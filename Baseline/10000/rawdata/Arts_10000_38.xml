In the first decade of the 21st century, the rise of computers as the primary means to record, distribute, store, and play music caused widespread economic changes in the [[music industry]], fundamentally changing the relationships between artists, record companies, promoters, retail music stores, the technology industry, and consumers. The rise of digital music consumption options contributed to a few fundamental changes in consumption. First the decline of album sales. With the A la carte sales models increasing in popularity, consumers no longer download entire albums but rather choose single songs.

&lt;!-- TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES --&gt;
The initial stage (from approximately 1998 to 2001) of the [[digital music]] revolution was the emergence of [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) networks that allowed the free exchange of music files (such as [[Kazaa]] and [[Napster (peer-to-peer)|Napster]]). By 2001, the cost of [[hard drive]] space had dropped to a level that allowed pocket-sized computers to store large libraries of music. The [[iPod]] and [[iTunes]] system for music storage and playback became immensely popular, and many consumers began to transfer their physical recording media (such as [[CD]]s) onto computer hard drives. The [[iTunes Music Store]] offered legal downloads beginning in 2003, and competitors soon followed, offering a variety of online music services, such as [[internet radio]]. Digital music distribution was aided by the widespread acceptance of [[broadband]] in the middle of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.shellypalmermedia.com/2008/12/07/broadband-and-retail-black-friday-and-cyber-247365/|title = Broadband and Retail: Black Friday and Cyber-24/7/365|accessdate = 24 November 2008|last = Palmer|first = Shelley|date = 7 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, recording software (such as [[Avid Technology|Avid]]'s [[Pro Tools]]) began to be used almost exclusively to make records, rendering expensive multitrack tape machines (such as the 1967 [[Studer]]) almost obsolete.

&lt;!-- DECLINE IN REVENUE --&gt;
The chief economic impact of these changes was a dramatic decline in revenues from recorded music. In the 21st century, consumers spent far less money on recorded music than they had in 1990s, in all formats. Total revenues for [[CD]]s, [[Gramophone record|vinyl]], [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]] and [[music download|digital downloads]] in the U.S. dropped from a high of $14.6 billion in 1999 to $9 billion in 2008.

The popularity of [[Music download|internet music distribution]] has increased and by 2007 more units were sold over the internet than in any other form.&lt;ref name="NYT2008"&gt;{{cite news

| last=Arango}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, as ''[[The Economist]]'' reported, "paid digital downloads grew rapidly, but did not begin to make up for the loss of revenue from CDs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2000s period stands in stark contrast from the "CD boom" of 1984-1995, when profit margins averaged above 30% and industry executives were notorious for their high profile, even frivolous spending.&lt;ref name=Knopper&gt;{{cite book| last=Knopper | first=Steve | year=2009 | title=Appetite for Self-Destruction: the Spectacular Crash of the Record Industry in the Digital Age | publisher=Free Press | ISBN=978-1-4165-5215-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- FAILURE IN THE INDUSTRY --&gt;
The major record labels consistently failed to heed warnings or to support any measures that embraced the change in technology.&lt;ref name=Knopper/&gt; In the early years of the decade, the industry fought illegal [[file sharing]], successfully shutting down [[Napster (peer-to-peer)|Napster]] in 2001 and threatening thousands of individuals with legal action. This failed to slow the decline in revenue and was a public relations disaster.&lt;ref name=Knopper/&gt; Some academic studies have even suggested that downloads were not the true cause of the decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--CHANGING RELATIONSHIPS ---&gt;
The turmoil in the industry changed the balance of power among all the various players. The major music-only stores such as [[Tower Records]] (which once wielded considerable influence in the industry) went bankrupt, replaced by [[box stores]] (such as [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Best Buy]]). Recording artists began to rely primarily on [[concert|live performance]]s and [[merchandise]] for their income, which in turn made them more dependent on [[music promoter]]s such as [[Live Nation]] (which dominates tour promotion and owns a large number of [[music venue]]s.)&lt;ref name="Live Nation"&gt;

In order to benefit from all of an artist's income streams, record companies began to rely on the "[[360 deal]]", a new business relationship pioneered by [[Robbie Williams]] and [[EMI]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At the other extreme, record companies also used simple manufacturing and [[distribution deal]]s, which gives a higher percentage to the artist, but does not cover the expense of marketing and promotion. Many newer artists no longer see any kind of "[[record deal]]" as an integral part of their [[business plan]] at all. Inexpensive recording hardware and software made it possible to create high quality music in a bedroom and distribute it over the internet to a worldwide audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

This, in turn, caused problems for [[recording studio]]s, [[record producer]]s and [[audio engineer]]s: the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that, by 2009, as many as half of the recording facilities in that city had failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Consumers benefited enormously from the ease with which music can be shared from computer to computer, whether over the internet or by the exchange of physical CDs. This has given consumers unparalleled choice in music consumption and has opened up performers to [[niche market]]s to which they previously had little access.&lt;ref name=Kusek/&gt; According to a Nielsen and Billboard report, in 2012 digital music sales topped the physical sale of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/05/technology/digital_music_sales/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Digital music sales top physical sales | date=5 January 2012 | accessdate=24 April 2012 | first1=Laurie | last1=Segall|authorlink=Laurie Segall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peer-to-peer (P2P) downloading==
===Dawn of P2P: Napster===

[[Napster (peer-to-peer)|Napster]] was an online music [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|file sharing]] service created by [[Shawn Fanning]] while he was attending [[Northeastern University]] in [[Boston]] and operating between June 1999 and July 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_33/b3694003.htm Napster's High and Low Notes] - ''Businessweek'' - 14 August 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Its technology allowed people to easily copy and distribute [[MP3]] files among each other, bypassing the established market for such songs and thus leading to the music industry's accusations of massive [[copyright violation]]s.

The first peer-to-peer case was ''[[A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.]]'', 239&amp;nbsp;F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001). The court found that Napster was contributory liable for the [[copyright infringement]] of its end-users because it "knowingly encourages and assists the infringement of plaintiffs' copyrights."&lt;ref&gt;Napster, at 1020.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original service was shut down by court order, it paved the way for larger decentralized peer-to-peer file-distribution programs such as [[Kazaa]], [[Morpheus (computer program)|Morpheus]], [[Grokster]], [[iMesh]], and [[Limewire]], which have been much harder to control because they practice more technically and legally creative approaches.&lt;ref name = Kusek&gt;David Kusek and Gerd Leonhard. (2005). "The Future of Music: Manifesto for the Digital Music Revolution". Berklee Press: Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

===File sharing and its effects===
{{Main|File sharing#Effects of file sharing|l1=Effects of file sharing}}
A number of studies have found that file sharing has a negative impact on record sales. Examples of such studies include three papers published in the April 2006 issue of the ''Journal of Law and Economics'' (Liebowitz, Rob and Waldfogel, Zentner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Stan J. |last=Liebowitz |title=File Sharing: Creative Destruction or Just Plain Destruction? |journal=[[The Journal of Law &amp; Economics]] |volume=49 |number=1 |date=April 2006 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1086/503518 |jstor=10.1086/503518 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Rafael |last1=Rob |first2=Joel |last2=Waldfogel |title=Piracy on the High C's: Music Downloading, Sales Displacement, and Social Welfare in a Sample of College Students |journal=[[The Journal of Law &amp; Economics]] |volume=49 |number=1 |date=April 2006 |pages=29–62 |doi=10.1086/430809 |jstor=10.1086/430809 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Alejandro |last=Zentner |title=Measuring the Effect of File Sharing on Music Purchases |journal=[[The Journal of Law &amp; Economics]] |volume=49 |number=1 |date=April 2006 |pages=63–90 |doi=10.1086/501082 |jstor=10.1086/501082 |subscription=yes|citeseerx=10.1.1.571.6264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alejandro Zentner]] notes in another paper published in 2005, that music sales had globally dropped from approximately $38 billion in 1999 to $32 billion in 2003, and that this downward trend coincides with the advent of [[Napster (peer-to-peer)|Napster]] in June 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Alejandro Zentner, [http://www.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1452&amp;context=bejeap "File Sharing and International Sales of Copyrighted Music: An Empirical Analysis with a Panel of Countries"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis &amp; Policy'', Vol. 5, Issue 1 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Using aggregate data [[Stan J. Liebowitz]] argues in a series of papers (2005, 2012) that file sharing had a significant negative impact on record sales.

In March 2007 the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' found that [[CD]] sales had dropped 20 percent in one year, which it interpreted as the latest sign of the shift in the way people acquire their music. BigChampagne LLC has reported that around one billion songs a month are being traded on illegal file-sharing networks. As a result of this decline in CD sales, a significant amount of record stores are going out of business and “...making it harder for consumers to find and purchase older titles in stores.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117444575607043728|title = Sales of Music, Long in Decline, Plunge Sharply|last = The Wall Street Journal|date = 21 March 2007 |accessdate = 12 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 19 December 2008, the ''Wall Street Journal'' reported the following:&lt;ref name = NoSuit&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122966038836021137?mod=googlenews_wsj|title = Music Industry to Abandon Mass Suits|accessdate = 23 December 2008|last = Sarah McBride and Ellen Smith|date = 19 December 2008 | work=The Wall Street Journal| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081221233718/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122966038836021137.html?mod=googlenews_wsj| archivedate= 21 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
After years of suing thousands of people for allegedly stealing music via the Internet, the recording industry is set to drop its legal assault as it searches for more effective ways to combat online music piracy. The decision represents an abrupt shift of strategy for the industry, which has opened legal proceedings against about 35,000 people since 2003. Critics say the legal offensive ultimately did little to stem the tide of illegally downloaded music. And it created a public-relations disaster for the industry, whose lawsuits targeted, among others, several single mothers, a dead person and a 13-year-old girl. Instead, the Recording Industry Association of America said it plans to try an approach that relies on the cooperation of Internet-service providers.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Digital business models==
With the explosion of formats and the creation of legitimate digital content, the [[IFPI]] observed that three main business models have risen to dominance. They are a-la-carte, [[subscription]] service, and [[advertisement]]-based.&lt;ref name = IFPI/&gt;

===A-la-carte (Download Store)===
A-la-carte is a service that sells individual songs, typically for $0.99 and now $1.29. They are known to consumers as "Download Stores". The leading provider is [[iTunes Store]] ([[Apple Inc.]]), who surpassed [[Wal-Mart]] to become the US’s largest music retailer in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/04/03itunes.html|title = iTunes Store Top Music Retailer in the US|accessdate = 24 November 2008|last = Apple Inc.|date = 3 April 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081123015344/http://www.apple.com./pr/library/2008/04/03itunes.html|archivedate = 23 November 2008|deadurl = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sector leaders include:
* [[iTunes Store]]
* [[Amazon.com]]
* [[7digital]]
* [[EMusic]]
* [[TuneTribe]]

Many hundreds more stores operate worldwide, often prominent only in particular countries or specialist genres. A third kind of operator never retails directly to the public, instead offering branded whitelabel stores and portals for organisations including bricks-and-mortar music stores, mobile telephony operators and ISPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/digital-music/article/where-can-i-get-music-online.aspx|title=BPI &amp;#124; Where can I get music online?|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whymusicmatters.org/find-music |title=Find Music &amp; Offers &amp;#124; Why Music Matters |accessdate=20 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65gMwicJb?url=http://www.whymusicmatters.org/find-music |archivedate=24 February 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some services which initially only offered streaming of tracks now also offer a-la-carte downloads, either through third parties (e.g. [[Spotify]]) or fully integrated ([[Deezer]], [[Juno Records|Juno Digital]], [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] etc.).

In 2009 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reported a [[price war]] between [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] and [[Amazon Music|Amazon MP3]]. Bill Carr, vice president of [[digital media]] for [[Amazon.com]] mentioned the following of [[digital music]] "one of the great benefits of the digital business versus the CD business is that we can experiment with price changes for an hour, a day or however long we like, with no impact on inventory".&lt;ref name = PriceWar&gt;Rolling Stone, Issue #1071, 2 February 2009, "Digital Albums Prices Slashed" p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subscription service===
A [[subscription]] service offers the consumer unlimited downloads for a monthly fee. This approach, according to the [[Open Music Model]], is theorized to maximize revenues in the long run. The sector leader is [[Napster (pay service)|Napster]],&lt;ref name = IFPI/&gt; which costs $12.95/month and offers 6 million downloads and now offers a $5 a month program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.napster.com|title=napster.com|accessdate = 24 November 2008|last = Napster, LLC| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080905101348/http://www.napster.com./| archivedate=5 September 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napster's net revenue for the quarter ending on 30 June 2008 was $30.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://investor.napster.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=327525|title = Napster Reports $30.3 Million in First Quarter Sales and Positive Results From New MP3 Initiative|accessdate = 24 November 2008|last = Napster, LLC|date = 11 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080916205901/http://investor.napster.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=327525 |archivedate = 16 September 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sector leaders include:
* [[Napster (pay service)|Napster]]
* [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]

===Advertisement-based service===
[[Advertisement]]-based services offer [[music]] free of charge to the consumer, while funding is derived from advertisement. The model is widespread as seen by the success of [[AOL Music]], [[Yahoo! Music]] and [[YouTube]] (multimedia provider). Many of these services are internet radio stations, as they offer continuous streaming music, while others are not continuously streaming. Many of these services offer multimedia or additional services. For example, [[MySpace]] (owned by [[Fox Interactive Media]]) offers [[social-networking]] as its flagship service. [[comScore]] reports the top 10 in internet radio viewership in the United States:

[[YouTube]] (owned by [[Google Inc.]]) is the premier site for finding music videos for both independent bands and mainstream bands that have released their music on CD or digitally, while also being useful for finding rare songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10125016-52.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1040_3-0-5|title = Finding rare songs on YouTube|accessdate = 23 December 2008|last = Terdiman|first = Daniel|date = 23 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube is a multimedia provider, so it is difficult to say how much entertainment it has provided to music consumers, however it did provide about one-third of all 11 billion online video views in the US in the month of April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://venturebeat.com/2008/06/17/online-video-continues-to-explode-googles-grip-tightens/|title = Online video continues to explode, Google’s grip tightens|accessdate = 24 November 2008|last = Kaplan|first = Dan|date = 17 June 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081202151657/http://venturebeat.com/2008/06/17/online-video-continues-to-explode-googles-grip-tightens/| archivedate= 2 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is also testing three new landing pages dedicated to the popular categories of news, movies, and music. Each page will be populated with the most popular content on the site related to that category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10126837-93.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1023_3-0-5|title = YouTube Launches HD Video Page|accessdate = 23 December 2008|last = Musil|first = Steven|date = 18 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have even hailed YouTube as being the "digital successor to [[MTV]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sci-tech-today.com/news/YouTube-Could-Become-Digital-MTV/story.xhtml?story_id=011001CEHOR9&amp;full_skip=1|title = YouTube Negotiating To Become a Digital MTV|accessdate = 9 March 2009|last = Jennifer LeClaire|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they seem to be positioning themselves in that manner. Currently, they have mixed relations with labels as evidenced by their icy relationship with [[Warner Music Group]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.macworld.co.uk/digitallifestyle/news/index.cfm?newsid=24110&amp;pagtype=allchandate|title = Warner threatens YouTube on music, pulls videos|accessdate = 9 March 2009|last = Lexton Snol|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more optimistic relationship with [[Universal Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10126439-93.html|title = Universal Music seeing 'tens of millions' from YouTube|accessdate = 9 March 2009|last = Greg Sandoval|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MySpace]] (owned by [[Fox Interactive Media]]) is also a key player and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reports that it hosts more than 70 million users monthly and that “visitors to the site can hear both [[Bob Dylan]]’s or [[The White Stripes]]' entire catalogue”. Unlike many services, MySpace has been successful in making copyright deals with the [[List of RIAA member labels#"Big Four" RIAA members|RIAA's "Big Four"]], which is [[Sony BMG]], [[Warner Music Group]], [[Universal Music]] and [[EMI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/23356455/myspace_music_takes_on_itunes|title = MySpace Music Takes on iTunes: Social-networking giant's new service streams millions of songs for free|accessdate = 24 November 2008|last = Browne|first = David|date = 16 October 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081003194554/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/23356455/myspace_music_takes_on_itunes |archivedate = 3 October 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; in September 2008. In January 2009, MySpace made partnerships with the following independent labels: [[Nettwerk]], INgrooves, Iris Distribution, RoyaltyShare, and Wind-up Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10143398-36.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1023_3-0-5|title = New indie partnerships for MySpace Music|accessdate = 18 January 2009|last = Caroline McCarthy|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, [[CNET News]] reported that there are more than 5 million bands with music on the streaming-and-discovery music service, and more than 100 million playlists have been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10194538-36.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1023_3-0-5|title = Catching up with MySpace Music|accessdate = 12 March 2009|last = Caroline McCarthy|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pandora Radio|Pandora Internet Radio]] is distinctive from both YouTube and MySpace in that it offers consumers continuously [[streaming media]] rather than non-continuous music, which makes it highly similar to [[radio|terrestrial radio]] or [[television]]. However, it can be contrasted with radio in that it offers [[recommender system|music recommendation]]. YouTube is similar to Pandora in that it also offers recommendation, but is distinct in that content is [[User-generated content|user-generated]].

A new type of service that has also become popular is sites that allow consumers to pay what they wish or pay by advertising on social networking sites. Sites like [[NoiseTrade.com]] and comeandlive.com are examples of sites that sponsor artists and allow users to download music in exchange for advertising for the artist. Music is essentially free to users essentially costing only the time it takes to post information about the artist downloaded on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], or email. Another example was the release of the [[Radiohead]] album ''In Rainbows'' in which users could download the album and name their own price. The idea of [[pay what you want]] music consumption is new, but catching on with users and growing.

==Format issues==
===Decline of analog, rise of digital===

''Note: These figures represent data collected only from RIAA member labels, which constitutes only a portion of total online music exchanged.''

Statistical analysis suggests the large-scale change in distribution:
* Full-length CD distribution (by percentage of total music revenue) peaked in 2004.
* Between 2004 and 2007, Full-length CD sales have experienced a linear decline of around 2% annually. During this time period, Digital Download has increased from 0.9% to 11.2%.
* Of the over 10% of total market growth taken by Digital Download, roughly 8% came from losses in Full-length CD sales.
* Full-length cassettes experienced the most loss (-14.5% market share) in the 10-Year period, although most of the loss (-13.1%) was experienced from 1998-2003. In 2007, they were outsold by Vinyl.
* {{as of|2007}}, only two formats had greater than 10% of the market: Full-length CDs and Digital Download.
* The ratio of digital to analog sales in 2004 it was roughly 1:99, but by 2007 it was roughly 1:9.

In 2008, physical album sales fell 20 percent to 362.6 million from 450.5 million, while digital album sales rose 32 percent to a record 65.8 million units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tahoedailytribune.com/article/20090108/ENTERTAINMENT/901079974/1005/NONE&amp;parentprofile=1056&amp;title=Another%20tough%20year%20for%20music%20industry|title = Another tough year for music industry|accessdate = 12 January 2009|last = John Gerome|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proliferation of formats===
The advent of digital media has led to the sudden creation of many new music formats available to the average consumer. In 2003 there were less than 10 formats available, but by 2007 there were over 100. Today a single artist release can be packaged in multiple formats including video downloads, ringtones or mobile full tracks. As the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 2003, music distribution formats were numbered in single figures – today, they number in the hundreds…In the digital era, record companies are licensing music across a multitude of platforms, in scores of different formats and with hundreds of different partners.&lt;ref name = "IFPI"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_statistics/index.html|title = Digital Music Report_2008|accessdate = 24 November 2008|last = International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|date=January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081205010520/http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_statistics/index.html| archivedate= 5 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mobile music==
===MP3 players===
Rise of [[MP3 players]], which are [[consumer electronics]] devices that stores, organizes and plays [[audio file format|audio files]]. Some DAPs (digital audio players) are also referred to as [[portable media player]]s as they have image-viewing and/or video-playing support. The first mass-produced DAP was created in 1997 by SaeHan Information Systems, which domestically sold its “MPMan” player in the middle of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6450_7-5622055-1.html |title=Introducing the world's first MP3 player |last=Van Buskirk |first=Eliot |publisher=[[CNET]] |accessdate=30 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121150259/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6450_7-5622055-1.html |archivedate=21 January 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2001, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] (now known as Apple Inc.) unveiled the [[iPod classic#First generation|first generation]] [[iPod]], the 5&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive based DAP with a 1.8" [[Toshiba]] drive. With the development of a minimalistic [[user interface]] and a smaller form factor, the iPod was initially notable within users of the [[Macintosh]] community. In July 2002, Apple introduced the second generation update to the iPod. It was compatible with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] computers through [[Musicmatch Jukebox]] (now known as Y!Music Musicmatch Jukebox). The iPod series, which grew to include [[microdrive]] and flash-based players, has become the market leader in DAPs.

===Smartphones===
The 21st century saw the birth of [[3G|3G enabled mobile phones]], which enables network operators to offer users a wider range of more advanced services while achieving greater network capacity through improved [[spectral efficiency]].

The key advantage of 3G enabled phones over MP3 players is their greater web integration. This enables users to readily access a far larger quantity of songs than MP3 player users can. For an MP3 player, songs must be stored before the user leaves their computer, but with 3G enabled phones the device is not separated from the source. In 2009, it was projected that revenue from mobile media and entertainment (MME) services in the US would more than double by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.digmedia.org/content/mediacenter.cfm?content=industrytrends|title = US mobile media and entertainment market to see stronger growth from 2010 onward, says Analysys|accessdate = 17 February 2009|last = Digital Media Association|date=April 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090221021349/http://www.digmedia.org/content/mediacenter.cfm?content=industrytrends |archivedate = 21 February 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other noteworthy developments==
===In the courtroom===
* On 19 December 2008, the [[RIAA]] announced that it would stop suing file sharers, because the strategy is not working to stop the flow of illegal downloads. Instead, the RIAA is trying to work with [[ISP]]s to prevent P2P piracy. "The decision represents an abrupt shift of strategy for the industry, which has opened legal proceedings against about 35,000 people since 2003".&lt;ref name = NoSuit/&gt;
* On 18 June 2009 [[CNET News]] reported [[Jammie Thomas-Rasset]] was found guilty of willful copyright infringement in a Minneapolis federal court and must pay the recording industry $1.92 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10268199-93.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1023_3-0-5|title = Court orders Jammie Thomas to pay RIAA $1.92 million|accessdate = 18 June 2009|last = Sandoval|first = Greg|date = 18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legal battle, ''[[Capitol Records, Inc. v. Thomas-Rasset]]'', marked the first time the recording industry has argued a [[file-sharing]] case before a jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9791383-7.html?tag=mncol;txt|title = RIAA Winds Key Victory; Accused Fire Sharer Must Pay $220,000|accessdate = 18 June 2009|last = Sandoval|first = Greg|date = 4 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In France, a new law regarding illegal downloading, called [[HADOPI]], is being debated. If passed, it would force the Internet provider to shut down the subscription while still receiving monthly payment. This double punishment is highly criticized.

===In politics===
* On 5 January 2009, president-elect [[Barack Obama]] appointed [[Thomas J. Perrelli]] to the position of [[United States Associate Attorney General]]. Perrelli represented the [[RIAA]] in a slew of cases, including a high-profile bid to unmask file sharers without the requirement of a judge reviewing the evidence first. Obama's selection of [[Joe Biden]] as [[vice president]] showed that the presidential hopeful was comfortable with someone with firmly pro-RIAA views. Biden urged the criminal prosecutions of copyright-infringing [[peer-to-peer]] users and tried to create a new federal [[felony]] involving playing unauthorized music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10133425-38.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1023_3-0-5|title = Obama picks RIAA's favorite lawyer for a top Justice post|accessdate = 9 January 2009|last = Declan McCullagh|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In video games===
* In the [[video game industry]], the music category overtook the sports category as no. 2 top category in sales, behind action. 58 percent of players played music games, second only to 65 percent who played action games. About 50 percent played sports games, down from 55 percent in 2007 and 62 percent in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://venturebeat.com/2008/10/20/music-video-games-overtake-sports-and-game-console-growth|title = Music video games overtake sports and game console growth|accessdate = 29 December 2008|last = Dean Takahashi|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video game industry was worth $22 billion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://venturebeat.com/2008/12/11/video-game-sales-defy-recession-rise-10-percent-in-november|title = Video game sales defy recession, rise 10 percent in November|accessdate = 29 December 2008|last = Dean Takahasahi|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'', which launched in 2007, has become the first single game to surpass $1 billion in sales. The announcement came during a [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] keynote by [[Activision]] Publishing CEO, Mike Griffith, and follows an announcement that the entire franchise had broken the same mark a year ago. Griffith said that ''[[Guitar Hero]]'''s monumental success has trickled down to other industries, most especially the struggling [[music industry]]. According to Griffith, sales of everything connected to ''Guitar Hero'', from music to real [[guitar]]s, has gone up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3172218|title = Guitar Hero 3 Surpasses $1 billion|accessdate = 12 January 2009|last = Kat Bailey|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Best New Horror===
Eddie Carroll is the editor of an annual anthology entitled ''America's Best New Horror''. As part of his job he has read and rejected many thousands of derivative stories, and he has become jaded by the process. When he reads the strangely disturbing story "Buttonboy" by Peter Kilrue, he regains his passion for his work. The plot concerns his search for the elusive Kilrue in an attempt to procure "Buttonboy" for the anthology.

===20th Century Ghost===
The Rosebud Theatre is an old style [[movie palace]], haunted by the semi-legendary spirit of a young woman. The girl died during a screening of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', appears infrequently throughout the Twentieth Century, and occasionally starts conversations with a select few moviegoers. The story is told by Alec Sheldon, the theatre owner, who worries about his approaching mortality and what will happen to the Rosebud after he retires.

===Pop Art===
This story was originally published in 2001 in an anthology titled ''With Signs &amp; Wonders'' by Invisible Cities Press. In 2007, [[Subterranean Press]] produced a limited edition chapbook of "Pop Art" limited to 150 numbered copies and 52 lettered copies. These books were only available through the publishers website.

The plot concerns the friendship of two socially outcast boys: the narrator, who has a dysfunctional home life, and his only friend, a human boy made of inflatable plastic who has loving and supportive flesh-and-blood parents. [[Christopher Golden]] called it one of the best short stories in years.

===You Will Hear The Locust Sing===
The story of a boy who wakes up one morning to find that he has become a giant, human-sized insect.

===Abraham's Boys===
[[Abraham Van Helsing]], living in America following the events of ''[[Dracula]]'', tries to teach his sons about vampires.

===Better Than Home===
Story about a troubled boy whose father manages a baseball team.

===The Black Phone===
Thirteen-year-old John Finney is kidnapped by a man named Al. Trapped in a basement room, the boy's only hope may lie in a mysterious disconnected black phone hanging on the basement wall. The phone rings at night with the whispers of the kidnapper's previous (and now dead) victims.

===In The Rundown===
A video store clerk comes upon a grisly scene on a weedy dirt lane.

===The Cape===
Seven-year-old Eric learns that he can fly (well, sort of) while wearing his blue cape. After suffering a terrible injury he thinks the cape is lost, only to find the cape again years later.

===Last Breath===
The story concerns Dr. Allinger, an old man who runs a "Museum of Silence" which contains the last breaths of various people, some being famous figures such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

=== Bobby Conroy Comes Back From The Dead ===
A failed comedian meets his now-married ex-girlfriend during the filming of the [[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]] movie.

===My Father's Mask===
Thirteen-year-old Jack's parents take him on an unexpected trip to their cabin on Big Cat Lake. Along the way they play a game made up by Jack's mother in which they are being chased by the "playing card people". At the cabin Jack finds various masks, which he is told must be worn to disguise themselves from the playing card people. Jack grows weary of the game, but soon he finds that it may not be a game at all.

'''Alternate ending''' ([[British English]]: '''alternative ending''') is a term used (usually in movies) to describe the ending of a story that was planned or debated but ultimately unused in favor of the actual ending. Generally, alternative endings are considered to have no bearing on the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] narrative. On the internet, amateurs may make their own alternative endings.

==Examples in film==
Alternative endings are often filmed before being scrapped, and may be subsequently included as a special feature in the film's [[DVD]] release. These alternative endings are a special type of [[deleted scene]]. In other cases, ideas that were presented but discarded early on are alluded to by the production team in commentary or interviews.

Some films or movies also present the alternative ending on International releases as well as their international Home media release, with its original region release only showing the alternative ending on certain TV channels.

The following are examples of known alternative endings to movies:
*''[[1408 (film)|1408]]'': An alternative ending is present on the director's cut disc (much like ''The Butterfly Effect'', with a few deleted scenes reinserted) Mike Enslin dies in the fire he causes. At his burial, his wife is approached by the hotel manager, offering his personal belongings. She refuses, and he lets her know that her husband did not die in vain. Back in his vehicle he listens to the tape recorder, and screams in fear as he sees Enslin's burned deformed body in his back seat for only a moment. The film closes with an apparition of Mike Enslin still in 1408, muttering to himself, hears his daughter's voice, and finally exiting the room with her.
*''[[28 Days Later]]'': Several darker alternative endings (filmed, available on the DVD release). The first has Jim gravely injured near the end of the film and he is taken to a hospital, but he dies before he can be given medical attention, and his body is left behind (completing a cycle in the movie; he woke up alone in a hospital and has now died there). Some versions also involve him dreaming of the accident that put him in the hospital at the beginning of the film. Another unfilmed ending picks up after Frank has been infected, where they take him to a research complex and Jim sacrifices his own life to give him a total blood transfusion to restore him, and he is once again left alone in a hospital bed. This was discarded for being too unbelievable.
*''[[3 Ninjas]]'': The American cut originally showed that the boys had won the basketball challenge and effortlessly won Emily's bike back. In an extended international version of this movie, they lose the basketball challenge along with their own bikes, so a scene ends the international version of the film in which they fight the bullies to get them back, as an alternative ending. In the United States, this alternative ending can only be seen on certain television channels such as ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'', [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] and [[Showtime MAX]]; international [[DVD]]s have this version, as well.
*''[[Army of Darkness]]'': In an alternative ending after Ash drinks the potion that would make him sleep long enough to wake up in his own time, he inadvertently drinks too much and wakes up in the future. Realizing that the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Ash screams "I slept too long!"
*''[[The Astronaut's Wife]]'': When Spencer is killed, Jillian is not possessed by the alien. Instead, she moves out to the country. Sitting beneath a tree, looking up at the stars, she tunes her radio to the same signals Spencer was receiving while possessed by the alien - her twin babies controlling her movements from inside the womb, listening - and waiting...
*''[[Blade: Trinity]]'': The original ending is far more ambiguous with Dracula and Blade's fates not as determined. The ending only appears in the unrated DVD and was intended by the director [[David S. Goyer]]. Another alternate ending was seen showing Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler confront a werewolf.
*''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'': An alternative ending on the DVD has Bourne collapsing during the search for Marie, waking up with Abbot standing over him, and getting an offer to return to the CIA.
*''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'': Evan watches a home video of his mother pregnant with him and returns to the memory of himself as a fetus. Convinced that his very existence has ruined the lives of those around him, he strangles himself with his [[umbilical cord]] and dies, [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. This "[[Director's Cut]]" ending is much darker than the theatrical ending, where he simply stops himself from becoming friends with Kayleigh.
*''[[Child's Play 2]]'': An extended ending reveals that a chunk of Chucky's skin after his head exploded got mixed in with the Good Guy doll making plaster. A machine is then seen making a new Good Guy Doll head, which then forms a sinister smile.
*''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'': After defeating the Kraken and Hades, Andromeda falls into the sea and Perseus dives in to save her. When he reaches her, he embraces her with a passionate kiss, indicating that he fell in love with her, and she with him. After reaching the shore and regaining consciousness, Andromeda asks Perseus if he will stay and he says there is someone he needs to talk to, before kissing her again, indicating that he will come back. Getting on Pegasus, he flies to Mt. Olympus (although the special effects are incomplete) where he confronts Zeus, stating that he does not wish to be one of them and that any conflict between them has just started. After slamming his sword into the gods' map and shattering the models of every living person, he leaves and is seen flying on Pegasus over the sea, presumably back to Argos (although the special effects are incomplete).
*''[[Clerks]]'': Dante is still inside the Quick Stop after it closes. A customer enters and, without saying a word, shoots Dante after he tells him they are closed, and empties the cash register. The credits then roll, and when they are over a customer comes in and sees the counter empty without noticing Dante's body on the ground behind the counter.
*''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'' had four different endings, and each one distributed to theatres had one of ''three'' of them. The video and DVD version had all of these three endings on it. The fourth one has not been included because the director did not approve of it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088930/alternateversions&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'': In an alternative ending found on the special edition DVD it is presumed that Simon's robbery of the Federal Reserve succeeds, with McClane catching up with Gruber months later in Austria. McClane's police career is in ruins, and he is keen to take it out on Gruber, who he invites to play a game called "McClane Says". This involves a form of Russian Roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher with the sights removed, meaning it cannot be determined which end is which. McClane then asks Gruber some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Gruber gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which blows Gruber to bits. This ending is in the novelization, only McClane fools Gruber into thinking the tube-like launcher is pointed at McClane. Gruber guesses the trick question and shoots himself.
*''[[Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story]]'': The Average Joes lose the game when White Goodman hits Peter with the ball. According to the DVD commentary, this was the writer's original intention for the movie, but the studio insisted it be changed - hence the "real" ending - when test audiences reacted poorly to the unhappy ending. (The antagonist references this right at the end of the movie, by mocking the audience for wanting a happy ending and saying, "You happy now?")
*''[[Ella Enchanted (film)|Ella Enchanted]]'': The movie was originally supposed to end in a scene after the wedding, where Hattie is turned into a frog by Lucinda, Ella's father demands a divorce from Dame Olga, Heston is still alive but suffering torment from the Char Fan Club, Slannen becomes a lawyer, and Dame Olga ends up with Nish. No one knows why, but they cut the scene out and replaced the ending with a musical ending with the entire cast present and they exit like they do on stage.
*''[[Fatal Attraction]]'': Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) was originally scripted to commit suicide at the end of the movie and make it look like Dan (Michael Douglas) had murdered her, for which he was arrested. Test audiences did not respond well to this finale, mainly due to a lack of revenge from Beth and the family, especially when Beth tells Alex "If you ever come near my family again, I'll kill you". This resulted in a three-week re-shoot for the action-filled sequence in the bathroom and Alex's death by shooting. The fact that Beth shoots Alex makes a direct comparison between the two characters, Alex being a victim, and Beth taking control to protect her family.
*''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'': Alex is killed when he grabs the downed power line to save Claire, ending Death's pattern. In the final scene it turns out that Claire is pregnant with Alex's baby.
*''[[Final Destination 2]]'': The original movie was supposed to end with Kimberly and Officer Burke embracing in the hospital after Kimberly is revived. Instead, David Ellis, the director, decided to end the film with a bang and include the barbecue scene.
*''[[Final Destination 3]]'': The film has two alternative endings (based on the viewer's choices on the DVD). In the first ending, Ian is fully crushed by the sign and Wendy, Kevin, and Julie decide what to do next. In the second ending, which involves the subway, the train headed for Wendy actually hits her, instead of being a vision.
*''[[The Final Destination]]'': In one alternative ending, Nick realizes he has to kill himself for the chain to end. So, he puts out the initial fire and then jumps out a window, killing himself. Later, Janet and Lori sadly embrace, as Lori says, "The chain is broken." Suddenly, a piece of the chain holding the A/C unit breaks and lands next to Lori. Lori picks it up, and the unit drops and crushes Lori and Janet, with Lori's hand holding the chain sliding into the audience's face in 3D. In another, Nick is also crushed with Lori in the escalator, instead of it being a vision.
*''[[Final Destination 5]]'': In an alternative ending, which was in the original script, Sam, Molly and Nathan take a walk through memorial park believing they finally cheated Death but Death is still in action after Nathan is crushed by Flight 180's landing gear while Sam and Molly stare at him in horror.
*''[[First Blood]]'': In an alternative ending, Rambo commits suicide rather than be arrested. This alternate ending is included as an extra on the First Blood Ultimate Edition DVD released in 2004.
*''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'': Chris wakes up the morning after killing Jason, only to find he is still alive when she opens the back door of the lake house. Jason then proceeds to cut off Chris's head, and the scene immediately switches to Chris waking up screaming in the back of the police car, revealing her entire death was a dream and Jason remains dead in the barn.
*''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'': An alternative ending to the film, included in the 2009 Deluxe Edition DVD, shows a dream sequence where Trish and Tommy wake up the next morning after killing Jason to the sound of police sirens. Trish sends Tommy to summon the police who have arrived next door. At that point she notices water dripping from the ceiling and goes to investigate. She enters the upstairs bathroom, and finds the body of her mother, drowned in the bathtub. At that moment, Mrs. Jarvis' eyes open and Jason appears behind Trish, ready to strike. Trish then suddenly wakes up in the hospital in a scene reminiscent of the ending of the first movie. In his commentary, the director says this scene was cut because it interfered with the idea that this would be the final film.
*''[[Game of Death]]'': This movie has two alternative endings. In the [[Hong Kong]] [[Cantonese]]  print, after we see Billy defeating Dr. Land, who falls from the rooftop, the police and an ambulance arrives there. The police arrest Billy and the ambulance takes Dr. Land. In the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] print it shows that after defeating Dr. Land, Billy is with Ann at a harbour, saying good-bye to Jim. The next scene shows a ship departing and a picture of [[Bruce Lee]]. This scene of the ship departing is also in the Hong Kong ending.
*''[[Happy Death Day]]'': An alternative ending has Tree recovering in the hospital from her ordeal with Lori, while being visited by her father and Carter. After they leave, a nurse enters to administer pain medication to Tree, with Tree stating that it was against doctor's orders. The nurse later reveals herself as Stephanie Butler, the wife of Dr. Gregory Butler, and she later kills Tree out of revenge for her affair with Gregory.
*''[[Hide and Seek (2005 film)|Hide and Seek]]'': This movie had many different endings on whether [[Dakota Fanning]]'s character, Emily had split personality and whether she ended up at a mental hospital or at a new home.
*''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'': The "Monster Woman" that Robert Neville captures in order to run a "cure" test becomes the key to his survival in the end. As the "Alpha Monster" begins to break into the lab area, he stops, and Robert Neville suddenly realizes that all they want is the "Monster Woman" back. So Robert Neville rolls her out of the lab and awakens her out of her medicated state, and the "Alpha Monster" picks her up and takes her away, leaving Neville alive after his ordeal. (NOTE: The creatures are a mutation from man's cure to cancer)
*''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'': In the alternative ending, Julie receives an invite to a pool party and reads an email that reads "I still know". This scene was used in the trailer for the film.
*''[[Infernal Affairs]]'': In the mainland Chinese version, the police found evidence proving Lau Kin Ming ([[Andy Lau]]) is a triad mole and is arrested and the film end. The sequel, ''[[Infernal Affairs III]]'', follows the original Hong Kong ending where Lau got away with his crime.
*''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'': In one of the most famous changed endings, the original conclusion to the off-Broadway musical was filmed and preferred by Frank Oz the director and the majority of the actors. However, test audiences disliked how Audrey and Seymour, the main protagonists, were both killed by the evil alien plant, and the ending had to be re-shot so that their deaths were removed.
*''[[Men in Black II]]'': The original ending for the film featured a scene in which the towers of the World Trade Center opened to release a swarm of UFOS. After the terrorist attacks in 2001, the ending was reshot.
* ''[[Orphan (2009 film)|Orphan]]'': In an alternative ending, Esther is seen hurrying into her room. There, she is shown with a face covered in blood while she re-applies her makeup. She then puts on the dress she wore for her first day of school and greets the police, who arrived after receiving Kate's frantic call before she reached the house, at the top of the stairs by curtsying and introducing herself, and then she is seen descending the stairs into the crowd of police. It is not explained whether or not she has killed Kate or Max in the alternative ending, although the dead body of John can be seen. However, due to the excess blood on Esther's face in the alternative ending and the fact that she is not wet, it is a possibility that she killed both Max and Kate.
*''[[Paranormal Activity]]'': In one version of the film that was shown at only one public viewing, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera, then slits her own throat. There is a third ending in which, after killing Micah, Katie returns to the bedroom and sits down against the bed with the knife in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Katie's sister comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, and scares Katie's sister out of the house, before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth. The police arrive at the house about 30 minutes later, and Katie comes out of the bedroom with her knife, calling for Micah. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind the officers slams shut, causing the officers to shoot Katie.
*''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'': Jennings and Rachel are wondering what to do next when Jennings spots the kid who stole the engagement ring from him on the subway coming out of a pawn shop. He goes into the shop for a few minutes and when he comes back he asks Rachel "do you believe in fate?" and they kiss. It is assumed he then proposes to her because it fades to black at that point.
*''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'': Both main characters are killed off by a man they forgot to shoot down.
*''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'': [[Rocky Balboa|Rocky]] defeats [[Mason Dixon (Rocky Balboa character)|Mason "The Line" Dixon]] by split decision. In the actual movie, it is reversed.
*''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'': Deirdre is seen on the stairs next to the café considering joining Sam and Vincent. Deciding against it, she walks up the stairs. As she is getting into her car, she is snatched into a van by men in the IRA who call her a traitor. It is implied that she is later killed. Sam and Vincent finish their conversation and depart, completely unaware of what has just happened.
*''[[Scream 3]]'': When [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] enters the screening room, he does not have a white sheet covering him. After Roman notices [[Sidney Prescott]] has disappeared after he supposedly killed her, he searches the screening room for her shouting and telling her all the doors are locked, most of the scene shows Sidney's point of view which was not shown in the actual ending. Also, Kincaid does not enter the screening room in this ending.
*''[[Scary Movie 3]]'': Cindy is told Cody does not exist. After hitting a few people in the face with a shovel, Cindy asks everybody who is not real to stand a specific spot. Cody goes there, and is followed by [[Santa Claus]]. The aliens then begin to invade but George stops them by transforming into [[Hulk (comics)|The Hulk]]. President Harris tries to hulk out, but ends up soiling his pants. Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabithas. She wins the battle by performing moves from ''The Matrix'' and teleports back to the Logan House. The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified to learn that the driver happens to be [[M. Night Shyamalan]].
*''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'': Writer, Andrew Kevin Walker, completed two separate drafts of the ending. The first was used in the theatrical edition of the film. In the second, John Doe is killed by Somerset instead of Mills. This alternate ending sequence was storyboarded and is included in the published script, but never filmed, however it does appear on an extra disk on the DVD Release.
*''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]'': Sharon Stone and the killer fly over a volcano when the killer suddenly confesses his crimes. He then veers the aircraft into the volcano as the end credits roll and leaves the audience to decide whether they survive.
*''[[Smokin' Aces]]'': Rather than pulling the life support cords of Israel and Sparazza as he does in the used ending, he instead draws his weapon and empties his pistol into them.
*''[[Super Troopers]]'': Another ending was filmed that starts the same way as the real ending; by the police station being closed down. This time, the former officers are now working in a meat packing plant. They talk to their boss saying that bad meat should not be sent out for people to buy, and the boss says to do it any way. At this point the officers take off their jacket to reveal that they are now local police officers and chase him throughout the meat packing plant.
*''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]'': The DVD version contains an alternative ending wherein Ginger is told in the bank that the account is already empty, alluding to the possibility that Stanley has played one final trick on them and taken the money himself. In a companion scene to the alternative ending, Stanley is shown on a trip with his daughter in a brand new RV. While eating at a diner, Stanley is shown transferring many billion dollars to various charities before continuing his trip.
*''[[The Terminator]]'': The alternative ending, included in some DVD releases, shows the cleanup and police response at the factory shortly after the final battle between Kyle and the terminator. A group of company representatives find the terminator wreckage and decide to hide it from police and have it analyzed. The film then ends by the screen panning out to show that the factory was owned by Cyberdyne Systems. The sequel is based on this alternative ending.
*''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'': The alternative ending shows Sarah Connor alive and well on August 29, 2029. She is by then a grandmother (and John Connor is a Senator) in a world where Skynet was never able to start its war on humanity.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'': Old Rose is seen by her granddaughter dropping the diamond into the ocean.
*''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'': While Nicole and Michèle waiting in front of Stade Charléty, there was a duel between André and Jacques in the French football stadium. Jacques is shot down by a sniper. This ending was poorly received by audiences during test screenings.
*''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'': Not only different endings were intended to use in this film, but nearly a whole different plot, significantly the role of [[Jean Grey]] being more aggressive and disobeying direct orders of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] several times. The alternative endings are: the re-opening of the Xavier Institute in which [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] is now a professor; [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] coming back to [[Alberta, Canada]], specifically the very same tavern seen in the first ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''; and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] keeping her powers.
* ''[[Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' had two different endings. One had Lady Totington marrying PC Mackintosh and another had Lady Totington visiting Wallace and giving Gromit the golden carrot.
* ''[[Whisper (film)|Whisper]]'': In the alternative ending, the kidnapper Max has chased the demon boy David through the forest David makes him believe the wolves around him are the people who died. When they turn into wolves, they attack Max, but instead of throwing the axe and hitting David, Max holds on to the axe as he falls and the wolves maul him to death. Afterwards, the cops show up and wrap David up in a blanket and take him to safety. As the police van leaves, you can see David smiling.

==Examples in television==
In TV shows, producers may want to keep the ending of an episode a secret, even if it means keeping it from the stars themselves. In such a case, they will usually film more than one ending and not tell the cast which one will be used.
*''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'': To keep the ending to Season 1 a surprise, the crew shot multiple endings to the finale (Teri's death was the one they aired). A second ending had Teri live through the gunshot, and a third had her not being shot at all, with the family embracing each other after the long day was over.
*''[[D.I.E]]'': In original ending, Yue Sir ([[Roger Kwok]]) dies from a car accident and the audience wanted a happier ending so TVB created a new one in the style of [[mo lei tau]] comedy. In the new ending, the cast tries to stop the car accident that would kill Yue Sir from happening.
*''[[E.U. (TV series)|E.U.]]'': Due to the popularity of [[Michael Tse]]'s character Laughing Gor, who died in episode 22, an ending was shot where Laughing changes into his police uniform and talks. The ending never implied whether Laughing is alive or not and leaves it open for the audience to decide.
*''[[Green Wing]]'': In the final [[Green Wing Special|Special]], Guy and Mac are dragged into the air in an attempt to rescue Caroline, who has been dragged into the air by holding too many helium balloons. Whilst in the air, Mac tells Caroline he has something to tell her. After walking into the sea, Alan and Joanna are last seen hanging onto a buoy, waiting to drown. The actors wanted to use this ending but it was turned down. It was thought that this ending would have been used if a third series was being made.
*''[[Sex and the City]]'': In the series finale three endings were shot, in which [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'': (1) becomes engaged to [[Aleksandr Petrovsky]], (2) resumes her relationship with [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]], and (3) turns down both suitors and reaffirms her love for her friends.
*''[[The Simpsons]]'': In the two part episode "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]" there was an alternative ending where it was revealed that the shooter of Mr. Burns was [[Waylon Smithers]] rather than [[Maggie Simpson]]. Shots of other characters shooting Mr. Burns were also fully animated, though no other complete ending scenes were produced. (These alternative shootings were intended to be intentionally 'leaked' as an elaborate practical joke on the media, but the producers could find no journalists who would take the bait.)
*''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'': At the end of Season 4, the audience learns that one of the main characters will die in the future. To keep the identity of this person a secret, three different versions of the final scene were shot. The canonical ending shows that Locke will die, while the alternative endings had Sawyer and Desmond die.
*''[[Total Drama]]'': For every season of this animated "reality show", 2 endings were filmed in which both finalists would win the competition. Every country Total Drama aired in got to decide which ending to air.
*''[[King of the Hill]]'': Some episodes have alternative endings (including the episode "The Company Man"), which can be found on the DVD Special Features.
*''[[Psych]]'': the episode "100 Clues", a parody of the board game Clue, had alternate endings where the fans decided  who was the culprit of murdering a guest at a party. Also, the episode "Right Turn or Left for Dead" involves the main character, Shawn, playing out an alternative ending to the episode in his head had events in the previous episode been slightly different.
*''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'': In the episode, "The Lady Killer," three endings were shot, each revealing a member of the A-Team. Because the producers wanted to keep this member a secret from everyone (including the cast members), they shot three endings and did not tell anyone who the member of the A-Team was. Out of Paige's alternate ending, Caleb's ending, and Toby's ending, the producers ended up showing Toby's.
*''[[Secrets and Lies (U.S. TV series)|Secrets and Lies]]'': In order to keep the real killer's identity secret until the end, several multiple endings were shot.

==Examples in video games==
{{Main|Types_of_fiction_with_multiple_endings#Video_games|l1=Video games with multiple endings}}
Many video games also have alternative endings. These endings are generally posed after completing the game in a harder difficulty, or taking a different route through the game's storyline.

==Examples in music==
*English rock band [[Marillion]]'s 1994 [[concept album]] ''[[Brave (Marillion album)|Brave]]'' is one of the very few examples of an alternative ending appearing in the medium of music. The vinyl edition of ''Brave'' featured a [[multisided record|double groove]] on side B of the second record, the final side of the album: depending on where the needle was dropped, the record would either play the standard track listing (the songs "The Great Escape" and "Made Again") or would instead play only an alternative version of "The Great Escape" with different lyrics, presenting an alternative, darker ending to the album's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/brave.htm |title=Marillion – 'Brave' |publisher=marillion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in literature==
* [[Felix Salten]]’s ''[[The Hound of Florence]]'' differs greatly in the original [[German language]] (''Der Hund von Florenz'') and in the [[English language|English]] translation. The German-language version ends in [[tragedy]]: the archduke stabs the dog to death, killing Lukas, and his body is disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Wien | publisher=Herz-Verlag | date=1923 | language=German | page=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the English translation, a wholly new ending of six more pages has been written: Lukas survives, gets medication and is united with the [[courtesan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=The Hound of Florence: A Novel | date=1930 | location=New York | publisher=Simon and Schuster | translator=Huntley Paterson | others=Illustrated by Kurt Wiese | pages=230– }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is not known if the alternate ending is authorized.

The American artist collaborative, '''Anonima Group''', was founded in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] in 1960 by Ernst Benkert, Francis Hewitt and Ed Mieczkowski. Propelled by their rejection of the cult of the ego and automatic style of the [[Abstract Expressionists]], the artists worked collaboratively on grid-based, spatially fluctuating drawings and paintings that were precise investigations of the scientific phenomena and psychology of optical perception. The work was accompanied by writings: proposals, projects and manifestos - socialist in nature - which the artists considered essential to the experience and understanding of their work. Their drawings, paintings and writings, which had much in common with the positions of artist [[Ad Reinhardt]], and with the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]], were included in the 1965 ''[[The Responsive Eye|Responsive Eye]]'' exhibit at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. Along with other artists in the exhibit, Anonima's work was incorrectly relegated to what came to be the highly commercialized and publicized category of [[Op Art]]. A recent reconsideration and recontextualization of Op Art, the expansive 2006 Optic Nerve exhibit at the [[Columbus Museum of Art]], places the Anonima as the sole American collaborative group, along with the European [[Zero Group]], [[Gruppo N]], [[GRAV]] and others, who were examining new optical information at that time.

Francis Hewitt, who had a masters in art and later did course work toward a PhD in the psychology of perception, provided the conceptual framework for the Anonima Group; their projects addressed the latest information about the science and psychology of visual perception. Anonima's anti-commercial stance (see statement below), including their ultimate refusal to interact with the commercial artworld, had the effect of removing them from the lexicon of known artists from that time. In a catalog essay for Frank Hewitt's 1992 retrospective at the [[Robert Hull Fleming Museum]] in Burlington, Vermont, William C. Lipke wrote that the artists believed that "commercialization and popularization obfuscated the real issues" being addressed by their work. Further he writes that work by Anonima is "better understood in light of the theories and data of perceptual psychology; the commitment to a systemic study of visual information irrespective of stylistic or economic pressures."

The Anonima group disbanded in 1971, but the effect of their work has extended into the present through their writing, drawings and paintings. The group's analytical and impersonal view of the creative process was balanced by a profound generosity of spirit which has influenced countless artists over the years; all three artists have had long teaching careers (Frank Hewitt died in 1992), in which they dedicated themselves to providing art students with a precise understanding of the constructs of optical perception, an invaluable foundation for any artist. Their ideas are reflected in the work of many contemporary artists.

The '''Big Sur Land Trust''' is a private [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit located in [[Monterey, California]] that has played an instrumental role in preserving land in California's [[Big Sur]] and [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]] regions. The trust was the first to conceive of and use the "conservation buyer" method in 1989 by partnering with government and developers to offer tax benefits as an inducement to sell land at below-market rates.&lt;ref name=walton2007/&gt; {{as of|2016}}, it has protected around {{convert|40000|acre|ha|0}} through acquisition and resale to government agencies. It has added [[conservation easement]]s to another {{convert|17000|acre|ha|0}}&lt;ref name=bsltabout/&gt;&lt;ref name=bsltfaq&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigsurlandtrust.org/frequently-asked-questions.htm|title= Big Sur Land Trust FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has retained ownership of a number of parcels totaling about {{convert|4500|acre|ha|0}}.

The trust was founded in 1978 by a small group of local Big Sur residents who were members of the Big Sur Citizens' Advisory Committee. Four of the residents visited the San Francisco offices of [[The Trust for Public Land]] in 1977 where they learned about land-trust finance and management.  They decided to form an organization that could promote environmental protection in keeping with the Coast Master Plan and the [[California Coastal Commission]]. In February 1978 the community members incorporated The Big Sur Land Trust as a nonprofit California corporation.  Their original aim was to protect Big Sur's natural beauty "from over development without recourse to government control while recognizing a property owners' right to sell to whomever they wish".&lt;ref name=walton2007/&gt; The trust has partnered with many public and private agencies and organizations to protect land.

The trust has been criticized for some of its deals that have benefited wealthy individuals and for an instance when a board member who was also a public official did not disclose their apparent conflict of interest to affected parties. Some object to the trust buying private land and selling it to public agencies.

== History ==

In 1977, a small group of local Big Sur residents were appointed by Monterey County to the Big Sur Citizens' Advisory Committee.  They were assisting the county in developing a Coast Master Plan for Big Sur.&lt;ref name=founders/&gt; Retired oil company executive Earl Moser, who helped lead an effort to prevent building a refinery at Moss Landing near Monterey, chaired the effort.&lt;ref name="walton2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Walton|first1=J.|title=The Land of Big Sur: Conservation on the California Coast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822020712/http://www.johnwaltonphd.com/articles/the-land-of-big-sur.pdf |archivedate=August 22, 2016|url=http://www.johnwaltonphd.com/articles/the-land-of-big-sur.pdf|publisher=[[University of California]] |journal=California History |volume=85|number=1 |year=2007 |accessdate=September 8, 2016|pages=44–64|doi=10.2307/25161929|jstor=25161929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diverse group shared a common mistrust held by Big Sur residents of added government. They knew local groups were already upset by what they viewed as the California state park's lack of responsiveness to local concerns. &lt;ref name=anderson1218/&gt; The Coast Master Plan and the laws enforced by the [[California Coastal Commission]] published new rules for clean air and water, protecting land and sea, endangered species, disposing of hazardous waste  and procedures for evaluating new development along the coast with environmental impact reports. A group of Big Sur residents decided to form their own organization that could promote environmental protection reflecting the desires of the people who lived there. &lt;ref name="walton2007"/&gt;

The Big Sur Land Trust is well-regarded and ranked alongside notable trusts like Washington's [[San Juan Preservation Trust]], Wyoming's [[Jackson Hole Land Trust]], New York's [[Adirondacks Land Trust]], and [[Maine Coast Heritage Trust]]. &lt;ref name="walton2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anderson1218"/&gt;

=== Founders ===

In 1978, seven families formed the Big Sur Land Trust. They envisioned preserving the iconic Big Sur landscape for the benefit of future generations. The founding members were Zad Leavy, an experienced attorney and his wife Laela, Sherna and Kipp Stewart, Roger and Beverly Newell, Nancy Hopkins, Lloyd and Pat Addleman, Martin and Suzanne Forster and Peter Harding. Hopkins, daughter- in-law of Hewlett Packard founder [[David Packard]], became the trust's first president. Attorney Zad Leavy became its first executive director and served for 25 years. &lt;ref name=founders&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigsurlandtrust.org |title=Founders |accessdate=July 28, 2016|publisher=Big Sur Land Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Board of Trustees ===

The Big Sur Land Trust is governed by a board of trustees.&lt;ref name=bsltabout/&gt; {{as of|2015}}, the board had 16 board members, including 12 trustees and four administrators: board chair, co-chair, treasurer and secretary. Board members represent local and regional powerbrokers. The board is supported by a 10-member advisory council. &lt;ref name=bslttrustees&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigsurlandtrust.org/board-of-trustees.htm |title=Big Sur Land Trust Trustees}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donors include a [[Who's Who]] of local philanthropists. Individuals can join the trust for a $50 annual fee, which also grants them access by payment of an entrance fee to the trust's privately-owned lands. &lt;ref name="anderson1218"/&gt; The trust is operated by a professional staff and supported by hundreds of members and volunteers. &lt;ref name=bslttrustees/&gt;

=== Changes mission emphasis ===

When it was founded in 1978, the trust's mission was to conserve important waters and lands along California's Central Coast and focus on purchasing property for conservation in perpetuity. &lt;ref name=walton2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=bsltfaq/&gt; It has emphasized conserving unique landscapes on the California central coast including stream spawning beds for threatened steelhead trout, coastal redwoods, grasslands and oak woodlands. Along with its land acquisition and conservation easements activities, the trust engages in environmental education. &lt;ref name=bsltfaq/&gt;

In 2014, as land values increased and public agency budgets shrank, the trust remodeled how it presents itself to the public, shifting away from emphasizing its considerable land holdings to focus on the well-being of people and land stewardship on the Central Coast. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Website Map for Big Sur Land Trust|url=http://www.greeninfo.org/work/project/website-map-for-big-sur-land-trust|website=GreenInfo Network|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's striving to allow more people to gain access to the land it has protected. &lt;ref name=walton2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=bsltmission&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigsurlandtrust.org/press-release-big-sur-land-trust-adopts-new-mission-statement-3.htm |title=Big Sur Land Trust New Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trust now manages several properties within Monterey County.

In February 1978, as the trust was being formed, it received an undivided half-interest in {{convert|26|acre|ha|0}} just north of the [[Esalen Institute]] from its co-founder [[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]].&lt;ref name=walton2007/&gt; The national [[Trust for Public Land]] held the half-interest in the Esalen land until the Big Sur trust's federal tax-exempt status was approved by the Internal Revenue Service. &lt;ref name=walton2007/&gt; Founding member Peter Harding donated the $1,250 filing fee. The mother of one of Murphy's neighbors gave the trust leaders about $2,000 to help start the land fund. &lt;ref name=weekly1213/&gt; The trust still owns the land.

=== Big Sur Coastal Land Use Plan ===
[[Image:Central Californian Coastline, Big Sur - May 2013.jpg|thumb|View south towards McWay Cove in Big Sur]]
The first master plan for the Big Sur coast was written in 1962 by architect and part- time local resident [[Nathaniel Owings]]. The members of the Big Sur Citizens' Advisory Committee, who later founded the trust, met with Big Sur residents and county administrators to draft a new land use plan. The new Big Sur Local Coastal Program was approved after four years of work and several months of public hearings and discussion, including input from the residents of Big Sur. It's one of the most restrictive in the state because of efforts to conserve scenic views and the unparalleled beauty of the area. &lt;ref name=barnewtt031981&gt;{{cite journal |work=Big Sur Gazette | title=Big Sur LCP Adopted by County Planners |

It remains the primary document used to determine what kind of development is allowed. The plan states: "The overall direction for the future of the Big Sur Coast is based around the theme of preserving the outstanding natural environment....The County's basic policy is to prohibit all future public or private development visible from Highway 1". &lt;ref name="walton2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anderson1218"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Mark C.|title=The Big Sur Land Trust revisits its mission|url=http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/cover/the-big-sur-land-trust-revisits-its-mission/article_f174f148-0549-5f9f-8adf-1b957e4846f2.html|newspaper=[[Monterey County Weekly]]|accessdate=October 4, 2016|date=December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=countylcp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coastal.ca.gov/recap/mco-lcp-review.html |title=Draft Findings of the Monterey County LCP Periodic Review |accessdate= August 20, 2016 |date=December 22, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financing ==

The trust is supported through memberships fees, private donations, and public conservation funding.&lt;ref name=bsltabout/&gt; Some of its funding comes from California Proposition 70. It generated $776 million in funding for parks, wildlife, and coast conservation. The trust contributed $300,000 to help pass the proposition, one of the largest donations to the effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Craft|first1=Cynthia H.|title=Land Firms Give Green to Parks Initiative|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-30/news/mn-63913_1_regional-park|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016|date=May 30, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the individuals and groups active in the Big Sur land use planning project lent their support to the campaign in support of Proposition 70. County Supervisor Karin Strasser Kauffman, a strong supporter of conservation efforts, supported the effort and the trust. The trust distributed petitions across the state. The initiative passed by a wide margin of 65 percent in June 1988. Proposition 70 funds are distributed to and allocated by county governments.&lt;ref name="walton2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newman|first1=Morris|title=Focus: Big Sur, Calif.; An Environmentally Correct Resort Hotel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/28/realestate/focus-big-sur-calif-an-environmentally-correct-resort-hotel.html|accessdate=November 29, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 28, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also receives specialized grants, including a grant in 2016 for the Carmel River Floodplain Restoration and Environmental Enhancement project&lt;ref name=bsltriver&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigsurlandtrust.org/newsletter-carmel-river-free-28.htm |title=Freeing the river to use its floodplain}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Carr Lake Project.&lt;ref name=scc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scc.ca.gov/2016/01/19/coastal-conservancy-moves-forward-with-ecosystem-funding/ |title=Coastal Conservancy Funding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the reporting period ending in June 2016, the trust had revenue of $6,088,077, income totaling $6,533,045, and assets of $35,452,353. The assets included land worth $19,973,147 and an endowment totaling $6,934,068.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citizenaudit.org/organization/942473415/BIG%20SUR%20LAND%20TRUST/ |title=Big Sur Land Trust| publisher=CitizenAudit.org |accessdate=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It paid its officers a total of $278,759 in compensation and spent $112,000 for lobbying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Form 990 for 2014|url=http://pdfs.citizenaudit.org/2016_08_EO/94-2473415_990_201506.pdf|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partnerships ===

As property values continue to rise in California's Central Coast, the trust has partnered with Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District, The Nature Conservancy, and the California Natural Resources Agency in land acquisition and conservation projects.&lt;ref name=bsltabout/&gt;

=== Pioneer conservation buyer method ===

In 1989, Zad Leavy, a founder of the trust and long-time attorney, conceived of the idea of inducing landowners to sell property through a process later called the "conservation buyer method". It allows a landowner who permanently gives up their developmental rights to the non-profit trust to deduct from their income taxes the difference between the fair market value before the restrictions are in place with the value afterward. The sellers receive a substantial one-time tax reduction, and the new buyers continually benefit permanently from the lowered property taxes.&lt;ref name=walton2007/&gt;

== Controversial deals ==

Some opponents have criticized the actions of conservation groups like the trust as having "turned the buyout of Big Sur into a business, making millions of dollars buying private land and selling it to government agencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://farrsbill.weebly.com/|title=Help protect communities near the Los Padres National Forest|website=Help protect communities near the Los Padres National Forest|language=en|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gamboa Ranch ===
[[Image:Landels Hill Big Creek Reserve.jpg |thumb|left|Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve ocean view]]
In its second land deal in 1979, the trust edged out buyers from Oklahoma for {{convert|3040|acre|ha|0}} of land known as the Gamboa Ranch near Lucia, California. The owners of the land, 19 New York lawyers, had foreclosed on the $1 million mortgage in 1971 and in early 1979 were seeking to sell the land. Potential buyers from Oklahoma consulted with California Coastal Commissioner Zad Leavy about allowed usage for the land. After receiving his input, they were confident enough about their plan for a retreat-like development to skip a planned 60-day [[escrow]] and made a $1.6 million offer to buy the land from the New York attorneys, which they verbally accepted.

A few days later Commissioner Leavy, without informing the Oklahoma purchasers, switched roles. Acting in his capacity as the attorney for the Big Sur Land Trust, he interrupted the attorneys' meeting during which they were planning to conclude the sale. Leavy offered them $1.2 million in cash and $800,000 in tax credits, the difference between the land's market value and selling price. The tax credit almost completely offset their capital-gains tax payments on the sale.&lt;ref name=weekly1213/&gt;

The six Oklahoma buyers, who had meanwhile flown to California to tour the property for a second time, were "flabbergasted" to learn their agreement had been turned down for a deal that Coastal Commissioner Leavy had arranged acting as attorney for the trust. They were completely unaware that he was acting in any other capacity than as a public official.&lt;ref name=gazette0813/&gt;

[[File:Big Creek Canyon and ocean.jpg|thumb|Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve in Big Sur, California, owned by the University of California]]

At the same time the trust was negotiating with the attorneys, they also brought in the father-in-law of board member Nancy Hopkins, Hewlett-Packard co-founder [[David Packard]]. The entire deal was consummated in less than 48 hours.&lt;ref name=news2008/&gt; In a complicated legal strategy known as a double-escrow, the trust bought the land, and during the few minutes they owned the land, they applied a highly restrictive conservation easement on the property. The easement significantly reduced the property's value. Packard wanted a piece of open coastal land and was happy with the covenants and restrictions, but he was initially concerned that the proposed contract wasn't legal. He asked Executive Director Zad Leavy to confirm that it was permitted by law.&lt;ref name=weekly1213/&gt;

Once Packard was reassured, the trust almost instantly sold him {{convert|1500|acre|ha|0}}. The trust paid the lawyers $1.125 million,&lt;ref name=weekly1213/&gt; and the lawyers also received a $900,000 charitable donation that offset their [[capital gains]] in exchange for the loss they took in selling the land to the trust.&lt;ref name=walton2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=brewer/&gt; Referring to the Oklahoma investors, Leavy commented afterward that "We just barely sneaked under the radar, we just barely beat them".&lt;ref name=news2008&gt;{{cite web|title=Fall-Winter 2008-2009 Big Sur Land Trust Newsletter|url=http://documentslide.com/documents/fall-winter-2008-2009-big-sur-land-trust-newsletter.html|website=documentslide.com|publisher=Big Sur Land Trust|accessdate=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trust sold the other half of the land to the [[University of California]] who established the [[Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve]].&lt;ref name=brewer/&gt;{{rp|282}} Due to a revised exclusion to the real estate listing required by the trust, the realtor who had marketed the property and paid over $6,000 for a full-color brochure among other expenses was not reimbursed.&lt;ref name=gazette0813&gt;{{cite web|title=Zad Leavy: Man of Many Hats|url=http://www.bigsurgazette.com/issues/013_August_13-September_10_1979.pdf|publisher=Big Sur Gazette|accessdate=October 24, 2016|date=September 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Big Sur Gazette'' and the local Coast Property Owners Association charged that Leavy had engaged in a conflict of interest by not revealing both his roles as both a Coastal Commission member and the trust's legal adviser. It charged the trust with engaging in deceptive practices. The trust responded that it only works with willing sellers, who choose to place easements on their property which they retained.&lt;ref name=walton2007/&gt;{{rp|58}}

=== Odello East and Cañada Woods ===

[[Clint Eastwood]] bought six parcels totalling {{convert|650|acre|ha|0}} along Highway 1 near Malpaso Creek, south of the Carmel Highlands, during the 1960s. In 1995, Monterey County bought the land from him for $3.08 million, despite the fact that in July 1994 the county assessor showed the land's assessed value as only $308,682. The county put a permanent conservation easement on the Malpaso property.&lt;ref name=weekly0129/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rancho Cañada Village|url=http://www.pineconearchive.com/ranchocanada.pdf|newspaper=Carmel Pine Cone|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the proceeds from the sale, Eastwood bought the {{convert|134|acre|ha|0}} Odello Ranch at the mouth of the Carmel River during the same year. The ranch had been used for several decades as farm land, most recently to produce artichokes. The purchase price included a county-approved subdivision map for 76 lots and the legal right to {{convert|196|acre ft}} of Carmel River water. When he bought the property, Eastwood paid to lower the levees along the southern side of the Carmel River.  This helped to protect the Mission Ranch resort he owned, along with the neighboring Mission Fields residential neighborhood on the north side of the river, both of which were flooded in 1994.&lt;ref name=weekly0129/&gt;

{{quote|"It{{'}}s a complex situation, this whole matter of property rights versus community rights," says former Ventana Chapter Sierra Club vice chair Don Gruber, "but the so-called gift package Clint bestowed on the public is questionable at best. A gift is something you give away, but [Eastwood] extracted a lot of value from the property. It's been a chain of dubious events I believe needs to be looked at closely."&lt;ref name=weekly0129/&gt;}}

In December 1995, Eastwood sought to exercise his right to appropriate the water rights linked to the Odello property from the State Water Resources Control Board. Eastwood and his representatives said during a public hearing on his request that the appropriation was needed to establish the fair market value of the Odello Ranch for tax purposes. He said he might donate the land along with the water rights to the Big Sur Land Trust.&lt;ref name=weekly0129/&gt;

In 1997, Eastwood and his former wife Maggie Johnson (acting as the Eastwood Trust) donated {{convert|49|acre}} of the Odello Ranch property east of Highway 1 to the trust along with the associated water rights.&lt;ref name=weekly0628&gt;{{cite web|title=Clint Eastwood and Margaret Eastwood Trusts Donate 79-acre Odello East Property for Carmel River FREE Project

In a complicated exchange, on June 28, 2016, Eastwood finally donated the remaining Odello East land.&lt;ref name=weekly1207&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coury|first1=Nic|title=Clint Eastwood donates {{convert|79|acre}} of Carmel land to Big Sur Land Trust.|url=http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/blogs/news_blog/clint-eastwood-donates-acres-of-carmel-land-to-big-sur/article_f9070f36-3d8f-11e6-a202-8faefd584838.html|website=Monterey County Weekly|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastwood had meanwhile purchased {{convert|550|acre|ha|0}} known as the Cañada Woods development immediately east of the Odello Ranch. In a proposal that was scaled back from prior plans for the Cañada Woods location, he reduced the number of homes and planned to restore the Rancho Cañada Golf Course to open space. Eastwood got approval from the county to remove nine lots from his Odello property and 10 lots from his Cañada Woods development.&lt;ref name=weekly0129&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/local_news/eastwood-s-odello-donation-helped-the-movie-mogul-and-the/article_3ffc9c65-a248-53b7-8617-6f67ebba1f37.html |title= Eastwood's Odello donation helped the movie mogul and the county | first1=Richard |last1=Pitnick |date=January 29, 1998 |accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"We wanted Odello preserved, no question," says Ben Post, chair of the Ventana Chapter of the Sierra Club, "but let{{'}}s get clear about this, there{{'}}s a lot of stuff going on here that{{'}}s not all simply clean and I really challenge the process."&lt;ref name=weekly0129/&gt;}}

In exchange, Eastwood transferred the development rights for the 19 units to land adjacent to a {{convert|397|acre|ha|0}} parcel known as Cañada Woods East. This parcel had been donated in 1983 by William Cusack to the Big Sur Land Trust and had been set aside as a permanent scenic easement. Eastwood bought the parcel from the trust for $150,000. Although the trust owned the land, the county held the conservation easement, and Leavy characterized the county's decision to lift that easement as part of the Eastwood purchase as "a political decision". Leavy, representing the trust, said that preserving the Odello Ranch property had greater priority over the land donated by Cusack. Critics complained about the precedent of selling land without public comment for development purposes that had been set aside as open space.&lt;ref name=weekly0129/&gt;

The trust received {{convert|49|acre}} of land, the 67 housing permits associated with the land, and legal right to {{convert|28|acre ft}} of water. The Big Sur trust has previously raised a portion of an estimated $25 million to open a causeway under Highway 1 that will allow more unrestricted flow of the Carmel River into the floodplain west of the highway, reducing the likelihood of flooding.&lt;ref name=weekly0129/&gt;

In the same deal, Eastwood donated {{convert|38|acre}} to Monterey County, which will use some of the land for flood control. The California-American Water Co. received {{convert|3|acre}} in the deal that enables them to place two wells that will pump water from the aquifer under Carmel River nearer to the mouth of the Carmel Valley.&lt;ref name=weekly0129/&gt; In an unusual move, the Eastwood Trust agreed to sell {{convert|50|acre ft}} of its 2016 water rights to help offset Cal-Am's existing unlawful diversions from the Carmel River aquifer, and half of that amount in 2017.&lt;ref name=swrcb2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Division Decision 2015-0001|url=http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/applications/division_decisions/2015/DD2015_0001.pdf|publisher=State Water Resources Control Board, California Environmental Protection Agency |date= July 3, 2015 |accessdate=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the State Water Resources Control Board had issued a cease and desist order barring Cal-Am from making water available for new connections. it approved the Odello East diversion.&lt;ref name=swrcb2015/&gt; The  State Water Resources Control Board ruled:

{{quote|This combination of direct offsets to Cal-Am's unlawful diversions and action to address the long-term negative effects of the unlawful diversions on the environment distinguish this project from the general language regarding applying water to growth on the peninsula, and make approval of the project consistent with the public interest.&lt;ref name=swrcb2015/&gt; }}

{{as of|2016}}, the Malpaso property formerly owned by Eastwood and currently owned by the Big Sur trust is off limits to the public and there are no plans to allow public access. To manage the sale of the water, Eastwood formed the Malpaso Water Company, LLC, which was permitted to enter into subscription agreements with new water users. Eastwood's new water company may receive up to $200,000 per acre foot.&lt;ref name=weekly1207/&gt; Under the terms of Eastwood's and Johnson's donation of the Odello property to the Big Sur trust, they received a $6 million tax write-off.&lt;ref name=weekly0129/&gt;

== Land ownership ==

{{as of|2016}}, the trust had acquired a number of parcels that they continue to own. The table below summarizes major trust acquisitions. The trust obtains the property rights and can choose to retain the land in perpetuity or coordinate with another organization to transfer the parcel into a larger conserved area.

== Conservation easements ==

The trust has negotiated a number of agreements covering about {{convert|17000|acre|ha|0}} with private property owners to preserve the land without transferring ownership. In these instances, the property owners agree to give up the right to develop the land and to conserve resources in perpetuity.&lt;ref name=bslteasements&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigsurlandtrust.org/conservation-easements.htm |title=Conservation Easements}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigsurlandtrust.org/frequently-asked-questions.htm  |title= FAQ |accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landowner receives a one-time tax break, the difference between the prior market value and the value after the ability to develop the land is removed. They also receive the benefit of an ongoing reduction in property taxes. The conservation agreement stipulates that the conserved lands are managed based on values and intentions stipulated to by both parties.&lt;ref name=bsltlandscapes/&gt;

== Land transfers ==

Land transfers are instances where the trust purchases property and then sells or donates the land to a third party. When the property is transferred a conservation easement is added to the title requiring the buyer to maintain the land in its undeveloped state. These kinds of transfers usually incorporate the property into a larger park.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The third parties have included private individuals, the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District, the United States Forest Service, and California State Parks and Recreation.

The trust collaborates with state and regional agencies and other conservation partners to preserve larger purchases. The easements help expand wildlife habitat and native plant populations within watersheds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ediblemontereybay.com/our-newsletter-sponsors/bslt-protecting-and-sharing-spectacular-landscapes/|title=BSLT: Protecting and Sharing Spectacular Landscapes {{!}} Monterey Bay|website=ediblemontereybay.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other projects ==

The trust works on a number of projects in the Monterey County region. Projects focus on the expansion of preserved natural habitat for unique central coast species, and increasing the opportunities available for community members to connect with the environment.

=== Carmel River Parkway ===

Starting in 2004, the Big Sur Land Trust began efforts to collaborate with other agencies and the local community to protect and restore the Carmel River.&lt;ref name="ksbw84"/&gt; They developed a conservation plan to restore and enhance the Carmel River ecosystem. One of the major components is a recreational trail that will connect the lower Carmel Valley to upper reaches of the watershed.&lt;ref name=scribd2007/&gt; About 20 agencies and organizations and more than 200 residents contributed to the planning.&lt;ref name=yubanews/&gt; Known as the Carmel River Parkway Vision Plan, it includes integrated plans for trails, park lands, restored natural areas, and public informational sites in the Carmel River watershed.&lt;ref name="alberola"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ksbw84"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Carmel Valley Hiking Trail Opens To Public|url=http://www.ksbw.com/article/new-carmel-valley-hiking-trail-opens-to-public/1016718|publisher=KSBW.com|accessdate=October 4, 2016|date=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; The South Bank Trail

The trust received a $1.2 million grant from the California Resources Agency River Parkways Program to build a {{convert|1.5|mile}} long handicapped accessible pedestrian and bicycle path that connected the Quail Lodge resort in Carmel Valley to Palo Corona Regional Park. Monterey County secured a grant to design the trail, and the trust received private donations to acquire an easement from private landowners to build the trail. It was completed in October 2011.&lt;ref name=yubanews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yubanet.com/california/Big-Sur-Land-Trust-Opens-New-Public-Trail-in-Carmel-Valley.php|title=Yuba News|access-date=August 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020221922/http://yubanet.com/california/Big-Sur-Land-Trust-Opens-New-Public-Trail-in-Carmel-Valley.php|archive-date=October 20, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Carmel River floodplain restoration

The Carmel River Floodplain Restoration and Environmental Enhancement Project is a plan to restore the natural hydrology of the Carmel River near the Carmel Lagoon and minimize flood risk. When the project is completed, it's expected to:&lt;ref name=carmelriver&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigsurlandtrust.org/blog/carmel-river-free-37.htm |title=Big Sur Land Trust Carmel River}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Improve habitat for [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]].
* Increase connectivity between the river channel, floodplain, and lagoon.
* Restore native riparian and grassland habitat.
* Reduce flood risk for businesses and residences in Lower Carmel Valley.

=== Lobos-Corona Parklands Project ===

In 2017, the trust signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] with California State Parks, Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District, and the Point Lobos Foundation committing to work together to open up the connected properties to the public. The Allen Ranch at the center of the properties is key to the plan, as it makes it possible to add parking that has otherwise been impossible to build due to right-of-way issues.{{asof|2018}}, Point Lobos has only 150 on-site parking spaces. Visitors must park on the shoulder of Highway 1 and often cross it to enter Point Lobos.&lt;ref name="guara"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guara|first1=Maria|title=Point Lobos' natural beauty belies industrial past|url=https://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/Point-Lobos-natural-beauty-belies-industrial-past-4812832.php|accessdate=10 May 2018|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mou"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rubin|first1=Sara|title=Massive parks connectivity plan to create trails network from Carmel to Big Sur announced.|url=http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/blogs/news_blog/massive-parks-connectivity-plan-to-create-trails-network-from-carmel/article_2e47c384-c02e-11e3-b046-001a4bcf6878.html|website=Monterey County Weekly|accessdate=11 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ - Palo Corona Regional Park|url=http://palocorona.org/faq/|website=Palo Corona Regional Park|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lobos-Corona Parklands Project is a collaboration between the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District, the Big Sur Land Trust, California State Parks, and the Point Lobos Foundation. The trust was a leader in a number of components of the Lobos-Corona project including developing the Carmel River Parkway Project and the South Bank Trail. The organization has also contributed to land acquisition and development at Palo Corona Regional Park.&lt;ref name=lobos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigsurlandtrust.org/userfiles/file/Lobos-Corona-Parklands-Project-Vision.pdf |title= Lobos-Corona Vision Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Sur Land Trust purchased the former A.M. Allen Ranch from the Whisler and Wilson Family Trusts in 2003 for $4.25 million and sold the property to the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District in 2013 for $4 million. The property spans the east side of Highway 1 from Carmel to Pt. Lobos and connects Palo Corona Regional Park to Point Lobos Ranch.&lt;ref name=whisler/&gt; In collaboration with the Monterey Regional Park District, the trust developed the {{convert|4.5|mile}} Hatton Canyon recreational trail that connects the top of Carmel Hill to the lower Camel River Trail System at Carmel Valley Road.&lt;ref name=scribd2007/&gt; The trust also helped establish a visitor access and land management plan to address land management issues, including:&lt;ref name=scribd2007/&gt;

* Habitat monitoring for special status animals on the Central Coast including the [[California red-legged frog]] and [[California tiger salamander]].
* Maintenance of healthy grasslands and control of invasive plant species.
* Protection of biologically diverse habitats.

=== Carr Lake Multi-Use Park ===

In 2016, the trust received a grant from the California Coastal Conservancy to acquire Carr Lake, a {{convert|500|acre|ha|0}} undeveloped space in the center of [[Salinas, California]]. The low-lying land has been largely used as farmland. Runoff from the farming operations flows northeast through a reclamation ditch toward Tembladero Slough and into the old Salinas River, and eventually into the [[Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary]]. Sediments that have accumulated in the ditch increase flood risk to nearby homes. The trust is working with city of Salinas to re-purpose the land and create a multi-use community park.&lt;ref name=scc/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcwra&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcwra.co.monterey.ca.us/reclaimation_ditch/reclaimation_ditch.php |title=Reclamation Ditch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trust acquired {{convert|73|acres}} on January 25, 2017 from Ikeda Farms Partnership for $3.95 million. The land is to remain in use for agriculture purposes for several years while the trust works with community organizations and develops a plan for the land. The purchase was funded by California State Coastal Conservancy, the California Natural Resources Agency River Parkways Program, David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Monterey Peninsula Foundation and the Barnet Segal Charitable Trust.&lt;ref name=herrerra&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herrerra|first1=James|title=Big Sur Land Trust acquires 73 acres of Carr Lake Basin in heart of Salinas|url=http://www.montereyherald.com/environment-and-nature/20170125/big-sur-land-trust-acquires-73-acres-of-carr-lake-basin-in-heart-of-salinas|accessdate=26 January 2017|work=Monterey County Herald|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre d'Art Contemporain Genève''' ('''Centre''') is a [[contemporary art]] exhibition centre (a ''[[Kunsthalle]]'') in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], founded by [[Adelina von Fürstenberg]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="saatchi"&gt;[http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/dealers_galleries/Gallery/Centre+d%27Art+Contemporain+Geneve/16393.html Centre D’Art Contemporain Genève], [[Saatchi Gallery]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre was the first contemporary art institution in [[Suisse Romande]] (i.e. in French speaking Switzerland).&lt;ref name="saatchi" /&gt; As a ''Kunsthalle'', it does not have a collection, but organizes temporary exhibitions and projects with regional and international artists.

The Centre d'Art Contemporain Genève gained international renown with exhibitions by artists such as [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Martin Boyce]], [[Olaf Breuning]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Roberto Cuoghi]], [[Gilbert &amp; George]], [[Nan Goldin]], [[Dan Graham]], [[Joan Jonas]], [[On Kawara]], [[William Kentridge]], Robert Overby, [[Pipilotti Rist]], [[Ugo Rondinone]], [[Sterling Ruby]], [[Thomas Scheibitz]], [[Shirana Shahbazi]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Josh Smith (artist)|Josh Smith]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Christopher Wool]].

In 2010, the Centre took on the mission of the [[Centre pour l’Image Contemporaine]] (CIC), established in Geneva in 1985.&lt;ref name="cic"&gt;[http://www.centreimage.ch/cic.php The Centre for Contemporary Image] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206121032/http://www.centreimage.ch/cic.php# |date=2010-12-06 }}, Centre pour l’Image Contemporaine, Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;
CIC was established to organize events and exhibitions of images using new technologies such as video, multimedia, and the Internet, as well as more traditional photography and film ([[Biennale of Moving Images|Biennale de l'Image en Mouvement]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2160">The '''Council for Maintaining the Occupations''' ({{lang-fr|Conseil pour le Maintien des Occupations}}), or '''CMDO''', was a revolutionary committee formed during the [[May 1968 events in France]] originating in the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].&lt;ref name="Vienet1968TheCouncil"&gt;René Viénet (1968) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/enrages08.html The "Council for Maintaining the Occupations" and Councilist Tendencies]''. Enragés and Situationists in the Occupations Movement (Paris, May 1968). Translated by Loren Goldner and Paul Sieveking.&lt;/ref&gt; The council favored the continuation of [[wildcat strike|wildcat]] [[general strike]]s and [[factories occupation|factory occupations]] across France, maintaining them through [[direct democracy|directly democratic]] [[workers' councils]].&lt;ref name="Vienet1968TheCouncil"/&gt; Within the revolutionary movement, it opposed the influence of major [[trade unions]] and the [[French Communist Party]] who intended to contain the revolt and compromise with General [[Charles de Gaulle]].&lt;ref name="Debord1969TheBeginning"&gt;Guy Debord, Mustapha Khayati, René Riesel, Christian Sébastiani, Raoul Vaneigem, René Viénet (1969) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/beginning.html The Beginning of an Era]''. Internationale Situationniste #12 (Paris, September 1969).Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt;

The council implemented a policy of equal representation for its participants. It was described by [[Situationist International|Situationist]] [[René Viénet]] as "essentially an uninterrupted general assembly, deliberating day and night. No faction or private meetings ever existed outside the common debate." It was formed on the evening of May 17, by supporters of the [[Occupation Committee of the Sorbonne|Sorbonne Occupation Committee]].&lt;ref name="Vienet1968TheCouncil"/&gt;

'''''Crash''''' is a 2004 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] produced, directed, and co-written by [[Paul Haggis]]. The film features racial and social tensions in [[Los Angeles]]. A self-described "passion piece" for Haggis, ''Crash'' was inspired by a real-life incident, in which his [[Porsche]] was [[Carjacking|carjacked]] in 1991 outside a video store on [[Wilshire Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;''Crash'' DVD Commentary Track. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several characters' stories interweave during two days in Los Angeles: a black detective estranged from his mother; his criminal younger brother and gang associate; the white [[district attorney]] and his irritated, pampered wife; a racist white police officer who disgusts his more idealistic younger partner; an African-American [[Hollywood]] director whose wife must deal with the racist officer; a [[Iranian citizens abroad|Persian]]-immigrant father who is wary of others; and a hard-working [[Hispanic]] locksmith family man.

The film deals with racism in a rather impartial approach; rather than separating the characters into victims and offenders, victims of racism are often shown to be prejudiced themselves in different contexts and situations; racist remarks and actions are often shown to stem from ignorance and misconception rather than malice.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Matt Dillon]], [[Jennifer Esposito]], [[William Fichtner]],  [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Terrence Howard]], [[Ludacris|Chris "Ludacris" Bridges]], [[Thandie Newton]], [[Michael Peña]], and [[Ryan Phillippe]]. Matt Dillon was particularly praised for his performance and received Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, the cast won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]]. The film received six [[Academy Award]] nominations, and won three for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]]. It was also nominated for nine BAFTA awards, and won two, for Best Original Screenplay and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actress]] for Thandie Newton.

==Plot==
{{long plot|date=July 2016}}
Detective Graham Waters has suffered a car accident with his partner Ria. He mentions that the citizens of Los Angeles have lost their "sense of touch." Ria and the driver of the other car, Kim Lee, exchange racially charged insults. When Waters exits the car, he arrives at a police investigation crime scene concerning the discovery of a "dead kid." While purchasing a revolver at a gun store, Farhad, a Persian shop owner, and his daughter Dorri, argue over what box of bullets they should buy. The gun store owner grows impatient and degrades the two of them by referring to Farhad as "[[Osama bin Laden|Osama]]." Farhad asserts that he is an American citizen, but the store owner continues insulting Farhad and has the security guard escort him out of the store. Faced with a choice, the store owner gives the gun to Dorri who then leaves with a specific box of bullets. Two black men Anthony and Peter carjack a married couple named Rick, a district attorney, and Jean Cabot as they are about to enter their SUV. At the Cabot house, Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz changes their locks and leaves the keys on the kitchen counter when Jean notices his tattoos.

Waters and Ria arrive at the scene of a shooting between two drivers, both of whom are undercover police officers consisting of one who survived and the other who is dead. LAPD officer John Ryan calls an [[HMO]] on behalf of his father and has a racially charged argument with a representative named Shaniqua Johnson. Ryan and his partner Tom Hansen pull over the vehicle similar to the one carjacked earlier, despite discrepancies in the descriptions, and order the couple, director Cameron Thayer and his wife Christine, to exit. Cameron is cooperative, but Christine is argumentative. Ryan then sexually assaults her under the auspices of a pat-down, humiliating her and her husband before releasing them. Arriving home from work, Daniel gives his young daughter Lara an "invisible impenetrable cloak," which makes her feel safe enough to fall asleep in her bed.

In the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit a Korean man while passing a parked van, dump him in front of a hospital, and drive away. Hansen talks to his superior Lt. Dixon about switching partners, but Dixon denies that. Ryan visits Shaniqua and apologizes for the argument, but Shaniqua nearly calls security to escort Ryan out of her office. Daniel replaces a lock at Farhad's shop, but is accused of cheating by Farhad. He discovers the store has been wrecked and defaced with graffiti, causing it to face closure and Farhad to vow revenge on Daniel. Waters visits his hard drug-abusing mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother.

Ryan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine trapped. With the help of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. Anthony and Peter approach another navigator which happens to be Cameron's. They only see Cameron driving after they open the door and are shocked to see that the driver is black. Anthony tells Peter to shoot Cameron, but Peter does not. As police officers arrive, Cameron and Anthony both race for the car and jump in. Cameron drives away, with Anthony continuing to point a gun at him. Cameron drives into a dead end, puts Anthony's gun into his pocket, and exits the car, all the while yelling insults at the officers. Hansen vouches for Cameron, fending off the other officers, and promising to give him a "harsh" warning.

Farhad locates Daniel's house and waits in ambush. As he confronts Daniel with his gun in hand, Lara jumps into Daniel's arms, attempting to protect her father with the "invisible cloak." Daniel's wife Elizabeth runs out the front door and watches in horror as Farhad shoots Lara. Daniel clutches his daughter as Fahrad stands shocked as both realized she has not been hit by any bullet. Daniel runs into the house with his wife and daughter, leaving Fahrad outside. Farhad later tells his daughter that he believes the little girl was his guardian angel, preventing him from committing a terrible crime. Dorri is then shown with the box of bullets she had purchased, labeled as [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]].

Hansen pulls over to pick up a hitchhiking Peter. As the two converse, it is clear that Hansen does not trust Peter. Peter begins to laugh suddenly, offending Hansen and causing him to pull over. As Peter attempts to explain why he is laughing, Hansen believes he is pulling out a gun and mistakenly shoots and kills Peter. In his hand is a statuette similar to the one on Hansen's dash. Horrified, Hansen hides the body in the bushes and burns his car. Waters arrives at the scene with his partner and the connection is made that Peter is his missing brother. His mother collapses upon seeing his body at the morgue, and Dorri is revealed to be the coroner. When Waters promises to find who is responsible, his mother tells him that it was his fault for not finding his younger brother.

Anthony decides to steal the van of the Korean man he accidentally hit, and drops it off at a chop shop he frequents, only to discover a number of Cambodian immigrants locked in the back of the van, revealing that the Korean man was involved in [[human trafficking]]. The chop shop owner offers him $500 per immigrant. While resting in her bed after falling down the stairs, Jean hugs Maria, saying she is the only true friend she has ever had and apologizes. Anthony is seen driving into [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] and sets the Cambodian people free, passing a car crash on his way out which turns out to involve Shaniqua.

==Release==

===Box office===
''Crash'' opened in [[wide release]] on May 6, 2005, and was a box office success in the late spring of 2005. The film had a budget of $6.5 million (plus $1 million in financing).&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt; Because of the financial constraints, director Haggis filmed in his own house, borrowed a set from the TV show ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', used his car in parts of the film, and even used cars from other staff members.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The film grossed $53.4 million domestically, making back more than seven times its budget.&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt; Despite its success in relation to its cost, ''Crash'' was the lowest-grossing film at the domestic box office to win [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] since ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' in 1987.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Critical response===
{{Expand section|date=June 2017}}
On review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 236 reviews, with an average score of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "A raw and unsettling morality piece on modern angst and urban disconnect, ''Crash'' examines the dangers of bigotry and xenophobia in the lives of interconnected Angelenos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1144992-crash |title=''Crash'' (2004) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 69 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/crash?q=Crash |title=''Crash'' Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[CinemaScore]], audiences gave the film a grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemascore.com/ |title=Crash |publisher=CinemaScore |accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 4/4 stars and described it as "a movie of intense fascination",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ebert, Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050505/REVIEWS/50502001/1023 |title=Crash |work=Chicago Sun-Times |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=May 5, 2005 |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; listing it as the best film of 2005. The film also ranks at #460 in ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s 2008 poll of the "500 Greatest Films of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/8.asp |title=Empire Features |work=EmpireOnline.com |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some later reviews of ''Crash'' have been less favorable. Cultural critic [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]] criticized the film as shallow and "unthinking," naming ''Crash'' "the worst film of the decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2009/12/worst-movie-of-the-decade/32759 |title=Worst Movie of the Decade |work=TheAtlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has been critiqued for depicting the Persian shopkeeper as a "deranged, paranoid individual who is only redeemed by what he believes is a mystical act of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darkmatter101.org/site/2007/05/07/crash-and-the-city |title=Crash and the City |work=DarkMatter101.org |date=May 7, 2007 |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has also been criticized for using multicultural and sentimentalist imagery to cover over material and "historically sedimented inequalities" that continue to affect different racial groups in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filmcriticism.allegheny.edu/archives31_2.htm |title=Film Criticism Current Issue |work=FilmCriticism.Allegheny.edu |accessdate=April 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425142459/http://filmcriticism.allegheny.edu/archives31_2.htm |archivedate=April 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance]] selected ''Crash'' as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = IFTA Picks 30 Most Significant Indie Films | url = http://www.thewrap.com/ifta-picks-30-most-significant-indie-films-20686/ | work=The Wrap| accessdate=January 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oscar controversy===
''Crash'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] Oscar at the [[78th Academy Awards]], controversially beating the critically favored ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' and making it only the second film ever (the other being ''[[The Sting]]'') to win the Academy Award for Best Picture without having been nominated for any of the three Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture (Best Drama, Best Comedy/Musical and Best Foreign Film).

The film's use of moral quandary as a storytelling medium was widely reported as ironic, since many saw it as the "safe" alternative to ''Brokeback Mountain'', the plot of which focused on gay cowboys. Critic [[Kenneth Turan]] suggested that ''Crash'' benefited from anti-gay discomfort among Academy members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/oscars/env-turan5mar05,0,5359042.story |last=Turan |first=Kenneth |title=Breaking no ground: Why 'Crash' won, why 'Brokeback' lost and how the Academy chose to play it safe |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=March 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2009/04/maybe-crashs-upset-at-the-oscars-shouldnt-have-been-such-a-surprise.html |title=Maybe Crash's upset at the Oscars shouldn't have been such a surprise? |date=April 16, 2009 |work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; while critic [[Roger Ebert]] was of a different opinion, arguing that the better film won that year. Ebert also questioned why many critics were not acknowledging the other nominees, claiming that they were criticizing ''Crash'''s win solely because it won over their preferred film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=March 6, 2006 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060306/OSCARS/603070301 |work= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |title=The fury of the 'Crash'-lash |accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Film Comment]]'' magazine placed ''Crash'' first on their list of "Worst Winners of Best Picture Oscars", followed by ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' at #2, and ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' at #3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/extended-trivial-top-20 |title=Extended Trivial Top 20® |date=March–April 2012 |accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2014 survey of film critics by ''[[The Atlantic]]'' identified the film's victory as among the most glaring mistakes made by the Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;Roumell, Graham, "What was the biggest Oscar mistake ever made?" https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/03/what-was-the-biggest-oscar-mistake-ever-made/357581/ March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' polled hundreds of Academy members, asking them to re-vote on past controversial decisions. For the 2006 Best Picture winner, ''Brokeback Mountain'' beat ''Crash'' and the other nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/19/academy-members-reassess-past-oscar-decisions-crash-brokeback-mountain |title=Crash Burned: Academy Members Reassess Past Oscar Decisions |date=February 19, 2015 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 interview, [[Paul Haggis]] commented : "Was [''Crash''] the best film of the year? I don't think so. There were great films that year. ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'' – amazing film. ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'' – terrific film. Ang Lee's ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', great film. And Spielberg's ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]''. I mean please, what a year. ''Crash'', for some reason, affected people, it touched people. And you can't judge these films like that. I'm very glad to have those Oscars. They're lovely things. But you shouldn't ask me what the best film of the year was because I wouldn't be voting for ''Crash'', only because I saw the artistry that was in the other films. Now however, for some reason that's the film that touched people the most that year. So I guess that's what they voted for, something that really touched them. And I'm very proud of the fact that ''Crash'' does touch you. People still come up to me more than any of my films and say: 'That film just changed my life.' I've heard that dozens and dozens and dozens of times. So it did its job there. I mean, I knew it was the social experiment that I wanted, so I think it's a really good social experiment. Is it a great film? I don't know".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Child|first=Ben|title=Paul Haggis: Crash didn't deserve best picture Oscar|date=12 August 2015|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/12/paul-haggis-crash-best-picture-oscar|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Egyptian revival decorative arts''' is a style in Western art, mainly of the early nineteenth century, in which Egyptian motifs were applied to a wide variety of [[decorative arts]] objects.

[[File:Sevres Egyptian Service.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The "Egyptian" service of Sèvres porcelain, designed by [[Dominique Vivant]] and given by Napoleon to Czar Alexander I in 1807, on display in the [[Kuskovo|Kuskovo Palace]].]]

Enthusiasm for the artistic style of Ancient Egypt is generally attributed to the excitement over Napoleon's conquest of Egypt and, in Britain, to Admiral Nelson's defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Napoleon took a scientific expedition with him to Egypt. Publication of the expedition's work, the ''Description de l'Égypte'', began in 1809 and came out in a series though 1826, inspiring everything from sofas with Sphinxes for legs, to tea sets painted with the pyramids. It was the popularity of the style that was new, Egyptianizing works of art had appeared in scattered European settings from the time of the Renaissance.

The Egyptian Gallery, a private room in the [[Duchess Street, London|Duchess Street]] home of connoisseur [[Thomas Hope (1769-1831)|Thomas Hope]] to display his Egyptian antiquities, and illustrated in engravings from his meticulous line drawings in his book,''Household Furniture and Interior Decoration'' (1807), were a prime source for the [[Regency style]] in British furnishings. The book inspired a generation of fashionable English homeowners to install parlor suites featuring chairs, tables and sofas in shapes that evoked the objects depicted on Egyptian tomb paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgc.bard.edu/object_month/090908/oom_090908_column.shtml Thomas Hope: Regency Designer, A Curatorial Interpretation of the Egyptian Room at Duchess Street]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/arts/design/11anti.html When London and Paris Looked to the Nile for Inspiration, Wendy Moonan, July 11, 2008, New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later discoveries prompted small further revivals.

The '''''Fano Altarpiece''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Pietro Perugino]], executed in 1497, and housed in the church of  Santa Maria Nuova, [[Fano]], central Italy. It also includes a [[lunette]] with a ''Pietà'' and several [[predella]] panels.

Perugino had already painted an ''[[Annunciation (Perugino, Fano)|Annunciation]]'' in 1488-1490. Several scholars have supposed that a young [[Raphael]] collaborated on the predella.
[[File:Pietro Perugino cat45a.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Lunette.]]

==Description==
The Madonna is portrayed on a luminous landscape of hills, on a high throne; in front of her is a pedestal with, on it, a mystic vase, and featuring the signature and date, which were always added by Perugino when the painting was produced in his workshop and then shipped to the destination. Mary holds the Child in the same fashion of the [[Decemviri Altarpiece]] of 1495-1496.

At the sides are the saints John the Baptist (with a camel skin and a stick with the cross), [[St. Louis of Toulouse|Louis of Toulouse]], who wears a bishop dress, Francis of Assisi (reading), Peter with the Keys of Heaven, Paul (with a long beard and a red vest) and Mary Magdalene with offerings to the Madonna. The portico is a typical element of Perugino's paintings of the period, such as the [[Albani Torlonia Polyptych]]; also typical of his late works is the Madonna's figure as a more mature woman, different than the elegantly youthful portrayal painted before. Less usual are the differentiated proportions of the saints and of the Madonna herself.

The lunette depicts Jesus raised from his sepulchre  by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and Nicodemus, with Mary and John the Apostle at the sides. The predella includes the scenes of the ''Nativity of Mary'', the ''Presentation of Jesus at the Temple'', the ''Marriage of the Virgin'', the ''Annunciation'' and the ''Assumption''. In these secondary paintings Perugino used some of his typical themes, including the portico and the oval in a valley.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1487">A '''film sculptor''' is employed within the [[art department]] of a [[feature film]].

Their skills are and can be used to create any number of different things from giant rocks in a landscape or oversized stone blocks cladding the facade of a castle to statuary and ornate panelling, to more specialized pieces such as a vehicle hull for a [[fantasy]] film used in [[set construction]].  The material often utilised for large-scale rocks or columns is [[polystyrene]] because it is light and can be carved easily using a hot wire.  Polystyrene can also be used to sculpt mid-sized items that are difficult to build in wood and too large for clay - an item such as a moulded chair can then be cast with [[plaster]] and reproduced in [[fibre-glass]]. [[Clay]] modelling is still preferable for any item needing detail and is always used for smaller and finer work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideastap.com/ideasmag/the-knowledge/jonathan-moore-sculptor Film-set sculptor, By Annika Kristensen	20/12/10 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://creativeskillset.org/job_roles_and_stories/job_roles/747_sculptor creativeskillset.org, Sculptor]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Garima Gospels''' are two ancient [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] [[Gospel Book]]s. Garima 2, the earlier of the two, is believed to be the earliest surviving complete [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] Christian manuscript.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/unearthed-the-ancient-texts-that-tell-story-of-christianity-2019188.html|title=Unearthed, the ancient texts that tell story of Christianity|first1=Jerome|last1=Taylor|date=6 July 2010|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/discovery-of-earliest-illuminated.html#st1U6cLh0CFTupQh.97|title=Discovery of earliest illustrated manuscript|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501030359/0http://ethiopianheritagefund.org/artsNewspaper.html|archivedate=May 1, 2012|first1=Martin|last1=Bailey|work=The Art Newspaper|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monastic tradition holds that they were composed at the turn of the sixth century, a date supported by recent [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon analysis]]; samples from Garima 2 proposed a date of {{c.}} 390-570, while counterpart dating of samples from Garima 1 proposed a date of {{c.}} 530-660.&lt;ref name="Bausi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bausi|first1=Alessandro|title=Ethiopia and the Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity: The Garimā Gospels in Context |url=http://www.ethiopianheritagefund.org/document-page-2|publisher=Ethiopian Heritage Fund|accessdate=3 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503173517/http://www.ethiopianheritagefund.org/document-page-2|archivedate=1 May 2017|page=2|format=Summary of conference proceedings|date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the two manuscripts provide the major witness to the Ethiopic version of the [[Gospel]]s and have been applied as proof texts for the creation of critical editions of the Ethiopic Gospels by Rochus Zuurmond ([[Gospel of Mark]], 1989; [[Gospel of Matthew]], 2001) and Michael G Wechsler ([[Gospel of John]], 2005). As such, they represent amongst the earliest versional witnesses to the early [[Byzantine text-type]] of the Gospels, and are the oldest surviving Ethiopian manuscripts of any kind known to modern scholars. Western scholarship had previously believed both gospels to date from {{c.}} 1100 or later on the basis of [[palaeography|palaeographic]] analysis.&lt;ref name=Bausi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Quedlinburg Itala fragment]] is dated to the 420s to 430s.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gospels are housed in [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Abba Garima Monastery]]. They are not known ever to have left the monastery;&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt; although, as the surrounding area was occupied by Muslims from the ninth to the fourteenth centuries, it is possible that they may have remained hidden in a cave for centuries, and then rediscovered.&lt;ref name=Bailey2&gt;[http://www.ethiopianheritagefund.org/ArtsnewsReport_Garima%20Gospels.pdf "Research uncovers lost African school of painting"] Martin Bailey, The Art Newspaper, December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gospels were included in the catalog of an American museum exhibition that toured from 1993–96, ''African Zion: the Sacred Art of Ethiopia'', but were never actually lent to the exhibition.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;

==Tradition==

Monastic tradition ascribes the gospel books to Saint [[Abba Garima]], said to have arrived in Ethiopia in 494.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt; Abba Garima is one of the [[Nine Saints]] traditionally said to have come from '[[Rome]]' (often thought to refer to [[Syria]]), and to have Christianized the rural populations of the ancient Ethiopian kingdom of [[Axum]] in the sixth century; and the monks regard the Gospels less as significant antiquities than as sacred relics of Abba Garima.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt; According to tradition, Abba Garima wrote and illustrated the complete Gospels in a single day: God stopped the sun from setting until the Saint completed his work.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Definitive radiocarbon tests have indeed supported the dating  Abba Garima 2, the earlier of the two books, to the sixth century,&lt;ref name=Bausi/&gt; but otherwise recent research tends to contra-indicate many aspects of the traditional account, proposing instead that the text-base for the Garima gospels is Greek, not Syriac, that the iconography and palaeography look to Egyptian not Syrian sources, and that the gospel translation witnessed in the Garima gospels had been completed over a century before the traditional dates for the Nine Saints. Furthermore, the supposed Syrian origin of the Nine Saints is no longer maintained in most recent scholarship.&lt;ref name=Niccum&gt;Rochus Zuurmond and Curt Niccum, "The Ethiopic Version of the New Testament", in "The Text of the New Testament in Contemporary Research" 2nd edn, Bart D Ehrman and Michael W Holmes eds, Brill, 2013, pp 231-252&lt;/ref&gt;

==The manuscripts==
[[File:Garima Gospels.jpg|thumb|Two pages with illuminated [[Eusebian Canons]] from Garima 1, likely the later of the two Garima Gospels]]
There are two manuscripts, Garima 1 and Garima 2, of which Garima 2 is likely to be the earlier. In older reference works, Garima 1 is designated Garima I, while Garima 2 is designated Garima III. Before recent restoration, a third, probably 14th century, gospel book had been bound with Garima 2, and this later gospel was then denoted Garima II.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Donald M Davies,'The Dating of Ethiopic Manuscripts' in Journal of Near Eastern Studies 46:4, 1987, p 293 .&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent restoration has separated the three books, and repaginated in the original order and volumes; relocating a number of folios and miniatures which over the centuries had been displaced between the three manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Lester Capon, [http://www.hewit.com/skin_deep/?volume=26&amp;article=1#article] "Extreme Bookbinding; A Fascinating Preservation Project in Ethiopia, Skin Deep 46, Autumn 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Garima 1 has 348 surviving pages, opening with eleven illuminated [[canon tables]] in arcades, followed by the Gospel texts in [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]]; the Ethiopic language of the Kingdom of Axum from the 4th to the 7th centuries, which  became and remains the religious language of the Ethiopian Church. Garima 2, also in Ge'ez, is a 322-page folio written by a different scribe. It has seventeen illuminated pages, including four fine [[Evangelist portrait]]s preceding their respective gospels, and a separate portrait of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] preceding his canon tables.&lt;ref name=Bailey2/&gt;  The portraits of Matthew, Luke and John are all presented frontally and scarcely differentiated; but that of Mark presents him in profile on the episcopal throne of [[Alexandria]]. A further illuminated page depicts the [[Temple of Solomon]], or perhaps the [[Fountain of Life]], with a staircase of unusual form unique in  Christian [[iconography]].&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mercier&gt;Jacques Mercier,[http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/121872/garima_conference_oxford.pdf], Flyer for the Oxford Conference, Ethiopian Heritage Fund, November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The miniatures are in a broadly [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] style, and are stylistically consistent with a sixth century date. While the text was certainly written in Ethiopia, some scholars such as Marilyn Heldman, had maintained that the illuminated pages might have been imported ready-made from [[ancient Syria]] or [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]]; whereas Jacques Mercier now argues that both text and illuminations were produced within Ethiopia.&lt;ref name=Bausi/&gt; Some of the illustrations can be seen at [http://www.hewit.com/skin_deep/?volume=26&amp;article=1#article].

The texts of the two manuscripts differ such that Garima 1 does not appear to descend directly from Garima 2, implying that the common translation from which they derive is likely to be substantially earlier still; and that consequently the Ethiopian Gospel translation may be older than previously believed.&lt;ref name=Mercier/&gt;

Neither manuscript has a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]]. However, in Garima II (the 14th century gospel book formerly bound with Garima 2) there is a historical note on two intruded leaves at the end of the [[Gospel of Luke]], referring to the repair of churches undertaken by a King Armeho. Armeho may be identified with the King [[Armah]] of Axum, who issued coins between 600 and 640.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt; Getatchew Haile, in translating the notes of the manuscripts, leaves open the possibility that this note may be attributed to the period of the king's reign.&lt;ref name=Bausi/&gt;

The two front covers are also very old; that of Garima 1 possibly contemporary with the manuscript, which would probably make it the oldest book cover still attached to its book in the world (the 7th century [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] is the oldest European one). It is in gilt-copper with a wooden backing boards and its decoration centres on a large cross. Holes that may have been settings for gems are now empty. The cover for Garima 2 is silver and from the 10th to 12th centuries.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;

A 19th-century church for female [[pilgrim]]s at the edge of the monastery is being renovated to house the precious manuscripts. It has small windows, which will help prevent fading. Steel bars are being inserted and the building will be protected by armed guards.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;

==Expert opinion==

The Garima Gospels first became known outside Ethiopia in 1950, when [[Beatrice Playne]], a  British [[art historian]] visited the monastery. Since women are not allowed inside the monastery, the monks courteously carried several manuscripts outside for her to view. She wrote that, "there were several [[illuminated manuscripts]] whose ornamental headings struck me as Syrian in style."&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Playne, ''St. George for Ethiopia'' (London: Constable, 1954), p. 103. In a footnote, Playne adds that the ornamental headings "closely resembled the canonical headings in the [[Rabbula Gospels|Gospels of Rabula]] ([[Laurentian Library]], Florence)."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s Frenchman [[Jules Leroy]] examined the manuscripts and proposed that they dated from c. 1100.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;  Until recently, few other outside scholars had seen the manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;

The two Garima Gospels became known to bibilical scholars through microfilm photographs collected by Donald M Davies; who realised that they represented a much earlier text than that of any other surviving Ethiopian manuscript. He dated all three Garima gospel books (including Garima II then bound with Garima 2) to the 8th-10th centuries.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt; Following Davies, and using his photographs, the Garima Gospels formed the base text used by Rochus Zuurmond in his preparation of a critical text for the Ethiopic Gospels; choosing Garima 1 as his primary proof text. Garima 1 and Garima 2 form together Zuurmond's class 'Aa' text or ''Versio Antiqua'', which he states as being "a type which might be more or less the original", in that no later Ethiopic manuscript could be envisaged as conveying substantial information about the original translation except in those passages where neither Garima text survives or is readable.  Zuurmond dated all three Garima gospel books later than Davies had done "In my opinion they cannot be safely dated later than the 13th century, but are probably one or two centuries earlier". In categorising the text witnessed in Garima 1 and Garima 2, Zuurmond states that it has the characteristics of a "free translation" retaining idiomatic Ge'ez syntax and grammar; while often betraying a limited expertise in Greek grammar, vocabulary and orthography. Later Ethiopic manuscripts (and following them, all previous printed Ethiopic editions) commonly descend from an extensive revision undertaken in the 13th century, by which the Gospel texts were corrected to convey more literal and accurate renderings of Greek word order and terminology, and also to conform more closely to [[Bible translations into Arabic|Egyptian Arabic]] versions. Stripping away these later changes, Zuurmond classifies the Garima texts as "early Byzantine"; while emphasising that, especially in the Gospel of John, its readings often appear to witness a version of the Byzantine Text that differs from the later [[Majority Text]]; "In about half my sample cases [in John] Eth goes against the Ethiopic equivalent of the Greek Majority Text".&lt;ref&gt;Rochus Zuurmond, "The Ethiopic Version of the New Testament", in "The Text of the New Testament in Contemporary Research", Bart D Ehrman and Michael W Holmes eds, Eeerdmans, 1995, pp 142-156&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Mercier a French expert in [[Ethiopian art]], examined the manuscripts at the monastery; and, because the manuscripts were deteriorating to the point where they crumbled every time they were examined, he was permitted in 2000 to take two small detached fragments of [[parchment]] to the Oxford University Research Laboratory for Archaeology. One sample from an evangelist page in Garima 2 was dated to 330–540; and the other, from a different canon table page but not definitely a different manuscript, to 430–650.&lt;ref name=Bausi2&gt;Alessandro Bausi, [https://www.academia.edu/1231740/The_True_Story_of_the_Abba_Garima_Gospels], "The True Story of the Abba Garima Gospels", Comparative Oriental Manuscript Studies Newsletter, January 2011, pp 17-19&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on stylistic aspects of the work, Mercier then estimated that the two gospels dated from c. 600.&lt;ref name=Bausi2/&gt; This accords with the date proposed by Marilyn Heldman in the catalog to the 1993 Exhibition ''African Zion: the Sacred Art of Ethiopia''.  Marilyn Heldman had previously contributed notes on the illuminated pages of Garima 1 and Garima 2 to Donald Davies's study of dating Ethiopic manuscripts, in which she had argued that the correct depiction of classical architectural forms in the Garima canon tables precluded a date later than the sixth century; while the nearest parallels to the evangelist portraits (especially the forms of furniture depicted in the portrait of Mark) were also of that century.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;

Mercier's proposal of a much earlier date for the Garima Gospels was taken into account in the revision of Zuurmond's work undertaken by Curt Niccum in 2013.  Niccum accepts Mercier's carbon-dating of the Garima Gospels to the sixth century, noting that this is consistent with the observation by Michael Knibb that the text of surviving '[[Kaleb of Axum|Kaleb]]' Ge'ez Gospel inscriptions dating from around 525 conform with the form of text in the Garima Gospels, rather than with that found in later Ethiopic manuscripts and editions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Knibb, "Translating the Bible: The Ethiopic Version of the Old Testament", OUP, 1999, pp 46-54&lt;/ref&gt;  He concludes that "more and more evidence points to a considerably earlier period of translation"; arguing that most of the work of translating the New Testament into [[Ge'ez]] must have been completed in Axum before the end of the fourth century. In particular. Niccum noted the recent identification in surviving manuscripts of an 'Aksumite Collection' of church canons and patristic extracts, whose translation into Ge'ez can be confidently dated to the fifth century; and which presupposes the Gospels in a Ge'ez version.&lt;ref name=Niccum/&gt;

In November 2013, a two-day conference was held at the [[Ioannou Centre for Classical and Byzantine Studies]] at Oxford, sponsored by the [[Ethiopian Heritage Fund]], with the title "Ethiopia and the Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity: The Garima Gospels in Context".&lt;ref name=Bausi/&gt; During restoration work further sample fragments had been collected under controlled conditions from text and illustrated pages of both manuscripts; as a result of which Jacques Mercier was able to report definitive radio-carbon datings of the two Garima Gospels; 390 to 570 for Garima 2, and 530 to 660 for Garima 1.&lt;ref name=Bailey2/&gt; These dating ranges would suggest that the Garima 2 manuscript is highly likely to be earlier than the Syriac illustrated [[Rabbula Gospels]] now in the collection of the Laurentian Library in [[Florence, Italy]] and explicitly dated to 586.&lt;ref name=Bausi/&gt; Mercier proposed the [[Cotton Genesis]], [[Vienna Genesis]] and [[Rossano Gospels]] as comparable (though undated) illuminated manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Bailey2/&gt; Otherwise papers presented at the conference included the first full published translation by Getatchew Haile of the various historical notes found in the two gospel books; together with various iconographic and palaeographic studies, including a paper from Jacques Mercier arguing that the common grid of scored lines underlying both illustrations and text demonstrates that both were executed in Ethiopia, and that consequently a school of painting and a workshop for the production of manuscripts must have been active in the Kingdom of Axum in [[Late Antiquity]].&lt;ref name=Bailey2/&gt; Alessandro Bausi presented a paper comparing the Ge'ez language and palaeography of the Garima gospels with those found in a recently identified manuscript witness to the 'Aksumite Collection' or 'Synod of Qefrya'; an edited compendium of selected Greek synodical texts, which is believed to have been translated into Ge'ez in the later fifth century.&lt;ref name=Bausi/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15894">The following is a '''list of unproduced George Miller projects''' in roughly chronological order. During a career that has spanned over 40 years, [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] has worked on projects which never progressed beyond the [[pre-production]] stage under his direction. A few of the projects were made after he left production.

==1990s==

===''Contact''===
* In 1993, Miller was hired to direct ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' based on the story by [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Ann Druyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Head|first=Tom|url=https://www.amazon.com/Conversations-Sagan-University-Mississippi-Paperback/dp/B00DWWC4HA|title=Conversations with Carl Sagan|date=5 January 2006|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|location=[[Jackson, Mississippi]]|page=89|access-date=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Contact'' commenced pre-production. Miller cast [[Jodie Foster]] in the lead role, approached [[Ralph Fiennes]] to play Palmer Joss and also considered casting [[Linda Hunt]] as the [[President of the United States]]. In addition to having aliens put on a [[laser lighting display]] around Earth, another version of the Goldenberg scripts had an alien wormhole swallow up the planet, transporting Earth to the center of the galaxy. Miller also asked Goldenberg to rewrite ''Contact'' in an attempt to portray the [[Pope]] as a key supporting character. Warner Bros. was hoping to have the film ready for release by Christmas 1996, but under Miller's direction pre-production lasted longer than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Benjamin Svetkey | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,288672,00.html | title = Making Contact | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1997-07-18 | accessdate = 2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio  fired the director, blaming pushed-back start dates, budget concerns, and Miller's insistence that the script needed five more weeks of rewriting after working on the film for over a year. [[Robert Zemeckis]] was eventually brought on to direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chitwood|first1=Adam|title=George Miller Talks His Version of CONTACT; Likens It to INTERSTELLAR|url=http://collider.com/contact-george-miller-reveals-his-version-of-movie-was-like-interstellar/|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000s==

===''Justice League: Mortal''===
* In 2007, Miller signed on to direct a [[Justice League]] film titled ''[[Justice League in other media#Film|Justice League: Mortal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garrett|first1=Diane|title=George Miller to lead ‘Justice League’|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/features/george-miller-to-lead-justice-league-2-1117972369/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month roughly 40 actors and actresses were auditioning for the ensemble superhero roles, among them were [[Joseph Cross (actor)|Joseph Cross]], [[Michael Angarano]], [[Max Thieriot]], [[Minka Kelly]], [[Adrianne Palicki]] and [[Scott Porter]]. Miller intended to cast younger actors as he wanted them to "grow" into their roles over the course of several films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Borys| last = Kit | title = The Vine: Young actors seek ''Justice'' | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/vine-young-actors-seek-justice-152538| date = 2007-10-15 | accessdate = 2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.

==2010s==

===''Happy Feet 3''===
* In a 2011 interview, Miller was asked if he had any plans for ''[[Happy Feet Two#Possible_sequel|Happy Feet Three]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://collider.com/george-miller-happy-feet-2-mad-max-interview/126581/ |title=Director George Miller Talks HAPPY FEET TWO, MAD MAX, and JUSTICE LEAGUE |accessdate=January 21, 2012 |work=collider.com |date=November 16, 2011 |author=Christina Radish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"If you put a gun to my head and said, 'You have to come up with a story for ''Happy Feet 3'',' I’d say shoot me. I would have no idea. I really would have no idea. The stories creep up on you. You just have to allow the stories to come, and then they get in like little ear worms in your head and they won’t go away. If that happens and we’ve got the energy, we’ll do a third one. If it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen. That’s the only way you can do it. It has to be authentic. I really wanted to make this film better than the first one. Otherwise, at my age, what’s the point? You really want to make it better. If something comes up that’s really exciting and I can convey that enthusiasm to other people, then there would be a third one."|George Miller}}

===''Mad Max: Fury Road'' (sequels and spinoffs)===
* In 2011, Miller and McCarthy found during the writing process for ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'' that they had enough story material for two additional scripts. One of these, entitled ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road#Sequels|Mad Max: Furiosa]]'', had already been completed, and Miller hoped to film it after the release of ''Fury Road''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Brook|title=George Miller's new script|url=http://www.afr.com/p/george_miller_new_script_q1wYu1EFjLM0cyZa4s97fI|website=[[The Australian Financial Review]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|access-date=8 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407192950/http://www.afr.com/p/george_miller_new_script_q1wYu1EFjLM0cyZa4s97fI|archivedate=7 April 2014|date=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, during an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Hardy revealed that he was attached to star in three more ''Mad Max'' films following ''Fury Road''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/film-tv/8074/tom-hardy-esquire-interview/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331190806/http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/film-tv/8074/tom-hardy-esquire-interview/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=31 March 2015|title=Tom Hardy Is Esquire's May Cover Star|first=Miranda|last=Collinge|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=30 March 2015|access-date=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Miller told ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'': "Should ''Fury Road'' be successful, I've got two other stories to tell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/mad-max-fury-road/|title=Mad Max: What it takes to make the most intense movie ever |first=Logan|last=Hill|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=([[Condé Nast]])|date=11 May 2015|access-date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in May, Miller revealed that plans for the sequel had changed and the fifth film in the franchise will instead be titled ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road#Sequel|Mad Max: The Wasteland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lussier|first1=Germain|title=George Miller Gives 'Mad Max: Fury Road' Sequel a Title|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/george-miller-mad-max-fury-road-sequel/|website=[[/Film]]|access-date=19 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519013857/http://www.slashfilm.com/george-miller-mad-max-fury-road-sequel/|archivedate=19 May 2015|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=George Miller Promises 'More Max,' Starting With 'Mad Max: The Wasteland'|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/mad-max-george-miller-announces-more-movies-mad-max-the-wasteland-1201499904/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|access-date=19 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519013352/http://variety.com/2015/film/news/mad-max-george-miller-announces-more-movies-mad-max-the-wasteland-1201499904/|archivedate=19 May 2015|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Miller's team had two scripts for sequels which they ended up with during the writing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/mad-max-the-wasteland-director-george-miller-confirms-fury-road-will-have-two-sequels-a6679756.html|title= Mad Max: The Wasteland: Director George Miller confirms Fury Road will have two sequels|author= Jack Shepherd|work= [[The Independent]]|publisher= Independent Print Limited|date= 5 October 2015|access-date= 11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, he clarified that ''Mad Max: The Wasteland'' was a [[working title]] for the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a673073/mad-max-fury-road-sequel-wont-star-charlize-therons-imperator-furiosa/#~pr3amDojvbH6bH|title= Mad Max Fury Road sequel won't star Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa|author= Simon Reynolds|work= [[Digital Spy]]|publisher= [[Hearst Corporation]]|date= 12 October 2015|access-date= 11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller reaffirmed his intent to continue the franchise after reports to the contrary surfaced following an interview in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/george-miller-new-mad-max-movies/|title=George Miller Will Be Involved with Mad Max Sequels|date=14 January 2016|work=Collider}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, it was reported that a lawsuit filed by Miller's production company against Warner Bros. over a disputed $7 million bonus was likely to delay the production of any sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://amp.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/george-miller-sues-warner-bros-over-mad-max-fury-road-earnings-20171109-gziinh.html|title=Director George Miller sues Warner Bros over Mad Max: Fury Road earnings|date=2017-11-11|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller also wants a Furiosa spin-off starring [[Charlize Theron]] as the one-armed female warrior.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/18/mad-max-fury-road-sequel-george-miller?subid=5542353&amp;CMP=ema_861a&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the sequels and spinoffs have been delayed indefinitely until after the lawsuit is settled.

'''''The Battle of Gettysburg''''', also known as the '''Gettysburg Cyclorama''', is a [[cyclorama]] painting by the French artist [[Paul Philippoteaux]] depicting [[Pickett's Charge]], the climactic [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] attack on the [[Union Army|Union]] forces during the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] on July 3, 1863.&lt;ref name=NPS/&gt;

== Description ==
The painting is the work of French artist Paul Dominique Philippoteaux. It depicts Pickett's Charge, the failed infantry assault that was the climax of the Battle of Gettysburg. The painting is a ''cyclorama'', a type of 360° cylindrical painting. The intended effect is to immerse the viewer in the scene being depicted, often with the addition of foreground models and life-sized replicas to enhance the illusion. Among the sites documented in the painting are [[Cemetery Ridge]], the Angle, and the "[[High-water mark of the Confederacy]]".&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;{{cite web |last=Heiser |first=John |title=The Gettysburg Cyclorama |work=[[Gettysburg National Military Park]] |publisher=National Park Service | url=http://www.nps.gov/gett/historyculture/gettysburg-cyclorama.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completed original painting was {{convert|22|ft|m}} high and {{convert|279|ft|m}} in circumference.&lt;ref name=nando/&gt; The version that hangs in Gettysburg, a recent (2005) restoration of the version created for Boston, is {{convert|42|ft|m}} high and {{convert|377|ft|m}} in circumference.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt;

Philippoteaux became interested in cycloramas and, in collaboration with his father, created ''The Defence of the Fort d'Issy'' in 1871. Other successful works included ''Taking of Plevna'' (Turko-Russian War), the ''Passage of the Balkans'', ''The Belgian Revolution of 1830'', ''Attack in the Park'', ''The Battle of Kars'', ''The Battle of Tel-el-Kebir'', and the ''Derniere Sortie''.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Dean S. |title=The Gettysburg Cyclorama: A Portrayal of the High Tide of the Confederacy |publisher=Thomas Publications |year=1989 |location=Gettysburg, Pennsylvania |pages=17–19 |isbn=0-939631-14-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned by a group of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] investors in 1879 to create the Gettysburg Cyclorama. He spent several weeks in April 1882 at the site of the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]] to sketch and photograph the scene, and extensively researched the battle and its events over several months. He erected a wooden platform along present-day Hancock Avenue and drew a circle around it, eighty feet in diameter, driving stakes into the ground to divide it into ten sections. Local photographer William H. Tipton took three photographs of each section, focusing in turn on the foreground, the land behind it, and the horizon. The photos, pasted together, formed the basis of the composition.&lt;ref name=Appelbaum&gt;{{cite news|last=Appelbaum|first=Yoni|title=The Half-Life of Illusion: On the Brief and Glorious Heyday of the Cyclorama|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/the-half-life-of-illusion-on-the-brief-and-glorious-heyday-of-the-cyclorama/252747/|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Philippoteaux also interviewed several survivors of the battle, including Union generals [[Winfield S. Hancock]], [[Abner Doubleday]], [[Oliver O. Howard]], and [[Alexander S. Webb]], and based his work partly on their recollections.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt;

Philippoteaux enlisted a team of five assistants, including his father until his death, to create the final work.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; It took over a year and a half to complete.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt; The finished painting was nearly 100 yards long and weighed six tons.&lt;ref name="nando"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jarvis |first=Craig |title=Triangle trio buys massive painting |work=[[The News &amp; Observer]] (Raleigh, NC) |publisher=The News and Observer Publishing Company |date=May 2, 2007 |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/569912.html |accessdate=2007-05-03|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003227/http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/569912.html |archivedate = September 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; When completed for display, the full work included not just the painting, but numerous artifacts and sculptures, including stone walls, trees, and fences.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt; The effect of the painting has been likened to the nineteenth century equivalent of an [[IMAX]] theater.&lt;ref name="nando"/&gt;

== Chicago version ==
In 1879, the National Panorama Company, led by Charles Louis Willoughby and supported by Marshall Field, Judge Treat, Jefferson Printing Company and an assortment of other capitalists commissioned the artist Paul Dominique Philippoteaux to begin works on a cyclorama of the Battle of Gettysburg.  Preparation began in 1880 and by 1883 the National Panorama Company had taken possession of the monumental cyclorama painting which became known as the Gettysburg Cyclorama, Chicago version (so-named for the city in which it was first exhibited).

The work opened to the public in Chicago on October 22, 1883, to critical acclaim.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt; General [[John Gibbon]], one of the commanders of the Union forces who repelled Pickett's Charge, was among the veterans of the battle who gave it favorable reviews.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; So realistic was the painting that many veterans of the war were reported to have wept upon seeing it.&lt;ref name="Appelbaum-Great"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/02/the-great-illusion-of-gettysburg/238870/|title=The Great Illusion of Gettysburg|last=Appelbaum|first=Yoni|date=5 February 2012|newspaper=The Atlantic|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago version was re-touched prior to the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California in 1915.  This retouching work was undertaken by a team led by: E. J. Austen (Cyclorama artist of London and later the United States) supported by Charles A. Corwin (later Chief Staff Artist for the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois) and, Salvador Mege (the French cyclorama artist).

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Although the presence of the painting at a "Dallas Exposition" was set out in correspondence, there doesn't appear to be any evidence of an exposition in Dallas in that year.

In 1964 Joseph Wallace King, the North Carolina artist, approached E. W. McConnell to enquire after the whereabouts of the Chicago version, which he later purchased.  It was later donated to Wake Forest University, North Carolina, who sold it to three North Carolina businessmen in 2007 for an undisclosed sum.

== Boston version ==

The Chicago exhibition was sufficiently successful to prompt businessman Charles L. Willoughby to commission a second version, which opened in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], on December 22, 1884. From its opening until 1892, approximately 200,000 people viewed the painting.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt; The Boston version was housed in a specially designed building, the [[Cyclorama Building]], on [[Tremont Street]],&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;{{cite news|title=Work in Progress|last=Morton|first=Margaret|date=July 2007|work=Civil War Times|pages=28–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the site of popular public lectures on the battle.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Two additional copies of the cyclorama were made: the third was first exhibited in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, beginning in February 1886 and a fourth debuted in Brooklyn, New York, in October 1886.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;[[File:Tremont Street Exhibition-Gettysburg.PNG|thumb|right|Ticket to the Boston exhibition of the Gettysburg Cyclorama.]]

Many reviewers and visitors agreed with the ''[[Boston Daily Advertiser]]'' that "it is impossible to tell where reality ends and the painting begins." One veteran, pointing at the painting, said to his friend: "You see that puff of smoke? Just wait a moment till that clears away, and I'll show you just where I stood." In New York, police responding to a report of a nighttime burglary and disoriented by the illusion twice seized dummies representing dead soldiers, convinced that they were live burglars.&lt;ref name="Appelbaum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Appelbaum-Great" /&gt;

In 1891, the Boston cyclorama, housed in the [[Cyclorama Building]], was exchanged temporarily with the cyclorama ''Crucifixion of Christ''&lt;ref&gt;Also one of Philippoteaux's works, ''Crucifixion'' is now on display at [[Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, Quebec]].&lt;/ref&gt; in Philadelphia. When it returned in 1892, it was stored in a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} crate behind the exhibition hall, where it was subjected to damage from weather, vandals removing boards from the crate, and two fires. It was eventually purchased in its deteriorated state by Albert J. Hahne of [[Newark, New Jersey]], in 1910. Hahne displayed sections of the cyclorama in his department store in Newark beginning in 1911, and sections were also shown in government buildings in [[New York City]], [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] In the Baltimore exhibition, [[George E. Pickett]]'s widow, "Sallie" Pickett, lectured on her husband's experiences and found herself very moved by the experience.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;

[[File:Gettysburg cyclorama.jpg|thumb|right|Interior view of the Gettysburg Cyclorama in the former, Neutra building location]]

On September 3, 1912, ground was broken for a new cyclorama building on Baltimore Street in Gettysburg, on Cemetery Hill (on the site of the present day [[Holiday Inn]]), near the entrance to the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery|Soldiers' National Cemetery]]. It opened to the public in 1913, in time for the 50th anniversary of the battle, once again displayed as a full circular painting, rather than in sections. The unheated, leaky brick building took a further toll on the condition of the painting. The Boston cyclorama was purchased by the [[National Park Service]] in 1942, and moved to a site on Ziegler's Grove near the new Visitor's Center in 1961, after a second round of restoration.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt;

The exhibition remained open to the public until 2005, when it was closed for a third restoration.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt; The $12-million restoration, by Olin Conservation, Inc., of Great Falls, Virginia, started with the 26 sections of the painting and recreated its original shape of 14 panels hung from a circular railing, slightly flared out at the bottom. In the process, some original pieces were found of the 12 circumferential feet that had been cut away. Fourteen vertical feet of sky was also restored.&lt;ref name="Morton"/&gt;

The painting restoration was accompanied by the construction of a facility to house the painting, the new Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center on Hunt Avenue, located away from any areas in which fighting occurred in 1863. The restored Cyclorama exhibition was reopened to the public in September 2008. The proposed demolition of the [[Richard Neutra's Cyclorama Building|old Cyclorama building]] in Ziegler's Grove was a source of some controversy among history and architecture buffs, with some opposing the destruction of the [[modernism|modernist]] structure designed by architect [[Richard Neutra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Latest: Recent Past Preservation Network Sues National Park Service to Prevent Demolition of Historic Building at Gettysburg |work=CYCLORAMA: Richard Neutra's 1961 Lincoln Memorial at Gettysburg |publisher=Mission66.com |url=http://www.mission66.com/cyclorama/ |accessdate=2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, it was razed in early 2013, and the site restored to its wartime appearance.&lt;ref&gt;"Gettysburg National Military Park's Old Cyclorama Building Is No More," National Parks Traveler http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2013/04/gettysburg-national-military-parks-old-cyclorama-building-no-more23011&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Benedict "Buck-eye" ==
A buck-eye cyclorama is a term used to describe a cyclorama painting of the same or roughly the same dimensions as an original which is a very slavish copy.  Often these were created cheaply by painters of little skill and, almost always, with sub-standard materials.  Several buck-eye cycloramas were exhibited in the United States during the time when cyclorama paintings were popular attractions including several copies of the Gettysburg Cyclorama.  Once an individual had seen a particular cyclorama it was unlikely that they would purchase a ticket to revisit it, so these low-quality copies could be exhibited with a very low risk that a ticket holder would request a refund, as they would likely never have seen the original.  Tickets could be sold at the same price as the admission to see an original and the exhibitor of a buck-eye could visit the original themselves, obtain copies of all of the pamphlets and promotional materials and have them cheaply copied for sale alongside the attraction.  In fact, copy houses were formed in order to meet the demand for such paintings, one being the Milwaukee Panorama Painters.

In 1885 the Milwaukee Panorama Painters were commissioned by Mr. Myron Herrick (at that time a banker, who later twice served as the U.S. Ambassador to France) to create a copy of the Gettysburg Cyclorama, which was later purchased by E. W. McConnell (the "Cyclorama King") and exhibited by McConnell at: the Cotton States Exposition, Atlanta, Georgia in 1895; the Tennessee Centennial Exposition, Nashville, Tennessee in 1897; before moving to Louisville, Kentucky; and finally, to Nashville, Tennessee in 1898 before it was placed in storage in that city.  During the time of McConnell's ownership, McConnell sold a share of the painting to a Mr. Benedict who, in turn, sold a share of his share to a Mr. Graves.

In 1920, more than 20 years after the buck-eye had been placed into storage, Benedict informed McConnell that a flood had ruined the buck-eye painting, but failed to inform Graves.  Graves was not available to be consulted when questions from his family arose regarding the whereabouts of the buck-eye (in 1957) and the beneficiaries of Graves' Estate later made the assumption that the painting purchased by Mr. Joseph Wallace King (the Chicago Version) in 1964 was this 'missing' buck-eye painting.  The estate then launched a legal action against King, claiming that a share of the painting King had purchased was theirs. This case was settled in arbitration by the comparison of photographs of the buck-eye with the painting King had purchased and the matters were resolved in King's favour, as the buck-eye was obviously of inferior quality to the Chicago Version which King had in his possession.

In 1957 the Milwaukee County Historical Society contacted the firm of lawyers who had been acting for McConnell and asked if they could purchase the painting and were informed that it had been destroyed.

[[Image:Battledore decoration,hagoita,katori-city,japan.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Hagoita-kazari (羽子板飾り)]]
'''Hagoita''' (羽子板 ｢はごいた｣) are rectangular wooden [[paddle]]s, originating in [[Japan]], ostensibly used to play [[hanetsuki]], but often instead serving a more ornamental purpose. These are frequently painted, usually with [[lacquer]], with auspicious symbols, or decorated with complex silk [[collage]]s. This tradition dates to the 17th century, and although the game itself is now rarely played, crafting decorative hagoita is still commonplace. They are generally sold at traditional fairs (''hagoita ichi'') which are held in December. In [[Tokyo]], they are sold at shrines, especially [[Asakusa Jinja|Asakusa]] and [[Furukawa Fudō]].

The '''International Council on Monuments and Sites''' ('''ICOMOS'''; {{lang-fr|links=no|Conseil international des monuments et des sites}}) is a professional association that works for the conservation and protection of cultural heritage places around the world. Now headquartered in Paris, ICOMOS was founded in 1965 in [[Warsaw]] as a result of the [[Venice Charter]] of 1964, and offers advice to [[UNESCO]] on [[World Heritage Site]]s.

The idea behind ICOMOS dates to the Athens Conference on the restoration of historic buildings in 1931, organized by the International Museums Office. The [[Athens Charter (Preservation)|Athens Charter]] of 1931 introduced the concept of international heritage. In 1964, the Second Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings, meeting in [[Venice]], adopted 13 resolutions. The first created the International Charter on the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites, better known as [[Venice Charter]]; the second, put forward by [[UNESCO]], created ICOMOS to carry out this charter.

ICOMOS currently has over 9,500 individual members in 144 countries, 110 national committees and 28 international scientific committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Introducing ICOMOS – International Council on Monuments and Sites|url = http://www.icomos.org/index.php/en/about-icomos/mission-and-vision/mission-and-vision|website = www.icomos.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; With rare exceptions, each member must be qualified in the field of conservation and a practicing landscape architect, architect, archaeologist, anthropologist, town planner, engineer, administrator of heritage, historian, art historian, [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] or [[archive|archivist]].

ICOMOS is a partner in the [[International Committee of the Blue Shield]] (ICBS), which works to protect the world's cultural heritage threatened by wars and natural disasters.

==ICOMOS structure==
ICOMOS is composed of its national committees (NCs), to which individuals and institutions apply for membership. In addition to the national committees, ICOMOS has a series of international scientific committees (ISCs), in which experts in a certain field of activity within the context of heritage conservation exchange views and debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/publications/EN_Statuts_1978_20110301.pdf |title=ICOMOS Statutes, adopted by the Vth General Assembly on 22 May 1978 in Moscow |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is headed by a president, five vice-presidents, a secretary-general and a treasurer all directly elected by the general assembly of the organization. 12 additional members are also elected by the [http://www.international.icomos.org/en/about-icomos/governance/general-information-about-the-general-assembly General Assembly] into the [http://www.international.icomos.org/en/about-icomos/governance/general-information-about-the-executive-committee Executive Committee] and five further members are co-opted into the executive board in order to represent regions of the world or areas of expertise that were not part of the executive committee following the elections. ''Ex officio'' members of the executive committee are the president of the [http://www.international.icomos.org/en/about-icomos/governance/general-information-on-the-advisory-committee advisory committee] and the previous presidents of ICOMOS, who attend in advisory capacity. The executive committee is the executive body of ICOMOS.

The [http://www.international.icomos.org/en/about-icomos/governance/general-information-on-the-advisory-committee advisory committee] is composed of the chairpersons of the national committees, the chairpersons of the international scientific committees and the president of ICOMOS as an ''ex officio'' member.&lt;ref&gt;Article 12, ICOMOS Statutes, adopted by the Vth General Assembly on 22 May 1978 in Moscow&lt;/ref&gt; The advisory committee was given the task to advise and make recommendations to the General Assembly and the Executive Committee on matters which concern policy and programme priorities.

===National committees===
National committees are subsidiary organizations created in the countries which are members of UNESCO. They bring together individual and institutional members and offer them a framework for discussion and an exchange of information. ICOMOS has national committees in 108 countries as of August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icomos.org/images/DOCUMENTS/Secretariat/Adresses/adresses-cn.pdf |title=Members of the Advisory Committee |publisher=International.icomos.org |accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each national committee adopts its own rules of procedure and elaborates its own program according to the goals and aims of ICOMOS.

&lt;ref&gt;Article 14, ICOMOS Statutes, adopted by the Vth General Assembly on 22 May 1978 in Moscow&lt;/ref&gt;
Usually known as "international scientific committees" (ISCs), these entities focus on specialised areas of heritage conservation and are made up of members of the organisation drawn from those specialist areas.  The scientific programmes of the organisation are coordinated by the 'scientific council" made up of the presidents of the ISCs. The following ISCs operate within ICOMOS:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of International Scientific Committees|url=http://icomos.org/en/network/international-scientific-committees/list-of-international-scientific-committees|publisher=ICOMOS|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICOMOS charters and doctrinal texts==
In the tradition of the Athens and Venice Charters, ICOMOS has in the years since its formation developed and adopted a number of other charters and doctrinal texts which provide guidance to heritage conservation professionals in their work.  Most such documents are created by the international committees of the organisation and thereafter adopted by the triennial General Assembly. The texts each address a specific area of professional practice in the heritage conservation professions. Following the 17th ICOMOS General Assembly held in Paris in November 2011, the list of charters is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icomos.org/en/what-we-do/involvement-in-international-conventions/standards ICOMOS Charters and Other Doctrinal Texts].

In addition to the above there are fifteen other doctrinal texts. These include the "Nara Document".

Many of the national committees of ICOMOS have adopted their own charters which set standards for heritage conservation practice at national level.&lt;ref name=icmos&gt;{{cite web|title=CHARTERS ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF ICOMOS|url=http://icomos.org/en/charters-and-texts|publisher=ICOMOS|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICOMOS and the World Heritage Convention==
In 1972, ICOMOS was named by the UNESCO [[World Heritage Convention]] as one of the three formal advisory bodies to the World Heritage Committee, along with the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM). As the professional and scientific adviser to the committee on all aspects of the cultural heritage, ICOMOS is responsible for the evaluation of all nominations of cultural properties made to the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]] with the criteria laid down by the [[World Heritage Committee]]. In addition to the basic criterion of “outstanding universal value,” ICOMOS evaluates nominations for aspects related to authenticity, management, and conservation as specified in the World Heritage Convention.

The evaluation of nominations involves consultation between the wide-ranging expertise represented by the organization’s membership and its national and scientific committees. Members are also sent on expert missions to carry out on-site evaluations of nominated properties. This extensive consultation results in the preparation of detailed recommendations that are submitted to the World Heritage Committee at its annual meetings.

ICOMOS is also involved, through its International Secretariat and its national and scientific committees, in the preparation of reports on the state of conservation of properties inscribed on the World Heritage List. It advises the [http://whc.unesco.org/ UNESCO World Heritage Centre] on requests for technical assistance received from states that are party to (i.e. have ratified) the World Heritage Convention. ICOMOS maintains a full archive of nominations and reports at the documentation centre at its Paris headquarters.

===Nara Document on Authenticity===
In November 1994, at the [[Nara, Japan|Nara]] Conference on Authenticity, ICOMOS published the [[Nara Document on Authenticity]], which addresses the need for a broader understanding of cultural diversity and cultural heritage in [[conservation and restoration|conservation]] efforts involving cultural heritage sites.&lt;ref&gt;

== Piero Gazzola award ==
In 1979, ICOMOS instituted its highest award, named after its first president, Piero Gazzola, to laud the life-time achievements of one of its members. The prize is awarded every three years, and comprises a commemorative medal, a diploma and 10,000 US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Awards, honors &amp; prizes: International and foreign|page=312|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbiKlgGo4NEC|volume=2|year=2001|publisher=Gale Group|isbn=978-0-7876-3405-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jambo''' (April 17, 1961 – September 11, 1992) was a [[gorilla]] housed at [[Durrell Wildlife Park]] in [[Jersey|Jersey, Channel Islands]]. He was involved in an incident in which he was seen to be protective of a child who fell into his enclosure.

==Early life==
"[[Jambo!]]" means "hello" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. The gorilla was born on April 17, 1961, in [[Zoo Basel]], [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], to mother ''Achilla'' and father ''Stephi''. Stephi was acquired from the [[Columbus Zoo and Aquarium|Columbus Zoo]] in Ohio. Stephi was captured in 1950 by Columbus resident and gorilla hunter Bill Said, with two other baby gorillas, in [[French Equatorial Africa]]. The three were sold to the Columbus Zoo for $10,000. The two which the Columbus Zoo kept, Baron Macombo and Millie Christina, became the parents of Colo, the first gorilla born in a zoo, in Columbus on December 22, 1956.  She was the first gorilla born in captivity as well as the first gorilla in captivity to be raised by her own mother.

Jambo's older sister Goma, born on September 23, 1959 in Basel, was the first gorilla born in Europe and lived in the Zoo Basel until her death in 2018&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zoobasel.ch/en/aktuell/detail.php?NEWSID=1130&lt;/ref&gt;. Before Jambo was transferred to Jersey Zoo, Jambo and Goma had a son named Tamtam, who was born at Zoo Basel on May 2, 1971, and died at Wuppertal Zoo on July 23, 2009. Jambo also fathered a daughter while still at Zoo Basel by an unrelated female. Jambo had 7 siblings and 20 offspring by 5 different mates, including three stillbirths.

Jambo was moved to [[Durrell Wildlife Park|Jersey Zoo]] on April 27, 1972.

==Rescue of Levan Merritt==
Jambo rose to international news stardom on August 31, 1986, when five-year-old Levan Merritt fell into the gorilla enclosure and lost consciousness. Jambo stood guard over the boy when he was unconscious, placing himself between the boy and other gorillas in what [[ethologist]]s analyze as a protective gesture. He later stroked the unconscious boy's back. When the boy regained consciousness and started to cry, Jambo and the other gorillas retreated in panic, and the silverback led them into the little house. A paramedic and two keepers rescued the boy. Most of the drama was recorded on home video, and extensively photographed by zoo visitors. The publicity on major news channels and newspapers helped ease public fears about the potentially violent nature of gorillas.

A similar incident occurred in 1996 at [[Brookfield Zoo]] in [[Brookfield, Illinois]], when the gorilla [[Binti Jua]] protected a three-year-old boy who had fallen into the gorilla enclosure.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:La Mênag'gie d'Jèrri siez Durrell 2013 196.jpg|thumb|Statue of Jambo by [[Ralph Brown (sculptor)|Ralph Brown]] at Durrell Wildlife Park]]
Jambo was found dead by his [[zookeeper|keeper]] Richard Johnstone-Scott in the gorilla enclosure on September 16, 1992. The cause of death was a spontaneous rupture of the major artery, resulting in a massive hemorrhage in his chest.  A biography of Jambo, written and illustrated by his keeper, was published following his death. A documentary has also been released primarily based on the home video footage of the Levan Merritt incident.

Jersey Zoo has erected a bronze statue of Jambo inside the zoo grounds as a tribute to the gorilla who helped change public perception about the species.

Matejko spent most of his life in [[Kraków]]. His teachers at the [[Kraków Academy of Fine Arts]] included [[Wojciech Korneli Stattler]] and [[Władysław Łuszczkiewicz]].

==Biography==

===Youth===

Matejko was born on 24 June 1838, in the [[Free City of Kraków]].&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; His father, [[Franciszek Ksawery Matejko]] ({{lang-cs|František Xaver Matějka}}) (born 1789 or 13 January 1793, died 26 October 1860), a Czech from the village of [[Roudnice]], was a graduate of the [[Hradec Králové]] school who later became a tutor and [[music teacher]].&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; He first worked for the Wodzicki family in Kościelniki, Poland, then moved to [[Kraków]], where he married the half-German, half-Polish Joanna Karolina Rossberg (Rozberg).&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; Jan was the ninth child of eleven children.&lt;ref name="szypowska12"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Szypowska|title=Jan Matejko wszystkim znany|year=2016|publisher=Fundacja Artibus-Wurlitzer oraz Wydawn.

Domu Słowa Polskiego|isbn=9788377858448|language=Polish|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his mother in 1845, Jan and his siblings were cared for by his maternal aunt, Anna Zamojska.&lt;ref name="szypowska12"/&gt;

[[File:Rodzeństwo Matejki.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of Matejko's father, Franciszek, and three of his children. An early work of Matejko from 1853]]
At a young age he witnessed the [[Kraków Uprising|Kraków revolution]] of 1846 and the 1848 [[siege of Kraków]] by the Austrians, the two events which ended the existence of the [[Free City of Kraków]].&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; His two older brothers served in these battles, under General [[Józef Bem]]; one died and the other was forced into exile.&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; Matejko attended [[Bartłomiej Nowodworski High School|St. Ann's High School]], but he dropped out in 1851 because of poor grades.&lt;ref name="szypowska182223"/&gt; From his earliest days Matejko showed artistic talent, but had great difficulty with other academic areas.&lt;ref name="szypowska182223"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Szypowska|title=Jan Matejko wszystkim znany|year=2016|publisher=Fundacja Artibus-Wurlitzer oraz Wydawn.

Domu Słowa Polskiego|isbn=9788377858448|language=Polish|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- and did not do well even with his native [[Polish language|Polish]]. As a result, the public appearances he was obliged to make all his life must have been difficult for him. {{cn}} --&gt; Despite that, and because of his exceptional skill, he studied at the [[School of Fine Arts in Kraków]] from 1852 to 1858.&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; His teachers included [[Wojciech Korneli Stattler]] and [[Władysław Łuszczkiewicz]].&lt;ref name="szypowska25"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Szypowska|title=Jan Matejko wszystkim znany|year=2016|publisher=Fundacja Artibus-Wurlitzer oraz Wydawn. Domu Słowa Polskiego|isbn=9788377858448|language=Polish|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He selected [[historical painting]] as his specialization, and finished his first major work, ''Tsars Shuyski before Zygmunt III'' (''Carowie Szujscy przed Zygmuntem III''), in 1853 (he would return to this topic in a year before his death, in 1892&lt;ref name="MatejkoMalinowski1993"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jan Matejko|author2=Jerzy Malinowski|author3=Krystyna Sroczyńska|author4=Jurij Birjułow|title=Matejko: Album|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8suAQAAIAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Arkady|language=Polish|quote=Matejko malował nadto dwukrotnie sceny hołdu carów Szujskich przed Zygmuntem III w 1853 i 1892 roku."}} [Google Books does not display page number for this book]&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="szypowska25"/&gt;&lt;ref name=psb185/&gt; During this time, he began exhibiting historical paintings at the [[Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts]] (starting with 1855).&lt;ref name=psb185&gt;Bochnak (1975), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; His seminal project for his graduation in 1858 was ''[[Sigismund I the Old]] ennobles the professors of the [[Jagiellonian University]]'' (''Zygmunt I nadaje szlachectwo profesorom Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego'').&lt;ref name="szypowska39"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Szypowska|title=Jan Matejko wszystkim znany|year=2016|publisher=Fundacja Artibus-Wurlitzer oraz Wydawn. Domu Słowa Polskiego|isbn=9788377858448|language=Polish|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation,&lt;ref name="szypowska39"/&gt; Matejko received a scholarship in 1859 to study with [[Hermann Anschütz]] at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]].&lt;ref name=psb185/&gt; The following year he received a scholarship to study at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]] as well, but after a few days and a major quarrel with [[Christian Ruben]], Matejko returned to Kraków.&lt;ref name=psb186/&gt; and opened a studio at his family home in Floriańska Street.&lt;ref name=psb186/&gt; It would however be years before he would gain commercial success; for a time he was the proverbial "starving artist", who celebrated when he sold a canvas (the ''Tsars Shuyski...'') for five [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]].&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt;

In 1860 Matejko published an illustrated album, ''[[Clothing in Poland (Matejko)|Clothing in Poland]]'' (''Ubiory w Polsce''), a project reflecting his intense interest in historical records of all kinds and his desire to promote such interest among Polish people, to intensify their patriotism.&lt;ref name=psb186/&gt; His financial situation improved when he sold two paintings, ''Death of Wapowski during the crowning of Henry Valois'' (''Zabicie Wapowskiego w czasie koronacji Henryka Walezego'', 1861) and ''Jan Kochanowski mourning his daughter Urszulka'' (''Jan Kochanowski nad zwłokami Urszulki'', 1862), which settled his debts.&lt;ref name="szypowska78"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Szypowska|title=Jan Matejko wszystkim znany|year=2016|publisher=Fundacja Artibus-Wurlitzer oraz Wydawn. Domu Słowa Polskiego|isbn=9788377858448|language=Polish|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1862 he finished a painting, ''[[Stańczyk (painting)|Stańczyk]]''. Initially received without much applause, in time this would become known as one of Matejko's most famous masterpieces.&lt;ref name="szypowska85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Szypowska|title=Jan Matejko wszystkim znany|year=2016|publisher=Fundacja Artibus-Wurlitzer oraz Wydawn. Domu Słowa Polskiego|isbn=9788377858448|language=Polish|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marks a visible transition in Matejko's art style, from simply illustrating history to creating a philosophical and moral commentary of it.&lt;ref name=psb186/&gt;

During the [[January Uprising]] of 1863, in which he did not participate because of poor health, Matejko gave financial support, donating most of his savings to the cause, and personally [[Gunrunning|transported arms]] to the insurgents' camp.&lt;ref name=psb186&gt;Bochnak (1975), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Skarga's Sermon]]'' (''Kazanie Skargi''), finished in May 1864, was displayed in the gallery of the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts, which gained him much publicity.&lt;ref name=psb186/&gt; On 5 November that year, in recognition for his contributions to recreating historical themes, he became a member of the [[Kraków Scientific Society]] (''Towarzystwo Naukowe Krakowskie'').&lt;ref name="Słoczyński2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henryk Marek Słoczyński|title=Matejko|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUVMAAAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Wydawn.

At that time Matejko started to gain international recognition. In 1865, Matejko's painting ''Skarga's Sermon'' was awarded a gold medal at the yearly Paris salon; soon afterwards Count {{ILL|Maurycy Potocki|pl}} bought it for 10,000 guldens.&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; In 1867, his painting ''[[Rejtan (painting)|Rejtan]]'' was awarded a gold medal at the [[International Exposition (1867)|World Exhibition]] in Paris and acquired by Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] for 50,000 franks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Projekt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDAtAQAAIAAJ|year=1992|publisher=Prasa-Książka-Ruch|page=cxliii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matejko1993-1963"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Matejko|title=Matejko: obrazy olejne : katalog|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WMsuAQAAIAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Arkady|isbn=978-83-213-3652-7|page=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next major painting was the ''[[Union of Lublin (painting)|Union of Lublin]]'' (''Unia Lubelska''), created in the years 1867-1869. Once again applauded in Paris, it won Matejko a Cross of the French [[Légion d'honneur]].&lt;ref name=psb187&gt;Bochnak (1975), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; and was purchased by the [[Sejm of Galicia]].&lt;ref name=psb188/&gt; ''Union...'' was followed by ''[[Stefan Batory at Pskov]]'' (''Stefan Batory pod Pskowem''), finished in 1871.&lt;ref name=psb187/&gt; In 1872 he visited [[Istanbul]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]], and upon his return to Kraków finished ''[[Astronomer Copernicus, or Conversations with God]]'' (''Astronom Kopernik, czyli rozmowa z Bogiem''), which was acquired by the [[Jagiellonian University]].&lt;ref name=psb187/&gt; From the 1870s he was aided in many tasks by a secretary, [[Marian Gorzkowski]], who would become his "right hand", his closest friend, a model for a number of paintings, and an author of memoirs about Matejko.&lt;ref name=psb188/&gt;&lt;ref name="WyspiańskiRydlowa1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanisław Wyspiański|author2=Maria Rydlowa|title=Listy Stanisława Wyspiańskiego do Józefa Mehoffera, Henryka Opieńskiego i Tadeusza Stryjeńskiego|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVphAAAAMAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Wydawnictwo Literackie|isbn=978-83-08-02562-8|page=75|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872 during an exhibition in [[Prague]] he was offered a directorship of the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Prague]], and soon afterwards, a similar position at Kraków's School of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name=psb187/&gt; He accepted the Kraków offer, and was for many years the principal ([[Rector (academia)|rector]]) of the Academy of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name=psb187/&gt; In 1874 he finished ''[[Zawieszenie dzwonu Zygmunta]]'' (''The Hanging of the Sigismund bell'').&lt;ref name=WM/&gt; In 1878 he finished another masterpiece, ''[[Battle of Grunwald (painting)|Battle of Grunwald]]''.&lt;ref name=psb188&gt;Bochnak (1975), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; That year he received an "honorary grand gold" medal in Paris, and the city council of Kraków presented him with a ceremonial [[scepter]], a symbol of his "royal status in fine arts".&lt;ref name=psb188/&gt; In 1879 he finished ''[[Rok 1863 - Polonia]]'' (Year 1863 - Polonia), his take on the [[January Uprising]] of that time.

==Significance, style and themes==

[[File:GrobowiecJanaMatejki-CmentarzRakowicki-POL, Kraków.jpg|thumb|Matejko's tomb]]He is counted among the most famous [[Polish painters]],&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MioPa"/&gt; described as "Poland's greatest historical painter"&lt;ref name="Reddaway1971"/&gt; and "a cult figure to the nation at large... [already] by the time of his death.".&lt;ref name=WM/&gt; His style was praised for being "colourful, detailed and imaginative".&lt;ref name=WM/&gt; He succeeded in propagating Polish history, and reminding the world about Poland, while his country remained partitioned and without any independent political representation.&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt; His works, disseminated in thousands of reproductions, have become almost standard illustrations of many key events in [[Polish history]].&lt;ref name="TPaP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MioPa"/&gt; His 1860 illustrated album ''Ubiory w Polsce'' (Clothing in Poland) is seen as a valuable historical reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muzeum.krakow.pl/Wystawa.1106.0.html?&amp;cHash=1c6a6d9bec42ba80c47995258e045fb5&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=1105&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=5274 |title=WYSTAWA: Wielka rekwizytornia artysty.

In addition to history paintings Matejko made also numerous portraits.&lt;ref name=psb189/&gt; Among others: portraits of Jagiellonian University rectors [[Józef Szujski]] and [[Stanisław Tarnowski]], and numerous portraits of family and friends, including ''Wife in the wedding dress'' ("Żona w sukni ślubnej") (1865, destroyed by his wife during a quarrel and recreated in 1879) and a self-portrait (1892).&lt;ref name=psb189/&gt; Altogether Matejko authored 320 [[oil paintings]] and several thousands [[drawings]] and [[watercolors]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} He also designed the [[polychrome]] in [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków]] (1889–1891).&lt;ref name="Serafińska1958"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanisława Serafińska|title=Jan Matejko: wspomnienia rodzinne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUhsYBacEW8C|year=1958|publisher=Wydawn.

'''Mary Ann Esposito''' (born August 3, 1942 in [[Buffalo, New York]]) is an American [[chef]], cookbook writer, and the television host of ''Ciao Italia with Mary Ann Esposito'', which started in 1989 and is the longest-running television cooking program in America.&lt;ref name="Copps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt; Esposito has published over a dozen [[cookbook]]s.&lt;ref name="Copps"&gt;{{cite web | author= Copps, Annie  | year=2008 | title=Dinner with Guy and Mary Ann Esposito | work =[[Yankee (magazine)|Yankee]] | url=http://www.yankeemagazine.com/blogs/foodblog/maryannesposito | access-date= February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
She was raised in [[Buffalo, New York]].&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt; Her mother was a [[dietician]].&lt;ref name="PIC"/&gt;

Her grandmothers, both professional chefs,&lt;ref&gt;Staff (undated).  [https://www.pbs.org/food/chefs/mary-ann-esposito "Mary Ann Esposito"]. [[PBS]]. Retrieved September 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; moved to the United States from Italy in the 1890s. Her paternal grandmother, from [[Sicily]], owned a [[butcher shop]] in [[Fairport, New York]], and her maternal grandmother lived in Buffalo, where she owned a [[boarding house]]. The latter grandmother was from [[Naples]], and continued the traditions of her Italian household within the boarding house. The boarding house was the only house in the neighborhood that had a [[bathtub]], and on Friday nights she would offer neighbors a bath and dinner for a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]. While her grandmothers provided traditional Italian food, Esposito desired to eat standard foods like other children: [[Wonder Bread]] and [[iceberg lettuce]].&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt;

Esposito, who never intended to pursue a career in cooking, learned to cook from her family. Her grandmothers made bread every day, with Esposito helping to make upwards of twenty loaves of bread a day, [[canning]] vegetables and fruits, and helping to prepare ingredients for meals. Eventually, Esposito attended college, where she would graduate with a teaching degree and become an [[elementary school]] teacher.

In 1979, her mother sent her a [[pasta]] maker, and despite a lack of interest in cooking as an adult, Esposito taught herself how to make pasta [[dough]]. The following year, she and her husband Guy&lt;ref name="Copps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt; visited Italy for the first time, visiting his cousins. While in Italy, Esposito started attending a [[cooking class]].

She began learning the history of Italian cooking, region by region, and traveling to the country twice a year for cooking lessons. At the [[University of New Hampshire]] she took classes to learn how to speak [[Italian language|Italian]]. By 1985, she had joined the history master's program at the university, writing her [[thesis]] about [[Italian Renaissance]] cooking.&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt;

==Career==
Esposito started teaching cooking through the [[University of New Hampshire]]'s Division of [[Continuing Education]]. In the mid-1980s, she submitted a proposal for a cooking show to [[New Hampshire Public Television]]. The show was delayed production because of the small size of the television station; however, upon moving to a larger station, a [[television pilot|pilot]] was taped. The pilot was a test to not only gauge viewer reception, but, to also see how Esposito would be on camera. On the hottest day of the year in the region, the television crew came to Esposito's home in [[Durham, New Hampshire]], and the pilot was taped. Upon airing, the pilot received great reception and the longest-running television cooking show was born.&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt;

Esposito has published over a dozen cooking books about Italian cooking and entertaining. Her 1997 book, ''What You Knead'', about [[breadmaking]], was awarded best in category by the [[International Cookbook Revue]] and was named one of ''[[Food &amp; Wine]]'' magazine's top cookbooks of 1997.&lt;ref name="Pavich"/&gt; She makes over forty public appearances a year nationally&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt; and has appeared on the ''[[Today Show (NBC)|Today Show]]'', ''[[Regis and Kathie Lee]]'', [[QVC]], the [[Food Network]], [[Martha Stewart Living Radio]], and other programs.&lt;ref name="Pavich"/&gt; She contributed to ''[[The Huffington Post]]''&lt;ref name="HPBlog"&gt;{{cite web | author= Staff (undated)| title=Mary Ann Esposito – Creator &amp; Host, ''Ciao Italia''  | work =[[The Huffington Post]] | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-ann-esposito | access-date= February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[New Hampshire Home]]''.&lt;ref name="NHH"&gt;{{cite web | author=Esposity, Mary Ann | year=2010 | title=Home Cooking with Mary Ann Esposito | work=[[New Hampshire Home]] | url=http://www.nhhomemagazine.com/home/945184-421/home-cooking-with-mary-ann-esposito-homemade.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130208134023/http://www.nhhomemagazine.com/home/945184-421/home-cooking-with-mary-ann-esposito-homemade.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=February 8, 2013 | access-date=February 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ciao Italia with Mary Ann Esposito''===
''Ciao Italia with Mary Ann Esposito,'' is a thirty-minute [[cooking show]] produced for [[PBS]] by Esposito's own Mary Esposito Productions, and taped at New Hampshire Public Television. The show features Esposito's recipes and cooking tips, and visits from guest chefs. She also explores the history of Italian cooking and food.&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt; Through the show, Esposito seeks to help her viewers learn about new recipes that are "doable, authentic, and good."&lt;ref name="PIC"&gt;{{cite web | author= Marie| date = January 10, 2010 | title=An Interview with Mary Ann Esposito of Ciao Italia | publisher=Proud Italian Cook | url= http://www.prouditaliancook.com/2010/01/interview-with-mary-ann-esposito-of.html | access-date= September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When deciding what to feature on the show, Esposito has four standards: she must like to eat the food, the ingredients should be easy to find, the recipe should be something unique and new to the viewer, and should be manageable by the kitchen staff. Every episode has twenty volunteers who work on the show. An entire season of shows, generally about thirty-two episodes, can be taped within two weeks during the summer, with two to three shows being taped a day.

All of the food is made from scratch in the studio, with each dish being prepared in numerous batches and at different recipe stages. This allows Esposito to execute an entire recipe in a matter of minutes that might take hours to complete. All of the recipes are planned by Esposito and the kitchen staff. Volunteers gather all the pertinent ingredients from local markets and go to [[Boston]] for specialty foods if unavailable locally.

Recipes are prepared the day of the show. ''Ciao Italia'' is not scripted. The studio set is loosely based on Esposito's home kitchen. The view out the window of the set is painted to appear as the view of the [[Oyster River (New Hampshire)|Oyster River]], which is seen from her home kitchen. To prepare for shows, Esposito researches and tests recipes outside the studio.&lt;ref name="Paine"&gt;{{cite web | author= Paine, Margaret Anne (undated) | year= | title=A Taste of Italy | work=[[University of New Hampshire Magazine]] | url=http://unhmagazine.unh.edu/sp00/maryannsp00.html | access-date= February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognitions==
A scholarship foundation named after and maintained by Esposito awards scholarships for students seeking [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] to study [[culinary arts]].&lt;ref name="JWU"&gt;{{cite web | author= Press release (undated) | title=JWU Announces Winner of First Mary Ann Esposito Foundation Scholarship Lila Cornelio of Chicago Will Receive $10,000 in Financial Aid for Her Final Two Years of Culinary Studies | publisher=[[Johnson &amp; Wales University]] | url=http://www.jwu.edu/content.aspx?id=37558 | access-date= September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esposito was awarded an [[honorary degree]] from [[St. Anselm College]].&lt;ref name="Pavich"&gt;{{cite web | author= Stupakoff, Loraine | date = August 2010 | title=Exclusive Interview: Celebrity Chef Mary Ann Esposito – Host of 'Ciao Italia' | publisher= ItaliaLiving.com | url=http://www.italialiving.com/articles/food-wine/an-interview-with-celebrity-chef-mary-ann-esposito/ | access-date= February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has received the Lifetime Achievement Award in the Culinary and Cultural Arts of Italy by the [[Order Sons of Italy in America]]. She is in the Hall of Fame for the [[Italian Trade Commission]].&lt;ref name="Pavich"/&gt;

On June 2, 2013, a knighthood was bestowed upon her by the [[President of the Italian Republic]] under the title ''Cavaliere dell'Ordine della Stella d'Italia'' ([[Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity#Order of the Star of Italy (2011-present)|Knight of the Order of the Star of Italy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Staff (undated).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1882">'''Meldred''' is a character who appears in literary accounts of [[post-Roman Britain]].  He may have been a petty king or chieftain in part of what is now southern [[Scotland]] for a period in the 6th Century. The village of [[Drumelzier]] in Peeblesshire may take its name from him and his seat of power may have been the fort of Tinnis Castle.&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson, T. (2016), ''Scotland's Merlin: A Medieval Legend and its Dark Age Origins'', Birlinn, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;  He is of interest as the first named political leader associated with the [[Scottish Borders]] in the post-Roman period and a character in the source texts on which the Arthurian Romances are based.

== Death of Lailoken ==

In ''Vitae Merlini Silvestris'',&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, W. &amp; MacQueen, J. (eds) (1989), ''Vita Merlini Silvestris'', Scottish Sudies 29, pp. 77-93&lt;/ref&gt; a source text for the literary character [[Merlin]], Meldred features as the captor of [[Lailoken]], a warrior so traumatised by the scale of the slaughter he witnesses at the Battle of [[Arfderydd]] (Arthuret) in 573 that he retreats to the [[Caledonian Forest|Great Wood of Caledon]], where he lives as a wild man.  Lailoken's madness endows him with the gift of prophecy and Meldred holds him captive in his fortess at Drumeller in the hope of extracting prophecies which he can use to his advantage.  During negotiations over his release, Lailoken draws attention to a leaf caught in the queen's wimple which he claims is evidence of an assignation with her lover in the king's garden.  Lailoken secures his release, but the queen takes revenge on him for revealing her affair by arranging to have him ambushed and killed by a gang of shepherds.  Meldred has Lailoken buried in the churchyard to the east of his fortress, close to where the Powsail Burn joins the [[River Tweed]].

This article is about the modern architecture and town-planning of [[Uzbekistan]], a country in [[Central Asia]]. Formation and development of Modern architecture and town-planning of Uzbekistan historically shares for three periods:

==The First Period==

The first period – second half of 19th century – 1920s when a part of possession of [[Bukhara]] and all the lands of Kokand khanates were won by the Russian empire.

At the period ''traditional architecture'' and town planning developed in parallel with the ''Russian-European'' architecture.
Russian engineers and architects projected and built new cities, such as ''Skobelev'' (Fergana), Kagan, and new quarters in ''Tashkent'', ''Samarqand'', ''Andizhan''.

There were two-structural cities, ''Old'' and ''New'' cities&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/14778743/Modern_architecture_of_Uzbekistan Modern architecture in Uzbekistan is well-devepoled]&lt;/ref&gt; which were opposite on a development level. The old city represented a typical [[Central Asia]]n city with one-storied irregular buildings, with a labyrinth of streets, and the New city was built up by one-two-storied houses and had a regular planning, straight, planted and paved streets, sidewalks, arch network, etc.
There were new types of buildings, such as: banks, cinemas, railway stations, hospital and office building, etc., which ''architecture'' was planned in several style directions, beginning from eclecticism and gothic style up to modernism. Modernist style forms were widely applied basically in element variant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pagetour.org/wp/architecture-in-uzbekistan-past-and-present/ Details about the past and present time of architecture of Uzbekistan]&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of local traditional forms of monumental architecture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbektravel.com/eng/architecture2.htm The information on monumental architecture in Uzbekistan]&lt;/ref&gt; for buildings of new purposes (a cinema “[[Khiva]]”) is characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbektravel.com/eng/architecture2.htm Architectural works in Tashkent in current time]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Second Period==

The second period – the mid 1930s – 1991 formation of the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] – is searching and the statement of new socialist culture under rigid dictatorship of bolshevist-communistic ideology.

In architecture of public buildings one observes three stylistic directions: 
# constructivist
#: Examples: the House of government in Tashkent (1930), the State Bank in Andizhan (1928)
# imitation of classical samples
#: Examples: Office building on Pushkin street at Amir Temur square (1937)
# use of motifs of the Uzbek national architecture
#: Examples: “Vatan” cinema (1938), Uzbekistan pavilion at agricultural exhibition in Moscow (1939)

Creation of some state project institutes, the [[Tashkent]]  city architectural-planning department, ''Union of architects'' (1935) which united the republic creative power, and also opening of architectural branch (1929), later – faculty at technical colleges and nowadays at ''Tashkent Architectural Building Institute'' (which is most modern) was remarkable tendency at the time.

==The Third Period==

In 1941-1945 there were plenty of new problems: sharp growth of population, transfer of the industrial enterprises with the ''local personnel, shortage of buildings'',  materials especially ''wood'' and ''ferroconcrete'' materials. Despite severe conditions, the creative activity was proceeded (e.g. ''Mukimi'' theater, a three-story house on the bank of Anhor channel in [[Tashkent]] city, as well as new settlements in ''Chirchik'', ''Bekabad'' and others).

In post-war years a big updating is brought in the general layout of [[Samarqand]], [[Fergana]], [[Bukhara]], [[Kokand]], [[Khiva]], etc. taking into account new principles of planning, industrial methods of mass building, buildings of scientifically-methodical recommendations, unfortunately, it was insufficiently considered specific features of a southern city with its unique structure and environment. Principles of the European town-planning with huge open spaces, powerful transport arteries, many-storey apartment houses etc., aren’t always combined with traditional town-planning&lt;ref&gt;Traditional town-planning is taken from "Moziydan Sado" magazine,2003&lt;/ref&gt; culture – with necessity of shaded, half-opened spaces, scale internal inhabited environment and expedient neighborhood center.
Creative use of folk art methods, courageous processing of the classical order forms and other progressive receptions in building of the State academic [[Opera]] and ''Ballet'' Theater in Tashkent&lt;ref&gt;The information about history of Tashkent is written in "Toshkentnoma", Maqsud Shayhzoda&lt;/ref&gt;(constructed by A.Shchusev, 1947) rendered a great influence on a creative orientation of public building architecture in [[Uzbekistan]].

|author=Boswell, Wendy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each query also generates a "temporary" [[permalink]] (self-destructs in about one month) which can be used to recall the bibliography without reentering the ISBN data. The site is a [[metasearch engine]], integrating data from several sources, including the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] API, the [[Amazon.com]] database of books, and [[ISBNdb.com]]. OttoBib accepts ISBNs with either 10 or 13 digits.

== Background ==

OttoBib.com was started as a hobby project in 2006 by Jonathan Otto, a then 4th year undergraduate at the [[University of Wisconsin–La Crosse]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neobinaries.com/apps/Category/Search%20Engines/OttoBib.aspx Web 2.0 Application Listings] -- About the company&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally called "That's Crazy Hot!" but the name was quickly changed to OttoBib because the original title was "not suitable for the academic environment and consequently won't take off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jonathanotto.com/2006/1/13/21/55/Thats-Crazy-Hot | title = That's Crazy Hot! | date = January 13, 2006 | author = Jonathan Otto | work = OttoBib Blog | accessdate = 2007-02-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061101041332/http://jonathanotto.com/2006/1/13/21/55/Thats-Crazy-Hot &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original inspiration for the site came from [[Seth Godin]]'s January 3, 2006 blog post on "Stuck Systems", where he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A quick online search didn't turn up what seemed obvious to me: a free service that would allow a writer to type in all the ISBNs used in creating a paper and then generate two things:

# a bibliography based on looking up the data online and
# a web page that would allow the reader/teacher to see the books, their covers... etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/01/stuck_systems.html Stuck systems] January 3, 2006 post on [[Seth Godin]]'s Blog&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Functionality ==

OttoBib.com performs the two basic functions outlined.&lt;!--It does not seem to perform the second (it does via permalink)--&gt; Marcus P. Zillman, an Internet information retrieval consultant and speaker said "this website is the start of a new paradigm of citing sources."&lt;ref&gt;[http://zillman.blogspot.com/2006/12/ottobib-free-auto-bibliography.html Internet Happenings, Events and Sources] December 11, 2006 post by Marcus P. Zillman, accessed December 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason Clarke (writer)|Jason Clarke]], a writer and web developer, said OttoBib is a "tool that solves a simple problem in a simple manner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/09/20/ottobib-automatic-bibliographies-for-back-to-schoolers/ Downloadsquad review] posted Sep 20, 2006 by [[Jason Clarke (writer)|Jason Clarke]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==

In January 2007, OttoBib introduced a [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] interface to allow a citation to be generated from a URL that contains the ISBN.  For example, {{ISBN|0-19-511797-2}} can be used in the URL:

 http://ottobib.com/isbn/0195117972/apa

to display

 [[James T. Patterson (historian)|Patterson, J.]], (1997). ''[[Oxford History of the United States|Grand Expectations]]''. Oxford Oxfordshire: Oxford University Press.

In February 2007, OttoBib introduced the ability to request citations in [[BibTeX]] and Wikipedia {{tl|cite book}} formats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1538">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''p''-compact group}} 
In [[mathematics]], in particular [[algebraic topology]], a ''p''-'''compact group''' is (roughly speaking) a space that is a [[homotopical]] version of a [[compact Lie group]], but with all the structure concentrated at a single [[prime number|prime]] ''p''. This concept was introduced by Dwyer and Wilkerson.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Dwyer and C. W. Wilkerson, Homotopy fixed-point methods for Lie groups and finite loop spaces, Ann. of Math. (2) 139 (1994), no. 2, 395–442.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the name '''homotopy Lie group''' has also been used.

==Examples==

Examples include the [[p-completion]] of a compact and connected Lie group, and the [[Sullivan sphere]]s, i.e. the ''p''-completion of a [[sphere]] of dimension

:2''n'' &amp;minus; 1,

if ''n'' divides ''p'' &amp;minus; 1.

==Classification==

The classification of p-compact groups states that there is a 1-1 correspondence between connected p-compact groups, and [[root data]] over the [[p-adic integers]]. This is analogous to the classical classification of connected compact Lie groups, with the p-adic integers replacing the [[rational integer]]s.

'''Palmyrene funerary relief''' [[bust (sculpture)|busts]] were first produced in [[Palmyra]] in the middle of the first century CE as decorative slabs closing the [[Loculus (architecture)|burial niches]] inside [[Hypogeum|underground tombs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colledge|first1=Malcolm A.R.|title=The Art of Palmyra|date=1976|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder|isbn=9780891586173|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reliefs were carved into square pieces of [[limestone]] and depicted figures in a direct frontal pose cut off at mid-torso. Arms and hands were portrayed in various gestures and poses. Most busts display a solitary figure, however some sculptures incorporate multiple figures of family members. Names and lineage of the deceased are engraved in [[Aramaic]] above the shoulders, and in some cases, with [[Greek language|Greek]] &lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite web|title=Funerary monument of Aththaia, daughter of Malchos.

It is believed that Palmyrene funerary busts were created as symbolic decoration rather than portrayals of physical likeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyn|first1=Maura K.|title=Gesture and Identity in the Funerary Art of Palmyra|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=2010|volume=114|issue=4|page=634|jstor=25763805}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little individualization in the representation of figures, and like most ancient portraits the facial features are idealized. Male figures are depicted wearing a [[himation]] and [[chiton]]. The right arm is often wrapped in the himation with the hand placed on the chest. The left hand sometimes holds an attribute, often a scroll or leaf. Female busts are depicted wearing a [[tunic]], cloak and veil. The right hand is often raised to the chin or cheek, sometimes holding the veil. Some female figures are depicted with the left hand holding an attribute conveying domesticity, such as a spindle or distaff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyn|first1=Maura K.|title=Gesture and Identity in the Funerary Art of Palmyra|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=2010|volume=114|issue=4|page=635|jstor=25763805}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also instances where some female figures are portrayed holding a looped fold of the cloak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colledge|first1=Malcolm A.R.|title=The Art of Palmyra|date=1976|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder|isbn=9780891586173|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female busts were sometimes shown with an outward palm. This is believed to be a gesture to ward off evil or related to involvement in religious rituals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyn|first1=Maura K.|title=Gesture and Identity in the Funerary Art of Palmyra|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=2010|volume=114|issue=4|page=642|jstor=25763805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small-scale depictions of children are sometimes shown behind the parent.

Palmyrene funerary reliefs display a fusion of eastern and western influences. The busts mimic and display many features similar to [[Roman funerary art|Roman funerary reliefs]]. The static, frontal view of most busts is reminiscent of the frontality seen in ancient Egyptian [[Ka statue]]s. This connection to Egypt is further found in the methods of [[mummy|mummification]] used in Palmyrene funerary rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pettigrew|first1=Thomas Joseph|title=A History of Egyptian Mummies: And an Account of the Worship and Embalming of the Sacred Animals by the Egyptians|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0915431009|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are depicted in Greek himations and chitons. Male figures are often depicted with their right arm wrapped in the himation and their hand placed on their chest. This gesture is derived from Greek models. Persian and eastern influences are found in the large scaled eyes with two concentric circles to mark the pupils. These influences are also found in the ornate jewelry.
[[File:Damascus, National Museum, Hypogeum of Yarhai (6362299863).jpg|thumb|The [[Hypogeum of Yarhai]]. Damascus, Syria]]
Some variation in gestures and attributes allude to the individual’s profession, wealth, or family roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyn|first1=Maura K.|title=Gesture and Identity in the Funerary Art of Palmyra|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=2010|volume=114|issue=4|page=631|jstor=25763805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male figures with a scroll or leaf are common and convey very little about individual identity. However, rare depictions portray a sword or whip indicating a [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] trader.&lt;ref name="The Art of Palmyra"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colledge|first1=Malcolm A. R.|title=The Art of Palmyra|date=1976|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder|isbn=9780891586173|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priests are identified by their [[Modius (headdress)|modius]], a cylinder shaped cap, and are usually portrayed holding objects such as a jug or vessel.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Double portrait busts are sometimes depicted with one figure’s arm around the shoulder of the other alluding to family ties and affection between figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyn|first1=Maura K.|title=Gesture and Identity in the Funerary Arts of Palmyra|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=2010|volume=114|issue=4|page=637|jstor=25763805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several known double portrait busts depict a female figure with long hair, an exposed breast, and an arm over the shoulder of a male figure. These busts are believed to convey a wife mourning her deceased husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyn|first1=Maura K.|title=Gesture and Identity in the Funerary Art of Palmyra|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=2010|volume=114|issue=4|page=637|jstor=25763805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common theme for funerary reliefs is depicting favored objects and/or events that brought joy to the deceased during their lifetime.&lt;ref name="uses"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uses of Palmyrene Sculptures|url=http://arclab.usc.edu/palmyrene/html/Uses.html|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such as a funerary relief depicting a merchant alongside with his camel,&lt;ref name=uses/&gt; which shows that he had a very close tie with the animal whom he probably frequently travelled with, that he chose to be depicted and remembered with this animal in death.&lt;ref name=uses/&gt; Other examples of this are the funerary reliefs that depict certain family events favored by the deceased such as a meal or domestic settings portraying the family seated in their house reclining on a couch.&lt;ref name=uses/&gt;

While there was continuity in the overall model and structure of the funerary busts, stylistic changes occurred over time. The busts can be places into three groups based on Dr. Harald Ingholt’s 1928 chronological classifications: Group I (50-150 CE), Group II (15-200 CE), and Group III (200-273 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyn|first1=Maura K.|title=Gesture and Identity in the Funerary Art of Palmyra|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=2010|volume=114|issue=4|page=632|jstor=25763805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group I (50-150 CE): Early Palmyrene funerary busts are less naturalistic than later styles. The [[drapery]] is stylized and often includes patterns. Eyes are large and wide open with two concentric circles representing pupils. Male figures are beardless. Female figures wear austere clothing with little to no jewelry.

A more naturalistic style emerges in the depictions of eyes and wrinkles on brows. Pupils are sometimes marked by drilled holes. Drapery becomes softer and looser. Backgrounds emerge depicting camels and horses in busts of desert men.&lt;ref name="The Art of Palmyra"/&gt; Female figures are depicted with more exposed arms that are raised to touch the face or veil. More female figures begin wearing earrings, necklaces, rings, and bracelets.

It is common for their hands to hold their veils to display an increased emphasis on drapery.

Afte 273 CE, Palmyrene funerary reliefs ceased to be produced, due to the city's sack by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] which marked an end to its growth, development and wealth, and to its civilization altogether.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18777">[[File:AcademyOfMusic1870.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Academy of Music in Philadelphia.]]
The '''Philadelphia Grand Opera Company''' was the name of four different American [[opera]] companies active at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] during the twentieth century. The last and best known of the four was founded in November 1954 with the merger of the [[Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera Company]] and the [[Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company]]. That company in turn merged with the [[Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company]] in 1975 to form the [[Opera Company of Philadelphia]]. Of the three earlier companies, only one lasted beyond one season; a company founded in 1926 which later became associated with the [[Curtis Institute of Music]] in 1929. That company closed its doors in 1932 due to financial reasons during the [[Great Depression]].

==The first Philadelphia Grand Opera Companies:1916==
The first company to be known as the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company (PGOC) was founded in 1916. Its first production, [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'', opened on December 18 of that year at the Academy of Music with [[Regina Vicarino]] in the title role, [[Forrest Lamont]] as Edgardo, and [[Ettore Martini]] conducting. Short lived, the company produced one more opera in December 1916, [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Il trovatore]]'', before disbanding.&lt;ref name="PGOC"&gt;[[Free Library of Philadelphia]]: ''Folder: Philadelphia Grand Opera Company 1916&amp;ndash;1934 miscellaneous''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salmaggi's Philadelphia Grand Opera Companies:1920-1921==
The second company to be known as the PGOC was actually a company based out of New York City that was active in both NYC and Philadelphia. The company was founded by [[impresario]] [[Alfred Salmaggi]] (later founder of the [[Salmaggi Opera Company]]) in the spring of 1920 under the name the Italian Lyric Federation. The company's first performance at the Academy of Music was Verdi's ''[[Otello]]'' on June 30, 1920 with [[Nicola Zerola]] in the title role. The company changed its name to the PGOC in November 1920 after the financial backers fired Salmaggi. From this point on the company worked out of Philadelphia, although Salmaggi countered his firing by continuing to perform works with different singers under the name of the Italian Lyric Federation in NYC. Like the first PGOC, this company was also short lived, with its last production, ''[[Rigoletto]]'', being held on [[Halloween]] of 1921.&lt;ref name="PGOC"/&gt;

==The Hammer's Philadelphia Grand Opera Companies:1926-1932==
The third PGOC was founded in 1926 by [[Helen Redington Carter]], socialite wife of well known Philadelphia neurologist [[Joseph Leidy (neurologist)|Joseph Leidy]], [[William Carl Hammer]], an importer and trumpeter, and his wife, [[Kathryn O'Gorman Hammer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HBhehuI5dbEC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;dq=%22Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NRlEPa7ebT&amp;sig=ozVKDGEmq-SiWFQJl2NGywL_18Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0KRBSp2mM43GM7TTmcEH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5 Philadelphia: A Guide to the Nation's Birthplace By Federal Writers' Project at google books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1932/07/07/archives/dr-leidy-is-dead-eminent-pby5iciam-member-of-one-of-the-oldest.html?sq=%2522Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%2522&amp;scp=216&amp;st=p|title=DR. LEIDY IS DEAD; EMINENT PHYSICIAN; Member of One of the Oldest Families of Philadelphia Succumbs at 66. NEUROLOGIST OF HIGH RANK Medical Director and Instructor In Gas Defense for 30th Division In World War.|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=July 7, 1932| accessdate= June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the Hammers ran the business side of the company, with William running the Box Office and Kathryn hiring artists, putting together sets and costumes, and sometimes directing productions. Kathryn was a bandmaster and trombonist and she was notably the world's only female opera director at that time. Mrs. Leidy served as the opera board's president and provided a considerable amount of financial backing to get the company started. She also was able to get the opera house filled, being influential among Philadelphia's high society of the day.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,753128,00.html|title=Music: Philadelphia Curtain|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 2, 1931| accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the company's first year, the Hammers announced six performances for the first season.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; The company's first performance at the Academy of Music was a production of Verdi's ''[[Aida]]'' on October 28, 1926 with [[Vera Curtis]] in the title role, [[Jerome Uhl]] as the King of Egypt, [[John Sample]] as Radames, and [[Marta Wittkowska]] as Amneris. Other operas that season included ''Rigoletto'' with [[Millo Picco]] in the title role and [[Josephine Lucchese]] as Gilda, [[Charles Gounod]]'s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' with [[Charles Hart (tenor)|Charles Hart]] in the title role and [[Irene Williams]] as Marguerite, [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]'' with [[Robert Steel (baritone)|Robert Steel]] as Tonio and [[Euphemia Giannini Gregory]] as Nedda, ''Otello'' with Sample in the title role and [[Chief Caupolican]] as Iago, and ''[[Carmen]]'' with Wittkowska in the title role and [[Armand Tokatyan]] as Don José.&lt;ref name="PGOC"/&gt;

During the company's first three seasons the company was struggling to get by. Kathryn was able to save the company a lot of money by making the company's costumes from [[cheesecloth]] on her home sewing-machine and begging and borrowing sets and properties at bargain prices. Largely due to her shrewd efforts the company managed to stay in the black.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; The company opened its second season on October 20, 1927 with [[Amilcare Ponchielli]]'s ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]'', starring [[Clara Jacobo]] in the title role, [[Mignon Sutorius]] as Laura, {{Interlanguage link multi|Ivan Steschenko|uk|3=Стешенко Іван Никифорович|vertical-align=sup}} as Alvise Badoero, and [[Berta Levina]] as La cieca. Conductor [[Artur Rodziński]] joined the company that year and remained one of the PGOC's major conductors through 1929. Highlights of that second season included productions of [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[Tosca]]'' with [[Martha Attwood]] in the title role and [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' with [[Lisa Roma]] as Santuzza. Highlights of the 1928&amp;ndash;1929 season included [[Franco Leoni]]'s ''[[L’oracolo]]'' with {{Interlanguage link multi|Ivan Steschenko|uk|3=Стешенко Іван Никифорович|vertical-align=sup}} as Uin-Sci and [[Adamo Didur]] as Cim-Fen, [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]'s ''[[Samson et Dalila]]'' with Sample as Samson and [[Madame Cahier]] as Dalila, [[Jules Massenet]]'s ''[[Manon]]'' with [[Hope Hampton]] in the title role and [[Ralph Errolle]] as Des Grieux, [[Eleanor Painter]] as Carmen, ''[[Il trovatore]]'' with [[Frances Peralta]] as Leonora, and ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' with [[Josephine Lucchese]] as Rosina.&lt;ref name="PGOC"/&gt;

In 1929 a major [[Windfall gain|windfall]] came to the PGOC when [[Mary Louise Curtis Bok]] offered to support the company in exchange for using the company as an outlet for opera talent in the [[Curtis Institute of Music]]. The PGOC accepted the offer and a partnership was formed with Curtis students appearing mostly in minor roles with the company.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Plans were initially made to build a new $7,000,000 opera house for the company and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1927/10/15/archives/philadelphia-plans-a-new-opera-house-home-for-its-grand-opera.html?sq=%2522Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%2522&amp;scp=15&amp;st=p|title=PHILADELPHIA PLANS A NEW OPERA HOUSE; Home for Its Grand Opera Company and Orchestra May Cost $7,000,000|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=October 15, 1927| accessdate= June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, like many projects of the day, these plans were ultimately abandoned as a result of the financial crisis of the [[Great Depression]]. Bok's support, however, did manage to keep the company afloat longer than it probably would have, producing three more seasons of opera at the Academy of Music. Indeed, the company's two major rivals, the [[Pennsylvania Grand Opera Company]] and the [[Philadelphia Civic Opera Company]], both closed their doors not long after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].&lt;ref name="Time2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882402,00.html|title=Music: Up Go Curtains|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 3, 1930| accessdate= June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its remaining years the quality of PGOC's productions increased, particularly in regards to the sets and costumes. The quality of the singers remained high.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; A highlight of these years was the United States premiere of [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Wozzeck]]'' on March 19, 1931 with [[Ivan Ivantzoff]] in the title role, [[Anne Roselle]] as Marie, [[Gabriel Leonoff]] as the Drum Major, [[Sergei Radamsky]] as Andres, [[Bruno Korell]] as the Captain, {{Interlanguage link multi|Ivan Steschenko|uk|3=Стешенко Іван Никифорович|vertical-align=sup}} as the Doctor, and [[Leopold Stokowski]] conducting. Stokowski also conducted the world premiere of [[Carlos Chávez]] and [[Diego Rivera]]'s ballet ''[[H. P.]]'' for the PGOC on March 31, 1932. The company was also notably the first American company to perform [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' in the original German on October 29, 1931 with Roselle in the title role and [[Charlotte Boerner]] as Chrysothemis.&lt;ref name="PGOC"/&gt;

The PGOC's final performance was a production of ''Aida'' on April 14, 1932 with Roselle in the title role, [[Aroldo Lindi]] as Radames, [[Cyrena van Gordon]] as Amneris, and [[Leo de Hierapolis]] as the King of Egypt. The company closed due to financial reasons in 1932. At the time they canceled the end of the 1931&amp;ndash;1932 season and announced the intention of commencing another season for 1933-1934.&lt;ref name="NYT3"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1932/10/02/archives/opera-suspended-in-philadelphia-the-company-plans-to-present-next.html?sq=%2522Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%2522&amp;scp=220&amp;st=p|title=OPERA SUSPENDED IN PHILADELPHIA; The Company Plans to Present Next Season a New Form of "Drama With Music."|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=October 2, 1932| accessdate= June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That never happened, possibly because Mrs. Liedy and her husband both died in 1932.&lt;ref name="NYT8"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1933/02/10/archives/mrs-leidy-dies-opera-supporter-president-of-the-philadelphia-opera.html?sq=%2522Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%2522&amp;scp=229&amp;st=p|title=MRS.

==The last Philadelphia Grand Opera Companies:1954-1974==
The last company to be called the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company was formed in November 1954 when the [[Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera]] and the [[Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company]] merged. [[Anthony Terracciano]] served as the company's first General Director in its first season but was then succeeded by General Manager [[Humbert A. Pelosi]] who was appointed that position at the end of the 1955&amp;ndash;1956 season.&lt;ref name="NYT5"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20816FC345F177A93CAAB178FD85F428585F9|title=Pelosi Named Opera Manager|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=July 7, 1932| accessdate= April 28, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terracciano remained with the company as an Artistic Director through the Spring of 1972. Pelosi left in March 1956 after a feud with Terracciano. He was replaced by conductor [[Giuseppe Bamboschek]] who had been working for the company since it began.&lt;ref name="NYT6"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00813FB355A137A93C3AA1788D85F438585F9|title=Bamboschek Gets Post|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=March 31, 1957| accessdate= April 28, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamboschek remained the company's director until 1961 when Terracciano was again made General Manager by longtime friend and musical colleague, Max M. Leon, who was then the opera company's president. This time Terracciano stayed on until 1972.&lt;ref name="NYT9"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30F12FD3E5D1B728DDDA80B94DB405B818AF1D3|title=Terracciano to Head Opera|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=March 31, 1961| accessdate= April 28, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although formed in 1954, the company finished the 1954&amp;ndash;1955 season performing under the title of the Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company. The company's inaugural performance as the PGOC was of ''Rigoletto'' under the baton on Giuseppe Bamboschek on October 13, 1955 at the Academy of Music. The production starred [[Frank Guarrera]] in the title role, [[Lisa di Julio]] as Gilda, and [[Eugene Conley]] as the Duke of Mantua. Other productions that first season included Puccini's ''[[La bohème]]'' (with [[Rosanna Carteri]] as Mimì, [[Jan Peerce]] as Rodolfo, and [[Virginia MacWatters]] as Musetta), ''Faust'' (with [[Robert Rounseville]] in the title role, [[Nicola Moscona]] as Méphistophélès, and [[Ellen Faull]] as Marguerite), Puccini's ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' (with [[Licia Albanese]] as Cio-cio-san, [[Walter Fredericks]] as Pinkerton, [[Margaret Roggero]] as Suzuki, and [[Cesare Bardelli]] as Sharpless), [[Italo Montemezzi]]'s ''[[L'amore dei tre re]]'' (with [[Beverly Sills]] as Fiora and [[Ramón Vinay]] as Avito), ''Il barbiere di Siviglia'' (with MacWatters as Rosina, Guarrera as Figaro, and [[Cesare Valletti]] as Almaviva), ''Cavalleria rusticana'' (with [[Maria Gasi]] as Santuzza), ''[[Pagliacci]]'' (with Fredericks as Canio and [[Eva Likova]] as Nedda), and ''[[Aida]]'' (with [[Astrid Varnay]] in the title role, [[Kurt Baum]] as Radamès, [[Claramae Turner]] as Amneris, and [[John Lawler]] as the King of Egypt).&lt;ref name="PGOC2"&gt;[[Free Library of Philadelphia]]: ''Bound: Philadelphia Grand Opera Company 1955-1974''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philadelphia Grand Opera Company remained active for two decades, producing six operas during an annual season. The company notably presented the world premiere of [[Pietro Aria]]'s ''[[Jericho Road (opera)|Jericho Road]]'' on March 12, 1969. Many notable singers performed with the company during its history including, [[John Alexander (tenor)|John Alexander]], [[Thelma Altman]], [[Salvatore Baccaloni]], [[Cesare Bardelli]], [[Gaetano Bardini]], [[Daniele Barioni]], [[Ara Berberian]], [[Frances Bible]], [[John Brownlee (baritone)|John Brownlee]], [[Giuseppe Campora]], [[Richard Cassilly]], [[George Cehanovsky]], [[Anita Cerquetti]], [[Eugene Conley]], [[Fernando Corena]], [[Viorica Cortez]], [[Mary Costa]], [[Mary Curtis Verna]], [[Jon Crain]], [[Gilda Cruz-Romo]], [[Enrico di Giuseppe]], [[Mignon Dunn]], [[Pierre Duval (singer)|Pierre Duval]], [[Otto Edelmann]], [[Rosalind Elias]], [[Edith Evans]], [[Jean Fenn]], [[Giulio Fioravanti]], [[Nicolai Gedda]], [[Leyla Gencer]], [[Bonaldo Giaiotti]], [[Tito Gobbi]], [[Thomas Hayward (tenor)|Thomas Hayward]], [[Jerome Hines]], [[Laurel Hurley]], [[Raoul Jobin]], [[Robert Kerns]], [[Dorothy Kirsten]], [[Flaviano Labò]], [[Albert Lance]], [[Brenda Lewis]], [[Thomas LoMonaco]], [[Chester Ludgin]], [[Cornell MacNeil]], [[Jean Madeira]], [[Elaine Malbin]], [[Adriana Maliponte]], [[Susanne Marsee]], [[Robert Merrill]], [[Anna Moffo]], [[Licinio Montefusco]], Irene Kramerich, Sonia Leon, [[Barry Morell]], [[Nicola Moscona]], [[Herva Nelli]], [[Birgit Nilsson]], [[Roberta Peters]], [[Louis Quilico]], [[Luciano Rampaso]], [[Nell Rankin]], [[Regina Resnik]], [[Graciela Rivera]], [[Elinor Ross]], [[Jane Shaulis]], [[Giulietta Simionato]], [[Joanna Simon (singer)|Joanna Simon]], [[Eleanor Steber]], [[Teresa Stratas]], [[Brian Sullivan (tenor)|Brian Sullivan]], [[Giuseppe Taddei]], [[Ferruccio Tagliavini]], [[Pia Tassinari]], [[Blanche Thebom]], [[Giorgio Tozzi]], [[Norman Treigle]], [[Gabriella Tucci]], [[Richard Tucker]], [[Giuseppe Valdengo]], [[Frank Valentino]], [[Luigi Vellucci]], and [[Jon Vickers]] to name just a few. The PGOC's last performance was of [[Johann Strauss II]]'s ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' on December 6, 1974 with [[Joseph Venezia]] as Alfred, [[June Fiske]] as Adele, [[Eileen Schauler]] as Rosalinde, [[Robert Goodloe]] as Eisenstein, and [[Carlo Moresco]] conducting.&lt;ref name="PGOC2"/&gt;

In the companies last three years the opera board's long-term president, [[Max Leon]], served as the company's manager after the departure of Terracciano. Experiencing some financial difficulties, the company began talks with the [[Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company]] about a possible merger in 1974. An agreement was reached and the two companies merged to form the [[Opera Company of Philadelphia]] in 1975 with Leon serving as General Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/maxleon.html Biography of Max Leon at broadcastpioneers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[television pilot|pilot]] episode of the television series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' premiered on [[The CW Television Network|The CW]] on October 10, 2012. It was written by series developers [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Marc Guggenheim]] and [[Andrew Kreisberg]], and directed by [[David Nutter]]. The episode introduces [[Oliver Queen (Arrow)|Oliver Queen]] ([[Stephen Amell]]), a billionaire playboy, his mother [[Moira Queen]] ([[Susanna Thompson]]), sister [[Thea Queen|Thea]] ([[Willa Holland]]), new bodyguard [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]] ([[David Ramsey]]), best friend [[Tommy Merlyn]] ([[Colin Donnell]]), ex-girlfriend [[Laurel Lance]] ([[Katie Cassidy]]), and her father Detective [[Larry Lance|Quentin Lance]] ([[Paul Blackthorne]]). It follows Oliver as he returns to [[Star City (comics)|Starling City]], after having been shipwrecked for five years, and becomes a bow-wielding, hooded vigilante who sets out to right the wrongs of his father, who died during the shipwreck, and save the city.

Filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]], the pilot features two timelines on display: Oliver in the present, fighting crime, and Oliver when it is shipwrecked five years earlier. The developers wanted to bring a realistic vision to the character, which translated into a functional costume and no superpowers being featured. The pilot became the highest rated show on The CW in three years. It received generally favorable reviews from critics, who generally cited Amell's performance as a highlight. The episode was nominated for various awards, winning three.

== Plot ==
Billionaire playboy [[Oliver Queen (Arrow)|Oliver Queen]] is found on a remote Mandarin Pacific island of Lian Yu, having been shipwrecked for five years. Oliver is welcomed back home to [[Star City (comics)|Starling City]] by his mother Moira, stepfather Walter Steele, younger sister [[Thea Queen|Thea]], and best friend [[Tommy Merlyn]]. They can sense that Oliver has changed, and try to question him about his time on the island after viewing the numerous scars that have riddled his body.

As Oliver rejoins society, and Tommy attempts to update him on what has happened in the world the last five years, the two are abducted by a group of masked men. With Tommy unconscious, the group interrogates Oliver about his late father, Robert, and what he may have told Oliver before he died. Oliver escapes and he reveals his formidable combat capability to his captors, killing them to protect his secret from anyone. The police investigate the kidnapping, and Oliver informs Police Detective [[Larry Lance|Quentin Lance]], his former girlfriend [[Laurel Lance|Laurel]]'s father, that a man in a green hood saved them.

In response to the kidnapping, Moira orders Oliver to take on a bodyguard, [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]], for her own peace of mind, and his safety. Meanwhile, Laurel is revealed to be a lawyer currently working to bring a civil action against Adam Hunt, a man who collected millions of dollars from people living in the Glades, a small, crime-ridden neighborhood in Starling City. When Laurel discovered that Oliver is alive, the two meet. Oliver tries to apologize to Laurel for hurting her five years ago, as he was cheating on her with her sister [[Sara Lance|Sara]]. Laurel reminds him that his behavior not only broke her heart, but cost the life of Sara, who was on Oliver's sailboat ''The Queen's Gambit'' with him when it sank in sea.

Oliver quickly sneaks away from Diggle and begins building his new hideout base and training center at an abandoned Queen Industrial warehouse. As he prepares for his new alter ego as a green-hooded vigilante, Oliver reviews Robert's journal, which contains a whole list of names, needed to be crossed. Oliver decides to go after Hunt. Disguised in a green hood and leather outfit and armed with a bow and arrows, Oliver confronts Hunt and orders him to transfer $40 million into an account to be used to pay back the people of the Glades. When Hunt refuses, Oliver sends the transfer anyway before escaping as the police force arrives.

Later, it is revealed that Moira ordered Oliver's abduction so she could discover if Robert had told Oliver his secrets. In flashback sequences set during the shipwreck of the Queen's Gambit, Oliver recalls Robert sacrificing himself so that there will be enough supplies for Oliver to survive, asking him to correct the mistakes of the family and one day return home to Starling to save it.

===Conception===
On January 12, 2012, [[The CW]] began preparing a new series centered around the character [[Green Arrow]], developed by [[Andrew Kreisberg]], [[Greg Berlanti]] and [[Marc Guggenheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/01/12/green-arrow/|title='Green Arrow' TV series near pilot order at The CW!|last=Hibberd|first=Justin|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=January 12, 2012|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, the network ordered a [[television pilot|pilot]], now titled ''Arrow'', and brought in [[David Nutter]] to direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/01/18/green-arrow-tv-pilot-ordered-by-cw|title=Green Arrow TV Pilot Ordered by CW|last=Goldman|first=Eric|publisher=IGN|date=January 18, 2012|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When developing the series, producer Marc Guggenheim expressed that the creative team wanted to "chart [their] own course, [their] own destiny", and avoid any direct connections to ''Smallville'', which featured its own Green Arrow/Oliver Queen ([[Justin Hartley]]). They opted to cast a new actor in the role of Oliver Queen.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; Unlike with ''Smallville'', the pilot does not initially feature super-powered heroes and villains. Instead, the creative still took inspiration from ''Smallville'', as one of the main themes was to "look at the humanity" of Oliver Queen, as ''Smallville'' had done with Clark Kent. The decision not to include superpowers was, in part, based on the executives' desire to take a realistic look at the characters in this universe.&lt;ref name="IGNint1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Goldman|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/05/30/arrow-star-stephen-amell-talks-about-playing-tvs-new-oliver-queen|title=Arrow Star Stephen Amell Talks About Playing TV's New Oliver Queen|publisher=IGN|date=May 30, 2012|accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |quote = [[Amy Brenneman]] made a point of really befriending me before we started shooting [''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]''] [...] I was really taken with how she connected with me, person to person, before we tried to connect, actor to actor.  So, I made a real point to do that [with the ''Arrow'' cast] [...] I think that you can see that [we hit it off] [...] If you have to put your hand on somebody's shoulder, if you've done it before, it makes it easier to do. Sometimes it's imperceptible, but I think it's what takes things from good to great, or from 2D to 3D.

[[Stephen Amell]] was one of the first actors to audition for the role of Oliver Queen, and Kreisberg felt that he "hit the target from the outset" and "everyone else just paled in comparison".&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://o.canada.com/2012/10/11/stephen-amell-brings-arrow-to-small-screen/|title=Stephen Amell brings Arrow to small screen|publisher=canada.com|last=Strachan|first=Alex|date=October 11, 2012|accessdate=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Arrow''{{'}}s pilot script was the first Amell auditioned for during [[Television pilot#Pilot season|pilot season]], having received multiple scripts at the start of the year.&lt;ref name="Christina Radish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/stephen-amell-arrow-interview/201026/|author=Christina Radish|title=Stephen Amell Talks ARROW, How He Won the Role, the Evolution of the Queen Family Dynamic, Appearances by Other DC Characters, and More|publisher=Collider|date=October 8, 2012|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Producer Marc Guggenheim expressed that the creative team wanted to "chart [their] own course, [their] own destiny", and avoid any direct connections to ''[[Smallville]]'', which featured its own Green Arrow/Oliver Queen who was portrayed by [[Justin Hartley]]. Instead, they opted to cast a new actor in the titular role.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; Amell, who was already in shape from ''[[Rent-a-Goalie]]'', did physical fitness training at Tempest Freerunning Academy out of Reseda, California. He received archery training as well, which included watching a video on how archery has been displayed inaccurately or poorly in television and film before learning the basics of shooting a bow.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; For Amell, the appeal of portraying Queen was that he saw multiple roles tied to the same character: "There's Queen the casual playboy; Queen the wounded hero; Queen the brooding Hamlet; Queen the lover; Queen the man of action, and so on."&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt;

[[Katie Cassidy]] was cast as Dinah Laurel Lance on February 15, 2012; Laurel is also the vigilante [[Black Canary]] in the comic books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/16/katie-cassidy-cast-as-black-canary-in-arrow|author=Eric Goldman|title=Katie Cassidy Cast as Black Canary in Arrow|publisher=IGN|date=February 15, 2012|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cassidy said she was drawn to the show by Berlanti, Nutter, Kreisberg, and Guggenheim, whom she called smart, creative, and edgy.&lt;ref name="KCint2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenarrowtv.com/greenarrowtv-interview-with-katie-cassidy-laurel-lance/11422|title=GreenArrowTV Interview With Katie Cassidy, "Laurel Lance"|author=Craig Bryne|publisher=GreenArrowTV.com|date=August 7, 2012|accessdate=November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced in February 2012 that [[Colin Donnell]] was cast as Tommy Merlyn—a character whose surname is based on [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Green Arrow's nemesis]] in the comics—and [[David Ramsey]] would portray John Diggle, Oliver's bodyguard and a character not previously established through the comic books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2012/02/titus-welliver-to-star-in-nbcs-midnight-sun-cws-arrow-adds-colin-donnell-234108/#more-234108|title=Titus Welliver To Star In NBC's 'Midnight Sun', CW's 'Arrow' Adds Colin Donnell|author=Nellie Andreeva|publisher=Deadline|date=February 21, 2012|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2012/tv/news/ramsey-cast-in-cw-s-arrow-pilot-1118049941/|author=Stuart Levine|publisher=Variety|title=Ramsey cast in CW's 'Arrow' pilot|date=February 8, 2012|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramsey enjoyed the fact that he did not have to worry about matching the comic books.

However, when the character returned in the second season, Wood was replaced by [[Caity Lotz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/arrow-season-2-episode-4-reviews-black-canary-identity-revealed|title='Arrow': Black Canary Revealed – What Did You Think?|last=Yeoman|first=Kevin|date=2014|accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filming ===
Production on the pilot began in March 2012 in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cw-back-canada-a-slew-299086|title=The CW Back to Canada With a Slew of Drama Pilots|last=Vlessing|first=Etan|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 13, 2012|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series features two distinct timelines, which requires more specific planning in the filming schedule. Filming for the island flashbacks takes place in Vancouver's Whytecliff Park area, near beachfront homes. The production team is tasked with keeping the buildings out of camera frame.&lt;ref name="GKints"&gt;{{cite web|author=Craig Byrne|url=http://www.greenarrowtv.com/greenarrowtv-interview-talking-with-executive-producers-kreisberg-guggenheim/11399|title=GreenArrowTV Interview: Talking With Arrow Executive Producers Kreisberg &amp; Guggenheim|publisher=GreenArrowTV.com|date=August 1, 2012|accessdate=November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, producer Marc Guggenheim finds the process arduous: "Stephen [Amell] has to wear a wig, and his look has to be changed... there's a lot. It's actually incredibly ambitious to do these flashbacks every week, every single episode. Because like Andrew [Kreisberg] said, it's almost like it's its own show."&lt;ref name="GKints"/&gt; [[Hatley Park National Historic Site|Hatley Castle]], located in [[Royal Roads University]] was used for exterior shots for the Queen family mansion. Hatley Castle had previously been used as the Luthor ancestral home in ''[[Smallville]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael D.

=== Design ===
When it came time to design the look of the costume for Oliver Queen's vigilante persona, the studio brought in [[Colleen Atwood]] to develop a realistic approach to the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-arrow-stephen-amell-pilot-photo-301663|title=CW Fires Off First 'Arrow' With Pic From Comic-Inspired Pilot (Photo)|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 19, 2012|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Amell, it was important for the suit to be functional, and the best way that he knew for that was if he could put the costume on by himself: "If I can put it on by myself, I think that people will buy it. And that was our idea. That's our world."&lt;ref name="IGNint1"/&gt;

[[File:Stephen Amell 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Amell (on set) was praised by multiple critics for his ability to portray the various sides of Oliver Queen convincingly.]]

===Critical response===
The pilot episode received generally favorable reviews upon release. ''[[Newsday]]''{{'}}s Verne Gay commended the series' start, specifically the casting of [[Susanna Thompson]] as Moira Queen and the pilot's ability to weave in the action with "a pleasing romantic triangle, interfamily intrigue, a flawed hero and [...] a mystery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/arrow-is-off-to-a-fast-start-1.4089299|author=Verne Gay|title=''Arrow'' is off to a fast start|publisher=''Newsday''|date=October 9, 2012|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Hiltbrand, of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', characterizes the pilot as a "dark, gleaming gem", but acknowledges that the show's success will be built around how well it maintains the quality of the action sequences and the mystery behind Oliver's motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-10-10/entertainment/34343934_1_stephen-amell-oliver-queen-green-arrow|author=David Hiltbrand|publisher=''The Philadelphia Inquirer''|title=Arrow, Nashville produce welcome pilots late in the game|date=October 10, 2012|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[NY Daily News]]''{{'}} David Hinckley praised the start of the series as being "lively" and "better than hard-core 'Green Arrow' fans expected"; Hinckley also pointed out that Amell does a good job of finding the proper balance for Oliver as he moves between his "old world" and "new world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/tv-review-arrow-article-1.1178324?localLinksEnabled=false|publisher=''NY Daily News''|author=David Hinckley|date=October 10, 2012|title=TV Review: 'Arrow'|accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''{{'s}} [[David Wiegand]] favorably compared the pilot to ''Smallville'', stating that the series is fun and action-packed, and worth the same level of longevity that ''Smallville'' received. Weigand praised Amell's performance and his ability to convincingly portray both the spoiled billionaire and his vigilante alter-ego, and gives credit to director David Nutter and the editors for putting together an episode that built suspense and kept the action fast and believable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/tv/article/Beauty-and-the-Beast-Arrow-reviews-3932630.php|publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle''|author=David Wiegand|title=''Beauty and the Beast'',''Arrow'' reviews|date=October 9, 2012|accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Bianco, of ''[[USA Today]]'', characterized the pilot as a ''Dark Knight'' version of the Green Arrow character. Bianco praised the action sequences, the emotional development with the characters, and the mystery of the plot. He contends that the biggest hurdle to ''Arrow''{{'}}s success will be the network in which it airs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2012/10/09/bianco-review-cw-arrow/1622941/|author=Robert Bianco|publisher=''USA Today''|title='Arrow': Great aim, but not quite a bulls-eye|date=October 9, 2012|accessdate=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Brian Lowry also said the pilot felt more like a lite version of [[Christopher Nolan]]'s [[The Dark Knight Trilogy|''Dark Knight'' saga]], but believed the action could not hide the two-dimensional characters that were introduced. Lowry further commented that the series would have an "uphill climb" when it comes to mainstream appeal because of the "second-tier" nature of its primary comic book character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Lowry|url=https://variety.com/2012/tv/reviews/arrow-1117948503/|publisher=''Variety''|title=''Arrow'' Review|date=October 8, 2012|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Tim Goodman stated, if you can get past the implausibility, ''Arrow'' is entertaining and matches the type of brand ''The CW'' is creating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Goodman|publisher=''The Hollywood Reporter''|title=Arrow: TV Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com//review/arrow-tv-review-375856|date=October 3, 2012|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Rodman, of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', also said the pilot was cartoonish, specifically commenting on Amell's "stilted narration" and the storyline feeling "silly". She further stated that pilot would please fans of the genre, and drama fans who can [[suspension of disbelief|suspend their disbelief]] that an alcoholic billionaire "driven mad on a remote island for five years would now know how to hack computers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/2012/10/09/arrow-falls-short-bullseye/r1BsuzTM8jDY923XdlOJFI/story.html|author=Sarah Rodman|publisher=''Boston Globe''|title='Arrow' falls short of a bullseye|date=October 9, 2012|accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
The pilot won multiple [[Leo Awards]], including Best Cinematography in a Dramatic Series ([[Glen Winter]]), Best Production Design in a Dramatic Series (Richard Hudolin), and Best Stunt Coordination in a Dramatic Series (J.J. Makaro).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leoawards.com/past_winners/winners_by_name_2013.php|title=Leo Awards Past Winners 2013|publisher=LeoAwards.com|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glen Winter was also nominated for an award based on his work in the pilot episode by the [[Canadian Society of Cinematographers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csc.ca/CSCawards/2013/|title=Leo Awards Past Winners 2013|publisher=Canadian Society of Cinematographers|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artwork "will make architecture performative."&lt;ref name="artforum1"&gt;"http://artforum.com/words/id=23335"&lt;/ref&gt; It is literally a ground-shifting exercise, because it structurally involves the rotation, back to front, of a single-family, ranch-style house and its surrounding land in the development of [[Sharpstown]], a suburb of [[Houston]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Texas, an Artist Plans to Rotate a House 180 Degrees |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/garden/07qna.html?_r=1 |work=The New York Times |date=October 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rio Grande Glaze Ware''' is a late prehistoric and historic pottery tradition of the [[Puebloan peoples]] of New Mexico. The tradition involved painting pots with black paint made with lead ore; as the pots were fired the black paint fused and sometimes ran. The tradition lasted from AD 1315 to 1700. Rio Grande Glaze Ware was made or used in a number of villages from the Santa Fe area to the north end of Elephant Butte Reservoir, and from the valley of the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande)|Rio Puerco]] east to the upper Pecos River Valley.

Archaeologists divide Rio Grande Glaze Ware into arbitrary types with much shorter life spans, primarily to help them date sites. Individual [[Sherd|potsherds]] are assigned to types based on a combination of attributes, beginning with vessel rim profiles and proceeding to painted designs or vice versa.

==Overview and cautions==

Rio Grande Glaze Ware was first made about AD 1315 (based on [[Dendrochronology|tree-ring]] dating at Tijeras Pueblo). It partly displaced an earlier tradition of [[Rio Grande white wares|black-on-white pottery]] and was inspired by the White Mountain Red Ware tradition (Carlson 1970) centered on the upper Little Colorado drainage of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico. The apparent ancestral type for Rio Grande Glaze Ware, Los Padillas Polychrome, was a local variant on a White Mountain Red Ware type, Heshotauthla Polychrome (Wilson 2005:43). Los Padillas is found at sites dominated by [[black-on-white]] decorated pottery (Mera 1935:33), a pattern predating the glazeware tradition, and Wilson (2005:43) dates Los Padillas from AD 1175 to 1300. Habicht-Mauche (1993, Table 2) dates it from AD 1300 to 1350, however. The type is sometimes called Los Padillas Glaze Polychrome.

Rio Grande Glaze Ware was fired in an oxygen rich atmosphere. The lead-based pigment yielded a black glazing paint despite the presence of oxygen, while iron-based, non-glazing pigment yielded a matte red paint. Red design elements were most often outlined in black. On most pots, background colors ranged from red to olive to yellow, achieved with clay slips containing iron. A white slip was sometimes achieved by using slip clay imported from the Acoma-Zuni region to the west.

Rio Grande Glaze Ware was no longer made after 1700, because the Spanish cut off Pueblo access to the lead ore used in making the glaze paint (Wilson 1995:10). The Pueblos continued to make polychrome pottery but used all matte paints (Harlow 1973), as they do today.

The ware was made in the [[Rio Grande]] Valley and adjacent valleys, from roughly Santa Fe south to the north end of Elephant Butte Reservoir, and from the Rio Puerco east and northeast to the upper Pecos River. Unlike Old World glazed pottery and its derivatives, Rio Grande Glaze Ware used the glaze material as part of a decorative scheme, never to coat and waterproof the entire vessel.

Spielmann (1998) argues that the new pottery was part of changing religious practices
among the New Mexico Pueblos, and specifically that "large glaze ware bowls were used ... for
communal feasting, with each household contributing to the feast. The smaller white ware bowls
continued to function as vessels for domestic food consumption. During the fifteenth century,
white ware bowls were replaced by a smaller form of the Rio Grande glaze ware bowl, and thus
glaze ware bowls came to be used in both ceremonial feasting (large size bowl) and domestic food
consumption (small size bowl)" (Spielmann 1998:258).

Archaeologists divide Rio Grande Glaze Ware into a number of [[Typology (archaeology)|types]], primarily to estimate the age of a site (based on what pottery types were found there). In this article the first approach to the named types begins with rim profiles. It is followed by a breakdown that begins with paint styles. Both approaches can be useful in understanding why a specific piece of pottery was assigned to a specific type. What follows is not an exhaustive typology (those can be found in the references provided). Rather, it is just extensive enough to allow non-specialists to understand the existing named distinctions.

==Approach based on rims==

The most time-sensitive attribute of Rio Grande Glaze Ware pottery is the rim profiles of bowls, so most archaeologists sort potsherds beginning with the rims. In doing so they refer to Glaze A through Glaze F pottery, A rims being the earliest and F rims being the latest (Hawley 1950; Wilson 2005). This letter-based key was first developed by Harry Percival Mera (1933), drawing on an earlier, number-based key developed by [[Anna O. Shepard]] and [[Alfred V. Kidder]] (Kidder and Shepard 1936). Here, the first question is: what rim profile is present?

===Glaze A===

[[Image:Rio grande a rims.GIF|thumb|upright|Profiles of Glaze A rims]]
Glaze A bowl rims are in-curving and of a consistent thickness. The lips are rounded or squared. Glaze A is often dated from AD 1315 to 1425 (Wilson 2005:47), but the end date applies only from the Albuquerque area north. In the southern part of the range, bowls with Glaze A rims were made until AD 1500 or later (Franklin 2007).

Glaze A pottery was first made in the Albuquerque area (the earliest directly dated examples being from Tijeras Pueblo) and was dominated by red-slipped examples with black interior designs. The exteriors are sometimes painted with isolated elements such as crosses. Pottery of this description is classified as Agua Fria Glaze-on-red. In some of the earliest examples, however, simple white paint designs appear on the exterior; such pottery is classified as Arenal Glaze Polychrome (with crushed rock temper) or Los Padillas Polychrome (with sherd temper) (Wilson 2005:47&amp;ndash;48).

As Glaze A pottery spread north, yellow-slipped examples appeared and are known as Cieneguilla Glaze-on-yellow. Yellow-slipped pottery with red matte paint elements outlined in black glaze paint are known as Cieneguilla Glaze Polychrome (Wilson 2005:49&amp;ndash;50).

On some Glaze A pottery, the interior slip color differs from the exterior slip color (so that the background colors are different on each side of a potsherd). If the painted design was executed with black glaze paint, the type is known as San Clemente Glaze Polychrome. If the design also includes red matte paint elements (usually outlined in black), the type is known as [[Pottery Mound]] Polychrome (Wilson 2005:51&amp;ndash;52).

Although most Glaze A rims were quite simple, one contemporary variant has a slightly flaring rim (Honea 1966).  Examples with one slip color are classified as Sanchez Glaze-on-red or Sanchez Glaze-on-yellow. Examples with contrasting white (interior) and red (exterior) slips, and with black glaze paint, are termed Sanchez Glaze Polychrome (Wilson 2005:52&amp;ndash;54).

===Glaze B===

&lt;!--Tried setting image to thumb, looked awful, reverted to fixed size--&gt;
[[Image:Rio grande b rim.GIF|thumbnail|right|100px|Profile of Glaze B rim]]
Glaze B bowl rims are also incurving but become thicker towards the lips, which are flat. The resulting profile is somewhat wedge-shaped. Glaze B was made almost exclusively in the region north of Albuquerque; farther south, potters simply continued with the Glaze A rim style. Glaze B dates between AD 1400 and 1450 (Wilson 2005:55).

Glaze B vessels with one slip and black glaze paint are classified as Largo Glaze-on-yellow or Largo Glaze-on-red, the yellow-slipped type being more common. Examples with one slip, and red matte paint outlined in black, are classified as Largo Glaze Polychrome. In this type, the lower portions of bowl exteriors are often unslipped (Wilson 2005:55&amp;ndash;57).

Rarely, examples are found with two contrasting (interior versus exterior) slip colors and black glaze paint designs; these are termed Medio Glaze Polychrome.

===Glaze C===

&lt;!--Tried setting image to thumb, looked awful, reverted to fixed size--&gt;
[[Image:Rio grande c rim.GIF|thumbnail|right|100px|Profile of Glaze C rim]]
Glaze C bowl rims have everted lips. Glaze C was made between AD 1425 and 1500. This rim group has one named type, Espinoso Glaze Polychrome, which includes red matte paint elements outlined in black glaze paint. The contrast between the red paint and the other colors give Espinoso pots a "gaudy" look. Jar necks are near-vertical and display red designs outlined in black. The bottom of vessel exteriors may be unslipped. In the Glaze C through E periods, vessel designs were almost exclusively polychrome (Wilson 2005:57).

===Glaze D===

&lt;!--Tried setting image to thumb, looked awful, reverted to fixed size--&gt;
[[Image:Rio grande d rims.GIF|thumbnail|right|100px|Profiles of Glaze D rims]]
Glaze D bowl rims date between AD 1470 and 1515. In profile, rim exteriors exhibit an inward bend (or close to it). The rims themselves are either fairly consistent in thickness, or taper slightly to both the body and the lip. This rim group has one named type, San Lazaro Glaze Polychrome, which includes red matte paint elements outlined in black glaze paint. Some examples lack the red matte paint but are also classified as San Lazaro. Bowl interiors and exteriors both have designs in panels or bands. The black paint is thin but non-runny (Wilson 2005:58).

===Glaze E===

&lt;!--Tried setting image to thumb, looked awful, reverted to fixed size--&gt;
[[Image:Rio grande e rims.GIF|thumbnail|right|120px|Profiles of Glaze E rims. L-R: Pecos, Puaray, Escondido]]
Most Glaze E bowl rims are substantially thicker than the bodies of the bowls, and "breaks" (discontinuities) in the exterior curve of the bowl are common. After the Spanish colonized New Mexico in 1598, some glaze ware bowls took on distinctly European shapes, for example, soup plates. Glaze E black paint ran during firing. Glaze E was made from 1515 until 1700 (Wilson 2005:59).

Glaze E bowl rims fall into three named categories. Puaray Glaze Polychrome is characterized by thickened rim profiles reminiscent of willow leaves, above a marked break in the exterior profile. The designs included red matte paint elements outlined runny black (or off-black) glaze. When the rims are instead somewhat rectangular in profile, the type becomes Escondido Glaze Polychrome. In the Pecos Pueblo area, Glaze E rims are sometimes instead somewhat "stubby," meaning that the break is near the rim, and that the thickened portion of the rim is correspondingly short. This variant is known as Pecos Glaze Polychrome (McKenna and Miles 1996; Wilson 2005:59&amp;ndash;61).

===Glaze F===

&lt;!--Tried setting image to thumb, looked awful, reverted to fixed size--&gt;
[[Image:Rio grande f rim.GIF|thumbnail|right|100px|Profile of Glaze F rim]]
"Glaze F ... exhibits a significant decline in the glaze and quality of workmanship" (Wilson 2005:62). Glaze F bowl rims retain a break in the exterior profile, but the marked thickening of Glaze E disappears. European-inspired shapes become more common. The glaze paint then in use usually fired to runny brown or green rather than black.

Glaze F vessels with one slip and "black" glaze paint are classified as Kotyiti Glaze-on-red or Kotyiti Glaze-on-yellow. Several design variants are subsumed by Kotyiti Glaze Polychrome. Some examples of that polychrome type have one slip color and red matte paint elements outlined in "black" glaze paint. Others have two slip colors and either "black" glaze paint examples or red-and-black paint examples (Wilson 2005:62).

==Approach based on paint styles==

Under the Mera system of classification, all types based on painting styles fit neatly as subtypes of the types based on rim forms. In practice, specific painting styles do not form neat subsets of groups defined on rim forms, particularly in the southern portion of the production range. Here, the first question is: does the painted design consist of black elements, or of red and black elements?

===Black painted designs===

The first examples of Rio Grande Glaze Ware carried on a centuries-old tradition of black painted designs on a lighter background. The next question is: was the slipped background (1) red, (2) yellow, or (3) contrasting colors, one on the inside of the vessel, the other on the outside?

====Red slip backgrounds====

[[File:Los Padillas Polychrome Bowl.gif|thumb|right|Los Padillas Polychrome bowl]]
Arenal Glaze Polychrome and Los Padillas Polychrome feature red-slipped bowls with simple interior designs painted in black glaze paint; the former has crushed rock temper while the latter has crushed sherd temper. The bowl exteriors include simple designs in white matte paint. The overall layout (black-on-red interiors, white-on-red exteriors) is a carryover from White Mountain Red Ware. Arenal dates from AD 1315 to 1350(?) and is found from Albuquerque south&amp;mdash;the same area of its supposed ancestor, Los Padillas Polychrome.

Agua Fria Glaze-on-red lacks white paint on bowl exteriors, but is otherwise identical to Arenal. Agua Fria bowls are red-slipped. The black glaze paint is usually dull and non-runny. The black designs are usually laid out in bands on the upper part of bowl interiors. The upper exteriors sometimes have slashes, crosses, or similar isolated motifs. Jars with black-on-red exterior designs also occur. Agua Fria Glaze-on-red occurs throughout the Rio Grande Glaze Ware area. It dates from AD 1315 to 1425 throughout its range, and later (possibly as late as 1550) in the southern portion of its range. Honea (1966) describes a variant of Agua Fria Glaze-on-red with a slightly out-flaring rim, Sanchez Glaze-on-red. This type is found north of Albuquerque and dates from AD 1350 to 1425.

[[File:Kotyiti Glaze Bowl.gif|thumb|right|Kotyiti Glaze-on-red bowl]]
When B rims rather than A rims are present, this type becomes Largo Glaze-on-red (AD 1400 to 1450). Afterwards, all-black painted designs appear to have given way to black-and-red painted designs until the Spanish Colonial period, when some vessels revert to this simpler design scheme. During the Spanish Colonial period, when F rims are present, this type becomes Kotyiti Glaze-on-Red (AD 1625 to 1700).

====Yellow slip backgrounds====

When the slip is more yellow than red, black-design vessels are called Cieneguilla Glaze-on-yellow. This style is found north of Albuquerque and may represent a local innovation as the making of glaze ware pottery spread northward. Cieneguilla dates from AD 1325 to 1425. In the [[Galisteo Basin]], a variant of this type with a slightly flaring lip is known as Sanchez Glaze-on-yellow (Honea 1966) and dates from AD 1350 to 1425.

When B rims rather than A Rims are present, black-on-yellow bowls are classified as "Largo Glaze-on-yellow." This type dates from AD 1400 to 1450. Afterwards, all-black painted designs appear to have died out until the Spanish Colonial period, when some vessels revert to this simpler design scheme. During the Spanish Colonial period, when F rims are present, the named type is Kotyiti Glaze-on-yellow (AD 1625 to 1700).

====Contrasting slip backgrounds====

Early on, potters also learned to make some vessels with contrasting slips&amp;mdash;one background color on the inside of the vessel, a different background color on the outside. The options included the red and yellow slip clays used on one-slip vessels, as well as white slip clay probably imported from the west.

San Clemente Glaze Polychrome dates from AD 1315 (?&amp;mdash;this is probably too early) to 1425. In this type, the interior and exterior of each bowl is slipped in a different color. (In jars, the uppermost and most easily reached part of the interior is slipped a different color.) The black glaze paint design applied over the slip often includes dots and serrated lines. San Clemente Polychrome occurs from Albuquerque south.

Honea (1966) has described a variant on San Clemente Glaze Polychrome, Sanchez Glaze Polychrome. The Sanchez variant has a "slightly out-flaring rim resembling Glaze C rims, but thicker" (Wilson 2005:54). This rare variant consists of bowls, which are found north of Albuquerque.

Late in the sequence, a variant appears in which black paint designs appear over contrasting interior and exterior slips, with Glaze F rims. This combination is called Kotyiti Glaze Polychrome, however, the same name is used for F rim examples with red-and-black painted designs (see below).

===Red and black painted designs===

Almost immediately, it seems, the Rio Grande area potters branched out from black-design tradition of White Mountain Red Ware, adding a scheme involving black and red paint designs on a lighter background. Where red (matte) paint was used, it was almost always outlined in black glaze paint. This specific artistic canon may have been inspired by Ramos Polychrome, a type of pottery made in northwest Chihuahua beginning about 1200. The next question is: was the slip background (1) a single color (which could vary), or (2) contrasting colors?

====Single background colors====

The use of red-and-black painted designs apparently began on vessels with yellow slips, but as time went on other slip colors were used. The probable first type in this tradition was Cieneguilla Glaze Polychrome, which differs from Cieneguilla Black-on-yellow by the addition of red (matte) paint elements outlined in black (glaze) paint. Cieneguilla Polychrome dates from AD 1325 to 1425. When B rims rather than A rims are present, this type becomes Largo Glaze Polychrome (AD 1400 to 1450).

When C rims are present, the type becomes Espinoso Glaze Polychrome (AD 1425 to 1500). By Espinoso, the slip tends to be off-white rather than yellow, causing the designs to appear more "gaudy." This background color may be in imitation of contemporary Acoma-Zuni wares. Espinoso Glaze Polychrome is most common north of Albuquerque.

When D rims are present, the type becomes San Lazaro Glaze Polychrome (AD 1470 to 1515). The background slip color reverted to a tan-reddish continuum. In some instances the red matte paint was not used, and strictly speaking those examples are glaze-on-red designs, not polychrome.

[[File:Puaray Glaze Polychrome.gif|thumb|Puaray Glaze Polychrome jar neck and upper shoulder]]
When E rims are present, the type becomes Puaray Glaze Polychrome (willow-leaf profiles; AD 1515 to 1650) or Escondido Glaze Polychrome (rectangular profiles; AD 1515 to 1650[?]). (Jars, such as the one shown, have different rims and are always classed as Puaray rather than as Escondido.) The background slip color ranges from an off-white to yellow or red. By this point the black glaze paint is "runny" (during firing), giving the finished vessels a sloppy look. It is not clear whether the runny look is deliberate (due to a change in the paint formula) or unavoidable (due to a change in the available raw minerals). In the area, a local variant, Pecos Glaze Polychrome, has "stubby" thickened rims; this variant dates from AD 1515 to 1700.

When F rims are present, the type becomes Kotyiti Glaze Polychrome (AD 1625 to 1700),  however, the same type name is applied to F rim examples in the San Lazaro (two slip) tradition. Kotyiti Glaze Polychrome is characterized by slapdash designs and by the use of runny glaze black paint.

====Contrasting background colors====

[[Image:Pottery Mound Polychrome Jar Sherd.gif|thumb|[[Pottery Mound]] Glaze Polychrome Jar Sherd]]
Pottery Mound Polychrome is considered a variant of San Clemente Glaze Polychrome, in the sense that the San Clemente slip scheme (different slip color on interiors and exteriors) is combined with the canon of red matte paint outlined in black glaze paint. In some of the most boldly executed examples of this type, however red matte paint designs are sometimes not framed in black. The background colors used in contrasting pairs include red (grading to orange), yellow (grading to olive), and white (probably using slip clay from the Acoma area, in imitation of Acoma-Zuni wares). Pottery Mound Polychrome dates from AD 1400 to 1490. The sole center of production was [[Pottery Mound]], a village on the lower Rio Puerco (east).

Eckert (2003, 2006) breaks this pottery into two types. She uses "Pottery Mound Polychrome" to describe A rim bowls slipped yellow to buff on the interior surface and red on the exterior surface, and dates the type from AD 1375 to 1450 or later. She uses "Hidden Mountain Polychrome" for A or C rim bowls are slipped red on the interior surface and white on the exterior surface, and dates the type from AD 1400 to 1450 or later. By her standards, the bowl sherd with a C rim shown here is Hidden Mountain Polychrome, not Pottery Mound Polychrome.

==Tabular approach to classification==

[[Image:Pottery mound glaze polychrome bowl sherd with C rim.gif|thumb|Pottery Mound Glaze Polychrome bowl sherd with C rim]]
The Mera system, which first keys off rim profiles, is probably best suited to the northern portion of the glaze ware production area&amp;mdash;in other words, in the area Mera relied on to develop his system. One recently developed alternative approach, by Franklin (2007), reflects work in the southern portion of the glaze ware area, where the Mera system works less well. Franklin's system recognizes the cross-cutting nature of rim forms and painted designs in the Rio Grande Glaze Ware. In his system, therefore, a bowl with black glaze paint on a red slip background is classified "Agua Fria Glaze-on-red" regardless of rim form, and the rim forms (A, B, etc.) are separately recorded for the sherds thus classified. One advantage of this approach is its flexibility. In Wilson (2005), for example, Pottery Mound Polychrome is listed as a Glaze A type but at the production center, [[Pottery Mound]], it occurs with other rim forms (Franklin 2007).

'''''Rough Sea at a Jetty''''' (c. 1650s) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[Kimbell Art Museum]].

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1911, who wrote; "945. A ROUGH SEA, [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm. 2.]] A storm is coming on. In the 
centre foreground the waves dash on two jetties. Near a beacon at the end of one jetty, two men with long poles wait to help a fishing-boat 
which is running under full sail for the harbour. Two other boats ride at anchor near the jetty, to the right. Dark cloudy sky. A " magnificent 
picture " (Sm.). Canvas, 37 inches by 51 inches. 

Another example, equally genuine, was in the possession of the London dealers Agnew. Exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] Winter Exhibition, London, 1884, 
No. 191. Sales. Antony Sijdervelt, Amsterdam, April 23, 1766 (Terw. 519), No. 49 (250 florins, Loquet).

This scene is very similar to other paintings Ruisdael made in this period and these often served as inspiration for later painters of seascape.

'''Sexual tension''' is a social phenomenon that occurs when two individuals interact and one or both feel [[sexual desire]], but the [[consummation]] is postponed or never happens. A common scenario is where the two individuals function in close proximity, such as co-workers or in a group of friends, but do not have sex to avoid awkwardness or for other reasons. Sexual tension doesn't have anything to do with the actual act of sex but is everything that leads up to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Palmquist|2012|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual tension can also occur when two individuals have previously had [[human sexual activity|sexual relations]] and still feel an attraction towards each other, but do not wish to have sex again for fear of its effect on their current social situation (such as maintaining a relationship with a different partner). It can also be felt in situations when two individuals have a relationship devoid of physical contact, as in a long-distance relationship.

Sexual tension often occurs between individuals when the relationship is close and often flirtatious, yet the two people involved adamantly deny their feelings for each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://expertdaconquista.com/aprenda-criar-tensao-sexual/|title=Aprenda A Criar Tensão Sexual - Expert da Conquista|date=2016-03-18|language=pt-BR|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, it can appear extremely obvious to other friends or co-workers that such tension is present between the two individuals. When people give in to sexual tension, the relationship can become complicated and awkward if no new relationship level is established, as the relationship that existed before is no longer valid.

== In fiction ==
Sexual tension is a common feature in works of [[fiction]]. This longing is often suggested by incidents of [[intimacy]]; for example, when two characters are alone and in close proximity (or actually touching), yet desire is never explicitly expressed. Another common theme is for characters to develop an interest in each other over the course of the story, and if this is expertly done, the audience can become aware of the growing attraction.

Sexual tension intensifies the audience's involvement with all characters involved. However, as several television series have discovered to their sorrow, tension dissipates when characters come together in sexual harmony. It is not like violence, which establishes the villain's credibility and makes the next round of jeopardy even more powerful. Instead, sexual fulfillment has the same effect on sexual tension that the death of the victim has on jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Card|2010|pp=93–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The private Society was founded in 1866 by [[Francisco Asenjo Barbieri]] and [[Joaquín Gaztambide]], who assumed responsibility for its organization and artistic direction.  It was the heir of the orchestra formed by the [[Sociedad Artístico Musical de Socorros Mutuos]] which was based at the [[Teatro Real]] in [[Madrid]].

Barbieri [[conducting|conducted]] the Orchestra during its inaugural season and was succeeded by Gatzambide in the following.  The first musical director who served at length was [[Jesús de Monasterio]], who was appointed in 1869 and remained until 1876.  The Orchestra divided its activities between theatrical productions and symphonic concerts, and contributed to the spread of [[Richard Wagner#Wagner.27s influence and legacy|Wagernism]] and European symphonic music in Spain.  It advanced the careers of new Spanish talents, such as [[Tomás Bretón]], [[Joaquín Turina]], [[Ruperto Chapí]], and [[Isaac Albéniz]].

In 1876, the conductorship passed to [[Mariano Vázquez Gómez]], under whose guidance the Orchestra offered Spanish audiences the chance to hear the complete cycle of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[symphony|symphonies]] in their homeland for the first time.

On 27 February 1898, the Orchestra gave a performance [[Richard Strauss]]' [[symphonic poem]] ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'' at the [[Teatro Príncipe Alfonso]] on the [[Paseo de Recoletos]], which was conducted by the composer himself.  Other famous conductors who were invited to the Orchestra included [[Luigi Mancinelli]] and [[Jerónimo Giménez]].

Due to a major economic crisis and irreconcilable disagreements between the section leaders of the Orchestra, the Society was dissolved in 1903.  The majority of its members regrouped to form the [[Orquesta Sinfónica de Madrid]], which has continued to play to the present day.

==Principal conductors==
*[[Francisco Asenjo Barbieri]] 1866–1867
*[[Joaquín Gaztambide]] 1868–1869
*[[Jesús de Monasterio]] 1869–1876

==Narrative==
{{expand section|date=April 2013}}
The principal characters Dave (David Toole) and Eddie (Eddie Kay) are out of work performers in a seaside resort at the end of the summer. Dave is a double amputee dancer determined to keep his independence in spite of his disability, Eddie is a tough, aggressive character who believes in justice and respect. Through a series of scenes and dances Dave and Eddie encounter and interact with other people living on the fringe of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.barbican.org.uk/education/event-detail.asp?ID=6249 |title=The Cost of Living (15*), followed by Man on the Moon (12A*) |publisher=Barbican |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The film was well received by critics and also won a number of awards at film festivals in various countries.

===''[[New York Times]]''===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is a piece about something, and someone, who is great, about what a profound pleasure it is to encounter greatness, and about what a persistent concern it is that we live in a culture, more specifically a dance culture, that resists such greatness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nearly every scene strikes the heart: Eddie's disruption of a brilliantly choreographed six-clown routine; his caustic hostility to gays; Eddie and Dave looking down on a lawn at two women dancers prancing on the green; Dave giving a sexual come-on to an imaginary woman in a pub; Dave verbally harassed by a man with a video camera, followed by a swaying fantasy dance, echoed by the other dancers; Rowan's first encounters with the hula-hooper (Kareena Oates), and their growing romance, all done with silence and hoops; Dave's fluid floor-dance with a woman in a dance studio; and the astonishing final scene, with Eddie and Dave on the beach, speculating about moving to New York and making it on the club circuit.&lt;ref name="nytimes2005"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''[[The Guardian]]''===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There was an unexpected outbreak of artiness on Channel 4 on Sunday night, when DV8 Physical Theatre were given 45 minutes of post-pub screentime to air a mixed-media piece, The Cost of Living. Despite a few annoying moments involving masks, this was a very beautiful mishmash of dance and dialogue set on the north Norfolk coast, featuring a man with no legs who danced on his hands, an aggressive Scottish man who danced like an elegant Bez, and a really awesome routine to Cher's Believe. The piece came to Channel 4 laden with awards, and it's not hard to see why - it was beautiful, provocative, political and erotic. It was probably watched by two people and a dog, but it almost made me want to forgive Channel 4 for Big Brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rupert Smith |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/may/30/tvandradio.comment1 |title=Saturday night's all right |publisher=The Guardian |date=2005-05-30 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''[[Now (newspaper)|Now Magazine]]''===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This entertaining look at what happens after a group of street performers give up their clown work in a British seaside town makes it clear that live or on celluloid, DV8 are one of the sharpest dance troupes around.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The movement arises out of character and situation, whether it’s a guy in a nightclub whose nervous tics take over his body, or a woman fighting off a group of boys with a hoola hoop.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It’s an ensemble piece, but the film’s most memorable moments involve David Toole , a legless dancer who seduces us in a bar, fights off a bigot, gets to dance with a ballerina and shares the film’s extraordinary final image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sumi |first=Glenn |url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/stage/story.cfm?content=144400 |title=Living well &amp;#124; NOW Magazine |publisher=Nowtoronto.com |date=2004-11-04 |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The First Grader''''' is a 2010 [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Justin Chadwick]]. It stars [[Naomie Harris]], [[Oliver Litondo]], and [[Tony Kgoroge]]. The film is based on the true story of [[Kimani Maruge]], a [[Kenya]]n farmer who enrolled in elementary school at the age of 84 following the Kenyan government's announcement of free universal primary education in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/movies/the-first-grader-justin-chadwicks-tale-of-kenyan-culture-review.html?ref=movies&amp;_r=0 | title = Simple Quest for Literacy Hits a Wall of Politics | work = A.O. Scott | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2015-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Plot==
In 2003, a disc jockey announces over a Kenyan radio station that the government is offering free primary school education to all natives who can prove citizenship with a birth certificate. Kimani Maruge (Litondo), an 84-year-old villager, hears this and decides to take it upon himself to seek an education. Arriving at his local school, he meets Jane Obinchu (Harris), the principal and teacher. He expresses his desire to learn how to read. Her teaching colleague Alfred (Munyua), ridicules him and demands he leave. Later, Jane informs her husband Charles (Kgoroge) about Maruge. He discourages her in supporting his educational endeavor. 

After beginning his initial classes, Maruge is plagued by memories of his service during the [[Mau Mau Uprising]] against the British in the 1950s. He begins to hallucinate and becomes confrontational with the students, struggling to continue his academics. Controversy begins to stir over Maruge’s education. Soon enough, the story that an elderly man going to school becomes national headlines. Mr. Kipruto (Kunene), a superintendent of the school district, is alerted to the situation and strongly disapproves of Maruge's predicament and suggests that he go to an adult educational facility.

Meeting with the head of the education board to plead Maruge’s case, Jane is overruled. It is explained to her that if an exception is made to keep Maruge in the school, others will follow, and many schools will eventually become filled with older people sitting aside children. Maruge is forced to attend an adult learning centre, where he soon finds himself surrounded by people with no motivation or ambition to study. Maruge vows to never go back to the adult institution. Jane later decides to offer him a reprieve, to work as her teaching assistant. As Maruge's story gains publicity and attention, the local press descend on the school, causing friction among the parents. The villagers believe Jane and Maruge are seeking fame and fortune at the expense of the children. Following negative feedback and random acts of violence against the school, Jane soon receives a letter that she is to be transferred to another educational institute a few hundred miles away.

Jane reveals to Maruge that she is relocating, and then commences an emotional goodbye with the children. Following protests and disobedience on part of the students towards their new teacher, Maruge is motivated to travel to Nairobi to appeal himself to the education board. Jane is reinstated at the school, where Maruge and the children are there to welcome her. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics stating that at age 84, Maruge is the oldest person to start primary school according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Supplementally, he was invited to make a speech before international leaders at the [[United Nations|UN]] in New York regarding the power of education. He inspired a whole new generation of people to go to school for the first time. Maruge later died in 2009.

US based film producer [[Sam Feuer]] found the story on the front page of the LA Times and optioned the rights. He, and then, producing partner Richard Harding, partnered with BBC Films and hired Ann Peacock to write the screenplay. The British produced film was shot on location in the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Rift Valley]] in Kenya, despite earlier reports that it would be filmed in [[South Africa]]. Director Chadwick conveyed, "We could have shot it in South Africa, but Kenya has this unbelievable, inexplicable energy inherent in the children, and the people we were making the film about".&lt;ref&gt;Interview with director Justin Chadwick, reproduced by Soda Pictures.

'''''The Hunt in the Forest''''' (also known as '''''The Hunt by Night''''' or simply '''''The Hunt''''') is a painting by the Italian artist [[Paolo Uccello]], made around 1470. It is perhaps the best-known painting in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]], England.

The painting is an early example of the effective use of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in [[Renaissance]] art, with the hunt participants, including people, horses, dogs and deer, disappearing into the dark forest in the distance. It was Uccello's last known painting before his death in 1475.

== In popular culture ==
The painting is featured in the "Point of Vanishing" episode of the British TV series ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]''. A postcard of the painting is discovered as a clue to a murder. Lewis and his colleague visit the painting at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] on more than one occasion and are instructed on its significant features by a museum expert. The painting provides Lewis with an insight that allows him to solve the case.

[[John Fowles]] mentions the painting twice, in ''[[The Ebony Tower]]'' and ''[[The Collector]]'': "...the design hits you the moment you see it.  Apart from all the other technical things.  You know it's faultless."

'''''The Last Supper''''' (1480) is a [[fresco]] depicting the [[Last Supper]] of Jesus by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artist [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]; it is located in the refectory of the Convent of the [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti]] on Borgo Ognissanti #42 in central Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. It is one of three Last Supper frescoes painted by Ghirlandaio in Florence, the others being for the [[Badia di Passignano]] (1476) and for the ''Cenacolo di [[San Marco, Florence|San Marco]]'' (1486).

==History==
The layout of the scene resembles that seen in the [[Last Supper (del Castagno)|Andrea del Castagno's ''Last Supper'']] frescoed some 3 to 4 decades earlier for the refectory of Sant'Apollonia in Florence, wherein the apostles sit in a shallow U-shaped setting, with only the two flanking apostles sitting at a 90 degree angle with the others. John the Apostle at Christ's left has fallen to sleep. Judas sits apart on the near side of the table, as is common in early depictions of the [[Last Supper in Christian art]].  However, in this depiction, the upper register is not interior, but opens up into the tree-line orchard with birds. The halos of the apostles have narrowed into thin circles; and the apostles cast shadows. St Peter and another apostle appear to challenge Judas.

[[File:Domenico ghirlandaio, cenacolo di ognissanti 04.jpg|thumb|240px|Detail of the fresco]]
Ghirlandaio was well known when he received the commission for this fresco, and soon after its completion, he was called to Rome to help decorate the walls Sistine Chapel. It is likely that [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was familiar with this treatment of the subject, as well as that of [[Andrea del Castagno|Castagno]], and painted his own Last Supper in a more dramatic form to contrast with the stillness of these works, so that more emotion would be displayed.&lt;ref&gt;''Leonardo da Vinci, the Last Supper: a cosmic drama and an act of redemption'' by Michael Ladwein 2006 page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

During the restoration of this fresco later, a preliminary sketch of it was discovered on the left wall of the refectory in Cenacolo di Ognissanti.

'''''The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien''''' is a selection of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s letters published in 1981, edited by Tolkien's biographer [[Humphrey Carpenter]] assisted by [[Christopher Tolkien]]. The selection contains 354 letters, dating between October 1914, when Tolkien was an undergraduate at Oxford, and 29 August 1973, four days before his death.

==Categories==

The letters can be roughly divided in four categories:
#Personal letters to Tolkien's wife Edith, to his son Christopher Tolkien and his other children,
#Letters about Tolkien's career as a professor of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]]
#Letters to his publishers at [[Allen &amp; Unwin]] explaining his failing to meet the deadline and related topics
#Letters about [[Middle-earth]]

The last category is especially of interest to Tolkien fans, as it provides a lot of information about Middle-earth which cannot be found anywhere in the works published by Tolkien himself.

==Notable topics==

===Nazi racial politics===
In letters 29 and 30, it appears that a German [[translation]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' was being negotiated in 1938. The German firm enquired whether Tolkien was of ''Arisch'' ([[Aryan]]) origin. Tolkien was infuriated by this, and wrote two drafts of possible replies for his publisher to choose.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Carpenter: ''The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien'', Editorial comments at the head of ''Letter 30''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first one is not present – in it Tolkien is assumed to have refused to give any declaration whatsoever of his racial origins. The second, surviving, draft included:

{{Quote|Thank you for your letter ... I regret that I am not clear as to what you intend by ''arisch''. I am not of ''Aryan'' extraction: that is Indo-Iranian; as far as I am aware none of my ancestors spoke Hindustani, Persian, Gypsy, or any related dialects. But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of ''Jewish'' origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have ''no'' ancestors of that gifted people.|Tolkien|The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, #30 (Emphasis in original)}}&lt;!-- See also [[Aryan]] and [[Talk:Aryan]] --&gt;

===War===
A former [[Military communications|signals]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] at the [[Battle of the Somme]], Tolkien frequently expressed his great dislike for war, whatever the cause. This is evident in a great many letters which he wrote during the Second World War to his son Christopher, which often invoke a sense of gloom. Notable among these is his reaction to the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], in which he refers to the bombmakers of the [[Manhattan Project]] as "[[lunatics]]" and "[[Tower of Babel|Babel]] builders".

'''V-shaped passage graves'''  are a type of [[megalithic]] [[chamber tomb]] found in parts of [[Atlantic Europe]] including [[Ireland]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. They date to between 3500 and 2500BC.

They are similar to [[Wedge-shaped gallery grave]]s in that in plan they have a narrow entrance that widens out inside into a burial chamber. The entrance passage and the burial chamber are distinguished by [[sill plate|sill]] stones however meaning that they are part of the [[passage grave]] tradition. 

In some cases a small sub chamber leads off from the main chamber.

Examples include [[La Varde]] and [[Le Creux es Faies]] on [[Guernsey]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6313">'''Virgilius the Sorcerer''' is a [[fairy tale]] about the poet [[Virgil]] by [[Andrew Lang]] who included it in ''[[The Violet Fairy Book]]''.

==Virgil's powers==
Medieval legends attributed [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers to the poet [[Virgil#Mysticism and hidden meanings|Virgil]], but even among these legends, this tale attributes a very high level of power to him.

Among his accomplishments in the tale, Virgilius is a quick thinker, using his magical powers to defeat corruption and military attacks and spirits. One of his spells was to make an army immobile, turn men to stone, or create a river out of nowhere, encircling them so they could not proceed. Although he wins many challenges, including a magician's battle, wily schemes also help his cause. Among his creations, he invents and animates a horse, rider and dogs out of copper to assert his will.

Virgilius avenges the trickery of his first love for publicly humiliating him before finding true love at last, and creating the city of [[Naples]] for her.

==Synopsis==
The story begins –
&lt;blockquote&gt;Long, long ago there was born to a Roman knight and his wife Maja a little boy called Virgilius. While he was still quite little, his father died, and the kinsmen, instead of being a help and protection to the child and his mother, robbed them of their lands and money, and the widow, fearing that they might take the boy's life also, sent him away to [[Spain]], that he might study in the great University of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One holiday, when walking, he came upon an evil spirit that was trapped; the spirit offered him magical books in exchange for setting him free. Virgilius demanded the books, and the knowledge how to use them, first; then he freed the spirit. It grew to an enormous size, so the quick-witted Virgilius declared he did not believe it came out of the hole, and the spirit, to prove it, went back in whereupon Virgilius quickly trapped it again.

He studied magic for many days gaining a wonderful reputation for his powers ("he was much thought of as showing promise of great learning"). This was cut short when his mother sent for him because she was ill and could no longer look after their affairs. When he arrived home, his rich relatives were displeased because his presence meant they could no longer rob their kinsmen. They were, however, related to the emperor, who put off the matter of giving Virgilius his due. His enemies attacked him but Virgilius used his magic to drive them off or cast spells on them. The emperor himself went to him without effect until a magician came into camp and was hired to battle Virgilius. Virgilius had a hard time fighting the magician, but reached the emperor in secret with a proposition: he would stop the fight if he could have justice, compelling the emperor to agree.

Virgilius then fell in love with a woman named Febilla. She told him that she would let him visit her by drawing him up in a basket to a tower. Once he was in the basket, she lifted it only half way, leaving him a dangling target of the crowd's ridicule. The emperor ordered his release, but the next day, no fire in Rome would light. Virgilius told them to bring Febilla to a scaffold in the market place and take fire from her. Fire started about her and she had to stand there until everyone had re-lit their fires. The emperor threw Virgilius into prison with a death sentence,  but when he was brought up, thirsty Virgilius asked for water. When the guards brought him a pail of water, Virgilius jumped into it, saying he was going to Sicily and magically vanished.

Andrew Lang has heavily bowdlerized his sources here; in the original Medieval tradition, the fire could only be rekindled from her vagina. The story was very popular with Renaissance artists. The [[Metropolitan Museum]] has a Venetian ''confittiera'' (ca. 1475&amp;ndash;1500) showing Febilla standing on the square with raised skirt, a gift by [[J. Pierpont Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/arlo/ho_17.190.730a,b.htm Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://alaintruong.canalblog.com/archives/2008/11/23/11465448.html Les cahiers d'Alain Truong]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on Rome===
The fairy tale says that it is unknown how he reconciled with the emperor, but he next made statues of the gods of every country, including Rome, with bells in their hands, and the bells would ring if they intended treachery toward Rome, so the Romans would send their armies against them. 

A country that hated them sent men to Rome; they claimed to be diviners and to have dreamed of gold, and then, with the Senate's permission, dug up the gold they had buried the night before. The [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] time, they told the Senate it was under the Capitol and they would dig for them, for their generosity; they undermined the Capitol and stole away. Immediately after, the statues fell and were ruined.  

Much crime followed in the city. Virgilius had a copper horse and rider made and ordered all men indoors. Only the honest obeyed, and the horse trampled those it found outside. The next day, the surviving thieves tried to use ropes and grapples to stop it, and used rope ladders to escape it. Two copper dogs were added, to jump up and bite them to death.

Virgilius fell in love with a foreign princess, the daughter of a sultan, and carried her away from her father. She was a guest in his house, wondering at the marvels, until she wished to return to her father. Virgilius returned her, but the sultan ordered his death. Virgilius cast a spell on him and his court and carried the princess away again. Then, thinking Rome not fine enough, he built a marvelous city for her, which was [[Naples]].

==Commentary==
The technique of tricking  spirit is a motif also found in ''[[The Spirit in the Bottle]]'' and with genies in ''[[The Fisherman and the Jinni]]''.

The legend that he had been trapped in a basket was a common medieval tale, warning of the power of love to make fools of men.

There is a reference to the "Black Book" he uses as the source of his spells which in popular culture can be a book containing lists or evil deeds.

The '''Winged Lion of Vulci''' is a [[nenfro]] sculpture of a lion with wings, carved between 550 BC and 540 BC and discovered in excavations of the [[necropoli]] of the [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] city of [[Vulci]]. It is now in the [[Louvre]].

Inspired by both ancient Greek and ancient Near East models, it is one of many such sculptures discovered in the excavations and intended for the entrances to tombs and funerary chambers.
