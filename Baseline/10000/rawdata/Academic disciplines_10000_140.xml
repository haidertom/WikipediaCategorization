      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7454">'''Amani Research Institute''' is a [[research institute]] located in [[Amani Nature Reserve|Amani]] of the [[Muheza District]], in the [[Usambara Mountains]] of the northeastern region in [[Tanzania]], in tropical [[East Africa]].

==History==

===German East Africa===
Also known as Amani Institute, the research institute was founded in 1902 by German colonists in [[German East Africa]] (''Deutsch-Ostafrika''). It was established under the leadership of Dr Frantz Stuhlmann, who was in charge of the Department of Surveying and Agriculture (est. 1893) of German East Africa.

The Amani Institute started out as a biological-agricultural research centre, and came to be known as the Amani Biological-Agricultural Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, W.O.; "German East Africa 1884 – 1918," in Vincent Harlow, E.M. Chilver, Alison Smith, eds., ''History of East Africa, II'', London: Oxford University Press, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ref. note #1: Henderson, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;134.&lt;/ref&gt; But it quickly expanded into other areas of research in the following years. "The Amani Institute soon became a 'tropical scientific institute superior to anything in the British colonies and protectorates and comparable with Pusa in India or the Dutch establishment at Buitenzorg in Java." &lt;ref&gt;Report of the East Africa Commission'', Cmd. 2387 (1925), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ref. note #2: Henderson, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;144.&lt;/ref&gt;

During their reign, the Germans had other research centres in the colony, especially in the northern region. "Although Amani was the most famous of Germany's colonial research stations, representing a 2-million-mark investment, it was only one of several German agricultural stations in the northern region. Another, named Kwai farm and located in the nearby West Usambaras, preceded Amani as the colony's chief center for agricultural and livestock experiments. Kwai lacked Amani's international reputation, but it nonetheless held a prominent place in the minds of the Africans who lived in its shadow." &lt;ref&gt;Conte, Christopher-Allan; "Imperial Science, Tropical Ecology, and Indigenous History: Tropical Research Stations in Northeastern German East Africa, 1896 to Present," in Gregory Blue, Martin Bunton and Ralph Croizier, eds., ''Colonialism and the Modern World: Selected Studies'', New York: M. E. Sharpe, Inc., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conte, Christopher-Allan; ''Highland Sanctuary: Environmental History in Tanzania's Usambara Mountains'', Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ref. note #3: Conte, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;246 – 247; Conte, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans built other facilities, including schools and hospitals, in different parts of the country while ruling the colony (1891–1918). One of their biggest colonial achievements was in scientific research at the institutes they established in German East Africa, especially at Amani.

===British Tanganyika===
The German East Africa colony was renamed [[Tanganyika Territory]] in 1920 when the British took over, by a [[League of Nations]] Mandate, after the [[German Empire]] lost World War I. Other areas of research were added to the institute in 1960.

Although the Amani Research Institute became world-famous during German colonial rule as a scientific research centre,&lt;ref&gt;Ref. note #6: Conte, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;246; Conte, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt; it retained its international reputation after the British received control of the colony they renamed [[Tanganyika]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Mwakikagile|Mwakikagile, Godfrey]] ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'';  Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: New Africa Press, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;164: "The Amani Research Institute....was established by the German colonial rulers and became world-famous as a tropical research institute."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence===
In 1964, liberated [[Tanganyika]] united with [[Zanzibar]] to form the independent nation of [[Tanzania]]. After British colonial rule ended, the institute continued to play an important role as a research centre in Tanzania.

In 1977, it was renamed Amani Medical Research Centre of the National Institute for Medical Research, covering a wide range of areas in medical research.

==Achievements==
During [[World War I]], the Amani Research Institute reinforced its international reputation in research when scientists at the centre developed various products. They included medicine and chemical products, from local material to meet war needs and those of the German settlers at a time when the colony was cut off from the rest of the world and could not import anything:

"Considerable ingenuity was shown in producing in the colony manufactured goods and medical supplies normally imported from Europe. Quinine was made at the Amani Institute and at [[Mpwapwa]]....Dye-stuffs were made from native barks. In the first eighteen months of the war the Amani Agricultural Research Institute 'prepared for use from its own products 16 varieties of foodstuffs and liquors, 11 varieties of spices, 12 varieties of medicines and medicaments, 5 varieties of rubber products, 2 of soap, oils and candles, 3 of materials used in making boats, and 10 miscellaneous substances. Many of these were prepared in comparatively large quantities, e.g.15,200 bottles of whisky and other alcoholic liquors, 10,252 lb. of chocolate and cocoa, 2,652 parcels of toothpowder, 10,000 pieces of soap, 300 bottles of castor oil etc.' &lt;ref&gt;''Report of the East Africa Commission'', Cmd. 2387 (1925), p. 86....Owing to the blockade, overseas trade came to an end....The long drawn-out conflict inflicted serious damage on the colony."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.O. Henderson, "The war economy of German East Africa, 1914 - 1917," ''Economic History Review'', xiii, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ref. note #5: Henderson, 1965, pp.&amp;nbsp;160 – 161; Henderson, 1943, pp.&amp;nbsp;104 – 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the British took over, they were "impressed both with Amani's international reputation and the quality of research conducted there...and continued operating it as a research institute under the British postwar government. Amani therefore continued to function as an important center of botanical research and became a flash point for arguments over the value of pure versus applied research in Britain's East African colonies." &lt;ref&gt;Ref. note #6: Conte, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;246; Conte, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute also became famous for its research in malaria during British colonial rule and was transformed in 1949 into the East African Malaria Unit. The research centre served not only Tanganyika but also [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Zanzibar]] and [[British Somaliland]] in the prevention and control of malaria and other vector-borne diseases. It became the East African Malaria Institute in 1951 and was renamed the East African Institute of Malaria and Vector Borne Diseases in 1954.

In the present day it maintains a high reputation in research, as the Amani Medical Research Centre, in the [[Tanga Region]] of Tanzania.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5334">The '''Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act''' of 1998 is an [[Alabama]] statute that criminalizes the sale of [[sex toy]]s.  The law has been the subject of extensive litigation and has generated considerable national controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Jay. Women Fight Alabama Sex Toy Ban, ''Chicago Sun Times'', Feb 18, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Federal Judge Overturns Alabama's Sex Toy Ban, ''The New York Times, March 30, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== The statute ==

The statute was originally sponsored by State Senator [[Tom Butler (Alabama politician)|Tom Butler]] of [[Madison, Alabama]] as a measure to prohibit nude dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Challen.  Sex toys never 'focus of bill'. ''Huntsville Times'', May 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  It prohibits "any person to knowingly distribute, possess with intent to distribute, or offer or agree to distribute any obscene material or any device designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs for any thing of pecuniary value."&lt;ref name="Code of Alabama"&gt;[http://law.onecle.com/alabama/criminal-code/13A-12-200.2.html Code of Alabama - Title 13A: Criminal Code - Section 13A-12-200.2 - Distribution, possession with intent to distribute, production, etc., of obscene material prohibited; penalties; distribution of fines]&lt;/ref&gt; First-time offenders face a $10,000 fine and a year in prison, while repeat offenders can face up to ten years in prison.&lt;ref name="Code of Alabama"/&gt; Exemptions exist for "bona fide medical, scientific, educational, legislative, judicial or law enforcement purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Challen. State set to enforce ban on sex toys, ''Huntsville Times'' Oct 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The law's most outspoken backers have been a coalition of [[Christian right|Conservative Christians]] led by Dan Ireland of the Alabama Citizens' Action Program.  Ireland has defended the law on the grounds that "laws are made to protect the public" and "sometimes you have to protect the public against themselves."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lyman, Brian. Ban on sex toys targeted. ''Mobile Register'', Dec. 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal challenges ==

Sherri Williams, an adult novelty dealer, and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] challenged the statute on constitutional grounds.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-02-22-toys_x.htm High court declines to review Alabama's sex-toys ban] ''USA Today'', February 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the precedent of ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', finding a right to engage in consensual homosexual sex, also guaranteed a right to sell sex toys.  After initially winning their case, ''Williams vs. Alabama'', in federal district court, Williams lost appeals to the [[11th Circuit Court of Appeals|11th Circuit]].&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/30/us/national-news-briefs-federal-judge-overturns-alabama-s-sex-toy-ban.html National News Briefs; Federal Judge Overturns Alabama's Sex Toy Ban], ''The New York Times'', March 30, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;   The Supreme Court refused to hear the case.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;

Ross Winner, the owner of Love Stuff, a chain store which sells sex toys, subsequently sued to have the statute declared unconstitutional under the Alabama Constitution.  Winner's position is that "a person should have the ability to come in and purchase a sexual device without having to have a reason."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs42.com/content/localnews/story/Love-Stuff/rDqpEplHt0iO3X6ibdiLXA.cspx Love Stuff] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718230109/http://www.cbs42.com/content/localnews/story/Love-Stuff/rDqpEplHt0iO3X6ibdiLXA.cspx |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Alabama Supreme Court ruled against him on September 11, 2009, and the statute's ban is now in effect.

[[Alabama House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[John Rogers (Alabama politician)|John Rogers]] of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] has repeatedly introduced legislation to repeal the ban, but each bill has been defeated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, adult toys continue to be sold as novelty and educational items. Adult clothing is marketed as costumes.

== Public reaction ==

San Francisco radio personality Big Joe Lopez held a protest outside the federal courthouse in Huntsville, Alabama, giving away sex toys to passersby.&lt;ref&gt;Faulk, Kent.  San Francisco Radio Personality Protests Sex Toy Ban, ''Birmingham News'', Feb. 23, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toy drive ===

In 2007, Alabama politician [[Loretta Nall]], a former [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] candidate for governor, launched a well-publicized "toy drive" to send sex toys to Alabama Attorney General [[Troy King]], a staunch defender of the law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Autoconstructive evolution''' is a process in which the entities undergoing evolutionary change are themselves responsible for the construction of their own offspring and thus for aspects of the evolutionary process itself.  Because [[biological evolution]] is always autoconstructive, this term mainly occurs in [[evolutionary computation]], to distinguish [[artificial life]] type systems from conventional [[genetic algorithms]] where the GA performs replication artificially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ekárt|first=Anikó|date=2014-03-01|title=Emergence in genetic programming|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10710-013-9199-4|journal=Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=83–85|doi=10.1007/s10710-013-9199-4|issn=1389-2576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Miller |first=Julian F. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFJROKdtvC0C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Autoconstructive&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV2t2vwrDWAhVKKyYKHc_1DYA4ChDoAQglMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Autoconstructive&amp;f=false |title=Cartesian Genetic Programming  |date=2011 |pages=10 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=3642173101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Rahim|first=Adzni Abdul|title=A parametric study on reproductive competence in auto-constructive artificial life|date=2008|degree=Masters|publisher=Universiti Malaysia Sabah|url=http://eprints.ums.edu.my/9406/|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.563.9564|title=Proceedings of the Evo20 Workshop, AISB|last=Ryser-welch|first=Patricia|last2=Miller|first2=Julian F.|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=A review of hyper-heuristic frameworks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahim|first=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1500">A '''binary constraint''', in [[mathematical optimization]], is a constraint that involves exactly two variables.

For example, consider the [[n-queens problem]], where the goal is to place ''n'' [[Queen (chess)|chess queens]] on an ''n''-by-''n'' chessboard such that none of  the queens can attack each other (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).  The formal set of constraints are therefore "Queen 1 can't attack Queen 2", "Queen 1 can't attack Queen 3", and so on between all pairs of queens.  Each constraint in this problem is binary, in that it only considers the placement of two individual queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Programming with Constraints: An Introduction|first1=Kim|last1=Marriott|first2=Peter J.|last2=Stuckey|publisher=MIT Press|year=1998|isbn=9780262133418|page=282|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBYAleHTldsC&amp;pg=PA282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linear program]]s in which all constraints are binary can be solved in [[strongly polynomial time]], a result that is not known to be true for more general linear programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Biomimetics''' or '''biomimicry''' is the imitation of the models, systems, and elements of nature for the purpose of solving complex [[human]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vincent|first1=Julian F.

A closely related field is '''[[bionics]]'''.&lt;ref name=McCarty/&gt;

Living organisms have [[evolution|evolved]] [[adaptation (biology)|well-adapted]] structures and materials over geological time through [[natural selection]]. Biomimetics has given rise to new technologies inspired by [[biological]] solutions at macro and nanoscales. Humans have looked at nature for answers to problems throughout our existence. Nature has solved engineering problems such as self-healing abilities, environmental exposure tolerance and resistance, [[hydrophobicity]], self-assembly, and harnessing solar energy.

== History ==

One of the early examples of would-be biomimicry was the study of [[birds]] to enable [[human flight]]. Although never successful in creating a "flying machine", [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) was a keen observer of the anatomy and flight of birds, and made numerous notes and sketches on his observations as well as sketches of "flying machines".&lt;ref name="Romei 2008 56"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Romei | first=Francesca | title=Leonardo Da Vinci | publisher=The Oliver Press  | year=2008 | location=| page=56 | isbn=978-1-934545-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wright Brothers]], who succeeded in flying the first heavier-than-air aircraft in 1903, allegedly derived inspiration from observations of pigeons in flight.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite book | last=Howard | first=Fred | title=Wilbur and Orville: A Biography of the Wright Brothers | publisher=Dober Publications | year=1998 | location=| page=33 | isbn=978-0-486-40297-0 | quote = According to Wilbur, he and his brother discovered the birds' method of lateral control one day while observing a flight of pigeons. [...] 'Although we intently watched birds fly in a hope of learning something from them,' [Orville] wrote in 1941, 'I cannot think of anything that was first learned in that way.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Leonardo Design for a Flying Machine, c. 1488.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci#Flight|design for a flying machine]] with wings based closely upon the structure of bat wings.]]During the 1950s the American [[biophysicist]] and [[polymath]] [[Otto Schmitt]] developed the concept of "biomimetics".&lt;ref name="Vincent2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vincent |first= Julian F.V. |author2= Bogatyreva, Olga A. |author3= Bogatyrev, Nikolaj R. |author4= Bowyer, Adrian |author5= Pahl, Anja-Karina |title= Biomimetics: its practice and theory |journal= Journal of the Royal Society Interface |date= 21 August 2006|volume= 3|issue= 9|pages= 471–482|doi= 10.1098/rsif.2006.0127 |pmid= 16849244 |pmc= 1664643}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his doctoral research he developed the [[Schmitt trigger]] by studying the nerves in squid, attempting to engineer a device that replicated the biological system of [[nerve impulse|nerve propagation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Otto H.

{{quote|Biophysics is not so much a subject matter as it is a point of view. It is an approach to problems of biological science utilizing the theory and technology of the physical sciences. Conversely, biophysics is also a biologist's approach to problems of physical science and engineering, although this aspect has largely been neglected.|Otto Herbert Schmitt|In Appreciation, A Lifetime of Connections: Otto Herbert Schmitt, 1913 - 1998}}

In 1960 [[Jack E. Steele]] coined a similar term, ''[[bionics]]'', at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, where Otto Schmitt also worked. Steele defined bionics as "the science of systems which have some function copied from nature, or which represent characteristics of natural systems or their analogues".&lt;ref name="McCarty"&gt;Mary McCarty. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110604025951/http://www.daytondailynews.com/o/content/oh/story/opinions/columns/2009/01/29/ddn012909mary.html?cxntlid=inform_sr "Life of bionics founder a fine adventure"].

{{quote|Let us consider what bionics has come to mean operationally and what it or some word like it (I prefer biomimetics) ought to mean in order to make good use of the technical skills of scientists specializing, or rather, I should say, despecializing into this area of research|Otto Herbert Schmitt|In Appreciation, A Lifetime of Connections: Otto Herbert Schmitt, 1913 - 1998}}

In 1969 Schmitt used the term “biomimetic“ in the title one of his papers,&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt O. Third Int. Biophysics Congress. 1969. Some interesting and useful biomimetic transforms. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1974 it had found its way into [[Webster's Dictionary]], bionics entered the same dictionary earlier in 1960 as "a science concerned with the application of data about the functioning of biological systems to the solution of engineering problems". Bionic took on a different connotation when [[Martin Caidin]] referenced Jack Steele and his work in the novel ''Cyborg'' which later resulted in the 1974 television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and its spin-offs. The term bionic then became associated with "the use of electronically operated artificial body parts" and "having ordinary human powers increased by or as if by the aid of such devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Compact Oxford English Dictionary |year=2008 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-19-953296-4|last1=Soanes |first1=Catherine |last2=Hawker |first2=Sara }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the term ''bionic'' took on the implication of supernatural strength, the scientific community in [[english language|English]] speaking countries largely abandoned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last =Vincent | first =JFV | title =Biomimetics — a review | journal =Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.| volume =223 | issue=| pages=919–939 | year=2009 | url=| issn=| doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''biomimicry'' appeared as early as 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Merrill | first=Connie Lange | title=Biomimicry of the Dioxygen Active Site in the Copper Proteins Hemocyanin and Cytochrome Oxidase  | location=Rice University  | year=1982  | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomimicry was popularized by scientist and author [[Janine Benyus]] in her 1997 book ''Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature''. Biomimicry is defined in the book as a "new science that studies nature's models and then imitates or takes inspiration from these designs and processes to solve human problems". Benyus suggests looking to Nature as a "Model, Measure, and Mentor" and emphasizes sustainability as an objective of biomimicry.&lt;ref name="Benyus 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Benyus |first=Janine |title=Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature |year=1997 |publisher=[[William Morrow &amp; Company]] |location=New York, USA |isbn=978-0-688-16099-9 |ref=Benyus97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bio-inspired technologies ==
Biomimetics could in principle be applied in many fields. Because of the diversity and complexity of biological systems, the number of features that might be imitated is large. Biomimetic applications are at various stages of development from technologies that might become commercially usable to prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhushan|first1=Bharat|date=15 March 2009|title=Biomimetics: lessons from nature-an overview|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1893/1445.full|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=367|issue=1893|pages=1445–1486|doi=10.1098/rsta.2009.0011|pmid=19324719}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray's law]], which in conventional form determined the optimum diameter of blood vessels, has been re-derived to provide simple equations for the pipe or tube diameter which gives a minimum mass engineering system.&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Hugo R.|author2=Trask, Richard S.|author3=Weaver, Paul M.|author4=Bond, Ian P.|year=2008|title=Minimum mass vascular networks in multifunctional materials|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/18/55.full|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=5|issue=18|pages=55–65|doi=10.1098/rsif.2007.1022|pmc=2605499|pmid=17426011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction and architecture ===
Researchers studied the [[termite]]'s ability to maintain virtually constant temperature and humidity in their [[termite mound]]s in Africa despite outside temperatures that vary from 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 40&amp;nbsp;°C (35&amp;nbsp;°F to 104&amp;nbsp;°F).  Researchers initially scanned a termite mound and created 3-D images of the mound structure, which revealed construction that could influence human [[building design]].

Analysis of the elastic deformation happening when a pollinisator lands on the sheath-like perch part of the flower [[Strelitzia reginae|''Strelitzia reginae'']] (known as [[Strelitzia|Bird-of-Paradise]] flower) has inspired architects and scientists from the [[University of Freiburg]] and [[University of Stuttgart]] for the creation of hingeless shading systems that can react to their environment.

=== Structural materials ===
There is a great need for new structural materials that are light weight but offer exceptional combinations of [[stiffness]], strength and [[toughness]].  

Such materials would need to be manufactured into bulk materials with complex shapes at high volume and low cost and would serve a variety of fields such as construction, transportation, energy storage and conversion. In a classic design problem, strength and toughness are more likely to be mutually exclusive i.e., strong materials are brittle and tough materials are weak. However, natural materials with complex and hierarchical material gradients that span from [[Nanoscopic scale|nano]]- to macro-scales are both strong and tough. Generally, most natural materials utilize limited chemical components but complex material architectures that give rise to exceptional mechanical properties. Understanding the highly diverse and multi functional biological materials and discovering approaches to replicate such structures will lead to advanced and more efficient technologies. [[Bone]], [[nacre]] (abalone shell), teeth, the dactyl clubs of stomatopod shrimps and bamboo are great examples of damage tolerant materials.&lt;ref name="materials"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wegst|first=Ulrike G.

However, numerous processing techniques have been proposed for producing nacre like materials.&lt;ref name="materials" /&gt;

=== Adhesion ===

==== Wet adhesion ====
Some amphibians, such as tree and [[Torrent frog|torrent frogs]] and arboreal [[Salamander|salamanders]], are able to attach to and move over wet or even flooded environments without falling. This kind of organisms have toe pads which are permanently wetted by mucus secreted from glands that open into the channels between epidermal cells. They attach to mating surfaces by wet adhesion and they are capable of climbing on wet rocks even when water is flowing over the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhushan|first=Bharat|date=2009-04-28|title=Biomimetics: lessons from nature–an overview|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1893/1445|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|language=en|volume=367|issue=1893|pages=1445–1486|doi=10.1098/rsta.2009.0011|issn=1364-503X|pmid=19324719}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tire]] treads have also been inspired by the toe pads of [[Tree frog|tree frogs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/19/37/376110 Tire treads inspired by tree frogs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine [[Mussel|mussels]] can stick easily and efficiently to surfaces underwater under the harsh conditions of the ocean. Mussels use strong filaments to adhere to rocks in the inter-tidal zones of wave-swept beaches, preventing them from being swept away in strong sea currents. Mussel foot proteins attach the filaments to rocks, boats and practically any surface in nature including other mussels. These proteins contain a mix of [[amino acid]] residues which has been adapted specifically for [[adhesive]] purposes. Researchers from the University of California Santa Barbara borrowed and simplified chemistries that the mussel foot uses to overcome this engineering challenge of wet adhesion to create copolyampholytes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seo|first=Sungbaek|last2=Das|first2=Saurabh|last3=Zalicki|first3=Piotr J.|last4=Mirshafian|first4=Razieh|last5=Eisenbach|first5=Claus D.|last6=Israelachvili|first6=Jacob N.|last7=Waite|first7=J.

==== Dry adhesion ====
Leg attachment pads of several animals, including many insects (e.g. [[Beetle|beetles]] and [[Fly|flies]]), [[Spider|spiders]] and [[Lizard|lizards]] (e.g. [[Gecko|geckos]]), are capable of attaching to a variety of surfaces and are used for locomotion, even on vertical walls or across ceilings. Attachment systems in these organisms have similar structures at their terminal elements of contact, known as [[Seta|setae]]. Such biological examples have offered inspiration in order to produce climbing robots,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientisttech.com/channel/tech/mg19025526.500.html Gecko-like robot scampers up the wall – tech – 23 May 2006 – New Scientist Tech]&lt;/ref&gt; boots and tape&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/mota/education/Physics%2087N%20Final%20Projects/Group%20Gamma/gecko.htm|title=Gecko Tape|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; . [[Synthetic setae]] have also been developed for the production of dry adhesives.

[[Biomimetic material]]s are gaining increasing attention in the field of [[optics]] and [[photonics]]. There are still little known [[Bio-inspired photonics|bioinspired or biomimetic products]] involving the photonic properties of plants or animals. However, understanding how nature designed such optical materials from biological resources is worth pursuing and might lead to future commercial products.

Most [[virus]]es have an outer capsule 20 to 300&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter. Virus capsules are remarkably robust and capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 60&amp;nbsp;°C; they are stable across the [[pH]] range 2-10.&lt;ref name="Tong" /&gt; Viral capsules can be used to create nano device components such as nanowires, nanotubes, and quantum dots. Tubular virus particles such as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV) can be used as templates to create nanofibers and nanotubes, since both the inner and outer layers of the virus are charged surfaces which can induce nucleation of crystal growth. 

This was demonstrated through the production of [[platinum]] and [[gold]] nanotubes using TMV as a template.&lt;ref name="Dujardin"&gt;Dujardin E., Peet C. "Nano Letters" 2003. 3:413.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mineralized virus particles have been shown to withstand various pH values by mineralizing the viruses with different materials such as silicon, [[Lead(II) sulfide|PbS]], and [[Cadmium sulfide|CdS]] and could therefore serve as a useful carriers of material.&lt;ref name="Shenton"&gt;Shenton W. Douglas, Young M. "Advanced Materials" 1999. 11:253.&lt;/ref&gt;  A spherical plant virus called [[cowpea chlorotic mottle virus]] (CCMV) has interesting expanding properties when exposed to environments of pH higher than 6.5.  Above this pH, 60 independent pores with diameters about 2&amp;nbsp;nm begin to exchange substance with the environment.  The structural transition of the viral capsid can be utilized in [[Biomineralization|Biomorphic mineralization]] for selective uptake and deposition of minerals by controlling the solution pH.  Possible applications include using the viral cage to produce uniformly shaped and sized quantum dot [[semiconductor]] nanoparticles through a series of pH washes.  This is an alternative to the [[Ferritin|apoferritin]] cage technique currently used to synthesize uniform CdSe nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;Ischiro Yamashita, Junko Hayashi, Mashahiko Hara. "Bio-template Synthesis of Uniform CdSe Nanoparticles Using Cage-shaped Protein, Apoferritin." Chemistry Letters (2004). Volume: 33, Issue: 9. 1158–1159.&lt;/ref&gt; Such materials could also be used for targeted drug delivery since particles release contents upon exposure to specific pH levels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9801">{{about|| the [[hyperpigmentation]] (skin discolouration) condition nicknamed "bronze disease" |Addison's disease}}

'''Bronze disease''' is the irreversible and nearly inexorable [[corrosion]] process occurring when [[chloride]]s come into contact with [[bronze]] or other copper-bearing alloys. It occurs as a dark [[green]] or a lighter fuzzy green coating on copper, bronze, and other copper-bearing alloys generally due either to contamination by salt water or after burial in dirt (as chloride salts are generally present in soil to some degree). If not treated, complete destruction of the affected artifact is possible. Transfer of chlorides from the contaminated artifact to other artifacts can spread the condition.

== Description ==
Bronze disease is the chloride corrosion of cupreous (copper based) artifacts. It was originally thought to be caused by bacteria. It is contagious in that the chlorides which cause it can spread the condition if they are brought into contact with another cupreous object. Despite its name bronze disease can affect any copper-bearing alloy, not just bronze. It is not reserved for antique objects but can affect contemporary metals like modern [[cupro-nickel]] coins.

Bronze disease ranges from vivid green to pastel green. It is commonly present in all colors in this range due to the series of reactions that cause it and there may also be tiny, possibly microscopic, blue crystals. Bronze disease typically affects isolated patches of the object in severe cases being a visibly and tactilely raised bloom of microscopic crystals as well as being associated with pitting. The patches of bronze disease can be scraped off the surface using a fingernail or a wooden pick. These properties are all in comparison with [[verdigris]], which is normally a duller shade, uniform across the whole of the affected object, and cannot be scratched off with wood or fingernails. Unlike bronze disease, verdigris serves to protect the metal.

As it relies upon the presence of chlorides, water, and oxygen, the absence of one of these three halts the progress, although any damage done is irreversible. Treatment for the condition typically involves physical removal of the chlorides (through scrubbing), chemical or electrochemical removal, and then isolating the object from oxygen, water, and future chloride contamination using an airtight container or a wax coating. These treatments may also remove any patina, loss of which is often seen as undesirable to collectors and conservators but is preferable to loss of the object.

Bronze disease is common or even ubiquitous on artifacts recovered from a marine environment due to the presence of chlorides in sea water. Coastal areas may also be hazardous due to salt carried in the atmosphere as well as the humidity. Absence of dissolved chlorides and oxygen in soil means buried objects may not be affected while interred (similarly, lack of soluble salts and oxygen means that buried metals may not develop a [[patina]] or that oxidation of the metal may be reversed). When an artifact is recovered, surface encrustations may hide and/or protect bronze disease.

Chlorides may occur in or on the metal due to contamination from soil, water (especially sea water), the atmosphere, human sweat, or be present as impurities when the object was created. In many cases chlorides may be present within the interior of the artifact; the disease may reoccur if not isolated from water and/or oxygen.

== Reaction ==
Initially copper is oxidized to the cuprous ion:

(1) Cu → Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The cuprous ion reacts with the chloride ion to form the insoluble white colored salt [[cuprous chloride]]:

(2) Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → CuCl

The cuprous chloride reacts with atmospheric moisture and oxygen to form a green [[cupric chloride]]/cupric hydroxide compound and [[hydrochloric acid]]:

(3) 4 CuCl + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·3 Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl

The remaining copper is oxidised by air to the cuprous ion:

(4) Cu → Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The cuprous ion reacts with the chloride ion in the hydrochloric acid to form the insoluble white colored salt [[cuprous chloride]]:

(5) Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → CuCl

The reaction then repeats from equation (3). It is the presence of two different white and green salts that lead to the fuzzy green appearance.

== Treatment and prevention ==
Initial treatment can involve placing the object in a desiccating environment. Deprived of water, the reaction cannot continue. However, re-exposure of the object to even atmospheric water can restart the process.

=== Surface treatment ===
[[File:Carbonate crystals forming on ancient bronze coin.ogg|thumb|Formation of harmless unidentified sodium carbonate crystals on ancient Roman bronze coin that has been treated in carbonate solution for bronze disease for four weeks and has been removed and rinsed several times. Video has been accelerated to ten times normal speed.]]

Removal of the chlorides is essential. In practice this first involves physical cleaning (with a wooden or even metal pick) to remove the bulk of the chlorides and then chemical treatment. One chemical treatment is soaking the object in a 5% [[sodium sesquicarbonate]] solution. This serves to neutralize the acid that attacks the metal as well as converting the reactive cuprous chloride to largely inert cuprous oxide. The oxide may coat the artifact with unsightly but harmless black spots or generally darken the metal.

The duration of soaking may be days to weeks or even a year for severely contaminated objects. The sesquicarbonate may remove copper from the artifact as it forms a [[complex ion]] with copper. Amateurs report that the patina may be stripped from the artifact but this is when the solution is boiled so that the carbonate rinse removes the chlorides in hours rather than the cool bath of long duration used by professional conservators.

Soaking in [[sodium carbonate]]—which does not form a complex ion with copper and is unlikely to affect the patina but is slower than the sesquicarbonate—or [[benzotriazole]] aqueous solutions may also be used. The carbonate is similar in effect to the sesquicarbonate. The benzotriazole does not remove the chlorides or neutralize the acid present but acts as a physical barrier to water, oxygen, and chlorides and so can be used as a final step in all cases but as a first or only step in only minor cases.

Use of tap water for initial carbonate rinses is fine as any chloride content in the water is low compared to the content found when the chlorides from the contaminated artifact have dissolved into the water. Later rinses should be with distilled water though it is to be noted that the chlorine of a chlorinated town water supply is likely to have evaporated from tap water inside 24 hours and therefore will not further contaminate the object.

[[File:Carbonate crystals formed on ancient bronze coin.png|thumb|Unidentified sodium carbonate crystals (white) formed on the same Roman coin treated for bronze disease. The green masses on the coin's reverse are a copper carbonate which formed in the region where the bronze disease was most prevalent. It will be physically removed to ensure that the chlorides have also been removed prior to further conservation efforts. The photos were taken some 20 minutes after rinsing and surface drying.]]

Instead of rinses, electrolysis may be used, often with sodium carbonate as the electrolyte and mild or stainless steel as the anode. This converts the cupreous ions to elemental copper. Elemental copper released from the chlorides may be redeposited on the artifact as a pinkish coating. A coin may take only hours, whereas a large artifact, such as a cannon, may take months.

Once treated, the specimen should be held in a dry environment and periodically inspected for recurrence of bronze disease as no long-term treatment has been confirmed.

=== Internal treatment ===
If chloride ions have penetrated beyond the surface more rigorous treatment is required.

This typically involves soaking in acetone to displace any water in the specimen. Then soaking in a [[benzotriazole]] (BTA)–[[ethanol]] solution to [[chelate]] the copper and make it unreactive. Pits and holes may be filled with zinc powder, which is then painted over with [[shellac]] coloured to look like the specimen.

=== Prevention ===
Waxes prepared with BTA are available commercially, the idea being that the BTA will prevent any reaction by chelating the surface copper and the wax acting as a physical barrier reducing exposure to water, oxygen, and chlorides. (However, coating an infected object with wax will not obviate the problem.) Storing the object in a completely dry or oxygen free environment will also prevent bronze disease as will isolation from contact with chlorides.

The '''center of gravity (CG) of an aircraft''' is the point over which the aircraft would balance.&lt;ref name="faa-1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/faa-h-8083-1.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|title=Aircraft Weight and Balance Handbook|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its position is calculated after supporting the aircraft on at least two sets of [[weighing scale]]s or [[load cell]]s and noting the weight shown on each set of scales or load cells.  The center of gravity affects the [[Longitudinal static stability|stability]] of the aircraft. To ensure the aircraft is safe to fly, the [[Center of mass|center of gravity]] must fall within specified limits established by the aircraft manufacturer.

== Terminology ==
[[File:KLM vliegtuig op Schiphol, Bestanddeelnr 189-0841.jpg|thumb|The nose baggage compartment of a [[:en:Fokker F.XII|Fokker F.XII]] in 1933, avoiding the problem of heavy weights towards the rear]]
;Ballast: Ballast is removable or permanently installed weight in an aircraft used to bring the center of gravity into the allowable range.

;Center-of-Gravity Limits: Center of gravity (CG) limits are specified longitudinal (forward and aft) and/or lateral (left and right) limits within which the aircraft's center of gravity must be located during flight. The CG limits are indicated in the airplane flight manual. The area between the limits is called the ''CG range'' of the aircraft.

;Weight and Balance:When the weight of the aircraft is at or below the allowable limit(s) for its configuration (parked, ground movement, take-off, landing, etc.) and its center of gravity is within the allowable range, and both will remain so for the duration of the flight, the aircraft is said to be within ''weight and balance''.  Different maximum weights may be defined for different situations; for example, large aircraft may have maximum landing weights that are lower than maximum take-off weights (because some weight is expected to be lost as fuel is burned during the flight).  The center of gravity may change over the duration of the flight as the aircraft's weight changes due to fuel burn or by passengers moving forward or aft in the cabin.

;Reference Datum:The ''reference datum'' is a reference plane that allows accurate, and uniform, measurements to any point on the aircraft. The location of the reference datum is established by the manufacturer and is defined in the aircraft flight manual. The horizontal reference datum is an imaginary vertical plane or point, placed along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, from which all horizontal distances are measured for weight and balance purposes. There is no fixed rule for its location, and it may be located forward of the nose of the aircraft. For helicopters, it may be located at the rotor mast, the nose of the helicopter, or even at a point in space ahead of the helicopter. While the horizontal reference datum can be anywhere the manufacturer chooses, most small training helicopters have the horizontal reference datum 100&amp;nbsp;inches forward of the main rotor shaft centerline. This is to keep all the computed values positive. The lateral reference datum is usually located at the center of the helicopter.&lt;ref name="faa-2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/helicopter_flying_handbook/media/helicopter_flying_handbook.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|title=Rotorcraft Flying Handbook|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Arm:The arm is the horizontal distance from the reference datum to the center of gravity (CG) of an item. The algebraic sign is plus (+) if measured aft of the datum or to the right side of the center line when considering a lateral calculation. The algebraic sign is minus (-) if measured forward of the datum or the left side of the center line when considering a lateral calculation.&lt;ref name="faa-1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/faa-h-8083-1.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|title=Aircraft Weight and Balance Handbook|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Moment:The moment is the moment of force, or [[torque]], that results from an object’s weight acting through an arc that is centered on the zero point of the reference datum distance. Moment is also referred to as the tendency of an object to rotate or pivot about a point (the zero point of the datum, in this case). The further an object is from this point, the greater the force it exerts. Moment is calculated by multiplying the weight of an object by its arm.

;[[Chord (aeronautics)|Mean Aerodynamic Chord]] (MAC): A specific chord line of a tapered wing.  At the mean aerodynamic chord, the center of pressure has the same aerodynamic force, position, and area as it does on the rest of the wing.  The MAC represents the width of an equivalent rectangular wing in given conditions.  On some aircraft, the center of gravity is expressed as a percentage of the length of the MAC.  In order to make such a calculation, the position of the leading edge of the MAC must be known ahead of time.  This position is defined as a distance from the reference datum and is found in the [[Aircraft flight manual|aircraft's flight manual]] and also on the aircraft's type certificate data sheet. If a general MAC is not given but a LeMAC (leading edge mean aerodynamic chord) and a TeMAC (trailing edge mean aerodynamic chord) are given (both of which would be referenced as an arm measured out from the datum line) then your MAC can be found by finding the difference between your LeMAC and your TeMAC.

== Calculation ==

Center of gravity (CG) is calculated as follows:

*Determine the weights and arms of all mass within the aircraft.
*Multiply weights by arms for all mass to calculate moments.
*Add the moments of all mass together.
*Divide the total moment by the total mass of the aircraft to give an overall arm.

The arm that results from this calculation must be within the center of gravity limits dictated by the aircraft manufacturer.  If it is not, weight in the aircraft must be removed, added (rarely), or redistributed until the center of gravity falls within the prescribed limits.

Aircraft center of gravity calculations are only performed along a single axis from the zero point of the reference datum that represents the longitudinal axis of the aircraft (to calculate fore-to-aft balance). Some helicopter types utilize lateral CG limits as well as longitudinal limits. Operation of such helicopters requires calculating CG along two axes: one calculation for longitudinal CG (fore-to-aft balance) and another calculation for lateral CG (left-to-right balance).

The weight, moment and arm values of fixed items on the aircraft (i.e. engines, wings, electronic components) do not change and are provided by the manufacturer on the Aircraft Equipment List. The manufacturer also provides information facilitating the calculation of moments for fuel loads. Removable weight items (i.e. crew members, passengers, baggage) must be properly accounted for in the weight and CG calculation by the aircraft operator.

===Example=== 
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!
! Mass (lb)
! Arm (in)
! Moment (lb-in)
|-
| Empty aircraft
| 1,495.0
| 101.4
| 151,593.0
|-
| Pilot and passengers
| 380.0
| 64.0
| 24,320.0
|-
| Fuel (30 gallons @ 6&amp;nbsp;lb/gal)
| 180.0
| 96.0
| 17,280.0
|-
| Totals
| 2,055.0
| 94.0
|193,193.0
|}

To find the center of gravity, we divide the total moment by the total mass: 193,193 / 2,055 = 94.01 inches behind the datum plane.

In larger aircraft, weight and balance is often expressed as a percentage of mean aerodynamic chord, or MAC.  For example, assume the leading edge of the MAC is 62 inches aft of the datum.  Therefore, the CG calculated above lies 32 inches aft of the leading edge of the MAC.  If the MAC is 80 inches in length, the percentage of MAC is 32 / 80 = 40%. If the allowable limits were 15% to 35%, the aircraft would ''not'' be properly loaded.

== Incorrect weight and balance in fixed-wing aircraft ==
[[Image:BAe 146 centre of gravity problem.JPG|thumb|The center of gravity of this [[British Aerospace 146]] shifted rearward after its engines were removed, making it unstable. As a result, it tipped back onto its rear fuselage in windy conditions.]]
When the center of gravity or weight of an aircraft is outside the acceptable range, the aircraft may not be able to sustain flight, or it may be impossible to maintain the aircraft in level flight in some or all circumstances, in some events resulting in [[load shifting]].  Placing the CG or weight of an aircraft outside the allowed range can lead to an unavoidable crash of the aircraft.

=== Center of gravity out of range ===
When the fore-aft center of gravity (CG) is out of range serious aircraft control problems occur.  The fore-aft CG affects longitudinal stability of the aircraft, with the stability increasing as the CG moves forward, and stability decreasing as the CG moves aft.  With a forward CG position, although the stability of the aircraft increases, the elevator control authority is reduced in the capability of raising the nose of the aircraft.  This can cause a serious condition during the landing flare when the nose cannot be raised sufficiently to slow the aircraft.  An aft CG position creates severe handling problems due to the reduced pitch stability and increased elevator control sensitivity, with potential loss of aircraft control.  Because the burning of fuel gradually produces a loss of weight and possibly a shift in the CG, it is possible for an aircraft to take off with the CG within normal operating range, and yet later develop an imbalance that results in control problems.  Calculations of CG must take this into account (often part of this is calculated in advance by the manufacturer and incorporated into CG limits).

Here's an example of a Piper Mirage with too much weight in the back of the aircraft that results in the Takeoff CG within limits (the green reference point) but the Landing CG is aft of the CG Envelope limits (the blue reference point).&lt;ref&gt;http://eflite.com/images/creative_commons/Aircraft_with_Aft_CG_Limit_Issue.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adjusting CG within limits ===
The amount a weight must be moved can be found by using the following formula
 shift dist = (total weight * cg change) / weight shifted

Example:
 1500lbs * 33.9in = 50,850 moment (airplane)
 100lbs * 84in = 6800 moment (baggage)
 cg = 37in = (50,850+6800) / 1600lbs (1/2in out of cg limit)

We want to move the CG 1in using a 100lb bag in the baggage compartment.

 shift dist = (total weight * cg change) / weight shifted
 16in = (1600lb * 1in) / 100lb

Reworking the problem with 100lbs moved 16in forward to 68in moves CG 1-in.
 new cg = 36in

=== Weight out of range ===

Few aircraft impose a minimum weight for flight (although a minimum pilot weight is often specified), but all impose a maximum weight.  If the maximum weight is exceeded, the aircraft may not be able to achieve or sustain controlled, level flight.  Excessive take-off weight may make it impossible to take off within available runway lengths, or it may completely prevent take-off.  Excessive weight in flight may make climbing beyond a certain altitude difficult or impossible, or it may make it impossible to maintain an altitude.

== Incorrect weight and balance in helicopters ==

The center of gravity is even more critical for helicopters than it is for fixed-wing aircraft (weight issues remain the same). As with fixed-wing aircraft, a helicopter may be properly loaded for takeoff, but near the end of a long flight when the fuel tanks are almost empty, the CG may have shifted enough for the helicopter to be out of balance laterally or longitudinally.&lt;ref name="faa-1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/faa-h-8083-1.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|title=Aircraft Weight and Balance Handbook|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For helicopters with a single main rotor, the CG is usually close to the main rotor mast. Improper balance of a helicopter’s load can result in serious control problems. In addition to making a helicopter difficult to control, an out-of-balance loading condition also decreases maneuverability since cyclic control is less effective in the direction opposite to the CG location.

The pilot tries to perfectly balance a helicopter so that the fuselage remains horizontal in hovering flight, with no cyclic pitch control needed except for wind correction. Since the fuselage acts as a pendulum suspended from the rotor, changing the center of gravity changes the angle at which the aircraft hangs from the rotor. When the center of gravity is directly under the rotor mast, the helicopter hangs horizontal; if the CG is too far forward of the mast, the helicopter hangs
with its nose tilted down; if the CG is too far aft of the mast, the nose tilts up.

=== CG forward of forward limit ===

A forward CG may occur when a heavy pilot and passenger take off without baggage or proper ballast located aft of the rotor mast. This situation becomes worse if the fuel tanks are located aft of the rotor mast because as fuel burns the weight located aft of the rotor mast becomes less.

This condition is recognizable when coming to a hover following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter will have a nose-low attitude, and the pilot will need excessive rearward displacement of the cyclic control to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition. In this condition, the pilot could rapidly run out of rearward cyclic control as the helicopter consumes fuel. The pilot may also find it impossible to decelerate sufficiently to bring the helicopter to a stop. In the event of engine failure and the resulting [[autorotation]], the pilot may not have enough cyclic control to flare properly for the landing.

A forward CG will not be as obvious when hovering into a strong wind, since less rearward cyclic displacement is required than when hovering with no wind. When determining whether a critical balance condition exists, it is essential to consider the wind velocity and its relation to the rearward displacement of the cyclic control.

=== CG aft of aft limit ===

Without proper ballast in the cockpit, exceeding the aft CG may occur when:

* A lightweight pilot takes off solo with a full load of fuel located aft of the rotor mast.
* A lightweight pilot takes off with maximum baggage allowed in a baggage compartment located aft of the rotor mast.
* A lightweight pilot takes off with a combination of baggage and substantial fuel where both are aft of the rotor mast.

An aft CG condition can be recognized by the pilot when coming to a hover following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter will have a tail-low attitude, and the pilot will need excessive forward displacement of cyclic control to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition. If there is a wind, the pilot needs even greater forward cyclic. If flight is continued in this condition, the pilot may find it impossible to fly in the upper allowable airspeed range due to inadequate forward cyclic authority to maintain a nose-low attitude. In addition, with an extreme aft CG, gusty or rough air could accelerate the helicopter to a speed faster than that produced with full forward cyclic control. In this case, [[dissymmetry of lift]] and blade flapping could cause the rotor disc to tilt aft. With full forward cyclic control already applied, the rotor disc might not be able to be lowered, resulting in possible loss of control, or the rotor blades striking the tail boom.

== Lateral balance ==

In fixed-wing aircraft, lateral balance is often much less critical than fore-aft balance, simply because most mass in the aircraft is located very close to its center.  An exception is fuel, which may be loaded into the wings, but since fuel loads are usually symmetrical about the axis of the aircraft, lateral balance is not usually affected.  The lateral center of gravity may become important if the fuel is not loaded evenly into tanks on both sides of the aircraft, or (in the case of small aircraft) when passengers are predominantly on one side of the aircraft (such as a pilot flying alone in a small aircraft).  Small lateral deviations of CG that are within limits may cause an annoying roll tendency that pilots must compensate for, but they are not dangerous as long as the CG remains within limits for the duration of the flight.

For most helicopters, it is usually not necessary to determine the lateral CG for normal flight instruction and passenger flights. This is because helicopter cabins are relatively narrow and most optional equipment is located near the center line. However, some helicopter manuals specify the seat from which solo flight must be conducted. In addition, if there is an unusual situation, such as a heavy pilot and a full load of fuel on one side of the helicopter, which could affect the lateral CG, its position should be checked against the CG envelope. If carrying external loads in a position that requires large lateral cyclic control displacement to maintain level flight, fore and aft cyclic effectiveness could be dramatically limited.

== Fuel dumping and overweight operations ==

Many large transport-category aircraft are able to take-off at a greater weight than they can land.  This is possible because the weight of fuel that the wings can support along their span in flight, or when parked or taxiing on the ground, is greater than they can tolerate during the stress of landing and touchdown, when the support is not distributed along the span of the wing.

Normally the portion of the aircraft's weight that exceeds the maximum landing weight (but falls within the maximum take-off weight) is entirely composed of fuel.  As the aircraft flies, the fuel burns off, and by the time the aircraft is ready to land, it is below its maximum landing weight.  However, if an aircraft must land early, sometimes the fuel that remains aboard still keeps the aircraft over the maximum landing weight.  When this happens, the aircraft must either burn off the fuel (by flying in a holding pattern) or dump it (if the aircraft is equipped to do this) before landing to avoid damage to the aircraft.  In an emergency, an aircraft may choose to land overweight, but this may damage it, and at the very least an overweight landing will mandate a thorough inspection to check for any damage.

In some cases, an aircraft may take off overweight deliberately.  An example might be an aircraft being ferried over a very long distance with extra fuel aboard.  An overweight take-off typically requires an exceptionally long runway.  Overweight operations are not permitted with passengers aboard.

Many smaller aircraft have a maximum landing weight that is the same as the maximum take-off weight, in which case issues of overweight landing due to excess fuel being on board cannot arise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2968">[[Image:Qinnotation.png|thumb|Chinese [[Guqin notation]], 1425]]

Systems of [[musical notation]] have been in use in [[China]] for over two thousand years. Different systems have been used to record music for bells and for the ''[[guqin]]'' stringed instrument. More recently a system of numbered notes (''[[Numbered musical notation|jianpu]]'') has been used, with resemblances to Western notations.

== Ancient ==
The earliest known examples of text referring to music in China are inscriptions on musical instruments found in the Tomb of [[Marquess|Marquis]] Yi of Zeng (d. 433 B.C.). Sets of 41 chimestones and 65 bells bore lengthy inscriptions concerning pitches, scales, and transposition. The bells still sound the pitches that their inscriptions refer to. Although no notated musical compositions were found, the inscriptions indicate that the system was sufficiently advanced to allow for musical notation. Two systems of pitch nomenclature existed, one for relative pitch and one for absolute pitch. For relative pitch, a [[solmization]] system was used.&lt;ref&gt;Bagley, Robert (2004). "[http://www.britac.ac.uk/events/2004/abstracts/2004-bagley.htm The Prehistory of Chinese Music Theory]" (''Elsley Zeitlyn Lecture on Chinese Archaeology and Culture''), ''Britac.ac.uk''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Guqin'' notations==
The tablature of the ''[[guqin]]'' is unique and complex. The older form is composed of written words describing how to play a melody step-by-step using the plain language of the time, i.e. ''descriptive notation'' ([[Classical Chinese]]).  

The newer form of ''guqin'' notation is composed of bits of Chinese characters put together to indicate the method of play is called ''prescriptive notation''. Rhythm is only vaguely indicated in terms of phrasing. Tablatures for the ''qin'' are collected in what is called ''[[qinpu]]''.

== ''Gongche'' notation ==
''[[Gongche notation]]'', dating from the [[Tang dynasty]], used Chinese characters for the names of the scale.

== ''Jianpu'' (numbered musical notation) ==
The ''[[Numbered musical notation|jianpu]]'' system of notation (probably an adaptation of a French Galin-Paris-Cheve system) had gained widespread acceptance by 1900. It uses a movable ''do'' system, with the scale degrees 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 standing for ''do'', ''re'', ''mi'', ''fa'', ''sol'', ''la'', ''si''. Dots above or below a numeral indicate the octave of the note it represents. Key signatures, barlines, and time signatures are also employed. Many symbols from Western standard notation, such as bar lines, time signatures, accidentals, tie and slur, and the expression markings are also used. The number of dashes following a numeral represents the number of crotchets (quarter notes) by which the note extends.

'''Circle grid analysis''' ('''CGA'''), also known as '''circle grid strain analysis''', is a method of measuring the [[strain (mechanics)|strain]] levels of [[sheet metal]] after a part is formed by [[stamping (metalworking)|stamping]] or [[Drawing (manufacturing)|drawing]]. The name itself is a fairly accurate description of the process. Literally, a grid of circles of known diameter is [[industrial etching|etched]] to the surface of the sheet metal to be formed. After the part is formed, the circles have been stretched into ellipses. By measuring the longest part of the ellipse (called the “major strain”) and the shortest part of the ellipse (called the “minor strain”), it is possible to determine how close any stamped part is to splitting or fracturing. 

The goal of using circle grid strain analysis is to predict potential problems before they become problems. Once you have a forming problem, chances are circle grid analysis won’t be able to help you, unless it’s intermittent enough to form a “good” part from time to time.

It can also be referred to as a ''drive pipe'' because it is often ''driven'' into the ground with a [[pile driver]].

'''Conductor pipe''' is typically set, on petroleum wells, before any drilling operations are performed. It is usually set with special pile-driving or spudder rigs, though the [[drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rig]] is sometimes used to save time and money.

In the [[offshore drilling]] industry, the conductor pipe is set in the seabed, and is a key structural foundation for the subsea [[wellhead]]. When drilling an offshore well, a [[marine riser]] is connected to the well, and this is subjected to large environmental forces such as current and waves which are transferred to the conductor. The forces can be large and also cyclical which can potentially cause fatigue damage to the conductor, especially in harsh environmental conditions. A Conductor tensioner unit (CTU) can be used in shallow water on [[jackup rig]] to withstand such damaging forces.

'''Crazing''' is the phenomenon that produces a network of fine cracks on the surface of a material, for example in a [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] layer. Crazing frequently precedes fracture in some [[glass]]y [[thermoplastic]] [[polymer]]s. As it only takes place under tensile stress, the plane of the crazing corresponds to the stress direction. The effect is visibly distinguishable from other types of fine cracking because the crazing region has different [[refractive index|refractive indices]] from surrounding material. Crazing occurs in regions of high [[hydrostatic]] tension, or in regions of very localized [[Yield (engineering)|yielding]], which leads to the formation of interpenetrating microvoids and small [[fibril]]s. If an applied tensile load is sufficient, these bridges elongate and break, causing the microvoids to grow and coalesce; as microvoids coalesce, [[Fracture in polymers|cracks]] begin to form.

Crazing occurs in polymers, because the material is held together by a combination of weaker [[Van der Waals force]]s and stronger [[covalent bond]]s.  Sufficient local stress overcomes the Van der Waals force, allowing a narrow gap.  Once the slack is taken out of backbone chain, covalent bonds holding the chain together hinder further widening of the gap.  The gaps in a craze are microscopic in size.  Crazes can be seen because light reflects off the surfaces of the gaps.  The gaps are bridged by fine [[wikt:filament|filament]] called fibrils, which are molecules of the stretched backbone chain.  The fibrils are only a few [[nanometers]] in diameter, and cannot be seen with a light microscope, but are visible with an electron microscope.&lt;ref name="ps"&gt;

The thickness profile of a crazing is like a sewing needle: the very tip of the crazing may be as thin as several atoms, as the distance from the tip increase, it tends to thicken gradually with the rate of the increase diminishing with distance. Therefore, the growth of crazing has a critical distance from the tip. The opening angle of the crazing lies between 2° to 10°. The boundary between crazing and surrounding bulk polymer is very sharp, the microstructure of which can be scaled down to 20Å or less, which means it can only be observed by electron microscopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kambour|first=R. P.|date=1973|title=A review of crazing and fracture in thermoplastics|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pol.1973.230070101|journal=Journal of Polymer Science: Macromolecular Reviews|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–154|doi=10.1002/pol.1973.230070101|issn=0076-2083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A craze is different from a [[Fracture|crack]] in that it cannot be felt on the surface and it can continue to support a load. Furthermore, the process of craze growth prior to cracking absorbs fracture energy and effectively increases the [[fracture toughness]] of a polymer. The initial energy absorption per square meter in a craze region has been found to be up to several hundred times that of the uncrazed region, but quickly decreases and levels off. Crazes form at highly [[stress (physics)|stressed]] regions associated with scratches, flaws, [[stress concentration]]s and molecular inhomogeneities. Crazes generally propagate perpendicular to the applied tension. Crazing occurs mostly in amorphous, brittle [[polymer]]s like [[polystyrene]] (PS), [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] (PMMA), and [[polycarbonate]]; it is typified by a whitening of the crazed region. The white colour is caused by light-scattering from the crazes.

Besides, the production of crazing is a reversible process, after applied compressive stress or elevated temperature (higher than glass transformation temperature), it may disappear and the materials will return to optically homogeneous state.

Shear banding is the narrow region with high level of shearing strain from local strain softening, it is also very common during the deformation of thermoplastic materials. One of the main differences between crazing and [[shear band]]ing, is that crazing occurs with an increase in volume, which shear banding does not. This means that under compression, many of these brittle, amorphous polymers will shear band rather than craze, as there is a contraction of volume instead of an increase. In addition, when crazing occurs, one will typically not observe "necking," or concentration of force upon one spot in a material. Rather, crazing will occur homogeneously throughout the material.

===Rubber toughening===
Rubber particles are often used to toughen thermoplastic materials, after modified, the ability of absorbing energy will be increased significantly. For some brittle plastic materials, they can even go through brittle-ductile transformation. Previously, the rubber particles were considered as the main contributor to the increased energy absorption. It was proposed that rubber particles might gather around crack tips under tension and impede the growth of crack, or the contraction of rubber particles induced the decline of glass transformation temperature of the matrix. Nevertheless, experiments showed that the energy absorbed by rubber particles made up only 10% of the total energy, and the decrease of glass transformation temperature caused by rubber was only around 10 K, which was not enough for the matrix to yield at room temperature.

Schmitt and Bucknall developed the mechanism of rubber toughening according to the existence of stress whitening and shear yielding when the stress is lower than fracture strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BUCKNALL|first=C. B.|last2=CLAYTON|first2=D.|date=1971-05-31|title=Dilatometric Studies of Crazing in Rubber-toughened Plastics|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/physci231107a0|journal=Nature Physical Science|volume=231|issue=22|pages=107–108|doi=10.1038/physci231107a0|issn=0300-8746}}&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed that the rubber particles served as the center for stress concentration, hence initiated the brittle-ductile transformation and yielding of the matrix material. To specify, yielding happens in the form of crazing or shear band, which can consume a large portion of deformation energy.

=== Environment effect ===
Crazing can take place in glassy polymers under environmental effects. It is troublesome because it requires a much lower stress state and sometimes it happens in a long delay, which means it's hard to detect and avoid. For example, the PMMA containers in daily use is quite resistive to humidity and temperature without any visible defects. But after they are machine-washed and then left in air for one or two days, they will shutter abruptly when wet with gin.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} During the process, the stress applied is negligible, but crazing is still found in the containers.

There are many theories that tried to explain the environmental effects upon formation of crazing, among which surface energy reduction and plasticization are widely accepted and well developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunn|first=P.|last2=Sansom|first2=G. F.|date=August 1969|title=The stress cracking of polyamides by metal salts. Part I. Metal halides|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/app.1969.070130806|journal=Journal of Applied Polymer Science|volume=13|issue=8|pages=1641–1655|doi=10.1002/app.1969.070130806|issn=0021-8995}}&lt;/ref&gt; To eliminate the environmental crazing and cracking, many methods like surface coating, stress reduction are adopted. However, due to the complicity of the environmental effects, especially the effects in organic environment, it's hard to find a general solution and remove the effect completely.

==Construction==
Crazing is also seen on single ply roofing membranes, and on [[concrete]] when good concrete practices are not followed.

==Ceramics==
Crazing is a [[glaze defect]] of [[Ceramic glaze|glazed]] [[pottery]]. Characterised as a [[spider web]] pattern of cracks penetrating the glaze, it is caused by [[tensile stress]]es greater than the glaze is able to withstand.&lt;ref&gt;”Ceramics Glaze Technology.” J.R.Taylor, A.C.Bull. ''Institute Of Ceramics / Pergamon Press.'' 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ceramic Glazes. 3rd edition. Parmelee C. W. ''The Maple Press Company.'' 1973&lt;/ref&gt;  In pottery a distinction is often made between crazing, as an accidental defect, and "[[Craquelure#Craquelure in ceramics|crackle]]", when the same phenomenon, often strongly accentuated, is produced deliberately. The Chinese in particular enjoyed the random effects of crackle and whereas in [[Ru ware]] it seems to have been a tolerated feature of most pieces, but not sought, in [[Guan ware]] a strong crackle was a desired effect.

==Odontology==
Crazing is also used as a term in [[odontology]] to describe fine cracks in the [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] of teeth.

==Metaphor==

The root sense of “crazy” in English, meaning “to shatter, crush, or break,” dates to the 1300s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=craze&amp;allowed_in_frame=0&lt;/ref&gt; The metaphorical senses familiar today derive from crazing in pottery: “crazy” meaning “diseased or sickly” dates to about 1570; “of unsound mind,” to about 1610.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=crazy&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], '''dactyly''' is the arrangement of [[wikt:digit|digits]] ([[finger]]s and [[toe]]s) on the [[hand]]s, feet, or sometimes [[wing]]s of a [[tetrapod]] [[animal]].  It comes from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] word δακτυλος (''dáktulos'') = "finger".

Sometimes the ending "-dactylia" is used. The derived adjectives end with "-dactyl" or "-dactylous".

==As a normal feature==

===Pentadactyly===
Pentadactyly (from [[Greek language|Greek]] πέντε (''pénte'') = "five" and δάκτυλος (''dáktulos'') = "finger") is the condition of having five digits on each limb. It is believed that all living [[tetrapod]]s are descended from an ancestor with a pentadactyl limb, although many species have now lost or transformed some or all of their digits by the process of [[evolution]]. However, this viewpoint was challenged by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] in his 1991 essay "Eight (Or Fewer) Little Piggies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_eight-piggies.html | title=Stephen Jay Gould "Eight (or Fewer) Little Piggies" 1991 | author=Stephen Jay Gould | accessdate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the individual variations listed below, the relationship is to the original five-digit model.

In reptiles, the limbs are pentadactylous.

===Tetradactyly===
Tetradactyly (from Greek tetra-="four" plus δακτυλος = "finger") is the condition of having four digits on a limb, as in many [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s. Some mammals also exhibit tetradactyly (for example the hind limbs of dogs and cats). Cartoon characters are commonly drawn with four digits on each hand/foot as it's clearer to see than five.

===Tridactyly===
Tridactyly (from Greek tri- = "three" plus δακτυλος = "finger") is the condition of having three digits on a limb, as in the [[rhinoceros]] and ancestors of the horse such as ''[[Protohippus]]'' and ''[[Hipparion]]''. These all belong to the [[Perissodactyla]]. Some birds also have three toes, including [[emu]]s, [[bustards]], and [[quail]].

===Didactyly===
Didactyly (from Greek di-="two" plus δακτυλος = "finger") or bidactyly is the condition of having two digits on each limb, as in the [[Hypertragulidae]] and [[two-toed sloth]], ''Choloepus didactylus''. In humans this name is used for an abnormality in which the middle digits are missing, leaving only the thumb and fifth finger, or big and little toes. Cloven-hoofed mammals (such as deer, sheep and cattle - ''[[Artiodactyla]]'') have only two digits, as do [[ostriches]].

===Monodactyly===
Monodactyly (from Greek monos- = "one" plus δακτυλος = "finger") is the condition of having a single digit on a limb, as in modern [[horse]]s. These belong to the [[Perissodactyla]].

==As a congenital defect==

===Syndactyly===
[[Image:Celldeath.jpg|thumb|Human foot with partial simple syndactyly.]]

{{Main|Syndactyly}}
[[Syndactyly]] (from Greek συν- = "together" plus δακτυλος = "finger") is a condition where two or more digits are fused together. It occurs normally in some [[mammal]]s, such as the [[siamang]] and most [[diprotodont]]id [[marsupial]]s such as [[kangaroos]]. It occurs as an unusual condition in humans.

===Polydactyly===
{{Main|Polydactyly}}
[[Polydactyly]] (from Greek πολυ- = "many" plus δακτυλος = "finger") is when a limb has more than the usual number of digits. This can be:
* As a result of congenital abnormality in a normally pentadactyl animal.  Polydactyly is very common among domestic cats. For more information, see [[polydactyly]].
* [[Polydactyly in early tetrapod]] [[aquatic animal]]s, such as in ''[[Acanthostega gunnari]]'' (Jarvik 1952), one of an increasing number of genera of stem-tetrapods known from the [[Upper Devonian]], which are providing insights into the appearance of tetrapods and the origin of limbs with digits. It also occurs secondarily in some later tetrapods, such as [[ichthyosaurs]]. The use of a term normally reserved for congenital defects reflects that it was regarded as an anomaly at the time, as it was believed that all modern tetrapods have either five digits or ancestors that did.

===Oligodactyly===
{{Main|Oligodactyly}}
[[Oligodactyly]] (from Greek ὀλιγο- = "few" plus δακτυλος = "finger") is having too few digits when not caused by an [[amputation]]. It is sometimes incorrectly called '''hypodactyly''' or confused with '''aphalangia''', the absence of the [[phalanx bone]] on one or (commonly) more digits. When ''all'' the digits on a hand or foot are absent, it is referred to as ''adactyly''.&lt;ref&gt;

====Ectrodactyly====
{{Main|Ectrodactyly}}
[[Ectrodactyly]], also known as ''split-hand malformation'', is the congenital absence of one or more central digits of the hands and feet. Consequently, it is a form of oligodactyly. News anchor [[Bree Walker]] is probably the best-known person with this condition, which affects about one in 91,000 people{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. It is conspicuously more common in the [[Vadoma]] in [[Zimbabwe]].

[[Image:Bird-feets-en.svg|thumb|Four types of bird feet&lt;br&gt;(right foot diagrams)]]

===Anisodactyly===
Anisodactyly is the most common arrangement of digits in birds, with three toes forward and one back. This is common in [[songbird]]s  and other [[perching bird]]s, as well as hunting birds like [[eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, and [[falcon]]s.
This occurs in [[Passeriformes]], [[Columbiformes]], [[falconiformes]], [[accipitriformes]], [[Galliformes]] and vast majority of birds.

===Syndactyly===
Syndactyly, as it occurs in birds, is like anisodactyly, except that the third and fourth toes (the outer and middle forward-pointing toes), or three toes, are fused together, as in the [[belted kingfisher]] (''Megaceryle alcyon''). This is characteristic of [[Coraciiformes]] ([[kingfisher]]s, [[bee-eater]]s, [[roller]]s, and relatives).

===Zygodactyly===
[[File:Ara chloropterus -Bioparc Zoo de Doue la Fontaine-8a.jpg|right|thumb|A [[green-winged macaw]] has raised its right foot to its beak.]]
Zygodactyly (from Greek ζυγος, [[even (disambiguation)|even]]) is an arrangement of digits in birds and chameleons, with two toes facing forward (digits 2 and 3) and two back (digits 1 and 4). This arrangement is most common in [[arboreal]] species, particularly those that climb [[tree]] trunks or clamber through foliage. Zygodactyly occurs in the [[parrot]]s, [[woodpecker]]s (including [[flicker (bird)|flicker]]s), [[cuckoo]]s (including [[Geococcyx|roadrunners]]), and some [[owls]].  Zygodactyl tracks have been found dating to 120–110 [[Megaannum#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]] (early [[Cretaceous]]), 50 million years before the first identified zygodactyl fossils. All [[Psittaciformes]], [[Cuculiformes]], the majority of [[Piciformes]] and the [[osprey]] are zygodactyl.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hl850l4128573g33/|title=Earliest zygodactyl bird feet: evidence from Early Cretaceous roadrunner-like tracks |journal=Naturwissenschaften|year=2007|doi=10.1007/s00114-007-0239-x|volume=94|pages=657–665|bibcode=2007NW.....94..657L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heterodactyly===
Heterodactyly is like zygodactyly, except that digits 3 and 4 point forward and digits 1 and 2 point back. This is found only in [[trogon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Botelho|first=João Francisco|last2=Smith-Paredes|first2=Daniel|last3=Nuñez-Leon|first3=Daniel|last4=Soto-Acuña|first4=Sergio|last5=Vargas|first5=Alexander O.|date=2014-08-07|title=The developmental origin of zygodactyl feet and its possible loss in the evolution of Passeriformes|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1788/20140765|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=281|issue=1788|pages=20140765|doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.0765|issn=0962-8452|pmc=4083792|pmid=24966313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pamprodactyly===
Pamprodactyly is an arrangement in which all four toes point forward, outer toes (toe 1 and sometimes 4) often if not regularly reversible. It is a characteristic of [[swift]]s (Apodidae) and [[mousebirds]] (Coliiformes).

==Chameleons==
The feet of [[chameleons]] are organized into bundles of a group of two and a group of three digits which oppose one another to grasp branches in a pincer-like arrangement.  This condition has been called zygodactyly or didactyly, however, the specific arrangement in chameleons does not fit either definition.  The feet of the front limbs in chameleons, for instance, are organized into a medial bundle of digits 1, 2 and 3, and a lateral bundle of digits 4 and 5, while the feet of the hind limbs are organized into a medial bundle of digits 1 and 2, and a lateral bundle of digits 3, 4 and 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Anderson, Christopher V. | author2= Higham, Timothy E. | last-author-amp= yes | chapter= Chameleon anatomy | editor1-last= Tolley | editor1-first= Krystal A. | editor2-last= Herrel | editor2-first= Anthony | title='''The Biology of Chameleons''' | publisher=University of California Press | year=2014 | location=Berkeley | pages= 7–55 | isbn= 9780520276055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zygodactyly by definition, on the other hand, involves digits 1 and 4 opposing digits 2 and 3, while chameleons do not exhibit this arrangement in either front or hind limbs. Further, didactyly involves only two digits per limb, while chameleons have five digits, despite being bundled into two opposing bundles.

==Schizodactyly==
'''Schizodactyly''' is a [[primate]] term for grasping and clinging with the second and third digit, instead of the thumb and second digit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3083">The '''derbfine''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|d|ɛr|ᵻ|ˈ|v|iː|n|ᵻ}}, {{lang-ga|dearbhfhine}} {{IPA-ga|dʲaɾˠəˈvˠiɲə}}, from ''derb'' 'real' + ''fine'' 'group of persons of the same family or kindred,' thus literally 'true kin'&lt;ref&gt;electronic Dictionary of the Irish Language s.v. [http://www.dil.ie/search?search_in=headword&amp;q=derbfine derbḟine]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a term for [[patrilineality|patrilineal group]]s and power structures defined in the first written tracts in [[Early Irish law]]. Its principal purpose was as an institution of property inheritance, with property redistributed on the death of a member to those remaining members of the derbfine. Comprising all the patrilineal descendants over a four-generation group with a common great-grandfather, it gradually gave way to a smaller three-generation kinship group, called the ''gelfine''.

Within a [[clan]], on the death of its chief or king, the surviving members of its derbfine would elect from their number a new chief and/or elect his successor, or ''[[Tánaiste]]'' (in English, his [[Tanistry|Tanist]]). A larger number of clan members, either allies or cousins who were too distantly related to be members of the derbfine, would not have a direct say in such an election. The frequent recitations of a clan's [[genealogy]] by its [[bard]]s was therefore a reminder of who was currently in or out of the clan's derbfine as much as it was a claim to ancient lineages.

Professor [[Francis John Byrne]] of [[University College Dublin]] also identified an ''indfine'' system used in some clans before the year 1000, with membership going back to a common great-great-great-grandfather, perhaps necessary at a time of frequent warfare.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Comparative systems==
In [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|later Anglo-Saxon England]], princes of the royal dynasty who were eligible for the kingship were known as [[ætheling]]s. In Wales, an [[edling]] was the term for an accepted [[heir apparent]] of a reigning Welsh monarch.

The inheritance of the Norman royal line on the death of [[Stephen, King of England]] and his succession by his cousin, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], is similar. Stephen's son was disinherited by consent and Henry was chosen as the equivalent of [[tanistry|tánaiste]] or next chieftain and succeeded to the English throne in 1154. The system was again attempted during the incapacity of [[Henry VI of England]], when the [[House of York]] obtained the support of some royal cousins to take the throne in 1461. By then the norm in Europe was the system of [[primogeniture]], which led on to the turbulent succession crises and policies of [[Henry VIII of England]] in 1527–36.

'''Environmental engineering science''' ('''EES''') is a [[multidisciplinary]] field of [[engineering science]] that combines the [[biological]], [[chemical]] and physical sciences with the field of engineering.  This major traditionally requires the student to take basic engineering classes in fields such as [[thermodynamics]], advanced [[math]], computer modeling and [[simulation]] and technical classes in subjects such as [[statics]], [[mechanics]], [[hydrology]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. As the student progresses, the upper division elective classes define a specific field of study for the student with a choice in a [[Environmental Engineering Science#Electives|range]] of science, technology and engineering related classes.&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt;

==Difference with related fields==
[[Image:CalifAcadSciRoof 0820.JPG|thumb|right|Graduates of Environmental Engineering Science can go on to work on the technical aspects of designing a [[Green roof|Living Roof]] like the one pictured here at the [[California Academy of Science|California Academy of the Sciences]]]]
As a recently created program, environmental engineering science has not yet been incorporated into the terminology found among [[Environment (biophysical)|environmentally]] focused professionals.  In the few engineering colleges that offer this major, the curriculum shares more classes in common with [[environmental engineering]] than it does with [[environmental science]].  Typically, EES students follow a similar course curriculum with environmental engineers until their fields diverge during the last year of college.  The majority of the environmental engineering students must take classes designed to connect their knowledge of the environment to modern [[building materials]] and [[construction]] methods.  This is meant to direct the environmental engineer into a field where they will more than likely assist in building [[wastewater treatment|treatment facilities]], preparing [[environmental impact assessment]]s or helping to mitigate [[air pollution]] from specific point sources.

Meanwhile, the environmental engineering science student will choose a direction for their [[career]].  From the range of electives they have to choose from, these students can move into a fields such as the design of [[Radioactive waste|nuclear storage facilities]], bacterial [[bioreactors]] or [[environmental policies]]. These students combine the practical design background of an engineer with the detailed theory found in many of the [[biology|biological]] and [[physical sciences]].

==Description at universities==
===Stanford University===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Civil and Environmental Engineering department at Stanford University provides the following description for their program in Environmental Engineering and Science:
The Environmental Engineering and Science (EES) program focuses on the chemical and biological processes involved in water quality engineering, water and air pollution, remediation and hazardous substance control, human exposure to pollutants, environmental biotechnology, and environmental protection.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


===UC Berkeley===
The College of Engineering at [[UC Berkeley]] defines Environmental Engineering Science, including the following:&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{cite news|pages=27–28 |title=Engineering Announcement 2008-2009 |url=http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/EngAnn08.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203005457/http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/EngAnn08.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is a multidisciplinary field requiring an integration of physical, chemical and biological principles with engineering analysis for environmental protection and restoration. The program incorporates courses from many departments on campus to create a discipline that is rigorously based in science and engineering, while addressing a wide variety of environmental issues. Although an environmental engineering option exists within the civil engineering major, the engineering science curriculum provides a more broadly based foundation in the sciences than is possible in civil engineering
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Massachusetts Institute of Technology===

At [[MIT]], the major is described in their curriculum, including the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MIT Course Catalog: Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. |url=http://web.mit.edu/catalogue/degre.engin.civil.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Bachelor of Science in Environmental Engineering Science emphasizes the fundamental physical, chemical, and biological processes necessary for understanding the interactions between man and the environment. Issues considered include the provision of clean and reliable water supplies, flood forecasting and protection, development of renewable and nonrenewable energy sources, causes and implications of climate change, and the impact of human activities on natural cycles
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Vacuum distillation of DMSO at 70C.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Wet labs are required as part of the lower division curriculum]]

==Lower division coursework==

Lower division coursework in this field requires the student to take several laboratory-based classes in calculus-based physics, chemistry, biology, [[Mathematical programming|programming]] and [[analysis]].  This is intended to give the student background information in order to introduce them to the engineering fields and to prepare them for more technical information in their upper division coursework.

==Upper division coursework==
[[Image:FAE visualization.jpg|left|thumb|Students learn to integrate their math and statistics with software to perform analysis of physical [[systems]] like the [[Finite Element Analysis]] shown above]]
The upper division classes in Environmental Engineering Science prepares the student for work in the fields of engineering and science with coursework in subjects including the following:&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt;

*[[Fluid mechanics]]
*[[Mechanics]] of materials

==Post graduation work==

The multidisciplinary approach in Environmental Engineering Science gives the student expertise in technical fields related to their own personal interest.  While some graduates choose to use this major to go to graduate school,&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt; students who choose to work often go into the fields of [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[environmental engineering]], [[biotechnology]], and research.  However, the less technical math, programming and writing background gives the students opportunities to pursue [[information technology|IT]] work and [[technical writing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5392">In [[molecular biology]], an '''exonic splicing enhancer''' (ESE) is a DNA [[sequence motif]] consisting of 6 bases within an [[exon]] that directs, or enhances, accurate [[splicing (genetics)|splicing]] of heterogeneous nuclear RNA ([[hnRNA]]) or [[pre-mRNA]] into messenger RNA ([[mRNA]]). 
 
== Introduction ==

{{Disputed section|date=September 2015}}
{{Main article|RNA splicing}}
The [[central dogma of molecular biology]] states that all of the information that makes you unique is housed in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of every [[cell (biology)|cell]] in your body in the form of [[DNA]]. The human DNA is a string of 3.2 billion [[base pairs]].  Short sequences of DNA are transcribed to [[RNA]]; then this RNA is translated to a [[protein]].  A gene located in the DNA will contain [[introns]] and [[exons]].  Part of the process of preparing the RNA includes [[splicing (genetics)|splicing]] out the introns, sections of RNA that do not code for the protein. The presence of exonic splicing enhancers is essential for proper identification of splice sites by the cellular machinery.

== Role in splicing ==
{{Main article|SR protein}}
[[SR protein]]s bind to and promote exon splicing in regions with ESEs, while [[heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle]]s (hnRNPs) bind to and block exon splicing in regions with [[exonic splicing silencer]]s.  Both types of proteins are involved in the assembly and proper functioning of [[spliceosome]]s.&lt;ref name="zhu2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhu|first1=Jun|last2=Mayeda|first2=Akila|last3=Krainer|first3=Adrian R.|author-link3=Adrian R. Krainer|date=December 2001|title=Exon Identity Established through Differential Antagonism between Exonic Splicing Silencer-Bound hnRNP A1 and Enhancer-Bound SR Proteins|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276501004099|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=8|issue=6|pages=1351–1361|doi=10.1016/S1097-2765(01)00409-9|accessdate=12 December 2014|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[RNA splicing]], [[U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1]] (U2AF35) and [[U2AF2]] (U2AF65) interact with the branch site and the 3' splice site of the intron to form the lariat.  It is thought that SR proteins that bind to ESEs promote exon splicing by increasing interactions with U2AF35 and U2AF65.&lt;ref name=cartegni2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cartegni|first1=Luca|last2=Chew|first2=Shern L.|last3=Krainer|first3=Adrian R.|title=Listening to silence and understanding nonsense: exonic mutations that affect splicing|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=1 April 2002|volume=3|issue=4|pages=285–298|doi=10.1038/nrg775|url=http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v3/n4/full/nrg775.html|accessdate=17 December 2014|pmid=11967553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutation of exonic splicing enhancer motifs is a significant contributor to genetic disorders and some cancers. Simple point mutations in ESEs can inhibit affinity for splicing factors and alter [[alternative splicing]], leading to altered mRNA sequence and protein translation. A field of genetic research is dedicated to determining the location and significance of ESE motifs [[in vivo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fairbrother|first=William G.|last2=Yeo|first2=Gene W.|last3=Yeh|first3=Rufang|last4=Goldstein|first4=Paul|last5=Mawson|first5=Matthew|last6=Sharp|first6=Phillip A.|last7=Burge|first7=Christopher B.|date=2004-07-01|title=RESCUE-ESE identifies candidate exonic splicing enhancers in vertebrate exons|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=32|issue=Web Server issue|pages=W187–W190|doi=10.1093/nar/gkh393|issn=0305-1048|pmc=441531|pmid=15215377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Computational methods were used to identify 238 candidate ESEs{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}. ESEs are clinically significant because synonymous point mutations previously thought to be [[silent mutations]] located in an ESEs can lead to exon skipping and the production of a non functioning protein.

Disruption of an exon splicing enhancer in exon 3 of [[MLH1]] gene is the cause of [[HNPCC]] (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) in a Quebec family.&lt;ref name=mcvety2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McVety|first1=S|last2=Li|first2=L|last3=Gordon|first3=P H|last4=Chong|first4=G|last5=Foulkes|first5=W D|title=Disruption of an exon splicing enhancer in exon 3 of MLH1 is the cause of HNPCC in a Quebec family|journal=Journal of Medical Genetics|date=17 June 2005|volume=43|issue=2|pages=153–156|doi=10.1136/jmg.2005.031997|url=http://jmg.bmj.com/content/43/2/153.long|accessdate=12 December 2014|pmid=15923275|pmc=2564635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fire protection''' is the study and practice of mitigating the unwanted effects of potentially [[Conflagration|destructive fires]].&lt;ref&gt;NFPA Fire Protection Handbook, pg. 2-19&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the study of the behaviour, [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)|compartmentalisation]], suppression and investigation of [[fire]] and its related emergencies, as well as the research and development, production, testing and application of mitigating [[system]]s. In structures, be they land-based, offshore or even ships, the owners and operators are responsible to maintain their facilities in accordance with a design-basis that is rooted in laws, including the local [[building code]] and fire code, which are enforced by the [[Authority Having Jurisdiction]].

Buildings must be constructed in accordance with the version of the building code that is in effect when an application for a building permit is made. Building inspectors check on compliance of a building under [[construction]] with the building code. Once [[construction]] is complete, a building must be maintained in accordance with the current fire code, which is enforced by the fire prevention officers of a local fire department. In the event of fire emergencies, [[Firefighter]]s, fire investigators, and other fire prevention personnel are called to mitigate, investigate and learn from the [[Fire damage|damage of a fire]]. Lessons learned from fires are applied to the authoring of both building codes and fire codes.

==Classifying fires==
{{Main|Fire class}}
When deciding on what fire protection is appropriate for any given situation, it is important to assess the types of fire hazard that may be faced.

Some jurisdictions operate systems of classifying fires using code letters.  Whilst these may agree on some classifications, they also vary.  Below is a table showing the standard operated in Europe and Australia against the system used in the United States.

{| class="wikitable"
|-

! Type of Fire

|-
| Fires that involve flammable [[solid]]s such as [[wood]], [[cloth]], [[rubber]], [[paper]], and some types of [[plastic]]s.
| Class A

| Class E&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
| (Class E) now no longer in the European standards
| Class C
|-
| Fires involving cooking fats and oils. The high temperature of the oils when on fire far exceeds that of other flammable liquids, making normal extinguishing agents ineffective.
| Class F
| Class F
| Class K
|}

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;Technically there is no such thing as a "Class E" fire, as electricity itself does not burn. However it is considered a dangerous and very deadly complication to a fire, therefore using the incorrect extinguishing method can result in serious injury or death. Class E, however generally refers to fires involving electricity, therefore a bracketed E, "(E)" denoted on various types of extinguishers.&lt;ref&gt;New South Wales Rural Fire Service VF - (2005) Village Firefighter Manual, pg 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Fires are sometimes categorized as "one alarm", "two alarm", "three alarm" (or higher) fires. There is no standard definition for what this means quantifiably, though it always refers to the level response by the local authorities. In some cities, the numeric rating refers to the number of fire stations that have been summoned to the fire. In others, the number counts the number of "dispatches" for additional personnel and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc4.com/money/9208480/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123185444/http://www.nbc4.com/money/9208480/detail.html |archivedate=2007-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevillager.com/villager_39/fouralarmfire.html|title=Four-alarm fire on Avenue B|author=|date=|website=www.thevillager.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
[[File:Fire training alarm in KarRC RAS 2018.ogg|thumb|Personnel training and fire training alarm in [[Karelian Research Centre of RAS]], 2018.]]

Fire protection in land-based [[building]]s, [[offshore construction]] or onboard [[ship]]s is typically achieved via all of the following:
* [[Passive fire protection]] - the installation of [[firewall (construction)|firewalls]] and fire rated floor assemblies to form fire compartments intended to limit the spread of [[fire]], high temperatures, and [[smoke]].
* [[Active fire protection]] - manual and automatic detection and suppression of fires, such as [[fire sprinkler]] systems and ([[fire alarm]]) systems. 
* [[Education]] - the provision of information regarding passive and active fire protection systems to building owners, operators, occupants, and emergency personnel so that they have a working understanding of the intent of these systems and how they perform in the [[fire safety plan]].

==Balanced Approach==
Passive fire protection (PFP) in the form of compartmentalisation was developed prior to the invention of or widespread use of active fire protection (AFP), mainly in the form of automatic fire sprinkler systems. During this time, PFP was the dominant mode of protection provided in facility designs. With the widespread installation of fire sprinklers in the past 50 years, the reliance on PFP as the only approach was reduced.
Lobby groups are typically divided into two camps favouring active or [[passive fire protection]]. Each camp tries to garner more business for itself through its influence in establishing or changing local and national building and fire codes.  

The relatively recent inclusion of ''performance based'' or ''objective based'' codes, which have a greater emphasis on life safety than property protection, tend to support AFP initiatives, and can lead to the justification for a lesser degree of fire resistant rated construction. At times it works the other way around, as [[Firewall (construction)|firewalls]] that protrude through the [[roof]] structure are used to "sub-divide" [[building]]s such that the separated parts are of smaller area and contain smaller fire hazards, and do not necessarily require sprinklers.

The decision to favour AFP versus PFP in the design of a new building may be affected by the lifecycle costs.  Lifecycle costs can be shifted from capital to operational budgets and vice versa.

==Building Operation in conformance with Design==
'''Fire protection''' within a structure is a [[system]] that relies on all of its components. The building is designed in compliance with the local [[building code]] and [[fire code]] by the architect and other consultants. A building permit is issued after review by the [[Authority Having Jurisdiction|Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)]].

Deviations from that original plan should be made known to the AHJ to make sure that the change is still in compliance with the law to prevent any unsafe conditions that may violate the law and put people at risk. For example, if the [[firestop]] systems in a structure were inoperable, a significant part of the fire safety plan might be compromised in the event of a fire because the walls and floors that contain the firestops are intended to have a [[fire-resistance rating]]. Likewise, if the [[Fire sprinkler|sprinkler system]] or fire alarm system is inoperable for lack of proper maintenance, the likelihood of damage or personal injury is increased.

'''Flue-gas desulfurization''' ('''FGD''') is a set of technologies used to remove [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|SO|2}}) from [[Flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion|exhaust flue gases of fossil-fuel power plant]]s, and from the emissions of other sulfur oxide emitting processes (e.g [[trash incineration]])

As stringent environmental regulations regarding SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have been enacted in many countries, {{chem|SO|2}} is now being removed from flue gases by a variety of methods. Below are common methods used:

*[[Wet scrubber|Wet scrubbing]] using a slurry of alkaline [[sorbent]], usually [[limestone]] or [[lime (mineral)|lime]], or seawater to scrub gases;
*[[Spray drying|Spray-dry]] scrubbing using similar sorbent slurries;
*[[Wet sulfuric acid process]] recovering [[sulfur]] in the form of commercial quality [[sulfuric acid]];
*[[SNOX process|SNOX Flue gas desulfurization]] removes sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates from flue gases;
*Dry sorbent injection systems that introduce powdered hydrated lime (or other sorbent material) into exhaust ducts to eliminate SO2 and SO3 from process emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nol-tec.com/documents/pdfs/NTS_FGD_02_09_B.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

For a typical coal-fired power station, flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) may remove 90 percent or more of the {{chem|SO|2}} in the flue gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.compositech-filters.com/power-exhaust-filters|title=Flue Gas Desulfurization - FGD Wastewater Treatment {{!}} Compositech Filters Manufacturer|last=Inc.|first=Compositech Products Manufacturing,|website=www.compositech-filters.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Methods of removing [[sulfur dioxide]] from boiler and furnace exhaust gases have been studied for over 150 years.  Early ideas for flue gas desulfurization were established in [[England]] around 1850.

With the construction of large-scale power plants in England in the 1920s, the problems associated with large volumes of {{chem|SO|2}} from a single site began to concern the public.  The {{chem|SO|2}} emissions problem did not receive much attention until 1929, when the [[House of Lords]] upheld the claim of a landowner against the Barton Electricity Works of the [[Manchester Corporation]] for damages to his land resulting from {{chem|SO|2}} emissions.  Shortly thereafter, a press campaign was launched against the erection of power plants within the confines of London.  This outcry led to the imposition of {{chem|SO|2}} controls on all such power plants.&lt;ref name=Biondo&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Biondo |first1=S.J. |last2=Marten |first2=J.C. |title=A History of Flue Gas Desulphurization Systems Since 1850 |journal=Journal of the Air Pollution Control Association |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=948–61 |date=October 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major FGD unit at a utility was installed in 1931 at [[Battersea Power Station]], owned by [[London Power Company]].  In 1935, an FGD system similar to that installed at Battersea went into service at Swansea Power Station.  The third major FGD system was installed in 1938 at [[Fulham Power Station]]. These three early large-scale FGD installations were abandoned during [[World War II]].  Large-scale FGD units did not reappear at utilities until the 1970s, where most of the installations occurred in the [[United States]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=Biondo/&gt;

As of June 1973, there were 42 FGD units in operation, 36 in Japan and 6 in the United States, ranging in capacity from 5 [[Megawatt|MW]] to 250 MW.&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;Beychok, Milton R., ''Coping With SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', Chemical Engineering/Deskbook Issue, 21 October 1974&lt;/ref&gt; As of around 1999 and 2000, FGD units were being used in 27 countries, and there were 678 FGD units operating at a total power plant capacity of about 229 [[gigawatts]]. About 45% of the FGD capacity was in the U.S., 24% in [[Germany]], 11% in Japan, and 20% in various other countries. Approximately 79% of the units, representing about 199 gigawatts of capacity, were using lime or limestone wet scrubbing. About 18% (or 25 gigawatts) utilized spray-dry scrubbers or sorbent injection systems.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;Nolan, Paul S., ''Flue Gas Desulfurization Technologies for Coal-Fired Power Plants'', The Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company, U.S., presented by Michael X.

==Sulfuric acid mist formation==
[[Fossil fuel]]s such as coal and oil can contain a significant amount of sulfur. When fossil fuels are burned, about 95 percent or more of the sulfur is generally converted to [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|SO|2}}). Such conversion happens under normal conditions of temperature and of oxygen present in the [[flue gas]]. However, there are circumstances under which such reaction may not occur.

When flue gas has too much oxygen, the {{chem|SO|2}} further oxidizes into [[sulfur trioxide]] ({{chem|SO|3}}). Too much oxygen is only one of the ways that {{chem|SO|3}} is formed. Gas temperature is also an important factor. At about 800&amp;nbsp;°C, formation of {{chem|SO|3}} is favored. Another way that {{chem|SO|3}} can be formed is through catalysis by metals in the fuel. Such reaction is particularly true for heavy fuel oil, where a significant amount of [[vanadium]] is present. In whatever way {{chem|SO|3}} is formed, it does not behave like {{chem|SO|2}} in that it forms a liquid [[aerosol]] known as [[sulfuric acid]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}) mist that is very difficult to remove. Generally, about 1% of the sulfur dioxide will be converted to {{chem|SO|3}}. Sulfuric acid mist is often the cause of the blue haze that often appears as the flue gas plume dissipates. Increasingly, this problem is being addressed by the use of wet [[electrostatic precipitator]]s.

== FGD chemistry ==

=== Basic principles ===
Most FGD systems employ two stages: one for [[fly ash]] removal and the other for {{chem|SO|2}} removal. Attempts have been made to remove both the fly ash and {{chem|SO|2}} in one scrubbing vessel. However, these systems experienced severe maintenance problems and low removal efficiency. In wet scrubbing systems, the flue gas normally passes first through a fly ash removal device, either an electrostatic precipitator or a baghouse, and then into the {{chem|SO|2}}-absorber. However, in dry injection or spray drying operations, the {{chem|SO|2}} is first reacted with the lime, and then the flue gas passes through a particulate control device.

Another important design consideration associated with wet FGD systems is that the flue gas exiting the absorber is saturated with water and still contains some {{chem|SO|2}}. These gases are highly corrosive to any downstream equipment such as fans, ducts, and stacks. Two methods that may minimize corrosion are: (1) reheating the gases to above their [[dew point]], or (2) using materials of construction and designs that allow equipment to withstand the corrosive conditions. Both alternatives are expensive. Engineers determine which method to use on a site-by-site basis.

=== Scrubbing with an alkali solid or solution ===
[[File:Flue gas desulfurization unit EN.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Schematic design of the absorber of an FGD]]
{{chem|SO|2}} is an [[acid gas]], and, therefore, the typical sorbent slurries or other materials used to remove the {{chem|SO|2}} from the flue gases are alkaline. The reaction taking place in wet scrubbing using a {{chem|CaCO|3}} ([[limestone]]) slurry produces [[calcium sulfite]] ({{chem|CaSO|3}}) and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as:

:{{chem|CaCO|3}}{{sub|(s)}} + {{chem|SO|2}}{{sub|(g)}} → {{chem|CaSO|3}}{{sub|(s)}} + {{CO2}}{{sub|(g)}}

When wet scrubbing with a Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[hydrated lime]]) slurry, the reaction also produces CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[calcium sulfite]]) and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as:

:Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(s)}} + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(s)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}}

When wet scrubbing with a Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[magnesium hydroxide]]) slurry, the reaction produces MgSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[magnesium sulfite]]) and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as:

:Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(s)}} + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → MgSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(s)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}}

To partially offset the cost of the FGD installation, some designs, particularly dry sorbent injection systems, further oxidize the CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (calcium sulfite) to produce marketable CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ([[gypsum]]) that can be of high enough quality to use in [[wallboard]] and other products. The process by which this synthetic gypsum is created is also known as forced oxidation:

:CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(aq)}} + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}} + ½O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; · 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(s)}}

A natural alkaline usable to absorb SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is seawater. The {{chem|SO|2}} is absorbed in the water, and when oxygen is added reacts to form sulfate ions SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;- and free H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The surplus of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is offset by the carbonates in seawater pushing the carbonate equilibrium to release {{CO2}} gas:

:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}} + ½O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;{{sub|(aq)}} + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

:HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}} + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}}

In industry [[Caustic soda|caustic]] (NaOH) is often used to scrub {{chem|SO|2}}, producing [[sodium sulfite]]:

:2NaOH{{sub|(aq)}} + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(aq)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}}&lt;ref name="RJC"&gt;[http://rasayanjournal.co.in/vol-3/issue-2/23.pdf] REMOVAL OF SULPHUR DIOXIDE FROM FLUE GASES IN

==== Types of wet scrubbers used in FGD ====
To promote maximum [[Liquid-to-gas ratio|gas–liquid surface area]] and residence time, a number of wet scrubber designs have been used, including spray towers, venturis, plate towers, and mobile [[packed bed]]s. Because of scale buildup, plugging, or erosion, which affect FGD dependability and absorber efficiency, the trend is to use simple scrubbers such as spray towers instead of more complicated ones. The configuration of the tower may be vertical or horizontal, and flue gas can flow cocurrently, countercurrently, or crosscurrently with respect to the liquid. The chief drawback of spray towers is that they require a higher liquid-to-gas ratio requirement for equivalent {{chem|SO|2}} removal than other absorber designs.

FGD scrubbers produce a scaling wastewater that requires treatment to meet discharge regulations.&lt;ref name="EPA reg"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. [http://www2.epa.gov/eg/steam-electric-power-generating-effluent-guidelines-2015-final-rule "Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category."] Final Rule. 2015-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt; However, technological advancements in [[ion exchange membranes]] and [[electrodialysis]] systems has enabled high-efficiency treatment of FGD wastewater to meet recent EPA discharge limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lowering Cost and Waste in Flue Gas Desulfurization Wastewater Treatment|url=http://www.powermag.com/lowering-cost-waste-flue-gas-desulfurization-wastewater-treatment/|website=Power Mag|publisher=Electric Power|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment approach is similar for other highly scaling industrial wastewaters.

=====Venturi-rod scrubbers=====
{{main|venturi scrubber}}
A [[venturi scrubber]] is a converging/diverging section of duct. The converging section accelerates the gas stream to high velocity. When the liquid stream is injected at the throat, which is the point of maximum velocity, the turbulence caused by the high gas velocity atomizes the liquid into small droplets, which creates the surface area necessary for mass transfer to take place. The higher the pressure drop in the venturi, the smaller the droplets and the higher the surface area. The penalty is in power consumption.

For simultaneous removal of {{chem|SO|2}} and fly ash, venturi scrubbers can be used. In fact, many of the industrial sodium-based throwaway systems are venturi scrubbers originally designed to remove particulate matter. These units were slightly modified to inject a sodium-based scrubbing liquor. Although removal of both particles and {{chem|SO|2}} in one vessel can be economic, the problems of high pressure drops and finding a scrubbing medium to remove heavy loadings of fly ash must be considered. However, in cases where the particle concentration is low, such as from oil-fired units, it can be more effective to remove particulate and {{chem|SO|2}} simultaneously.

=====Packed bed scrubbers=====
A packed scrubber consists of a tower with packing material inside. This packing material can be in the shape of saddles, rings, or some highly specialized shapes designed to maximize the contact area between the dirty gas and liquid. Packed towers typically operate at much lower pressure drops than venturi scrubbers and are therefore cheaper to operate. They also typically offer higher {{chem|SO|2}} removal efficiency. The drawback is that they have a greater tendency to plug up if particles are present in excess in the exhaust air stream.

=====Spray towers=====
{{main|spray tower}}
A [[spray tower]] is the simplest type of scrubber. It consists of a tower with spray nozzles, which generate the droplets for surface contact. [[Spray tower]]s are typically used when circulating a slurry (see below). The high speed of a venturi would cause erosion problems, while a packed tower would plug up if it tried to circulate a slurry.

Counter-current packed towers are infrequently used because they have a tendency to become plugged by collected particles or to scale when [[lime (mineral)|lime]] or [[limestone]] scrubbing slurries are used.

==== Scrubbing reagent ====

As explained above, alkaline sorbents are used for scrubbing flue gases to remove SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Depending on the application, the two most important are [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] and [[sodium hydroxide]] (also known as [[caustic soda]]). Lime is typically used on large coal- or oil-fired boilers as found in power plants, as it is very much less expensive than caustic soda. The problem is that it results in a slurry being circulated through the scrubber instead of a solution. This makes it harder on the equipment. A spray tower is typically used for this application. The use of lime results in a slurry of calcium sulfite (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) that must be disposed of. Fortunately, calcium sulfite can be oxidized to produce by-product gypsum (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; · 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) which is marketable for use in the building products industry.

Caustic soda is limited to smaller combustion units because it is more expensive than lime, but it has the advantage that it forms a solution rather than a slurry. This makes it easier to operate. It produces a "[[spent caustic]]" solution of [[sodium sulfite]]/bisulfite (depending on the pH), or sodium sulfate that must be disposed of.  This is not a problem in a [[kraft pulp]] mill for example, where this can be a source of makeup chemicals to the recovery cycle.

=== Scrubbing with sodium sulfite solution ===

It is possible to scrub [[sulfur dioxide]] by using a cold solution of [[sodium sulfite]]; this forms a sodium hydrogen sulfite solution. By heating this solution it is possible to reverse the reaction to form sulfur dioxide and the sodium sulfite solution. Since the sodium sulfite solution is not consumed, it is called a regenerative treatment. The application of this reaction is also known as the [[Wellman–Lord process]].

In some ways this can be thought of as being similar to the reversible [[liquid–liquid extraction]] of an [[inert gas]] such as [[xenon]] or [[radon]] (or some other solute which does not undergo a chemical change during the extraction) from water to another phase. While a chemical change does occur during the extraction of the sulfur dioxide from the gas mixture, it is the case that the extraction equilibrium is shifted by changing the temperature rather than by the use of a chemical reagent.

=== Gas phase oxidation followed by reaction with ammonia ===

A new, emerging flue gas desulfurization technology has been described by the [[IAEA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-tc.iaea.org/tcweb/publications/factsheets/sheet16p.pdf IAEA Factsheet] about pilot plant in Poland.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[radiation]] technology where an intense beam of [[electrons]] is fired into the flue gas at the same time as [[ammonia]] is added to the gas. The Chendu power plant in China started up such a flue gas desulfurization unit on a 100 MW scale in 1998.  The Pomorzany power plant in Poland also started up a similar sized unit in 2003 and that plant removes both sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Both plants are reported to be operating successfully.&lt;ref name=Wu&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/36/116/36116306.pdf |chapter=Electron beam application in gas waste treatment in China |last1=Haifeng |first1=Wu |publisher=INET Tsinghua University |location=Beijing, China |title=Proceedings of the FNCA 2002 workshop on application of electron accelerator}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IAEA&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Reports/Anrep2003/physical.pdf Section of IAEA 2003 Annual Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221100739/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Reports/Anrep2003/physical.pdf |date=21 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the accelerator design principles and manufacturing quality need further improvement for continuous operation in industrial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ichtj.waw.pl/ichtj/nukleon/back/full/vol50_2005/v50s3p17f.pdf ''Application of ionizing radiation to environmental protection''] by A.G. Chmielewski, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland.&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[radioactivity]] is required or created in the process. The electron beam is generated by a device similar to the [[electron gun]] in a TV set. This device is called an accelerator. This is an example of a radiation chemistry process&lt;ref name=IAEA/&gt; where the physical effects of radiation are used to process a substance.

The action of the electron beam is to promote the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur(VI) compounds. The ammonia reacts with the sulfur compounds thus formed to produce [[ammonium sulfate]], which can be used as a nitrogenous [[fertilizer]]. In addition, it can be used to lower the nitrogen oxide content of the flue gas. This method has attained industrial plant scale.&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=20634234 ''Industrial Plant for Flue Gas Treatment with High Power Electron Accelerator''] by A.G. Chmielewski, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts and statistics==
:''The information in this section was obtained from a US EPA published fact sheet.''&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/catc/dir1/ffdg.pdf Air Pollution Control Fact Sheet] US EPA date coded 2003, accessed 24 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Flue gas desulfurization scrubbers have been applied to combustion units firing coal and oil that range in size from 5 MW to 1500 MW. [[Scottish Power]] are spending £400 million installing FGD at [[Longannet power station]], which has a capacity of over 2 GW. Dry scrubbers and spray scrubbers have generally been applied to units smaller than 300 MW.

FGD has been fitted by [[RWE npower]] at [[Aberthaw Power Station]] in south Wales using the seawater process and works successfully on the 1580MW plant.

Approximately 85% of the flue gas desulfurization units installed in the US are wet scrubbers, 12% are spray dry systems, and 3% are dry injection systems.

The highest {{chem|SO|2}} removal efficiencies (greater than 90%) are achieved by wet scrubbers and the lowest (less than 80%) by dry scrubbers. However, the newer designs for dry scrubbers are capable of achieving efficiencies in the order of 90%.

In spray drying and dry injection systems, the flue gas must first be cooled to about 10–20&amp;nbsp;°C above [[adiabatic]] [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturation]] to avoid wet solids deposition on downstream equipment and plugging of baghouses.

The capital, operating and maintenance costs per [[short ton]] of {{chem|SO|2}} removed (in 2001 US dollars) are:

*For wet scrubbers larger than 400 MW, the cost is $200 to $500 per ton
*For wet scrubbers smaller than 400 MW, the cost is $500 to $5,000 per ton
*For spray dry scrubbers larger than 200 MW, the cost is $150 to $300 per ton
*For spray dry scrubbers smaller than 200 MW, the cost is $500 to $4,000 per ton

== Alternative methods of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions==

An alternative to removing [[sulfur]] from the flue gases after burning is to remove the sulfur from the fuel before or during combustion.  [[Hydrodesulfurization]] of fuel has been used for treating [[fuel oil]]s before use.  [[Fluidized bed combustion]] adds lime to the fuel during combustion. The lime reacts with the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form [[sulfate]]s which become part of the [[Coal assay#Ash|ash]].
This elemental sulfur is then separated and finally recovered at the end of the process for further usage in, for example, agricultural products. Safety is one of the greatest benefits of this method, as the whole process takes place at [[atmospheric pressure]] and ambient temperature. This method has been developed by Paqell, a joint venture between [[Shell Global Solutions]] and Paques.&lt;ref name=Paqell&gt;[http://paqell.com/thiopaq/process-description/ THIOPAQ Oil &amp; Gas process description and flow diagram] – official Paqell website&lt;/ref&gt;

Language fluency is sometimes contrasted with accuracy (or correctness of language use, especially grammatical correctness)&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; and complexity (or a more encompassing knowledge of vocabulary and discourse strategies).&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt; Fluency, accuracy, and complexity are distinct but interrelated components of [[language acquisition]] and [[Language proficiency|proficiency]].

=== Types of fluency ===
There are four commonly discussed types of fluency: reading fluency, oral fluency, oral-reading fluency, and written or compositional fluency. These types of fluency are interrelated, but do not necessarily develop in tandem or linearly. One may develop fluency in certain type(s) and be less fluent or nonfluent in others.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

In the sense of proficiency, "fluency" encompasses a number of related but separable skills:
* '''Reading fluency''' refers to the link between the recognition of words while reading and [[reading comprehension]],&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rasinski/&gt; which manifests itself in the speed and accuracy that one is able to read text.&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt; Research on reading fluency aligns concepts of accuracy, automaticity, and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].&lt;ref name=Rasinski/&gt;  To achieve reading fluency, readers must have knowledge of the content of the language as well as the [[vocabulary]] being used. Interventions designed to help children learn to read fluently generally include some form of repeated reading, but this process may differ for children with [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], who may struggle with reading fluency.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;
* '''Oral fluency''' or '''speaking fluency''' is a measurement both of production and reception of [[speech]], as a fluent speaker must be able to understand and respond to others in conversation. [[Spoken language]] is typically characterized by seemingly non-fluent qualities (e.g., fragmentation, pauses, false starts, hesitation, repetition) because of ‘task stress.’ How orally fluent one is can therefore be understood in terms of perception, and whether these qualities of speech can be perceived as expected and natural (i.e., fluent) or unusual and problematic (i.e., non-fluent).&lt;ref name=Guillot&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44961785|title=Fluency and its teaching|author=Guillot, Marie-Noëlle,|date=1999|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=1853594393|location=Clevedon, U.K.|oclc=44961785}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Oral reading fluency''' is sometimes distinguished from oral fluency. Oral reading fluency refers to the ability to read words accurately and quickly while using good vocal expression and phrasing.&lt;ref name=Rasinski&gt;{{cite book |author=Rasinski, T. V. |year=2006 |chapter=A brief history of reading fluency |editor1=Samuels, S. |author2=Farstrup, A. |title=What research has to say about fluency instruction |pages=70–93 |location=Newark, DE |publisher=International Reading Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral reading fluency is often linked to Schreiber’s Theory of Prosody, which places importance on the [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], rhythm, and expressiveness of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schreiber|first=Peter A.|date=1991-06-01|title=Understanding prosody's role in reading acquisition|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405849109543496|journal=Theory Into Practice|volume=30|issue=3|pages=158–164|doi=10.1080/00405849109543496|issn=0040-5841}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Written or compositional fluency''' can be measured in a variety of ways. Researchers have measured by length of the [[Composition (language)|composition]] (especially under timed conditions), words produced per minute, sentence length, or words per clause. Ratio measures (e.g., words per clause, words per sentence, and words per error-free sentence) have historically been most valid and reliable.&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40664312|title=Second language development in writing : measures of fluency, accuracy, &amp; complexity|author1=Wolfe-Quintero, Kate|date=1998|publisher=Second Language Teaching &amp; Curriculum Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa|author2=Shunji, Inagaki |author3=Hae-Young, Kim|isbn=9780824820695|location=Honolulu|oclc=40664312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluency in second-language acquisition ===

Because an assessment of fluency is typically a measure or characterization of one's language ability, determining fluency may be a more challenging task when the speaker is acquiring a second language. It is generally thought that the later in life a learner approaches the study of a foreign language, the harder it is to acquire receptive  ([[Hearing (sense)|auditory]]) comprehension and fluent production (speaking) skills. For adults, once their mother tongue has already been established, the acquisition of a second language can come more slowly and less completely, ultimately affecting fluency. However, the [[critical period hypothesis]] is a hotly debated topic, with some scholars stating that adults can in fact become fluent in acquiring a second language. For instance, reading and writing skills in a foreign language can be acquired more easily even after the primary [[language acquisition]] period of youth is over.&lt;ref name=harrell/&gt;

So although it is often assumed that young children learn languages more easily than adolescents and adults,{{sfn|McLaughlin|1992}}{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}} the reverse is in fact true; older learners are faster. The only exception to this rule is in [[pronunciation]]. Young children invariably learn to speak their second language with native-like pronunciation, whereas learners who start learning a language at an older age only rarely reach a native-like level.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}}

====Second-language acquisition in children====

Since childhood is a [[critical period]], widespread opinion holds that it is easier for young children to learn a second language than it is for adults.  Children can even acquire native fluency when exposed to the language on a consistent basis with rich interaction in a social setting.  In addition to capacity, factors like; 1) motivation, 2) aptitude, 3) personality characteristics, 4) age of acquisition 5) first language typology 6) socio-economic status and 7) quality and context of L2 input play a role in L2 acquisitions rate and building fluency.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jparadis/Johanne_Paradis_Homepage/Publications_files/P_CSLA_Handbook.pdf|title=Second Language Acquisition in Childhood|last=Paradis|first=Johanne|date=August 2006|website=University of Alberta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509173500/https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jparadis/Johanne_Paradis_Homepage/Publications_files/P_CSLA_Handbook.pdf|archive-date=2018-05-09|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second language acquisition (SLA) has the ability to influence children’s cognitive growth and linguistic development.

Skill that consists of ability to produce words in target language develops until adolescence.  Natural ability to acquire a new language with a deliberate effort may begin to diminish around puberty i.e. 12–14 years of age.  Learning environment, comprehensible instructional materials, teacher, and the learner are indispensable elements in SLA and developing fluency in children.  Extensive reading in L2 can offer twofold benefits in foreign language learning i.e. "reading to comprehend English and reading to learn English".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d3d3/257374693bf714c2cb8f6a311d31cc17ec12.pdf|title=The Role of Unput, Interaction and Output in the Development of Oral Fluency|last=Zhang|first=Shumei|date=December 2009|website=English Language Teaching|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202053320/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d3d3/257374693bf714c2cb8f6a311d31cc17ec12.pdf|archive-date=2017-12-02|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradis (2006)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; study on childhood language acquisition and building fluency examines how first and second language acquisition patterns are generally similar including vocabulary and morphosyntax.  Phonology of first language is usually apparent in SLA and initial L1 influence can be lifelong, even for child L2 learners.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Children can acquire a second language simultaneously (learn L1 and L2 at the same time) or sequentially (learn L1 first and then L2).  In the end, they develop fluency in both with one dominant language which is spoken largely by the community they live in.

According to one source, there are five stages of SLA and developing fluency:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McREL International|title=McREL - The Five Stages of Second Language Acquisition|date=2014-08-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNDNNW6LgWM|accessdate=2017-12-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509173500/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNDNNW6LgWM|archivedate=2018-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2018}}

# Advanced fluency.

====Second-language acquisition in adults====

The process of learning a second language or "L2," among older learners differs from younger learners because of their [[working memory]]. Working memory, also connected to fluency because it deals with automatic responses, is vital to language acquisition. This happens when information is stored and manipulated temporarily. During working memory, words are filtered, processed, and rehearsed, and information is stored while focusing on the next piece of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mackey | first1 = A. | last2 = Sachs | first2 = Rebecca | year = 2012 | title = Older Learners in SLA Research: A First Look at Working Memory, Feedback, and L2 Development | url = | journal = Language Learning | volume = 62 | issue = 3| page = 724 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2011.00649.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These false starts, pauses or repetitions found in fluency assessments, can also be found within one's working memory as part of communication.

Those with education at or below a high school level are least likely to take language classes. It has also been found that women and young immigrants are more likely to take language classes.&lt;ref&gt;Adamuti-Trache’ (2012). Language Acquisition Among Adult Immigrants in Canada: The Effect of Premigration Language. Adult Education Quarterly, 63(2), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Further, highly educated immigrants who are searching for skilled jobs – which require interpersonal and intercultural skills that are difficult to learn – are the most affected by lower fluency in the L2.

==Speech-language pathology==
Fluency is a [[speech language pathology]] term that means the smoothness or flow with which sounds, syllables, words and phrases are joined together when speaking quickly.&lt;ref name=harrell&gt;{{cite web

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18077">{{Wiktionary|Hazop}}
A '''hazard and operability study''' (HAZOP) is a structured and systematic examination of a complex planned or existing process or operation in order to identify and evaluate problems that may represent risks to personnel or equipment. The intention of performing a HAZOP is to review the design to pick up design and engineering issues that may otherwise not have been found. The technique is based on breaking the overall complex design of the process into a number of simpler sections called 'nodes' which are then individually reviewed. It is carried out by a suitably experienced multi-disciplinary team (HAZOP) during a series of meetings.  The HAZOP technique is qualitative, and aims to stimulate the imagination of participants to identify potential hazards and operability problems. Structure and direction are given to the review process by applying standardised guide-word prompts to the review of each node. The relevant international standard &lt;ref name=IEC /&gt; calls for team members to display 'intuition and good judgement' and for the meetings to be held in 'a climate of positive thinking and frank discussion'.

The HAZOP technique was initially developed in the 1960s to analyze major chemical process systems but has since been extended to other areas, including mining operations and other types of process systems and other complex systems such as [[nuclear power plant]] operation and software development. It is also used as the basis for reviewing Batch processes and operating procedures.

==Method==

The method is applied to complex 'processes' for which sufficient design information is available, and not likely to change significantly. This range of data should be explicitly identified and taken as the ‘design intent’ basis for the HAZOP study.  For example, a prudent designer will have allowed for foreseeable variations within the process creating a larger design envelope than just the basic requirements and the HAZOP will be looking at ways in which this might not be sufficient.

For processes plant, the nodes are chosen so that for each a meaningful ''design intent''  can be specified and they are commonly indicated on [[piping and instrumentation diagram]] (P&amp;IDs)  and [[process flow diagram]] (PFD). The extent of each node should be appropriate to the complexity of the system and the magnitude of the hazards it might pose. However, it will also need to balance between "too large and complex" (fewer nodes, but the team members may not be able to consider issues within the whole node at once) and "too small and simple" (many trivial and repetitive nodes, each of which has to be reviewed independently and documented).

For each node in turn the HAZOP team uses a list of standardised guide-words and process parameters to identify potential ''Deviations'' from the design intent. For each deviation, the team identifies feasible ''Causes'' and likely ''Consequences'' then decides (with confirmation by subsequent risk analysis where necessary) whether the existing safeguards are sufficient, or whether an ''Action'' to install an additional safeguard is necessary to reduce the risks to an acceptable level.

The degree of preparation for the HAZOP is critical to the overall success of the review - 'frozen' design information provided to the team members with time for them to familiarise themselves with the process, an adequate schedule allowed for the performance of the HAZOP, provision of the best team members for their role. Those scheduling a HAZOP should take into account  the review scope, the number of nodes to be reviewed, the provision of completed design drawings and documentation and the need to maintain team performance over an extended time-frame. The team members may also need to perform some of their normal tasks during this period and the HAZOP team members can tend to lose focus unless adequate time is allowed for them to refresh their mental capabilities.

The team meetings should be managed by an independent, trained HAZOP Facilitator who is responsible for the overall quality of the review, partnered with a dedicated Scribe to minute the meetings. "The success of the HAZOP study strongly depends on the alertness and concentration of the team members and it is therefore important that the sessions are of limited duration and that there are appropriate intervals between sessions. How these requirements are achieved is ultimately the responsibility of the study leader." &lt;ref name="IEC" /&gt;

For a medium-sized chemical plant where the total number of items to be considered is 1200 (items of equipment and pipes or other transfers between them) about 40 such meetings would be needed.&lt;ref name="Swann"&gt;Swann, C. D., &amp; Preston, M. L., (1995) ''Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries'', vol 8, no 6, pp349-353 "Twenty-five years of HAZOPs"&lt;/ref&gt;  Various software programs are now available to assist in meetings.

===Guide words and parameters===
In order to identify deviations, the team applies (systematically, in order {{efn| If an individual team member spots a problem before the appropriate guideword is reached it may be possible to maintain rigid adherence to order; if most of the team wants to take the discussion out of order no great harm is done if they do, provided the Study Leader ensures that the secretary is not becoming too confused, and that all guidewords are (eventually) adequately considered}}) a set of '''Guide Words''' to each node in the process.  To prompt discussion, or to ensure completeness, it may also be helpful to explicitly consider appropriate '''parameters''' which apply to the design intent.  These are general words such as Flow, Temperature, Pressure, Composition. The current standard&lt;ref name=IEC&gt;British Standard BS: IEC61882:2002 ''Hazard and operability studies (HAZOP studies)- Application Guide'' [[British Standards Institution]]. "This British Standard reproduces verbatim IEC 61882:2001 and implements it as the UK national standard."&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Guide words should be chosen which are appropriate to the study and neither too specific (limiting ideas and discussion) nor  too general (allowing loss of focus). A fairly standard set of Guide Words (given ''as an example'' in Table 3 of &lt;ref name=IEC /&gt;) is as follows:

{| border="1" cellpadding="1" class="wikitable" style="width:50%"
|-
!width="30%"|Guide Word

|AFTER

|}

(The last five guide words are applicable to batch or sequential operations.)  Where a guide word is meaningfully applicable to a parameter e.g. NO FLOW, MORE TEMPERATURE, their combination should be recorded as a credible potential deviation (from the design intent) that requires review.

HAZOP-type studies may also be carried out by considering applicable guide words and identifying elements to which they are applicable&lt;ref name=IEC /&gt; or by considering  the parameters associated with plant elements and systematically applying guide words to them; although this last approach is not mentioned in the relevant standard, its examples of output include a study (B3) recorded in this way.&lt;ref name=IEC /&gt;   The following table gives an overview of commonly used guide word - parameter pairs and common interpretations of them.

Once the causes and effects of any potential hazards have been established, the system being studied can then be modified to improve its safety.  The modified design should then be subject to another HAZOP, to ensure that no new problems have been added.  {{efn|ie the modifications (and their possible effect on other plant items) should undergo re-HAZOP }}

The ''technique'' can also be applied where design information is not fully available and doing so may be useful in eliminating alternative designs, before too much time is invested in them. However, where a design is required to have a HAZOP performed to meet legislative or regulatory requirements, such an 'early' meeting cannot be considered to comply with this requirement.

"The term HAZOP has been often associated, in a generic sense, with some other hazard identification technique.  The use of the term with such techniques is considered to be inappropriate and is  excluded from this document."&lt;ref name="IEC" /&gt;

==Team==
A HAZOP study is a team effort.  The team should be as small as possible consistent with their having relevant skills and experience  {{efn| and affiliation "Where a system has been designed by a contractor, the HAZOP team should contain personnel from both the contractor and the client." &lt;ref name=IEC/&gt; }} A minimum team size of 4&lt;ref name=IEC/&gt;-5 &lt;ref name=Nolan&gt;Nolan, D.P. (1994) ''Application of HAZOP and What-If Safety Reviews to the Petroleum, Petrochemical and Chemical Industries''. William Andrew Publishing/Noyes. {{ISBN|978-0-8155-1353-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is recommended. In a large process there will be many HAZOP meetings and the individuals within the team may change as different specialists are required and deputies are required for the various roles.  As many as 20 individuals may be involved&lt;ref name=Kletz1983/&gt; but is recommended that the team should not exceed 7&lt;ref name=IEC/&gt;-8&lt;ref name=Nolan/&gt; at any time (a larger team will make slower progress adding considerably to the costs). Each team member should have a definite role as follows &lt;ref name=IEC/&gt; Note that duplication of roles  (e.g. Client, Contractor &amp; Project Management representatives) should be avoided:

In earlier publications it was suggested that the Study Leader could also be the Recorder&lt;ref name=Kletz1983&gt;Kletz, T. A., (1983) ''HAZOP &amp; HAZAN Notes on the Identification and Assessment of Hazards'' IChemE Rugby&lt;/ref&gt; but separate roles are now generally recommended.

The use of computers and projector screens can enhance the recording of meeting minutes (the team can see what is minuted and ensure that it is accurate), the display of P&amp;IDs for the team to review, the provision of supplemental documented information to the team and the logging of non-HAZOP issues that may arise during the review, e.g. drawing/document corrections and clarifications. Specialist software is now available from several suppliers to support the recording of meeting minutes and tracking the completion of recommended actions.

==History==
Although a number of companies were addressing this issue, the technique is generally considered to have originated in the Heavy Organic Chemicals Division of [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]], which was then a major British and international chemical company.  The history has been described by [[Trevor Kletz]]&lt;ref name=Kletz1983/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kletzbiog&gt;Kletz, T., (2000) ''By Accident - a life preventing them in industry'' PVF Publications {{ISBN|0-9538440-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was the company's safety advisor from 1968 to 1982, from which the following is abstracted.

In 1963 a team of 3 people met for 3 days a week for 4 months to study the design of a new [[phenol]] plant.  They started with a technique called ''critical examination'' which asked for alternatives, but changed this to look for '''deviations'''.  The method was further refined within the company, under the name ''operability studies'', and became the third stage of its [[hazard analysis]] procedure (the first two being done at the conceptual and specification stages) when the first detailed design was produced.

In 1974 a one-week safety course including this procedure was offered by the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]] (IChemE) at [[Teesside Polytechnic]].  Coming shortly after the [[Flixborough disaster]], the course was fully booked, as were ones in the next few years.  In the same year the first paper in the open literature was also published.&lt;ref&gt;Lawley, H. G.,(1974) ''Chemical Engineering Progress'', vol 70, no 4 page 45 "Operability studies and hazard analysis" [[AIChE]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1977 the [[Chemical Industries Association]] published a guide.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical Industries Association (1977) ''A Guide to Hazard and Operability Studies''&lt;/ref&gt;  Up to this time the term '''HAZOP''' had not been used in formal publications.  The first to do this was Kletz in 1983, with what were essentially the course notes (revised and updated) from the IChemE courses.&lt;ref name=Kletz1983/&gt;  By this time, hazard and operability studies had become an expected part of [[chemical engineering]] degree courses in the UK.&lt;ref name=Kletz1983/&gt;

The '''health effects of chocolate''' are the possible positive and negative effects on health of eating [[chocolate]].

Unconstrained consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity, increases the risk of [[obesity]]. Raw chocolate is high in [[cocoa butter]], a fat removed during chocolate refining, then added back in varying proportions during  manufacturing. Manufacturers may add other fats, [[sugar]]s, and [[powdered milk]] as well.

Although considerable research has been conducted to evaluate the potential health benefits of consuming chocolate, there are insufficient [[clinical research|studies]] to confirm any effect and no medical or regulatory authority has approved any health claim.

==History==

''[[Theobroma cacao]]'', the cacao tree, produces seeds containing [[flavanol]]s. The seeds have been used to make beverages for some 2000 years in [[Aztec]], [[Olmec]], and [[Maya civilization]]s in central and south America. The drinks were ascribed a wide variety of curative and stimulant properties, unsupported by experimental evidence. In the 19th century, chocolate as a solid was invented, and milk and sugar were added to create milk chocolate, high in fat and sugar. Doubtful research, sometimes funded by the chocolate industry, has at times made suggestions of possible health benefits for these products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Nic|title=The dark truth about chocolate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/25/chocolate-the-dark-truth-is-it-good-for-you-health-wellbeing-blood-pressure-flavanols|accessdate=25 March 2018|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Acne===
Overall evidence is insufficient to determine the relationship between chocolate consumption and [[acne]].&lt;ref name="bhate2013"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23210645|year=2013|author1=Bhate|first1=K|title=Epidemiology of acne vulgaris|journal=British Journal of Dermatology|volume=168|issue=3|pages=474–85|last2=Williams|first2=H.

===Addiction===
Food, including chocolate, is not typically viewed as [[addiction|addictive]].&lt;ref name=Rogers2000&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rogers |first1=Peter J |last2=Smit |first2=Hendrik J |title=Food Craving and Food 'Addiction' |journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=3–14 |year=2000 |pmid=10837838 |doi=10.1016/s0091-3057(00)00197-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people, however, may want or crave chocolate,&lt;ref name=Rogers2000/&gt; leading to a self-described term, [[chocoholic]].&lt;ref name=Rogers2000/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/the-chocoholics-survival-guide|title=The Chocoholic's Survival Guide|last=Skarnulis|first=Leanna|work=webmd.com|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex===
It has been claimed that chocolate is an [[aphrodisiac]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=G|last2=Parker|first2=I|last3=Brotchie|first3=H|title=Mood state effects of chocolate|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|date=June 2006|volume=92|issue=2–3|pages=149–59|pmid=16546266|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2006.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are no rigorous studies to prove this effect. There is no clear evidence that stimulants like [[Phenethylamine|phenylethylamine]] found in chocolate increase PEA in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chocolatemonthclub.com/chocolate-history|title=History of Chocolate - Chocolate History Timeline {{!}} The Gourmet Chocolate of the Month Club|work=The Gourmet Chocolate of the Month Club|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart and blood vessels===
Reviews support a short-term effect of lowering blood pressure by consuming cocoa products, but there is no evidence of long-term cardiovascular health benefit.&lt;ref name="milliron"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milliron|first1=Tara|last2=Kelsberg|first2=Gary|last3=St Anna|first3=Leilani|year=2010|title=Clinical inquiries. Does chocolate have cardiovascular benefits?|url=http://www.mdedge.com/jfponline/article/63920/cardiology/does-chocolate-have-cardiovascular-benefits|journal=The Journal of Family Practice|volume=59|issue=6|pages=351–2|pmid=20544068|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ried|first1=Karin|last2=Stocks|first2=Nigel P|last3=Fakler|first3=Peter|date=April 2017|title=Effect of cocoa on blood pressure|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=81|issue=9|pages=1121–6|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008893.pub3|pmid=2843988|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While daily consumption of cocoa flavanols (minimum dose of 200&amp;nbsp;mg) appears to benefit [[platelet]] and vascular function,&lt;ref name="arranz"/&gt; there is no good evidence to support an effect on [[heart attack]]s or [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref name="arranz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arranz|first1=S|last2=Valderas-Martinez|first2=P|last3=Chiva-Blanch|first3=G|last4=Casas|first4=R|last5=Urpi-Sarda|first5=M|last6=Lamuela-Raventos|first6=RM|last7=Estruch|first7=R|title=Cardioprotective effects of cocoa: clinical evidence from randomized clinical intervention trials in humans|journal=Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research|date=June 2013|volume=57|issue=6|pages=936–47|pmid=23650217|doi=10.1002/mnfr.201200595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sudano&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sudano I, Flammer AJ, Roas S, etal |title=Cocoa, blood pressure, and vascular function |journal=Curr.

===Stimulant===
Chocolate contains [[caffeine]] and [[theobromine]], both mild [[stimulant]]s.&lt;ref name=Franco2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Franco |first1=Rafael |last2=Oñatibia-Astibia |first2=Ainhoa |last3=Martínez-Pinilla |first3=Eva |title=Health Benefits of Methylxanthines in Cacao and Chocolate |journal=Nutrients |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=4159–73 |year=2013 |pmid=24145871 |pmc=3820066 |doi=10.3390/nu5104159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weight gain===
The effect of chocolate on [[body weight]] is unclear. A concern is that excessive consumption of chocolate may promote high [[calorie]] intake and weight gain, a risk factor for many diseases, including cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name=Lat2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Latif|first1=R|title=Chocolate/cocoa and human health: a review.|journal=The Netherlands Journal of Medicine|date=March 2013|volume=71|issue=2|pages=63–8|pmid=23462053}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, consuming large quantities of dark chocolate in an attempt to protect against cardiovascular disease is likely to add excessive calories and induce weight gain.&lt;ref name=Lat2013/&gt;

==Lead content==
Although research suggests that even low levels of [[lead]] in the body may be harmful to children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Merrill, J.C. |author2=Morton, J.J.P. |author3=Soileau, S.D. |title= Principles and Methods of Toxicology |edition=5th |chapter=Metals |editor= Hayes, A.W. |year= 2007 |publisher= CRC Press |isbn= 978-0-8493-3778-9 |ref = CITEREFMerrill07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Casarett and Doull's Toxicology: The Basic Science of Poisons |edition=7th |chapter= Toxic effects of metals |editor1=Casarett, LJ |editor2=Klaassen, CD |editor3=Doull, J |year= 2007 |publisher= McGraw-Hill Professional |isbn= 978-0-07-147051-3|ref= CITEREFCasarett07}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is unlikely that chocolate consumption in small amounts causes [[lead poisoning]]. Some studies have shown that lead may bind to cocoa shells and contamination may occur during the manufacturing process.&lt;ref name=Rankin&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rankin|first=CW|last2=Nriagu |first2=JO |last3=Aggarwal |first3=JK |last4=Arowolo |first4=TA |last5=Adebayo |first5=K |last6=Flegal |first6=AR |title=Lead contamination in cocoa and cocoa products: isotopic evidence of global contamination |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=113 |issue=10 |pages=1344–1348 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16203244 |pmc=1281277 |doi=10.1289/ehp.8009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed the mean lead level in milk chocolate candy bars was 0.027&amp;nbsp;µg lead per gram of candy;&lt;ref name=Rankin/&gt; another study found that some chocolate purchased at U.S. [[supermarket]]s contained up to 0.965&amp;nbsp; µg per gram, close to the international (voluntary) standard limit for lead in cocoa powder or beans, which is 1&amp;nbsp;µg of lead per gram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heneman |first1=Karrie |last2=Zidenberg-Cherr |first2=Sheri |title=Is lead toxicity still a risk to U.S. children? |journal=California Agriculture |volume=60 |issue=4 |year=2006 |pages=180–4 |doi=10.3733/ca.v060n04p180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the U.S. FDA lowered by one-fifth the amount of lead permissible in candy, but compliance is only voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Lorraine Heller |title=FDA issues new guidance on lead in candy |publisher=FoodNavigator.com |date=29 November 2006 |url=http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/news/ng.asp?id=72399-lead-candy |accessdate=15 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies concluded that "children, who are big consumers of chocolates, may be at risk of exceeding the daily limit of lead; whereas one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit. Moreover chocolate may not be the only source of lead in their nutrition"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yanus |first1=Rinat Levi |last2=Sela |first2=Hagit |last3=Borojovich |first3=Eitan J.C. |last4=Zakon |first4=Yevgeni |last5=Saphier |first5=Magal |last6=Nikolski |first6=Andrey |last7=Gutflais |first7=Efi |last8=Lorber |first8=Avraham |last9=Karpas |first9=Zeev |title=Trace elements in cocoa solids and chocolate: An ICPMS study |journal=Talanta |volume=119 |issue= |pages=1–4 |year=2014 |pmid=24401377 |doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2013.10.048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "chocolate might be a significant source of Cd and Pb ingestion, particularly for children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Villa |first1=Javier E.

==Other animals==

{{Main|Theobromine poisoning}}
In sufficient amounts, the theobromine found in chocolate is [[toxic]] to animals such as cats, dogs, horses, parrots, and small rodents because they are unable to [[metabolize|metabolise]] the chemical effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Smit HJ |year=2011 |title=Theobromine and the pharmacology of cocoa |journal=Handb Exp Pharmacol |volume=200 |issue= 200|pages=201–34 |publisher= |doi= 10.1007/978-3-642-13443-2_7|pmid=20859797 |pmc= |url= |&lt;!-- accessdate= 4 July 2012 --&gt;|series=Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology |isbn=978-3-642-13442-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If animals are fed chocolate, the theobromine may remain in the circulation for up to 20&amp;nbsp;hours, possibly causing [[epileptic seizure]]s, [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[internal bleeding]], and eventually death. Medical treatment performed by a [[veterinarian]] involves inducing [[vomiting]] within two hours of ingestion and administration of [[benzodiazepine]]s or [[barbiturate]]s for seizures, [[antiarrhythmic agents|antiarrhythmics]] for [[cardiac arrhythmia|heart arrhythmias]], and [[forced diuresis|fluid diuresis]].

A typical {{convert|20|kg|lb|adj=on}} dog will normally experience great intestinal distress after eating less than {{convert|240|g|oz}} of dark chocolate, but will not necessarily experience [[bradycardia]] or [[tachycardia]] unless it eats at least a half a kilogram (1.1&amp;nbsp;lb) of milk chocolate. Dark chocolate has 2 to 5 times more theobromine and thus is more dangerous to dogs. According to the [[Merck Veterinary Manual]], approximately 1.3&amp;nbsp; grams of baker's chocolate per kilogram of a dog's body weight (0.02&amp;nbsp; oz/lb) is sufficient to cause symptoms of toxicity. For example, a typical {{convert|25|g|oz|adj=on}} baker's chocolate bar would be enough to bring about symptoms in a {{convert|20|kg|lb|adj=on}} dog. Of course, [[baking chocolate]] is rarely consumed directly due to its unpleasant taste, but other dark chocolates' canine toxicities may be extrapolated based on this figure. Given access, dogs frequently consume chocolate at toxic levels because they like the taste of chocolate products and are capable of finding and eating quantities much larger than typical human servings. There are reports that [[mulch]] made from cacao bean shells is dangerous to dogs and livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drolet |first1=R |last2=Arendt |first2=TD |last3=Stowe |first3=CM |title=Cacao bean shell poisoning in a dog |journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association |volume=185 |issue=8 |pages=902 |year=1984 |pmid=6501051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blakemore |first1=F |last2=Shearer |first2=GD |title=The poisoning of livestock by cacao products |journal=Veterinary Record |year=1943 |volume=55 |issue=15 |pages=165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science''''' is a 1994 book by [[biologist]] [[Paul R. Gross]] and [[mathematician]] [[Norman Levitt]].

==Summary==
Levitt states he is a leftist trying to save the "academic left" from itself by exposing misuses and abuses of science to advance political goals.

==Reception and influence==
The book inspired the 1996 [[Sokal affair|Sokal hoax]], in which [[Alan Sokal]] published a bogus paper to a [[postmodernist]] journal that did not [[Peer review|peer-review]] submissions.&lt;ref name="postmodernism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/824-postmodernism-disrobed |date=2007-04-01 |author=Dawkins, Richard |title=Postmodernism Disrobed |accessdate=2010-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120082759/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/824-postmodernism-disrobed |archivedate=2011-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sokal stated in an interview that while he was initially skeptical about ''Higher Superstition'', he concluded after reading the works Gross and Levit criticized that they were describing them fairly in "about 80 percent of the cases".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Anatomy-of-a-Hoax/238728?key=bB4GOexLsAk2KfnFOkgPCI0O5azbXR52m3YJxfcw-igptJkoKi_rn3RCDgSQfq6pc3g5NWVSMTIzSXBPNlRyc3YyVnBuczlCYV82MUNMWXdMY2gxYnNKdEN4NA|title=Bait and Switch: How the physicist Alan Sokal hoodwinked a group of humanists and why, 20 years later, it still matters.|first=Jennifer |last=Ruark |date=1 January 2017 |accessdate=7 January 2017 |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''insider threat''' is a malicious threat to an organization that comes from people within the organization, such as employees, former employees, contractors or business associates, who have inside information concerning the organization's security practices, data and computer systems. The threat may involve fraud, the theft of confidential or commercially valuable information, the theft of intellectual property, or the sabotage of computer systems.

== Overview ==
Insiders may have accounts giving them legitimate access to computer systems, with this access originally having been given to them to serve in the performance of their duties; these permissions could be abused to harm the organization. Insiders are often familiar with the organization's data and intellectual property as well as the methods that are in place to protect them. This makes it easier for the insider to circumvent any security controls of which they are aware. Physical proximity to data means that the insider does not need to hack into the organizational network through the outer perimeter by traversing firewalls; rather they are in the building already, often with direct access to the organization's internal network. Insider threats are harder to defend against than attacks from outsiders, since the insider already has legitimate access to the organization's information and assets.&lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/counterintelligence/the-insider-threat |title=FBI Counterintelligence: The Insider Threat. An introduction to detecting and deterring an insider spy |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210135443/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/counterintelligence/the-insider-threat |archivedate=2014-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An insider may attempt to steal property or information for personal gain, or to benefit another organization or country.&lt;ref name = "FBI" /&gt; The threat to the organization could also be through malicious software left running on its computer systems by former employees, a so-called [[Logic bomb]].

==Research centers==
Insider threat is an active area of research in academia and government.

The [[CERT Coordination Center]] at [[Carnegie-Mellon University]] maintains the CERT Insider Threat Center, which includes a database of more than 850 cases of insider threats, including instances of fraud, theft and sabotage; the database is used for research and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cert.org/insider_threat/ |title=The CERT Insider Threat Center |publisher=Cert.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; CERT's Insider Threat Team also maintains an informational blog to help organizations and businesses defend themselves against insider crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cert.org/blogs/insider_threat/|title=Insider Threat Blog|publisher=CERT|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research findings ==

IBAC is designed to prevent the insider threat as opposed to the current access control systems that are designed to prevent the outsider threat. IBAC is a risk-based access control that assesses risk of access based on the detected intent and the motivation level towards executing that intent. IBAC takes advantage of the robustness of P300-based Concealed Information Test to detect an intent of access and uses the brain signals to detect the motivation level. The access control system has been used on 30 participants with 100% detected intentions of access and all mal-intent users being rejected access before they commit their mal-intended action.

The '''ecological restoration of islands''', or '''island restoration''', is the application of the principles of [[ecological restoration]] to [[island]]s and island groups. Islands, due to their isolation, are home to many of the world's [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, as well as important breeding grounds for [[seabird]]s and some [[marine mammal]]s. Their ecosystems are also very vulnerable to human [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] and particularly to [[introduced species]], due to their small size. Island groups such as [[New Zealand]] and [[Hawaii]] have undergone substantial [[extinction]]s and losses of [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Since the 1950s several organisations and government agencies around the world have worked to restore islands to their original states; New Zealand has used them to hold natural populations of species that would otherwise be unable to survive in the wild. The principal components of island restoration are the removal of introduced species and the reintroduction of native species.

==Islands, endemism and extinction==
Isolated islands have been known to have greater levels of endemism since the 1970s when the theory of [[Island biogeography]], formulated by  [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E.O. Wilson]] was developed. This higher occurrence of endemism is because isolation limits immigration of new species to the island, allowing new species to evolve separately from others on the mainland. For example, 71% of [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|New Zealand]]'s bird species (prior to human arrival) were endemic. As well as displaying greater levels of endemism, island species have characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to human disturbance.

Many island species evolved on small islands, or even restricted habitats on small islands. Small populations are vulnerable to even modest hunting, and restricted habitats are vulnerable to loss or modification of said habitat. More importantly, island species are often ecologically naive, that is they have not evolved alongside a predator, or have lost appropriate behavioural responses to [[predator]]s. This often resulted in flightlessness, or unusual levels of [[island tameness|tameness]]. This made many species susceptible to hunting (it is thought, for example, that [[moa]]s were hunted to extinction in a few short generations) and to predation by introduced species. Some, such as the [[dodo]], are thought to have become extinct because of the pressure of both humans and introduced animals. One estimate of birds in the [[Pacific]] islands puts the extinctions at 2000 species. Between 40 and 50% of the bird species of New Zealand have become extinct since 200 AD.

[[Image:Takahe and chick.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Takahe]] have bred after translocation to restored islands, like these on [[Kapiti Island]].]]
The field of island restoration is usually credited with having been started in New Zealand in the 1960s, but other smaller projects, such as the restoration of [[Nonsuch Island]] in [[Bermuda]] (which began in 1962) have been going on for almost as long. Nevertheless, the program undertaken by the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation|Department of Conservation]] (DOC) is one of the largest in the world. It began on [[Cuvier Island]], where ecologists removed stock, [[goat]]s, [[feral cats]] and finally, in 1993, [[Pacific rat]]s. The success of the project resulted in similar projects around New Zealand. The advantages to the DOC were considerable; in addition to protecting species endemic to smaller islands, like the [[magenta petrel]], islands near the mainland, once restored, could act as habitat for species of birds that were unable to survive on the mainland. Species like the [[takahe]], where the remaining wild population was at considerable risk from feral cats and dogs, could be moved to these islands to safeguard the species.

===Eradication of introduced alien species===
One important aspect of island restoration is the removal of [[invasive species|invasive alien species]]. Since these species are most often the reason that native fauna and flora is threatened, their removal is essential to the restoration project. From 1673 until 2009, 786 successful invasive vertebrate eradication have been recorded and in the last few decades the frequency of eradications and the size of islands from which invasive vertebrates have been eradicated has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Islands Invasive Vertebrate Eradication Database: A tool to improve and facilitate restoration of island ecosystems.|url=http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/croll/pdf/Keitt_2011.pdf|publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islands are particularly suitable for restoration as once cleared of an introduced species they can be kept cleared of these species by virtue of being an island. Species removal is intensive and expensive, and methods used must be carefully chosen as to not create too much impact on non-target species. Feral cats, goats and three species of rats are among the most damaging species introduced to islands (Moors &amp; Atkinson 1984). The differences in size, lifestyle and behaviour preclude the use of the same techniques for all of them, but with many species a range of techniques needs to be used in order to ensure success. Larger animals, such as goats and pigs, can be effectively hunted; in the case of [[Round Island (Mauritius)|Round Island]], in [[Mauritius]], all the goats were eliminated by a single marksman. On larger islands ecologists use a [[Judas goat]], where a radio collared goat is released into the wild. This goat is then followed and groups it joins are removed. To remove cats a combination of techniques is needed: hunting, trapping and poisoning. Cats are more difficult to hunt than goats and pigs, requiring the use of experienced hunters and night hunting.

Trapping is ineffective for rats, given their sheer numbers, and the only method that works is [[poison]]ing, which can be delivered into the field by broadcasting (by hand or from the air) or by the maintenance of bait stations. This method has been employed around the world, in the [[Falkland Islands]], in the tropical Pacific, and off New Zealand, where over 40 islands have been cleared. This method is not without problems, especially if the rats share the island with other, native species of rodent that might take the bait as well, as has happened on [[Anacapa Island]] in the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] and Rat Island ([[Hawadax Island|Hawadax]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seabirdrestoration.org/pdf/RatIslandReview.pdf|title=THE RAT ISLAND RAT ERADICATION PROJECT: A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF NONTARGET MORTALITY.

In the Pacific poison intended for rats was taken by land [[crab]]s instead; the crabs were not affected by the poison but frustrated attempts to clear the rats.

The removal of invasive [[weed]]s is, in most cases, more difficult than removing animal species. One such eradication was that of [[sandbur]], ''Cencrus echinatus'', an introduced [[grass]] on [[Laysan]]. The grass, introduced to Laysan around 1961, had taken over 30% of the island by 1991, displaced the native [[bunchgrass]], and reduced the breeding habitat of two endemic threatened species, the [[Laysan duck]] and [[Laysan finch]], as well as those of several [[seabird]]s.  The removal took ten years, with controlled spraying for the first year, then individual removal of plants, then, when few plants were being found, sifting of the sands around plants to remove seeds. The cost of the eradication program was $150,000/year.

====Strategies====

There are three strategies to reduce the numbers of the introduced animals in order to lighten the problems caused by them: exclusion, control, and eradication.
Exclusion is removal of introduced species in limited areas and focused on a local impact.
Control has a meaning of mitigation by reducing the numbers of introduced species down to ecologically and economically less harmful level. Since it is not complete wiping out strategy, this has to be taken constantly and repeatedly. This strategy is said to be feasible but less cost effective due to its incompleteness.
Eradication is the complete removal of all the individuals of the population, down to the last potentially reproducing individual, or the reduction of their population density below sustainable levels&lt;ref&gt;Myers, J. H., Simberloff, D., Kuris, A.  M. &amp; Carey, J. R. (2000). Eradication revisited : dealing with exotic species. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 15, 316–320.&lt;/ref&gt; ( J. H. Myerset al., 2000). For islands, it is usually the best strategy as it gives permanent effects, which potentially means most cost effective. However, it is still logistically and economically high cost. Also, this strategy is sometimes hard to accomplish depending on the environment of island and the alien species.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Courchamp, F., Chapuis, J., and Pascal, M. (2003). Mammal invaders on islands: impact, control and control impact. Cambridge Philosophical Society. 78, 347-383.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods====

Fencing is used for excluding the alien mammals. This method intends to limit the area for the mammals before control or eradication.
Shooting is often used for large animals to control them. This method has meanings of gaining food supply and recreation. It requires accessibility in the field and experience for the hunters. Also, to maintain the effect, it requires good amount of manpower for long time, so it can be costly.
Trapping is designed for medium-sized mammals which are hard to shoot at.  This method is usually only for reduction not eradication. The advantage of this method is that it can be selective since it is possible to exclude or reduce the possibility of trapping native animals. However, trapping requires limited area to cover and limited population to capture.

Poisoning is very effective for small species. However, there are some disadvantages of this method. It is possible that untargeted animals take the poison. It is also necessary to consider the secondary poisoning that other animals are affected by poisoned species. This method can be costly if the area to cover is large.&lt;ref name=tny20141223&gt;
{{cite news |last1=Kolbert|first1=Elizabeth |title=The Big Kill : New Zealand's crusade to rid itself of mammals |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/22/big-kill |accessdate=23 December 2014 |work=The New Yorker |date=23 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathogen Introduction (parasitism) is one of the biological methods to eradicate alien species. It is very effective for limited species, but the viruses and bacteria need to be specified clearly for use.&lt;ref name=tny20141223/&gt;

Predator introduction is another biological method to eradicate the introduced species. It is less costly and environmentally clean, but it can cause greater problems, because it is possible that the introduced predator targets the native animals instead of alien species and its existence and its parasites can be new problems.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Competitor introduction is also a biological method to eradicate introduced carnivores. It can be very effective with good amount of information. In the end, the competitor has to be removed as well.
Virus vectored immune-contraception is one of the newest method that is to infect introduced animals with genetically engineered viruses. This method is considered environmentally clean, low cost, selective, and ethical. However, it is not fully operational and the effect comes slowly.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Restoration of former habitat===
In many cases the removal of introduced species is sufficient to allow a return to a pre-disturbance state, but generally active management, often in the form of replanting native flora and reintroduction of extirpated fauna is needed to achieve restoration goals. Planting of native species helps to replenish species that were either grazed or out competed. Species of animal can be translocated either from existing populations, or from captive bred populations. These reintroductions need to be carefully managed, particularly in the case of [[endangered species]], where the potential benefits need to be weighed against the possibility of failure. Not all translocations succeed, and it may be necessary to help the reintroduced animals along with supplementary feeding or other kinds of management.

One other important aspect of restoration is prevention, that is, keeping invasive species from returning to a cleared island. This can be achieved by restricting access to the island in question (reducing possible instances of invasion) to more stringent quarantine methods. For example, in order to prevent invasive weeds from returning to Laysan, people working on the island must bring entirely new clothes to the island, which must be frozen prior to arrival.

==Opposition to island restoration==
Prior to the initial efforts to remove rats from New Zealand's offshore islands there was a great deal of skepticism as to the feasibility of island restoration amongst ecologists and conservation workers. However, as the techniques have improved and larger islands have been restored, most of the initial criticisms from within the field have been dropped, in particular as the costs of eradication are often much lower than continuous pest control. Outside of the field of conservation there has been some opposition from other interested groups, particularly from the [[animal rights]] movement, which contends that the [[animal welfare|welfare]] of the pests in question is not adequately addressed in island restoration plans. Because a broad spectrum of pest removal techniques needs to be used, including leg traps, animal rights campaigners accuse ecologists of cruelty, and indifference to non-targeted species that also take bait or are trapped, and suggest that more humane methods such as capture and [[Animal sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] be used instead (something those working in island restoration contend would be too expensive, and potentially ineffective as in [[Kangaroo Island#Conservation|Kangaroo Island]] [[koala]]s.). Some also defend the rights of the introduced species to exist as well.  Others, including scientists affiliated with the animal rights movement, accept that when the choice is between the future of a species and a population of pests, the future of a species must take priority (with the caveat that the extermination is conducted as humanely as possible). Opposition to island restoration has not led to the abandonment of many projects but has delayed several, particularly through court action. Groups sometimes adopt different approaches; opponents of [[hedgehog]] removal in the [[Outer Hebrides]] offered bounties for live hedgehogs removed from the islands and relocated in their natural habitat. Invasive plants can also generate strong feelings. The removal of ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' trees from [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]] in [[San Francisco Bay]] faced considerable opposition.

==Island restoration projects==
Island restoration has been attempted in many countries since the 1960s, and has met with varying degrees of success. The following examples highlight some of the factors that influence projects.

[[Île Ronde, Mauritius|Round Island]] (Île Ronde in French) is a tropical island 22.5 kilometres north of [[Mauritius]], with an area of 1.69 square kilometres and a maximum elevation of 280 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org/application/index.php?tpid=30&amp;tcid=82|title=Welcome to the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation (MWF) - In The Field - Mauritius - Round Island|last=Foundation|first=Mauritian Wildlife|website=www.mauritian-wildlife.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other [[Mascarene Islands|Mascarene]] islands and islets, Round Island remained relatively pristine until goats and rabbits were introduced in the 19th century (goats were introduced between 1846 and 1868, whilst rabbits were present in large numbers before 1810).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/216936090|title=Lost land of the dodo : an ecological history of Mauritius, Réunion &amp; Rodrigues|last=S.)|first=Cheke, A. S. (Anthony|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|others=Hume, Julian P. (Julian Pender)|isbn=9780300141863|location=New Haven|oclc=216936090}}&lt;/ref&gt; These herbivores, along with other factors, such as sporadic logging and frequent cyclones, led to the eventual dwindling of the island's forests and dependent fauna. In turn, this led to soil erosion by wind and rain, impeding forest regeneration, acting as a [[Positive feedback|positive feedback mechanism]] that caused rapid deforestation of the island. In 1957, however, Round Island was officially made a nature reserve, and in 1979 and 1986 was rid of goats (shooting) and rabbits (poisoning), respectively, after several unsuccessful attempts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Since removal of the introduced herbivores, the Round Island plant community has recovered dramatically. This is especially stark for three of the endemic tree species, ''Latania loddigesii'', ''Pandanus vandermeerschii'' and ''Hyophorbe lagenicaulis'', which constituted a large portion of the Round Island forest historically. This has led to six reptile species (five of which were [[critically endangered]]) recovering in tandem with the plant community; these are the skinks ''Leiolopisma telfaririi'' and ''Scelotes bojerii'', the geckos ''Phelsuma guentheri'', ''P. ornata'' and ''Nactus serpensinsula'', and the snake C''asarea dussumerii.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1994-01-01|title=Changes in the vegetation and reptile populations on Round Island, Mauritius, following eradication of rabbits|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320794900043|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=67|issue=1|pages=21–28|doi=10.1016/0006-3207(94)90004-3|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Round Island restoration program represents one of the longest-running projects of its kind in the world, since its conservation status was confirmed in 1957. Much of the current conservation work on Round Island is conducted by the [[Mauritian Wildlife Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org/application/index.php?tpid=1&amp;tcid=1|title=Welcome to the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation (MWF) - Home|last=Foundation|first=Mauritian Wildlife|website=www.mauritian-wildlife.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.durrell.org/wildlife/|title=Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust {{!}} Home|website=Durrell|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revolves around maintaining soil levels, reforestation of the island, and eradication of remaining invasive plants and invertebrates. 

===Aleutian Islands===
[[Image:Fox with auklet.jpg|200px|thumb|Arctic fox with [[least auklet]].]]
The [[Aleutian Islands]], prior to the 18th century, lacked any terrestrial predators, but from the mid-18th century [[Arctic fox]]es were introduced to act as a source for the [[fur trade]], a practice that continued into the early 20th century. This introduction decimated the birds of the chain, particularly [[seabird]]s like the [[whiskered auklet]]. The reduction in seabirds, in turn, had effects on the [[ecology]] of the islands, as many of the plants were dependent on the guano from nesting birds acting as a fertilizer. In the early 1950s managers of the Aleutian Islands Reservation became aware of the damage, and an eradication program began. Since then over 80 islands have been cleared of non-native foxes (only six islands remain) and bird populations have rebounded. Whiskered auklets, which numbered 25,000 in 1974, had increased to 116,000 in 2003.

===Campbell Island===
[[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]] is a sub [[Antarctic]] island 700&amp;nbsp;km south of New Zealand that became infested with [[Norway rat|rats]] in the 19th century. Several endemic birds, including the [[Campbell teal]] and [[Campbell snipe]], only survived on small rocky islets just off the island, and the populations were perilously low. Several teals were taken into captivity for [[ex-situ conservation]], but once they had bred in captivity there was no-where else to return them to until the island was cleared of rats. The DOC's plan to remove rats from the island was one of the most ambitious attempted, as the island was so remote, the rat populations had the highest density of rats anywhere in the world, the weather treacherous and, at 113&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it was the largest island at that point where eradication had been attempted. The poison had to be dropped in the winter, to minimize disturbance to nesting seabirds and reduce the chance of [[bird strike]] for the pilots. After several experiments, the eradication began in 2001. In 2003 trackers with dogs were unable to find any rats. Soon after the island was cleared it was possible to return the teals to the island. [[Snipe]] have self-reintroduced to the island and have begun breeding.

=== South Georgia ===
Rats, brought to [[South Georgia Island]] as stowaways on sealing and whaling ships in the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgisland.gs/index.php/%28e%29Eradication_Of_Rodents?useskin=env|title=Eradication of Rodents|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands|access-date=2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150803043220/http://www.sgisland.gs/index.php/(e)Eradication_Of_Rodents?useskin=env|archivedate=2015-08-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have caused much damage to native wildlife, destroying tens of millions of ground-nesting birds’ eggs and chicks.

'''Jupiter mass''', also called '''Jovian mass''', is the [[units of mass|unit of mass]] equal to the total mass of the planet [[Jupiter]]. This value may refer to the mass of the [[planet]] alone, or the mass of the entire Jovian system to include the [[moons of Jupiter]]. Jupiter is by far the most [[giant planet|massive planet]] in the [[Solar System]]. It is approximately 2.5 times more massive than all of the other planets in the Solar System combined.&lt;ref name="Universe Today"&gt;{{cite web |last=Coffey |first=Jerry |title=Mass of Jupiter |url=https://www.universetoday.com/15141/mass-of-jupiter/ |publisher=[[Universe Today]] |date=18 June 2008 |access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jupiter mass is a common unit of [[mass]] in [[astronomy]] that is used to indicate the masses of other similarly-sized objects, including the [[outer planet]]s and [[extrasolar planet]]s. It may also be used to describe the masses of [[brown dwarf]]s, as this unit provides a convenient scale for comparison.

==Current best estimates==
The current best known value for the mass of Jupiter can be expressed as {{val|1898130|u=[[Orders of magnitude (mass)|yottagrams]]}}:
:&lt;math&gt;M_J=(1.89813\;\pm\;0.00019)\times10^{27}\;\mathrm{kg}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="JPL Planets"/&gt;
which is about 1000 times less massive than the sun (about {{solar mass|0.1%}}):
:&lt;math&gt;M_J=\frac{1}{1047.348644\;\pm\;0.000017}\;M_{Sun}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="CBE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Numerical Standards for Fundamental Astronomy|url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/NSFA/NSFA_cbe.html#MSMJ2009|website=maia.usno.navy.mil|publisher=IAU Working Group|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in scientific notation,
:&lt;math&gt;M_J = 954.7919(15)\times10^{-6}\;M_{Sun} &lt;/math&gt;.
Compared to the mass of Earth, Jupiter is 318 times more massive.
:&lt;math&gt;M_J = 317.82838\;M_\oplus &lt;/math&gt;.

==Context and implications==
Jupiter's mass is 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined—this is so massive that its [[barycenter]] with the [[Sun]] lies beyond the [[Photosphere|Sun's surface]] at 1.068&amp;nbsp;[[solar radius|solar radii]] from the Sun's center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacDougal |first1=Douglas W. |title=Newton's Gravity |date=November 6, 2012 |publisher=Springer New York |isbn=9781461454434 |pages=193–211 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-5444-1_10 |accessdate=July 28, 2016 |language=en |chapter=A Binary System Close to Home: How the Moon and Earth Orbit Each Other |quote=the barycenter is 743,000 km from the center of the sun. The Sun's radius is 696,000 km, so it is 47,000 km above the surface.|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-5444-1_10 |series=Undergraduate Lecture Notes in Physics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the mass of Jupiter is so large compared to the other objects in the solar system, the effects of its gravity must be included when calculating satellite trajectories and the precise orbits of other bodies in the solar system, including Earth's moon and even Pluto.

Theoretical models indicate that if Jupiter had much more mass than it does at present, its atmosphere would collapse, and the planet would shrink.&lt;ref name=Seager2007&gt;{{cite journal

== Gravitational constant==
The mass of Jupiter is derived from the measured value called the [[standard gravitational parameter|Jovian mass parameter]], which is denoted with ''GM&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''. The mass of Jupiter is calculated by dividing ''GM&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' by the constant ''[[gravitational constant|G]]''. For celestial bodies such as Jupiter, Earth and the Sun, the value of the ''GM'' product is known to many [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] more precisely than either factor independently. The limited precision available for ''G'' limits the uncertainty of the derived mass. For this reason, astronomers often prefer to refer to the gravitational parameter, rather than the explicit mass. The ''GM'' products are used when computing the ratio of Jupiter mass relative to other objects.

In 2015, the [[International Astronomical Union]] defined the ''nominal Jovian mass parameter'' to remain constant regardless of subsequent improvements in measurement precision of {{Jupiter mass}}. This  constant is defined as exactly:
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{GM})^\mathrm N_\mathrm J&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|1.2668653|e=17|u=m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}
If the explicit mass of Jupiter is needed in SI units, it can be calculated in terms of the [[Gravitational constant]], ''G'' by dividing ''GM'' by ''G''.&lt;ref name = "IAU XXIX"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1510.07674|last1=Mamajek|first1=E.

==Mass composition==

Lotion Play isolates lotion specifically as a lubricating medium - setting it apart in the Wet-and-Messy genre, as other common WAM mediums do not have such specific popularity as Lotion Play.  {{nihongo|'''Lotion Play'''|ローションプレイ|rōshon purei}}, also known as gookkake, gluekkake, is a popular [[sexual fetish|fetish]], form of [[pornography in Japan|Japanese erotica]] and [[prostitution in Japan|prostitution]] request involving the use of copious amounts of [[personal lubricant|lubricant]], which in the [[Japanese language]] is referred to by the Old-French word "lotion" (ローション in Japanese).Typically lotion play involves a participant rubbing lotion on another using their body,&lt;ref&gt;Talmadge, Eric.

In Japan (and other parts of the world), lotion is available in concentrated form (e.g.: liter/gallon) which can be added to hot water to produce the desired amount of lotion. A 1-gallon concentrate will typically yield 6-10 gallons of lotion (J-Lube Lotion Concentrate).  The main component in most lotion is [[Sodium polyacrylate|polyacrylate]].&lt;ref name=lotion&gt;[http://www.e-nls.com/pict2-2642-1111 Page for a lotion product, listing acrylate as the main component] (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar effect can be achieved by dissolving powdered [[methyl cellulose]] in water.

The '''multiple nuclei model''' is an economical model created by [[Chauncy Harris]] and [[Edward Ullman]] in the 1945 article "The Nature of Cities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Chauncy D.|last2=Ullman|first2=Edward L.|date=1945-01-01|title=The Nature of Cities|jstor=1026055|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=242|pages=7–17|doi=10.2307/1026055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Model==
The model describes the layout of a city, based on Chicago. It says that even though a city may have begun with a [[central business district]], or CBD, other smaller CBDs develop on the outskirts of the city near the more valuable housing areas to allow shorter commutes from the outskirts of the city. This creates nodes or nuclei in other parts of the city besides the CBD thus the name multiple nuclei model. Their aim was to produce a more realistic, if more complicated, model. Their main goals in this were to:
# Move away from the concentric zone model
# To better reflect the complex nature of urban areas, especially those of larger size

==Effects of multiple nuclei on Industry==
As multiple nuclei develop, transportation hubs such as airports are constructed which allow industries to be established with reduced transportation costs.
These transportation hubs have [[negative externalities]] such as noise pollution and lower land values, making land around the hub cheaper. Hotels are also constructed near airports because people who travel tend to want to stay near the source of travel. Housing develops in wedges and gets more expensive the farther it is from the CBD.&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Kelly. Kaplan AP Human Geography. 2009. 2009. 360-364. eBook. &lt;https://books.google.com/books?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for the model==

Harris and Ullman argued that cities do not grow a single nucleus but several separate nuclei. Each nucleus acts like a growth point.

The theory was formed based on the idea that people have greater movement due to increased car ownership. This increase of movement allows for the specialization of regional centers (e.g. heavy industry, business parks, retail areas). The model is suitable for the large, expanding cities. The number of nuclei around which the city expands depends upon situational as well as historical factors. Multiple nuclei develop because:
# Certain industrial activities require transportation facilities e.g. ports, railway stations, etc. to lower transportation costs.
# Various combinations of activities tend to be kept apart e.g. residential areas and airports, factories and parks, etc.
# Other activities are found together to their mutual advantage e.g. universities, bookstores and coffee shops, etc.
# Some facilities need to be set in specific areas in a city - for example the CBD requires convenient traffic systems, and many factories need an abundant source of resources.

==Assumptions for Model &lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Kelly. Kaplan AP Human Geography. 2009. 2009. 360-364. eBook. &lt;https://books.google.com/books?&lt;/ref&gt;==
#Land is not flat in all areas
#Even Distribution of Resources
#Even Distribution of people in Residential areas
#Even Transportation Costs

[[File:Institute of Fisheries.jpg|thumb|270px|Institute of Fisheries]]
The '''Ukrainian Institute of Fisheries of the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences''' is the country's main scientific institution that develops promising trends in the field of [[fisheries research]], coordinates and performs methodical management of scientific works in the field of [[aquaculture]] and fisheries.

== History ==
The Institute was established in 1930 from the Kyiv research fisheries station. Since that time, its name was changed from "Kyiv Research Institute of pond and lake and river fisheries" (1944), in "Ukrainian Research Institute of Fisheries" (URIF  – 1945) and "Ukrainian Scientific-Production Association Pisciculture and Fisheries" (UkrSPO for Pisciculture and Fisheries – 1986), and in 1992 it received its current name.

== Director ==
* Ihor Hrytsyniak, a doctor of agricultural sciences, professor, academician of the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine. 

Hrytsyniak is a member of the Director council on international cooperation of the Network of Scientific Aquaculture Centers in Eastern-Central Europe [http://www.agrowebcee.net/ru/nacee/home/ (NACEE)]. 

He is the editor-in-chief of scientific journal ''Fisheries Science of Ukraine'' published in Ukraine since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Ribogospodarsʹka nauka Ukraïni|url=http://fsu.ua/index.php/en/golovna|journal=Fisheries Science of Ukraine|language=en-gb|volume=|pages=|doi=10.15407/fsu|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Departments ==
The structure of the scientific units of the Institute of Fisheries

* Department of the study of reservoirs’ bioresources
* Department of fish selection
* Department of molecular-genetic studies with laboratory
* Department of ichthyopathology
* Department of fish feeds and feeding
* Department of international scientific and technical cooperation and intellectual property
* Department of pond aquaculture and hydrobiont ecology

* Laboratory of management in aquaculture
* Laboratory of bioindication and biochemical studies
* Laboratory of biotechnologies in aquaculture
* Laboratory of ecological studies
* Laboratory of hydrobiology and technology of the cultivation of valuable invertebrates
* Laboratory of salmonid culture and restoration of endangered fish species

* Sturgeon culture sector

The Institute network has four  organization: SE “Research farm “Nyvka” (Kiev), SE “Research farm of Lviv research station of the Institute of Fisheries” (Lviv region), Lviv research station (Lviv region) and Zakarpattya scientific-research station of salmonid culture and conservation of endangered fishes (Zakarpattia region).

== International cooperation ==
Institute scientists cooperate with more than thirty scientific institutions in 17 countries of Europe, Asia, and America. The main line is to solve the problems of aquatic bioresources and [[aquaculture]]. Internship programs for young scientists and training in new methods and techniques of research, selection, molecular-genetic and biochemical studies are developed with research institutions of Poland, Hungary, USA, Russian Federation and Belarus.

In 1997, the institute was the initiator for creating the International Council of scientific and technical cooperation in the field of aquatic bioresources of inland water bodies, which included 16 scientific institutions of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russian Federation, Poland, Hungary and Ukraine. The cooperation worked as bilateral and multilateral studies in the field of selection in aquaculture, conservation and restoration of valuable and endangered fish species, development of resource saving technologies of fish rearing, fisheries exploitation of reservoirs and cooling water bodies of energetic systems, fish feeding, prevention of fish diseases, etc.

In 2004, the International Council was transformed into the Network of Aquaculture Centers in Central-Eastern Europe (NACEE), the main mandate of which was to coordinate research and development works in the field of aquatic bioresources and aquaculture in this region. The Institute of Fisheries is an associate contractor on research topics including carp selection, sturgeon culture and conservation of aquatic bioresources. The Institute participates in the project “Technological platform of aquaculture development in Central and Eastern Europe with the possibility of further integration into a common European scientific space”. The Institute is also a member of the European Aquaculture Association, with which it cooperates in fishegries science.

== Scientific library ==
The Institute's library is a specialized scientific-subdivision, which carries out bibliographic and library support. The library has a specialized stock of scientific literature on [[aquaculture]], inland fisheries, [[ichthyology]], hydroecology, [[hydrobiology]], general biology, [[zoology]], [[hydrotechnics]] and aquaculture economy. The thorough use of the library stock is facilitated by the reference-bibliographic tool composed of catalogues and file-cabinets. The card variant has alphabetical and systematic catalogues, which include Institute reports, periodic journals, dissertations and dissertation abstracts, articles of the Institute employees (partially). The IRBIS electronic catalogue includes monographs, collections of scientific articles, articles from periodicals and other publications. The scientific library stock is composed of about 50 000 items and contains all types of print publications. The library provides information and library-bibliographic services to scientists, specialists, postgraduate students and students of higher education institutions. Reader services are performed through subscription, in the reading room and through an inter-library exchange system.

== ''Fisheries Science of Ukraine'' ==
The Institute was the founder and publisher of the quarterly scientific journal ''Fisheries Science of Ukraine''. The journal is included in the List of Specialized Publications of Ukraine, which can be used for publishing results of doctoral and candidate’s theses (biological and agricultural sciences). It was approved in 8 July 2009. and re-certified in 2014. Research papers are published in Ukrainian, Russian, or English. The Journal is open for free access by the Main Scientific Library of Ukraine – V.I. Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. The editorial board considers as a priority to include the Journal into international databases. It is represented in databases such as: Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), DOI (The Digital Object Identifier), [[Ulrich's Periodicals Directory]], Open Academic Journals Index (OAJI) eLIBRARY.RU, ROAD – каталог наукових ресурсів відкритого доступу, Google Scholar and [http://usj.org.ua/ «Українські Наукові Журнали»].

The '''Nautical Archaeology Society'''&lt;ref name="NASwebsite"&gt;[http://www.nasportsmouth.org.uk Nautical Archaeology Society website]&lt;/ref&gt; (NAS) is a charity registered in England and Wales&lt;ref name="charitycomm"&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ Charity Commission] The Nautical Archaeology Society is registered charity number 264209&lt;/ref&gt; and in Scotland&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscr.org.uk/CharityIndexDetails.aspx?id=SC040130 Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator register entry for NAS]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a [[company limited by guarantee]].&lt;ref name="cohouse"&gt;[http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/ Companies house] The Nautical Archaeology Society is registered at Companies House in England no. 1039270&lt;/ref&gt;

The charitable aims and object of the company are to further research in [[Nautical Archaeology]] and [[publish]] the results of such research and to advance education and training in the techniques pertaining to the study of Nautical Archaeology for the benefit of the public.&lt;ref name="charitycomm" /&gt;

Nautical archaeology is an [[Archaeological sub-disciplines|archaeological sub-discipline]] more generally known as [[maritime archaeology]], which encompasses the [[archaeology of shipwrecks]], [[underwater archaeology]] and archaeology of related features.

The society's logo is derived from an ancient engraving depicting nautical activity.

==History==

===Council for Nautical Archaeology===
The predecessor of the Nautical Archaeology Society was the '''Council for Nautical Archaeology''' (CNA).  This was formed in 1964
initially under the name the Committee for Nautical Archaeology:''"so as to ensure that the many discoveries being made by divers should not go by default through lack of contact with the appropriate learned bodies and to act as a channel of communication with the many interests that were growing up in this new field of research and exploration."''&lt;ref name="IJNA 5 2"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Council for Nautical Archaeology | journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = inside front cover | date = May 1976 | publisher=Academic Press, London | id = 0305-7445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural meeting of the CNA was held in [[Joan du Plat Taylor]]'s office at the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, at the University of London.  The Council membership included the [[Council for British Archaeology]], the [[British Museum]], the [[National Maritime Museum]], the Institute of Archaeology at London University, the [[Society for Nautical Research]] and the Society for Post Medieval Archaeology.  The [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] was also represented on the council.&lt;ref name="IJNA 5 2" /&gt;

It was the CNA that was responsible for establishing the ''International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'' and the Nautical Archaeology Trust in 1972, but it was also concerned with the promotion of legislation for the protection of nautical archaeological sites&lt;ref name="IJNA 5 2" /&gt; playing a key part in what became the [[Protection of Wrecks Act 1973]].

In 1984 the CNA was incorporated into the Council for British Archaeology as one of its research sub-committees&lt;ref name="IJNA 15 3"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Council for Nautical Archaeology | journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = inside front cover | date = August 1986 | publisher=Academic Press, London | id = 0305-7445 | doi=10.1111/j.1095-9270.1986.tb00574.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A brief history of the CBA | work=Council for British Archaeology website | publisher=Council for British Archaeology | url = http://www.britarch.ac.uk/cba/history.html | accessdate = 2007-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Nautical Archaeology Trust===
The body that eventually became the Nautical Archaeology Society was originally incorporated and registered as a charity in 1972 under the name (The) '''Nautical Archaeological Trust''' Limited.&lt;ref name="charitycomm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cohouse" /&gt;

The Trust was established by the Council for Nautical Archaeology as its limited liability charitable arm. As a corporate body the Trust gained the legal ability to enter into contracts and to hold assets.  The Trust's objects were
:"''the furtherance of research into nautical archaeology and the publication of the results of such research together with the advancement of training and education in the techniques pertaining to the study of nautical archaeology for the benefit of the public''"&lt;ref name="IJNA 5 2 Trsut"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Nautical Archaeology Trust | journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = inside front cover | date = May 1976 | publisher=Academic Press, London | id = 0305-7445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trust organised lectures, conferences and seminars, produced a newsletter and had a mechanism for associate membership for groups, associate individual members and subscribers.  Associate membership provided a discounted purchase price for the ''International Journal of Nautical Archaeology''.

In 1974, the then chairman of the CNA and of NAT, Professor [[W. F. Grimes]], proposed that what was needed was a membership society&lt;ref name="IJNA 10 4 NAS"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Flinder | first = Alex |author2=Margaret Rule | title = The Nautical Archaeology Society | journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 273 | date = November 1981 | publisher=Academic Press|location=London | id = 0305-7445 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-9270.1981.tb00040.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this took some years to establish. The CNA and the Trust eventually agreed the form of constitution of such a Society and the inaugural meeting took place in 1981. The intention of the Society was to act as a forum for the interchange of ideas and all of the associates and subscribers of the Trust were transferred to full membership the Society. The specific intention was to further cooperation between amateurs and professionals and its impact spread beyond the UK with a third of the new membership in its first year being from outside the UK.&lt;ref name="IJNA 10 4 Editorial"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Morrison | first = Ian | title = Editorial | journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 271–2 | date = November 1981 | publisher=Academic Press, London | id = 0305-7445 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-9270.1981.tb00039.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joan du Plat Taylor]] was the first president.

For a few years from 1981, the activities of the charity (the Trust) were separated from the interchange between the members (the Society) although both had identical aims, but the situation was resolved by a special meeting of the Trust held on 3 July 1986 at the Science Museum.&lt;ref name="IJNA 15 3 Editorial"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fenwick | first = Valerie | title = Editorial | journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 177 | date = August 1986 | publisher=Academic Press|location=London | id = 0305-7445 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-9270.1986.tb00572.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this meeting, the members of the Trust voted to change the name of the Trust to the Nautical Archaeology Society and to change the constitution (the articles of association) to reflect the change to a membership organisation.&lt;ref name="cohouse" /&gt;  The reconstituted organisation continued to have responsibility for producing the IJNA and a clause safeguarding the academic standards of the journal was added to the articles.  The renamed Trust thus subsumed the role of providing a forum for the interchange of ideas and the memberships of those who had participated in the Society (many of whom were in any case the original associates and subscribers of the Trust) transferred to membership of the incorporated body.

===The beginning of NAS training===
With the dual advantages of a participatory membership and its status as a registered charity, in 1986 the newly reconstituted Nautical Archaeology Society ran the first events in what later became its four-part training syllabus.

==NAS training and education==

===NAS training===
The society educates and trains professional and amateur [[archaeologist]]s and [[Professional diving|commercial]] and [[Recreational diving|recreational divers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.1283 English Heritage Protected wrecks website] – recommendation to use NAS training.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the NAS training syllabus is to develop awareness, respect for and understanding of the maritime cultural heritage and to develop capability in the maritime archaeological sector by training in relevant archaeological and underwater skills as well as to develop knowledge and understanding of the technology of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Marc-Andre Bernier, Underwater Archaeology Service, Parks Canada, [http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/2006/index.html "To Dig or not to Dig"] in ''Underwater Cultural Heritage at Risk: Managing Natural and Human Impacts'', ICOMOS, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

NAS Training is supported by [[Cadw]] and [[Historic Scotland]] to provide training opportunities in Wales and Scotland respectively. The development of the NAS training curriculum was supported by [[English Heritage]] and its predecessors from 1991 to 2004.

===NAS Training International===
The NAS Training syllabus has been adopted by the following organisations in other countries.

===NAS Conference===
The annual one-day NAS conference provides a forum for a wide range of presentations on nautical archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasportsmouth.org.uk/news/conference2008.php NAS Conference 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasportsmouth.org.uk/news/conference2008.php NAS Conference 2008 themed 'Encouraging Access']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasportsmouth.org.uk/news/conference2007.php NAS Conference 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasportsmouth.org.uk/news/conference2006.php NAS Conference 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;  At the event the annual Adopt-a-Wreck award is presented.  The Muckelroy award will be presented for the first time at the 2009 Conference, since administration of the award was transferred to the NAS.

==Publications==
===''International Journal of Nautical Archaeology''===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Underwater archaeology]] --&gt;
''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'' (''IJNA'') is published bi-annually (Print {{ISSN|1057-2414}}, online {{ISSN|1095-9270}}) for NAS by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com Blackwell Publishing Ltd.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a peer-reviewed academic journal but articles by amateur researchers that meet the journal's standards have been published.

''IJNA'' aims to cover all aspects of nautical archaeological research including the seas, ships, cargos, [[harbour]]s and sailors of the past. 

''IJNA'' was first published in 1972 under the founding editor [[Joan du Plat Taylor]]. Since 1980, ''IJNA'' has been edited by Ian Morrison, James Kirkman, Valerie Fenwick and Paula Martin. The current editor, Miranda Richardson, took over in 2012. Angela Croome held the position of reviews editor from the journal's foundation until 1916 when Paula Martin took over.

===NAS Monograph Series===
The first in the NAS monograph series is the report of the Sound of Mull Archaeological Project (SOMAP), which ran from 1994 to 2005.&lt;ref name=SOMAP&gt;''The Sound of Mull Archaeological Project (SOMAP) 1994–2005'', Philip Robertson, with contributions by Jane Maddocks and Steve Webster.

The NAS monograph series was edited by Gerald Grainge until 2016, who was replaced by Julian Whitewright.

===''NAS Handbook''===
The ''NAS Handbook'' provides an introduction to underwater archaeology.  The material in the handbook is consistent with the teaching of the NAS Training programme.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Bowens (ed.), ''Underwater Archaeology: The NAS Guide to Principles and Practice'', 2nd Edition 2009, Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-7591-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

===Joan du Plat Taylor Award===
{{main article|Joan du Plat Taylor}}
The Joan du Plat Taylor Award is a grant awarded annually by the Nautical Archaeology Society to support publication of nautical archaeological research. The grant was originally funded personally by [[Joan du Plat Taylor]], the founder editor of ''IJNA'' and the first president of the Nautical Archaeology Society.

=== Adopt-a-Wreck ===
The Adopt-a-wreck scheme, run by the Nautical Archaeology Society was set up as a joint initiative with the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/wreck_amnesty_final_report.pdf ''Final Report on the Wreck Amnesty''], Maritime and Coastguard Agency 2001, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; to encourage groups and individuals to take a close interest in a maritime site, and adopt a minimum level of stewardship, monitoring how the site changes over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dorsetforyou.com/index.jsp?articleid=30581 Adopted wrecks in Dorset.]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as [[shipwrecks]], adopted sites can include [[harbour]] works and buildings with [[nautical]] connections, [[coastal]] habitations, [[Hulk (ship)|hulks]] and other sea wrack of archaeological interest. The society maintains a register of all such adopted sites&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasportsmouth.org.uk/wreck/index.php Adopt-a-wreck index],&lt;/ref&gt; and since 2003 has provided an annual award to the person or group that has made the most significant contribution to maritime archaeology and research through the adoption process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Awards|url=http://www.nauticalarchaeologysociety.org/projects/award.php|publisher=Nautical Archaeology Society|accessdate=12 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902212625/http://www.nauticalarchaeologysociety.org/projects/award.php|archivedate=2 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A pilot for the Adopt-a-Wreck scheme was run on the East Indiaman ''[[Halsewell (East Indiaman)|Halsewell]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/annual_report_2002 Receiver of Wreck Annual Report for 2002], Maritime and Coastguard Agency, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keith Muckelroy Award===
This award is made in memory of [[Keith Muckelroy]] and until 2008 was awarded as part of the British Archaeological Awards.  In 2008 the administration of the award was transferred to the Nautical Archaeological Society, and the award will be presented at the 2009 conference.  It is awarded for the best published work covering maritime, nautical or underwater archaeology which best reflects the pioneering ideas and scholarly standards of Keith Muckelroy.

==Projects==

===The Gresham Ship===
In 2004 the Nautical Archaeological Society took custody of the remains of an Elizabethan wreck discovered in the Princes Channel of the [[Thames]] Estuary during dredging operations by the [[Port of London Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;Antony Firth, Wessex Archaeology, [http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/2006/index.html "Old Shipwrecks and New Dredging: An Elizabethan Ship in the Thames"] in ''Underwater Cultural Heritage at Risk: Managing Natural and Human Impacts'', ICOMOS, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The remains represented a navigation hazard, and as they had been disturbed and damaged by the dredging operations, preservation in situ was not an option.  The remains were investigated by Wessex Archaeology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/marine/thameswreck/index.html Wessex Archaeology's investigation of the wreck in Thames]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dendrochronology]] by Nigel Nayling of the University of Wales gave a construction date of soon after 1754, probably in [[East Anglia]].  The remains were transferred to [[Horsea Island]], an estuarine lake near [[Portsmouth]], where the brackish water should enable the timbers to stabilise while they are accessible to students for study and training purposes. The remains of the ship are being studied as part of a five-year project also involving the Port of London Authority, the [[Museum of London Docklands|Museum at Docklands]], the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology at University College London]], [[Gresham College]] and the [[University of Southern Denmark]].  The ship has been termed the "[[Gresham Ship]]" because one of the guns recovered had the initials and emblem of Sir Thomas Gresham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=45&amp;EventId=897 Gresham College lecture on Elizabethan ships]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thamesodyssey.org/index.html Thames Odyssey project site for Gresham Ship]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pla.co.uk/display_fixedpage.cfm/id/2678/site/environment Port of London website for Gresham Ship]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://maritimearchaeologyprogramdenmark.wordpress.com/tag/gresham-ship/ University of South Denmark Research on the Gresham Ship.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wreckmap Projects===
The Nautical Archaeology Society manages or participates in research projects with the aims of firstly furthering research and secondly enabling novice professionals and avocational archaeologists to have opportunities to get involved in archaeological research&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3HConsulting.com/ 3H Consulting website, the home of Site Recorder]: Examples of surveyed sites, guidance on 3D survey and free Site Reader tool&lt;/ref&gt; and hence develop individual experience and promote best practice in investigative techniques. Wreckmap projects focus on surveying and recording sites in a specific area. Projects have included the 'Sound of [[Isle of Mull|Mull]] Archaeological Project' (SOMAP), which ran from 1994 to 2005&lt;ref name=SOMAP/&gt; and the "SubMAP" project, which investigated the wreck of [[Resurgam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3hconsulting.com/SitesResurgam.htm Resurgam Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205040431/http://www.3hconsulting.com/SitesResurgam.htm |date=5 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wreckmap projects have also been conducted in [[Portland Harbour|Portland]], Dorset and Teesbay (near [[Hartlepool]]). 

Wreckmap Britain 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%26+heritage/archaeology/art29419 24 hour museum report on Wreckmap Britain 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; encouraged recreational divers to submit a recording form for a favourite [[Wreck diving|dive]] anywhere in [[UK|Britain]]. Wreckmap Britain 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dorsetcoast.com/index.jsp?articleid=354298 Dorset Coast Forum report on Wreckmap Britain 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched at the London International Dive Show (LIDS) on 1 April 2006 and has distributed 100,000 recording forms to recreational divers.  The results will be added to the Shipwreck Index.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shipwrecks.uk.com/ Shipwrecks UK], with context, thematic and detailed information on more than 45,000 shipwrecks in the seas surrounding Britain and Ireland, building on the Lloyds Register Shipwreck Index volumes.&lt;/ref&gt; WreckMap Britain is conducted in partnership with the [[Marine Conservation Society]] (SeaSearch) and sponsored by [[Crown Estate]], the [[British Sub-Aqua Club|BSAC]] Jubilee Trust and [[PADI]] through the [[Project AWARE]] Foundation.

===Forton Lake===
Forton Lake is a community based project to record the hulks of vessels abandoned at Forton Lake, [[Gosport]].  The field work and community training for the project was supported by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] from 2006 to 2007 and the final year of fieldwork in 2008 and publication is being supported by [[Crown Estate]].  The project is carried out jointly with the [[Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hwtma.org.uk/archaeological-projects/project-3/forton-lake/ Forton Lake Project.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diving Into history===
The Diving into History Project, supported by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], ran from 2006 to 2008 and included outreach activities to the public and support for Adopt-a-Wreck groups.  In addition community based projects were carried out, including an industrial and oral history project involving underwater survey of Stoney Cove and archive and oral history research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beehive.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/default.asp?WCI=SiteHome&amp;ID=11898&amp;PageID=80208 Beehive Community website on Stoney Cove Oral History project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/ebulletin/news/out-and-about/2000-2009/2006/12/nparticle.2006-12-19.2122468962 University of Leicester Stoney Cove Oral History project.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dig, Dive and Discover===
In 2006 a group of sea cadets were given the opportunity to become maritime archaeologists, learning to scuba dive, to research archives and to design web sites.  The project was supported by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] 'Young roots' programme and was carried out in conjunction with Hartlepool library and Hartlepool Diving Club.  An excavation of a wreck was carried out at Middleton Sands on Teesbay and the cadets built their own website documenting their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portcities.hartlepool.gov.uk/server.php?show=ConNarrative.156 Dig, Dive and Discover.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives==

===North East England Maritime Archaeology Research Archive===
The '''North East England Maritime Archaeology Research Archive''' (NEEMARA) was established in 2006 thanks to grant funding from [[English Heritage]] and from local councils.  The archive contains reference material on ships, shipbuilding and archaeological reports and is housed at the offices of [[Hartlepool]] Borough Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartlepool.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=965&amp;pageNumber=1 NEEMARA at Hartlepool Borough Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

===NAS Project and NAS Part Two Reports===
Projects directly run by NAS (including Wreckmap projects) have project reports that are submitted to the appropriate [[Sites and Monuments Record|Heritage Environment Record]](HER).  As part of NAS training, students submit a project report for part two of the NAS Certificate in Underwater and Foreshore Archaeology.  Where appropriate reports are submitted to the appropriate local HER.  NAS project reports and NAS Part two reports are also available to view at NAS offices in Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasportsmouth.org.uk/training/part2-guidance.php NAS Part Two reports.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Big Anchor Project===
The Big Anchor Project is an international project which is attempting to collect data on anchors to provide a research resource for the identification of anchors.  Following a pilot exercise by the South West Maritime History Society and Dorset County Council, a web site enables anyone to upload pghotographs and information about anchors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swmaritime.org.uk/pages.php?pid=80 SW Maritime History Society pilot for Big Anchor.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biganchorproject.com/ Big Anchor Project.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hartlepool Built===
The Hartlepool Built project is a project to gather data on ships built in Hartlepool and on the people who sailed them.  Designed as a web-based oral history type project, the project captures, and publishes on the web information on ships built in Hartlepool over the last 170 years, with photographs and other information from relatives of those whose lives were affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartlepoolbuilt.co.uk/ Hartlepool Built website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006072847/http://www.hartlepoolbuilt.co.uk/ |date=6 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/A-history-of-town-shipbuilding.5227729.jp ''Hartlepool Mail'' story about Hartlepool Built.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the publication ''Oriens christianus in quatuor patriarchatus digestus''|Michel Le Quien}}
'''''Oriens Christianus''''' is an [[academic journal]] established in 1901 by [[Otto Harrassowitz]] with [[Asian studies|Asian]] and [[oriental studies]] as the major focus.&lt;ref&gt;The original subtitle was "Römische Halbjahr Hefte für die Kunde of christlichen Easts ', which later became simply" Hefte für die Kunde of christlichen Easts'.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;It was founded January 25, 1876 to mark the hundredth anniversary of the birth of writer and Catholic historian Joseph Görres, in his hometown. There has been a Görres Institute in [[Rome]] since 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;It was edited by [[Carl Anton Baumstark|Anton Baumstark]] (1872-1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Reviews | author = S. P. Brock | journal = [[The Journal of Theological Studies]] | year = 1973 | volume = XXIV | issue = 1 | pages =237–238 | doi = 10.1093/jts/XXIV.1.237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[editors-in-chief]] are Hubert Kaufhold ([[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]) and Manfred Kropp ([[University of Mainz]]).


Its domain is the [[Christian East]] excluding [[Greek Orthodox|Greek]] and Slavic [[Christendom]] (covered by other reviews), that is to say the [[Middle East]] from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]] to [[Ethiopia]], Asian Christian communities and to [[India]] and [[China]]. According to the founder of the program, all elements of the spiritual and material culture of the Christian communities of the East can be addressed. The journal publishes background articles, minutes of reading, but also source-texts in the various languages of Eastern Christendom. Articles can be written in different languages.

The review was led until 1941 (with brief interruptions) by its founder Carl Anton Baumstark, who has published 140 feature articles and 145 book reviews accounts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6350">A '''pocket neighborhood''' is a type of planned community that consists of a grouping of smaller residences, often around a [[courtyard]] or common garden, designed to promote a close knit sense of [[community]] and neighborliness with an increased level of contact.&lt;ref name=Builder&gt;Home Builder Network. ''Builder'', September 2005. [http://www.hbrnetwork.com/articles/sales/pocket-change.aspx "Pocket Change"]. Retrieved on July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Considerations involved in planning and [[zoning]] pocket neighborhoods include reducing or segregating parking and roadways, the use of shared communal areas that promote social activities, and homes with smaller square footage built in close proximity to one another (high density). Features in the smaller homes are designed to maximize space and can use built in shelves and porch areas, encouraging time spent outside with a focal point around a [[Open space reserve|greenspace]] (instead of parking areas).&lt;ref name="good life" /&gt;

[[Environmentalism|Environmental considerations]] often play a role in the planning of pocket neighborhoods, and those advocating them promote their design as an alternative to the [[Urban sprawl|sprawl]], isolation, expense, and commuter and automobile focus of many larger homes in [[suburbia|suburban developments]].

== Origins ==
The term "pocket neighborhood" was coined by architect Ross Chapin.&lt;ref name="pocket_neighborhoods"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pocket neighborhoods (Open Library)|url = https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16113705W/Pocket_neighborhoods|website = openlibrary.org|accessdate = 2015-08-09|last = OpenLibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Chapin partnered with The Cottage Company founder Jim Soules to build the first contemporary pocket neighborhood, the Third Street Cottages, in the city of [[Langley, Washington|Langley]] on [[Whidbey Island]] in [[Puget Sound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/01/pocket-neighborhoods-suburbs-sustainable/864/ | title='Pocket Neighborhoods' For Sustainable Suburbs | publisher=The Atlantic Cities | date=Jan 3, 2012 | accessdate=June 30, 2012 | author=Benfield, Kaid}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Street Cottages, a collection of 8 modest {{convert|650|-|1600|sqft|m2|adj=on}} cottages,&lt;ref name="good life"&gt;Lisa Selin Davis The Good Life; pride of place April 2008 page 17-22 ''Cottage Living''&lt;/ref&gt; were developed to take advantage of Langley's cottage ordinance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mrsc.org/subjects/planning/cottagehousing.aspx | title=Langley Municipal Code Ch. 18.22.180 - Cottage Housing | publisher=The Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington | accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where zoning allowed for double density housing "if the homes were limited to 975 square feet".&lt;ref name="good life" /&gt;

Soules describes a pocket neighborhood as "a group of homes that face and relate to one another around a landscaped common area—the old [[bungalow court]] approach." Chapin also credits [[Radburn design housing]], architect Bernard Maybeck's Rose Walk in the [[Berkeley Hills]], and early 20th century cottage courts such as [[Seattle|Seattle's]] Pine Street Cottages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Are small cottages the next big thing in housing?|url = http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Are-small-cottages-the-next-big-thing-in-housing-1280757.php|accessdate = 2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; as influences on the pocket neighborhood plan.&lt;ref name="pocket_neighborhoods"/&gt; Pocket neighborhoods often adopt a model of cooperative ownership and shared community responsibilities similar to [[Cohousing|cohousing communities]].

Other projects include Conover Commons in [[Redmond, Washington]], Greenwood Avenue Cottages in [[Shoreline, Washington]], Danielson Grove in [[Kirkland, Washington]], Umatilla Hill in [[Port Townsend, Washington]] and Salish Pond in [[Gresham, Oregon]].&lt;ref name="good life" /&gt; The smaller homes are more affordable to maintain and keep up, and cooperation can be a benefit when it comes to watching children and pets.&lt;ref name="good life" /&gt;

[[File:PROUTlogo.gif|thumb|180px|Progressive Utilization Theory logo]]
'''Progressive Utilization Theory''' (Prout), also known by the acronym '''PROUT''', is a [[socioeconomic]] and political theory developed by philosopher and spiritual leader [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]].&lt;ref name="Crovetto2008" /&gt;{{r|"Crovetto2011"}} The theory is based on his holistic outlook of life.{{r|:7|:0}} It is a system of governance&lt;ref name="Skrbina" /&gt; that is inspired by [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] thought, as well as Sarkar's own ideas. It aims to be [[Economic progressivism|economically progressive]] and improve [[Social change|social development]].{{r|:7|p=1}} The theory is in line with Sarkar's [[Neohumanism|Neohumanist]] values which aim to provide "proper care" to every being on the planet, including  humans, animals and plants.{{r|:1}}

== History ==
By 1959, Sarkar had developed the ideas of Prout. In 1961, the theory was formally outlined in his book ''Ananda Sutram'', published under his spiritual name Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti.{{r|Irving}}

In 1968, Sarkar founded the organisation "Proutist Block of India" (PBI), to further the ideals of his theory through political and social action.{{r|fukui|p=357}} The PBI was soon superseded by "Proutist Universal" (PU), which primarily consists of five federations (students, intellectuals, farmers, labour, and youth).{{When|date=May 2018}} 

The theory has not achieved widespread implementation.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;{{When|date=May 2018}} Cooperative communities have been established by [[Ananda Marga]] in an attempt to provide ideal models for the society outlined in Prout.&lt;ref name=Ellwood/&gt;{{When|date=May 2018}}

==Theory==
=== Overview ===
Prout proposes an [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] system as an alternative to [[communism]] and [[capitalism]], taking ideas from both.&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt; Under the system [[Tangible property|material goods]] would be [[common ownership|common property]] and [[Distribution (economics)|distributed]] in a rational and equitable way to maximize the physical, mental, and spiritual development of all people.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Onwuka /&gt; The distribution intends to guarantee food, clothing, shelter, education, and medical care (what the theory regards as minimum requirements for humans).&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt;

Prout advocates a three-tiered approach to [[industrial organization]]. Key industries and [[public utilities]] would be [[nonprofit organization]]s. Decentralized industry run by [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] unions would provide people's minimum necessities. The majority of economic transactions would be through producers' and consumers' [[cooperative]]s.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; Incentives for people serving society would be funded via surpluses.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

At the political level, Prout rejects [[nationalism]]. Instead, there would be locally governed self-sufficient socioeconomic zones and a [[world government]].&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inayatullah/&gt; There would be a world [[constitution]] and a [[bill of rights]] for animals and plants, as well as humans.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

=== Law of social cycle and governance ===
{{main|Law of social cycle}}
Prout takes account of Sarkat's [[law of social cycle]]. It sees the [[social order]] as consisting of four [[Social class|classes of people]] that cyclically dominate society: ''shudras'' (workers), ''kshatriyas'' (warriors), ''vipras'' (intellectuals) and ''vaishyas'' (acquisitors).&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

However, Prout does not seek the abolition of these four classes, as it sees them as "... not merely as a power configuration, but as a way of knowing the world, as a paradigm, episteme or deep structure if you will."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It considers that any person can be worker, warrior, intellectual or acquisitive minded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prout in a Nutshell, volume 4|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, these different class or psychologies, are not seen as static or mutually exclusive. The theory sees them as evolving over an individual's lifetime.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

Prout see the four classes as connected to cyclic processes across time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; That when a class of people struggle and rise to power they cause a revolution in the physical and mental world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The theory then see the newly powerful class becoming corrupt.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; To prevent any social class from clinging to political power and exploiting the others, a "spiritual elite" sadvipras (etymologically sad – true, vipra – intellectual) would determine who will hold political leadership.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; Prout theorises that the first sadvipras would come from disgruntled middle-class intellectuals and warriors.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; 

Sadvipras would be organized into [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature|legislative]], and [[judiciary|judicial]] boards which would be governed by a Supreme Board.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; They would be responsible for the application of force necessary to change the order of dominance within the social order. It is envisioned that large amounts of force, akin to [[revolution]], may be necessary.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

=== Neohumanism ===
{{main|Neohumanism}}
The Prout theory is inline with Sarkar's Neohumanism philosophy. The philosophy is a reinterpretation of [[humanism]]{{r|bio|:0}} integrating the idea of unity of all life. In it all living beings belong to a universal family deserving equal care and respect.{{r|:1}}



=== The five fundamental principles ===
In 1962, Sarkar formally outlined Prout in sixteen [[aphorism]]s (see Chapter 5 of ''Ananda Sutram''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ananda Sutram|last=Anandamurti|first=Shrii Shrii|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1962|isbn=8172520271|location=Jamalpur|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The last five aphorisms (5:12-16) are commonly referred to as the five fundamental principles of Prout. These five principles are deemed to be fundamental because it would be difficult to get a clear understanding of Prout without comprehending the underlying concepts of these principles, the interrelationship of the principles, and their respective areas of application.

The five aphorisms from Ananda Sutram translate into English as follows:&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles for a Balanced Economy: An Introduction to the Progressive Utilization Theory|last=Bjonnes|first=Roar|publisher=PROUT Research institute|year=2012|isbn=9780985758509|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There should be no accumulation of wealth without the permission of society.
# There should be maximum utilization and rational distribution of the crude, subtle, and causal resources.
# There should be maximum utilization of the physical, mental, and spiritual potentialities of the individual and collective beings.
# There should be a well-balanced adjustment among the crude, subtle, and causal utilizations.
# Utilizations vary in accordance with time, space, and form; the utilizations should be progressive.
An initial glimpse of these five principles first appeared in Sarkar's earlier work, ''Idea and Ideology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Idea and Ideology|last=Anandamurtii|first=Shrii Shrii|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=9780985758509|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The market ===
As far as Prout's values and goals differ from those of [[capitalism]] and [[communism]],&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/jar/HOH/HOH-8.pdf|title=Panimatzalam’s Voice of Transformation: An Indigenous Mayan Writing Project for Youth Activism|last=Oppenheim|first=Matt|date=|website=North Arizona University|page=144|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT in Power|last=Inayatullah|first=Sohail|publisher=Proutist Bloc India|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so does its [[Economic system|economic structure]]. Following a close analysis of the two systems, Prout’s propounder argues that these philosophies are "anti-human“ in the sense that they encourage people to relentlessly pursue material attainment, like name, fame, etc. 

Another criticism of [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] and capitalism in general is the centralization of economic power in the hands of the rich leads to the exploitation of the masses and ultimately to the denegeration of society.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT in a Nutshell part 12|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prout claims that both capitalism and communism have been built on shaky foundations, and identifies weaknesses to a point where a new market system is required.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He heavily critiqued communism, indicating that one of the reasons the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s experiment with communism did not work, causing the eventual implosion of their political structure, is that the sovietic central planning committees ([[Gosplan]]) had too much economic decision and cohersion power in the federation (see [[Marxism–Leninism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centrosraffa.org/public/bb6ba675-6bef-4182-bb89-339ae1f7e792.pdf|title=An analysis of the Soviet economic growth from the 1950’s to the collapse of USSR|last=Serrano|first=Franklin|last2=Mazat|first2=Numa|date=|website=Centros Raffa|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/inactive/command.pdf|title=Are Command Economies Unstable? Why did the Soviet Economy Collapse?|last=Harrison|first=Mark|date=|website=University of Warwick|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Sarkar observed aspects of [[Economic planning|market planning]] that help to create and sustain a healthy economy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growing a new economy|last=Bjonnes|first=Roar|last2=Sevaergrah|first2=Caroline|publisher=Inner World Books|year=2016|isbn=9781881717539|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, Proutist thought considers that planning allows the market to protect its stakeholders from the meanderings of [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal economics]] where profit-motive speaks highest.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prout.org.au/books/Self-Reliant%20Regional%20Development.pdf|title=Self-Reliant Regional proutist development|last=Ghista|first=Dhanjoo|last2=Towsey|first2=Michael|date=|website=Prout.org|page=7|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he stresses that a planning committee at a national level should only outline the broader aspects of economic development, leaving the details to be resolved by planning bodies at a local level where problems are best understood and more easily dealt with.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proutinstitute.org/download/block-level-planning/|title=Block-level planning|last=Logan|first=Ronald|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[diseconomies of scale]]). Consequently, this kind of top-down planning will leave communities, enterprises and ultimately workers with a significant level of freedom to decide their own economic future (see [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized planning]]).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Prout also claims that the [[nationalization]] of enterprises is inefficient due to the larger costs and amount of bureaucracy necessary to keep state-controlled industries running.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Society part 1|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/12/economist-explains-1|title=Why nationalisation has fallen out of favour in Britain|last=|first=|date=|work=The economist|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there are some industries that should be nationalized, operating on a "no-profit, no-loss" principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prout in a Nutshell volume 4 part 21|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key industries vital for the prosperity of society (such as transportation, energy or hospitals), claims Sarkar, should be run by the immediate government as they are too large of operations to be run conveniently by private business men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Concerning wealth distribution among the population, Prout argues for an "optimal inequality" where the wage gap between the richer strata of society is substantially subsided.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Richard B. Freeman|Richard Freeman]], a Harvard economist, points out income inequality comes from the monopoly of power and other activities with "negative consequences" in terms of social development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/opinion/edsall-just-right-inequality.html|title=Just Right Inequality|last=Thomas|first=Edsall|date=2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless Prout is not in favour of total income equality, claiming that in a society where material motivation to work is absent, the willingness to strive for financial success and to thrive in the creative development of industry and society will be lost in its citizens. Therefore, Sarkar argues for the implementation of a policy allowing the most meritous in society to receive added perks for the added benefits they bring to society. It is thus theorized that the communist‘s motto of from [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]] cannot work in the real world. Prout proposes instead a minimum and maximum wage, roughly attributed according to the value the work of each person brings to society. We see examples of attempts in this direction in companies like [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon]] or [[Whole Foods Market|Whole Foods]].

Regarding neo-liberalism, Sarkar throws a new light to the concept of Adam Smith's [[invisible hand]], where individual producers acting self-interest benefit the community as a whole. Prout claims that, unchecked, societies economic elite will disrupt the just circulation of material wealth within society. The market will then require regulatory measures so as to create a functional economic system.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Economic democracy ===
In relation to democracy, Prout argues that political democracy is not enough to free society from exploitation and what it considers extreme income inequality.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.online.southcentral.edu/students/instructors/MFMyROSEarticle.pdf|title=Living Wage and Optimal Inequality in a Sarkarian Framework|last=Friedman|first=Mark|date=2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Roar Bjonnes]], a known Proutist, states, "Unless we have deeper structural change – what we refer to as economic-systems change – we will never be able to solve such global and systemic problems as the environmental and inequality crises. History has demonstrated that political democracy is not enough." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Prout, therefore, advocates an [[economic democracy]] where the decision-making power for the economic future of a community is given to its inhabitants. Economic democracy is not a new term, but Sarkar reinvents it by setting four requirements for what he considers a successful one.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proutist Economics: Discourses on Economic Liberation|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1992|isbn=9788172520038|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and foremost requirement is guaranteeing the minimum requirements of life to all members of society. Secondly, and following one of the five fundamental principles, Prout argues that there should be an increasing purchasing capacity for each individual, stating that local people will have to hold economic power over their socio-economic region.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Still, on this regard, Sarkar theorizes that, unlike [[capitalism]], where the production and distribution of goods are mainly decided by market competition, in a Proutistic society it should be based on necessity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The third requirement of economic democracy is the [[decentralization]] of power, giving the freedom to make economic decisions to its stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; That can be accomplished by adopting a worker-owned cooperative system &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Worker and Community: Response to Industrialization in a Nineteenth Century American City, Albany, New York, 1850-1884|last=Greenberg|first=Brian|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=978-0-88706-046-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the use of local resources (raw materials and other natural resources) for the development of the region and not merely for export.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In summary, Prout advocates a decentralized economy where self-sufficient economic zones are created and organized according to a set of predetermined conditions (see socio-economic units).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Prout claims this requirement does not express xenophobic feelings, it solely claims to be the realization that there should not be a constant outflow of local capital, where natural resources are explored by foreign investment companies that extract assets and money out of the community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Small Is Beautiful|last=Schumacher|first=E.F.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1973|isbn=978-0-06-091630-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a [[Neohumanism|Neohumanist]] perspective, all people are free to choose where they wish to live, as long as they merge their economic interests with the ones of the local people.

Prout rests upon the concept of a tiered economic structure in which the production and distribution of goods is performed according to three distinctive business models.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During his lifetime, he classifies and clarifies the need for these models which are; medium-scale worker-owned [[cooperative]]s, small-scale privately owned businesses and government-run large-scale key industries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sarkar justifies this economic structure by claiming that there are fundamental strengths and weaknesses embedded in each style of business which makes them more suitable for specific industries and scales of operation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cooperatives, he understood, are desirable for the majority of enterprises.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This claim has been given since that by working together and taking hold of the means of production, cooperative workers and consumers will be safeguarded against different forms of economic exploitation, offering no scope for intermediaries to interfere with their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A few problems solved part 9|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga publications|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, key industries vital to the development of the country and of strategic importance&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proutinstitute.org/download/prouts-3-tiered-economic-system/?wpdmdl=1652|title=PROUT’s Three-Tiered Enterprise System|last=Logan|first=Ronald|date=2015|website=PROUT institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as electrical utilities or the railway system), should be run by the immediate local government. He justified this idea by claiming that these industries are too complex and large scale to be run effectively by a cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discourses on PROUT|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Sarkar defends that small businesses can be privately owned and managed.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Enterprises with few employees such as family businesses are encouraged to be self-managed. Sarkarian thought sees that some people have economic dreams that are more individual in nature and hence not suitable to be constrained by collective interests.

In a Prout system there would be no privately owned corporations.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Socio-economic units ===
A socio-economic unit, or Samaj in [[Sanskrit]], is the Proutist materialization of the collective effort to create a strong and resilient local [[community]], built on strong feelings of [[solidarity]] and [[Self-concept|self-identity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are a few criteria that Sarkar outlined in order to build a working and cohesive socio-economic unit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In sum, a unit should have common social and economic conditions, geographical potentialities, cultural legacy and language.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Similar to [[Bioregionalism|bioregions]], their purpose is to facilitate cooperative development, moving towards a decentralized economy, where these units are economically independent and self-reliant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Self Reliant Regional Proutistic Development|last2=Towsey|first2=Michael|last1=Ghista|first1=Dhanjoo|publisher=Prout Research Institute|year=1991|url=http://www.prout.org.au/books/Self-Reliant%20Regional%20Development.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though still guided by national and federal guidelines and laws, they should prepare its own economic plan.

Aiming to achieve maximum efficiency in the utilization of local resources, they propose to make trade across borders more balanced and mutually beneficial.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In Prout these socio-economic units would also create the necessary balance in the world's trade in so much as independently run and self-reliant communities would not need the resources from more developed economic powers seeking to exploit them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;


=== Progress ===
From Prout's perspective, a progressive society cannot solely be measured by the wealth of a nation or it’s GDP levels. Prout recognizes the benefits of material progress, but deems them insufficient indicators of the development of human society.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT - A New Paradigm for Development|last=Logan|first=Ronald|publisher=Ananda Seva Publications|year=2005|isbn=1892345048|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that even though progress as its interpreted by society today has its advantages, there are negative side effects that, if unchecked, bring more harm than good. Ronald Logan, author of ''A new Paradigm of Development,'' reminds its readers that even though auto and air traffic enables us to travel at increasing speeds, bringing great convenience to travelers and commuters, it also brings air pollution, noise pollution, traffic congestion, accidental deaths, alienation from nature, etc.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Presented with this quasi-paradoxical situation, Prout offers a concept of progress as a society that transcends material and technological development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moving along the lines of the [[triple bottom line]] that analyzes the social, environmental and financial output of a given enterprise, Prout advocates a measure of progress that encompasses the qualities of what could be termed a "fourth bottom line",&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; characterized by the incorporation of a transcendental dimension of human life that focuses on the integrated development of the body, mind and spirit. This fourth bottom line will allow society in general and individuals in particular to develop an expanded sense of identity, allowing for a neohumanist will of inclusion, creating a society where material gains are not the [[summum bonum]] of life and allowing space to be created for people to work together in a symbiotic movement that primes for individual and collective welfare through social, cultural, as well as technological development.

Prout acknowledges that the well-being of individuals lies in the development of the collective, and that the collective depends on the development of individuals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Therefore, in order to understand how a progressive society is to be achieved, Sarkar tries to analyze what it means for a human being to grow and develop. He concludes that physical and psychic development render little progress for a human being as they are subject to deterioration and decay.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proutglobe.org/2011/11/what-is-progress/|title=What is Progress|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|date=|website=PROUT Globe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multifarious [[disease]]s that affect our body and mind, and even if we stay free of them, eventually time will turn all our physical and mental faculties of no use. Sarkar argues that the only aspect of human life that seems to be subject to no change over time is its transcendental nature, the "supra-emotional values" intrinsic to the human mind and which exacerbate human multilateral existence.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

"The deepest truths of life are an eternal fountain of inspiration. Spiritual, transpersonal development is a process of expanding one's consciousness to link with the Infinite, to reach a state of deep peace and happiness."&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proutglobe.org/2012/10/a-new-definition-of-social-progress|title=A new definition of social progress|last=|first=|date=|website=PROUT Globe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[Abraham Maslow|Maslownian]] perspective, Sarkar defends the need to meet physical and mental needs before being able to engage in a journey to find that transcendental nature of the world.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The five fundamental principles stem from this idea that society needs to provide for the basic necessities of all human beings so that they can engage in this journey of self-discovery and achieve true progress. Fundamentally, progress in society is the effort through which communities engage in the fulfillment of human needs, with the goal of achieving a transcendental existence. As a goal, transcendence will offer a fourth bottom line which ideally would propel human society into a more peaceful, inclusive and all-round more progressive existence.

==Criticism==
Prout is a relatively unknown theory.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  [[Johan Galtung]] claimed Prout is unlikely to make it into the western education system: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''"P. R. Sarkar was a great thinker and a great practitioner. I have chosen to honor him as a great macrohistorian, focusing on his theory of Social Cycles and their implications for world unity and peace… But, given the ethnocentrism of the USA and Europe, Sarkar will not easily make it into textbooks or courses about civilization"'' ''–'' Johan Galtung &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Economist [[Paul Erdman]], in the [[Los Angeles Times]] , described Prout as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"a strange mixture of voodoo historical theories and sound economic analysis"''&lt;ref name="Erdman" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ravi Batra]] was one of the first economists that used the ideas of Prout in his bestseller ''[[The Great Depression of 1990]]''. In time, the theory attracted attention of people like [[Johan Galtung]], founder of the UN Institute for Peace studies who claimed that ''"Sarkar’s theory is far superior to [[Adam Smith|Adam Smith’s]] or that of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]."'' &lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Some thinkers have proclaimed the pertinence that this theory has in the context of our modern world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Who|date=May 2018}} In the foreword of ''After Capitalism: Prout’s Vision for a New World'' political philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote, ''"Alternative visions are crucial at this moment in history. Prout’s cooperative model of economic democracy, based on cardinal human values and sharing the resources of the planet for the welfare of everyone, deserves our serious consideration."'' &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the same book historian [[Howard Zinn]] wrote, ''"After Capitalism is refreshingly original. It is spiritual and utopian while remaining grounded in reality. Its analysis is intelligent and its vision inspiring."'' &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[Leonardo Boff]], Brazilian theologian and writer, has summed up what he considers to be the importance of Prout: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"The exceptional importance of the Prout system resides in two fundamental points: its completeness and its viability. The entire system comes from a correct understanding of the human being, personal and collective, and authentic human development…" ''&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

According to a description by Terry Irving and [[Rowan Cahill]], Prout "envisages a decentralised, community-based world economy of self-sufficiency for the poor; economic democracy; small business; and limits on the accumulation of wealth."&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt; [[Sohail Inayatullah]] stated that the philosophy "attempts to balance the need for societies to create wealth and grow with the requirements for distribution."&lt;ref name=Inayatullah /&gt; [[David Skrbina]] characterized Prout as a "model of social development... which advocates a 'small is beautiful' approach to society."&lt;ref name=Skrbina /&gt;  Economics instructor Mark Friedman places Sarkar's economic thought in the tradition of Monsignor [[John A. Ryan]], [[E.F. Schumacher]] and [[Herman Daly]] in Sarkar's incorporation of spiritual values into economic goals.&lt;ref name=Friedman /&gt;

It has been characterized as a form of "progressive socialism"&lt;ref name=Ellwood /&gt; as well as a "socialist theory".&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt; 

Hans Despain noted, in [[Monthly Review]], that there are similarities between Prout and the theories of [[David Schweickart]], [[Gar Alperovitz]] and [[Richard D. Wolff]]. Particularly the focus on economic democracy and co-operatives.&lt;ref&gt;https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/its-the-system-stupid/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML)''' is a representation format, based on [[XML]], for the encoding and exchange of simulation descriptions on [[computational models]] of biological systems.&lt;ref name="sed-ml"/&gt; It is a free and open community development project.

SED-ML Level 1 Version 1&lt;ref name="Nature Precedings" /&gt; is the first version of SED-ML, allowing to describe time course simulation experiments.

== Structure ==

The SED-ML format is built of five major blocks:

* The Model entity is used to reference the models used in the simulation experiment and to define pre-processing procedures on these models before simulation. Models must be in standard representation formats (e.g., [[SBML]], [[CellML]], [[NeuroML]]). Examples for pre-processing are, e.g., changing the value of an observable, computing the change of a value using mathematics, or general changes on any XML element of the model representation.
* The Simulation entity contains all information about the simulation settings and the steps taken during simulation, e.g., the particular type of simulation and the algorithm used for the execution of the simulation. The simulation algorithm is specified with a [[KiSAO|Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology]] term.
* The Task entity applies one of the defined simulations with one of the referenced models at a time.
* The DataGenerator entity encodes post-processing procedures which need to be applied to the simulation result before output, e.g., normalisation of data.
* The Output entity specifies the simulation output, e.g., the particular plots to be shown.

More information on the SED-ML structure is available from the SED-ML home page&lt;ref name="sed-ml"/&gt; and the reference publication.&lt;ref name="BMC Systems Biology" /&gt;

== History ==

The idea of developing a standard format for simulation experiment encoding was born at the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] (EMBL-EBI). In 2007, Dagmar Waltemath and Nicolas Le Novère started to draft such a format during Dagmar's Marie-Curie funded internship in the Computational Neuroscience group at EMBL-EBI.&lt;ref name="compneur" /&gt;

The SED-ML project was first discussed publicly at the 12th SBML Forum Meeting in 2007, in Long Beach (US). The first version of SED-ML was then presented at the "Super-hackathon "standards and ontologies for Systems Biology"" in Okinawa in 2008. Back then, the language was called MIASE-ML (in accordance with the [[MIASE]] guidelines). In Okinawa, many researchers showed a high interest in the format, and discussions were vital. MIASE became the Minimum Information guideline for simulation experiments. MIASE-ML was renamed into "Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language" (SED-ML).

Level 1 Version 1 of SED-ML officially appeared in March 2011, but SED-ML was presented, discussed and further specified during several community meetings in the years in between, including the combined "CellML-SBGN-SBO-BioPAX-MIASE workshop" in 2009, or the "2010 SBML-BioModels.net Hackathon".

Since then SED-ML has been developed in collaboration with the communities forming the "computational modeling in biology network" [[COMBINE]]. Besides dedicated sessions at various meetings, the development of SED-ML benefits from community interactions on the SED-ML-discuss mailing list.&lt;ref name="discuss" /&gt;

== SED-ML Community ==

SED-ML is part of the [[COMBINE|COmputational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE)]]. Format development is coordinated by an editorial board elected by the community.&lt;ref name="editors" /&gt; Discussions take place at SED-ML-discuss.&lt;ref name="discuss" /&gt;

'''Scale analysis''' (or '''order-of-magnitude analysis''') is a powerful tool used in the [[mathematical sciences]] for the simplification of [[equation]]s with many terms. First the approximate magnitude of individual terms in the equations is determined. Then some negligibly small terms may be ignored.

==Example: vertical momentum in synoptic-scale meteorology==

Consider for example the [[Primitive equations|momentum equation]] of the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] in the vertical coordinate direction of the atmosphere

:&lt;math&gt;{{\partial w }\over{\partial t }} + u {\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}} + v {\frac{\partial w}{\partial y}} + w {\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}} - {\frac{u^2 + v^2}{R}}= - { { \frac{1}{\varrho}}{\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}}} - g +2{\Omega u \cos \varphi} + \nu \left({\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}}+{\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial y^2}}+{\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial z^2}}\right),\qquad(1)  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is [[Earth]] radius, &amp;Omega; is [[frequency]] of rotation of the Earth, ''g'' is [[gravitational acceleration]], &amp;phi; is  latitude, &amp;rho; is [[density]] of air and &amp;nu; is [[viscosity|kinematic viscosity]] of air (we can neglect turbulence in [[free atmosphere]]).

In [[synoptic scale]] we can expect horizontal velocities about ''U'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m.s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; and vertical about ''W'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m.s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Horizontal scale is ''L'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m and vertical scale is ''H'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m.  Typical time scale is ''T'' = ''L''/''U'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s.  Pressure differences in troposphere  are ''ΔP'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa and density of air &amp;rho; = 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Other physical properties are approximately:

:''R'' = 6.378 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m;

:&amp;Omega; = 7.292 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; rad&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1;&lt;/sup&gt;

:&amp;nu; = 1.46 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1;&lt;/sup&gt;

:''g'' = 9.81 m&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2.&lt;/sup&gt;

Estimates of the different terms in equation (1) can be made using their scales:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{{\partial w }\over{\partial t }} &amp;\sim \frac{W}{T} \\[1.2ex]
u {\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}} &amp;\sim U\frac{W}{L} &amp;\qquad
v {\frac{\partial w}{\partial y}} &amp;\sim U\frac{W}{L} &amp;\qquad
w {\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}} &amp;\sim W\frac{W}{H} \\[1.2ex]
{\frac{u^2}{R}} &amp;\sim \frac{U^2}{R} &amp;\qquad
{\frac{v^2}{R}} &amp;\sim \frac{U^2}{R} \\[1.2ex]
\frac{1}{\varrho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} &amp;\sim \frac{1}{\varrho}\frac{\Delta P}{H} &amp;\qquad
\Omega u \cos \varphi &amp;\sim \Omega U \\[1.2ex]
\nu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2} &amp;\sim \nu \frac{W}{L^2} &amp;\qquad
\nu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial y^2} &amp;\sim \nu \frac{W}{L^2} &amp;\qquad
\nu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial z^2} &amp;\sim \nu \frac{W}{H^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can introduce these scales and their values into equation (1):

:&lt;math&gt;
{\frac{10^{-2}}{10^5}}+10{\frac{10^{-2}}{10^6}}
+10{\frac{10^{-2}}{10^6}}
+10^{-2}{\frac{10^{-2}}{10^4}}
-{\frac{10^2+10^2}{10^6}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- extra blank line between lines of "displayed" TeX, for legibility --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
= - {{\frac{1}{1}} {\frac{10^4}{10^4}} } - 10 + 2 \times 10^{-4} \times 10 + 10^{-5} \left({\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{12}}} + {\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{12}}} + {\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{8}}}  \right).
\qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

We can see that all terms — except the first and second on the right-hand side — are negligibly small. Thus we can simplify the vertical momentum equation to the [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] equation:

:&lt;math&gt;{ { \frac{1}{\varrho}}{\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}}} = - g. \qquad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

==Rules of scale analysis==
Scale analysis is very useful and widely used tool for solving problems in the area of heat transfer and fluid mechanics, pressure-driven wall jet, separating flows behind backward-facing steps, jet diffusion flames, study of linear and non-linear dynamics. Scale analysis is recommended as the premier method for obtaining the most information per unit of intellectual effort, despite the fact that it is a precondition for good analysis in dimensionless form. The object of scale analysis is to use the basic principles of convective heat transfer to produce order-of-magnitude estimates for the quantities of interest. Scale analysis anticipates within a factor of order one when done properly, the expensive results produced by exact analyses. Scale analysis ruled as follows:

'''Rule1-''' First step in scale analysis is to define the domain of extent in which we apply scale analysis. Any scale analysis of a flow region that is not uniquely defined is not valid.

'''Rule2-''' One equation constitutes an equivalence between the scales of two dominant terms appearing in the equation. For example,

:&lt;math&gt; \rho c_P {{\partial T }\over{\partial t }} = k {\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

In the above example, the left-hand side could be of equal order of magnitude as the right-hand side.

'''Rule3-''' If in the sum of two terms given by

:&lt;math&gt; c = a+b  &lt;/math&gt;

the order of magnitude of one term is greater than order of magnitude of the other term

:&lt;math&gt; O(a) &gt; O(b)  &lt;/math&gt;

then the order of magnitude of the sum is dictated by the dominant term

:&lt;math&gt; O(c) = O(a)  &lt;/math&gt;

The same conclusion holds if we have the difference of two terms

:&lt;math&gt; c = a-b &lt;/math&gt;

'''Rule4-''' In the sum of two terms, if two terms are same order of magnitude,

:&lt;math&gt; c = a+b  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; O(a) = O(b)  &lt;/math&gt;

then the sum is also of same order of magnitude:

:&lt;math&gt; O(a) \thicksim O(b) \thicksim O(c)  &lt;/math&gt;

'''Rule5-''' In case of product of two terms

:&lt;math&gt; p=ab &lt;/math&gt;

the order of magnitude of the product is equal to the product of the orders of magnitude of the two factors

:&lt;math&gt; O(p) = O(a)O(b)  &lt;/math&gt;

for ratios

:&lt;math&gt; r = \frac{a}{b}  &lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt; O(r) = \frac{O(a)}{O(b)}  &lt;/math&gt;

here O(a) represents the order of magnitude of a.

~ represents two terms are of same order of magnitude.

&gt; represents greater than, in the sense of order-of-magnitude.

==Scale analysis of fully developed flow==

Consider the steady laminar flow of a viscous fluid inside a circular tube. Let the fluid enter with a uniform velocity over the flow across section. As the fluid moves down the tube a boundary layer of low-velocity fluid forms and grows on the surface because the fluid immediately adjacent to the surface have zero velocity. A particular and simplifying feature of viscous flow inside cylindrical tubes is the fact that the boundary layer must meet itself at the tube centerline, and the velocity distribution then establishes a fixed pattern that is invariant. Hydrodynamic entrance length is that part of the tube in which the momentum boundary layer grows and the velocity distribution changes with length. The fixed velocity distribution in the fully developed region is called fully developed velocity profile.
The steady-state continuity and conservation of momentum equations in two-dimensional are

:&lt;math&gt;{{\partial u }\over{\partial x }} + {\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}}=0 , \qquad(1)  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; u {{\partial u }\over{\partial x }} + v {\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}} = - { { \frac{1}{\varrho}}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}}} + 
\nu \left({\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}}+{\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}}\right),\qquad(2)  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; u {{\partial v }\over{\partial x }} + v {\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}} = - { { \frac{1}{\varrho}}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}}} + 
\nu \left({\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}}+{\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2}}\right),\qquad(3)  &lt;/math&gt;

These equations can be simplified by using scale analysis. At any point &lt;math&gt;x\sim L &lt;/math&gt; in fully developed zone, we have &lt;math&gt;y\sim\delta &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u\sim U_\infty &lt;/math&gt;. Now, from equation(1), 
the transverse velocity component in fully developed region simplified using scaling as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
v &amp;\sim {\frac{U_{\infty} \delta}{L}}  \qquad(4) 
\end{align} 
&lt;/math&gt;
In fully developed region the section of the duct flow far from inlet such that scale of transverse velocity component v is negligible(L&gt;&gt;d).So, in fully developed flow limit, 
continuity equation requires

:&lt;math&gt;v=0,  {{\partial u }\over{\partial x }}=0  \qquad(5)  &lt;/math&gt;

Based on equation(5), the y momentum equation eq3 reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;{{\partial P }\over{\partial y }}=0  \qquad(6)  &lt;/math&gt;

this means that P is function of x only. From this, the x momentum equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;{{d P }\over{d x }}=\mu {{d^2 u}\over{d y^2 }}=constant \qquad(7)  &lt;/math&gt;

Each term should be constant, because left side is function of x only and right is function of y. Solving equation(7) subject to the boundary condition

:&lt;math&gt; u=0, y=\pm \frac{D}{2}  \qquad(8) &lt;/math&gt;

this results in the well-known Hagen–Poiseuille solution for fully developed flow between parallel plates.

:&lt;math&gt; u=\frac{3}{2}U[1-{(\frac{y}{D/2})}^2]  \qquad(9) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; U=\frac{D^2}{12\mu}(-\frac{dP}{dx})  \qquad(10) &lt;/math&gt;

where y is measured away from the center of the channel. The velocity is to be parabolic and is proportional to the pressure per unit duct length in the direction of the flow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3354">The '''School of Antioch''' was one of the two major centers of the study of biblical [[exegesis]] and [[theology]] during [[Late Antiquity]]; the other was the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]]. This group was known by this name because the advocates of this tradition were based in the city of [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]], one of the major cities of the ancient [[Roman Empire]]. 

While the Christian intellectuals of Alexandria emphasized the [[allegorical]] interpretation of Scriptures and tended toward a [[Christology]] that emphasized the union of the human and the divine, those in Antioch held to a more literal and occasionally [[Typology (theology)|typological]] exegesis and a Christology that emphasized the distinction between the human and the divine in the person of [[Jesus Christ]]. The school in general tended to what might be called, in a rather loose sense, an [[Adoptionism|Adoptionist]] Christology.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Adoptianism''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nestorius]], before becoming Patriarch of Constantinople, had been a monk at Antioch and had there become imbued with the principles of the Antiochene theological school.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Nestorius''&lt;/ref&gt;

The school of Antioch is best divided into three periods: 
* the early school (170-early fourth century)
The earliest author known of this period is [[Theophilus of Antioch]]. Then there is a gap of a century and in the first half of the fifth century there are three known antiochene authors: the best known is [[Eusebius of Emesa]]; other representatives are [[Acacius of Caesarea]] and Theodore bishop of Heraklea.
* the middle school (350-433)
This period includes at least three different generations: [[Diodorus of Tarsus]], who directed an ἀσκητήριον (school) he may have founded. Among his disciples, the best known are [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Theodore of Mopsuestia|Theodorus of Mopsuestia]]. The main figure of the third generation was [[Nestorius]].
* the late school (after 433).
After the [[Council of Ephesus]] (431), the School of Antioch loses prestige. However, after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451), the Antiochian school becomes the sole theological school within [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern]] and [[Roman Catholic|Western]] Christianity, where the [[Oriental Orthodox|Far-Eastern Churches]] adopted the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria|Alexandrian School of Theology]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Apparently only two later authors are known: [[Basil of Seleucia]] and [[Gennadius of Constantinople]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

'''Sunflecks''' are brief increases in solar irradiance that occur in [[understory|understories]] of an ecosystem when sunlight is able to directly reach the ground. They are caused by either wind moving branches and/or leaves in the canopy or as the sun moves during the day. Although each sunfleck only last for seconds or minutes at a time, they can be responsible more than 80% of the [[photon]]s that reach plants in the understory, and up to 35% of [[carbon fixation]]. This makes them important sources of energy for plants in the understory of forests. The amount of energy that a sunfleck provides depends on their duration, size and shape and the intensity of [[photosynthetically active radiation]] (PAR), which itself depends on the arrangement of vegetation in the canopy and the position of the sun in the sky.&lt;ref name=chazdon&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Chazdon | first1 = R.

The abundance of sunflecks varies greatly both within and between ecosystems, generally the frequency and intensity of sunflecks decreases as tree {i.e., plant or canopy} height and the [[leaf area index]] increase.&lt;ref name=chazdon/&gt;

There is no clear distinction between sunflecks and sunpatches, although the latter tend to last for at least an hour and the intensity of PAR reaches the full level of sunlight, whereas the intensity of PAR in sunflecks rarely reaches this. Because the amount of diffuse sunlight reaching the forest floor varies depending on the type of forest, there is no way to quantify an intensity of direct sunlight that qualifies as a sunfleck.&lt;ref name=chazdon/&gt;

The '''teleological''' or '''physico-theological argument''', also known as the '''argument from design''', or '''intelligent design argument''' is an argument for the [[existence of God]] or, more generally, for an intelligent creator based on perceived evidence of [[intelligent design|deliberate design]] in the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |title=teleological argument |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/teleological_argument}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Francisco J. Ayala]] (2006), Review article of "The Blasphemy of Intelligent Design: Creationism's Trojan Horse. The Wedge of Intelligent Design" by Barbara Forrest; Paul R. Gross ''History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences'', Vol. 28, No. 3, pp. 409–421, {{JSTOR|23334140}}.: "The argument from design to demonstrate God's existence, now called the 'Intelligent Design' argument (ID) is a two-tined argument. The first prong asserts that the universe, humans, as well as all sorts of organisms, in their wholes, in their parts, and in their relations to one another and to their environment, appear to have been designed for serving certain functions and for certain ways of life. The second prong of the argument is that only an omnipotent Creator could account for the perfection and purposeful design of the universe and everything in it."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~grosen/puc/phi203/design.html |title=The Argument from Design |publisher= [[Princeton University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest recorded versions of this argument are associated with [[Socrates]] in [[ancient Greece]], although it has been argued that he was taking up an older argument.&lt;ref name=comp&gt;Ahbel-Rappe, S. and Kamtekar, R., ''A Companion to Socrates'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, p. 45. "Xenophon attributes to Socrates what is probably the earliest known natural theology, an argument for the existence of the gods from observations of design in the physical world."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007) agrees (p.&amp;nbsp;86), and cites other recent commentators who agree, and argues in detail that the argument reported by Xenophon and Plato is "at any rate the antecedent" of the argument from design (p.&amp;nbsp;213). He shows that the Stoics frequently paraphrased the account given by Xenophon.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]], his student, and [[Aristotle]], Plato's student, developed complex approaches to the proposal that the cosmos has an intelligent cause, but it was the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] who, under their influence, "developed the battery of creationist arguments broadly known under the label 'The Argument from Design{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Sedley 2007, page xvii"&gt;Sedley 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abrahamic religion]]s have used the teleological argument in many ways, and has a long association with them. In the [[Middle Ages]], Islamic theologians such as [[Al-Ghazali]] used the argument, although it was rejected as unnecessary by [[Quran]]ic literalists, and as unconvincing by many [[Islamic philosophers]]. Later, the teleological argument was accepted by [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] and included as the fifth of his "[[Quinque viae|Five Ways]]" of proving the existence of God. In early modern England clergymen such as [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]] and [[John Ray]] were well-known proponents. In the early 18th century, [[William Derham]] published his ''Physico-Theology'', which gave his "demonstration of the being and attributes of God from his works of creation".&lt;ref&gt;Derham, W., ''Physico-Theology'', 1713&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[William Paley]], in his 1802 ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'' published a prominent presentation of the design argument with his version of the [[watchmaker analogy]] and the first use of the phrase "argument from design".&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' under "Design", substantive number 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

From its beginning, there have been numerous criticisms of the different versions of the teleological argument, and responses to its challenge to the claims against non-teleological natural science. Especially important were the general logical arguments made by [[David Hume]] in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'', published 1779, and the explanation of biological complexity given in [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[Origin of Species]]'', published in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.be/books?id=Zp5pAgAAQBAJ The Oxford Handbook of Natural Theology], p.&amp;nbsp;3, for example: "Between them, so the story goes, Hume, Darwin and Barth pulled the rug out from underneath the pretensions of natural theology to any philosophical, scientific, or theological legitimacy".&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, Paley's arguments, including the words "[[intelligent design]]", have been influential in the development of a [[creation science]] movement, especially the form known as the [[intelligent design movement]], which not only uses the teleological argument to argue against the modern scientific understanding of [[evolution]], but also makes the claim that supposed flaws in evolutionary science justify removing it from the educational curriculum.&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt;

Also starting already in classical Greece, two approaches to the teleological argument developed, distinguished by their understanding of whether the natural order was literally created or not. The non-creationist approach starts most clearly with Aristotle, although many thinkers, such as the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], believed it was already intended by Plato. This approach is not creationist in a simple sense, because while it agrees that a cosmic intelligence is responsible for the natural order, it rejects the proposal that this requires a "creator" to physically make and maintain this order. The Neoplatonists did not find the teleological argument convincing, and in this they were followed by medieval philosophers such as [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]]. Later, [[Averroes]] and Thomas Aquinas considered the argument acceptable, but not necessarily the best argument.

Contemporary defenders of the teleological argument are [[Antony Flew]], [[Richard Swinburne]] and [[John Lennox]].

== History ==

While the concept of an intelligence behind the natural order is ancient, a rational argument that concludes that we can know that the natural world has a designer, or a creating intelligence which has human-like purposes, appears to have begun with [[classical philosophy]].&lt;ref name=comp /&gt; Religious thinkers in [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] also developed versions of the teleological argument. Later, variants on the argument from design were produced in [[Western philosophy]] and by [[Christian fundamentalism]].

=== Classical philosophy ===

====Socrates and the pre-Socratics====
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato and [[Aristotle]], depicted here in ''[[The School of Athens]]'', both developed philosophical arguments addressing the universe's apparent order (''[[logos]]'')]]

The argument from intelligent design appears to have begun with [[Socrates]], although the concept of a cosmic intelligence is older and [[David Sedley]] has argued that Socrates was developing an older idea, citing [[Anaxagoras of Clazomenae]], born about 500 BC, as a possible earlier proponent.&lt;ref name=mcpherr/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahbel/&gt;&lt;ref name=sed/&gt; The proposal that the order of nature showed evidence of having its own human-like "intelligence" goes back to the origins of Greek natural philosophy and science, and its attention to the orderliness of nature, often with special reference to the revolving of the heavens. Anaxagoras is the first person who is definitely known to have explained such a concept using the word "''[[nous]]''" (which is the original Greek term that leads to modern English "intelligence" via its Latin and French translations). Aristotle reports an earlier philosopher from [[Clazomenae]] named [[Hermotimus of Clazomenae|Hermotimus]] who had taken a similar position.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' I.4.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Met.+1.984b 984b].&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst [[Pre-Socratic philosophers]] before Anaxagoras, other philosophers had proposed a similar intelligent ordering principle causing life and the rotation of the heavens. For example [[Empedocles]], like [[Hesiod]] much earlier, described cosmic order and living things as caused by a cosmic version of [[love]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}} Chapter X.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pythagoras]] and [[Heraclitus]] attributed the cosmos with "[[reason]]" (''[[logos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}}. See pages 204 and 235.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Philebus]]'' 28c [[Plato]] has Socrates speak of this as a tradition, saying that "all philosophers agree—whereby they really exalt themselves—that mind (''nous'') is king of heaven and earth.

Xenophon's report in his ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'' might be the earliest clear account of an argument that there is evidence in nature of intelligent design.&lt;ref name=ahbel&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKewlVwJ9rgC&amp;pg=PA27|page=27|title=Socrates: A Guide for the Perplexed| first=Sara |last=Ahbel-Rappe|isbn=9780826433251|date=2009-08-30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word traditionally translated and discussed as "design" is ''[[wikt:γνώμη|gnōmē]]'' and Socrates is reported by Xenophon to have pressed doubting young men to look at things in the market, and consider whether they could tell which things showed evidence of ''gnōmē'', and which seemed more to be by blind chance, and then to compare this to nature and consider whether it could be by blind chance.&lt;ref name=mcpherr&gt;{{citation|title=The Religion of Socrates| first=Mark |last= McPherran|year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nWfQx1CjZl0C&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=socrates+religion+%22intelligent+design%22#v=onepage&amp;q=socrates%20religion%20%22intelligent%20design%22&amp;f=false|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press| isbn=978-0271040325 }}, pp. 273–275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sed&gt;{{citation|title=Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity|first=David|last=Sedley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgRuJEfzUG8C|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520934368}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'', Socrates is made to say just before dying that his discovery of Anaxagoras' concept of a cosmic ''nous'' as the cause of the order of things, was an important turning point for him. But he also expressed disagreement with Anaxagoras' understanding of the implications of his own doctrine, because of Anaxagoras' [[materialism|materialist]] understanding of [[Causality|causation]]. Socrates complained that Anaxagoras restricted the work of the cosmic ''nous'' to the beginning, as if it were uninterested and all events since then just happened because of causes like air and water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D97 97]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D98 98].

====Plato and Aristotle====
Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' is presented as a description of someone who is explaining a "likely story" in the form of a myth, and so throughout history commentators have disagreed about which elements of the myth can be seen as the position of Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;132.&lt;/ref&gt; Sedley nevertheless calls it "the creationist manifesto" and points out that although some of Plato's followers denied that he intended it, in classical times writers such as Aristotle, Epicurus, the Stoics and Galen all understood Plato as proposing the world originated in an "intelligent creative act".&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;133.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato has a character explain the concept of a "[[demiurge]]" with supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the cosmos in his work .

Plato's teleological perspective is also built upon the analysis of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' order and structure in the world that he had already presented in ''[[Republic (dialogue)|The Republic]]''. The story does not propose creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''; rather, the demiurge made order from the chaos of the cosmos, imitating the eternal Forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plato/ | title=Plato | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=April 21, 2005 | accessdate=November 12, 2011 | last1=Brickhouse | first1=Thomas | last2=Smith | first2=Nicholas D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hankinson|Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought}}

Plato's student and friend Aristotle (c. 384 – 322 BC), continued the Socratic tradition of criticising natural scientists such as [[Democritus]] who sought (as in modern science) to explain everything in terms of matter and chance motion. He was very influential in the future development of classical creationism, but was not a straightforward "creationist" because he required no creation interventions in nature, meaning he "insulated god from any requirement to intervene in nature, either as creator or as administrator".&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;204.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of direct intervention by a creator it is "scarcely an exaggeration to say that for Aristotle the entire functioning of the natural world, as also the heavens, is ultimately to be understood as a shared striving towards godlike [[actuality]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;171.&lt;/ref&gt; And whereas the myth in the ''Timaeus'' suggests that all living things are based on one single paradigm, not one for each species, and even tells a story of "devolution" whereby other living things devolved from humans, it was Aristotle who presented the influential idea that each type of normal living thing must be based on a fixed paradigm or form for that species.&lt;ref name=sed/&gt;

Aristotle felt that biology was a particularly important example of a field where materialist natural science ignored information which was needed in order to understand living things well. For example birds use wings for the purpose of flight.&lt;ref name="HistAnimI2"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/history_anim.1.i.html#223 |title=History of Animals |author=Aristotle |at=I 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore the most complete explanation in regard to the natural, as well as the artificial, is for the most part teleological.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1985"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.C. |last=Nussbaum |year=1985 |title=Aristotle's de Motu Animalium |series=Princeton paperbacks |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-02035-8 |lccn=77072132 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISD05P7TcOAC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;pg=PA60 |page=60,66,69–70,73–81,94–98,101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, proposals that species had changed by chance survival of the fittest, similar to what is now called "[[natural selection]]", were already known to Aristotle, and he rejected these with the same logic.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PhysI2"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.1.i.html#130 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=I 2 (¶15)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PartsAnimI1"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/parts_animals.1.i.html#100 |title=Parts of Animals |author=Aristotle |at=I 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross2004"&gt;{{cite book |first=D. |last=Ross |first2=J.L. |last2=Ackrill |year=2004 |title=Aristotle |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-32857-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=651Bg2-8xsEC&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;pg=PA80 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HullRuse2007"&gt;{{cite book |first=D.L. |last=Hull |first2=M. |last2=Ruse |year=2007 |title=The Cambridge Companion to the Philosophy of Biology |series=Cambridge Companions to Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-61671-3 |lccn=2006025898 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZOgg-x4UyIC&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;pg=PA174 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conceded that monstrosities (new forms of life) could come about by chance,&lt;ref name="PhysII8a"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html#530 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=II 8 &amp;nbsp;(¶2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PhysII8b"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html#585 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=II 8 &amp;nbsp;(¶5)}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he disagreed with those who ascribed all nature purely to chance&lt;ref name="PhysII8c"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html#604 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=II 8 &amp;nbsp;(¶8)}}&lt;/ref&gt; because he believed science can only provide a general account of that which is normal, "always, or for the most part".&lt;ref name="PhysII8"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html#522 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=II 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between what is normal, or by nature, and what is "accidental", or not by nature, is important in Aristotle's understanding of nature. As pointed out by Sedley, "Aristotle is happy to say (''Physics'' II 8, 199a33-b4) without the slightest fear of blasphemy, crafts make occasional mistakes; therefore, by analogy, so can nature".&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;186.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle the changes which happen by nature are caused by their "[[formal cause]]s", and for example in the case of a bird's wings there is also a [[final cause]] which is the purpose of flying. He explicitly compared this to human technology:
{{quotation|If then what comes from art is for the sake of something, it is clear that what come from nature is too [...] This is clear most of all in the other animals, which do nothing by art, inquiry, or deliberation; for which reason some people are completely at a loss whether it is by intelligence or in some other way that spiders, ants, and such things work. [...] It is absurd to think that a thing does not happen for the sake of something if we do not see what sets it in motion deliberating. [...] This is most clear when someone practices medicine himself on himself; for nature is like that.|Aristotle, Physics, II 8.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs translation (1998), ''Aristotle's physics; a guided study'', 2nd ed., pages 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The question of how to understand Aristotle's conception of nature having a purpose and direction something like human activity is controversial in the details. [[Martha Nussbaum]] for example has argued that in his biology this approach was practical and meant to show nature only being analogous to human art, explanations of an organ being greatly informed by knowledge of its essential function.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1985"/&gt; Nevertheless, Nussbaum's position is not universally accepted. In any case, Aristotle was not understood this way by his followers in the Middle Ages, who saw him as consistent with monotheistic religion and a teleological understanding of all nature. Consistent with the medieval interpretation, in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' and other works Aristotle clearly argued a case for their being one highest god or "[[prime mover theory|prime mover]]" which was the ultimate cause, though specifically not the material cause, of the eternal forms or natures which cause the natural order, including all living things. And he clearly refers to this entity having an [[active intellect|intellect]] that humans somehow share in, which helps humans see the true natures or forms of things without relying purely on sense perception of physical things, including living species. This understanding of nature, and Aristotle's arguments against materialist understandings of nature, were very influential in the Middle Ages in Europe. The idea of fixed species remained dominant in biology until Darwin, and a focus upon biology is still common today in teleological criticisms of modern science.

====Roman era====
It was the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] who "developed the battery of creationist arguments broadly known under the label 'The Argument from Design{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Sedley 2007, page xvii"/&gt; Cicero (c. 106 – c. 43 BC) reported the teleological argument of the Stoics in ''De Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods)'' Book II, which includes an early version of the watchmaker analogy, which was later developed by William Paley. He has one of the characters in the dialogue say:
{{Quotation|When you see a sundial or a water-clock, you see that it tells the time by design and not by chance. How then can you imagine that the universe as a whole is devoid of purpose and intelligence, when it embraces everything, including these artifacts themselves and their artificers?|Cicero|''De Natura Deorum''|II.34}}

Another very important classical supporter of the teleological argument was [[Galen]], whose compendious works were one of the major sources of medical knowledge until modern times, both in Europe and the medieval Islamic world. He was not a Stoic, but like them he looked back to the Socratics and was constantly engaged in arguing against atomists such as the Epicureans. Unlike Aristotle (who was however a major influence upon him), and unlike the Neoplatonists, he believed there was really evidence for something literally like the "demiurge" found in Plato's ''Timaeus'', which worked physical upon nature. In works such as his ''On the Usefulness of Parts'' he explained evidence for it in the complexity of animal construction. His work shows "early signs of contact and contrast between the pagan and the Judaeo-Christian tradition of creation", criticizing the account found in the Bible. "Moses, he suggests, would have contented himself with saying that God ordered the eyelashes not to grow and that they obeyed. In contrast to this, the Platonic tradition's Demiurge is above all else a technician." Surprisingly, neither Aristotle nor Plato, but Xenophon are considered by Galen, as the best writer on this subject. Galen shared with Xenophon a scepticism of the value of books about most speculative philosophy, except for inquiries such as whether there is "something in the world superior in power and wisdom to man". This he saw as having an everyday importance, a usefulness for living well. He also asserted that Xenophon was the author who reported the real position of Socrates, including his aloofness from many types of speculative science and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007) ''Epilogue''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galen's connection of the teleological argument to discussions about the complexity of living things, and his insistence that this is possible for a practical scientist, foreshadows some aspects of modern uses of the teleological argument.

===Medieval philosophy and theology===

====Late classical Christian writers====
As an appeal to [[general revelation]], [[Paul the Apostle]] (AD 5–67), argues in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1:18–20{{Bibleref2c-nb|Ro|1:18–20}}, that because it has been made plain to all from what has been created in the world, it is obvious that there is a God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Christian philosophy as natural theology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67536/Christian-philosophy-as-natural-theology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcus Minucius Felix]] (c. late 2nd to 3rd century), an Early Christian writer, argued for the existence of God based on the analogy of an ordered house in his ''The Orders of Minucius Felix'': "Supposing you went into a house and found everything neat, orderly and well-kept, surely you would assume it had a master, and one
much better than the good things, his belongings ; so in this house of the universe, when throughout
heaven and earth you see the marks of foresight, order and law, may you not assume that the lord and
author of the universe is fairer than the stars themselves or than any portions of the entire world ?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Octavius of Minucius Felix | publisher=OrthodoxEbook | author=Marcus Minucius Felix | year=2010 | pages=359–361 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OZqxbh23sQC&amp;lpg=PA360&amp;dq=Marcus%20Minucius%20Felix%20ordered%20house&amp;pg=PA359#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] (AD 354–430) in [[The City of God]] mentioned the idea that the world's "well-ordered changes and movements", and "the fair appearance of all visible things" was evidence for the world being created, and "that it could not have been created save by God".&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book XI, Chapter 4. "the world itself, by its well-ordered changes and movements, and by the fair appearance of all visible things, bears a testimony of its own, both that it has been created, and also that it could not have
been created save by God, whose greatness and beauty are unutterable and invisible."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Islamic philosophy ====
Early Islamic philosophy played an important role in developing the philosophical understandings of God among Jewish and Christian thinkers in the Middle Ages, but concerning the teleological argument one of the lasting effects of this tradition came from its discussions of the difficulties which this type of proof has. Various forms of the argument from design have been used by Islamic theologians and philosophers from the time of the early [[Mutakallimun]] theologians in the 9th century, although it is rejected by fundamentalist or literalist schools, for whom the mention of God in the Qu'ran should be sufficient evidence. The argument from design was also seen as an unconvincing sophism by the early Islamic philosopher [[Al-Farabi]], who instead took the "emanationist" approach of the Neoplatonists such as Plotinus, whereby nature is rationally ordered, but God is not like a craftsman who literally manages the world. Later, [[Avicenna]] was also convinced of this, and proposed instead a cosmological argument for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Avicenna |first=Lenn Evan |last=Goodman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=779JPlxYtGoC&amp;pg=PA63| page=63| publisher= Cornell university press| year=1992|isbn=978-0801472541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument was however later accepted by both the Aristotelian philosopher [[Averroes]] (Ibn Rushd) and his great anti-philosophy opponent [[Al-Ghazali]]. Averroes' term for the argument was ''Dalīl al-ˁināya'', which can be translated as "argument from providence". Both of them however accepted the argument ''because'' they believed it is explicitly mentioned in the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Kitāb al-Dalīl al-Kabīr| editor-first= Binyāmîn |editor-last=Abrahamov |chapter=Introduction| first=Binyāmîn |last=Abrahamov |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SYqKHJFAhr8C |year=1990| publisher=Brill| isbn= 978-9004089853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, like Aristotle, the Neoplatonists, and Al-Farabi, Averroes proposed that order and continual motion in the world is caused by God's intellect. Whether Averroes was an "emanationist" like his predecessors has been a subject of disagreement and uncertainty. But it is generally agreed that what he adapted from those traditions, agreed with them about the fact that God does not create in the same way as a craftsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Averroes and the metaphysics of causation | publisher=SUNY Press | author=Kogan, Barry S. | year=1985 | pages=240–243 | isbn=978-0-88706-063-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAyv0Ayy-R0C&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=teleological%20argument%20averroes&amp;pg=PA240#v=snippet&amp;q=teleological%20argument&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catarina Carriço Marques de Moura Belo ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b4Nii9xOmTYC Chance and Determinism in Avicenna and Averroës]''. See for example p.&amp;nbsp;194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact then, Averroes treated the teleological argument as one of two "religious" arguments for the existence of God. The principal demonstrative proof is, according to Averroes, Aristotle's proof from motion in the universe that there must be a first mover which causes everything else to move.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlos Fraenkel]] "Philosophical Religions from Plato to Spinoza: Reason, Religion, and Autonomy", p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2wYgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199 199].&lt;/ref&gt; Averroes' position that the most logically valid proof should be physical rather than metaphysical (because then metaphysics would be proving itself) was in conscious opposition to the position of Avicenna. Later Jewish and Christian philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas were aware of this debate, and generally took a position closer to Avicenna.

====Jewish philosophy====
An example of the teleological argument in [[Jewish philosophy]] appears when the medieval Aristotelian philosopher [[Maimonides]] cites the passage in [[Isaiah]] 40:26, where the "Holy One" says: "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number:"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+40%3A26&amp;version=AKJV King James Version of the Bible]
&lt;/ref&gt; However, Barry Holtz calls this "a crude form of the argument from design", and that this "is only one possible way of reading the text". He asserts that "Generally, in the biblical texts the existence of God is taken for granted."&lt;ref&gt;Holtz, B., ''Back to the Sources'', Simon and Schuster, 2008, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maimonides also recalled that [[Abraham]] (in the [[midrash]], or explanatory text, of [[Genesis Rabbah]] 39:1) recognized the existence of "one transcendent deity from the fact that the world around him exhibits an order and design".&lt;ref name=Koch/&gt; The [[midrash]] makes an analogy between the obviousness that a building has an owner, and that the world is looked after by God. Abraham says "Is it conceivable that the world is without a guide?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/RabbaGenesis/midrashrabbahgen027557mbp#page/n359/mode/2up ''Genesis Rabbah'', 39:1]
&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these examples, the 19th century philosopher [[Nachman Krochmal]] called the argument from design "a cardinal principle of the Jewish faith".&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;Harris, J.M., ''Nachman Krochmal: Guiding the Perplexed of the Modern Age'', NYU Press, 1991, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American orthodox rabbi, [[Aryeh Kaplan]], retells a legend about the 2nd century AD [[Rabbi Meir]]. When told by a philosopher that he did not believe that the world was created by God, the rabbi produced a beautiful poem that he claimed had come into being when a cat accidentally knocked over a pot of ink, "spilling ink all over the document. This poem was the result." The philosopher exclaims that would be impossible: "There must be an author. There must be a scribe." The rabbi concludes, "How could the universe ... come into being by itself? There must be an Author. There must be a Creator."&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, A., ''The Aryeh Kaplan Anthology: Illuminating Expositions on Jewish Thought and Practice by a Revered Teacher'', Volume 1, Mesorah Publications, 1991, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thomism ====
[[File:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|upright|The fifth of Thomas Aquinas' proofs of God's existence was based on teleology]]

Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), whose writings became widely accepted within Catholic western Europe, was heavily influenced by Aristotle, Averroes, and other Islamic and Jewish philosophers. He presented a teleological argument in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. In the work, Aquinas presented five ways in which he attempted to prove the existence of God: the ''[[quinque viae]]''. These arguments feature only ''a posteriori'' arguments, rather than literal reading of holy texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Thought of Thomas Aquinas | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Davies, Brian | year=1992 | page=30, footnote 30 | isbn=978-0-19-152044-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxrDzeKU2VsC&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=aquinas%20teleological%20argument%20aristotle&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q=aquinas%20teleological%20argument%20aristotle&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sums up his teleological argument as follows:

{{Quote|The fifth way is taken from the governance of the world. We see that things which lack knowledge, such as natural bodies, act for an end, and this is evident from their acting always, or nearly always, in the same way, so as to obtain the best result. Hence it is plain that they achieve their end, not fortuitously, but designedly. Now whatever lacks knowledge cannot move towards an end, unless it be directed by some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence; as the arrow is directed by the archer. Therefore, some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end; and this being we call God. |St Thomas Aquinas|''Summa Theologica: Article 3, Question 2)''&lt;ref name="Himma"&gt;Himma, Kenneth Einar (2006). [http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/design.htm#SH1b "Design Arguments for the Existence of God"], in James Fieser and Bradley Dowden, eds., ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', retrieved 8/24/08&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aquinas notes that the existence of [[final cause]]s, by which a cause is directed toward an effect, can only be explained by an appeal to intelligence. However, as natural bodies aside from humans do not possess intelligence, there must, he reasons, exist a being that directs final causes at every moment. That being is what we call God.&lt;ref name="Himma" /&gt;

===Modernity===

==== Newton and Leibniz ====
[[Isaac Newton]] affirmed his belief in the truth of the argument when, in 1713, he wrote these words in an appendix to the second edition of his [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;This most elegant system of the sun, planets, and comets could not have arisen without the design and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, I., quoted in Huyssteen, JWV. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Science and Religion'', Macmillan, 2003, p. 621.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;This view, that "God is known from his works", was supported and popularized by Newton's friends [[Richard Bentley]], [[Samuel Clarke]] and [[William Whiston]] in the [[Boyle lectures]], which Newton supervised.&lt;ref&gt;Leshem, A., ''Newton on Mathematics and Spiritual Purity'', Springer, 2003, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton wrote to Bentley, just before Bentley delivered the first lecture, that:&lt;blockquote&gt;when I wrote my treatise about our Systeme I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the beliefe [sic] of a Deity, and nothing can rejoice me more than to find it useful for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Leshem, A., ''Newton on Mathematics and Spiritual Purity'', Springer, 2003, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] disagreed with Newton's view of design in the teleological argument. In the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]], Samuel Clarke argued Newton's case that God constantly intervenes in the world to keep His design adjusted, while Leibniz thought that the universe was created in such a way that God would not need to intervene at all. As quoted by Ayval Leshem, Leibniz wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;According to [Newton's] doctrine, God Almighty wants [i.e. needs] to wind up his watch from time to time; otherwise it would cease to move. He had not it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion&lt;ref&gt;Leshem, A., ''Newton on Mathematics and Spiritual Purity'', Springer, 2003, pp. 21–22.[https://books.google.com/books?id=fD-qvJp0Q5kC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=argument+from+design+%22Samuel+Clarke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h_xkU8jdEc7vOa7pgfAL&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=argument%20from%20design%20%22Samuel%20Clarke%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Leibniz considered the argument from design to have "only moral certainty" unless it was supported by his own idea of [[pre-established harmony]] expounded in his [[Monadology]].&lt;ref&gt;Pomerlaeau, ''Western Philosophies Religion'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 1998, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that "The proof from the pre-established harmony is a particular form of the so-called physico-theological proof, otherwise known as the argument from design." According to Leibniz, the universe is completely made from individual substances known as [[monad (philosophy)|monads]], programmed to act in a predetermined way.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': "monads are basic substances that make up the universe but lack spatial extension and hence are immaterial. Each monad is a unique, indestructible, dynamic, soullike entity whose properties are a function of its perceptions and appetites."&lt;/ref&gt; Russell wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;In Leibniz's form, the argument states that the harmony of all the monads can only have arisen from a common cause. That they should all exactly synchronize, can only be explained by a Creator who pre-determined their synchronism.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B., ''A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz,'', Routledge, 2005, First published 1900, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== British empiricists ====

The 17th-century [[Dutch people|Dutch]] writers [[Lessius]] and [[Grotius]] argued that the intricate structure of the world, like that of a house, was unlikely to have arisen by chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = James|last= Franklin | title = The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | year = 2001| location = Baltimore| pages = 244–5| isbn = 978-0-8018-6569-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The empiricist [[John Locke]], writing in the late 17th century, developed the Aristotelian idea that, excluding geometry, all science must attain its knowledge ''a posteriori'' - through sensual experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cambridge companion to Locke | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Claiborne Chappell, Vere | year=1994 | pages=161–164 | isbn=978-0-521-38772-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f28fFbiohXMC&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=locke%20a%20priori&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q=locke%20a%20priori&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Locke, Anglican Irish Bishop [[George Berkeley]] advanced a form of [[idealism]] in which things only continue to exist when they are perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Berkeley's Idealism: A Critical Examination | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Dicker, Georges | year=2011 | page=260 | isbn=978-0-19-538146-7 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=XBqQXI3JGeEC&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=teleological%20argument%20berkeley&amp;pg=PA260#v=onepage&amp;q=teleological%20argument%20berkeley&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; When humans do not perceive objects, they continue to exist because God is perceiving them. Therefore, in order for objects to remain in existence, God must exist omnipresently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berkeley/ | title=George Berkeley | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=November 17, 2011 | author=Downing, Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Hume, in the mid-18th century, referred to the teleological argument in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]''. Here, he appears to give his support to the argument from design. John Wright notes that "Indeed, he claims that the whole thrust of his analysis of causality in the Treatise supports the Design argument", and that, according to Hume, "we are obliged 'to infer an infinitely perfect Architect.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Wright, JP., in Traiger, S., ''The Blackwell Guide to Hume's Treatise'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, later he was more critical of the argument in his ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''. This was presented as a dialogue between Hume and "a friend who loves sceptical paradoxes", where the friend gives a version of the argument by saying of its proponents, they "paint in the most magnificent colours the order, beauty, and wise arrangement of the universe; and then ask if such a glorious display of intelligence could come from a random coming together of atoms, or if chance could produce something that the greatest genius can never sufficiently admire."&lt;ref&gt;Pomerleau, WP., ''Twelve Great Philosophers: A Historical Introduction to Human Nature'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1997, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume also presented arguments both for and against the teleological argument in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''. The character Cleanthes, summarizing the teleological argument, likens the universe to a man-made machine, and concludes by the principle of similar effects and similar causes that it must have a designing intelligence:
{{quotation|Look round the world: contemplate the whole and every part of it: You will find it to be nothing but one great-machine, subdivided into an infinite number of lesser machines, which again admit of subdivisions to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can trace and explain. All these various machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other with an accuracy, which ravishes into admiration all men who have ever contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of human contrivance; of human design, thought, wisdom, and intelligence. Since therefore the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble; and that the Author of Nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man; though possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work which he has executed. By this argument ''a posteriori,'' and by this argument alone, do we prove at once the existence of a Deity, and his similarity to human mind and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Hume1779" /&gt;}}
On the other hand, Hume's sceptic, Philo, is not satisfied with the argument from design. He attempts a number of refutations, including one that arguably foreshadows Darwin's theory, and makes the point that if God resembles a human designer, then assuming divine characteristics such as omnipotence and omniscience is not justified. He goes on to joke that far from being the perfect creation of a perfect designer, this universe may be "only the first rude essay of some infant deity... the object of derision to his superiors".&lt;ref name="Hume1779"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Hume |year=1779 |title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |edition=The Second |location=London |publisher=[[Sine nomine|s.n.]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7dbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Derham's natural theology ====
Starting in 1696 with his ''Artificial Clockmaker'', [[William Derham]] published a stream of teleological books. The best known of these are ''Physico-Theology'', 1713; ''Astro-Theology'', 1714; and ''Christo-Theology'', 1730. ''Physico-Theology'', for example, was explicitly subtitled "A demonstration of the being and attributes of God from his works of creation". A [[Natural theology|natural theologian]], Derham listed scientific observations of the many variations in nature, and proposed that these proved "the unreasonableness of infidelity". At the end of the section on Gravity for instance, he writes: "What else can be concluded, but that all was made with manifest Design, and that all the whole Structure is the Work of some intelligent Being; some Artist, of Power and Skill equivalent to such a Work?"&lt;ref&gt;Derham, W., ''Physico-Theology'', 1713, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, of the "sense of sound" he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For who but an intelligent Being, what less than an omnipotent and infinitely wise God could contrive, and make such a fine Body, such a Medium, so susceptible of every Impression, that the Sense of Hearing hath occasion for, to empower all Animals to express their Sense and Meaning to others.&lt;ref&gt;Derham, W., ''Physico-Theology'', 1713, pp. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Derham concludes: "For it is a Sign a Man is a wilful, perverse Atheist, that will impute so glorious a Work, as the Creation is, to any Thing, yea, a mere Nothing (as Chance is) rather than to God.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Physico_theology_Or_A_Demonstration_of_t.html?id=6Tm2CZLTl0wC Derham, W., ''Physico-Theology'', 1713, p. 328]&lt;/ref&gt; A.S. Weber writes that Derham's ''Physico-Theology'' "directly influenced" William Paley's later work.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, AS., ''Nineteenth-Century Science: An Anthology'', Broadview Press, 2000, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The power, and yet the limitations, of this kind of reasoning is illustrated in microcosm by the history of [[La Fontaine's Fables|La Fontaine's]] fable of [[The Acorn and the Pumpkin]], which first appeared in France in 1679. The light-hearted anecdote of how a doubting peasant is finally convinced of the wisdom behind creation arguably undermines this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Peter France, "The poet as a teacher" in ''Poetry in France: metamorphoses of a muse'', Edinburgh U 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;138&lt;/ref&gt; However, beginning with [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]]'s conversion of the story into a polemic against atheism, it has been taken up by a succession of moral writers as presenting a valid argument for the proposition that "The wisdom of God is displayed in creation".&lt;ref&gt;''Anecdotes and Examples illustrating the Catholic catechism'', New York 1904, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=--ELAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22the%20acorn%20and%20the%20pumpkin%22&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20acorn%20and%20the%20pumpkin%22&amp;f=false pp.&amp;nbsp;39–40]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Watchmaker analogy ====
[[File:WilliamPaley.jpg|thumb|[[William Paley]] popularized the "watchmaker analogy" used by earlier [[natural theology|natural theologians]], making it a famous teleological argument.]]
{{main|Watchmaker analogy}}

The [[watchmaker analogy]], framing the teleological argument with reference to a timepiece, dates at least back to the Stoics, who were reported by Cicero in his ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' (II.88), using such an argument against [[Epicureans]], whom, they taunt, would "think more highly of the achievement of [[Archimedes]] in making a model of the revolutions of the firmament than of that of nature in creating them, although the perfection of the original shows a craftsmanship many times as great as does the counterfeit".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=De natura deorum| url= https://archive.org/details/denaturadeorumac00ciceuoft| year=1933| publisher= London W. Heinemann}}, translated by H. Rackham. This is discussed at Sedley p.&amp;nbsp;207.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used by [[Robert Hooke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hooke | first = Rober |title = Micrographia | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 2003 |page = 2 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=0DYXk_9XX38C | isbn = 978-0-486-49564-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Voltaire]], the latter of whom remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The Universe troubles me, and much less can I think
That this clock exists and should have no clockmaker.&lt;ref&gt;Translation from ''Aristotle to Darwin and Back Again: A Journey in Final Causality, Species, and Evolution'' Etienne Gilson Ignatius Press, 2009 p. 126. Original: "L'univers m'embarrasse, et je ne puis songer Que cette horloge existe, et n'ait point d'horloger"; {{cite book | last = Voltaire | authorlink =Voltaire | title = Les cabales,: oeuvre pacifique | publisher = Oxford University, s. n., 1772  | location = | page = 9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ai8HAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Les%20Cabales%20Oeuvre%20Pacifique&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q=point%20d%27horloger&amp;f=false | doi = | isbn = 978-1-165-51896-8 | year = 1772}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Paley]] presented his version of the watchmaker analogy at the start of his ''Natural Theology'' (1802).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paley|1809|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=7 1].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[S]uppose I found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place, I should hardly think … that, for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there. Yet why should not this answer serve for the watch as well as for [a] stone [that happened to be lying on the ground]?… For this reason, and for no other; namely, that, if the different parts had been differently shaped from what they are, if a different size from what they are, or placed after any other manner, or in any order than that in which they are placed, either no motion at all would have been carried on in the machine, or none which would have answered the use that is now served by it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Alister McGrath]], Paley argued that "The same complexity and utility evident in the design and functioning of a watch can also be discerned in the natural world. Each feature of a biological organism, like that of a watch, showed evidence of being designed in such a way as to adapt the organism to survival within its environment. Complexity and utility are observed; the conclusion that they were designed and constructed by God, Paley holds, is as natural as it is correct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Darwinism and the Divine: Evolutionary Thought and Natural Theology | author = McGrath, AE. | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year =  2011 | page = 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural theology strongly influenced British science, with the expectation as expressed by [[Adam Sedgwick]] in 1831 that truths revealed by science could not conflict with the moral truths of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, E. Janet (1995), ''Charles Darwin: vol. 1 Voyaging'', London: Jonathan Cape, {{ISBN|1-84413-314-1}}, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; These natural philosophers saw God as the first cause, and sought secondary causes to explain design in nature: the leading figure Sir [[John Herschel]] wrote in 1836 that by analogy with other [[Physical law|intermediate causes]] "the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".&lt;ref name=hersch&gt;Wyhe, John van. (2007) ''Mind the gap: Did Darwin avoid publishing his theory for many years?''. Notes and Records of the Royal Society 61: 177–205. p. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=21 197]&lt;br /&gt;Babbage, Charles (1838) ''The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise''. 2nd edn. London: John Murray. pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A25&amp;pageseq=232 225–227]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a theology student, [[Charles Darwin]] found Paley's arguments compelling. However, he later developed his theory of [[evolution]] in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', which offers an alternate explanation of biological order. In his autobiography, Darwin wrote that "The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=61 59], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=89 87].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin struggled with the [[problem of evil]] and of suffering in nature, but remained inclined to believe that nature depended upon "designed laws" and commended [[Asa Gray]]'s statement about "Darwin's great service to Natural Science in bringing back to it Teleology: so that, instead of Morphology versus Teleology, we shall have Morphology wedded to Teleology."&lt;ref name="SMiles"&gt;Miles, Sara Joan, "[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2001/PSCF9-01Miles.html Charles Darwin and Asa Gray Discuss Teleology and Design]," ''PSCF'' (2001) 53: 196–201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin owned he was "bewildered" on the subject, but was "inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance":
&lt;blockquote&gt;But I own that I cannot see, as plainly as others do, &amp; as I shd wish to do, evidence of design &amp; beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent &amp; omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice. Not believing this, I see no necessity in the belief that the eye was expressly designed.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. ''More Letters of Charles Darwin'', ed. Francis Darwin, (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1903), p. 252. Quoted in Miles, Sara Joan, "[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2001/PSCF9-01Miles.html Charles Darwin and Asa Gray Discuss Teleology and Design]," ''PSCF'' (2001) 53: 196–201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Recent proponents===

====Probabilistic arguments====
In 1928 and 1930, [[Frederick Robert Tennant|F. R. Tennant]] published his ''Philosophical Theology'', which was a "bold endeavour to combine scientific and theological thinking".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Article on Tennant, Frederick Robert.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a version of the teleological argument based on the accumulation of the probabilities of each individual biological adaptation. "Tennant concedes that naturalistic accounts such as evolutionary theory may explain each of the individual adaptations he cites, but he insists that in this case the whole exceeds the sum of its parts: naturalism can explain each adaptation but not their totality."&lt;ref name=Rout/&gt; The ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' notes that "Critics have insisted on focusing on the cogency of each piece of theistic evidence – reminding us that, in the end, ten leaky buckets hold no more water than one." Also, "Some critics, such as [[John Hick]] and D.H. Mellor, have objected to Tennant's particular use of probability theory and have challenged the relevance of any kind of probabilistic reasoning to theistic belief."&lt;ref name=Rout&gt;Craig, E., ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy", Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998, Entry for "Tennant, Frederick Robert (1866–1957)."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Swinburne]]'s "contributions to philosophical theology have sought to apply more sophisticated versions of probability theory to the question of God's existence, a methodological improvement on Tennant's work but squarely in the same spirit".&lt;ref name=Rout/&gt; He uses [[Bayesian probability]] "taking account not only of the order and functioning of nature but also of the 'fit' between human intelligence and the universe, whereby one can understand its workings, as well as human aesthetic, moral, and religious experience".&lt;ref name=EB&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', entry on "Christian philosophy".&lt;/ref&gt; Swinburne writes: "the existence of order in the world confirms the existence of God if and only if the existence of this order in the world is more probable if there is a God than if there is not. ... the probability of order of the right kind is very much greater if there is a God, and so that the existence of such order adds greatly to the probability that there is a God."&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, R., ''The Existence of God'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Swinburne acknowledges that his argument by itself may not give a reason to believe in the existence of God, but in combination with other arguments such as [[cosmological argument]]s and evidence from [[mystical experience]], he thinks it can.

While discussing Hume's arguments, [[Alvin Plantinga]] offered a probability version of the teleological argument in his book ''[[God and Other Minds]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every ''contingent'' object such that we know whether or not it was the product of intelligent design, ''was'' the product of intelligent design.

The universe is a contingent object.

So probably the universe is designed.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, A., ''God and Other Minds: A Study of the Rational Justification of Belief in God'', Cornell University Press, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
Following Plantinga, Georges Dicker produced a slightly different version in his book about [[Bishop Berkeley]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A. The world ... shows amazing teleological order.

B. All Objects exhibiting such order ... are products of intelligent design.

C. Probably the world is a result of intelligent design.

D. Probably, God exists and created the world.&lt;ref&gt;Dicker, G., ''Berkeley's Idealism: A Critical Examination'', Oxford University Press, 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;262. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5yVwAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=plantinga+++%22argument+from+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vqVWU-zUOIOrhAe36ICwBA&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=plantinga%20%20%20%22argument%20from%20design%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' has the following criticism of such arguments:&lt;blockquote&gt; It can of course be said that any form in which the universe might be is statistically enormously improbable as it is only one of a virtual infinity of possible forms. But its actual form is no more improbable, in this sense, than innumerable others. It is only the fact that humans are part of it that makes it seem so special, requiring a transcendent explanation.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Fine-tuned Universe ====
{{Main|Fine-tuned Universe}}
A modern variation of the teleological argument is built upon the concept of the [[fine-tuned Universe]]: According to the website ''Biologos'': "Fine-tuning refers to the surprising precision of nature's physical constants, and the beginning state of the Universe. To explain the present state of the universe, even the best scientific theories require that the physical constants of nature and the beginning state of the Universe have extremely precise values."&lt;ref name="biologos.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biologos.org/questions/fine-tuning |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221081439/http://biologos.org/questions/fine-tuning |archivedate=2014-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the fine-tuning of the Universe is the apparent delicate balance of conditions necessary for human life. In this view, speculation about a vast range of possible conditions in which life cannot exist is used to explore the probability of conditions in which life can and does exist. For example, it can be argued that if the force of the [[Big Bang]] explosion had been different by 1/10 to the sixtieth power or the [[strong interaction|strong interaction force]] was only 5% different, life would be impossible.&lt;ref name="Himma2009"/&gt;Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking estimates that "if the rate of the universe's expansion one second after the Big Bang had been smaller by even one part in a hundred thousand million million, the universe would have re-collapsed into a hot fireball due to gravitational attraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1086/323074|title=Constraints on the Long‐Range Properties of Gravity from Weak Gravitational Lensing|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=560|issue=2|pages=539–543|year=2001|last1=White|first1=Martin|last2=Kochanek|first2=C. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of a teleological argument, the intuition in relation to a fine-tuned universe would be that God must have been responsible, if achieving such perfect conditions is so improbable.&lt;ref name="biologos.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Himma2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/design | title=Design Arguments for the Existence of God | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=12 April 2009 | accessdate=November 19, 2011 | author=Himma, Kenneth Einar}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in regard to fine-tuning, [[Kenneth Einar Himma]] writes: "The mere fact that it is enormously improbable that an event occurred... by itself, gives us no reason to think that it occurred by design ... As intuitively tempting as it may be..."&lt;ref name="Himma2009"/&gt; Himma attributes the "Argument from Suspicious Improbabilities", a formalization of "the fine-tuning intuition" to [[George N. Schlesinger]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;To understand Schlesinger's argument, consider your reaction to two different events. If John wins a 1-in-1,000,000,000 lottery game, you would not immediately be tempted to think that John (or someone acting on his behalf) cheated. If, however, John won three consecutive 1-in-1,000 lotteries, you would immediately be tempted to think that John (or someone acting on his behalf) cheated. Schlesinger believes that the intuitive reaction to these two scenarios is epistemically justified. The structure of the latter event is such that it… justifies a belief that intelligent design is the cause… Despite the fact that the probability of winning three consecutive 1-in-1,000 games is exactly the same as the probability of winning one 1-in-1,000,000,000 game, the former event… warrants an inference of intelligent design.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Himma considers Schlesinger's argument to be subject to the same vulnerabilities he noted in other versions of the design argument: &lt;blockquote&gt;While Schlesinger is undoubtedly correct in thinking that we are justified in suspecting design in the case [of winning] three consecutive lotteries, it is because—and only because—we know two related empirical facts about such events. First, we already know that there exist intelligent agents who have the right motivations and causal abilities to deliberately bring about such events. Second, we know from past experience with such events that they are usually explained by the deliberate agency of one or more of these agents. Without at least one of these two pieces of information, we are not obviously justified in seeing design in such cases… [T]he problem for the fine-tuning argument is that we lack both of the pieces that are needed to justify an inference of design. First, the very point of the argument is to establish the fact that there exists an intelligent agency that has the right causal abilities and motivations to bring the existence of a universe capable of sustaining life. Second, and more obviously, we do not have any past experience with the genesis of worlds and are hence not in a position to know whether the existence of fine-tuned universes are usually explained by the deliberate agency of some intelligent agency.

==== Creation science and intelligent design ====
{{Main|Intelligent design}}
A version of the argument from design is central to both [[creation science]] and [[Intelligent design]],&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt; but unlike Paley's openness to [[deism|deistic]] design through God-given laws, proponents seek scientific confirmation of repeated miraculous interventions in the history of life, and argue that their [[theistic science]] should be taught in science classrooms.&lt;ref name="PM 09"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Padian | first1 = K. | last2 = Matzke | first2 = N. | doi = 10.1042/bj20081534 | title = Darwin, Dover, 'Intelligent Design' and textbooks | journal = Biochemical Journal | volume = 417 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–42 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19061485| pmc = }} [http://www.biochemj.org/bj/417/0029/4170029.pdf .pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of [[evolution]] was effectively barred from United States public school curricula by the outcome of the 1925 [[Scopes Trial]], but in the 1960s the [[National Defense Education Act]] led to the [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study]] reintroducing the teaching of evolution. In response, there was a resurgence of [[creationism]], now presented as "creation science", based on biblical literalism but with Bible quotes optional. ("Explicit references to the Bible were optional: Morris's 1974 book ''Scientific Creationism'' came in two versions, one with Bible quotes, and one without."&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt;)

A 1989 survey found that virtually all literature promoting creation science presented the design argument, with [[John D. Morris]] saying "any living thing gives such strong evidence for design by an intelligent designer that only a willful ignorance of the data (II Peter 3:5) could lead one to assign such intricacy to chance." Such publications introduced concepts central to intelligent design, including ''[[irreducible complexity]]'' (a variant of the watchmaker analogy) and ''[[specified complexity]]'' (closely resembling a fine-tuning argument). The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling on ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' barred the teaching of "Creation Science" in public schools because it breached the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]], and a group of creationists rebranded Creation Science as "intelligent design" which was presented as a scientific theory rather than as a religious argument.&lt;ref name="SM 07"&gt;

Scientists disagreed with the assertion that intelligent design is scientific, and its introduction into the science curriculum of a [[Pennsylvania]] school district led to the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial, which ruled that the "intelligent design" arguments are essentially religious in nature and not science.&lt;ref name="Pigliucci2010"/&gt; The court took evidence from theologian [[John F. Haught]], and ruled that "ID is not a new scientific [[argument]], but is rather an old religious argument for the existence of God. He traced this argument back to at least Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century, who framed the argument as a syllogism: Wherever complex design exists, there must have been a designer; nature is complex; therefore nature must have had an intelligent designer." "This argument for the existence of God was advanced early in the 19th century by Reverend Paley": "The only apparent difference between the argument made by Paley and the argument for ID, as expressed by defense expert witnesses Behe and Minnich, is that ID's 'official position' does not acknowledge that the designer is God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

Proponents of the [[intelligent design movement]] such as [[Cornelius G. Hunter]], have asserted that the methodological [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] upon which science is based is religious in nature.&lt;ref&gt;"Science's Blind Spot: The Unseen Religion of Scientific Naturalism". Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; They commonly refer to it as 'scientific materialism' or as 'methodological materialism' and conflate it with 'metaphysical naturalism'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/barbara_forrest/naturalism.html Methodological Naturalism and Philosophical Naturalism]: Clarifying the Connection (2000), [[Barbara Forrest]], Retrieved 2007-05-20.&lt;/ref&gt; They use this assertion to support their claim that modern science is atheistic, and contrast it with their preferred approach of a revived [[natural philosophy]] which welcomes supernatural explanations for natural phenomena and supports [[Theistic realism|theistic science]]. This ignores the distinction between science and religion, established in Ancient Greece, in which science can not use supernatural explanations.&lt;ref name="Pigliucci2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=Massimo |last=Pigliucci |year=2010 |title=Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-66786-7 |lccn=2009049778 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aC8Baky2qTcC&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;pg=PA177 |page=177 |quote=[E]ven back in Aristotle's time, a fundamental assumption of doing things scientifically is that the supernatural is out: no explanations that invoke non-natural causes are allowed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligent design advocate and [[biochemist]] [[Michael Behe]] proposed a development of Paley's watch analogy in which he argued in favour of intelligent design. Unlike Paley, Behe only attempts to prove the existence of an intelligent designer, rather than the God of classical theism. Behe uses the analogy of a mousetrap to propose [[irreducible complexity]]: he argues that if a mousetrap loses just one of its parts, it can no longer function as a mousetrap. He argues that irreducible complexity in an object guarantees the presence of intelligent design. Behe claims that there are instances of irreducible complexity in the natural world and that parts of the world must have been designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Arguing About Gods | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Oppy, Graham | year=2006 | pages=187–189 | isbn=978-0-521-86386-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlVtfUxPD14C&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;vq=188&amp;dq=arguing%20about%20gods&amp;pg=PA187#v=snippet&amp;q=behe&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This negative argument against step by step evolution ignores longstanding evidence that evolution proceeds through [[exaptation|changes of function]] from preceding systems. The specific examples Behe proposes have been shown to have simpler [[Homology (biology)|homologues]] which could act as precursors with different functions. His arguments have been rebutted, both in general and in specific cases by numerous scientific papers{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. In response, Behe and others, "ironically, given the absence of any detail in their own explanation, complain that the proffered explanations lack sufficient detail to be empirically tested."&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt;

==== "Third way" proposal ====

[[University of Chicago]] [[genetics|geneticist]] [[James A. Shapiro]], writing in the [[Boston Review]], states that advancements in genetics and molecular biology, and "the growing realization that cells have molecular computing networks which process information about internal operations and about the external environment to make decisions controlling growth, movement, and differentiation", have implications for the teleological argument. Shapiro states that these "[[natural genetic engineering]]" systems, can produce radical reorganizations of the "genetic apparatus within a single cell generation".&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;Shapiro, James, The Third Way, http://new.bostonreview.net/BR22.1/shapiro.html{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shapiro suggests what he calls a 'Third Way'; a non-creationist, non-Darwinian type of evolution:
{{quote|What significance does an emerging interface between biology and information science hold for thinking about evolution? It opens up the possibility of addressing scientifically rather than ideologically the central issue so hotly contested by fundamentalists on both sides of the Creationist-Darwinist debate: Is there any guiding intelligence at work in the origin of species displaying exquisite adaptations ...&lt;ref name=Shapiro /&gt;}}
In his book, ''Evolution: A View from the 21st Century'', Shapiro refers to this concept of "natural genetic engineering", which he says, has proved troublesome, because many scientists feel that it supports the intelligent design argument. He suggests that "function-oriented capacities [can] be attributed to cells", even though this is "the kind of teleological thinking that scientists have been taught to avoid at all costs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution: A View from the 21st Century|last=Shapiro|first=James|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2011|pages=136–137}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=T7-UgI_kgT8C&amp;dq=shapiro+creationism&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

===Classical===
The original development of the argument from design was in reaction to atomistic, explicitly non-teleological understandings of nature. Socrates, as reported by Plato and Xenophon, was reacting to such natural philosophers. While less has survived from the debates of the Hellenistic and Roman eras, it is clear from sources such as [[Cicero]] and [[Lucretius]], that debate continued for generations, and several of the striking metaphors used to still today such as the unseen watchmaker, and the [[infinite monkey theorem]], have their roots in this period. While the Stoics became the most well-known proponents of the argument from design, the atomistic counter arguments were refined most famously by the [[Epicurus|Epicureans]]. On the one hand, they criticized the evidence for there being evidence of an intelligent design to nature and the logic of the Stoics. On the defensive side, they were faced with the challenge of explaining how un-directed chance can cause something which appears to be a rational order. Much of this defence revolved around arguments such as the infinite monkey metaphor. Democritus had already apparently used such arguments at the time of Socrates, saying that there will be infinite planets, and only some having an order like the planet we know. But the Epicureans refined this argument, by proposing that the actual number of types of atoms in nature is small, not infinite, making it less coincidental that after a long period of time, certain orderly outcomes will result.&lt;ref name=sed/&gt;

These were not the only positions held in classical times. A more complex position also continued to be held by some schools, such as the Neoplatonists, who, like Plato and Aristotle, insisted that Nature did indeed have a rational order, but were concerned about how to describe the way in which this rational order is caused. According to Plotinus for example, Plato's metaphor of a craftsman should be seen only as a metaphor, and Plato should be understood as agreeing with Aristotle that the rational order in nature works through a form of causation unlike everyday causation. In fact, according to this proposal each thing already has its own nature, fitting into a rational order, whereby the thing itself is "in need of, and directed towards, what is higher or better".&lt;ref&gt;Riccardo Chiaradonna, "Plotinus' account of demiurgic causation and its philosophical background", in ''Causation and Creation in Late Antiquity'' edited by Anna Marmodoro, Brian D. Prince, [https://books.google.be/books?id=7Wt2BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31 p.&amp;nbsp;31].&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Hume===
[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|David Hume outlined his criticisms of the teleological argument in his ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''.]]
Louis Loeb writes that [[David Hume]], in his ''Enquiry'', "insists that inductive inference cannot justify belief in extended objects". Loeb also quotes Hume as writing:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is only when two species of objects are found to be constantly conjoined, that we can infer the one from the other ... If experience and observation and analogy be, indeed, the only guides which we can reasonably follow in inference of this nature; both the effect and cause must bear a similarity and resemblance to other effects and causes ... which we have found, in many instances, to be conjoined with another ... [The proponents of the argument] always suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Loeb notes that "we observe neither God nor other universes, and hence no conjunction
involving them. There is no observed conjunction to ground an inference either
to extended objects or to God, as unobserved causes."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ECxW_2tAf0C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=%22insists+that+inductive%22+hume&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cLTzU-nZDYWf7AaRvoCIBw&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22insists%20that%20inductive%22%20hume&amp;f=false Loeb, LE., in Radcliffe, ES (ed.), ''A Companion to Hume'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, p. 118.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Hume also presented a criticism of the argument in his ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''. The character ''Philo'', a religious sceptic, voices Hume's criticisms of the argument. He argues that the design argument is built upon a faulty analogy as, unlike with man-made objects, we have not witnessed the design of a universe, so do not know whether the universe was the result of design. Moreover, the size of the universe makes the analogy problematic: although our experience of the universe is of order, there may be chaos in other parts of the universe.&lt;ref name="IEP Hume"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume | title=David Hume (1711–1776) | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=June 30, 2011 | accessdate=November 24, 2011 | author=Fiesar, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philo argues:
{{Quote|A very small part of this great system, during a very short time, is very imperfectly discovered to us; and do we thence pronounce decisively concerning the origin of the whole?|David Hume|Dialogues 2&lt;ref name="IEP Hume" /&gt;}}
Philo also proposes that the order in nature may be due to nature alone. If nature contains a principle of order within it, the need for a designer is removed. Philo argues that even if the universe is indeed designed, it is unreasonable to justify the conclusion that the designer must be an omnipotent, omniscient, benevolent God – the God of classical theism.&lt;ref name="IEP Hume" /&gt; It is impossible, he argues, to infer the perfect nature of a creator from the nature of its creation. Philo argues that the designer may have been defective or otherwise imperfect, suggesting that the universe may have been a poor first attempt at design.&lt;ref name="God Hypothesis"&gt;{{cite book | title=The God Hypothesis and Other Theories of the Universe | publisher=Infinity Publishing | author=Auerbach, Albert A. | year=2001 | pages=59–60 | isbn=978-0-7414-0245-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OtDSNNPjpRwC&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=teleological%20argument%20from%20ignorance&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=teleological%20argument%20from%20ignorance&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume also pointed out that the argument does not necessarily lead to the existence of one God: “why may not several deities combine in contriving and framing the world?” (p.&amp;nbsp;108).&lt;ref name="Hume1779" /&gt;

[[Wesley C. Salmon]] developed Hume's insights, arguing that all things in the universe which exhibit order are, to our knowledge, created by material, imperfect, finite beings or forces. He also argued that there are no known instances of an immaterial, perfect, infinite being creating anything. Using the probability calculus of [[Bayes Theorem]], Salmon concludes that it is very improbable that the universe was created by the type of intelligent being theists argue for.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley C. Salmon, "Religion and Science: A New Look at Hume's Dialogues", Philosophical Studies, 33 (1978), 143–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] accuses Salmon of [[begging the question]]. One piece of evidence he uses in his probabilistic argument – that atoms and molecules are not caused by design – is equivalent to the conclusion he draws, that the universe is probably not caused by design. The atoms and molecules are what the universe is made up of and whose origins are at issue. Therefore, they cannot be used as evidence against the theistic conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00571885 |jstor=4319204|title=Comments on Wesley Salmon's 'Science and Religion ...'|journal=Philosophical Studies|volume=33|issue=2|pages=177–183|year=1978|last1=Cartwright|first1=Nancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
Referring to it as the physico-theological proof, [[Immanuel Kant]] discussed the teleological argument in his [[Critique of Pure Reason]]. Even though he referred to it as "the oldest, clearest and most appropriate to human reason", he nevertheless rejected it, heading section VI with the words, "On the impossibility of a physico-theological proof".&lt;ref&gt;Buroker, JV., ''Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason': An Introduction'', Cambridge University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;279.[https://books.google.com/books?id=2DaHzDGjR48C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=kant+%22argument+from+design%22+criticism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZS5UU-qhB-nH7AaNsYHwAg&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22argument%20from%20design%22%20&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I, ''Critique of Pure Reason'', in Guyer, P. and Wood, AW.(Trans.), CUP, 1998, p. 578.&lt;/ref&gt; In accepting some of Hume's criticisms, Kant wrote that the argument "proves at most intelligence only in the arrangement of the 'matter' of the universe, and hence the existence not of a 'Supreme Being', but of an 'Architect{{'"}}. Using the argument to try to prove the existence of God required "a concealed appeal to the [[Ontological argument]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rabitte, E., in Tweyman, S, (ed.), ''David Hume: Critical Assessments'', Volume 5, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1995, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Does not prove the existence of God ===
[[File:D'après Nicolas de Largillière, portrait de Voltaire (Institut et Musée Voltaire) -001.jpg|thumb|[[Voltaire]] argued that, at best, the teleological argument could only indicate the existence of a powerful, but not necessarily all-powerful or all-knowing, intelligence.]]

In his ''Traité de métaphysique'' [[Voltaire]] argued that, even if the argument from design could prove the existence of a powerful intelligent designer, it would not prove that this designer is God.&lt;ref name=Voltaire&gt;{{cite book | author = Voltaire | authorlink = Voltaire | others = trans.

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] questioned the existence of God, rejecting all rational arguments for God's existence (including the teleological argument) on the grounds that reason is inevitably accompanied by doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Words of Wisdom: Philosophy's Most Important Quotations And Their Meanings | publisher=Quercus | author=Southwell, Gareth | isbn=978-1-78087-092-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9JWTes9fH0C&amp;lpg=PT325&amp;dq=S%C3%B8ren%20Kierkegaard%20%22teleological%20argument%22&amp;pg=PT325#v=onepage&amp;q=S%C3%B8ren%20Kierkegaard%20%22teleological%20argument%22&amp;f=false | date=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that the argument from design does not take into consideration future events which may serve to undermine the proof of God's existence: the argument would never finish proving God's existence.&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard"&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Philosophical Fragments'' (1844).&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'', Kierkegaard writes:

{{Quotation|The works of God are such that only God can perform them. Just so, but where then are the works of the God? The works from which I would deduce his existence are not directly and immediately given. The wisdom in nature, the goodness, the wisdom in the governance of the world – are all these manifest, perhaps, upon the very face of things? Are we not here confronted with the most terrible temptations to doubt, and is it not impossible finally to dispose of all these doubts? But from such an order of things I will surely not attempt to prove God's existence; and even if I began I would never finish, and would in addition have to live constantly in suspense, lest something so terrible should suddenly happen that my bit of proof would be demolished.|Søren Kierkegaard|Philosophical Fragments&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard" /&gt;}}

=== Argument from improbability ===
[[Richard Dawkins]] is harshly critical of intelligent design in his book ''[[The God Delusion]].'' In this book, he contends that an appeal to intelligent design can provide no explanation for biology because it not only [[begs the question]] of the designer's own origin but raises additional questions: an intelligent designer must itself be far more complex and difficult to explain than anything it is capable of designing.&lt;ref name="dawkins2006"/&gt; He believes the chances of life arising on a planet like the Earth are many orders of magnitude less probable than most people would think, but the [[anthropic principle]] effectively counters skepticism with regard to improbability. For example Astronomer [[Fred Hoyle#Rejection of chemical evolution|Fred Hoyle]] suggested that potential for life on Earth was no more probable than a [[Boeing 747]] being assembled by a hurricane from the scrapyard. Dawkins argues that a one-time event is indeed subject to improbability but once under way, natural selection itself is nothing like random chance. Furthermore, he refers to his counter argument to the argument from improbability by that same name:&lt;ref name="dawkins2006"/&gt;

{{quotation|The argument from improbability is the big one. In the traditional guise of the argument from design, it is easily today's most popular argument offered in favour of the existence of God and it is seen, by an amazingly large number of theists, as completely and utterly convincing. It is indeed a very strong and, I suspect, unanswerable argument—but in precisely the opposite direction from the theist's intention. The argument from improbability, properly deployed, comes close to proving that God does ''not'' exist. My name for the statistical demonstration that God almost certainly does not exist is the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit.

The creationist misappropriation of the argument from improbability always takes the same general form, and it doesn't make any difference ... [if called] 'intelligent design' (ID). Some observed phenomenon—often a living creature or one of its more complex organs, but it could be anything from a molecule up to the universe itself—is correctly extolled as statistically improbable. Sometimes the language of information theory is used: the Darwinian is challenged to explain the source all the information in living matter, in the technical sense of information content as a measure of improbability or 'surprise value'… However statistically improbable the entity you seek to explain by invoking a designer, the designer himself has got to be at least as improbable. God is the Ultimate Boeing 747.

... The whole argument turns on the familiar question 'Who made God?'... A designer God cannot be used to explain organized complexity because any God capable of designing anything would have to be complex enough to demand the same kind of explanation in his own right. God presents an infinite regress from which he cannot help us to escape. This argument… demonstrates that God, though not technically disprovable, is very very improbable indeed.&lt;ref name="dawkins2006"/&gt;|Richard Dawkins|The God Delusion}}

Dawkins considered the argument from improbability to be "much more powerful" than the teleological argument, or argument from design, although he sometimes implies the terms are used interchangeably. He paraphrases St. Thomas' teleological argument as follows: "Things in the world, especially living things, look as though they have been designed. Nothing that we know looks designed unless it is designed. Therefore there must have been a designer, and we call him God."&lt;ref name="dawkins2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |year=2006 |title=The God Delusion |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |isbn=978-0-618-68000-9 |lccn=2006015506 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;pg=PA103 |pages=103, 136–138, 162–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Edward Feser]] has accused Dawkins of misunderstanding the teleological argument, particularly Aquinas' version.&lt;ref&gt;Feser, Edward, ''The Last Superstition'', St. Augustine Press 2008, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aei.org/publication/the-new-philistinism/ | title=The New Philistinism| date=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A flawed argument===
[[George H. Smith]], in his book ''Atheism: The Case Against God'', points out what he considers to be a flaw in the argument from design:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now consider the idea that nature itself is the product of design. How could this be demonstrated? Nature… provides the basis of comparison by which we distinguish between designed objects and natural objects. We are able to infer the presence of design only to the extent that the characteristics of an object differ from natural characteristics. Therefore, to claim that nature as a whole was designed is to destroy the basis by which we differentiate between artifacts and natural objects.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, GH., ''Atheism: The Case Against God'', Prometheus Books, 2003, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Perception of purpose in biology ===
{{main|Teleology in biology}}

The [[philosophy of biology|philosopher of biology]] [[Michael Ruse]] has argued that Darwin treated the structure of organisms as if they had a purpose: "the organism-as-if-it-were-designed-by God picture was absolutely central to Darwin's thinking in 1862, as it always had been."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Darwin and Design: Does Evolution Have a Purpose? | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Ruse, Michael | year=2003 | pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to this as "the metaphor of design ... Organisms give the appearance of being designed, and thanks to Charles Darwin's discovery of natural selection we know why this is true." In his review of Ruse's book, R.J. Richards writes, "Biologists quite routinely refer to the design of organisms and their traits, but properly speaking it's ''apparent'' design to which they refer – an 'as if' design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~rjr6/articles/Richards%20on%20Ruse.pdf | title=Michael Ruse's Design for Living | author=Richards, Robert J. | journal=Journal of the History of Biology | year=2004 | volume=37 | pages=25–38 | doi=10.1023/b:hist.0000020388.99933.5b}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Foley (academic)|Robert Foley]] refers to this as "the illusion of purpose, design, and progress". He adds, "there is no purpose in a fundamentally causative manner in evolution but that the processes of selection and adaptation give the illusion of purpose through the utter functionality and designed nature of the biological world."&lt;ref&gt;Foley, RA., in Morris, SC., ''The Deep Structure of Biology: Is Convergence Sufficiently Ubiquitous to Give a Directional Signal'', Templeton Foundation Press, 2008 p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Dawkins suggests that while biology can at first seem to be purposeful and ordered, upon closer inspection its true function becomes questionable. Dawkins rejects the claim that biology serves any designed function, claiming rather that biology only mimics such purpose. In his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', Dawkins states that animals are the most complex things in the known universe: "Biology is the study of complicated things that give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose." He argues that natural selection should suffice as an explanation of biological complexity without recourse to divine provenance.&lt;ref name="Dawkins1986"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |year=1986 |title=The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-31570-7 |lccn=96229669 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C&amp;pg=PA1 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, theologian [[Alister McGrath]] has pointed out that the fine-tuning of carbon is even responsible for nature's ability to tune itself to any degree.&lt;blockquote&gt;[The entire biological] evolutionary process depends upon the unusual chemistry of carbon, which allows it to bond to itself, as well as other elements, creating highly complex molecules that are stable over prevailing terrestrial temperatures, and are capable of conveying genetic information (especially DNA). ... Whereas it might be argued that nature creates its own fine-tuning, this can only be done if the primordial constituents of the universe are such that an evolutionary process can be initiated. The unique chemistry of carbon is the ultimate foundation of the capacity of nature to tune itself.&lt;ref name="biologos.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGrath|first1=Alister E.|title=A fine-tuned universe: the quest for God in science and theology|date=2009|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, KY.|isbn=978-0664233105|page=176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proponents of [[intelligent design]] creationism, such as [[William A. Dembski]] question the philosophical assumptions made by critics with regard to what a designer would or would not do. Dembski claims that such arguments are not merely beyond the purview of science: often they are tacitly or overtly theological while failing to provide a serious analysis of the hypothetical objective's relative merit. Some critics, such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] suggest that any purported 'cosmic' designer would only produce optimal designs, while there are numerous biological criticisms to demonstrate that such an ideal is manifestly untenable. Against these ideas, Dembski characterizes both Dawkins' and Gould's argument as a rhetorical [[straw man]].&lt;ref name="Dembski2004"/&gt; He suggests a principle of [[constrained optimization]] more realistically describes the best any designer could hope to achieve:

{{quotation|Not knowing the objectives of the designer, Gould was in no position to say whether the designer proposed a faulty compromise among those objectives… In criticizing design, biologists tend to place a premium on functionalities of individual organisms and see design as optimal to the degree that those individual functionalities are maximized. But higher-order designs of entire ecosystems might require lower-order designs of individual organisms to fall short of maximal function.&lt;ref name="Dembski2004"&gt;{{cite book |first=William A. |last=Dembski |year=2004 |title=The Design Revolution: Answering the Toughest Questions About Intelligent Design |publisher=InterVarsity Press |isbn=978-0-8308-3216-3 |lccn=2003020589 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKVqpXqE0VwC&amp;pg=PA58 |pages=58–59, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;|William A. Dembski|[[The Design Revolution]]: Answering the Toughest Questions About Intelligent Design}}

===Fideism===
[[Fideism|Fideists]] may reject attempts to prove God's existence. For example, Calvinist theologian [[Karl Barth]] held that God can be known only through Jesus Christ, as revealed in scripture[https://www.hoddereducation.co.uk/media/Documents/RS/1-3_Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God_The_cosmological_argument.pdf], and that any such attempts should be considered idolotry.

=== Other criticisms ===
The teleological argument assumes that one can infer the existence of intelligent design merely by examination, and because life is reminiscent of something a human might design, it too must have been designed. However, considering "snowflakes and crystals of certain salts", "[i]n no case do we find intelligence". "There are other ways that order and design can come about" such as by "purely physical forces".&lt;ref&gt;Cornman, JW, Lehrer, K, Pappas, GS, ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Philosophical_Problems_and_Arguments.html?id=cRHegYZgyfUC Philosophical Problems and Arguments: An Introduction]'', Hackett Publishing, 1992, pp. 245–256.&lt;/ref&gt;

The design claim can be challenged as an [[argument from analogy]]. Supporters of design suggest that natural objects and man-made objects have many similar properties, and man-made objects have a designer. Therefore, it is probable that natural objects must be designed as well. However, proponents must demonstrate that all the available evidence has been taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;Cornman, JW, Lehrer, K, Pappas, GS, ''Philosophical Problems and Arguments: An Introduction'', Hackett Publishing, 1992, p. 239.
https://books.google.com/books/about/Philosophical_Problems_and_Arguments.html?id=cRHegYZgyfUC
&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Rust argues that, when speaking of familiar objects such as watches, "we have a basis to make an inference from such an object to its designer". However, the "universe is a unique and isolated case" and we have nothing to compare it with, so "we have no basis for making an inference such as we can with individual objects. ... We have no basis for applying to the whole universe what may hold of constituent elements in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Rust, E., ''Religion, Revelation and Reason'', Mercer University Press, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AcSw6GDlLVwC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=criticism+%22teleological+argument%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nUBRU9_IJMfxPOvkgNgN&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=criticism%20%22teleological%20argument%22&amp;f=false 96].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most professional biologists [[Level of support for evolution#Scientific support|support]] the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]], not merely as an alternative explanation for the complexity of life but a better explanation with more supporting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interacademies.net/10878/13901.aspx IAP Statement on the Teaching of Evolution] Joint statement issued by the national science academies of 67 countries, including the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Society]] (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt; Living organisms obey the same physical laws as inanimate objects. Over [[Geologic time scale|very long periods of time]] self-replicating structures arose and later formed [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, PJ., ''Biology: The Dynamic Science, Volume 1'', 2008, Cengage Learning, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar discussions in other civilizations==

===Hinduism===
[[Nyaya]], the Hindu school of logic, had a version of the argument from design. P.G. Patil writes that, in this view, it is not the complexity of the world from which one can infer the existence of a creator, but the fact that "the world is made up of parts". In this context, it is the Supreme Soul, [[Ishvara]], who created all the world.

The argument is in five parts:
# The ... world ... has been constructed by an intelligent agent.
# On account of being an effect.
# Each and every effect has been constructed by an intelligent agent, just like a pot.
# And the world is an effect.
# Therefore, it has been constructed by an intelligent agent.&lt;ref&gt;Patil, PG., ''Against a Hindu God: Buddhist Philosophy of Religion in India'', Columbia University Press, 2013, Chapter 2.[https://books.google.com/books?id=z88GAfvNGH0C&amp;pg=PT65&amp;dq=buddhism+%22argument+from+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uTNVU8_fJcHT7Aa4hYGACw&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhism%20%22argument%20from%20design%22&amp;f=false] In a note, the author says that the Nyaya argument has been called a "cosmo-teleological argument".&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other Hindu schools, such as [[Samkhya]], deny that the existence of God can ever be proved, because such a creator can never be perceived. [[Krishna Mohan Banerjee]], in his ''Dialogues on the Hindu Philosophy'', has the Samkhya speaker saying, "the existence of God cannot be established because there is no proof. ... nor can it be proved by Inference, because you cannot exhibit an analogous instance."&lt;ref&gt;Banerjea, KM., ''Dialogues on the Hindu Philosophy Comprising the Nyaya, the Sankhya, the Vedanta'', Thacker Spink, 1861, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist criticism of Hindu Nyaya logic===
[[Buddhism]] denies the existence of a creator god, and rejects the Nyaya syllogism for the teleological argument as being "logically flawed". Buddhists argue that "the 'creation' of the world cannot be shown to be analogous to the creation of a human artifact, such as a pot."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, RR., ''Is Enlightenment Possible?: Dharmakīrti and RGyal Tshab Rje on Knowledge, Rebirth, No-self and Liberation'', Snow Lion Publications, 1993, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucianism===
The 18th century German philosopher [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] once thought that [[Confucius]] was a godless man, and that "the ancient Chinese had no natural religion, since they did not know the creator of the world". However, later, Wolff changed his mind to some extent. "On Wolff's reading, Confucius's religious perspective is thus more or less the weak deistic one of Hume's Cleanthes".&lt;ref&gt;Van Norden, BW., ''Confucius and the Analects'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
The Taoist writings of the 6th century BC philosopher [[Laozi]], also known as Lao Tzu, have similarities with modern naturalist science. B. Schwartz notes that, in [[Taoism]], "The processes of nature are not guided by a teleological consciousness ... the tao [dao] is not consciously providential.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B., Quoted in Lai, K., ''An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Role of the Church in the Causation, Treatment and Prevention of the Crisis in the Priesthood''''', a report submitted to the [[General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops]] in [[Rome]] in 1971, by Dr [[Conrad Baars]], a Dutch-born Catholic psychiatrist from [[Minnesota]], and based on a study of 1500 priests, suggested that seminary training left priests poorly prepared for a lifetime of [[celibacy]].

==Description==
This report was published by Franciscan Herald Press in 1972 as '''''How to Treat and Prevent the Crisis in the Priesthood'''''. It was also expected to be published in 2006 by St. Paul's/Alba House as part of a book of essays on the priesthood and religious life.

#"psychosexual immaturity expressed in heterosexual or homosexual activity was encountered often. Virtually all of these priests were . . . suffering from a severe to moderate frustration neurosis”.
#Less than 15% of priests in Europe and North America were emotionally fully developed;
#Of the remaining 85%, 20–25% had "serious psychiatric difficulties" that they expressed through alcohol abuse, while 60–70% had less severe degrees of emotional immaturity.

Though the report suggested that immediate corrective action was needed, making ten recommendations, and one of those most active in the Synod was Cardinal Wojtyła, who on October 16, 1978 was elected [[Pope John Paul II]], no implementation of the report's detailed recommendations followed.

[[File:Tong2ji1.jpg|thumb|[[Chinese characters]] for ''tongji'']]
'''Tongji''' ({{zh|c=童乩|p=''tóngjī''|w=''t'ung-chi''|l=youth diviner}}; [[Taiwanese Romanization System|Tâi-lô]]: tâng-ki) or '''Jitong''' ({{zh|c=乩童|p=''jītóng''|w=''chi-t'ung''|l=divining youth}}) is a [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese folk]] religious specialist, usually translated as a "[[spirit medium]]", "[[oracle]]", or "[[shaman]]".

This word compounds ''tong'' [[Wikt:童|童]] "child; youth; boy servant" and ''ji'' [[Wikt:乩|乩]] "to divine" (cf. ''[[Fuji (planchette writing)|fuji]]'' 扶乩 "divination; planchette writing"). Regional variants include [[Hokkien]] ''tâng-ki'' 童乩 and [[Canton dialect|Cantonese]] ''gei-tung'' 乩童 or ''san-daa'' 神打.  

A ''tongji'' or ''jitong'' is a person believed to have been chosen by a particular ''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' 神 "god; spirit" as the earthly vehicle for divine expression. The Chinese differentiate a ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]''  巫 "shaman; healer; spirit medium" who gains control of forces in the spirit world versus a ''tongji'' who appears to be entirely under the control of forces in the spirit world.

Frequently a person who will become a ''tongji'' to experiences a feeling of compulsion of something that will possess them. The person may attempt to resist that compulsion, but should their resistance fail, they will enter into a [[altered state of consciousness|trance]] in which they  may beat themselves with a nail-studded ball at the end of a cord and handle to the point that he draws blood from multiple wounds on his back. While in this trance state the ''tongji'' is believed to be possessed by a ''shen''.

[[File:Speculum 74v.jpg|thumb|The [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]] from a ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'' c. 1430, see below.]]
'''Typology'''  in [[Christian theology]] and Biblical [[exegesis]] is a doctrine or theory concerning the [[Old Testament#Relationship between Old and New Testament|relationship of the Old Testament to the New Testament]].   Events, persons, or statements in the [[Old Testament]] are seen as '''types''' pre-figuring or superseded by '''antitypes''', events or aspects of [[Christ (title)|Christ]] or his revelation described in the [[New Testament]]. For example, [[Jonah]] may be seen as the '''type''' of Christ in that he emerged from the fish's belly and thus appeared to rise from death.  In the fullest version of the theory of typology, the whole purpose of the Old Testament is viewed as merely the provision of types for Christ, the antitype or fulfillment. The theory began in the [[Early Church]], was at its most influential in the [[High Middle Ages]], and continued to be popular, especially in [[Calvinism]], after the [[Protestant Reformation]], but in subsequent periods has been given less emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/126-a-study-of-biblical-typology A Study of Biblical Typology] (Wayne Jackson, ''Christian Courier'')&lt;/ref&gt; One exception to this is the [[Christian Brethren]] of the 19th and 20th centuries, where typology was much favoured and the subject of numerous books. Notably, in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], typology is still a common and frequent exegetical tool, mainly due to that church's great emphasis on continuity in doctrinal presentation through all historical periods. Typology was frequently used in early Christian art, where type and antitype would be depicted in contrasting positions. The usage of the terminology has expanded into the secular sphere; for example, "[[Geoffrey de Montbray]] (d.1093), [[Bishop of Coutances]], a right-hand man of [[William the Conqueror]], was a type of the great [[feudal]] prelate, warrior and administrator".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term is derived from the Greek noun τύπος (''typos''), "a blow, hitting, stamp", and thus the figure or impression made on a coin by such action; that is, an image, figure, or statue of a man; also an original pattern, model, or mould. To this is prefixed the Greek preposition ἀντί ''anti'', meaning opposite, corresponding.&lt;ref&gt;''Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon'', Oxford 1871.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Latin ''figura'', meaning form, shape, or figure, may be comparable, but is from the less violent verb ''fingo, finxi, fictum'', to fashion, form, or mould (Cassell's Latin Dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the theory==
Christian typology begins in the New Testament itself. For example, [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 5.14 calls [[Adam]] "a type [τύπος] of the one who was to come" — i.e., a type of [[Jesus of Nazareth|Christ]]. He contrasts Adam and Christ both in Romans 5 and in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 15. The author of the [[First Epistle of Peter]] uses the term ἀντίτυπον (''antitypon'') to refer to baptism&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Peter|3:21|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are also typological concepts in pre-Pauline strata of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;E. Earle Ellis, 1957, ''Paul’s Use of the Old Testament''. Edinburgh; London: Oliver and Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Christians, in considering the Old Testament, needed to decide what its role and purpose was for them, given that Christian revelation and the [[New Covenant]] might be considered to have [[Supersessionism|superseded]] it, and many specific Old Testament rules and requirements were no longer being followed from books such as  [[Leviticus]] dealing with [[Expounding of the Law]].&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Leviticus 18]]&lt;/ref&gt;  One purpose of the Old Testament for Christians was to demonstrate that the [[Ministry of Jesus]] and Christ's first coming had been prophesied and foreseen, and the [[Gospel]]s indeed contain many [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy|Old Testament prophecies fulfilled by Christ]] and [[Quotations from the Old Testament in the New Testament|quotations from the Old Testament]] which explicitly and implicitly link Jesus to Old Testament prophecies. Typology greatly extended the number of these links by adding others based on the similarity of Old Testament actions or situations to an aspect of Christ.

Typology is also a theory of [[history]], seeing the whole story of the Jewish and Christian peoples as shaped by God, with events within the story acting as symbols for later events. In this role, God is often compared to a writer, using actual events instead of fiction to shape his narrative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/TYPE.HTM Typology] Washington State University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of typology==
{{Refimprove|date=April 2016}}
The system of [[Medieval allegory]] began in the Early Church as a method for synthesizing the seeming discontinuities between the [[Hebrew Bible]] (Old Testament) and the New Testament. The Church studied both testaments and saw each as equally [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] by [[God]], yet the Old Testament contained discontinuities for Christians such as the Jewish [[kosher]] laws and [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|the requirement for male circumcision]].  This therefore encouraged seeing at least parts of the Old Testament not as a literal account but as an [[allegory]] or foreshadowing of the events of the New Testament, and in particular examining how the events of the Old Testament related to the events of Christ's life.  Most theorists believed in the literal truth of the Old Testament accounts, but regarded the events described as shaped by God to provide types foreshadowing Christ. Others regarded some parts of the Bible as essentially allegorical; however, the typological relationships remained the same whichever view was taken.  [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] states the doctrine in [[Colossians]] 2:16-17 - "Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a [[Biblical sabbath|sabbath day]]. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ." The idea also finds expression in the [[Letter to the Hebrews]].

The development of this systematic view of the [[Hebrew Bible]] was influenced by the thought of the [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic Jewish]] world centered in [[Alexandria]], where Jewish philosopher [[Philo]] (c. 20 BC – c. 50 AD) and others viewed Scripture in philosophical terms (contemporary Greek literary theory highlighted [[foreshadowing]] as a literary device) as essentially an allegory, using Hellenistic [[Platonism|Platonic]] concepts. [[Origen]] (184/185{{snd}}253/254) Christianised the system, and figures including [[Hilary of Poitiers]] (c. 300{{snd}}c. 368) and [[Ambrose]] (c. 340{{snd}}397) spread it.  [[Saint Augustine]] (345–430) recalled often hearing Ambrose say that "the letter kills but the spirit gives life", and Augustine in turn became a hugely influential proponent of the system, though also insisting on the literal historical truth of the Bible. [[Isidore of Seville]] (c. 560-636) and [[Rabanus Maurus]] (c. 780-856) became influential as summarizers and compilers of works setting out standardized interpretations of correspondences and their meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Male, ''The Gothic Image, Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century'', p 131-9, English translation of 3rd edition, 1913, Collins, London, {{ISBN|978-0064300322}} (and many other editions)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish typological thought continued to develop in [[Rabbinic literature]], including the [[Kabbalah]], with concepts such as the [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Pardes]], the four approaches to a Biblical text.

[[File:Speculum75R.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacob's Ladder]] from a ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'' c. 1430, pre-figuring the Ascension above]]

Typology frequently emerged in art; many typological pairings appear in sculpture on cathedrals and churches and in other media.  Popular illustrated works expounding typological couplings were among the commonest books of the late Middle Ages, as [[illuminated manuscripts]], [[blockbooks]], and [[incunabula]] (early printed books).  The ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'' and the ''[[Biblia pauperum]]'' became the two most successful compilations.

===Example of Jonah===
The story of [[Jonah]] and the fish in the Old Testament offers an example of typology. In the Old Testament [[Book of Jonah]], Jonah told his shipmates to throw him overboard, explaining that God's wrath would pass if Jonah were sacrificed, and that the sea would become calm. Jonah then spent three days and three nights in the belly of a great fish before it spat him up onto dry land.

Typological interpretation of this story holds that it prefigures Christ's burial and resurrection. The stomach of the fish represented Christ's tomb; as Jonah exited from the fish after three days and three nights, so did Christ rise from His tomb on the third day.  In the New Testament, Jesus invokes Jonah in the manner of a type: "As the crowds increased, Jesus said, 'This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.'" {{bibleverse||Luke|11:29–32}} (see also {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:38–42}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|16:1–4}}). In {{bibleverse|Jonah|2|HE}}, Jonah called the belly of the fish "[[Sheol|She'ol]]", the land of the dead (translated as "the grave" in the [[New International Version|NIV]] Bible).

Thus, when one finds an allusion to Jonah in [[Medieval art]] or in [[Medieval literature]], it usually represents an allegory for the burial and resurrection of Christ. Other common typological allegories entail the four major Old Testament prophets [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]], and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] prefiguring the four Evangelists [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], and [[John the Evangelist|John]], or the twelve tribes of Israel foreshadowing the twelve [[apostles]]. Commentators could find countless numbers of analogies between stories of the Old Testament and the New; modern typologists prefer to limit themselves to considering typological relationships that they find sanctioned in the New Testament itself, as in the example of Jonah above.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, see above&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Old Testament examples==
[[File:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|right|Christians believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;for example {{bible verse||Hebrews|8:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Sermon on the Mount]] he [[Expounding of the Law|commented on the Law]]. Some scholars [[Expounding of the Law#Antithesis of the Law|consider this]] to be an '''antitype''' of the proclamation of the [[Ten Commandments]] or [[Mosaic Covenant]] by [[Moses]] from [[Biblical Mount Sinai|mount Sinai]].]]

===Offering of Isaac===
Genesis Chapter 22 brings us the story of the preempted offering of Isaac. God asks Abraham to offer his son Isaac to Him, cited as foreshadowing the crucifixion of Jesus. Isaac asks his father, “Where is the lamb for the burnt offering”, and Abraham prophesies, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And indeed, a ram caught by its horns awaits them, which is also seen as a type for Christ, the [[Lamb of God|lamb that God provides]] for sacrifice, [[Crown of Thorns|crowned by thorns]].

===Joseph===
Genesis Chapters 37-50 has the story of Joseph in Egypt, and Joseph is commonly cited as a Christ type.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnthebible.org/L-023_joseph_sold_into_slavery.htm Learn the bible site]&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph is a very special son to his father. From his father’s perspective, Joseph dies and then comes back to life as the ruler of Egypt. Joseph’s brothers deceive their father by dipping his coat in the blood of a sacrificed goat (Genesis 37:31).  Later, Joseph’s father finds that Joseph is alive and is the ruler of Egypt who saves the world from a great famine. Other parallels between Joseph and Jesus include:
* both are rejected by their own people
* both became servants
* both are betrayed for silver
* both are falsely accused and face false witnesses
* both attain stations at the "right hand" of the respective thrones (Joseph at Pharaoh's throne and Christ at the throne of God)
*Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh, and Jesus was about the same age according to the bible when he began his ministry 
*Money and goods were not able to save the people in time of famine, they had to sell themselves, the same notions are discussed throughout the new testment.  
* both provided for the salvation of gentiles,  (Joseph provided a physical salvation in preparing for the famine, while Christ provided the deeper spiritual salvation)
* Joseph married an Egyptian wife, bringing her into the Abrahamic lineage; Christ's relationship with the church is also described in marriage terms in the New Testament
*A direct parallel with Joseph ruling over all of Egypt, and that only Pharaoh would greater in the throne is repeated in 1 Corinthians 15:27 with regards to Jesus 
*Both suffered greatly, and through patience and humbleness were exalted greatly by God, who gave in abundance all things over time.

===Moses===
Moses, like Joseph and Jonah, undergoes a symbolic death and resurrection. Moses is placed in a basket and floated down the Nile river, and then is drawn out of the Nile to be adopted as a prince (floating the body down the Nile river was also part of an [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|Egyptian funerary ritual]] for royalty).&lt;ref&gt;Burial customs [http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/egypt/giza/boat/boat.html] [http://www.carnegiemnh.org/exhibits/egypt/guide.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the wilderness, [[Moses]] put a brazen serpent on a pole which would heal anyone bitten by a snake, provided that the person looked at it (Numbers 21:8). Jesus proclaimed that the serpent was a type of Himself: "as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up" (John 3:14).

In a battle with the Amalekites, [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 17:11 states that "as long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning." Commentators{{citation needed|reason=Such as?|date=April 2016}} interpret Moses' raised hands as a type of Jesus' raised hands upon the Cross for, when Jesus' hands were raised as He died, a figurative battle was waged with sin, the end result being victory - that "all will be made alive" (1 Cor. 15:22).

===Inanimate types===
Other types were found in aspects of the Old Testament less tied to specific events.  The [[Jewish holiday]]s also have typological fulfillment in the life of Christ.  The [[Last Supper]] was a [[Passover]] meal.  Furthermore, many people{{citation needed|reason=Such as?|date=April 2016}} see the Spring Feasts as types of what Christ accomplished in his first advent and the Fall Feasts as types of what Christ will accomplish in his second advent.

The Jewish [[Tabernacle]] is commonly seen as a series of complex types of [[Jesus Christ]]. For example, Jesus describes himself as "the door"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:9;&amp;version=9; John 10:9]&lt;/ref&gt; and the only "way" to God,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2014:6;&amp;version=9; John14:6]&lt;/ref&gt; represented in the single, wide gate to the tabernacle court; the various layers of coverings over the tabernacle represent Christ's godliness (in the intricately woven inner covering) and his humanity (in the dull colouring of the outside covering).&lt;ref&gt;CH Raven, ''God's Sanctuary'', John Ritchie Ltd., 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-946351-31-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Showbread]] prepared in the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] is also seen as a type for Christ.{{citation needed|reason=Such as?|date=April 2016}}

==Post-biblical usage==
As [[Erich Auerbach]] points out in his essay "Figura", typological (figural) interpretation co-existed alongside allegorical and symbolic-mythical forms of interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, Erich. "Figura". pp.54-57.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was typology that was most influential as Christianity spread in late Mediterranean cultures, as well as in the North and Western European cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach p.58&lt;/ref&gt; Auerbach notes that it was the predominant method of understanding the Hebrew scriptures until after the Reformation—that is, that the Hebrew texts were ''not'' understood as Jewish history and law but were instead interpreted "as ''figura rerum'' or phenomenal prophecy, as a prefiguration of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Typological interpretation was a key element of Medieval realism, but remained important in Europe "up to the eighteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, typology was extended beyond interpretations of the Hebrew scriptures and applied to post-Biblical events, seeing them as "not the ultimate fulfillment, but [...] a promise of the end of time and the true kingdom of God."&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Puritans interpreted their own history typologically:&lt;ref&gt;See for instance, [[Sacvan Bercovitch]], ''Typology and Early American Literature'', U Mass Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Applied more liberally and figured more broadly, typology expanded into a more elaborate verbal system that enabled an interpreter to discover biblical forecasts of current events.  Thus, the Atlantic journey of the Puritans could be an antitype of the Exodus of the Israelites; and the New England colony, a New Zion, to which Christ may return to usher in the Millennium.  The first settlers were conservative, cautious typologists, but as Edward Johnson's Wonder-Working Providence of Sion's Saviour in New England (1654; composed c. 1650) demonstrates, by the 1640s New England's sacred errand into the wilderness and the approaching Apocalypse were accepted antitypes of sacred history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emory Elliott]], "New England Puritan Literature" p.188 at [http://www.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/typology.htm Donna Campbell's American Literature site at WSU]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In this way, the Puritans applied typology both to themselves as a group and to the progress of the individual souls: {{cquote|Applied more broadly, typology enabled Puritans to read biblical types as forecasting not just the events of the New Testament but also their own historical situation and experiences. In this way, individual Puritans could make sense of their own spiritual struggles and achievements by identifying with biblical personages like Adam, Noah, or Job. But this broad understanding of typology was not restricted to individual typing; the Puritans also interpreted their group identity as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, identifying their community as the "New Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learner.org/amerpass/unit03/glossary.html American Passages Unit 3 Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Typology also became important as a literary device, in which both historical and literary characters become prefigurations of later historical or literary characters.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach's essay treats of figuration in [[Dante]]. For a collection of essays on this topic, see [[Earl Miner]], ''Literary Uses of Typology from the Late Middle Ages to the Present'', Princeton U Press, 1977. Of especial interest in this volume are Robert Hollander's essay "Typology and Secular Literature: Some Medieval Problems and Examples" (pp.3-19) and [[Barbara Kiefer Lewalski]]'s "Typological Symbolism and the 'Progress of the Soul' in Seventeenth-Century Literature" (pp.79-114).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8831">'''Unit cohesion in the United States military''' it has been the subject of dispute and political debate since World War II as the United States military has expanded the categories of citizens it accepts as servicemembers. [[Unit cohesion]] is a [[military]] concept, defined by one former [[United States]] [[Chief of staff]] in the early 1980s as "the bonding together of soldiers in such a way as to sustain their will and commitment to each other, the unit, and mission accomplishment, despite combat or mission stress".&lt;ref name=manning&gt;"Morale and Cohesion in Military Psychiatry, Fred Manning, [http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/military_psychiatry/MPch1.pdf p.4] in ''Military Psychiatry: Preparing in Peace for War'', {{ISBN|0160591325}}; Manning cites Meyer, EC, "The unit", ''Defense'', 1982;82(February):1-9
&lt;/ref&gt; The concept lacks a consensus definition among military analysts, [[sociologist]]s, and [[psychologist]]s.&lt;ref name=palmer&gt;Brian Palmer (2010), [http://www.slate.com/id/2276469/ "Pentagon Sees Little Risk in Allowing Gay Men and Women to Serve Openly"] ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', Dec. 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
==Factors affecting unit cohesion==
{{harvnb|Henning|2009|pp=1-16}} has identified some factors in unit cohesion: 
*the units (squad, platoon, or company level) are small enough that key NCOs (E5-E9) can influence others,&lt;ref name=Henning2009/&gt;{{rp|11}} 
*the Unit Manning System emphasizes the stability of units and their families at the brigade level, as structured in Army Force Generation [[ARFORGEN]], rather than the Individual Replacement System in use since before the Vietnam era&lt;ref name=Henning2009/&gt;{{rp|8}} 
*in the WWII and Korean War eras, once a soldier was wounded or separated from his unit, there was little chance of returning to his unit&lt;ref name=Henning2009/&gt;{{rp|8}}  and 
*the Stop Loss pay provision of $500 per month was instituted to encourage personnel to remain with their units during combat deployments.&lt;ref name=Henning2009&gt;{{harvnb|Henning|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6-12}}

==Race==
Prior to US [[Executive Order 9981]], issued on July 26, 1948 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], the [[United States Armed Forces|American military]] was [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]]. Opponents of [[racial integration]] frequently alleged that integrating the armed forces would have detrimental effects on unit cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vnnJYQ4FYasC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Sexual orientation and U.S. military personnel policy: options and assessment]. National Defense Research Institute (U.S.), United States. Dept. of Defense. Page 171, 'Racial Integration, Unit Cohesion, and Military Effectiveness.'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in combat==
Brian Mitchell, in his article "Women Make Poor Soldiers" (excerpted from his 1989 book "''Weak Link: The Feminization of the American Military''"), expressed concern that placing [[Women in the military#Tactical concerns|women in combat]] lowers unit cohesion, either due to [[sexual relationship]]s taking priority over group loyalty, or because men would feel obliged to be more protective of women than other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=According to Mitchell (1991), when women and men work under stressful conditions in close quarters, sexual liaisons may become likely. These liaisons may threaten the stability of military families, disrupt discipline, and distract personnel from the mission.|url=http://www1.appstate.edu/orgs/acjournal/holdings/vol2/Iss1/essays/rooks.html|title=Looking at G.I. Jane through Lenses of Gender |first=Sheri Crowley|last=Rooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell's view was harshly criticized in a [[New York Times]] review, which stated the book was "spoiled by intemperate allegations and a supercilious tone" and lacked sourcing for statements.&lt;ref name=NYTMitchell&gt;{{cite news|last=Halloran|first=Richard|title=FIGHTING WOMEN|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/03/books/fighting-women.html|accessdate=13 May 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=3 September 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraternization==
Air Force Instruction 36-2909 on ''Professional and Unprofessional Relationships'' says:
{{quote|Dating, courtship, and close friendships between men and women are subject to the same policy considerations as are other relationships. Like any personal [*pg 1038] relationship, they become matters of official concern when they adversely affect morale, discipline, unit cohesion, respect for authority, or mission accomplishment. Members must recognize that these relationships can adversely affect morale and discipline, even when the members are not in the same chain of command or unit. The formation of such relationships between superiors and subordinates within the same chain of command or supervision is prohibited because such relationships invariably raise the perception of favoritism or misuse of position and erode morale, discipline and unit cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?14+Duke+J.+Gender+L.+&amp;+Pol'y+1011|last=McSally |title= WOMEN IN COMBAT: IS THE CURRENT POLICY OBSOLETE? |publisher= |year=2007 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Sexual orientation==
{{main|DADT}}

Conservative commentary in the U.S. has taken the view that the service of gays in the military is deleterious to essential components of unit cohesion, such as moral and discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/12/03/wrecking-finest-military-world-price-pay-dont-ask-dont-tell/ | title = Is Wrecking the Finest Military In the World the Price We'll Pay for 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'? | last = North | first = Oliver | authorlink = Oliver North | date = December 3, 2010 | publisher = [[Fox News]] | accessdate = 2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Urvashi Vaid, criticizing the "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" policy in 1995, called unit cohesion a euphemism for "heterosexual male bonding" and wrote that "the essence of male bonding lay in the forcible suppression of undercurrents of homosexual desire."&lt;ref&gt;Urvashi Vaid, ''Virtual Equality: The Mainstreaming of Gay &amp; Lesbian Liberation'' (NY: Doubleday, 1995), 176&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The William Blake Archive''' is a [[digital humanities]] project first created in 1996. The project is sponsored by the [[Library of Congress]] and supported by the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].&lt;ref name = SiteInfo&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/site.info.html| publisher = The William Blake Archive| title = The William Blake Archive Site Info| accessdate = March 19, 2013|date = June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the [[Rossetti Archive]], the archive provides digital reproductions of the various works of [[William Blake]], a prominent [[Romanticism|Romantic]]-period poet, artist, and engraver, alongside annotation, commentary and scholarly materials related to Blake.&lt;ref name = Eaves&gt;{{cite journal| title = Behind the Scenes at the William Blake Archive: Collaboration Takes More Than E-mail | last = Eaves| first = Morris| volume = 3| issue = 2 | date = December 1997| journal = Journal of Electronic Publishing| doi = 10.3998/3336451.0003.202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When publishing his poetry, William Blake would create print block illustrations for his book, print his books in black and white and then hand paint the illustrations within the prints. Furthermore, many of his works underwent multiple editions of printing, each with unique variations in the prints used to illustrate the poems and the poems themselves. Because of this complex process and the quality of his art, his art and poetry has been highly sought by collectors and scholars. The archive, as a [[digital humanities]] project, provides high quality digital copies of the facsimiles, providing scholars and students an opportunity to see the complexity of his published works often not available by viewing the scholarly print editions.&lt;ref name = McQuail&gt;{{Cite web| title = Using the William Blake Archive in Teaching Poetry| first =Josephine A. | last = McQuail| work = "World Wide Poetry on the Web" a MLA Poetry Division Panel| url = http://epc.buffalo.edu/conferences/00/mla/web.html| publisher = The Electronic Poetry Center at The University of Buffalo| accessdate = March 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Viscomi&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Computers and the Humanities| date = February 2002| volume = 36| issue =  1| pages =27–48| title = Digital Facsimiles: Reading the William Blake Archive| first =Joseph | last =Viscomi| doi = 10.1023/A:1013163229994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archive has been peer reviewed by the [[Modern Language Association]] in 2005 and the [[Multimedia Educational Tools for Learning and Online Teaching]] (MERLOT) process in 2010.&lt;ref name = SiteInfo/&gt;&lt;ref name = MERLOT&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.merlot.org/merlot/viewCompositeReview.htm?id=502599|title = Peer Review:The William Blake Archive| date = Nov 25, 2010| author = English Editorial Board|accessdate = March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MERLOT highly recommended the use of the tool for teaching, praising the access to primary sources it provides; however, they also noted the need for educators to create instructional materials on how to use the site and the ease by which someone could get lost.&lt;ref name = MERLOT/&gt; Scholars have also written a number of educational case studies on how to use the archive.&lt;ref group =note&gt;See for example Josephine A.

'''RP''', the '''International Workshop on Reachability Problems''' is an annual [[academic conference]] in the
field of [[computer science]].

The Reachability Workshop is specifically aimed at gathering together scholars from diverse disciplines and backgrounds interested in [[reachability problem]]s that appear in
* [[Algebraic structure]]s
* [[Computational model]]s
* [[Hybrid system]]s
* [[Logic]] and [[Formal verification]]

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): Reachability problems in infinite state systems, [[rewriting system]]s, dynamical and hybrid systems; reachability problems in logic and verification; reachability analysis in different computational models, counter timed/ cellular/ communicating automata; [[Petri-Net]]s; computational aspects of algebraic structures (semigroups, groups and rings); frontiers between decidable and undecidable reachability problems; predictability in iterative maps and new computational paradigms.
