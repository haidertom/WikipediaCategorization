The '''NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC)''' is an aeronautical research center operated by [[NASA]]. Its primary campus is located inside [[Edwards Air Force Base]] and is considered NASA's premier site for aeronautical research.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/bldg_703/overview.html|title=Building 703 Facilities Overview|last=Conner|first=Monroe|date=2015-02-19|work=NASA|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFRC operates some of the most advanced aircraft in the world and is known for many aviation firsts, including critical support for the first manned [[airplane]] to exceed the [[speed of sound]] in level flight with the Bell X-1,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-085-DFRC.html|title=NASA Armstrong Fact Sheet: First Generation X-1|last=Gibbs|first=Yvonne|date=2015-08-12|work=NASA|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; highest speed ever recorded by a manned, powered aircraft (North American X-15),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/research/x15/|title=Aerospaceweb.org {{!}} Aircraft Museum - X-15|website=www.aerospaceweb.org|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-052-DFRC.html|title=NASA Armstrong Fact Sheet: X-15 Hypersonic Research Program|last=Gibbs|first=Yvonne|date=2015-08-13|work=NASA|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first pure digital fly-by-wire aircraft (F-8 DFBW),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/history/pastprojects/F8/index.html|title=F-8 Digital Fly-By-Wire|last=Gibbs|first=Yvonne|date=2017-05-10|work=NASA|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. AFRC also operates a second site in Palmdale, Ca. known as Building 703, once the former Rockwell International/North American Aircraft production facility, at Air Force Plant 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/bldg_703/index.html|title=Builiding 703 in Palmdale|last=Conner|first=Monroe|date=2015-02-19|work=NASA|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, AFRC houses and operates several of NASA's Science Mission Directorate aircraft including [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy|SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy)]], a DC-8 Flying Laboratory, a Gulfstream C-20A UAVSAR and ER-2 High Altitude Platform.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; David McBride is currently the center's director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/X-Press/mcbride_spotlight.html|title=New Dryden Director: Administrator Bolden Selects  David McBride|date=2010-01-15|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 2014, the facility was renamed in honor of [[Neil Armstrong]], a former test pilot at the center and the first human being to walk on the surface of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-center-renamed-for-neil-armstrong/|title=NASA Center Renamed in Honor of Neil A.

Dryden]], a prominent [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]] who at the time of his death in 1965 was NASA's deputy administrator. It has also previously been known as the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] '''Muroc Flight Test Unit''' (1945), the '''NACA High-Speed Flight Research Station''' (1949), the '''NACA High-Speed Flight Station''' (1954), the '''NASA High-Speed Flight Station''' (1958) and the '''NASA Flight Research Center''' (1959).

AFRC was also the home of the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] (SCA), a modified Boeing 747 designed to carry a Space Shuttle orbiter back to [[Kennedy Space Center]] if one landed at Edwards.

Until 2004, Armstrong Flight Research Center operated the oldest [[B-52 Stratofortress]] bomber, a B-52B model (tail number 008) which had been converted to [[drop test]] aircraft, dubbed '[[Balls 8]].'  It dropped a large number of [[supersonic]] test vehicles, ranging from the [[North American X-15|X-15]] to its last research program, the [[hypersonic]] [[X-43A]], powered by a [[Pegasus rocket]].  The aircraft was retired and is currently on display near the North Gate of Edwards.&lt;ref&gt;Google Earth imagery date 26 August 2012, {{Coord|34.99289444|-117.88343889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
Though Armstrong Flight Research Center has always been located on the shore of Rogers Dry Lake Bed, its precise location has changed over the years. It currently resides on the North Western Edge of the lakebed, just south of Edwards Air Force Bases' North Gate. Visitation to the center requires obtaining access to both Edwards AFB and NASA AFRC. Rogers dry lake bed offers a unique landscape which is well suited for flight research. Dry conditions, few rainy days per year, and large, flat, open spaces in which emergency landings can be performed. At times, Rodgers dry lake bed can host a runway length of over 40,000 feet, and is home to a 2000' diameter compass rose, in which aircraft can land into the wind in any direction.

===Douglas Skyrocket===
{{Main|Douglas Skyrocket}}
[[Image:D-558-2 Dropped from B-29 Mothership - GPN-2000-000251.jpg|thumb|left|NACA's Douglas D-558-II Skyrocket being dropped from a [[B-29 Superfortress]]]]
NASA's predecessor, NACA, operated the Douglas Skyrocket. A successor to the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]]'s [[Bell X-1]], the D-558-II could operate under [[rocket]] or [[jet engine|jet]] power. It conducted extensive tests into aircraft stability in the [[transsonic]] range, optimal supersonic wing configurations, rocket plume effects, and [[high-speed flight]] dynamics. On November 20, 1953, the Douglas Skyrocket became the first aircraft to fly at over twice the speed of sound when it attained a speed of Mach 2.005. Like the X-1, the D-558-II could be air-launched using a [[B-29 Superfortress]]. Unlike the X-1, the Skyrocket could also [[takeoff]] from a [[runway]] with the help of [[JATO]] units.

===Controlled Impact Demonstration===
{{Main|Controlled Impact Demonstration}}
[[Image:Boeing 720 Controlled Impact Demonstration.jpg|right|thumb|A remotely piloted [[Boeing 720]] is destroyed in the [[Controlled Impact Demonstration]].]]
The Controlled Impact Demonstration was a joint project with the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] to research a new jet fuel that would decrease the damage due to fire in the crash of a large airliner. On December 1, 1984, a remotely piloted [[Boeing 720]] aircraft was flown into specially built ''wing openers'' which tore the wings open, fuel spraying everywhere. Despite the new fuel additive, the resulting fire ball was huge; the fire still took an hour to fully extinguish.

Even though the fuel additive did not prevent a fire, the research was not a complete failure. The additive still prevented the combustion of some fuel which flowed over the fuselage of the aircraft, and served to cool it, similar to how a conventional [[rocket engine]] cools its nozzle. Also, instrumented [[crash test dummies]] were in the airplane for the impact, and provided valuable research into other aspects of crash survivability for the occupants.

===Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment===
[[Image:SR-71 LASRE cold test.jpg|thumb|left|A modern [[Skunk Works]] project leverages an older: [[LASRE]] atop an [[SR-71 Blackbird]].]]
{{Main|Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment}}
LASRE was a [[NASA]] experiment in cooperation with [[Lockheed Martin]] to study a [[reusable launch vehicle]] design based on a linear [[aerospike engine|aerospike]] [[rocket engine]]. The experiment's goal was to provide in-flight data to help [[Lockheed Martin]] validate the computational predictive tools they developed to design the craft. LASRE was a small, half-span model of a lifting body with eight thrust cells of an [[aerospike engine]]. The experiment, mounted on the back of an [[SR-71 Blackbird]] aircraft, operated like a kind of "flying [[wind tunnel]]."

The experiment focused on determining how a reusable launch vehicle's engine plume would affect the aerodynamics of its lifting body shape at specific altitudes and speeds reaching approximately {{convert|750|mph|m/s}}. The interaction of the aerodynamic flow with the engine plume could create drag; design refinements look to minimize that interaction.

===Lunar Landing Research Vehicle===
{{Main|Lunar Landing Research Vehicle}}
[[Image:LLRV 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lunar Landing Research Vehicle]]]]
The Lunar Landing Research Vehicle or LLRV was an [[Apollo Project]] era program to build a simulator for the [[Moon landing]]. The LLRVs, humorously referred to as "[[Flying bedstead|Flying Bedsteads]]", were used by the FRC, now known as the Armstrong Flight Research Center, at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], Calif., to study and analyze piloting techniques needed to fly and land the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] in the moon's airless environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7022">'''Art historical photo archives''' (or photoarchives) are collections of reproductions of works of art that document paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, architecture and sometimes installation photos. They are essential resource tools for the study of art history.  Image collections deepen understanding of specific objects of art and the careers of individual artists as they also provide the means for a comparative approach to the study of artists’ works, national schools and period styles.  The documentation that accompanies the images can also reveal patterns of art collecting, art market fluctuations and the changeable nature of public opinion.  Photo archives build their collections and gather documentation for the works of art they record through purchases, gifts and photography campaigns.  Information about ownership, condition, attribution, and subject identification is recorded at the time of acquisition and is frequently updated.

==History==

The  founders of important art historical photo archives believed that a deep and broad visual knowledge was necessary for the study of art history.   These pioneers,  including [[Richard Hamann]], [[Aby Warburg]], [[Sir Robert Witt]], [[William Martin Conway]], [[Bernard Berenson]], [[Cornelis Hofstede de Groot]] and [[Helen Clay Frick]], were the first to realize the potential of photography as a means to provide researchers with materials that strengthen the documentation and interpretation of works of art.   The photo archives they founded in the first half of the 20th century, now part of [[FotoMarburg]], the [[Warburg Institute]], the [[Witt Library]],  [[Villa I Tatti]], the [[Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie]], and the [[Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive]],  are still used by countless researchers in the first half of the 21st century.

==Uses==

*Art historical photo archives collect images of works without regard to trends or the popular reception of any given artist’s work. They thus retain files for artists not held in high esteem but whose reputations among scholars may change in years to come.
*Many of the works of art recorded in photo archives are unpublished or relatively inaccessible since they reside in private collections or public institution storerooms.
*Art historical photo archives provide a forum for scholarly dialogue across the decades, affording art historians the opportunity to record opinions regarding attribution or current ownership of works they know well.
*As art history and art connoisseurship have matured, photo archives have played a key role, the fruits of which are most obvious in publications such as Bernard Berenson’s lists of works by Italian artists and Richard Offner’s Corpus of Florentine Painting (today continued by Miklos Boskovits).  The refinement of attributions of works of art recorded in a photo archive can lead to the reevaluation of an artist’s career or the identification of a new, previously unnamed master.  In this way, a photo archive functions in much the same way as the curatorial records of museum drawings departments, where annotations by scholars of several generations record the various attributions ascribed to the work over time.
*Photo archives aid researchers in their connoisseurship skills since they include copies, forgeries and pastiches.
*Multiple images of a single work of art help scholars trace the physical changes that have affected the object through time, damage, and conservation.  Photo archives often document the full visual record of a given work of art, information that is unlikely to be published because of financial limitations.
*Photo archives enable discovery and innovative scholarship as researchers browse within and across artist files.
*Photo archives are essential to the study of works of art that have been destroyed or lost as a result of war, fire or theft.

==Future==

In 2009 the Courtauld Institute in collaboration with the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz organized a series of conferences that were held in  London, Florence and New York to discuss the future of photo archives.  They felt that an examination of the origins of photo archives can help guide and shape their future and, at the same time, convey to the uninitiated how image resources continue to be used as essential elements for art historical research. Few doubt that if Helen Frick, Robert Witt, or W.M. Conway had lived to see the potential of digitizing the photo archives they established in the 1920s, they would have dedicated enormous resources and careful thought to realizing the digital future.  However, there is a problem for photo archives in that currently they have no copyright claim to the majority of the images in their collection and thus they are unable to display them on the web.  It is therefore now their task to develop and promote a new model for access and use of these extraordinary resources that will maximize the opportunities of current and future technical advances in a way that suits the demands of today’s scholars.  This selection process, which is implicit in digitization projects and will inevitably exclude some images, renders the analog archive as indispensable as ever in the digital era.  Whatever the method of delivery, whether the photograph itself or its digital surrogate, photo archives remain essential to the study of art history.  The conferences produced the [[Florence Declaration]], which made several recommendations for the preservation of analogue photo archives.  As of May 2011, nearly 500 scholars had signed the Declaration.

The '''Awza'i''' ({{lang-ar|الأوزاعي|al-Awzā‘ī}}) [[madhhab]]  was one of the schools of [[Fiqh]], the Islamic jurisprudence, or [[religious law]] within [[Sunni Islam]] in the 8th century.  Its [[Imam]] was [[Abd al-Rahman al-Awza'i]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://daralnicosia.wordpress.com/2011/05/14/imam-al-awzai-and-accounting-rulers/|title=Imam al-Awza`i and Accounting Rulers|first=Dar al-Nicosia / دار|last=نيـقـوسـيــا|date=14 May 2011|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===In the Maghreb and al-Andalus===
Some posit that the reason why the people of Morocco took up the madhhab of Imam Malik, is that the people of Morocco and [[al-Andalus]] were originally upon the madhhab of al-Awza’i. However since the Umayyad conquest of the region and the [[Berber revolt]], Morocco and western Algeria were following [[Kharijites]] schools which were adopted by the ruling dynasties such as the [[Maghrawa]], the emirate of Toudgha and the [[Ibadhi]] [[Rustamid dynasty]]. And, with the exception of [[Tunisia]] and al-Andalus, the Maliki school only became established in the region after the rise of the [[Almoravid dynasty]].

Then during the rule of [[Al-Hakam I]], the official fatwas were changed and given according to the opinion of Malik ibn Anas and the people of [[Medina|al-Madina]]. This was due to the opinion and preference of al-Hakam due to some political benefits he saw and they differ about the actual reason, which still remains unclear. Most hold that it was due to the scholars of al-Andalus travelling to Medina, then when they returned they spoke of the excellence of Malik, his wide knowledge and great station, so they honoured him and preferred his Madhhab. Others say that Imam Malik asked some of the people of al-Andalus about the rule in their region and they described it to him and Malik was very pleased by it since the [[Abbasids]] in that time did not rule in a manner that was agreeable. So, Imam Malik said to the person who told him, ‘We ask Allaah to enlighten our sacred precincts with your rule.’ This was transmitted to the ruler of al-Andalus, who already knew of the knowledge, excellence and piety of Malik; so he led the people to accept his Madhhab and ordered that the madhhab of al-Awza’i be abandoned. Later, the kings of Morocco and the west agreed that the rulings and actions should be according to the preferences of Ibn al-Qaasim al-`Utaqi (a famous student of Malik) only.{{when|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;“Nafh ut-Teeb min Ghasn il-Andalus ir-rateeb,” by Ahmad al-Muqree al-Maghribee (3/158)&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Syria===
In Syria, the Madhhab of al-Awza’i remained the main school of thought until the 10th century, when Abu Zar’ah Muhammed ibn Uthman of the Shafi’ee Madhhab was appointed judge of Damascus. Abu Zar’ah began the practice of giving a prize of 100 dinars to any student who memorized the book, Mukhtasr al-Muzanee (the basics of Shafi’ee fiqh). Naturally, the practice caused the Shafi’ee Madhhab to spread rapidly in Syria, until none of al-Awza’i’s followers remained until the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;”al-Madkhal,” pg.205-206, and “Fiqh al-Imaam al-Awza’i,” by ‘Abdullah Muhammed al-Jabooree,&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gary Becker Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics'''&lt;ref name="bfiannounce"&gt;{{cite web |date=June 17, 2011 |title=Becker Friedman Institute established at University of Chicago |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2011/06/17/becker-friedman-institute-established-university-chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt; was established at the [[University of Chicago]] in June 2011 as a collaborative, cross-disciplinary center for research in economics. It brought together the activities of two formerly independent economic research centers at the University:  the [[Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics]] and the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory, founded by Richard O. Ryan, MBA ’66.

The institute is named for two globally influential economists: [[Gary S. Becker]] (1930–2014) and his mentor,  [[Milton Friedman]] (1912-2006), both winners of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. While they pursued different scholarly paths, Becker and Friedman shared a fundamental belief that economics, grounded in empirical research, is a powerful tool to understand human behavior. While Friedman is known for his lasting contributions to macroeconomics and monetary economics, Becker is recognized for extending microeconomic analysis to a wide range of fields and topics.

A collaboration of the University of Chicago [[Booth School of Business]], [[University of Chicago Law School|Law School]], [http://economics.uchicago.edu/ Department of Economics], and the [[Harris School of Public Policy Studies|Harris School for Public Policy]], the Institute builds bridges across disciplines and subfields of economics. Its research conferences, workshops, and initiatives bring economists and scholars from related fields together to share perspectives and refine ideas. The institute also sponsors an active visiting scholars program and offers programs and support for students and promising young researchers. 

The institute supports research initiatives in traditional Chicago strengths such as price theory, law and economics, and human capital, as well as topical inquiries into important policy issues such as fiscal imbalance, [[systemic risk]], [[policy uncertainty]], and economics of the family, and newer areas like field experiments in economics.

The institute is cochaired by [[Lars Peter Hansen]], a 2013 Nobel laureate who guides the intellectual agenda, and [[Kevin M. Murphy]], a distinguished microeconomist who focuses on public outreach activities  and development. An [https://bfi.uchicago.edu/about/leadership Institute Research Council] of distinguished faculty from collaborating university units advises the cochairs.

'''Bisexuality''' is [[Romance (love)|romantic]] attraction, [[sexual attraction]], or [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] toward both males and females,&lt;!-- SOURCING: As discussed on the talk page, there are two definitions of bisexuality, but the one used by authoritative sources and dictionary/other encyclopedic sources only mentions two sexes/two genders (male/female and man/woman), not "all sexes/genders," "more than one gender" or "irrespective of gender." Initially stating "males and females" is following the Wikipedia WP:Due weight policy and keeps things simple without delving into the complex issues of sex and gender, which are broached in the rest of the paragraph (and lower in the article) with the second definition of bisexuality and how that may be termed "pansexuality." --&gt;&lt;ref name="AmPsycholAssn-whatis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual orientation, homosexuality and bisexuality|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=21 April 2014|url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx|archivedate=8 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808032050/http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="healthyminds.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Orientation|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|archivedate=26 July 2011|accessdate=3 December 2012|url=http://healthyminds.org/More-Info-For/GayLesbianBisexuals.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726144306/http://healthyminds.org/More-Info-For/GayLesbianBisexuals.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glaad"&gt;{{cite web|title=GLAAD Media Reference Guide|accessdate=14 March 2012 |publisher=[[GLAAD]]|url=http://www.glaad.org/document.doc?id=99|archivedate=1 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101043203/http://www.glaad.org/document.doc?id=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; or romantic or sexual attraction to people of any [[sex]] or [[gender identity]]; this latter aspect is sometimes alternatively termed ''[[pansexuality]].''&lt;ref name="Soble"&gt;{{cite book|last=Soble|first=Alan|title=Sex from Plato to Paglia: a philosophical encyclopedia|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|volume=1|page=115 |isbn=978-0-313-32686-8|year=2006|chapter=Bisexuality|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Firestein"&gt;{{cite book| first = Beth A. | last = Firestein | title = Becoming Visible: Counseling Bisexuals Across the Lifespan|publisher = [[Columbia University Press]] | pages = 9–12 | year = 2007| accessdate = 3 October 2012 |isbn =0231137249|id={{ISBN|9780231137249}}|url = https://books.google.com/?id=1pCKkZmBU1EC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;q=Bisexuality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and society"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex and Society|volume=2|page=593|last=Rice|first=Kim|isbn=978-0-7614-7905-5|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|year=2009|editor=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|contribution=Pansexuality|accessdate=3 October 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YtsxeWE7VD0C&amp;pg=PA593&amp;lpg=PA593&amp;q=Pansexuality|quote=In some contexts, the term pansexuality is used interchangeably with bisexuality, which refers to attraction to individuals of both sexes...

The term ''bisexuality'' is mainly used in the context of human attraction to denote romantic or sexual feelings toward both men and women,&lt;ref name="AmPsycholAssn-whatis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="healthyminds.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="glaad"/&gt; and the concept is one of the three main classifications of [[sexual orientation]] along with [[heterosexuality]] and [[homosexuality]], all of which exist on the [[heterosexual–homosexual continuum]]. A bisexual identity does not necessarily equate to equal sexual attraction to both sexes; commonly, people who have a distinct but not exclusive sexual preference for one sex over the other also identify themselves as bisexual.&lt;ref name="Rosario"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosario | first1 = M. | last2 = Schrimshaw | first2 = E. | last3 = Hunter | first3 = J. | last4 = Braun | first4 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths: Consistency and change over time | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 46–58 | doi=10.1080/00224490609552298| pmid = 16817067 | pmc = 3215279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''bisexuality'', however, like the terms ''hetero-'' and ''homosexuality'', was coined in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="etymon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bisexuality |title=Bisexuality |accessdate=16 February 2007 |author=Harper, Douglas |date=November 2001  |work=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

=== Sexual orientation, identity, and behavior ===
{{Main|Sexual orientation|Sexual identity|Human sexual activity}}

Bisexuality is romantic or sexual attraction to both males and females. The [[American Psychological Association]] states that "sexual orientation falls along a continuum. In other words, someone does not have to be exclusively homosexual or heterosexual, but can feel varying degrees of both. Sexual orientation develops across a person's lifetime–different people realize at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual."&lt;ref name="Rosario"/&gt;&lt;ref name=apa2009&gt;{{cite journal|title=Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |pages=63, 86|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2011|quote=Sexual orientation identity—not sexual orientation—appears to change via psychotherapy, support groups, and life events.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual attraction, behavior, and identity may also be incongruent, as sexual attraction or behavior may not necessarily be consistent with identity. Some individuals identify themselves as heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual without having had any sexual experience. Others have had homosexual experiences but do not consider themselves to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt; Likewise, self-identified gay or lesbian individuals may occasionally sexually interact with members of the opposite sex but do not identify as bisexual.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt; The terms ''[[queer]]'',&lt;ref name="Firestein"/&gt; ''[[Polysexuality|polysexual]]'',&lt;ref name="Firestein"/&gt; ''[[heteroflexible]]'', ''homoflexible,'' ''[[men who have sex with men]]'' and ''[[women who have sex with women]]'' may also be used to describe sexual identity or identify sexual behavior.

Some sources state that bisexuality encompasses romantic or sexual attraction to all [[gender identity|gender identities]] or that it is romantic or sexual attraction to a person irrespective of that person's biological sex or gender, equating it to or rendering it interchangeable with [[pansexuality]].&lt;ref name="Soble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt; The concept of pansexuality deliberately rejects the [[gender binary]], the "notion of two genders and indeed of specific sexual orientations",&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt; as pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women.&lt;ref name="Soble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt;

The bisexual activist [[Robyn Ochs]] defines bisexuality as "the potential to be attracted—romantically and/or sexually—to people of more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisner|first=Shiri|title=Bi: Notes for a Bi Revolution|year=2013|publisher=Seal Press|isbn=978-1-58005-474-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006):&lt;blockquote&gt;...the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity. Rather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Rosario"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bisexuality as a transitional identity has also been examined. In a [[longitudinal study]] about sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youths, Rosario et al. "found evidence of both considerable consistency and change in LGB sexual identity over time". Youths who had identified as both gay/lesbian and bisexual prior to baseline were approximately three times more likely to identify as gay/lesbian than as bisexual at subsequent assessments. Of youths who had identified only as bisexual at earlier assessments, 60 to 70 percent continued to thus identify, while approximately 30 to 40 percent assumed a gay/lesbian identity over time. Rosario et al. suggested that "although there were youths who consistently self-identified as bisexual throughout the study, for other youths, a bisexual identity served as a transitional identity to a subsequent gay/lesbian identity."&lt;ref name="Rosario"/&gt; By contrast, a longitudinal study by [[Lisa M. Diamond]], which followed women identifying as lesbian, bisexual, or unlabeled, found that "more women adopted bisexual/unlabeled identities than relinquished these identities," over a ten-year period. The study also found that "bisexual/unlabeled women had stable overall distributions of same-sex/other-sex attractions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Lisa M.|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2008|volume=44|issue=1|pages=5–14|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.44.1.5|pmid=18194000|title=Female bisexuality from adolescence to adulthood: results from a 10-year longitudinal study}}&lt;!--|accessdate=19 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond has also studied male bisexuality, noting that survey research found "almost as many men transitioned at some point from a gay identity to a bisexual, queer or unlabeled one, as did from a bisexual identity to a gay identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Scientific Quest to Prove Bisexuality Exists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/magazine/the-scientific-quest-to-prove-bisexuality-exists.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=21 March 2014|work=The New York Times Magazine, 20 March 2014|first=Benoit|last=Denizet-Lewis|date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Sexuality Preconference|url=http://www.sexatspsp.com/schedule/|work=Fifteenth Annual Meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology - Preconferences|publisher=Society for Personality and Social Psychology|accessdate=21 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321072854/http://www.sexatspsp.com/schedule/|archivedate=21 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kinsey scale ===
{{Main|Kinsey scale}}

In the 1940s, the zoologist [[Alfred Kinsey]] created a scale to measure the continuum of sexual orientation from heterosexuality to homosexuality. Kinsey studied human sexuality and argued that people have the capability of being hetero- or homosexual even if this trait does not present itself in the current circumstances.&lt;ref name="Young-Bruehl"&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Young-Bruehl  |first=Elisabeth  |title=Are Human Beings "By Nature" Bisexual?  |journal=Studies in Gender and Sexuality  |volume=3  |issue=2  |pages=179–213  |year=2001  |doi=10.1080/15240650209349175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinsey scale is used to describe a person's sexual experience or response at a given time. It ranges from 0, meaning exclusively heterosexual, to 6, meaning exclusively homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/research/ak-hhscale.html Kinseys hetero homo rating scale] Retrieved 7 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; People who rank anywhere from 2 to 4 are often considered bisexual; they are often not fully one extreme or the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szymanski|first1=Mike|title=Moving Closer to the Middle: ''Kinsey'' the Movie, and Its Rocky Road to Bisexual Acceptance|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|date=2008|volume=8|issue=3–4|pages=287–308|doi=10.1080/15299710802501918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologists [[Martin S. Weinberg]] and [[Colin J. Williams]] write that, in principle, people who rank anywhere from 1 to 5 could be considered bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Weinberg, Martin S. |author2=Williams, Colin J. |author3=Pryor, Douglas W. |title=Dual Attraction: Understanding Bisexuality |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-19-509841-2 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist Jim McKnight writes that while the idea that bisexuality is a form of sexual orientation intermediate between homosexuality and heterosexuality is implicit in the Kinsey scale, that conception has been "severely challenged" since the publication of ''[[Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women|Homosexualities]]'' (1978), by Weinberg and the psychologist [[Alan P. Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, Jim. ''Straight Science: Homosexuality, Evolution and Adaptation''. Routledge, 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics and prevalence==
{{Main|Demographics of sexual orientation|Kinsey Reports}}

Kinsey's 1948 work ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'' found that "46% of the male population had engaged in both heterosexual and homosexual activities, or 'reacted to' persons of both sexes, in the course of their adult lives".&lt;ref name=institute&gt;[http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-data.html Research Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726194522/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-data.html |date=26 July 2010}} from the [http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/ Kinsey Institute].&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey himself disliked the use of the term ''bisexual'' to describe individuals who engage in sexual activity with both males and females, preferring to use ''bisexual'' in its original, biological sense as [[hermaphroditic]], stating, "Until it is demonstrated [that] taste in a sexual relation is dependent upon the individual containing within his anatomy both male and female structures, or male and female physiological capacities, it is unfortunate to call such individuals bisexual."&lt;ref name="Stange"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, A. C., Pomeroy, W. B., &amp; Martin, C. E. (1948). ''Sexual behavior in the human male.'' Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders. p 657.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior'', published in 1993, showed that 5 percent of men and 3 percent of women considered themselves bisexual and 4 percent of men and 2 percent of women considered themselves homosexual.&lt;ref name="Kinsey FAQ"/&gt;

More modern studies estimating the demographics for bisexuality have varied. A 2002 survey in the United States by [[National Center for Health Statistics]] found that 1.8 percent of men ages 18–44 considered themselves bisexual, 2.3 percent homosexual, and 3.9 percent as "something else". The same study found that 2.8 percent of women ages 18–44 considered themselves bisexual, 1.3 percent homosexual, and 3.8 percent as "something else".&lt;ref name="Kinsey FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html|title=Frequently Asked Sexuality Questions to the Kinsey Institute |accessdate=16 February 2007 |publisher=The Kinsey Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, an article in the 'Health' section of ''The New York Times'' stated that "1.5 percent of American women and 1.7 percent of American men identify themselves [as] bisexual."&lt;ref name="Carey" /&gt; Also in 2007, it was reported that 14.4 percent of young US women identified themselves as "not strictly heterosexual", with 5.6 percent of the men identifying as gay or bisexual.&lt;ref name="Lesbian and bisexual women"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sax-sex/201004/why-are-so-many-girls-lesbian-or-bisexual?page=2 |title=Why Are So Many Girls Lesbian or Bisexual? |accessdate=28 April 2011 |author=Leonard Sax|publisher= Sussex Directories/''[[Psychology Today]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in the journal ''[[Biological Psychology (journal)|Biological Psychology]]'' in 2011 reported that there were men who identify themselves as ''bisexuals'' and who were aroused by both men and women.&lt;ref name=twsO28&gt;{{cite news| author = Elizabeth Landau| title = Bisexual men: Science says they're real| work = CNN| quote = ...confirms that men with bisexual arousal patterns and bisexual identity definitely exist...| date = 23 August 2011| url =  http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/23/bisexual-men-science-says-theyre-real/?hpt=hp_t2| accessdate = 2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first large-scale government survey measuring Americans' sexual orientation, the [[National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)|NHIS]] reported in July 2014 that only 0.7 percent of Americans identify as bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/health-survey-gives-government-its-first-large-scale-data-on-gay-bisexual-population/2014/07/14/2db9f4b0-092f-11e4-bbf1-cc51275e7f8f_story.html|title=Health survey gives government its first large-scale data on gay, bisexual population|work=Washington Post|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an anthropological perspective, there is large variation in the prevalence of bisexuality between different cultures. Among some tribes, it appears to be non-existent while in others a universal, including the [[Sambia people|Sambia]] of [[New Guinea]] and similar [[Melanesian]] cultures.&lt;ref name=VanWyk/&gt;

[[Magnus Hirschfeld]] argued that adult sexual orientation can be explained in terms of the bisexual nature of the developing fetus: he believed that in every embryo there is one rudimentary neutral center for attraction to males and another for attraction to females. In most fetuses, the center for attraction to the opposite sex developed while the center for attraction to the same sex regressed, but in fetuses that became homosexual, the reverse occurred. [[Simon LeVay]] has criticized Hirschfeld's theory of an early bisexual stage of development, calling it confusing; LeVay maintains that Hirschfeld failed to distinguish between saying that the brain is sexually undifferentiated at an early stage of development and saying that an individual actually experiences sexual attraction to both men and women. According to LeVay, Hirschfeld believed that in most bisexual people the strength of attraction to the same sex was relatively low, and that it was therefore possible to restrain its development in young people, something Hirschfeld supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=LeVay, Simon |authorlink=Simon LeVay |title=Queer Science: The Use and Abuse of Research into Homosexuality |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1996 |isbn=0-262-12199-9 |pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirschfeld created a ten-point scale to measure the strength of sexual desire, with the direction of desire being represented by the letters A (for heterosexuality), B (for homosexuality), and A + B (for bisexuality). On this scale, someone who was A3, B9 would be weakly attracted to the opposite sex and very strongly attracted to the same sex, an A0, B0 would be asexual, and an A10, B10 would be very attracted to both sexes. LeVay compares Hirschfeld's scale to that developed by Kinsey decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=LeVay, Simon |authorlink=Simon LeVay |title=Queer Science: The Use and Abuse of Research into Homosexuality |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1996 |isbn=0-262-12199-9 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that every human being is bisexual in the sense of incorporating general attributes of both sexes. In his view, this was true anatomically and therefore also psychologically, with sexual attraction to both sexes being an aspect of this psychological bisexuality. Freud believed that in the course of sexual development the masculine side of this bisexual disposition would normally become dominant in men and the feminine side in women, but that all adults still have desires derived from both the masculine and the feminine sides of their natures. Freud did not claim that everyone is bisexual in the sense of feeling the same level of sexual attraction to both genders. Freud's belief in innate bisexuality was rejected by [[Sandor Rado|Sándor Radó]] in 1940 and, following Radó, by many later psychoanalysts. Radó argued that there is no biological bisexuality in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruse, Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |title=Homosexuality: A Philosophical Inquiry |publisher=Basil Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=1988 |isbn=0 631 15275 X |pages=22, 25, 45, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychoanalyst [[Edmund Bergler]] argued in ''[[Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life?]]'' (1956) that bisexuality does not exist and that all supposed bisexuals are homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bergler, Edmund |authorlink=Edmund Bergler |title=Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life? |publisher=Hill and Wang, Inc |location=New York |year=1957 |isbn= |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan P. Bell]], [[Martin S. Weinberg]], and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith reported in ''[[Sexual Preference (book)|Sexual Preference]]'' (1981) that sexual preference was much less strongly connected with pre-adult sexual feelings among bisexuals than it was among heterosexuals and homosexuals. Based on this and other findings, they suggested that bisexuality is more influenced by social and sexual learning than is exclusive homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bell, Alan P. |author2=Weinberg, Martin S. |author3=Hammersmith, Sue Kiefer |title=Sexual Preference: Its Development in Men and Women |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |year=1981 |isbn=0-253-16673-X |pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letitia Anne Peplau ''et al.'' wrote that while Bell ''et al.''′s view that biological factors may be more influential on homosexuality than on bisexuality might seem plausible, it has not been directly tested and appears to conflict with available evidence, such as that concerning prenatal hormone exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Peplau_Lab/Publications_files/Peplau%20et%20al.%2099_1.pdf |title=The Development of Sexual Orientation in Women |accessdate=11 July 2017 |author1=Peplau, Letitia Anne |author2=Spalding, Leah R. |author3=Conley, Terri D. |author4=Veniegas, Rosemary C. |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human bisexuality has mainly been studied alongside homosexuality. Van Wyk and Geist argue that this is a problem for sexuality research because the few studies that have observed bisexuals separately have found that bisexuals are often different from both heterosexuals and homosexuals. Furthermore, bisexuality does not always represent a halfway point between the dichotomy. Research indicates that bisexuality is influenced by biological, cognitive and cultural variables in interaction, and this leads to different types of bisexuality.&lt;ref name=VanWyk&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Wyk PH, Geist CS |title=Biology of Bisexuality: Critique and Observations |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |volume=28 |issue=3–4 |pages=357–373 |year=1995 |doi=10.1300/J082v28n03_11 |pmid=7560936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the current debate around influences on sexual orientation, biological explanations have been questioned by social scientists, particularly by feminists who encourage women to make conscious decisions about their life and sexuality. A difference in attitude between homosexual men and women has also been reported, with men more likely to regard their sexuality as biological, "reflecting the universal male experience in this culture, not the complexities of the lesbian world." There is also evidence that women's sexuality may be more strongly affected by cultural and contextual factors.&lt;ref name=Veniegas&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Veniegas  |first=Rosemary c.  |author2=Terri D. Conley  |title=Biological Research on Women's Sexual Orientations: Evaluating the Scientific Evidence  |journal= Journal of Social Issues  |volume=56  |issue=2  |pages=267–282  |year=2000  |doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic [[Camille Paglia]] has promoted bisexuality as an ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paglia, Camille |authorlink=Camille Paglia |title=Vamps and Tramps: New Essays |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-14-024828-5 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard Shakespeare professor [[Marjorie Garber]] made an academic case for bisexuality with her 1995 book ''Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life,'' in which she argued that most people would be bisexual if not for repression and other factors such as lack of sexual opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garber, Marjorie B. |authorlink=Marjorie Garber |title=Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-92661-0 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brain structure and chromosomes ===

LeVay's (1991) examination at autopsy of 18 homosexual men, 1 bisexual man, 16 presumably heterosexual men and 6 presumably heterosexual women found that the [[INAH 3]] nucleus of the anterior [[hypothalamus]] of homosexual men was smaller than that of heterosexual men and closer in size of heterosexual women. Although grouped with homosexuals, the INAH 3 size of the one bisexual subject was similar to that of the heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=VanWyk/&gt;

Some evidence supports the concept of biological precursors of bisexual orientation in genetic males. According to Money (1988), genetic males with an extra [[Y chromosome]] are more likely to be bisexual, [[paraphilia|paraphilic]] and impulsive.&lt;ref name=VanWyk/&gt;

=== Evolutionary theory ===

Some evolutionary psychologists have argued that same-sex attraction does not have adaptive value because it has no association with potential reproductive success. Instead, bisexuality can be due to normal variation in brain plasticity. More recently, it has been suggested that same-sex alliances may have helped males climb the social hierarchy giving access to females and reproductive opportunities. Same-sex allies could have helped females to move to the safer and resource richer center of the group, which increased their chances of raising their offspring successfully.&lt;ref name=Muscarella/&gt;

Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12465295|title=The evolution of homosexuality: Gender bending - The Economist|work=The Economist|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in a 2008 study, its authors stated that "There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency." They hypothesized that "while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them" and their results suggested that "genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zietsch | first1 = B. | last2 = Morley | first2 = K. | last3 = Shekar | first3 = S. | last4 = Verweij | first4 = K. | last5 = Keller | first5 = M. | last6 = Macgregor | first6 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Genetic factors predisposing to homosexuality may increase mating success in heterosexuals | url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 6| pages = 424–433 | doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2008.07.002 | display-authors = 6 | last7 = Wright | first7 = M | last8 = Bailey | first8 = J | last9 = Martin | first9 = N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Scientific American Mind]]'', the scientist Emily V. Driscoll stated that homosexual and bisexual behavior is quite common in several species and that it fosters bonding: "The more homosexuality, the more peaceful the species". The article also stated: "Unlike most humans, however, individual animals generally cannot be classified as gay or straight: an animal that engages in a same-sex flirtation or partnership does not necessarily shun heterosexual encounters. Rather, many species seem to have ingrained homosexual tendencies that are a regular part of their society. That is, there are probably no strictly gay critters, just bisexual ones. Animals don't do sexual identity. They just do sex."&lt;ref name="Unorthodox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/2850 |title=Bisexual Species: Unorthodox Sex in the Animal Kingdom |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125201624/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/2850 |archivedate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Masculinization ===

[[Masculinization]] of women and hypermasculinization of men has been a central theme in sexual orientation research. There are several studies suggesting that bisexuals have a high degree of masculinization. LaTorre and Wendenberg (1983) found differing personality characteristics for bisexual, heterosexual and homosexual women. Bisexuals were found to have fewer personal insecurities than heterosexuals and homosexuals. This finding defined bisexuals as self-assured and less likely to suffer from mental instabilities. The confidence of a secure identity consistently translated to more masculinity than other subjects. This study did not explore societal norms, prejudices, or the feminization of homosexual males.&lt;ref name=VanWyk/&gt;

In a research comparison, published in the ''Journal of the Association for Research in [[Otolaryngology]]'', women usually have a better hearing sensitivity than males, assumed by researchers as a genetic disposition connected to child bearing. Homosexual and bisexual women have been found to have a hypersensitivity to sound in comparison to heterosexual women, suggesting a genetic disposition to not tolerate high pitched tones. While heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual men have been found to exhibit similar patterns of hearing, there was a notable differential within a sub-group of males identified as hyperfeminized homosexual males who exhibited test results similar to heterosexual women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =  McFadden| first =  D.| author2 = Champlin, CA| title = Comparison of auditory evoked potentials in heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual males and females| journal = JARO&amp;nbsp;– Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 89–99| date = March 2000| url =  http://www.springerlink.com/content/qjl332876123011m/| doi = 10.1007/s101620010008| accessdate = 19 June 2008| pmc = 2504562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prenatal hormones ===

The prenatal hormonal theory of sexual orientation suggests that people who are exposed to excess levels of sex hormones have masculinized brains and show increased homosexuality or bisexuality. Studies providing evidence for the masculinization of the brain have, however, not been conducted to date. Research on special conditions such as [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) and exposure to [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) indicate that prenatal exposure to, respectively, excess [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]s are associated with female–female sex fantasies in adults. Both effects are associated with bisexuality rather than homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Veniegas/&gt;

There is research evidence that the digit [[ratio]] of the length of the 2nd and 4th digits (index finger and ring finger) is somewhat negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively to estrogen. Studies measuring the fingers found a statistically significant skew in the 2D:4D ratio (long ring finger) towards homosexuality with an even lower ratio in bisexuals. It is suggested that exposure to high prenatal testosterone and low prenatal estrogen concentrations is one cause of homosexuality whereas exposure to very high testosterone levels may be associated with bisexuality. Because testosterone in general is important for sexual differentiation, this view offers an alternative to the suggestion that male homosexuality is genetic.&lt;ref name=pmid11053694&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(00)00052-0 |pmid=11053694 |title=The ratio of 2nd to 4th digit length and male homosexuality |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=333–345 |year=2000 |last1=Robinson |first1=S |last2=Manning |first2=J. T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prenatal hormonal theory suggests that a homosexual orientation results from exposure to excessive testosterone causing an over-masculinized brain. This is contradictory to another hypothesis that homosexual preferences may be due to a feminized brain in males. However, it has also been suggested that homosexuality may be due to high prenatal levels of unbound testosterone that results from a lack of receptors at particular brain sites. Therefore, the brain could be feminized while other features, such as the 2D:4D ratio could be over-masculinized.&lt;ref name=Muscarella/&gt;

=== Sex drive ===
Several studies comparing bisexuals with hetero- or homosexuals have indicated that bisexuals have higher rates of sexual activity, fantasy or erotic interest. Van Wyk and Geist (1984) found that male and female bisexuals had more sexual fantasy than heterosexuals. Dixon (1985) found that bisexual men had more sexual activities with women than did heterosexual men. Bisexual men masturbated more but had fewer happy marriages than heterosexuals. Bressler and Lavender (1986) found that bisexual women had more orgasms per week and they described them as stronger than those of hetero- or homosexual women. They also found that marriages with a bisexual female were happier than heterosexual unions, observed less instance of hidden infidelity, and ended in divorce less frequently. Goode and Haber (1977) found bisexual women to be sexually mature earlier, masturbate and enjoy masturbation more and to be more experienced in different types of heterosexual contact.&lt;ref name=VanWyk/&gt;

Research suggests that, for most women, high sex drive is associated with increased sexual attraction to both women and men. For men, however, high sex drive is associated with increased attraction to one sex or the other, but not to both, depending on sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lippa | first1 = R. A. | year = 2006 | title = Is High Sex Drive Associated With Increased Sexual Attraction to Both Sexes?.

==Community==
{{main|Bisexual community}}

===General social impacts===

The bisexual community (also known as the bisexual/pansexual, bi/pan/fluid, or non-monosexual community) includes members of the [[LGBT community]] who identify as bisexual, pansexual or fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://binetusa.blogspot.com/2009/04/we-are-all-somewhere-between-straight.html|title=We are all somewhere between straight and gay|last=Estraven|date=20 April 2009|publisher=[[BiNet USA]] News and Opinions|accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because some bisexual people do not feel that they fit into either the gay or the heterosexual world, and because they have a tendency to be "invisible" in public, some bisexual persons are committed to forming their own communities, culture, and political movements. Some who identify as bisexual may merge themselves into either homosexual or heterosexual society. Other bisexual people see this merging as enforced rather than voluntary; bisexual people can face exclusion from both homosexual and heterosexual society on coming out. Psychologist Beth Firestein states that bisexuals tend to internalize social tensions related to their choice of partners&lt;ref name="newgen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb02/generation.html |title=A new generation of issues for LGBT clients |accessdate=16 February 2007 |author=DeAngelis, Tori |date=February 2002  |work=Monitor on Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; and feel pressured to label themselves as homosexuals instead of occupying the difficult middle ground where attraction to people of both sexes would defy society's value on monogamy.&lt;ref name="newgen"/&gt; These social tensions and pressure may affect bisexuals' mental health, and specific therapy methods have been developed for bisexuals to address this concern.&lt;ref name="newgen"/&gt;

Bisexual behaviors are also associated in popular culture with men who engage in same-sex activity while otherwise presenting as heterosexual. The majority of such men&amp;nbsp;— said to be ''living on the [[down-low (MSM)|down-low]]''&amp;nbsp;— do not self-identify as bisexual.&lt;ref name="boykin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keithboykin.com/arch/001311.html |title=10 Things You Should Know About the DL |accessdate=23 February 2007 |author=Boykin, Keith |date=3 February 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427005112/http://www.keithboykin.com/arch/001311.html |archivedate=27 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may be a cultural misperception closely related to that of other LGBT individuals who hide their actual orientation due to societal pressures, a phenomenon colloquially called ''"being [[closeted]]"''.{{original research inline|date=December 2015}}

In the U.S., a 2013 [[Pew survey]] showed that 28% of bisexuals said that "all or most of the important people in their life are aware that they are LGBT" vs. 77% of gay men and 71% of lesbians. Furthermore, when broken down by gender, only 12% of bisexual men said that they were "out" vs. 33% of bisexual women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Pew Research Center | date = 13 June 2013 | title = A Survey of LGBT Americans: Attitudes, Experiences and Values in Changing Times | url = http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2013/06/SDT_LGBT-Americans_06-2013.pdf | pages = 44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceptions and discrimination===
{{main|Biphobia|Bisexual erasure}}

Like people of other LGBT sexualities, bisexuals often face discrimination.

Male bisexuality is particularly presumed to be non-existent,&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt; with [[sexual fluidity]] studies adding to the debate. In 2005, researchers Gerulf Rieger, [[Meredith Chivers|Meredith L. Chivers]], and [[J. Michael Bailey]] used [[penile plethysmography]] to measure the arousal of self-identified bisexual men to pornography involving only men and pornography involving only women. Participants were recruited via advertisements in gay-oriented magazines and an alternative paper. They found that the self-identified bisexual men in their sample had genital arousal patterns similar to either homosexual or heterosexual men. The authors concluded that "in terms of behavior and identity, bisexual men clearly exist", but that male bisexuality had not been shown to exist with respect to arousal or attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rieger G, Chivers ML, Bailey JM |title=Sexual arousal patterns of bisexual men |journal=Psychological science: APS |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=579–84 |year=2005 |pmid=16102058 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01578.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assertion of Bailey that "for men arousal is orientation" was criticized by [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR) as a simplification which neglects to account for behavior and self-identification.&lt;ref name="FAIR"&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Times Suggests Bisexuals Are 'Lying.'

===Symbols===
{{Main|LGBT symbols}}
[[File:Bi flag.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|The [[bisexual pride flag]].]]

A common symbol of the [[bisexual community]] is the [[bisexual pride flag]], which has a deep pink stripe at the top for homosexuality, a blue one on the bottom for heterosexuality, and a purple one – blending the pink and blue – in the middle to represent bisexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp |title=Bi Pride Flag |accessdate=16 February 2007 |author=Page, Michael |quote=The pink color represents sexual attraction to the same sex only, homosexuality, the blue represents sexual attraction to the opposite sex only, heterosexuality, and the resultant overlap color purple represents sexual attraction to both sexes (bi). |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129080614/http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp |archivedate=29 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:bi triangles.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|The overlapping triangles]]

Another symbol with a similarly symbolic color scheme is a pair of overlapping pink and blue triangles, forming purple or lavender where they intersect. This design is an expansion on the [[pink triangle]], a well-known symbol for the homosexual community.&lt;ref name="lambda symbols"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambda.org/symbols.htm |title=Symbols of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Movements |accessdate=27 February 2007 |date=26 December 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204072030/http://www.lambda.org/symbols.htm |archivedate=4 December 2004 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bisexual-moon-symbol.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|The double moon]]

Some bisexual individuals object to the use of a pink triangle, as it was the symbol that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s regime use to tag and persecute homosexuals. In response, a double crescent moon symbol was devised specifically to avoid the use of triangles.&lt;ref name="symbol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andrejkoymasky.com/lou/sym/sym05.html |title=Gay Symbols: Other Miscellaneous Symbols |accessdate=18 February 2007 |author=Koymasky, Matt |author2=Koymasky Andrej |date=14 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symbol is common in Germany and surrounding countries.&lt;ref name="symbol"/&gt;

Another symbol used for bisexuality is a purple diamond, conceptually derived from the intersection of two triangles, pink and blue (respectively), placed overlapping.

=== Within BDSM ===
In Steve Lenius' original 2001 paper, he explored the acceptance of bisexuality in a supposedly pansexual [[BDSM]] community. The reasoning behind this is that "coming-out" had become primarily the territory of the gay and lesbian, with bisexuals feeling the push to be one or the other (and being right only half the time either way). What he found in 2001, was that people in BDSM were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies they bring to the table, but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels. A decade later, Lenius (2011) looked back on his study and considered if anything has changed. He concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the BDSM and kink community was unchanged, and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society's changing views towards different sexualities and orientations. But Lenius (2011) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting BDSM community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lenius | first1 = S | year = 2001 | title = Bisexuals and BDSM | url = | journal = [[Journal of Bisexuality]] | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 69–78 | doi=10.1300/j159v01n04_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lenius | first1 = S | year = 2011 | title = A Reflection on "Bisexuals and BDSM: Bisexual People in a Pansexual Community"—Ten Years Later (and a Preview of the Next Sexual Revolution) | url = | journal = [[Journal of Bisexuality]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 420–425 | doi=10.1080/15299716.2011.620466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandy Lin Simula (2012), on the other hand, argues that BDSM actively resists gender conforming and identified three different types of BDSM bisexuality: [[Genderqueer|gender-switching]], gender-based styles (taking on a different gendered style depending on gender of partner when playing), and rejection of gender (resisting the idea that gender matters in their play partners). Simula (2012) explains that practitioners of BDSM routinely challenge our concepts of sexuality by pushing the limits on pre-existing ideas of sexual orientation and gender norms. For some, BDSM and kink provides a platform in creating identities that are fluid, ever-changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simula | first1 = B.

=== Within feminism ===
Feminist positions on bisexuality range greatly, from acceptance of bisexuality as a feminist issue to rejection of bisexuality as reactionary and anti-feminist [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] to [[lesbian feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Sue |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first=Lynne |editor1-last=Harne |editor1-link= |others=Elaine Miller |title=All the Rage: Reasserting Radical Lesbian Feminism |trans-title=|url= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year= 1996|month= |origyear= |publisher= [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teacher's College Press]]|location= New York City|isbn= 0-807-76285-7 |oclc= 35202923|doi= |id= |page= |pages=75–89 |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=Bisexuality as Backlash |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |author-mask= |display-authors= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of women who were at one time involved in lesbian-feminist activism have since come out as bisexual after realizing their attractions to men. A widely studied example of lesbian-bisexual conflict within feminism was the Northampton Pride March during the years between 1989 and 1993, where many feminists involved debated over whether bisexuals should be included and whether or not bisexuality was compatible with feminism.

Common lesbian-feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]], that bisexuality was a form of [[false consciousness]], and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were "deluded and desperate." Tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted within the feminist community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Routledge International Encyclopedia of Queer Culture|last= Gerstner|first= David A.|year= 2006|publisher= [[Routledge]]|location= United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-415-30651-5|page= |pages= 82–3|accessdate=3 October 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XS_SnVPixE8C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some lesbian feminists such as [[Julie Bindel]] are still critical of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a "fashionable trend" being promoted due to "sexual hedonism" and broached the question of whether bisexuality even exists.&lt;ref name="Bindel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-bindel/where-is-the-politics-in-_b_1589435.html |title=Where's the Politics in Sex? |publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-03 |first=Julie |last=Bindel |date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also made [[tongue-in-cheek]] comparisons of bisexuals to [[Animal fancy|cat fanciers]] and [[Satanism|devil worshippers]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/08/lesbianism |title=It's not me.

[[Donna Haraway]] was the inspiration and genesis for [[cyberfeminism]] with her 1985 essay "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" which was reprinted in ''Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature'' (1991). Haraway's essay states that the cyborg "has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labor, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/donna-haraway/articles/donna-haraway-a-cyborg-manifesto/ |title=Donna Haraway - A Cyborg Manifesto |publisher=Egs.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922114218/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/donna-haraway/articles/donna-haraway-a-cyborg-manifesto/ |archivedate=22 September 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the book ''Feminist Essays'' (2017) by Nancy Quinn Collins states that in the opinion of its author this "is wrong because bisexuality is a sexual orientation, a harmless attraction some people simply have, not something they try to have or do in order to create organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity.

Ancient Greeks and Romans did not associate sexual relations with binary labels, as modern Western society does. Men who had male lovers were not identified as homosexual, and may have had wives or other female lovers.

[[Ancient Greek]] religious texts, reflecting cultural practices, incorporated bisexual themes. The subtexts varied, from the mystical to the didactic.&lt;ref name="livius"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/ho-hz/homosexuality/homosexuality.html|title=Greek Homosexuality |accessdate=17 February 2007 |last=van Dolen |first=Hein}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sparta]]ns thought that love and erotic relationships between experienced and novice soldiers would solidify combat loyalty and [[unit cohesion]], and encourage heroic tactics as men vied to impress their lovers. Once the younger soldiers reached maturity, the relationship was supposed to become non-sexual, but it is not clear how strictly this was followed. There was some stigma attached to young men who continued their relationships with their mentors into adulthood.&lt;ref name="livius"/&gt; For example, [[Aristophanes]] calls them ''euryprôktoi'', meaning "wide arses", and depicts them like women.&lt;ref name="livius"/&gt;

Similarly, in [[ancient Rome]], gender did not determine whether a sexual partner was acceptable, as long as a man's enjoyment did not encroach on another's man integrity. It was expected and socially acceptable for a freeborn Roman man to want sex with both female and male partners, as long as he took the penetrative role.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; The morality of the behavior depended on the social standing of the partner, not gender ''per se''. Both women and young men were considered normal objects of desire, but outside marriage a man was supposed to act on his desires only with slaves, prostitutes (who were often slaves), and the ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]''. It was immoral to have sex with another freeborn man's wife, his marriageable daughter, his underage son, or with the man himself; sexual use of another man's slave was subject to the owner's permission. Lack of self-control, including in managing one's [[sex life]], indicated that a man was incapable of governing others; too much indulgence in "low sensual pleasure" threatened to erode the elite male's identity as a cultured person.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome," in ''Roman Sexualities'', pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
{{Main|Media portrayals of bisexuality}}

Bisexuality tends to be associated with negative media portrayals; references are sometimes made to stereotypes or mental disorders. In an article regarding the 2005 film ''Brokeback Mountain'', sex educator Amy Andre argued that in films, bisexuals are often depicted negatively:&lt;ref name="Andre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/article/opinion_bisexual_cowboys_love|title=Opinion: Bisexual Cowboys in Love|last=Andre|first=Amy|date=2005-12-16|publisher=[[National Sexuality Resource Center]]|accessdate=2006-11-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210122058/http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/article/opinion_bisexual_cowboys_love|archivedate=10 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I like movies where bisexuals come out to each other together and fall in love, because these tend to be so few and far between; the most recent example would be 2002's lovely romantic comedy, ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]''.

The bi love interest is usually deceptive (''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''), over-sexed (''[[The Sex Monster|Sex Monster]]''), unfaithful (''[[High Art]]''), and fickle (''[[Three of Hearts (1993 film)|Three of Hearts]]''), and might even be a serial killer, like Sharon Stone in ''[[Basic Instinct]]''. In other words, the bisexual is always the cause of the conflict in the film.|Amy Andre|''American Sexuality Magazine''}}

Using a content analysis of more than 170 articles written between 2001 and 2006, [[sociology|sociologist]] Richard N. Pitt, Jr. concluded that the media pathologized black bisexual men's behavior while either ignoring or sympathizing with white bisexual men's similar actions. He argued that the black bisexual man is often described as a ''duplicitous heterosexual'' man spreading the HIV/AIDS virus. Alternatively, the white bisexual man is often described in pitying language as a ''[[victimized]] homosexual'' man forced into the closet by the heterosexist society around him.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pitt Jr. | first1 = Richard N. | last2 =  | first2 =  | year = 2006 | title = Downlow Mountain?

In 1914 the first documented appearance of bisexual characters (female and male) in an American motion picture occurred in ''[[A Florida Enchantment]]'', by [[Sidney Drew]].&lt;ref name="glbtq_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/bisex_film.html |title=&gt;&gt; arts &gt;&gt; Bisexuality in Film |publisher=glbtq |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015093725/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/bisex_film.html |archivedate=15 October 2012 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the censorship required by the [[Hays Code]], the word ''bisexual'' could not be mentioned, and almost no bisexual characters appeared in American film from 1934 until 1968.&lt;ref name="glbtq_a" /&gt;

Notable and varying portrayals of bisexuality can be found in mainstream movies such as ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'' (2010), ''[[Frida]]'' (2002), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), ''[[The Pillow Book (film)|The Pillow Book]]'' (1996), ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'' (2004), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), ''[[Henry &amp; June]]'' (1990), ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997), ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]'' (1998), ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]'' (2001), ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]'' (1993), ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), ''[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (film)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]'' (1971), ''[[Something for Everyone (1970 film)|Something for Everyone]]'' (1970), ''[[The Rules of Attraction (film)|The Rules of Attraction]]'' (2002), ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005), and ''[[Call Me by Your Name (film)|Call Me by Your Name]]'' (2017).

=== Literature ===
[[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'' (1928) is an early example of bisexuality in literature. The story, of a man who changes into a woman without a second thought, was based on the life of Woolf's lover [[Vita Sackville-West]]. Woolf used the gender switch to avoid the book being banned for homosexual content. The pronouns switch from male to female as Orlando's gender changes. Woolf's lack of definite pronouns allows for ambiguity and lack of emphasis on gender labels.&lt;ref name="livia"&gt;Livia, Anna (2000). ''Pronoun Envy: Literary Uses of Linguistic Gender.'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|9780195138535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her 1925 book ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' focused on a bisexual man and a bisexual woman in sexually unfulfilled heterosexual marriages in later life. Following Sackille-West's death, her son [[Nigel Nicolson]] published ''[[Portrait of a Marriage]]'', one of her diaries recounting her affair with a woman during her marriage to [[Harold Nicolson]]. Other early examples include works of [[D.H. Lawrence]], such as ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1920), and [[Colette]]'s ''[[Claudine à l'école|Claudine]]'' (1900–1903) series.

The main character in [[Patrick White]]'s novel, ''[[The Twyborn Affair]]'' (1979), is bisexual. Contemporary novelist [[Bret Easton Ellis]]' novels, such as ''[[Less Than Zero (novel)|Less Than Zero]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'' (1987) frequently feature bisexual male characters; this "casual approach" to bisexual characters recurs throughout Ellis' work.&lt;ref name="badboy"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/music-and-books/201006/author-bret-easton-ellis-less-than-zero-sequel-imperial-bedrooms|title=Bret Easton Ellis: Eternal Bad Boy|work=[[Details (magazine)|Details]]|last=Gordinier|first=Jeff|date=June 2010|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
Rock musician [[David Bowie]] famously declared himself bisexual in an interview with ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in January 1972, a move coinciding with the first shots in his campaign for stardom as [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Roy; Murray, Charles Shaar (1981). Bowie: An Illustrated Record. New York: Avon. {{ISBN|0-380-77966-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a September 1976 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', Bowie said, "It's true—I am a bisexual.

I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners or be a representative of any group of people. I knew what I wanted to be, which was a songwriter and a performer [...]  America is a very puritanical place, and I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collis |first=Clark |title=Dear Superstar: David Bowie |work=blender.com |publisher=Alpha Media Group Inc |date=August 2002 |accessdate=16 September 2010 |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=366 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510103103/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=366 |archivedate=10 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen singer [[Freddie Mercury]] was also open about his bisexuality, though did not publicly discuss his relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/freddie-mercury-9406228|title=Freddie Mercury|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[Jill Sobule]] sang about [[bi-curious|bi-curiosity]] in her song "I Kissed a Girl", with a video that alternated images of Sobule and a boyfriend along with images of her with a girlfriend. Another [[I Kissed a Girl (Katy Perry song)|song with the same name]] by [[Katy Perry]] also hints at the same theme. Some activists suggest the song merely reinforces the stereotype of bisexuals experimenting and of bisexuality not being a real sexual preference. [[Lady Gaga]] has also stated that she is bisexual,&lt;ref name="RollStone"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/27/the-new-issue-of-rolling-stone-the-rise-of-lady-gaga |title=Lady Gaga Rolling Stone Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has acknowledged that her song "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" is about fantasizing about a woman while being with a man.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iviewtube.com/videos/111677/lady-gaga-admits-bisexuality-interview-on-barbara-walters|title=Lady Gaga admits bisexuality and explains "Poker Face" to Barbra Walters|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217041020/http://www.iviewtube.com/videos/111677/lady-gaga-admits-bisexuality-interview-on-barbara-walters|archivedate=17 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I mean, it's something that I've always been interested in. I think people are born bisexual, and it's just that our parents and society kind of veer us off into this feeling of 'Oh, I can't.'

There are these other feelings you may have about the same sex, the opposite sex, especially being in Berkeley and San Francisco then. People are acting out what they're feeling: gay, bisexual, transgender, whatever. And that opens up something in society that becomes more acceptable. Now we have gay marriage becoming recognized...

In the [[BBC]] TV science fiction show ''[[Torchwood]]'', several of the main characters appear to have fluid sexuality. Most prominent among these is [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], a pansexual who is the lead character and an otherwise conventional science fiction action hero.

Many non-human animal species exhibit bisexual behavior.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Evol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bi Species"/&gt; Examples of mammals that display such behavior include the [[bonobo]] (formerly known as the pygmy chimpanzee), [[orca]], and the [[bottlenose dolphin]].&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Evol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bi Species"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milton"/&gt; Examples of birds include some species of gulls and [[Humboldt penguin]]s. Other examples of bisexual behavior occur among fish and [[flatworm]]s.&lt;ref name="Milton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/bisdia.htm |title=Bisexuality: A Biological Perspective |accessdate=17 February 2007 |author=Diamond, Milton |year=1998 |work=Bisexualities&amp;nbsp;– The Ideology and Practice of Sexual Contact with both Men and Women |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101000138/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/bisdia.htm |archivedate=1 January 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many species of animals are involved in the acts of forming sexual and non-sexual relationship bonds between the same sex; even when offered the opportunity to breed with members of the opposite sex, they pick the same sex. Some of these species are [[gazelle]]s, [[antelope]], [[bison]], and [[sage grouse]].&lt;ref name=Bidstrup&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bidstrup.com/sodomy.htm |title=The Natural Crime Against Nature |accessdate=26 June 2007 |author=Scott Bidstrup |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, animals will choose to engage in sexual activity with different sexes at different times in their lives, and will sometimes engage in sexual activity with different sexes at random. Same-sex sexual activity can also be seasonal in some animals, like male walruses who often engage in same-sex sexual activity with each other outside of the breeding season and will revert to heterosexual sexual activity during breeding season.&lt;ref name=Bidstrup/&gt;

A '''closed-ended question''' refers to any question for which a researcher provides research participants with options from which to choose a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-open-ended-and-closed-ended-questions.html|website=''yourdictionary.com''|publisher=yourdictionary.com|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open-ended questions are sometimes phrased as a [[Declarative sentence|statement]] which requires a response.

A closed-ended question contrasts with an [[open-ended question]], which cannot easily be answered with specific information.

Examples of close-ended questions which may elicit a "yes" or "no" response include:
*Were you born in {{CURRENTYEAR}}?
*Is [[Lyon]] the capital of France?
*Did you steal the money?

Similarly, variants of the above close-ended questions which possess specific responses are:
*On what day were you born? ("[[{{CURRENTWEEKDAYNAME}}]].")
*What is the capital of France? ("Paris.")
*Where did you steal the money? ("From the bank.")

At the same time, there are closed-ended questions which are sometimes impossible to answer correctly with a yes or no without confusion, for example: "Have you stopped taking heroin?" (if you never took it) or "Who told you to take heroin?"; see "[[loaded question]]".

A study by the [[University of Cincinnati]] found 20 to 40 percent of Americans will provide an opinion when they do not have one because of [[social pressure]], using [[Contextual learning|context clues]] to select an answer they believe will please the questioner. A classic example of this phenomenon was the 1947 study of the fictional [[Metallic Metals Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kivitv.com/-/the-bomb-agrabah-survey-shows-how-problematic-polling-can-be |title=The 'Bomb Agrabah' Survey Shows How Problematic Polling Can Be |last=Daniels |first=Eugene |date=18 December 2015 |publisher=[[KIVI-TV]] |access-date= 17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closed-ended questions in education ==
Some in the field of education argue that closed-ended questions are broadly speaking "bad" questions. They are questions that are often asked to obtain a specific answer and are therefore good for testing knowledge. It is often argued that open-ended questions (i.e. questions that elicit more than a yes/no answers) are preferable because they open up discussion and enquiry.

Peter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley’s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are "grammatically closed, but conceptually open".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=3 December 2016|title=Ariadne's Clew Absence and presence in the facilitation of philosophical conversations|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1350/870|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v3i2.1350|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in standard parlance, "is it ever right to lie?" would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes–no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes–no answer to it can be "opened up" by the questioner ("why do you think that?", "Could there be an instance where that's not the case?), inviting elaboration and enquiry.

This grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, "gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/question-your-questioning|title=Question your questioning|date=19 April 2017|work=Tes|access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed questions, simply require "opening up" strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential.

Worley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention "Open Questioning Mindset" (OQM). OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of student's contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genuine enquiry in the classroom. It provides teachers with the tools to move beyond what Worley calls "guess what's in my head" teaching, that relies on closed and leading questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=29 November 2015|title=Open thinking, closed questioning: Two kinds of open and closed question|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1269|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v2i2.1269|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Computer Science''' is a department of the [[Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics]] at the [[Comenius University]] in [[Bratislava]], the capital of [[Slovakia]]. It is headed by Prof. RNDr. [[Branislav Rovan]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Phd]].

== Educational and scientific achievements ==

The first comprehensive computer science curriculum in [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Slovakia]]) was introduced at the Faculty in 1973. The department, established in 1974, continues to be responsible for organizing the major part of the undergraduate and graduate computer science education to this date. The distinguishing feature of the curriculum has been a balanced coverage of the mathematical foundations, theoretical computer science, and practical computer science. The part of the curriculum covered by the department at present includes courses on computer architecture, system software, networks, databases, software design, design and analysis of algorithms, formal languages, computational complexity, discrete mathematics, cryptology, data security and others.

The department succeeded several times in project applications within the TEMPUS Programme of the [[European Union|EU]]. The projects CIPRO and „Neumann Network“ helped to build the departmental hardware infrastructure and to establish the expertise in Unix workstation technology, networking, and structured document processing. The CUSTU PARLAB parallel computing laboratory run jointly with the Department of Informatics of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the [[Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava|Slovak Technical University]] also resulted from one of these projects. Furthermore, the department participated in project LEARN-ED under the COPERNICUS Programme and built a multimedia laboratory.

The department has been involved in the organization of one of the top European conferences in theoretical computer science ? MFCS ? each time it took place in Slovakia. Further conferences recently organized or co-organized by the department include SOFSEM '98 and DISC '99. Besides, the department houses the secretariat of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science, of the Slovak Society for Computer Science and of the Association for Security of Information Technologies (ASIT).

== Research topics ==

Research in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics has the longest tradition in the department. Most notably, the result of [[Róbert Szelepcsényi]] on the closure of nondeterministic space under complement, independently obtained also by N. Immerman, brought the [[Gödel Prize]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] and [[EATCS]] to both of them in 1995. More recently research in parallel and distributed computing, cryptology and information security, and in software development has been initiated. The department is involved in international cooperation on the development of the structured document editor within the Euromath Project. 
The department has many international contacts, succeeded in research project application (project ALTEC ? „Algorithms for Future Technologies“) with partners from EU, and also has two research grants from the Slovak Grant Agency.

== Technical equipment ==

A network consisting of 20 workstations ([[Sun Microsystems|Sun]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]] in two workstation labs), Parsytec (with 20 [[transputer]]s and OS Parix), and standard PCs connected to a network.

'''Flavius Dioscorus''' ({{lang-el|Φλαύϊος Διόσκορος}} ''Flauios Dioskoros'') lived during the 6th century A.D. in the village of [[Per-Wadjet (Upper Egypt)|Aphrodito]], [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], and therefore is called by modern scholars '''Dioscorus of Aphrodito'''.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was an Egyptian, he composed poetry in [[Byzantine literature|Greek]], the cultural language of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Era]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; His poems are the oldest surviving poems written by the hand of a known poet.&lt;ref&gt;Parca 1991, 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts, which contain his corrections and revisions, were discovered on [[papyrus]] in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;Maspero 1911, pp. 454–456.&lt;/ref&gt; and are now held in museums and libraries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan 1984a, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Dioscorus was also occupied in [[Roman law|legal work]], and legal documents and drafts involving him, his family, Aphroditans, and others were discovered along with his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, p. 4; [[Jean-Luc Fournet|Fournet]]-Magdelaine 2008, pp. 310–343.&lt;/ref&gt; As an administrator of the village of Aphrodito, he composed petitions on behalf of its citizens, which are unique for their poetic and religious qualities.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 16–19 and ff.; Kovelman 1991, pp. 138–148; Kuehn 1995, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Dioscorus was a Christian (a [[Copts|Copt]]) and lived in a [[Coptic monasticism|religiously active environment]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 5–7; Kuehn 1995, pp. 56–58.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of Greek and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] papyri associated with Dioscorus and Aphrodito is one of the most important finds in the history of [[papyrology]] and has shed considerable light on the law and society of Byzantine Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Bell-Crum 1925, p. 177; Kuehn 1995, p. 47; Ruffini 2008, pp. 150–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Papyrus ==
The papyri of Dioscorus were discovered by accident in July 1905 in the village of Kom Ashkaw (also called Kom Ishgau, Kom Ishqaw, etc.), which was built above the ancient site of Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre 1907, pp. viii–xi.&lt;/ref&gt; An inhabitant was renovating his home when a wall collapsed and revealed a chasm below. Papyrus rolls and fragments were seen in the crevice, but by the time the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities|Antiquities Service]] was notified and arrived, most of the papyrus was gone. During subsequent excavations, a large jar filled with papyrus was discovered in a Roman-style house. Important fragments of [[Ancient Greek comedy|Athenian Comedy]], both Old and New, were discovered among these papyri, including fragments of the famous comedy writer [[Menander]].&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre 1907, 1911; Gomme-Sandbach 1973; Koenen 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also fragments of Homer's [[Iliad]] and other literary works and reference works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Luc Fournet|Fournet]] 1999, pp. 9–237; Fournet-Magdelaine 2008, pp. 309–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jean Maspero.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Maspero]], editor of the first collection of Dioscorian poems (1911)]]

Most importantly, the excavator Gustave Lefebvre unearthed an archive of sixth-century legal, business, and personal papers, and original poetry. These were turned over to the young scholar Jean Maspero, son of the Director of the Antiquities Service of Egypt, who edited and published the documents and poems in several journal articles &lt;ref&gt;Maspero 1908–1910, 1910, 1911, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; and two volumes of the ''Catalogue général des antiquités égyptiennes du Musée du Caire: Papyrus grecs d’époque byzantine'' (Cairo 1911, 1913). Jean was killed in the battle at Vauquois on the Lorraine during [[World War I]], and his father Gaston completed the third volume of Dioscorian papyri in 1916. Other Dioscorian papyri, obtained by antiquities dealers through sales and clandestine excavations,&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Maspero, intro. to P.Cair.Masp. III, p. viii; Keenan 1984a, pp. 52–53, and 2009, p. 66; Gagos-van Minnen 1994, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; were published in Florence, London, Paris, Strasbourg, Princeton, [[University of Michigan Papyrus Collection|Ann Arbor]], the Vatican, etc.&lt;ref&gt;See note 5 above.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aphrodito ==
The village of Kom Ashkaw is in [[Geography of Egypt|Middle Egypt]], south of Cairo and north of Luxor. It was originally an Egyptian city, but after [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Egypt in 332 B.C., it was given the Greek name "Aphroditopolis" (“The City of [[Aphrodite]]”) and was made the capital city of its ''[[Nome (Egypt)|nome]]'' (an administrative district, like a US county). Before the 6th century, however, [[Aphroditopolis Nome|Aphroditopolis]] lost its status as a city, and the capital of the ''nome'' was moved across the Nile River to [[Antaeopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, p. 6; Kuehn 1995, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; The village of Aphrodito and the city of Antaeopolis were part of a larger, merged administrative district called the [[Thebaid]], which was under the jurisdiction of a ''[[dux|doux]]'', appointed by the [[Byzantine Emperor]]. The ''doux'' had his administrative center in [[Antinopolis|Antinoopolis]] on the east bank of the [[Nile|Nile River]].&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall-Rathbone 2004, pp. 169–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mother of God (portrayed as a Byzantine empress).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|''Theotokos.'' Coptic tapestry. Cleveland.&lt;br /&gt;6th century representation of the Mother of God as a Byzantine Empress.]]

Aphrodito was situated in an environment that was highly poetic and religious. [[Nonnus]], the most influential poet of the Early Byzantine Era (A.D. 300–700), had come from Panopolis, 42&amp;nbsp;km. southeast of Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron 2007; pp. 34–39; Cavero 2008, pp. 15–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Other poets from the Thebaid had not only become celebrities—such as [[Musaeus Grammaticus]], Colluthus, and Christodorus—but also were part of a poetic revolution of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron 1965 passim; MacCoull 1988, pp. 59–61; Cavero 2008, pp. 25–105.&lt;/ref&gt; These poets, though Egyptians, wrote their verses in the Greek dialect of [[Homer]], who had composed his Iliad and Odyssey more than a thousand years before them. Perhaps one of the reasons for this movement was to usurp the pagan vocabulary and style of the most honored ancient poet for Christian purposes. Dioscorus continued and developed this revolution by writing [[Encomium|encomiastic poems]] (poems of praise) in an Homeric style.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1985, p. 9; Fournet 1999, pp. 673–675.&lt;/ref&gt; The community was also active religiously. According to the New Testament, Egypt was the first home of [[Flight into Egypt|young Jesus and his family]].&lt;ref&gt;Mt 2:13–21.&lt;/ref&gt; And according to [[Church Fathers|Patristic literature]], Egypt was the birthplace of [[Christian monasticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Athanasius, Life of Antony.&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Egypt, the areas of [[Nitria (monastic site)|Nitria]], [[Kellia]], and [[Wadi El Natrun|Wadi Natrun]] contained large monastic centers that attracted devout followers from both the Eastern and Western halves of the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall-Rathbone 2004, pp. 107–115.&lt;/ref&gt; In southern Egypt, one of the first Christian monasteries was established at [[Pachomius|Pbow]], 127&amp;nbsp;km. southeast of Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;Gascou 1976, pp. 157–184; Rousseau 1985 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 40&amp;nbsp;km. south of Aphrodito was the [[White Monastery]], founded by the vigorous Coptic monk [[Shenoute]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmel 2004 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; The father of Dioscorus himself, Apollos, established and later entered his own monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Gascou 1981, pp. 219–230.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Aphrodito and its vicinity “boasted over thirty churches and nearly forty monasteries.”&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

===Early years===
There is no surviving record for the early years of Dioscorus. His father Apollos was an entrepreneur and local official.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan 1984b passim; Kuehn 1995, pp. 54–58.&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly accepted date for the birth of Dioscorus is around A.D. 520.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero 1911, p. 457; MacCoull 1988, p. 9; Kuehn 1995, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no evidence, it is likely that Dioscorus went to school in [[Alexandria]], where one of his teachers might have been the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[John Philoponus]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1987 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Alexandria was not the most prominent place for a legal education – that was the city of [[Beirut]] – young men did travel there for rhetorical training preliminary to the study of law.&lt;ref&gt;Cribiore 2007, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; These included the celebrated poet [[Agathias]], a contemporary of Dioscorus, who at an early age published a successful collection of poems called the Cycle and later became the center of a circle of prominent poets in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan and Averil Cameron 1966, pp. 8–10; Averil Cameron 1970 1–11, 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Aphrodito, Dioscorus married, had children, and pursued a career similar to his father's: acquiring, leasing out, and managing property, and helping in the administration of the village.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan 1988, p. 173; Kuehn 1995, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; His first dated appearance in the papyrus is 543. Dioscorus had the assistant of the ''[[defensor civitatis]]'' of Antaeopolis examine the damage done by a shepherd and his flock to a field of crops, which was owned by the Monastery of Apa Sourous but managed by Dioscorus.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. I 67087; Keenan 1985, pp. 245–259.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constantinople===
[[Image:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''Empress Theodora.'' Mosaic. San Vitale, Ravenna.&lt;br /&gt;6th century representation of the Empress Theodora.]]

Dioscorus also became engaged in legal work. In 546/7, after his father Apollos died, Dioscorus wrote a formal petition to [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] and a formal explanation to [[Theodora (wife of Justinian I)|Empress Theodora]] about tax conflicts affecting Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. I 67019 v, and P.Cair.Masp. III 67283.&lt;/ref&gt; The village was under the special patronage of the Empress,&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, intro. to P.Cair.Masp. III 67283, pp. 15–17; Bell 1944, p. 31; Keenan 1984a, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and had been granted the status of ''autopragia''.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, p. 53 note 58.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the village could collect its own public taxes and deliver them directly to the imperial treasury. Aphrodito was not under the jurisdiction of the [[pagarch]], stationed in Antaeopolis, who handled the public taxes for the rest of the ''nome''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Gascou|Gascou]] 1972, pp. 60–72; Liebeschuetz 1973, pp. 38–46, and 1974, pp. 163–168.&lt;/ref&gt; Dioscorus's petition and explanation to the imperial palace described the pagarch's violations of their special tax status, including theft of the collected tax money.

The communications to Constantinople seem to have had little effect, and in 551 (three years after the death of Theodora), Dioscorus travelled with a contingency of Aphroditans to Constantinople to present the problem to the Emperor directly. Dioscorus may have spent three years in the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Salomon 1948, pp. 98 – 108; Fournet 1999, pp. 318 – 321.&lt;/ref&gt; In poetry, the city was very active. Not only was [[Agathias]] now writing there, but also [[Paul the Silentiary]] and [[Romanus the Melodist]]. In respect to the Aphroditans' tax problems, Dioscorus was able to obtain an imperial rescript, three copies of which have survived in his archive.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. I 67024 r, v, and 67025.&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor instructs the Duke of the Thebaid to investigate and, if justified, to stop the aggressions of the pagarch. There is no evidence of further tax violations by the pagarch until after the death of Justinian in 565.

===Antinoopolis===

[[Image:Petersinai.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''St. Peter.'' Encaustic icon. Sinai.&lt;br /&gt;6th century representation of St. Peter as a Roman consul.]]

In 565/6 Dioscorus left Aphrodito for Antinoopolis, the capital city of the Thebaid and the residence of the ''doux''.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 11–12; Kuehn 1995, p. 66.
&lt;/ref&gt; He remained there for about seven years. His motivation for the move is nowhere made clear. But surmising from the surviving documents, one can conclude that he was attracted by the opportunity to advance his legal career in the proximity of the Duke and likewise was compelled by the increasing violence of the pagarch against Aphrodito and his own family.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; The legal documents from that period show that Dioscorus wrote the final will for the Surgeon General (Phoebammon),&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. II 67151 and 67152.&lt;/ref&gt; arbitrated in family property disputes,&lt;ref&gt;Bell, P.Lond. V 1708.&lt;/ref&gt; composed marriage and divorce contracts,&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1993, pp. 103–106, and 1995, p. 70 note 153.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued writing petitions about the offenses of the pagarch. One such petition, P.Cair.Masp. I 67002, describes how a group of Aphroditans on their way to the annual cattle market were ambushed. They were eventually put into a prison in Antaeopolis, under the control of the pagarch Menas, where they were tortured and robbed and their animals were seized. Menas and his men then attacked the village of Aphrodito itself: he blocked the [[Bahr Yussef|irrigation]], extorted money, burned down homes, and violated the nuns. All these crimes were committed in the name of collecting the public taxes, although Aphrodito had never failed a payment and Menas had no right to collect them. A formal explanation, P.Lond. V 1677, describes the attacks by Menas on Dioscorus himself and his family. He seized property owned by Dioscorus and transferred it to his assistants, leaving Dioscorus with only the tax liability. Menas proceeded to pillage the home of Dioscorus's brother-in-law and seized his land too, reducing him and his family to poverty. He then arrested Dioscorus's own son.

Before May 574, Dioscorus left Antinoopolis.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, p. 14; Kuehn 1995, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for his departure is not explained. It might have been related to domestic affairs, to his career, or to the changed situation in Constantinople. The violent crimes against Aphrodito and Dioscorus (described above) were committed under the reign of [[Justin II]], who had launched a savage persecution of Christians that did not adhere to [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedonian]] dogmas, including [[Monophysitism|Egyptian Copts]]. But Justin went completely insane and abdicated, and in 574, [[Tiberius II Constantine|Tiberius]] and Empress [[Sophia (empress)|Sophia]], the wife of Justin, took over the management of the Byzantine Empire.

=== Return to Aphrodito ===

Back home in Aphrodito, it seems that Dioscorus withdrew from legal affairs and administrative responsibilities. Much of his poetry was composed during his stay in Antinoopolis or after he had returned to Aphrodito.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 13–14; Kuehn 1995, pp. 73, 75–76; Fournet 1999, pp. 321–324.&lt;/ref&gt; His documents now focus on mundane, rural activities. His last dated document, a land lease written by his hand in an account book, is April 5, 585.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, P.Cair.Masp. III 67325 IV r 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
Dioscorus might have recited his poems and circulated them locally, but there is no evidence that they were ever published during his lifetime. Jean Maspero published the first collection of Dioscorian poems in 1911: “Un dernier poète grec d’Égypte: Dioscore, fils d’Apollôs.”&lt;ref&gt;Revue des études grecques 24: 426–81.&lt;/ref&gt; This journal article included the texts of 13 poems, French translations, and an analysis of the style. Then between 1911 and 1916, Jean and Gaston Maspero republished the poems along with Dioscorian documents in three volumes of ''Papyrus grecs d'époque byzantine''.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue général des antiquités égyptiennes du Musée du Caire: Papyrus grecs d’époque byzantine, 3 vols. (Cairo, 1911–1916). [P.Cair.Masp. I–III]&lt;/ref&gt; These poems were all part of the papyrus collection owned by the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]]. In 1962, Ernst Heitsch published 29 Dioscorian poems that were among papyrus fragments held in a variety of museums and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Die griechischen Dichterfragmente der römischen Kaiserzeit, Vol. 1, 2nd edn. (Göttingen, 1963); Vol. 2 (Göttingen, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt; For over thirty-five years, this was the authoritative edition. The most comprehensive edition at the present time is by [[Jean-Luc Fournet]], who in 1999 published 51 Dioscorian poems and fragments (including 2 that he considered of dubious authenticity).&lt;ref&gt;Hellénisme dans l’Égypte du VIe siècle. La bibliothèque et l’œuvre de Dioscore d’Aphrodité [MIFAO 115], 2 vols. (Cairo 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the texts and commentaries offered by Maspero, Heitsch, [[Jean-Luc Fournet|Fournet]], and the initial editors of other poems, a comprehensive study of his poetry was published by Leslie MacCoull in 1988: ''Dioscorus of Aphrodito: His Work and His World'' (Berkeley). Clement Kuehn published a reinterpretation of his poetry in 1995: ''Channels of Imperishable Fire: The Beginnings of Christian Mystical Poetry and Dioscorus of Aphrodito'' (New York).

===Interpretations===
The reactions by modern readers to his poetry have varied widely. The papyrologists and historians that first examined them were not impressed. Influenced by their backgrounds in [[List of Ancient Greek poets|Classical poetry]], they compared the Dioscorian verses primarily to Classical standards. The most frequent objection was that his verses were obscure: the editors thought that the lines did not make sense – or at least, were not saying what the editors expected them to say.&lt;ref&gt;“Le style de Dioscore fait pauvre figure” (Maspero 1911, p. 472; cf. 427). “At no moment has he any real control of thought, diction, grammar, metre, or meaning” (Milne 1927, p. 68). “So ist doch selbst dort, wo der Text heil zu sein scheint, der Gedankengang nicht immer verständlich” (Heitsch 1963, p. 16 note 1).&lt;/ref&gt; A more positive assessment was offered by Leslie MacCoull, who insisted that a reader must take Dioscorus’s Coptic background into consideration when reading the poetry.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoull 1988, pp. 57–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the poems seemed to be praising unknown dignitaries – including an Emperor and several Dukes – and some papyrologists concluded that Dioscorus wrote the poems to get favors from government administrators (whom the papyrologists vaguely and inconsistently identified).&lt;ref&gt;“C’est que, pour Dioscore, la poésie semble ne se concevoir que dans l’adversité : elle est destinée à obtenir, non à donner” (Fournet 1999, p. 325).&lt;/ref&gt; Clement Kuehn, however, proposed that the poems be viewed not from a Classical, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], or even a strictly [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian]] perspective,&lt;ref&gt;“To be sure, most of these poems are not great works of literature, especially when compared with their illustrious classical models” (Gagos-van Minnen 1994, p. 20).&lt;/ref&gt; but through a lens of [[Byzantine literature|Byzantine culture]] and [[Christian mysticism|spirituality]], in which Dioscorus and the Thebaid were so deeply immersed. Kuehn demonstrated that the poems fit neatly and masterfully into the [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|allegorical style]] that was pervasive in the pictoral art and literature of the Early Byzantine Era.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann 1978, pp. 40–55; Lamberton 1986 passim; Dawson 1992 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; That is: Dioscorus, influenced by allegorical commentaries on the [[Homeric scholarship|Homeric epics]] and Bible, and by the allegorical icons and church art of the [[Byzantine art|6th century]], was praising Christ, Old Testament patriarchs, and the saints in heaven as if they were the Emperor, kings, and dignitaries in a Byzantine court.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 1995, pp. 2, 156, and passim; Kuehn 2011, pp. 9–12 (“Introduction”).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Donkey punch''' is a [[slang]] term for the [[Human sexual activity|sexual practice]] of inflicting [[blunt trauma|blunt force trauma]] to the back of the head or lower back of the receiving partner during [[anal sex|anal]] or vaginal sex as an attempt by the penetrating partner to induce involuntary tightening of [[internal anal sphincter|internal]] or [[external anal sphincter]] muscles or vaginal passage of the receiving partner.&lt;ref name="AETC"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tate2007"/&gt; According to Dr. Jeffrey Bahr of [[Medical College of Wisconsin]], there is no reflex in humans that would cause such tensing in response to a blow on the head, although striking a partner on the back of the neck or head could cause severe, even lethal injury.&lt;ref name=savage&gt;{{cite news |title=Donkey See, Donkey Doo |author=Dan Savage |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=93682 |newspaper=The Stranger |date=October 26, 2006 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Urban legend ==
Sex columnist [[Dan Savage]] has discussed the alleged practice on several occasions. In 2004, Savage referred to the donkey punch as "a sex act that exists only in the imaginations of adolescent boys,"&lt;ref name="savage2004"&gt;{{cite news |title=No Shit? |author=Dan Savage |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=20179&amp;mode=print |newspaper=The Stranger |date=December 23–29, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding "no one has ever attempted "[[Pirate (sexual slang)|the Pirate]]," just as no one has ever performed a [[Hot Karl (slang)|Hot Karl]], delivered a Donkey Punch, or inserted an Icy Mike. They’re all fictions."&lt;ref name="savage2004"/&gt; Responding to an enquiry from Wikipedia editors, he again discussed the donkey punch urban legend in his "[[Savage Love]]" column in 2006. He wrote, "attempting a Donkey Punch can lead to ... unpleasant outcomes," including "injury, death or incarceration"; he also pointed out that it "doesn't even work." He quoted Jeffrey Bahr, a faculty member at the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]],&lt;ref name=savage/&gt;
{{quote|To the best of my knowledge, there is no definitive reflex in the human neurophysiology that induces involuntary tightening of the anal sphincter after receiving blunt force trauma to the occiput, or back of the head. ... Trauma to any part of the head can have serious ramifications. Pain, intracranial hemorrhage, memory loss, neck injury, and possibly some related sensory deficits in the arms and legs. A strong enough blow to the back of an unsuspecting person's head could result in a vertebral fracture which, I hope most people know, could cause paralysis or even death.}}
Jordan Tate, commenting in ''The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms'' (2007) on the "almost purely theoretical nature" of the term, claimed,&lt;ref name="Tate2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jordan Tate|title=The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aclMh6SB1ngC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=15 February 2012|date=9 January 2007|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-36298-0|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The donkey punch originated in the late twentieth century sometime after the sexual revolution, when the empowerment of women was threatening the place of men in contemporary society. This shift in gender paradigms left men feeling threatened, and to reassert their authority, they created and popularized these theoretical and violent euphemisms. ...

''The concise new Partridge dictionary of slang and unconventional English'' (2007) defines the term as follows:&lt;ref name="PartridgeDalzell2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Partridge|author2=Tom Dalzell|author3=Terry Victor|title=The concise new Partridge dictionary of slang and unconventional English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cCVnlIUTpg4C&amp;pg=PA211|accessdate=10 February 2012|date=1 November 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-21259-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pornography ==
[[File:Gia Paloma, September 2006.JPG|thumb|Gia Paloma is credited as the first recipient of a donkey punch in a pornographic film]]
The adult film star credited as the first known recipient of a donkey punch is Gia Paloma, who had the act performed on her by [[Alex Sanders (pornographic actor)|Alex Sanders]] in the 2004 film ''Gutter Mouths 30''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avn.com/porn-stars/Gia-Paloma-263487.html|title = Gia Paloma|publisher = Adult Video News|website = avn.com|accessdate = 8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Donkey Punch (pornographic film)|Donkey Punch]]'', a pornographic film premised around the act, was released by [[JM Productions]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{iafd title|Donkey+Punch|2005|Donkey Punch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film consists of four scenes in which the male actors engage in [[rough sex]] with their female co-stars, punching them repeatedly in the head and body throughout. In response to her experience on the set, performer Alex Divine allegedly stated "''Donkey Punch'' was the most brutal, depressing, scary scene that I have ever done,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.xbiz.com/articles/15635|title = Hardcore Content: 1|last = Cachapero|first = Joanne|publisher = [[XBIZ]]|date = 22 June 2006|website = xbiz.com|accessdate = 8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commented that "I actually stopped the scene while it was being filmed because I was in too much pain."

The viciousness of the film prompted Peter van Aarle of Cyberspace Adult Video Reviews to forego covering any further releases from JM, while Zack Parsons of [[Something Awful]] (which awarded ''Donkey Punch'' a score of -49, where -50 is the worst score possible) wrote that the film was "one of the most morally repugnant pornographic movies I have seen" and "is the sort of movie that the government would cite when trying to arrest pornographers and outlaw pornography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cavr.com/xxx17944.htm|title = ''Donkey Punch''|publisher = Cyberspace Adult Video Reviews|date = 12 September 2005|website = cavr.com|accessdate = 8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.somethingawful.com/horrors-of-porn/donkey-punch/|title = ''Donkey Punch''|last = Parsons|first = Zach|publisher = [[Something Awful]]|date = 22 June 2006|website = somethingawful.com|accessdate = 8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enron scandal ==
"Donkey punch" was one of several slang terms used by [[Enron]] traders to refer to their [[price gouging]] methods.&lt;ref name="chron"&gt;{{cite news |title=When Enron pushed, utility pushed back |author=Carolyn Said |url=http://www.chron.com/business/enron/article/When-Enron-pushed-utility-pushed-back-1676193.php |newspaper=[[The Houston Chronicle]] |date=June 27, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During investigations into the 2004 [[Enron scandal]] over manipulation of the electricity market in [[California]], recordings of Enron traders were uncovered dating from 2000 and 2001. In the recordings, fraudulent accounting schemes were referred to using slang terms, including "Donkey Punch."&lt;ref name="chron"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New evidence of Enron schemes |author=Zachary Coile |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ffile%3D/chronicle/archive/2004/06/15/MNGNJ76B111.DTL |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=June 15, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Senator: Federal Web site hosts pornographic Enron e-mails |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/senator-federal-web-site-hosts-pornographic-enron-e-mails |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |date=June 19, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://swap.stanford.edu/20140329172207/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/senator-federal-web-site-hosts-pornographic-enron-e-mails |archivedate=March 29, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unveiling the Corporate Greed Market |author=Jim Hightower |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/19483/unveiling_the_corporate_greed_market/?page=entire |newspaper=[[AlterNet]] |date=August 7, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2007 report by the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] was unable to identify the meaning that Enron had attached to the term "Donkey Punch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Strategic behaviour in network industries: a multidisciplinary approach | author = Ernst F.

Cantwell asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take down the emails that were on its website due to the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Federal Energy Regulatory Commission web site hosts pornographic Enron emails: Cantwell says federal agency not doing its homework and should remove the offensive content |url=http://cantwell.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=242397&amp; |publisher=[[Maria Cantwell]] |date=June 17, 2004 |accessdate=February 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309155002/http://cantwell.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=242397&amp; |archivedate=March 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Jeopardy!'' ==
The term received extensive coverage online after it was mistakenly given as an answer on the January 16, 2012 broadcast of the American game show ''[[Jeopardy!]]''. The prompt was "A blow to the back of the neck is the punch named for this animal"; the correct answer was [[rabbit punch]], a dangerous boxing move. The first contestant answered with "What is a donkey?" The subsequent contestant gave the correct answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='What is a donkey punch?'

== History ==
e-Types was founded in Vesterbro, Copenhagen, in 1997 by a team of young graphic designers. Over the past decade e-Types has developed from a business of 5 employees into a consultancy of 50 strategists, designers and account managers. In 2010 e-Types became part of [[e-Types Group]].

The company's branding work includes [[Danish Film Institute]] (1999), [[Aquascutum]] (2002), [[Rzeczpospolita]] (2004), [[Royal Danish Theatre]] (2005), [[3XN]] (2007), [[CPH:PIX]] (2008), [[Dansk Industri|DI]] (2008), [[Tryg]] (2010), [[Berlingske]] (2011), [[Sanoma]] (2013).&lt;ref&gt;[http://e-types.com/35305/ e-Types&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academia ==
By 2006, e-Types became an object of interest to scholars in the [[creative businesses]] academia. The cooperation with [[Learning Lab Denmark]] turned into an industrial [[PhD]] from The Danish School of Education (now [[University of Aarhus]]) using e-Types as the primary case of the research.&lt;ref&gt;http://nordcode.tkk.fi/lyngbypapers/nc3_friis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The focus was "Conscious Design Practice as a Strategic Tool".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-types.com/42114/%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0e-Types%20PhD. e-Types PhD&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Professor Robert Austin from [[Harvard Business School]] made a different case-study concerning [[Innovation]] [[Strategy]] of a Design Firm.

'''Ecotechnology''' - not to be confused with [[ecotechnics]] - is an [[applied science]] that seeks to fulfill [[human]] needs while causing minimal ecological disrupution, by harnessing and manipulating natural forces to leverage their beneficial effects. Ecotechnology integrates two fields of study: the '[[ecology]] of technics' and the 'technics of ecology,' requiring an understanding of the structures and processes of [[ecosystems]] and societies. All [[sustainable engineering]] that can reduce damage to ecosystems, adopt ecology as a fundamental basis, and ensure conservation of [[biodiversity]] and sustainable development may be considered as forms of ecotechnology.

Ecotechnology emphasizes approaching a problem from a [[Holism|holistic]] point of view. For example, [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of rivers should not only consider one single area. Rather, the whole [[Drainage basin|catchment area]], which includes the upstream, middle stream and downstream sections, should be considered.

Construction can reduce its impact on nature by consulting experts on the environment.

Sustainable development requires the implementation of environmentally friendly technologies which are both efficient and adapted to local conditions. Ecotechnology allows improvement in economic performance while minimizing harm to the environment by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Summers|first1=Max|title=Eco-Friendly IT Solutions that Minimise Environmental Damage and Save Natural Resources|url=https://magora-systems.com/eco-friendly-it-solutions/|publisher=Magora|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* increasing the efficiency in the selection and use of materials and energy sources,
* control of impacts on ecosystems,
* development and permanent improvement of cleaner processes and products,
* eco-marketing,
* introducing environmental management systems in the production and services sectors, and
* development of activities for increasing awareness of the need for environmental protection and promotion of sustainable development by the general public.

During ''Ecotechnics '95 - International Symposium on Ecological Engineering'' in [[Östersund]], [[Sweden]], the participants agreed on the definition: "Ecotechnics is defined as the method of designing future societies within ecological frames."

Created in 2006, the GHI was initially published by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) and [[Welthungerhilfe]]. In 2007, the Irish NGO [[Concern Worldwide]] also became a co-publisher.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2006-4|[4]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2007-5|[5]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2008-6|[6]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2009-7|[7]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2010-8|[8]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2011-9|[9]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2012-10|[10]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2013-11|[11]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2014-12|[12]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2015-13|[13]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2016-14|[14]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In 2018, the GHI was a joint project of Welthungerhilfe and Concern Worldwide, with IFPRI stepping aside from its involvement in the report. 

The 2018 Global Hunger Index (GHI) report—the 13th in the annual series—presents a multidimensional measure of national, regional, and global hunger by assigning a numerical score based on several aspects of hunger. It then ranks countries by GHI score and compares current scores with past results. The 2018 report shows that in many countries and in terms of the global average, hunger and undernutrition have declined since 2000; in some parts of the world, however, hunger and undernutrition persist or have even worsened. Since 2010, 16 countries have seen no change or an increase in their GHI levels. 

Besides presenting GHI scores, each year the GHI report includes an essay addressing one particular aspect of hunger. The 2018 report considers the issue of forced migration and hunger.

In previous years, topics included: 

* In 2010: Early childhood undernutrition among children younger than the age of two.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI-Summary2010-16|[16]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
* In 2011: Rising and more volatile food prices of the recent years and the effects these changes     have on hunger and malnutrition.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI-Summary2011-17|[17]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
* In 2012: Achieving food security and sustainable use of natural resources, when the natural     sources of food become increasingly scarce.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI-Summary2012-18|[18]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
* In 2013: Strengthening community resilience against undernutrition and malnutrition.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI-Summary2013-19|[19]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
* In 2014: Hidden hunger, a form of undernutrition characterized by micronutrient deficiencies.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI-Summary2014-20|[20]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
* In 2015: Armed conflict and its relation to hunger.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI-Summary2015-21|[21]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
* In 2016: Reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger by 2030.
* In 2017: The challenges of inequality and hunger. 

In addition to the yearly GHI, the [[India State Hunger Index|Hunger Index for the States of India]] (ISHI) was published in 2008&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-India-GHI2009-22|[22]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and the Sub-National Hunger Index for Ethiopia was published in 2009.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-Ethiopia-GHI2009-23|[23]]]&lt;/sup&gt; 

An [http://www.globalhungerindex.org/map.html interactive map] allows users to visualize the data for different years and zoom into specific regions or countries.

== Calculation of the Index ==
The Index ranks countries on a 100-point scale, with 0 being the best score (no hunger) and 100 being the worst, although neither of these extremes is reached in practice. Values from 0 to 9.9 reflect low hunger, values from 10.0 to 19.9 reflect moderate hunger, values from 20.0 to 34.9 indicate serious hunger, values from 35.0 to 49.9 reflect alarming hunger, and values of 50.0 or more reflect extremely alarming hunger levels.&lt;ref name="GHI-Summary2016"&gt;von Grebmer, Klaus; Bernstein, Jill; Hossain, Naomi; Brown, Tracy; Prasai, Nilam; Yohannes, Yisehac; Patterson, Fraser; Sonntag, Andrea; Zimmermann, Sophia-Marie; Towey, Olive; and Foley, Connell. 2017.

Washington, D.C.; Bonn; and Dublin: International Food Policy Research Institute, Welthungerhilfe, and Concern Worldwide.&lt;/ref&gt;

The GHI combines 4 component indicators: 
1) the proportion of the undernourished as a percentage of the population; 
2) the proportion of children under the age of five suffering from [[wasting]];
3) the proportion of children under the age of five suffering from [[Stunted Growth|stunting]]; 
4) the [[child mortality|mortality rate of children]] under the age of five.&lt;ref group="GHI2016"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/cdmref/p15738coll2/id/130707/filename/130918.pdf#page=7 Chapter 1: The Concept of the Global Hunger Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

The data and projections used for the 2017 GHI are for the period from 2011 to 2016—the most recent available data for the four components of the GHI. The data on the proportion of undernourished come from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN ([[FAO]]) and include authors' estimates.&lt;ref name=FAO2016&gt;FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). 2016. Food Security Indicators
((Updated February 9, 2016). [http://faostat3.fao.org/download/D/*/E]. Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; Data on child wasting and stunting are collected from [[UNICEF]], the [[World Health Organization]], the [[World Bank]], [[WHO]], [http://www.dhsprogram.com MEASURE DHS], the Indian Ministry of Women and Child Development, and also include the authors’ own estimates.&lt;ref group="GHI2016"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/cdmref/p15738coll2/id/130707/filename/130918.pdf#page=9 Chapter 1: The Concept of the Global Hunger Index]&lt;/ref&gt; Data on child mortality are from the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation.&lt;ref name="IGME2015"&gt;UN IGME (UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation). 2015.

== Global and regional trends ==
[[File:BK 2016 GHI ch02 fig01.png|thumb|right|300x300px|Regional Hunger Index Scores, GHI 2016]]Although the 2017 GHI shows long-term progress in the reduction of hunger worldwide, millions are still experiencing chronic hunger and any places are suffering acute food crises and even famine. The 2017 GHI overall score is 27 percent lower than the 2000 score. Of the 119 countries assessed in this year's report, one falls in the extremely alarming range on the GHI Severity Scale; 7 are in the alarming range; 44 in the serious range; and 24 in the moderate range. Only 43 countries have scores considered low.

The regions of the world struggling most with hunger are South Asia and Africa south of the Sahara, with scores in the serious range (30.9 and 29.4, respectively). The scores of East and Southeast Asia, the Near East and North Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States range from low to moderate (between 7.8 and 12.8). These averages conceal some troubling results within each region, however, including scores in the serious range for Tajikistan, Guatemala, Haiti, and Iraq, and alarming in the case of Yemen, as well as scores in the serious range for half of all countries in East and Southeast Asia, whose average benefits from China's low score of 7.5.

Because data on the prevalence of undernourishment and, in some cases, data or estimates on child stunting and child wasting were unavailable, 2017 GHI scores could not be calculated for 13 countries. Yet the countries with missing data may be the ones suffering most. Based on the available data and information from international organizations that specialize in hunger and undernutrition, 9 of the 13 countries that lack sufficient data for calculating 2017 GHI scores still raise significant concern—Burundi, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Libya, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, South Sudan, and Syria.

&lt;small&gt;— = Data are not available or not presented. Some countries did not exist in their present borders in the given year or reference period.

Countries are ranked according to 2018 GHI scores. Countries that have identical 2018 scores are given the same ranking (for example, Bulgaria and the Slovak Republic are both ranked 16th). The following countries could not be included because of lack of data: Bahrain, Bhutan, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Moldova, Qatar, Somaliland, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Tajikistan.&lt;/small&gt;

== Focus of the GHI 2018: Forced Migration and Hunger == 

The essay in the 2018 GHI report examines forced migration and hunger—two closely intertwined challenges that affect some of the poorest and most conflict-ridden regions of the world. Globally, there are an estimated 68.5 million displaced people, including 40.0 million internally displaced people, 25.4 million refugees, and 3.1 million asylum seekers. For these people, hunger may be both a cause and a consequence of forced migration. Support for food-insecure displaced people needs to be improved in four key areas:
•	recognizing and addressing hunger and displacement as political problems;
•	adopting more holistic approaches to protracted displacement settings involving development support;
•	providing support to food-insecure displaced people in their regions of origin; and
•	recognizing that the resilience of displaced people is never entirely absent and should be the basis for providing support.

The 2018 Global Hunger Index report presents recommendations for providing a more effective and holistic response to forced migration and hunger. These include focusing on those countries and groups of people who need the most support, providing long-term solutions for displaced people, and engaging in greater responsibility sharing at an international level.

== Focus 2017: The Inequalities of Hunger ==
The 2017 highlights the uneven nature of progress made in reducing hunger worldwide and the ways in which inequalities of power lead to unequal nourishment.

Achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals’ aim of “leaving no one behind” demands approaches to hunger and malnutrition that are both more sensitive to their uneven distribution and more attuned to the power inequalities that intensify the effects of poverty and marginalization on malnutrition. The report emphasizes the importance of using power analysis to name all forms of power that keep people hungry and malnourished; the significance of designing interventions strategically focused on where power is exerted; the need to empower the hungry and malnourished to challenge and resist loss of control over the food they eat.

== Focus 2016: Getting to zero hunger ==
The 2016 Global Hunger Index (GHI) presents a multidimensional measure of national, regional, and global hunger, focusing on how the world can get to Zero Hunger by 2030.

The developing world has made substantial progress in reducing hunger since 2000. The 2016 GHI shows that the level of hunger in developing countries as a group has fallen by 29 percent. Yet this progress has been uneven, and great disparities in hunger continue to exist at the regional, national, and subnational levels.

The 2016 GHI emphasizes that the regions, countries, and populations most vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition have to be identified, so improvement can be targeted there, if the world community wants to seriously [[Sustainable Development Goals#The goals|Sustainable Development Goal 2]] on [[Hunger#Global initiatives to end hunger|ending hunger]] and achieving [[food security]].&lt;ref group="GHI2016"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/cdmref/p15738coll2/id/130707/filename/130918.pdf#page=28 Chapter 4: Policy Recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus 2015: Armed Conflict and Chronic Hunger==
The chapter on hunger and conflict shows that the time of the great famines with more than 1 million people dead is over. There is, however, a clear connection between armed conflict and severe hunger. Most of the countries scoring worst in the 2015 GHI, are experiencing armed conflict or have in recent years. Still, severe hunger exists also without conflict present as the cases of several countries in South Asia and Africa show.

Since 2005 and increase in armed conflict can be seen. Unless armed conflicts can be reduced there is little hope for overcoming hunger.&lt;ref group="GHI2015"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/cdmref/p15738coll2/id/129681/filename/129892.pdf#page=21 Chapter 3: Armed Conflict and the Challenge of Hunger: Is an End in Sight?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Focus of the GHI 2014: Hidden Hunger ==
Hidden hunger concerns over 200 million people worldwide. This [[micronutrient deficiency]] develops when humans do not take in enough micronutrients such as zinc, folate, iron and vitamins, or when their bodies cannot absorb them. Reasons include an unbalanced [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], a higher need for micronutrients (e.g. during pregnancy or while breast feeding) but also health issues related to sickness, infections or parasites.

The consequences for individuals can be devastating: these often include mental impairment, bad health, low productivity and death caused by sickness. In particular, [[child malnutrition|children]] are affected if they do not absorb enough micronutrients in the first 1000 days of their lives (beginning with conception).&lt;ref group="GHI2014"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ghi14.pdf#page=21 Chapter 3: Addressing the Challenge of Hidden Hunger]&lt;/ref&gt;

Micronutrient deficiencies are responsible for an estimated 1.1 million of the yearly 3.1 million death caused by undernutrition in children. Despite the magnitude of the problem, it is still not easy to get precise data on the spread of hidden hunger. Macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies cause a loss in global productivity of 1.4 to 2.1 billion US Dollars per year.&lt;ref name=FAO2013&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 2013 [http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3300e/i3300e.pdf The State of Food and Agriculture: Food Systems for Better Nutrition]. Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different measures exist to prevent hidden hunger. It is essential to ensure that humans maintain a diverse diet. The quality of produce is as important as the caloric input. This can be achieved by promoting the production of a wide variety of nutrient-rich plants and the creation of house gardens.

Other possible solutions are the [[Fortification|industrial enrichment]] of food or [[biofortification]] of feedplants (e.g. vitamin A rich sweet potatoes).
In the case of acute nutrient deficiency and in specific life phases, food supplements can be used. In particular, the addition of vitamin A leads to a better child survival rate.&lt;ref group="GHI2014"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ghi14.pdf#page=21 Chapter 3: Addressing the Challenge of Hidden Hunger]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the situation concerning hidden hunger can only be improved when many measures intermesh. In addition to the direct measures described above, this includes the education and empowerment of women, the creation of better [[sanitation]] and adequate hygiene, and access to clean drinking water and health services.

== Focus of the GHI 2013: Resilience to build food and nutrition security ==
Many of the countries, in which the [[hunger]] situation is "alarming" or "extremely alarming", are particularly prone to crises: In the African [[Sahel]] people experience yearly droughts. On top of that, they have to deal with violent conflict and natural calamities. At the same time, the global context becomes more and more volatile ([[Great Recession|financial and economic crises]], [[2007–08 world food price crisis|food price crises]]).

The inability to cope with these crises leads to the destruction of many development successes that had been achieved over the years. In addition, people have even less resources to withstand the next shock or crises. 2.6 billion people in the world live with less than 2 USD per day. For them, a sickness in the family, crop failure after a drought or the interruption of [[remittances]] from relatives who live abroad can set in motion a downward spiral from which they cannot free themselves on their own.

It is therefore not enough to support people in emergencies and, once the crises is over, to start longer term development efforts. Instead, emergency and development assistance has to be conceptualized with the goal of increasing [[Psychological resilience|resilience]] of poor people against these shocks.

The Global Hunger Index differentiates three coping strategies. The lower the intensity of the crises, the less resources have to be used to cope with the consequences:&lt;ref group="GHI2013"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ghi13.pdf#page=21 Chapter 3: Understanding Resilience for Food and Nutrition Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Absorption: Skills or resources, which are used to reduce the impact of a crisis without changing the lifestyle (e.g. selling some livestock)
* Adaptation: Once the capacity to absorb is exhausted, steps are taken to adapt the lifestyle to the situation without making drastic changes (e.g. using drought-resistant seeds).
* Transformation: If the adaptation strategies do not suffice to deal with the negative impact of the crises, fundamental, longer lasting changes to life and behavior have to be made (e.g. nomadic tribes become sedentary and become farmers because they cannot keep their herds).

Based on this analysis the authors present several policy recommendations:&lt;ref group="GHI2013"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ghi13.pdf#page=49 Chapter 5: Policy Recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Overcoming the institutional, financial and conceptual boundaries between humanitarian aid and development assistance.
* Elimination of policies that undermine people's resilience. Using the Right to Food as a basis for the development of new policies.
* Implementation of multi-year, flexible programs, which are financed in a way that enables multi-sectoral approaches to overcome chronic food crises.
* Communicating that improving resilience is cost effective and improves food and nutrition security, especially in fragile contexts.
* Scientific monitoring and evaluation of measures and programs with the goal to increase resilience.
* Active involvement of the local population in the planning and implementation of resilience increasing programs.
* Improvement of food especially of mothers and children through nutrition-specific and sensitive interventions to avoid that short-term crises lead to nutrition-related problems late in life or across generations.

== Focus of the GHI 2012: Pressures on land, water and energy resources ==
Increasingly, Hunger is related to how we use land, water and energy. The growing scarcity of these resources puts more and more pressure on food security.
Several factors contribute to an increasing shortage of natural resources:&lt;ref group="GHI2012"&gt;Chapter 3: 'Sustainable food security under land, water, and energy stresses', [http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ghi12.pdf#page=25 pages 25-26]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Demographic change: The world population is expected to be over 9 billion by 2050. Additionally, more and more people live in cities. Urban populations feed themselves differently than inhabitants of rural areas; they tend to consume less staple foods and more meat and dairy products.
# Higher income and non-sustainable use of resources: As the global economy grows, wealthy people consume more food and goods, which have to be produced with a lot of water and energy. They can afford not to be efficient and wasteful in their use of resources.
# Bad policies and weak institutions: When policies, for example energy policy, are not tested for the consequences they have on the availability of land and water it can lead to failures. An example are the biofuel policies of industrialized countries: As corn and sugar are increasingly used for the production of fuels, there is less land and water for the production of food. 
Signs for an increasing scarcity of energy, land and water resources are for example: growing prices for food and energy, a massive increase of large-scale investment in arable land (so-called [[land grabbing]]), increasing degradation of arable land because of too intensive [[land use]] (for example, increasing [[desertification]]), increasing number of people, who live in regions with lowering ground water levels, and the loss of arable land as a consequence of [[climate change]].
The analysis of the global conditions lead the authors of the GHI 2012 to recommend several policy actions:&lt;ref name="GHI-Summary2012"&gt;IFPRI/ Welthungerhilfe/ Concern. 2012. [http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ib70.pdf 2012 Global Hunger Index]. Issue Brief No. 70. Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;
* Securing land and water rights
* Gradual lowering of subsidies
* Creation of a positive macroeconomic framework
* Investment in agriculture technology development to promote a more efficient use of land, water and energy
* Support for approaches, that lead to a more efficient use of land, water and energy along the whole value chain
* Preventing and overuse of natural resources through monitoring strategies for water, land and energy, and agricultural systems
* Improvement of the access to education for women and the strengthening of their reproductive rights to address demographic change
* Increase incomes, reduce social and economic inequality and promotion of sustainable lifestyles
* Climate change mitigation and adaptation through a reorientation of agriculture

== Focus of the GHI 2011: Rising and volatile food prices ==
The report cites 3 factors as the main reasons for high [[volatility (finance)|volatility]], or price changes, and price spikes of food:
* Use of the so-called [[biofuel]]s, promoted by high [[oil price]]s, [[subsidies]] in the United States (&lt;!-- p. 25, graph --&gt;over one third of the corn harvest of 2009 and 2010 respectively) and quota for biofuel in gasoline in the European Union, India and others.
* [[Extreme weather events]] as a result of [[Climate Change]]
* [[Future trading]] of agricultural commodities, for instance investments in fonds,{{Clarify|date=July 2013}} which are speculating on price changes of agricultural products (2003: 13 Bn US Dollar, 2008: 260 Bn US Dollar), as well as increasing [[trade volume]] of these goods.

Volatility and prices increases are worsened according to the report by the concentration of staple foods in a few countries and [[export restriction]]s of these goods, the historical low of worldwide [[cereal]] reserves and the lack of timely information on food products, reserves and price developments. Especially this lack of information can lead to overreactions in the markets. Moreover, seasonal limitations on production possibilities, limited land for agricultural production, limited access to fertilizers and water, as well as the increasing demand resulting from population growth, puts pressure on food prices.

According to the Global Hunger Index 2011 price trends show especially harsh consequences for poor and under-nourished people, because they are not capable to react to price spikes and price changes. Reactions, following these developments, can include: reduced calorie intake, no longer sending children to school, riskier income generation such as [[prostitution]], criminality, or searching landfills, and sending away household members, who cannot be fed anymore. In addition, the report sees an all-time high in the instability and unpredictability of food prices, which after decades of slight decrease, increasingly show price spikes (strong and short-term increase).&lt;ref group="GHI2011"&gt;Chapter 3: ''Combating Hunger in a World of High and Volatile Food Prices''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="GHI2011"&gt;Chapter 4: ''The Impacts of Food Price Spikes and Volatility at Local Levels'', [http://www.welthungerhilfe.de/fileadmin/media/pdf/WHI/WHI2011/WHI-2011_final.pdf#page=22 pages 20–41]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a national level, especially food importing countries (those with a negative food [[trade balance]], are affected by the changing prices.

== Focus of the GHI 2010: Early Childhood Under-nutrition ==

Under-nutrition among children has reached terrible levels. About 195 million children under the age of five in the developing world—about one in three children—are too small and thus underdeveloped. Nearly one in four children under age five—129 million—is underweight, and one in 10 is severely underweight. The problem of child under-nutrition is concentrated in a few countries and regions with more than 90 percent of stunted children living in Africa and Asia. 42% of the world's undernourished children live in India alone.

The evidence presented in the report&lt;ref name="Victora2008"&gt;Victora, C. G., L. Adair, C. Fall, P. C. Hallal, R. Martorell, L. Richter und H. Singh Sachdev for the Maternal and Child Undernutrition Study Group. 2008. Maternal and child undernutrition: Consequences for adult health and human capital. "The Lancet" 371 (9609): 340–57&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Victora2010"&gt;Victora, C. G., M. de Onis, P. C. Hallal, M. Blössner und R. Shrimpton. 2010. Worldwide timing of growth faltering: Revisiting implications for interventions. "Pediatrics" 125 (3): 473.
&lt;/ref&gt; shows that the window of opportunity for improving nutrition spans is the 1,000 days between conception and a child's second birthday (that is the period from -9 to +24 months). Children who are do not receive adequate nutrition during this period have increased risks to experiencing lifelong damage, including poor physical and cognitive development, poor health, and even early death. The consequences of malnutrition that occurred after 24 months of a child's life are by contrast largely reversible.&lt;ref name="GHI2010"&gt;IFPRI/ Concern/ Welthungerhilfe: [http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ghi10.pdf 2010 Global Hunger Index The challenge of hunger: Focus on the crisis of child undernutrition].

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2016}}

'''Industrial ecology''' ('''IE''') is the study of [[material flow|material]] and [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flows]] through industrial systems.  The [[global economy|global]] [[industrial economy]] can be modelled as a network of industrial processes that extract resources from the [[Earth]] and transform those resources into [[Commodity|commodities]] which can be bought and sold to meet the needs of humanity.  Industrial ecology seeks to quantify the material flows and document the industrial processes that make modern society function.  Industrial ecologists are often concerned with the impacts that industrial activities have on the [[Natural environment|environment]], with use of the planet's supply of [[natural resources]], and with problems of [[waste disposal]].  Industrial ecology is a young but growing multidisciplinary field of research which combines aspects of [[engineering]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[toxicology]] and the [[Outline of natural science|natural sciences]].

Industrial ecology has been defined as a "systems-based, multidisciplinary discourse that seeks to understand emergent behaviour of complex integrated human/natural systems".&lt;ref name="OntologiesOfIE"/&gt;  The field approaches issues of [[sustainability]] by examining problems from multiple perspectives, usually involving aspects of sociology, the [[natural environment|environment]], [[economy]] and [[technology]].  The name comes from the idea that the analogy of natural systems should be used as an aid in understanding how to design sustainable industrial systems.&lt;ref name="StrategiesForManufacturing"/&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:IndustrialSymbiosisWasteHeatExchange.png|250px|right|thumb|Example of [[Industrial Symbiosis]].  Waste steam from a [[Waste incineration|waste incinerator]] (right) is piped to an [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol plant]] (left) where it is used as in input to their production process.]]
Industrial ecology is concerned with the shifting of industrial process from linear (open loop) systems, in which resource and capital investments move through the system to become waste, to a closed loop system where wastes can become inputs for new processes.

Much of the research focuses on the following areas:&lt;ref name="is4ieHistory"/&gt;
* [[Material flow analysis|material]] and energy flow studies ("[[industrial metabolism]]")
* [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]] and [[Low-carbon economy|decarbonization]]
* technological change and the environment
* [[life cycle assessment|life-cycle planning, design and assessment]]
* [[Design for Environment|design for the environment ("eco-design")]]
* [[Extended producer responsibility| extended producer responsibility ("product stewardship")]]
* [[Eco-industrial park| eco-industrial parks ("industrial symbiosis") ]]
* product-oriented environmental policy
* [[eco-efficiency]]

Industrial ecology seeks to understand the way in which industrial systems (for example a factory, an [[ecoregion]], or national or global economy) interact with the [[biosphere]].  Natural ecosystems provide a metaphor for understanding how different parts of industrial systems interact with one another, in an "ecosystem" based on resources and [[infrastructural capital]] rather than on [[natural capital]]. It seeks to exploit the idea that natural systems do not have waste in them to inspire [[sustainable design]].

Along with more general [[energy conservation]] and material conservation goals, and redefining [[commodity markets]] and [[product stewardship]] relations strictly as a [[service economy]], industrial ecology is one of the four objectives of [[Natural Capitalism]].  This strategy discourages forms of amoral purchasing arising from ignorance of what goes on at a distance and implies a [[political economy]] that values [[natural capital]] highly and relies on more [[instructional capital]] to design and maintain each unique industrial ecology.

==History==
[[File:View from Asnaes power station Kalundborg Denmark.jpg|300px|right|thumb|View of [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park]]]]
{{Main|History of industrial ecology}}

Industrial ecology was popularized in 1989 in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by [[Robert Frosch]] and Nicholas E. Gallopoulos.  Frosch and Gallopoulos' vision was "why would not our industrial system behave like an [[ecosystem]], where the wastes of a species may be [[natural resource|resource]] to another species? Why would not the outputs of an industry be the inputs of another, thus reducing use of [[raw material]]s, [[pollution]], and saving on [[waste]] treatment?"&lt;ref name="StrategiesForManufacturing"/&gt;  A notable example resides in a Danish industrial park in the city of [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park|Kalundborg]].  Here several linkages of [[byproduct]]s and [[waste heat]] can be found between numerous entities such as a large power plant, an oil refinery, a pharmaceutical plant, a plasterboard factory, an enzyme manufacturer, a waste company and the city itself.&lt;ref name="KalundborgCentre"/&gt; Another example is the Rantasalmi EIP in Rantasalmi, Finland. While this country has had previous organically formed EIP's, the park at Rantasalmi is Finland's first planned EIP.

The scientific field Industrial Ecology has grown quickly in recent years. The Journal of Industrial Ecology (since 1997), the [[International Society for Industrial Ecology]] (since 2001), and the journal Progress in Industrial Ecology (since 2004) give Industrial Ecology a strong and dynamic position in the international scientific community.  Industrial Ecology principles are also emerging in various policy realms such as the concept of the [[Circular Economy]] that is being promoted in China. Although the definition of the Circular Economy has yet to be formalized, generally the focus is on strategies such as creating a circular flow of materials, and cascading energy flows. An example of this would be using waste heat from one process to run another process that requires a lower temperature. The hope is that strategy such as this will create a more efficient economy with fewer pollutants and other unwanted by-products.&lt;ref name="CircularEconomy"/&gt;

== Principles ==
One of the central principles of Industrial Ecology is the view that societal and technological systems are bounded within the [[biosphere]], and do not exist outside it.  [[Ecology]] is used as a ''metaphor'' due to the observation that natural systems reuse materials and have a largely closed loop cycling of nutrients.  Industrial Ecology approaches problems with the hypothesis that by using similar principles as ''natural systems, industrial systems'' can be improved to reduce their impact on the natural environment as well. The table shows the general metaphor.

IE examines societal issues and their relationship with both technical systems and the environment. Through this ''[[holistic]] view '', IE recognizes that solving problems must involve understanding the connections that exist between these systems, various aspects cannot be viewed in isolation. Often changes in one part of the overall [[system]] can propagate and cause changes in another part. Thus, you can only understand a problem if you look at its parts in relation to the whole. Based on this framework, IE looks at environmental issues with a ''[[systems thinking]]'' approach. A good IE example with these societal impacts can be found at the [[Blue Lagoon (geothermal spa)|Blue Lagoon]] in Iceland. The Lagoon uses super-heated water from a local geothermal power plant to fill mineral-rich basins that have become recreational healing centers. In this sense the industrial process of energy production uses its wastewater to provide a crucial resource for the dependent recreational industry.

Take a city for instance. A city can be divided into commercial areas, residential areas, offices, services, infrastructures, and so forth. These are all sub-systems of the 'big city’ system. Problems can emerge in one sub-system, but the solution has to be global. Let’s say the price of housing is rising dramatically because there is too high a demand for housing. One solution would be to build new houses, but this will lead to more people living in the city, leading to the need for more infrastructure like roads, schools, more supermarkets, etc. This system is a simplified interpretation of reality whose behaviors can be ‘predicted’.

In many cases, the systems IE deals with are complex systems. [[Complex systems|Complexity]] makes it difficult to understand the behavior of the system and may lead to rebound effects. Due to unforeseen behavioral change of users or consumers, a measure taken to improve environmental performance does not lead to any improvement or may even worsen the situation.

Moreover, ''life cycle thinking'' is also a very important principle in industrial ecology. It implies that all environmental impacts caused by a product, system, or project during its life cycle are taken into account. In this context life cycle includes
*[[Raw material]] extraction
*[[Material processing]]
*Manufacture
*Use
*Maintenance
*Disposal
The transport necessary between these stages is also taken into account as well as, if relevant, extra stages such as [[reuse]], [[Remanufacturing|remanufacture]], and [[recycle]].
Adopting a life cycle approach is essential to avoid shifting environmental impacts from one life cycle stage to another. This is commonly referred to as problem shifting. For instance, during the re-design of a product, one can choose to reduce its weight, thereby decreasing use of resources. However, it is possible that the lighter materials used in the new product will be more difficult to dispose of. The environmental impacts of the product gained during the extraction phase are shifted to the disposal phase. Overall environmental improvements are thus null.

A final important principle of IE is its ''integrated approach'' or ''[[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinarity]]''. IE takes into account three different disciplines: social sciences (including economics), technical sciences and environmental sciences. The challenge is to merge them into a single approach.

==Examples==
The [[Kalundborg]] industrial park is located in Denmark. This industrial park is special because companies reuse each other's waste (which then becomes by-products). For example, the Energy E2 [[Asnæs Power Station]] produces [[gypsum]] as a by-product of the electricity generation process; this gypsum becomes a resource for the BPB Gyproc A/S which produces plasterboards.&lt;ref name="KalundborgCentre"/&gt; This is one example of a system inspired by the biosphere-technosphere metaphor: in ecosystems, the waste from one organism is used as inputs to other organisms; in industrial systems, waste from a company is used as a resource by others.

Apart from the direct benefit of incorporating waste into the loop, the use of an eco-industrial park can be a means of making renewable energy generating plants, like [[Photovoltaic system|Solar PV]], more economical and environmentally friendly. In essence, this assists the growth of the [[renewable energy industry]] and the environmental benefits that come with replacing fossil-fuels.&lt;ref name="PearcePhotovoltaic"/&gt;

Additional examples of industrial ecology include:
*Substituting the fly ash byproduct of coal burning practices for cement in concrete production&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Michael. "Optimizing the Use of Fly Ash in Concrete." Portland Cement Association&lt;/ref&gt;
*Using second generation biofuels. An example of this is converting grease or cooking oil to biodiesels to fuel vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.extension.org/pages/28000/used-and-waste-oil-and-grease-for-biodiesel|title=Used and Waste Oil and Grease for Biodiesel - eXtension|author=|date=|website=extension.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*South Africa's National Cleaner Production Center (NCPC) was created in order to make the region's industries more efficient in terms of materials. Results of the use of sustainable methods will include lowered energy costs and improved waste management. The program assesses existing companies to implement change.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncpc.co.za&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future directions==
The [[ecosystem]] metaphor popularized by [[Robert Frosch|Frosch]] and Gallopoulos&lt;ref name="StrategiesForManufacturing" /&gt; has been a valuable creative tool for helping researchers look for novel solutions to difficult problems.  Recently, it has been pointed out that this metaphor is based largely on a model of classical ecology, and that advancements in understanding ecology based on [[complexity science]] have been made by researchers such as [[C. S. Holling]], [[James J. Kay]],&lt;ref name="OnComplexityTheory"/&gt; and further advanced in terms of contemporary ecology by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levine | first1 = S.

.&lt;ref name="ABMAndIE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ApplyingABMinIE"/&gt;

[[Exergy]] analysis is performed in the field of industrial ecology to use energy more efficiently.&lt;ref name="ExergyUsefulConcept"/&gt; The term ''exergy'' was coined by [[Zoran Rant]] in 1956, but the concept was developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]]. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, [[ecological economics]], [[systems ecology]], and [[energetics]].

== Other examples ==

Another great example of industrial ecology both in practice and in potential is the Burnside Cleaner Production Centre in [[Burnside, Nova Scotia]]. They play a role in facilitating the 'greening' of over 1200 businesses that are located in Burnside, Eastern Canada's largest industrial park. The creation of waste exchange is a big part of what they work towards, which will promote strong industrial ecology relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newcity.ca/Pages/industrial_ecology.html|title=Industrial Ecology: From Theory to Practice|author=|date=|website=newcity.ca|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pixelbay Question mark Word Art.png|thumb|A question mark]]
An '''inquiry''' is any process that has the aim of augmenting [[knowledge]], resolving [[doubt]], or [[problem solving|solving a problem]]. A theory of inquiry is an account of the various types of inquiry and a treatment of the ways that each type of inquiry achieves its aim.
{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Inquiry theories==

===Deduction===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When three terms are so related to one another that the last is wholly contained in the middle and the middle is wholly contained in or excluded from the first, the extremes must admit of perfect syllogism. By 'middle term' I mean that which both is contained in another and contains another in itself, and which is the middle by its position also; and by 'extremes' (a) that which is contained in another, and (b) that in which another is contained. For if ''A'' is predicated of all ''B'', and ''B'' of all ''C'', ''A'' must necessarily be predicated of all ''C''. ... I call this kind of figure the First. (Aristotle, ''Prior Analytics'', 1.4)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Induction===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Inductive reasoning consists in establishing a relation between one extreme term and the middle term by means of the other extreme; for example, if ''B'' is the middle term of ''A'' and ''C'', in proving by means of ''C'' that ''A'' applies to ''B'';  for this is how we effect inductions. (Aristotle, ''Prior Analytics'', 2.23)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Abduction===
The ''locus classicus'' for the study of [[abductive reasoning]] is found in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Book 2, Chapt. 25. It begins this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have Reduction (απαγωγη, [[abductive reasoning|abduction]]):
:# When it is obvious that the first term applies to the middle, but that the middle applies to the last term is not obvious, yet is nevertheless more probable or not less probable than the conclusion;
:# Or if there are not many intermediate terms between the last and the middle;
For in all such cases the effect is to bring us nearer to knowledge.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By way of explanation, [[Aristotle]] supplies two very instructive examples, one for each of the two varieties of abductive inference steps that he has just described in the abstract:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:# For example, let ''A'' stand for "that which can be taught", ''B'' for "knowledge", and ''C'' for "morality". Then that knowledge can be taught is evident;  but whether virtue is knowledge is not clear. Then if ''BC'' is not less probable or is more probable than ''AC'', we have reduction;  for we are nearer to knowledge for having introduced an additional term, whereas before we had no knowledge that ''AC'' is true.
:# Or again we have reduction if there are not many intermediate terms between ''B'' and ''C'';  for in this case too we are brought nearer to knowledge. For example, suppose that ''D'' is "to square", ''E'' "rectilinear figure", and ''F'' "circle".  Assuming that between ''E'' and ''F'' there is only one intermediate term — that the circle becomes equal to a rectilinear figure by means of [[Lune (mathematics)|lunules]] — we should approximate to knowledge. ([[Aristotle]], "[[Prior Analytics]]", 2.25, with minor alterations)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aristotle's latter variety of abductive reasoning, though it will take some explaining in the sequel, is well worth our contemplation, since it hints already at streams of inquiry that course well beyond the syllogistic source from which they spring, and into regions that Peirce will explore more broadly and deeply.

==Inquiry in the pragmatic paradigm&lt;!--Section linked from [[Issue-based information system]] and [[Problem structuring methods]]: do not rename without fixing incoming link (see [[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;==
In the pragmatic philosophies of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], and others, inquiry is closely associated with the [[normative science]] of [[logic]]. In its inception, the pragmatic model or theory of inquiry was extracted by Peirce from its raw materials in classical logic, with a little bit of help from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and refined in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic by [[George Boole|Boole]], [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]], and Peirce himself to address problems about the nature and conduct of scientific reasoning. Borrowing a brace of concepts from [[Aristotle]], Peirce examined three fundamental modes of reasoning that play a role in inquiry, commonly known as [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] [[inference]].

In rough terms, ''[[abductive reasoning|abduction]]'' is what we use to generate a likely [[hypothesis]] or an initial [[diagnosis]] in response to a phenomenon of interest or a problem of concern, while ''[[deductive reasoning|deduction]]'' is used to clarify, to derive, and to explicate the relevant consequences of the selected hypothesis, and ''[[inductive reasoning|induction]]'' is used to test the sum of the predictions against the sum of the data. It needs to be observed that the classical and pragmatic treatments of the types of reasoning, dividing the generic territory of inference as they do into three special parts, arrive at a different characterization of the environs of reason than do those accounts that count only two.

These three processes typically operate in a cyclic fashion, systematically operating to reduce the uncertainties and the difficulties that initiated the inquiry in question, and in this way, to the extent that inquiry is successful, leading to an increase in knowledge or in skills.

In the pragmatic way of thinking everything has a purpose, and the purpose of each thing is the first thing we should try to note about it.&lt;ref&gt;Rescher, N. (2012). ''Pragmatism: The Restoration of its Scientific Roots''. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of inquiry is to reduce doubt and lead to a state of belief, which a person in that state will usually call ''[[knowledge]]'' or ''[[certainty]]''. As they contribute to the end of inquiry, we should appreciate that the three kinds of inference describe a cycle that can be understood only as a whole, and none of the three makes complete sense in isolation from the others. For instance, the purpose of abduction is to generate guesses of a kind that deduction can explicate and that induction can evaluate. This places a mild but meaningful constraint on the production of hypotheses, since it is not just any wild guess at explanation that submits itself to reason and bows out when defeated in a match with reality. In a similar fashion, each of the other types of inference realizes its purpose only in accord with its proper role in the whole cycle of inquiry. No matter how much it may be necessary to study these processes in abstraction from each other, the integrity of inquiry places strong limitations on the effective [[modularity]] of its principal components.

In ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'', John Dewey defined inquiry as "the controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation into one that is so determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert the elements of the original situation into a unified whole"&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John (1938). ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry''. New York:NY: D.C. Heath &amp; Co.&lt;http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/osullis/spring07/courses/page0/history/documents_files/Dewey_pattern%20of%20inquiry.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey and Peirce's conception of inquiry extended beyond a system of thinking and incorporated the social nature of inquiry. These ideas are summarize in the notion [[Community of inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Fixation of Belief]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seixas|first=Peter|title=The Community of Inquiry as a Basis for Knowledge and Learning: The Case of History|url=http://aer.sagepub.com/content/30/2/305.short|publisher=Sage|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shields|first=Patricia|title=The Community of Inquiry|url=http://aas.sagepub.com/content/35/5/510.short|publisher=Sage|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and science of inquiry===
For our present purposes, the first feature to note in distinguishing the three principal modes of reasoning from each other is whether each of them is exact or approximate in character. In this light, deduction is the only one of the three types of reasoning that can be made exact, in essence, always deriving true conclusions from true premises, while abduction and induction are unavoidably approximate in their modes of operation, involving elements of fallible judgment in practice and inescapable error in their application.

The reason for this is that deduction, in the ideal limit, can be rendered a purely internal process of the reasoning agent, while the other two modes of reasoning essentially demand a constant interaction with the outside world, a source of phenomena and problems that will no doubt continue to exceed the capacities of any finite resource, human or machine, to master. Situated in this larger reality, approximations can be judged appropriate only in relation to their context of use and can be judged fitting only with regard to a purpose in view.

A parallel distinction that is often made in this connection is to call deduction a ''demonstrative'' form of inference, while abduction and induction are classed as ''[[non-demonstrative]]'' forms of reasoning. Strictly speaking, the latter two modes of reasoning are not properly called inferences at all. They are more like controlled associations of words or ideas that just happen to be successful often enough to be preserved as useful heuristic strategies in the repertoire of the agent. But non-demonstrative ways of thinking are inherently subject to error, and must be constantly checked out and corrected as needed in practice.

In classical terminology, forms of judgment that require attention to the context and the purpose of the judgment are said to involve an element of "art", in a sense that is judged to distinguish them from "science", and in their renderings as expressive judgments to implicate arbiters in styles of [[rhetoric]], as contrasted with [[logic]].

In a figurative sense, this means that only deductive logic can be reduced to an exact theoretical science, while the practice of any empirical science will always remain to some degree an art.

===Zeroth order inquiry===
Many aspects of inquiry can be recognized and usefully studied in very basic logical settings, even simpler than the level of [[syllogism]], for example, in the realm of reasoning that is variously known as ''[[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]'', ''[[propositional logic|propositional calculus]]'', ''sentential calculus'', or ''zeroth-order logic''. By way of approaching the learning curve on the gentlest availing slope, we may well begin at the level of ''[[zeroth-order inquiry]]'', in effect, taking the syllogistic approach to inquiry only so far as the propositional or sentential aspects of the associated reasoning processes are concerned. One of the bonuses of doing this in the context of Peirce's logical work is that it provides us with doubly instructive exercises in the use of his [[logical graph]]s, taken at the level of his so-called "[[alpha graph]]s".

In the case of propositional calculus or sentential logic, deduction comes down to applications of the [[transitive relation|transitive law]] for conditional implications and the approximate forms of inference hang on the properties that derive from these. In describing the various types of inference I will employ a few old "terms of art" from classical logic that are still of use in treating these kinds of simple problems in reasoning.

: '''Deduction''' takes a Case, the [[minor premise]] &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;
: and combines it with a Rule, the major premise &lt;math&gt;Y \Rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
: to arrive at an Act, the demonstrative [[logical consequence|conclusion]] &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Z.&lt;/math&gt;

: '''Induction''' takes a Case of the form &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;
: and matches it with a Fact of the form &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
: to infer a Rule of the form &lt;math&gt;Y \Rightarrow Z.&lt;/math&gt;

: '''Abduction''' takes a Fact of the form &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
: and matches it with a Rule of the form &lt;math&gt;Y \Rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt;
: to infer a Case of the form &lt;math&gt;X \Rightarrow Y.&lt;/math&gt;

For ease of reference, Figure 1 and the Legend beneath it
summarize the classical terminology for the three types
of inference and the relationships among them.

In its original usage a statement of Fact has to do with a deed done or a record made, that is, a type of event that is openly observable and not riddled with speculation as to its very occurrence. In contrast, a statement of Case may refer to a hidden or a hypothetical cause, that is, a type of event that is not immediately observable to all concerned. Obviously, the distinction is a rough one and the question of which mode applies can depend on the points of view that different observers adopt over time. Finally, a statement of a Rule is called that because it states a regularity or a regulation that governs a whole class of situations, and not because of its syntactic form. So far in this discussion, all three types of constraint are expressed in the form of conditional propositions, but this is not a fixed requirement. In practice, these modes of statement are distinguished by the roles that they play within an argument, not by their style of expression. When the time comes to branch out from the syllogistic framework, we will find that propositional constraints can be discovered and represented in arbitrary syntactic forms.

==Example of inquiry==
Examples of inquiry, that illustrate the full cycle of its abductive, deductive, and inductive phases, and yet are both concrete and simple enough to be suitable for a first (or zeroth) exposition, are somewhat rare in Peirce's writings, and so let us draw one from the work of fellow pragmatician [[John Dewey]], analyzing it according to the model of zeroth-order inquiry that we developed above.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man is walking on a warm day. The sky was clear the last time he observed it; but presently he notes, while occupied primarily with other things, that the air is cooler. It occurs to him that it is probably going to rain; looking up, he sees a dark cloud between him and the sun, and he then quickens his steps. What, if anything, in such a situation can be called thought? Neither the act of walking nor the noting of the cold is a thought. Walking is one direction of activity; looking and noting are other modes of activity. The likelihood that it will rain is, however, something ''suggested''. The pedestrian ''feels'' the cold; he ''thinks of'' clouds and a coming shower. (John Dewey, ''[[How We Think]]'', 1910, pp. 6-7).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Once over quickly===
Let's first give Dewey's example of inquiry in everyday life the quick once over, hitting just the high points of its analysis into Peirce's three kinds of reasoning.

====Abductive phase====
In Dewey's "Rainy Day" or "Sign of Rain" story, we find our peripatetic hero presented with a surprising Fact:
:* Fact: C → A, In the Current situation the Air is cool.

Responding to an intellectual reflex of puzzlement about the situation, his resource of common knowledge about the world is impelled to seize on an approximate Rule:
:* Rule: B → A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool.
This Rule can be recognized as having a potential relevance to the situation because it matches the surprising Fact, C → A, in its consequential feature A.

All of this suggests that the present Case may be one in which it is just about to rain:
:* Case: C → B,  The Current situation is just Before it rains.

The whole mental performance, however automatic and semi-conscious it may be, that leads up from a problematic Fact and a previously settled knowledge base of Rules to the plausible suggestion of a Case description, is what we are calling an [[abductive inference]].

====Deductive phase====
The next phase of inquiry uses deductive inference to expand the implied consequences of the abductive hypothesis, with the aim of testing its truth. For this purpose, the inquirer needs to think of other things that would follow from the consequence of his precipitate explanation. Thus, he now reflects on the Case just assumed:
:* Case: C → B, The Current situation is just Before it rains.

He looks up to scan the sky, perhaps in a random search for further information, but since the sky is a logical place to look for details of an imminent rainstorm, symbolized in our story by the letter B, we may safely suppose that our reasoner has already detached the consequence of the abduced Case, C → B, and has begun to expand on its further implications. So let us imagine that our up-looker has a more deliberate purpose in mind, and that his search for additional data is driven by the new-found, determinate Rule:
:* Rule: B → D, Just Before it rains, Dark clouds appear.

Contemplating the assumed Case in combination with this new Rule leads him by an immediate deduction to predict an additional Fact:
:* Fact: C → D, In the Current situation Dark clouds appear.

The reconstructed picture of reasoning assembled in this second phase of inquiry is true to the pattern of [[deductive inference]].

====Inductive phase====
Whatever the case, our subject observes a Dark cloud, just as he would expect on the basis of the new hypothesis. The explanation of imminent rain removes the discrepancy between observations and expectations and thereby reduces the shock of surprise that made this process of inquiry necessary.

===Looking more closely===

====Seeding hypotheses====
Figure 4 gives a graphical illustration of Dewey's example of inquiry, isolating for the purposes of the present analysis the first two steps in the more extended proceedings that go to make up the whole inquiry.

&lt;/pre&gt;

In this analysis of the first steps of Inquiry, we have a complex or a mixed form of inference that can be seen as taking place in two steps:
:* The first step is an Abduction that abstracts a Case from the consideration of a Fact and a Rule.
:: Fact: C → A, In the Current situation the Air is cool.
:: Rule: B → A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool.
:: Case: C → B, The Current situation is just Before it rains.

:* The final step is a Deduction that admits this Case to another Rule and so arrives at a novel Fact.
:: Case: C → B, The Current situation is just Before it rains.
:: Rule: B → D, Just Before it rains, a Dark cloud will appear.
:: Fact: C → D, In the Current situation, a Dark cloud will appear.

This is nowhere near a complete analysis of the Rainy Day inquiry, even insofar as it might be carried out within the constraints of the syllogistic framework, and it covers only the first two steps of the relevant inquiry process, but maybe it will do for a start.

One other thing needs to be noticed here, the formal duality between this expansion phase of inquiry and the argument from [[analogy]]. This can be seen most clearly in the propositional [[graph (data structure)|lattice]] diagrams shown in Figures 3 and 4, where analogy exhibits a rough "A" shape and the first two steps of inquiry exhibit a rough "V" shape, respectively. Since we find ourselves repeatedly referring to this expansion phase of inquiry as a unit, let's give it a name that suggests its duality with [[analogical reasoning|analogy]]—"[[catalogical reasoning|catalogy]]" will do for the moment. This usage is apt enough if one thinks of a catalogue entry for an item as a text that lists its salient features. Notice that [[analogical reasoning|analogy]] has to do with the examples of a given quality, while [[catalogical reasoning|catalogy]] has to do with the qualities of a given example. Peirce noted similar forms of duality in many of his early writings, leading to the consummate treatment in his 1867 paper [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/newlist/nl-frame.htm "On a New List of Categories"] (CP 1.545-559, W 2, 49-59).

====Weeding hypotheses====
In order to comprehend the bearing of [[inductive reasoning]] on the closing phases of inquiry there are a couple of observations that we need to make:
:* First, we need to recognize that smaller inquiries are typically woven into larger inquiries, whether we view the whole pattern of inquiry as carried on by a single agent or by a complex community.
:* Further, we need to consider the different ways in which the particular instances of inquiry can be related to ongoing inquiries at larger scales. Three modes of inductive interaction between the micro-inquiries and the macro-inquiries that are salient here can be described under the headings of the "Learning", the "Transfer", and the "Testing" of rules.

====Analogy of experience====
Throughout inquiry the reasoner makes use of rules that have to be transported across intervals of experience, from the masses of experience where they are learned to the moments of experience where they are applied. Inductive reasoning is involved in the learning and the transfer of these rules, both in accumulating a knowledge base and in carrying it through the times between acquisition and application.
:* Learning. The principal way that induction contributes to an ongoing inquiry is through the learning of rules, that is, by creating each of the rules that goes into the knowledge base, or ever gets used along the way.
:* Transfer. The continuing way that induction contributes to an ongoing inquiry is through the exploit of analogy, a two-step combination of induction and deduction that serves to transfer rules from one context to another.
:* Testing. Finally, every inquiry that makes use of a knowledge base constitutes a "field test" of its accumulated contents. If the knowledge base fails to serve any live inquiry in a satisfactory manner, then there is a prima facie reason to reconsider and possibly to amend some of its rules.

Let's now consider how these principles of learning, transfer, and testing apply to John Dewey's "Sign of Rain" example.

=====Learning=====
Rules in a knowledge base, as far as their effective content goes, can be obtained by any mode of inference.

For example, a rule like:
:* Rule: B → A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool,
is usually induced from a consideration of many past events, in a manner that can be rationally reconstructed as follows:
:* Case: C → B, In Certain events, it is just Before it rains,
:* Fact: C → A, In Certain events, the Air is cool,
: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:* Rule: B → A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool.

However, the very same proposition could also be abduced as an explanation of a singular occurrence or deduced as a conclusion of a presumptive theory.

=====Transfer=====
What is it that gives a distinctively inductive character to the acquisition of a knowledge base? It is evidently the "analogy of experience" that underlies its useful application. Whenever we find ourselves prefacing an argument with the phrase "If past experience is any guide..." then we can be sure that this principle has come into play. We are invoking an analogy between past experience, considered as a totality, and present experience, considered as a point of application. What we mean in practice is this: "If past experience is a fair sample of possible experience, then the knowledge gained in it applies to present experience". This is the mechanism that allows a knowledge base to be carried across gulfs of experience that are indifferent to the effective contents of its rules.

Here are the details of how this notion of transfer works out in the case of the "Sign of Rain" example:

Let K(pres) be a portion of the reasoner's knowledge base that is [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the conjunction of two rules, as follows:
:* K(pres) = (B → A) and (B → D).

K(pres) is the present knowledge base, expressed in the form of a logical constraint on the present [[universe of discourse]].

It is convenient to have the option of expressing all logical statements in terms of their [[model theory|logical models]], that is, in terms of the primitive circumstances or the elements of experience over which they hold true.
:* Let E(past) be the chosen set of experiences, or the circumstances that we have in mind when we refer to "past experience".
:* Let E(poss) be the collective set of experiences, or the projective total of possible circumstances.
:* Let E(pres) be the present experience, or the circumstances that are present to the reasoner at the current moment.

If we think of the knowledge base K(pres) as referring to the "regime of experience" over which it is valid, then all of these sets of models can be compared by the simple relations of [[set inclusion]] or [[logical implication]].

Figure 5 schematizes this way of viewing the "analogy of experience".

Figure 5.  Analogy of Experience
&lt;/pre&gt;

In these terms, the "analogy of experience" proceeds by inducing a Rule about the validity of a current knowledge base and then deducing a Fact, its applicability to a current experience, as in the following sequence:

Inductive Phase:
:* Given Case: E(past) → E(poss), Chosen events fairly sample Collective events.
:* Given Fact: E(past) → K(pres), Chosen events support the Knowledge regime.
: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:* Induce Rule: E(poss) → K(pres), Collective events support the Knowledge regime.

Deductive Phase:
:* Given Case: E(pres) → E(poss), Current events fairly sample Collective events.
:* Given Rule: E(poss) → K(pres), Collective events support the Knowledge regime.
: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:* Deduce Fact: E(pres) → K(pres), Current events support the Knowledge regime.

=====Testing=====
If the observer looks up and does not see dark clouds, or if he runs for shelter but it does not rain, then there is fresh occasion to question the utility or the validity of his knowledge base. But we must leave our foulweather friend for now and defer the logical analysis of this testing phase to another occasion.

Located in Potsdam, Germany, the '''Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS)''' aims to identify and promote development pathways for a global transformation towards a sustainable society. The IASS employs a transdisciplinary approach that encourages dialogue to understand sustainability issues and generate potential solutions in cooperation with partners from the sciences, politics, the economy, and civil society. A strong network of national and international partners supports the work of the Institute. Its central research topics include the energy transition, emerging technologies, climate change, air quality, systemic risks, governance and participation, and cultures of transformation in the Anthropocene.&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwfk.brandenburg.de/cms/detail.php/bb1.c.263439.de|title=IASS Potsdam - MWFK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The IASS currently employs around 120 persons, including Fellows from over 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iass-potsdam.de/sites/default/files/files/150203_activity_deutsch_interaktiv_doppelseiten.pdf IASS Activities 2012–2013], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the Board of Directors was composed of the Institute's three Scientific Directors – [[Mark G. Lawrence]], [[Patrizia Nanz]] and [[Ortwin Renn]] – and its Head of Administration, Katja Carson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/news-media/news/patrizia-nanz-joins-iass-scientific-director-new-leadership-team-takes-helm|title=Patrizia Nanz Joins IASS as Scientific Director – New Leadership Team Takes the Helm - IASS Potsdam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IASS receives funding from the German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry for Education and Research]] (85%) and the [[Brandenburg|Federal State of Brandenburg]] (15%). The Institute's research programme currently spans five areas: [[Energy transition|Transformation of Energy Systems]], Air Quality in the Context of Global Change, [[Sustainability Governance]], [[Emerging Technologies and Social Transformations in the Anthropocene]], and [[Economics and Culture]]. These research areas are supported in their work by the Cross-cutting Unit on Transdisciplinarity and Transformation, which is tasked with driving the development of theory and methodology at the IASS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/institute/idea/structure-bodies|title=Structure &amp; Bodies - IASS Potsdam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IASS is a registered voluntary association under German law. The Institute's supervisory, governing, and advisory bodies are its General Assembly, Board of Directors and Advisory Board.

== History ==
The IASS was founded in [[Potsdam]], Germany, on 2 February 2009. Germany politician and environmental policy expert [[Klaus Töpfer]] was the Institute's founding director. He led the Institute as its executive director until September 2015, together with scientific directors [[Carlo Rubbia]] (June 2010 – May 2015) and [[Mark G. Lawrence]] (from October 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/news-media/news/klaus-topfer-bids-farewell-iass-established-platform-dialogue-between-science-and|title=Klaus Töpfer Bids Farewell: IASS Established as a Platform for Dialogue between Science and Society - IASS Potsdam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a founding symposium held under the patronage of Angela Merkel, the then [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Minister of Education and Research]] [[Annette Schavan]] stated: "Under Professor Töpfer's leadership, the Institute will be able to gain international prominence and underscore Germany's strong position in this field."

The idea for the IASS was born in 2007 at the Potsdam Nobel Laureate Symposium "Global Sustainability – A Nobel Cause". The symposium brought together leading researchers and decision-makers and resulted in the publication of the widely regarded [[Potsdam Memorandum]], which called for a concerted effort to tap into "all sources of ingenuity" to address the challenges of the twenty-first century. The memorandum urged the establishment of a new "global contract" between science and society to bring together relevant knowledge within and beyond the science system to meet challenges to sustainability arising in the Anthropocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/institute-advanced-sustainability-studies|title=Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies - IASS Potsdam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cooperation ==
The IASS collaborates with numerous partners in Germany and abroad. Its major regional partners include the University of Potsdam, [[GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences]], a research centre operated by the [[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]], and [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]].

[[Image:Jackshaft two belt pulleys.png|thumb|A two-pulley jackshaft redirecting belt power from horizontal to vertical.]]

A '''jackshaft''', also called a ''countershaft'', is a common mechanical design component used to transfer or synchronize rotational force in a machine. A jackshaft is often just a short stub with supporting bearings on the ends and two pulleys, gears, or cranks attached to it.  In general, a jackshaft is any shaft that is used as an intermediary transmitting [[Horsepower|power]] from a driving shaft to a driven shaft.

==History==
===Jackshaft===
The oldest uses of the term ''jackshaft'' appear to involve shafts that were intermediate between [[water wheel]]s or [[stationary steam engine]]s and the [[line shaft]]s of 19th century mills.&lt;ref&gt;James Emerson, Report of Water-Wheel Tests at Lowell and Other Places, [https://books.google.com/books?id=S3FDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA177 Journal of the Franklin Institute], Vol. LXIII, No. 3 (March, 1872); pages 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holyoke Warter Power Co., Experiments with Gears, Belts and Draft Tubes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HD1EAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA73 Holyoke Hydrodynamic Experiments], Weaver Shipman and Co., Springfield, Mass., 1880; pages 73-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  In these early sources from [[New England]] mills in 1872 and 1880, the term ''"jack shaft"'' always appears in quotes.  Another 1872 author wrote "Gear wheels are used in England to transmit the power of the engine to what is usually called the jack shaft."&lt;ref name="Sellers1872"&gt;Coleman Sellers, Transmission of Motion, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XNgGAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 Journal of the Franklin Institute], Vol. LXIV, No. 5 (Nov. 1872); pages 305-319, ''countershaft'' is defined on page 314, ''jack shaft'' on page 316.&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1892, the quotes were gone, but the use remained the same.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Grimshaw, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJcPAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA224Rope Drive for Power Transmission], [[Cassier's Magazine]] Vol. II, No. 9 (July 1892); pages 219-224, see particularly figure 1 and the discussion of it on pages 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pulleys on the jackshafts of mills or power plants were frequently connected to the shaft with [[clutch]]es.  For example, in the 1890s, the generating room of the Virginia Hotel in Chicago had two [[Corliss engine]]s and five [[dynamo]]s, linked through a jackshaft.  Clutches on the jackshaft pulleys allowed any or all of the dynamos to be driven by either or both of the engines.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Flather, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q5dKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=42 Rope-Driving:  A treatise on the transmission of power by means of fibrous ropes], Wiley, New York, 1895; pages 42-43. Fig. 21 shows part of the jack-shaft.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advent of [[Chain drive#Automobiles|chain-drive vehicles]], the term ''jackshaft'' was generally applied to the final intermediate shaft in the drive train, either a chain driven shaft driving pinions that directly engaged teeth on the inside of the rims of the drive wheels,&lt;ref&gt;The Darling Steam Carriage, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5IVMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA316 The Horseless Age], Vol. 5, No. 2 (Oct. 11, 1899); page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some New American Steam Carriages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ojofAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA565 The Motor Car Journal], Vol I, No. 36 (Nov. 10, 1899); page 565.&lt;/ref&gt; or the output shaft of the transmission/differential that is linked by chain to the drive wheels.&lt;ref&gt;The Grout Steam Tonneau, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J0eOQXpW6MEC&amp;pg=PA55 Cycle and Automobile Trade Journal] Vol II, No. 8 (Feb 1, 1902) ;pages 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first uses of the term ''jackshaft'' in the context of railroad equipment was in an 1890 patent application by Samuel Mower.  In his electric-motor driven [[railroad truck]], the motor was geared to a jackshaft mounted between the side frames.  A sliding [[Dog clutch]] inside the jackshaft was used to select one of several gear ratios on the chain drive to the driven axle.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel E. Mower, Electric-Motor Mechanism, {{US patent|450970}}, issued Apr. 21, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later railroad jackshafts were generally connected to the driving wheels using [[side rod]]s; see [[Jackshaft (locomotive)]] for details.
===Countershaft===
The term ''countershaft'' is somewhat older.  In 1828, the term was used to refer to an intermediate horizontal shaft in a [[gristmill]] driven through gearing by the [[waterwheel]] and driving the [[millstones]] through bevel gears.&lt;ref&gt;James Hindman and William Hindman, Improvement in the Grist Mill, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xaM1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA324 The American Journal of Improvements in the Useful Arts and Mirror of the Patent Office in the United States], Vol I, No. 3 (July, Aug. and Sept. 1828); page 324.  This reads like a patent application, there is no record of a corresponding patent.&lt;/ref&gt;  An 1841 textbook used the term to refer to a short shaft driven by a [[Belt drive|belt]] from the [[line shaft]] and driving the spindle of a [[Lathe (metal)|lathe]] through additional belts.  The countershaft and the lathe spindle each carried cones of different-diameter [[pulley]]s for speed control.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Willis, Part the Third, Chapter II -- To Alter the Velocity Ratio by Determinate Changes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty84AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA433 Principles of Mechanism Designed for the Use of Students in the Universities and for Engineering Students Generally], John W. Parker, London, 1841; page 433.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1872, this definition was given:  "The term countershaft is applied to all shafts driven from the main line &lt;nowiki&gt;[shaft]&lt;/nowiki&gt; when placed at or near the machines to be driven ..."&lt;ref name="Sellers1872" /&gt;
;Modern uses
Modern jackshafts and countershafts are often hidden inside large machinery as components of the larger overall device.

[[Image:TractorPTOshaftMay04.jpg|thumb|A PTO Shaft or jackshaft with a protective shield to prevent entanglement.]]
In farm equipment, a spinning output shaft on the rear of the vehicle is commonly referred to as the ''[[power take-off|Power Take-Off]]'' or PTO, and the power-transfer shaft that is connected to it is commonly called a ''PTO shaft'', but is also a jackshaft.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3809">'''Josette Rey-Debove''', born November 16, 1929 in Calais (Pas-de-Calais), France and died February 22, 2005 in [[Senegal]], was a [[lexicographer]] and [[semiologist]], wife and colleague of Alain Rey. She was the first female lexicographer in France, and held many prominent posts in this field, where she used her influence to promote [[feminist]] changes to French language usage.

== Early career ==
A graduate of the [[University of Sorbonne]], with a doctorate of linguistics, she began her career in 1952 as a lecturer of French at the College of Paris. The following year, she became an editor of language dictionaries at the Société du Nouveau Littré. She subsequently worked at Dictionnaires Le Robert, the most prominent publisher of dictionaries in the French language. It was there that she met Alain Rey, whom she married on September 11, 1954.

She contributed to dictionaries for [[Dictionnaires Le Robert]], collaborating on the Petit Robert for the French language, at Robert des Enfants (the company's division for publishing the Children's Robert dictionaries), then to Dictionnaire du français (foreign language edition) and to Robert Méthodique-Brio. In 1977, she became secretary-general of Dictionnaires Le Robert, a position she held until 1994.

==Influence==
A well-known linguist who promoted feminist changes to French usage, she was named to various commissions to develop the standards of the  language : the Commission de la féminisation du vocabulaire au ministère des droits de la femme between 1984 et 1985, the Commission d'expertise pour la réforme de l'orthographe au Conseil supérieur de la langue française in 1989, the Commission d'orientation pour la simplification du language administratif au ministère de la Fonction publique et de la Réforme de l'État in 2001, the Office québécois de la langue française sur la terminologie, la néologie et la méthodologie du travail terminologique during the 1970s.

She was also a professor of lexicology and semiology at the University Paris III-Sorbonne Nouvelle throughout the 1970s, subsequently at the University Paris VII-Denis Diderot during the 1980s, and at the École des hautes études en sciences sociales beginning in 2002. A friend of many of the members of [[Oulipo]] (Bernard Cerquiglini, Paul Fournel), she was their visiting scholar in 1986.

The '''''Journal des sçavans''''' (later renamed '''''Journal des savans''''' and then '''''Journal des savants'''''), established by [[Denis de Sallo]], was the earliest [[academic journal]] published in Europe. Its content included obituaries of famous men, church history, and legal reports.&lt;ref name="Dibner"&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/libraries/Dibner/newacq_2000.htm The Amsterdam printing of the Journal des sçavans], Dibner Library of the Smithsonian Institution&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue appeared as a twelve-page [[quarto]] [[pamphlet]]&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 1972, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; on Monday, 5 January 1665.&lt;ref&gt;Hallam, 1842, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; This was shortly before the first appearance of the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]],'' on 6 March 1665.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Partridge|first1=Linda|title=Celebrating 350 years of Philosophical Transactions: life sciences papers|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/370/1666/20140380|website=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=3 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308184012/http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/370/1666/20140380|archivedate=March 8, 2015|page=1|language=en|doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0380|date=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th-century French physician and [[Encyclopédistes|encyclopédiste]] [[Louis-Anne La Virotte]] (1725–1759) was introduced to the journal through the protection of chancellor [[Henri François d'Aguesseau]].

The journal ceased publication in 1792, during the [[French Revolution]], and, although it very briefly reappeared in 1797 under the updated title ''Journal des savants'', it did not re-commence regular publication until 1816. From then on, the ''Journal des savants'' was published under the patronage of the Institut de France. From 1908, it was published under the patronage of the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]]. It continues to be a leading academic journal in the [[humanities]].

[[File:Coat of arms of Pope Pius X.svg|thumb|140px|Coat of Arms of Pope Saint [[Pope Pius X|Pius X]]]]
'''''Lamentabili sane exitu''''' ("with truly lamentable results") is a 1907 [[syllabus]], prepared by the [[Roman Inquisition]] and confirmed by Pope [[Pius X]], which condemns errors in the exegesis of [[Religious text|Holy Scripture]] and in the history and interpretation of dogma.&lt;ref&gt;''The Scripture documents: an anthology of official Catholic teachings'' by Dean Philip Béchard 2002 {{ISBN|0-8146-2591-6}} page 183&lt;/ref&gt; The syllabus itself does not use the term 'modernist', but was regarded as part of the Pope's campaign against [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|modernism]] in general and philosophical evolutionism in particular. The document (items 46 and 47) specifically affirmed that the [[Sacrament of Reconciliation]] was instituted by [[Jesus]] himself, as in the [[Gospel of John]] {{bibleverse-nb||John|20:22-23|NIV}}.

Published in July 1907, ''Lamentabili'' was soon to be complemented by the more comprehensive encyclical ''[[Pascendi dominici gregis]]'', which came out in September 1907 and had been prepared in a small circle around the Pope, whereas the 1910 antimodernist oath [[Sacrorum Antistitum]] was again compiled in the Holy Office. Most of the condemned statements in ''Lamentabili'' were taken from the writings of [[Alfred Loisy]] and his school. Other Modernists like [[George Tyrrell]] were targeted only indirectly.

==Propositions condemned==
1. The ecclesiastical law that prescribes that books concerning the Divine Scriptures are subject to previous examination does not apply to critical scholars and students of scientific [[exegesis]] of the Old and New Testament.

2. The Church's interpretation of the Sacred Books is by no means to be rejected; nevertheless, it is subject to the more accurate judgment and correction of the [[exegesis|exegetes]].

3. From the ecclesiastical judgments and censures passed against free and more scientific exegesis, one can conclude that the Faith the Church proposes contradicts history and that Catholic teaching cannot really be reconciled with the true origins of the Christian religion.

4. Even by dogmatic definitions the Church's [[magisterium]] cannot determine the genuine sense of the Sacred Scriptures.

5. Since the deposit of Faith contains only revealed truths, the Church has no right to pass judgment on the assertions of the human sciences.

6. The "Church learning" and the "Church teaching" collaborate in such a way in defining truths that it only remains for the "Church teaching" to sanction the opinions of the "Church learning." 
{{Penance and Reconciliation|small=y}}
7. In proscribing errors, the Church cannot demand any internal assent from the faithful by which the judgments she issues are to be embraced.

8. They are free from all blame who treat lightly the condemnations passed by the [[Sacred Congregation of the Index]] or by the Roman Congregations.

9. They display excessive simplicity or ignorance who believe that God is really the author of the Sacred Scriptures.

10. The inspiration of the books of the [[Old Testament]] consists in this: The Israelite writers handed down religious doctrines under a peculiar aspect that was either little or not at all known to the Gentiles.

11. Divine inspiration does not extend to all of Sacred Scriptures so that it renders its parts, each and every one, free from every error.

12. If he wishes to apply himself usefully to Biblical studies, the exegete must first put aside all preconceived opinions about the supernatural origin of Sacred Scripture and interpret it the same as any other merely human document.

13. The Evangelists themselves, as well as the Christians of the second and third generation, artificially arranged the evangelical parables. In such a way they explained the scanty fruit of the preaching of Christ among the Jews.

14. In many narrations the Evangelists recorded, not so much things that are true, as things which, even though false, they judged to be more profitable for their readers.

15. Until the time the canon was defined and constituted, the [[Gospel#Canonical gospels|Gospels]] were increased by additions and corrections. Therefore, there remained in them only a faint and uncertain trace of the doctrine of Christ.

16. The narrations of John are not properly history, but a mystical contemplation of the Gospel. The discourses contained in his Gospel are theological meditations, lacking historical truth concerning the mystery of salvation.

17. The [[Gospel of John|fourth Gospel]] exaggerated miracles not only in order that the extraordinary might stand out but also in order that it might become more suitable for showing forth the work and glory of the Word Incarnate.

18. John claims for himself the quality of witness concerning Christ. In reality, however, he is only a distinguished witness of the Christian life, or of the life of Christ in the Church at the close of the first century.

19. [[Heterodoxy|Heterodox]] exegetes have expressed the true sense of the Scriptures more faithfully than Catholic exegetes.

20. Revelation could be nothing else than the consciousness man acquired of his revelation to God.

21. Revelation, constituting the object of the Catholic faith, was not completed with the Apostles.

22. The dogmas the Church holds out as revealed are not truths that have fallen from heaven. They are an interpretation of religious facts the human mind has acquired by laborious effort.

23. Opposition may, and actually does, exist between the facts narrated in Sacred Scripture and the Church's dogmas that rest on them. Thus the critic may reject as false facts the Church holds as most certain.

24. The exegete who constructs premises from which it follows that dogmas are historically false or doubtful is not to be reproved as long as he does not directly deny the dogmas themselves.

25. The assent of faith ultimately rests on a mass of probabilities.

26. The dogmas of the Faith are to be held only according to their practical sense; that is to say, as preceptive norms of conduct and not as norms of believing.

27. The divinity of Jesus Christ is not proved from the Gospels. It is a dogma the Christian conscience has derived from the notion of the Messiahs.

28. While He was exercising His ministry, Jesus did not speak with the object of teaching He was the Messiah, nor did His miracles tend to prove it.

29. It is permissible to grant that the Christ of history is far inferior to the Christ Who is the object of faith.

30 In all the evangelical texts the name "Son of God" is equivalent only to that of "Messiah". It does not in the least way signify that Christ is the true and natural Son of God.

31. The doctrine concerning Christ taught by [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], John, and the [[First Council of Nicaea|Councils of Nicea]], [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] and [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] is not what Jesus taught, but what the Christian conscience conceived concerning Jesus.

32. It is impossible to reconcile the natural sense of the Gospel texts with the sense taught by our theologians concerning the conscience and the infallible knowledge of Jesus Christ.

33 Everyone who is not led by preconceived opinions can readily see that either Jesus professed an error concerning the immediate Messianic coming or the greater part of His doctrine as contained in the Gospels is destitute of authenticity.

34. The critics can ascribe to Christ a knowledge without limits only on a hypothesis that cannot be historically conceived and that is repugnant to the moral sense. That hypothesis is that Christ as man possessed the knowledge of God and yet was unwilling to communicate the knowledge of a great many things to His disciples and posterity.

35. Christ did not always possess the consciousness of His Messianic dignity.

36. The Resurrection of the Savior is not properly a fact of the historical order. It is a fact of merely the supernatural order (neither demonstrated nor demonstrable) that the Christian conscience gradually derived from other facts.

37. In the beginning, faith in the Resurrection of Christ was not so much in the fact itself of the Resurrection as in the immortal life of Christ with God.

38. The doctrine of the expiatory death of Christ is Pauline and not evangelical.

39. The opinions concerning the origin of the Sacraments, which the Fathers of Trent held and which certainly influenced their dogmatic canons, are very different from those that now rightly exist among historians who examine Christianity .

40. [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|The Sacraments]] have their origin in the fact that the Apostles and their successors, swayed and moved by circumstances and events, interpreted some idea and intention of Christ.

41. The Sacraments are intended merely to recall to man's mind the ever-beneficent presence of the Creator.

42. The Christian community imposed the necessity of Baptism, adopted it as a necessary rite, and added to it the obligation of the Christian profession.

43. The practice of administering Baptism to infants was a disciplinary evolution, which became one of the causes why the Sacrament was divided into two, namely, Baptism and Penance.

44. There is nothing to prove that the rite of the Sacrament of Confirmation was employed by the Apostles. The formal distinction of the two Sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation does not pertain to the history of primitive Christianity.

45. Not everything Paul narrates concerning the institution of the Eucharist ({{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|11:23-25|NIV}}) is to be taken historically.

46. In the primitive Church the concept of the Christian sinner reconciled by the authority of the Church did not exist. Only very slowly did the Church accustom herself to this concept. As a matter of fact, even after Penance was recognized as an institution of the Church, it was not called a Sacrament since it would be held as a disgraceful Sacrament.

47. The words of the Lord, "Receive the Holy Spirit; whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained'' ({{Bibleverse||John|20:22-23|NIV}}), in no way refer to the Sacrament of Penance, in spite of what it pleased the Fathers of Trent to say.

48. In his Epistle ({{Bibleverse||James|5:14-15|NIV}}) James did not intend to promulgate a Sacrament of Christ but only commend a pious custom. If in this custom he happens to distinguish a means of grace, it is not in that rigorous manner in which it was taken by the theologians who laid down the notion and number of the Sacraments.

49. When the Christian supper gradually assumed the nature of a liturgical action those who customarily presided over the supper acquired the sacerdotal character.

50. The elders who fulfilled the office of watching over the gatherings of the faithful were instituted by the Apostles as priests or bishops to provide for the necessary ordering of the increasing communities and not properly for the perpetuation of the Apostolic mission and power.

51. It is impossible that Matrimony could have become a Sacrament of the new law until later in the Church since it was necessary that a full theological explication of the doctrine of grace and the Sacraments should first take place before Matrimony should be held as a Sacrament.

52. It was far from the mind of Christ to found a Church as a society that would continue on earth for a long course of centuries. On the contrary, in the mind of Christ the kingdom of heaven together with the end of the world was about to come immediately.

53. The organic constitution of the Church is not immutable. Like human society, Christian society is subject to a perpetual evolution.

54. Dogmas, Sacraments and hierarchy, both their notion and reality, are only interpretations and evolutions of the Christian intelligence, which have increased and perfected, by an external series of additions, the little germ latent in the Gospel.

55. Simon Peter never suspected that Christ entrusted the primacy in the Church to him.

56. The Roman Church became the head of all the churches, not through the ordinance of Divine Providence, but merely through political conditions.

57. The Church has shown that she is hostile to the progress of the natural and theological sciences.

58. Truth is no more immutable than man himself, since it evolved with him, in him, and through him.

59. Christ did not teach a determined body of doctrine applicable to all times and all men, but rather inaugurated a religious movement adapted or to be adapted to different times and places.

60. Christian Doctrine was originally Judaic. Through successive evolutions it became first [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline]], then [[Johannine Christianity|Joannine]], finally Hellenic and universal.

61. It may be said without paradox that there is no chapter of Scripture, from the first of Genesis to the last of the Apocalypse, that contains a doctrine absolutely identical to what the Church teaches on the same matter. For the same reason, therefore, no chapter of Scripture has the same sense for the critic and the theologian.

62. The chief articles of the [[Apostles' Creed]] did not have the same sense for the Christians of the first ages as they have for the Christians of our time.

63. The Church shows that she is incapable of effectively maintaining evangelical ethics since she obstinately clings to immutable doctrines that cannot be reconciled with modern progress.

64. Scientific progress demands that concepts of Christian doctrine concerning God, creation, revelation, the Person of the Incarnate Word, and Redemption be re-adjusted.

65. Modern Catholicism can be reconciled with true science only if it is transformed into a non-dogmatic Christianity; that is to say, into a broad and liberal Protestantism.

A '''low-carbon economy''' ('''LCE'''), '''low-fossil-fuel economy''' ('''LFFE'''),&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://nanoparis.blogspot.com/2006/03/dye-sensitized-solar-cells.html Nanomech in Photovoltaics: Dye Sensitized Solar Cells&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''decarbonised economy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/news/Decarbonised-Economy1/|title=Decarbonised Economy|work=Greenpeace India|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[economy]] based on [[low carbon power]] sources that therefore has a minimal output of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions into the [[biosphere]], but specifically refers to the greenhouse gas [[carbon dioxide]]. GHG emissions due to anthropogenic (human) activity are the dominant cause of observed [[global warming]] ([[climate change]]) since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf |title= IPCC, 2014: Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report.

Shifting to low-carbon economy on a global scale could bring substantial benefits both for developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Koh, Jae Myong (2018). ''Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects''. London: Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-3-319-71769-2}}. &lt;/ref&gt; Many countries around the world are designing and implementing low emission development strategies (LEDS). These strategies seek to achieve social, economic and environmental development goals while reducing long-term greenhouse gas emissions and increasing resilience to climate change impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CDKN_LEDS_global_factsheet.pdf|title=LEDS GP factsheet|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally implemented low-carbon economies are therefore proposed by those having drawn this conclusion, as a means to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid catastrophic climate change]], and as a precursor to the more advanced, zero-carbon economy.

==Rationale and aims==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
Nations may seek to become low-carbon or decarbonised economies as a part of a national [[climate change mitigation]] strategy.  A comprehensive strategy to mitigate [[climate change]] is through [[carbon neutrality]].

The aim of a LCE is to integrate all aspects of itself from its manufacturing, agriculture, transportation, and power-generation, etc. around technologies that produce energy and materials with little GHG emission, and, thus, around populations, buildings, machines, and devices that use those energies and materials efficiently, and, dispose of or recycle its wastes so as to have a minimal output of GHGs. Furthermore, it has been proposed that to make the transition to an LCE economically viable we would have to attribute a cost (per unit output) to GHGs through means such as [[emissions trading]] and/or a [[carbon tax]].

Some nations are presently low carbon: societies that are not heavily industrialised or populated. In order to avoid climate change on a global level, all nations considered [[carbon intensity|carbon intensive]] societies, and societies that are heavily populated might have to become zero-carbon societies and economies. Several of these countries{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} have pledged to cut their emissions by 100% via [[Carbon offset|offset]]ting emissions rather than ceasing all emissions ([[carbon neutrality]]); in other words, emitting will not cease but will continue and will be ''offset'' to a different geographical area. EU emission trading system allows companies to buy international carbon credits, thus the companies can channel clean technologies to promote other countries to adopt low-carbon developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The EU Emission Trading System(EU ETS) Factsheet |url=http://ec.europa.eu/clima/publications/docs/factsheet_ets_en.pdf |website=European Commission |publisher=European Union |accessdate=27 Oct 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715223057/http://ec.europa.eu/clima/publications/docs/factsheet_ets_en.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of low-carbon economies===
Low-carbon economies present multiple benefits to ecosystem resilience, trade, employment, health, energy security, and industrial competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/2016/06/presenting-co-benefits-of-leds/?loclang=en_gb|title=Presenting the benefits of low emission development strategies|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Benefits to ecosystem resilience====
Low emission development strategies for the land use sector can prioritize the protection of carbon rich ecosystems to not only reduce emissions, but also to protect [[biodiversity]] and safeguard local livelihoods to reduce rural poverty - all of which can lead to more climate resilient systems, according to a report by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]. [[REDD+]] and blue carbon initiatives are among the measures available to conserve, sustainably manage, and restore these carbon rich ecosystems, which are crucial for natural carbon storage and sequestration, and for building climate resilient communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-boost-ecosystem-resilience/?loclang=en_gb|title=Boost ecosystem resilience to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Job creation====
Transitioning to a low-carbon, environmentally and socially sustainable economies can become a strong driver of job creation, job upgrading, social justice, and poverty eradication if properly managed with the full engagement of governments, workers, and employers’ organizations.&lt;ref name="ledsgp.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-green-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=Create green jobs to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates from the [[International Labour Organization]]’s Global Economic Linkages model suggest that unmitigated climate change, with associated negative impacts on enterprises and workers, will have negative effects on output in many industries, with drops in output of 2.4% by 2030 and 7.2% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/docs/WCMS_192582/lang--en/index.htm|title=Global Economic Linkages Model|publisher=[[International Labour Organization]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transitioning to a low-carbon economy will cause shifts in the volume, composition, and quality of employment across sectors and will affect the level and distribution of income. Research indicates that eight sectors employing around 1.5 billion workers, approximately half the global workforce, will undergo major changes: agriculture, forestry, fishing, energy, resource intensive manufacturing, recycling, buildings, and transport.&lt;ref name="ledsgp.org"/&gt;

====Business competitiveness====
Low emission industrial development and [[resource efficiency]] can offer many opportunities to increase the competitiveness of economies and companies. According to the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], there is often a clear business case for switching to lower emission technologies, with payback periods ranging largely from 0.5–5 years, leveraging financial investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-gain-competitive-edge/?loclang=en_gb|title=Gain the competitive edge to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Improved trade policy====
Trade and trade policies can contribute to low-carbon economies by enabling more efficient use of resources and international exchange of climate friendly goods and services. Removing tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade in [[clean energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] technologies is one such measure. In a sector where finished products consist of many components that cross borders numerous times - a typical [[wind turbine]], for example, contains up to 8,000 components - even small tariff cuts would reduce costs. This would make the technologies more affordable and competitive in the global market, particularly when combined with a phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-use-trade-policy/?loclang=en_gb|title=Use trade policy to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy policy===

====Renewable energy and energy efficiency====
{{See also|Renewable energy commercialization}}
[[Image:Total Installed Wind Capacity 1997-2020-MW.jpg|thumb|Worldwide installed wind power capacity 1997–2020 [MW], history and predictions. Data source: [http://www.wwindea.org/ WWEA]]]

Recent advances in technology and policy will allow [[renewable energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] to play major roles in displacing fossil fuels, meeting global energy demand while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Renewable energy technologies are being rapidly commercialized and, in conjunction with efficiency gains, can achieve far greater emissions reductions than either could independently.&lt;ref name=wwinst2009&gt;Janet L. Sawin and William R. Moomaw. [http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/Renewable%20Revolution.pdf Renewable Revolution:Low-Carbon Energy by 2030] Worldwatch Report, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy is [[energy]] that comes from [[natural resource]]s such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal energy|tides]], and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]], which are [[Renewable resource|renewable]] (naturally replenished). In 2008, about 19% of global final energy consumption came from renewables.&lt;ref name=r2010&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=August 20, 2010 }} p. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; During the five years from the end of 2004 through 2009, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies. For wind power and many other renewable technologies, growth accelerated in 2009 relative to the previous four years.&lt;ref name=ren15/&gt; More wind power capacity was added during 2009 than any other renewable technology. However, grid-connected [[photovoltaics]] increased the fastest of all renewables technologies, with a 60 percent annual average growth rate for the five-year period.&lt;ref name=ren15&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=August 20, 2010 }} p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy for power, heat, cooling, and mobility is the key ingredient for development and growth, with energy security a prerequisite economic growth, making it arguably the most important driver for energy policy. Scaling up renewable energy as part of a low emission development strategy can diversify a country's energy mixes and reduces dependence on imports. It can also lower geopolitical risks and exposure to fuel price volatility, and improve the balance of trade for importing countries (noting that only a handful of countries export oil and gas). Renewable energy offers lower financial and economic risk for businesses through a more stable and predictable cost base for energy supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-ensure-energy-security/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Ensure energy security to realize the benefits of low emission development|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficiency gains in recent decades have been significant, but there is still much more that can be achieved. With a concerted effort and strong policies in place, future energy efficiency improvements are likely to be very large. Heat is one of many forms of "energy wastage" that could be captured to significantly increase useful energy without burning more fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=wwinst2009/&gt;

====Sustainable biofuels====
{{Main|Sustainable biofuel}}
[[Biofuels]], in the form of [[liquid fuels]] derived from plant materials, are entering the market, driven by factors such as [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price spikes]] and the need for increased [[energy security]]. However, many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the [[natural environment]], [[food security]], and [[land use]].&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;&lt;ref name=sol/&gt;

The challenge is to support biofuel development, including the development of new [[Cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic technologies]], with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is [[sustainable]]. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;[[The Royal Society]] (January 2008). ''Sustainable biofuels: prospects and challenges'',  {{ISBN|978-0-85403-662-2}}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sol&gt;Gordon Quaiattini. [http://www.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=e08c8e19-4a95-491c-9386-d30afeab5cdf&amp;sponsor= Biofuels are part of the solution]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Canada.com'', April 25, 2008. Retrieved December 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPFL Energy Center (c2007). ''[http://www.webcitation.org/5luiZYDX8?url=http://www.its.berkeley.edu/sustainabilitycenter/RSB_Intro.pdf Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels]'' Retrieved December 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. However, they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation. A healthy supply of [[alternative energy]] sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on [[fossil fuel]]s, especially in the transport sector.&lt;ref name=sol/&gt; Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a [[sustainable transport]] strategy.

====Nuclear power====
[[Nuclear power]] has been offered as the primary means to achieve a LCE. In terms of large [[industrialized]] nations, mainland France, due primarily to [[nuclear power in France|75% of its electricity being produced by nuclear power]], has the [[List of countries by ratio of GDP to carbon dioxide emissions|lowest carbon dioxide production]] per unit of [[GDP]] in the world and it is the [[List of countries by electricity exports|largest exporter of electricity in the world]], earning it approximately €3 billion annually in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessandfinance.ie/index.jsp?p=164&amp;n=397&amp;a=1565|title=Privacy policy|work=Business &amp; Finance|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302010428/http://www.businessandfinance.ie/index.jsp?p=164&amp;n=397&amp;a=1565|archivedate=2 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern is often expressed with the matter of spent nuclear fuel storage and security; although the physical issues are not large, the political difficulties are significant. The [[liquid fluoride thorium reactor]] (LFTR) has been suggested as a solution to the concerns posed by conventional nuclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = N. | last2 = Minakata | first2 = D. | last3 = Begovic | first3 = M. | last4 = Crittenden | first4 = J. | title = Should We Consider Using Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors for Power Generation? | doi = 10.1021/es2021318 | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 45 | issue = 15 | pages = 6237 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2011EnST...45.6237C }} "LFTR can mean a 1000+ year solution or a quality low-carbon bridge to truly [[sustainable energy]] sources solving a huge portion of mankind’s negative [[environmental impact]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

France reprocesses their spent nuclear fuel at the [[La Hague site]] since 1976 and has also treated spent nuclear fuel from France, Japan, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands.

====Smart grid====
One proposal from Karlsruhe University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR8gEMpzos4|title=Fully renewable: biogas + wind + solar|date=29 December 2007|work=YouTube|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kombikraftwerk.de/index.php?id=27 Combined Power Plant&lt;/ref&gt; developed as a virtual power station is the use of solar and wind energy for base load with hydro and biogas for make up or peak load. Hydro and biogas are used as [[grid energy storage]]. This requires the development of a smart intelligent grid hopefully including local power networks than use energy near the site of production, thereby reducing the existing 5% grid loss.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=105&amp;t=3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon-neutral hydrocarbons===
{{main|Carbon-neutral fuel}}

====Methane cycle====
A further development of this is the use of the carbon capture, hydrogen and its conversion into methane (SNG synthetic natural gas) to act as a storage for intermittent renewables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-kassel.de/upress/online/frei/978-3-89958-798-2.volltext.frei.pdf Bioenergy and renewable power methane in integrated 100% renewable energy system]&lt;/ref&gt;

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Sabatier reaction

This involves the use of the existing natural gas (methane) grid as the store. In this case, the carbon dioxide is given economic value as a component of energy carrier. This "solar fuel"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solar-fuel.net/en/the-challenge|title=Solar Fuel|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; cycle uses the excess electrical renewable energy that cannot be used instantaneously in the grid, which otherwise would be wasted to create hydrogen via electrolysis of water. The hydrogen is then combined with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to create synthetic or substitute natural gas SNG and stored in the natural gas network. The natural gas is used to create electrical energy (and the heat used as well in CHP) on demand when there is not enough sun (photovoltaic, CSP...) or wind (turbines) or water (hydro, ocean current, waves,...).  The German natural gas grid, for example, has two months of storage, more than enough to outlast renewable energy low production points.

====Ocean derived hydrocarbon fuels====
The concentration of [[Ocean acidification|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the upper layer of the world's oceans]] is higher than is found in air, and thus it is the most concentrated "[[mining|mine]]" from which zero-net carbon fuels can be produced. The U.S. Navy estimates that a typical nuclear propelled aircraft carrier [[A4W reactor|which generates 100 megawatts]] of electricity can produce 41,000 [[US gallon]]s(155,202 [[litre]]s) of [[jet fuel]] per day and production from the onboard nuclear reactor would cost about $6 per gallon($1.58 per liter). While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010, it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue. Moreover, since the delivery of fuel to a [[carrier battle group]] costs about $8 per gallon, shipboard production is already much less expensive.&lt;ref name="jetsea"&gt;{{Cite report |last=Willauer |first=Heather D. |last2=Hardy |first2=Dennis R. |last3=Williams |first3=Frederick W. |date=September 29, 2010 |title=''Feasibility and Current Estimated Capital Costs of Producing Jet Fuel at Sea'' |publisher=Chemistry Division, Navy Technology Center for Safety and Survivability, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory |location=Washington, DC |type=memorandum report |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA539765 |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heather Willauer]] of the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] proof-tested the technology in 2013, fueling an internal combustion engine equipped [[model airplane]] with the [[synthetic fuel]].&lt;ref name=Parry2014&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nrl.navy.mil/media/news-releases/2014/scale-model-wwii-craft-takes-flight-with-fuel-from-the-sea-concept |title=Scale Model WWII Craft Takes Flight With Fuel From the Sea Concept |last=Parry |first=Daniel |date=April 7, 2014 |work=Naval Research Laboratory News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carbon capture and storage ====
The proposed strategy of [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) - continued use of non-renewable fossil fuels but without allowing carbon dioxide to reach the atmosphere - has also been considered as a means to achieve a LCE, either in a primary or supporting role. Major concerns include the uncertainty of costs and time needed to successfully implement CCS worldwide and with guarantees that stored emissions will not leak into the [[biosphere]].

====Combined heat and power====

[[Cogeneration|Combined Heat and Power]] (CHP) is a technology which by allowing the more efficient use of fuel will at least reduce carbon emissions; should the fuel be [[biomass]] or [[biogas]] or hydrogen used as an energy store then in principle it can be a zero carbon option. CHP can also be used with a nuclear reactor as the energy source; there are examples of such installations in the far North of the Russian Federation.

==Primary sector==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Low carbon diet}}

Most of the agricultural facilities in the developed world are mechanized due to rural electrification.  Rural electrification has produced significant productivity gains, but it also uses a lot of energy.  For this and other reasons (such as transport costs) in a low-carbon society, rural areas would need available supplies of renewably produced electricity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Irrigation can be one of the main components of an agricultural facility's energy consumption.  In parts of California, it can be up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fypower.org/agri/|title=Thank You|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the low carbon economy, irrigation equipment will be maintained and continuously updated and farms will use less irrigation water.

====Crops====
Different crops require different amounts of energy input.  For example, glasshouse crops, irrigated crops, and orchards require a lot of energy to maintain, while row crops and field crops do not need as much maintenance.  Those glasshouse and irrigated crops that do exist will incorporate the following improvements:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;New Zealand Energy Intensive Business Initiative, {{cite web |url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/climate/policies-initiatives/energy-pilot-scheme.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927232041/http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/climate/policies-initiatives/energy-pilot-scheme.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glasshouse crops
*environmental control systems
*heat recovery using condensers
*heat storage using buffer tanks
*heat retention using thermal screens
*alternative fuels (e.g., waste wood and trees)
*cogeneration (heat and power)
Irrigated arable crops
*soil moisture measurement to regulate irrigation
*variable-speed drives on pumps

====Livestock====
Livestock operations can also use a lot of energy depending on how they are run.  Feed lots use animal feed made from corn, soybeans, and other crops.  Energy must be expended to produce these crops, process, and transport them.  Free-range animals find their own vegetation to feed on.  The farmer may expend energy to take care of that vegetation, but not nearly as much as the farmer growing cereal and oil-seed crops.

Many livestock operations currently use a lot of energy to water their livestock.  In the low-carbon economy, such operations will use more water conservation methods such as rainwater collection, water cisterns, etc., and they will also pump/distribute that water with on-site renewable energy sources (most likely wind and solar).

Due to rural electrification, most agricultural facilities in the developed world use a lot of electricity.  In a low-carbon economy, farms will be run and equipped to allow for greater energy efficiency.  The dairy industry, for example, will incorporate the following changes:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Irrigated Dairy
*heat recovery on milk vats
*variable speed drives on motors/pumps
*heat recovery from hot water wash
*soil moisture measurement to regulate irrigation
*biodigester with cogen (heat &amp; power)
*vat wrap
*solar water heating
*ripple control
*ice bank
*chemical substitute for hot-water wash

===Hunting and fishing===
Fishing is quite energy intensive.  Improvements such as heat recovery on refrigeration and trawl net technology will be common in the low-carbon economy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}

===Forestry===
{{Main|Wood economy}}
Protecting forests provides integrated benefits to all, ranging from increased food production, safeguarded local livelihoods, protected [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystems]] provided by forests, and reduced rural poverty. Adopting low emission strategies for both agricultural and forest production also mitigates some of the effects of [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CDKN_LEDS_Forestry_WG_factsheet.pdf|title=LEDS GP Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use Working Group factsheet|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the low-carbon economy, forestry operations will be focused on low-impact practices and regrowth.  Forest managers will make sure that they do not disturb soil-based carbon reserves too much.  Specialized tree farms  will be the main source of material for many products.  Quick maturing tree varieties will be grown on short rotations in order to maximize output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm Trees and their role in carbon management for land and business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190041/http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}, The Woodland Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===
{{Main|Gas flare}}
Flaring and venting of [[natural gas]] in oil wells is a significant source of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Its contribution to greenhouse gases has declined by three-quarters in absolute terms since a peak in the 1970s of approximately 110 million metric tons/year, and in 2004 accounted for about 1/2 of one percent of all [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/trends/emis/tre_glob.htm Global, Regional, and National CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Emissions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711043835/http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/trends/emis/tre_glob.htm |date=2007-07-11 }}. In ''Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change'', Marland, G., T.A. Boden, and R. J.

The [[World Bank]] estimates that 134 billion cubic meters of natural gas are flared or vented annually (2010 datum), an amount equivalent to the combined annual gas consumption of [[Germany]] and [[France]] or enough to supply the entire world with gas for 16 days.
This flaring is highly concentrated: 10 countries account for 70% of emissions, and twenty for 85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/gasflaringreduction |title=Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=worldbank.org |publisher=The [[World Bank]] |access-date=August 24, 2016 |quote=previous redirect from web.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top-ten leading contributors to world gas flaring in 2010, were (in declining order): [[Russia]] (26%), [[Nigeria]] (11%), [[Iran]] (8%), [[Iraq]] (7%), [[Algeria]] (4%), [[Angola]] (3%), [[Kazakhstan]] (3%), [[Libya]] (3%), [[Saudi Arabia]] (3%), and [[Venezuela]] (2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTOGMC/EXTGGFR/0,,contentMDK:22137498~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:578069,00.html|title=Global Gas Flaring Reduction - Estimated Flared Volumes from Satellite Data, 2007-2011|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tertiary sector==

===Retail===
Retail operations in the low-carbon economy will have several new features.  One will be high-efficiency lighting such as compact fluorescent, halogen, and eventually LED light sources.  Many retail stores will also feature roof-top solar panel arrays.  These make sense because solar panels produce the most energy during the daytime and during the summer.  These are the same times that electricity is the most expensive and also the same times that stores use the most electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=35633 Grocery Store Sets California Solar Standard], Renewable Energy World, 22 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation services===
Sustainable, low-carbon transport systems are based on minimizing travel and shifting to more environmentally (as well as socially and economically) sustainable mobility, improving transport technologies, fuels and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CDKN_LEDS_transport_WG_factsheet.pdf|title=LEDS GP Transport Working Group factsheet|publisher=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decarbonisation of (urban) mobility by means of:
* More energy efficiency and alternative propulsion:
** Increased focus on fuel efficient vehicle shapes and configurations, with more [[vehicle electrification]], particularly through [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEV) or [[all-electric vehicle]]s
** More alternative and flex-fuel vehicles (based on local conditions and availability)
** Driver training for more fuel efficiency.
** Low-carbon [[biofuel]]s [[cellulosic ethanol|cellulosic]] ([[biodiesel]], [[bioethanol]], [[biobutanol]])
** Petroleum fuel [[fee|surcharge]]s will be a more significant part of consumer costs.
* Less international trade of physical objects, despite more overall trade (as measure by value of goods)
* Greater use of marine and [[electric rail transport]], less use of air and truck transport.
* Increased non-motorised transport (i.e. walking and cycling) and public transport usage, less reliance on private motor vehicles.
* More [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] capacity for common fluid commodities such as water, ethanol, butanol, natural gas, petroleum, and hydrogen (in addition to gasoline and diesel). See&lt;ref&gt;[[Energy Information Administration]] Industry Analysis Briefs, http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/mecs/iab/index5e.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carbon Trust, http://www.carbontrust.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10719.pdf BERR - Redirect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925194653/http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10719.pdf |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable transport has many co-benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], low carbon transport can help create jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Create jobs|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-make-roads-safe/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Make roads safe|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people’s time and household income as well as government budgets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-save-time-money/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Save money and time|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.

===Health services===
There have been some moves to investigate the ways and extent to which health systems contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and how they may need to change to become part of a low-carbon world.  The Sustainable Development Unit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdu.nhs.uk/|title=Sustainable Development Unit|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the NHS in the UK is one of the first official bodies to have been set up in this area, whilst organisations such as the Campaign for Greener Healthcare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenerhealthcare.org/|title=Munin :: overview|author=Auto-generated Munin|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also producing influential changes at a clinical level.   This work includes
* Quantification of where the health services emissions stem from.
* Information on the environmental impacts of alternative models of treatment and service provision
Some of the suggested changes needed are:
* Greater efficiency and lower ecological impact of energy, buildings, and procurement choices (e.g., in-patient meals, pharmaceuticals, and medical equipment).
* A shift from focusing solely on cure to prevention, through the promotion of healthier, lower-carbon lifestyles, e.g. diets lower in red meat and dairy products, walking or cycling wherever possible, better town planning to encourage more outdoor lifestyles.
* Improving public transport and liftsharing options for transport to and from hospitals and clinics.

=== Tourism ===
Low-carbon tourism includes travels with low energy consumption, and low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and pollution emissions. Change of personal behavior to more low-carbon oriented activities is mostly influenced by both individual awareness and attitudes, as well as external social aspect, such as culture and environment. Studies indicate that educational level and occupation influence an individual perception of low-carbon tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Wenjie|last2=Zhang|first2=Xiaolei|last3=Yang|first3=Zhaoping|last4=Wall|first4=Geoffrey|last5=Wang|first5=Fang|date=2017-06-04|title=Creating a low carbon tourism community by public cognition, intention and behaviour change analysisa case study of a heritage site (Tianshan Tianchi, China)|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/geo-2017-0017/geo-2017-0017.xml?format=INT|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=197-210|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0017|issn=2391-5447|via=|bibcode=2017OGeo....9...17W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial steps==
A good overview of the history of international efforts towards a low-carbon economy, from its initial seed at the inaugural UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972, has been given by David Runnals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/1150 Runnals, D. (2011) “Environment and economy: joined at the hip or just strange bed-fellows?”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''4''' (1) ]&lt;/ref&gt;
On the international scene, the most prominent early step in the direction of a low-carbon economy was the signing of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which came into force on February 16, 2005, under which most industrialized countries committed to reduce their carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2050.nies.go.jp/|title=Low-Carbon Society Research Project|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = Towards a low carbon economy | author = Margot Wallström | date = 11 March 2004 | location = Brussels | url = http://www.europaworld.org/week168/speechwalstrom12304.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080921222229/http://www.europaworld.org/week168/speechwalstrom12304.htm | archivedate = 21 September 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, all member nations of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] except the [[Energy policy of the United States|United States]] have ratified the protocol.
Europe is the leading geopolitical continent in defining and mobilising decarbonisation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/climate-change/decarbonisation-challenge-us-european-perspectives/article-162796|title=The decarbonisation challenge - US and European perspectives|work=EurActiv - EU News &amp; policy debates, across languages|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[International Association of Public Transport|UITP]] - an organisation advocating [[sustainable mobility]] and [[public transport]] - has an EU office, but less well developed contacts with, for example, the US. The European Union Committee of the [[International Association of Public Transport|UITP]] wants to promote decarbonisation of urban mobility in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uitp.org/news/pics/pdf/PR_Decarbonisation.pdf|title=News|work=UITP|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Europe is nowadays the leading geopolitical continent with regard to lowering emissions, Europe is quickly losing ground to Asia, with countries such as China and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e3g.org/programmes/europe-articles/financing-the-decarbonisation-of-european-infrastructure|title=E3G — Third Generation Environmentalism - Action on climate and energy|author=E3G, Third Generation Environmentalism|work=E3G - Third Generation Environmentalism|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730155101/http://www.e3g.org/programmes/europe-articles/financing-the-decarbonisation-of-european-infrastructure|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the 2014 ''Global Green Economy Index™ (GGEI)'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://dualcitizeninc.com/GGEI-Report2014.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ranks 60 nations on their green economic performance, finding that the Nordic countries and Switzerland have the best combined performance around climate change and green economy.

===Countries===

====Australia====
{{Main|Renewable energy in Australia}}
Australia has implemented schemes to start the transition to a low-carbon economy but [[carbon neutrality]] has not been mentioned and since the introduction of the schemes, emissions have increased. The [[Second Rudd Government]] pledged to lower emissions by 5-15%. In 2001, The Howard Government introduced a Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) scheme. In 2007, the Government revised the MRET - 20 percent of Australia's electricity supply to come from renewable energy sources by 2020. Renewable energy sources provide 8-10% of the nation's energy, and this figure will increase significantly in the coming years. However coal dependence and exporting conflicts with the concept of Australia as a low-carbon economy. Carbon-neutral businesses have received no incentive; they have voluntarily done so. Carbon-offset companies offer assessments based on lifecycle impacts to businesses that seek carbon neutrality. In Australia the only true certified carbon neutral scheme is the Australian government's National Carbon Offset Standard (NCOS) which includes a mandatory independent audit. Three of the four of Australia's top banks are now certified under this scheme and full list of compliant companies can be seen here http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/carbon-neutral/carbon-neutral-program/accredited-businesses#Certified_organisations . Businesses are now moving from unaccredited schemes such as noco2 and transitioning to NCOS as the only one that is externally audited. Most of leading carbon management companies have also aligned with NCOS such as Net Balance https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125415/http://www.netbalance.com/ , Pangolin Associates (who themselves are independently certified under NCOS) http://pangolinassociates.com/sustainability-services/ncos-carbon-neutrality/, Energetics http://energetics.com.au/home and the big four accounting firms.

In 2011 the Gillard Government introduced a price on carbon dioxide emissions for businesses. Although often characterised as a tax, it lacked the revenue-raising nature of a true tax. In 2013, on the election of the Abbott government, immediate legislative steps were taken to repeal the so-called carbon tax. The price on carbon was repealed on the 17th July 2014 by an act of parliament. As it stands Australia currently has no mechanism to deal with climate change.

====China====
{{Main|Renewable energy in China}}
In [[China]], the city of [[Dongtan, Shanghai|Dongtan]] is to be built to produce zero net greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Chinese State Council announced in 2009 it aimed to cut China's carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 40%-45% in 2020 from 2005 levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2009-11/27/content_9060500.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However carbon dioxide emissions were still increasing by 10% a year by 2013 and China was emitting more carbon dioxide than the next two biggest countries combined (U.S.A. and India).&lt;ref&gt;Borenstein, Seth (12 April 2013) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/greenhouse-gases-make-hig_n_3066775.html China's Carbon Emissions Directly Linked To Rise In Daily Temperature Spikes, Study Finds] The Huffington Post, Retrieved 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Total carbon dioxide emissions were projected to increase until 2030.&lt;ref&gt;

====Iceland====
{{Main|Renewable energy in Iceland}}
Iceland began utilising renewable energy early in the 20th century and so since has been a low-carbon economy. However, since dramatic economic growth, Iceland's emissions have increased significantly per capita. As of 2009, Iceland energy is sourced from mostly [[geothermal energy]] and [[hydropower]], [[renewable energy in Iceland]] and, since 1999, has provided over 70% of the nation's [[primary energy]] and 99.9% of Iceland's [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statice.is/Uploads/files/LH06/L060701.xls |title=Gross energy consumption by source 1987–2005 |publisher=''[http://www.statice.is/?PageID=583 Statistics Iceland]'' |accessdate=2007-05-14 |format=XLS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125021947/http://www.statice.is/Uploads/files/LH06/L060701.xls |archivedate=2007-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, Iceland's carbon emissions per capita are 62% lower than those of the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Data.aspx |title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals Indicators |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2006-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite using more primary energy per capita,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eng.idnadarraduneyti.is/Publications/nr/1170 |title=Energy in Iceland |publisher=Icelandic Ministries of Industry and Commerce |accessdate=2007-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305070726/http://eng.idnadarraduneyti.is/Publications/nr/1170 |archive-date=2007-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the fact that it is renewable and low-cost. Iceland seeks [[carbon neutrality]] and expects to use 100% renewable energy by 2050 by generating [[hydrogen fuel]] from renewable energy sources.

====Peru====
The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) estimates that economic losses related to climate change for Peru could reach over 15% of national gross domestic product (GDP) by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economics of Climate Change in Peru|url=http://www.cepal.org/en/pressreleases/climate-change-peru-seen-affecting-fishing-high-andes-livestock-and-agricultural|website=Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a large country with a long coastline, snow-capped mountains and sizeable forests, Peru's varying ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Several mountain glaciers have already begun to retreat, leading to [[water scarcity]] in some areas. In the period between 1990 and 2015, Peru experienced a 99% increase in per capita carbon emissions from fossil fuel and cement production, marking one of the largest increases amongst South American countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forging low emission development paths in Latin America and the Caribbean: Multi-level dynamics in the world’s most urbanized region |url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GIP01771-CDKN_LEDS_LAC_Urbanization_final_updated_5-6-17_proof.pdf|website=LEDS GP|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peru brought in a National Strategy on Climate Change in 2003. It is a detailed accounting of 11 strategic focuses that prioritize scientific research, mitigation of climate change effects on the poor, and creating Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) mitigation and adaptation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSE Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/legislation/countries/peru/|website=London School of Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Peruvian Ministry of Environment published a Plan of Action for Adaptation and Mitigation of Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action Plan for Adaptation and Mitigation Against Climate Change (Peru)|url=http://theredddesk.org/countries/plans/action-plan-adaptation-and-mitigation-against-climate-change-peru|website=The REDD Desk|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Plan categorises existing and future programmes into seven action groups, including: reporting mechanisms on GHG emissions, mitigation, adaptation, research and development of technology of systems, financing and management, and public education. It also contains detailed budget information and analysis relating to climate change.

In 2014, Peru hosted the Twentieth Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP20) negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Framework Convention on Climate Change COP20|url=http://unfccc.int/meetings/lima_dec_2014/meeting/8141.php|website=UNFCCC COP20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Peru enacted a new climate law which provides for the creation of a national greenhouse gas inventory system called INFOCARBONO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEDS GP Peru's National Climate Law|url=http://ledsgp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CDKN_LEDS_PB_INFOCARBONO_FINAL_WEB.pdf|website=LEDS Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], INFOCARBONO is a major transformation of the country's greenhouse gas management system. Previously, the system was under the sole control of the Peruvian Ministry of the Environment. The new framework makes each relevant ministry responsible for their own share of greenhouse gas management.

====United Kingdom====
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Climate Change Act 2008]] outlining a framework for the transition to a low-carbon economy became law on November 26, 2008.  This legislation requires an 80% cut in the UK's [[carbon emissions]] by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels), with an intermediate target of between 26% and 32% by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070313a.htm|title=New Bill and strategy lay foundations for tackling climate change|publisher=[[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]|date=2007-03-13|accessdate=2007-03-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000610/http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070313a.htm |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the UK became the first country to set such a long-range and significant carbon reduction target into law.

A meeting at the [[Royal Society]] on 17–18 November 2008 concluded that an integrated approach, making best use of all available technologies, is required to move toward a low-carbon future. It was suggested by participants that it would be possible to move to a low-carbon economy within a few decades, but that 'urgent and sustained action is needed on several fronts'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/document.asp?tip=0&amp;id=8174 Towards a low carbon future], [[Royal Society]], 29 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the UK [[coalition government]] announced the introduction of mandatory carbon reporting, requiring around 1,100 of the UK’s largest listed companies to report their [[greenhouse gas emissions]] every year. [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]] confirmed that emission reporting rules would come into effect from April 2013 in his piece for The Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/19/rio-earth-summit-development-deadlines|title=Rio's reprise must set hard deadlines for development|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2012-06-19|accessdate=2012-07-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120730141206/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/19/rio-earth-summit-development-deadlines |archivedate = July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the UK Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) came into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1643/contents/made |title=The Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme Regulations 2014 |publisher=UK Government |accessdate=9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This requires all large businesses in the UK to undertake mandatory assessments looking at energy use and energy efficiency opportunities at least once every four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontrust.com/esos |title=ESOS: Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme |publisher=The Carbon Trust |accessdate=9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The low carbon economy has been described as a "UK success story", accounting for more than £120 billion in annual sales and employing almost 1 million people. A 2013 report suggests that over a third of the UK's economic growth in 2011/12 was likely to have come from green business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/technology/low-carbon-entrepreneurs |title=Low Carbon Entrepreneurs: the new engines of growth |date=May 2013 |publisher=The Carbon Trust |accessdate=25 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cities===
Companies are planning large scale developments without using fossil fuels. Development plans such as those by [[World Wide Assets LLC]] for entire cities using only [[geothermal energy]] for electricity, [[geothermal desalination]], and employing full recycling systems for water and waste are under development (2006) in Mexico and Australia.

'''''Mainstreams of Modern Art: David to Picasso''''' (1959) is a reference book by [[John Canaday]].  It comprehensively covers [[modern art]] from the start of [[Romanticism]] in the 18th century to [[Cubism]] and [[Abstract art]] in the early 20th century.  ''Mainstreams'' enjoyed wide commercial and critical success, and was awarded the 1959 [[Athenaeum Literary Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philaathenaeum.org/literary.html Literary Award Winners], The Athenæum of Philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt;

It also contains a ten-page appendix "Notes on Modern Architecture", the final five pages of which are devoted to criticism of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], whose design Canaday states "have failed disastrously."  But in the same sentence, he also praised Wright's buildings as "some of the most beautiful structures of the century bearing his name." This, combined with Canaday's other outspoken views, led a group of artists, collectors, and academics to write a letter to the ''[[New York Times]]'' in protest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.duke.edu/lilly/artlibry/dah/canadayj.htm John Canaday], Duke University Libraries&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38624">{{sociology}}
'''Mathematical sociology''' is the area of [[sociology]] that uses [[mathematics]] to construct social theories.  Mathematical sociology aims to take sociological theory, which is strong in intuitive content but weak from a formal point of view, and to express it in formal terms.  The benefits of this approach include increased clarity and the ability to use mathematics to derive implications of a theory that cannot be arrived at intuitively.  In mathematical sociology, the preferred style is encapsulated in the phrase "constructing a mathematical model."   This means making specified assumptions about some social phenomenon, expressing them in formal mathematics, and providing an empirical interpretation for the ideas.  It also means deducing properties of the model and comparing these with relevant empirical data.  [[Social network analysis]] is the best-known contribution of this subfield to sociology as a whole and to the scientific community at large. The models typically used in mathematical sociology allow sociologists to understand how predictable local interactions are and they are often able to elicit global patterns of social structure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soc.cornell.edu/research/mathematical_sociology.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Starting in the early 1940s, [[Nicolas Rashevsky]],&lt;ref&gt;* Nicolas Rashevsky.: 1947/1949 (2nd ed.). ''Mathematical Theory of Human Relations: An Approach to Mathematical Biology of Social Phenomena''. Bloomington, ID: Principia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* Nicolas Rashevsky. 1938/1948 (2nd ed.).'' Mathematical Biophysics:Physico-Mathematical Foundations of Biology''., University of Chicago Press : Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in the late 1940s, [[Anatol Rapoport]] and others, developed a [[relation algebra|relational]] and probabilistic approach to the characterization of large [[social network]]s in which the nodes are persons and the links are acquaintanceship. During the late 1940s, formulas were derived that connected local parameters such as closure of contacts – if A is linked to both B and C, then there is a greater than chance probability that B and C are linked to each other – to the global network property of connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, Anatol. (1957).  "Contributions to the Theory of Random and Biased Nets." ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics'' 19: 257-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, acquaintanceship is a ''positive tie'', but what about ''negative ties'' such as animosity among persons?  To tackle this problem, [[graph theory]], which is the mathematical study of abstract representations of networks of points and lines, can be extended to include these two types of links and thereby to create models that represent both positive and negative sentiment relations, which are represented as [[signed graph]]s.  A signed graph is called ''balanced'' if the product of the signs of all relations in every cycle (links in every graph cycle) is positive.  Through formalization by mathematician [[Frank Harary]] this work produced the fundamental theorem of this theory.  It says that if a network of interrelated positive and negative ties is balanced, e.g. as illustrated by the psychological principle that "my friend's enemy is my enemy", then it consists of two subnetworks such that each has positive ties among its nodes and there are only negative ties between nodes in distinct subnetworks.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, Dorwin &amp; Harary, Frank. (1956).  "[[Structural Balance]]: A Generalization of Heider's Theory."  ''Psychological Review'' 63:277-293.&lt;/ref&gt;  The imagery here is of a social system that splits into two cliques. There is, however, a special case where one of the two subnetworks is empty, which might occur in very small networks.
In another model, ties have relative strengths. 'Acquaintanceship' can be viewed as a 'weak' tie and 'friendship' is represented as a strong tie.  Like its uniform cousin discussed above, there is a concept of closure, called strong triadic closure.  A graph satisfies strong triadic closure If A is strongly connected to B, and B is strongly connected to C, then A and C must have a tie (either weak or strong).

n these two developments we have mathematical models bearing upon the analysis of structure.  Other early influential developments in mathematical sociology pertained to process.  For instance, in 1952 [[Herbert A. Simon]] produced a mathematical formalization of a published theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homans |first1=George C |title=The Human Group |date=1950 |publisher=Harcourt, Brace and World |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[social groups]] by constructing a model consisting of a deterministic system of differential equations.  A formal study of the system led to theorems about the dynamics and the implied [[equilibrium state]]s of any group.

The emergence of mathematical models in the social sciences was part of the zeitgeist in the 1940s and 1950s in which a variety of new interdisciplinary scientific innovations occurred, such as [[information theory]], [[game theory]], [[cybernetics]] and mathematical model building in the social and behavioral sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lazarsfeld |first1=Paul F |last2=Henry |first2=Neil W |title=Editors. Readings in Mathematical Social Science |date=1966 |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further developments==

In 1954, a critical expository analysis of Rashevsky's social behavior models was written by sociologist James S. Coleman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coleman |first1=James S |title=An expository analysis of some of Rashevsky's social behavior models |journal=Mathematical Thinking in the Social Sciences edited by Paul F. Lazarsfeld |date=1954 |issue=New York: The Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashevsky's models and as well as the model constructed by Simon raise a question: how can one connect such theoretical models to the data of sociology, which often take the form of surveys in which the results are expressed in the form of proportions of people believing or doing something.  This suggests deriving the equations from assumptions about the chances of an individual changing state in a small interval of time, a procedure well known in the mathematics of [[stochastic processes]].

Coleman embodied this idea in his 1964 book ''Introduction to Mathematical Sociology'', which showed how stochastic processes in social networks could be analyzed in such a way as to enable testing of the constructed model by comparison with the relevant data. The same idea can and has been applied to processes of change in social relations, an active research theme in the study of social networks, illustrated by an empirical study appearing in the journal Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kossinets |first1=Gueorgi |last2=Watts |first2=Duncan J |title=An empirical analysis of an evolving social network |journal=Science |date=2006 |volume=311 |issue=5757 |pages=88-90}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In other work, Coleman employed mathematical ideas drawn from economics, such as [[general equilibrium theory]], to argue that general social theory should begin with a concept of [[purposive action]] and, for analytical reasons, approximate such action by the use of [[rational choice]] models (Coleman, 1990).  This argument is similar to viewpoints expressed by other sociologists in their efforts to use rational choice theory in sociological analysis although such efforts have met with substantive and philosophical criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coleman |first1=James S |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=Rational Choice Theory: Advocacy and Critique. Editors. |date=1992 |publisher=Sage |location=Newbury Park, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, structural analysis of the type indicated earlier received a further extension to social networks based on institutionalized social relations, notably those of kinship.  The linkage of mathematics and sociology here involved abstract algebra, in particular, [[group theory]].&lt;ref&gt;White, Harrison C. 1963. An Anatomy of Kinship. Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  This, in turn, led to a focus on a data-analytical version of homomorphic reduction of a complex social network (which along with many other techniques is presented in [[Stanley Wasserman|Wasserman]] and Faust 1994&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Wasserman|Wasserman, S.]], &amp; Faust, K.. Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications. New York and Cambridge, ENG: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In regard to Rapoport's random and biased net theory, his 1961 study of a large sociogram, co-authored with Horvath turned out to become a very influential paper. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rapoport |first1=Anatol |last2=Horvath |first2=N J |title=A study of a large sociogram |journal=Behavioral Science |date=1961 |volume=6 |pages=279-291}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was early evidence of this influence. In 1964, Thomas Fararo and a co-author analyzed another large friendship sociogram using a biased net model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |last2=Sunshine |first2=Morris |title=A Study of Biased Friendship Net |date=1964 |publisher=Youth Development Center and Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 1960s, Stanley Milgram described the small world problem and undertook a field experiment dealing with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Milgram |first1=Stanley |title=The small world problem |journal=Psychology Today |date=May 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Travers |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Milgram |first2=Stanley |title=An experimental study of the small world problem |journal=Sociometry |date=1969 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=425-443}}&lt;/ref&gt; A highly fertile idea was suggested and applied by Mark Granovetter in which he drew upon Rapoport's 1961 paper to suggest and apply a distinction between weak and strong ties. The key idea was that there was "strength" in weak ties. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Granovetter |first1=Mark |title=The Strength of Weak Ties |journal=American Journal of Sociology |date=1973 |volume=78 |pages=1360-1380}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some programs of research in sociology employ experimental methods to study social interaction processes.  [[Joseph Berger (sociologist)|Joseph Berger]] and his colleagues initiated such a program in which the central idea is the use of the theoretical concept "expectation state" to construct theoretical models to explain interpersonal processes, e.g., those linking external status in society to differential influence in local group decision-making. Much of this theoretical work is linked to mathematical model building, especially after the late 1970s adoption of a graph theoretic representation of social information processing, as Berger (2000) describes in looking back upon the development of his program of research. In 1962 he and his collaborators explained model building by reference to the goal of the model builder, which could be explication of a concept in a theory, representation of a single recurrent social process, or a broad theory based on a theoretical construct, such as, respectively, the concept of balance in psychological and social structures, the process of conformity in an experimental situation, and stimulus sampling theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Joseph |last2=Cohen |first2=Bernard P |last3=Snell |first3=J Laurie |last4=Zelditch Jr |first4=Morris |title=Types of Formalization |date=1962 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The generations of mathematical sociologists that followed Rapoport, Simon, Harary, Coleman, White and Berger, including those entering the field in the 1960s such as Thomas Fararo, Philip Bonacich, and Tom Mayer, among others, drew upon their work in a variety of ways.

==Present research==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Mathematical sociology remains a small subfield within the discipline, but it has succeeded in spawning a number of other subfields which share its goals of formally modeling social life.  The foremost of these fields is [[social network analysis]], which has become among the fastest growing areas of sociology in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=John |title=Social Network Analysis. 4th Edition. |date=2017 |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other major development in the field is the rise of [[computational sociology]], which expands the mathematical toolkit with the use of [[computer simulation]]s, [[artificial intelligence]] and advanced statistical methods.  The latter subfield also makes use of the vast new data sets on social activity generated by social interaction on the internet.

One important indicator of the significance of mathematical sociology is that the general interest journals in the field, including such central journals as ''The American Journal of Sociology'' and ''The American Sociological Review'', have published mathematical models that became influential in the field at large.  

More recent trends in mathematical sociology are evident in contributions to ''The Journal of Mathematical Sociology'' (JMS).  Several trends stand out: the further development of formal theories that explain experimental data dealing with small group processes, the continuing interest in structural balance as a major mathematical and theoretical idea, the interpenetration of mathematical models oriented to theory and innovative quantitative techniques relating to methodology, the use of computer simulations to study problems in social complexity, interest in [[micro–macro linkage]] and the problem of emergence, and ever-increasing research on networks of social relations.  
 
Thus, topics from the earliest days, like balance and network models, continue to be of contemporary interest. The formal techniques employed remain many of the standard and well-known methods of mathematics: differential equations, stochastic processes and game theory. Newer tools like agent-based models used in computer simulation studies are prominently represented. Perennial substantive problems still drive research: [[social diffusion]], [[social influence]], [[social status]] origins and consequences, segregation, cooperation, [[collective action]], power, and much more.
 
== Research programs== 
Many of the developments in mathematical sociology, including [[Formal theory (political science)|formal theory]], have exhibited notable decades-long advances that began with path-setting contributions by leading mathematical sociologists and formal theorists.  This provides another way of taking note of recent contributions but with an emphasis on continuity with early work through the use of the idea of “[[research program]],” which is a coherent series of theoretical and empirical studies based on some fundamental principle or approach.  There are more than a few of these programs and what follows is no more than a brief capsule description of leading exemplars of this idea in which there is an emphasis on the originating leadership in each program and its further development over decades.

(1) [[Rational Choice Theory]] and James S. Coleman: After his 1964 pioneering ''Introduction to Mathematical Sociology'', Coleman continued to make contributions to social theory and mathematical model building and his 1990 volume, ''Foundations of Social Theory'' was the major theoretical work of a career that spanned the period from 1950s to 1990s and included many other research-based contributions..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Jon  Editor |title=James S Coleman |date=1996 |publisher=Routledge. Taylor and Francis Group |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Foundation book combined accessible examples of how rational choice theory could function in the analysis of such sociological topics as authority, [[trust (emotion)|trust]], [[social capital]] and the [[Social norm|norm]]s (in particular, their emergence).  In this way, the book showed how rational choice theory could provide an effective basis for making the transition from micro to macro levels of sociological explanation.  An important feature of the book is its use of mathematical ideas in generalizing the rational choice model to include [[interpersonal sentiment relations]] as modifiers of outcomes and doing so such that the generalized theory captures the original more self-oriented theory as a special case, as point emphasized in a later analysis of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |title=Social Action Systems |date=2001 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT |pages=255-278 (Ch. 11)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationality presupposition of the theory led to debates among sociological theorists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coleman |first1=James S. |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J. |title=Editors.  Rational Choice Theory: Advocacy and Critique |date=1992 |publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Nevertheless, many sociologists drew upon Coleman’s formulation of a general template for micro-macro transition to gain leverage on the continuation of topics central to his and the discipline's explanatory focus on a variety of macrosocial phenomena in which rational choice simplified the micro level in the interest of combining individual actions to account for macro outcomes of social processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raub |first1=Werner |last2=Buskens |first2=Vincent |last3=Van Assen |first3=Marcel |title=Micro-macro links and microfoundations in sociology |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |date=2011 |volume=35 |pages=1-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
(2) [[Structuralism (Formal)]] and Harrison C. White: In the decades since his earliest contributions, Harrison White has led the field in putting social structural analysis on a mathematical and empirical basis, including the 1970 publication of ''Chains of Opportunity: System Models of Mobility in Organization''s which set out and applied to data a [[vacancy chain]] model for mobility in and across organizations.   His very influential other work includes the operational concepts of [[blockmodel]] and [[structural equivalence]] which start from a body of social relational data to produce analytical results using these procedures and concepts.   These ideas and methods were developed in collaboration with his former students [[François Lorraine]], [[Ronald Breiger]], and [[Scott Boorman]]. These three are among the more than 30 students who earned their doctorates under White in the period 1963-1986. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Azarian |first1=Reza |title=The General Sociology of Harrison White |date=2003 |publisher=Department of Sociology, Stockholm University |location=Stockholm, Sweden |isbn=91-7265-603-4 |pages=213-216 |ref=Azarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory and application of blockmodels has been set out in detail in a recent monograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Doreian |first1=Patrick |last2=Batagelj |first2=Vladimir |last3=Ferligoj |first3=Anuska |title=Generalized Blockmodeling |date=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, U.K. |isbn=0-521-84085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. White's later contributions include a structuralist approach to markets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Harrison C. |title=Markets from Networks: Socioeconomic Models of Production |date=2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1992, a general theoretical framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Harrison C. |title=Identity and Control: A Structural Theory of Social Action |date=1992 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;, later appearing in a revised edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Harrison C. |title=Identity and Control |date=2008 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
(3) [[Expectation states theory]] and Joseph Berger: Under Berger’s intellectual and organizational leadership, Expectation States Theory branched out into a large number of specific programs of research on specific problems, each treated in terms of the master concept of expectation states.  He and his colleague and frequent collaborator [[Morris Zelditch Jr]] not only produced work of their own but created a doctoral program at Stanford University that led to an enormous outpouring of research by notable former students, including [[Murray Webster]], [[David Wagner (sociologist)|David Wagner]], and [[Hamit Fisek]].  Collaboration with mathematician [[Robert Z. Norman]] led to the use of mathematical graph theory as a way of representing and analyzing social information processing in self-other(s) interactions.  Berger and Zelditch also advanced work in formal theorizing and mathematical model building as early as 1962 with a collaborative expository analysis of types of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Joseph |last2=Cohen |first2=Bernard P. |last3=Snell |first3=J. Laurie |last4=Zelditch Jr |first4=Morris |title=Types of Formalization |date=1962 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Berger and Zelditch stimulated advances in other theoretical research programs by providing outlets for the publication of new work, culminating in a 2002 edited volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Joseph |last2=Zelditch Jr |first2=Morris |title=New Directions in Contemporary Sociological Theory |date=2002 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location=Lanham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; that  includes a chapter that presents an authoritative overview of [[Expectation states theory]] as a program of cumulative research dealing with [[group processes]].
 
(4) Formalization in [[Theoretical Sociology]] and Thomas J. Fararo: Many of this sociologist’s contributions have been devoted to bringing mathematical thinking into greater contact with sociological theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J. |title=Editor. Mathematical Ideas and Sociological Theory: Current State and Prospects |date=1984 |publisher=Gordon and Breach |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He organized a symposium attended by sociological theorists in which formal theorists delivered papers that were subsequently published in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J. |title=Symposium on Formal Theory |journal=Sociological Theory |date=November 2000 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=475-523}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through collaborations with students and colleagues his own theoretical research program dealt with such topics as [[macrostructural theory]] and [[E-state structuralism]] (both with former student [[John Skvoretz]]), [[subjective images of stratification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |last2=Kosaka |first2=Kenji |title=Generating Images of Stratification: A Formal Theory |date=2003 |publisher=Springer |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with former student [[Kenji Kosaka]]), [[tripartite structural analysis]] (with colleague [[Patrick Doreian]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |last2=Doreian |first2=Patrick |title=Tripartite structural analysis |journal=Social Networks |date=1984 |volume=6 |pages=141-175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[computational sociology]] (with colleague [[Norman P. Hummon]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hummon |first1=Norman P |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=The emergence of computational sociology |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |date=1995 |volume=20 |issue=2-3 |pages=79-87}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hummon |first1=Norman P |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=Actors and networks as objects |journal=Social Networks |date=1995 |volume=17 |pages=1-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his books are extended treatments of his approach to theoretical sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas |title=Social Action Systems |date=2001 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |title=The Meaning of General Theoretical Sociology: Tradition and Formalization |date=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
(5) Social Network Analysis and [[Linton C. Freeman]]:  In the early 1960s Freeman directed a sophisticated empirical study of [[community power structure]].  In 1978 he established the journal ''Social Networks.''  It rapidly became a major outlet for original research papers that used mathematical techniques to analyze network data.  The journal also publishes conceptual and theoretical contributions, including his paper “[[Centrality]] in Social Networks: Conceptual Clarification.” The paper has been cited more than 13,000 times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Linton C Freeman |website=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In turn, the mathematical concept defined in that paper led to further elaborations of the ideas, to experimental tests, and to numerous applications in empirical studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freeman |first1=Linton C |last2=Roeder |first2=Douglas |last3=Mulholland |first3=Robert |title=Centrality in social networks II. Experimental results |journal=Social Networks |date=1979-1980 |volume=2 |pages=119-141}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the author of a study of the history and sociology of the field of social network analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=Linton C |title=The development of social network analysis: a study in the sociology of science |date=2004 |publisher=BookSurge |location=North Charleston, SC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
(6) [[Quantitative Methodology]] and [[Kenneth C. Land]]: Kenneth Land has been on the frontier of quantitative methodology in sociology as well as formal theoretical model building.  The influential yearly volume ''Sociological Methodology'' has been one of Land’s favorite outlets for the publication of papers that often lie in the intersection of quantitative methodology and mathematical sociology.  Two of his theoretical papers appeared early in this journal: “Mathematical Formalization of Durkheim's Theory of Division of Labor” (1970) and “Formal Theory” (1971).  His decades-long research program includes contributions relating to numerous special topics and methods, including [[social statistics]], [[social indicators]], stochastic processes, [[mathematical criminology]], [[demography]] and [[social forecasting]].  Thus Land brings to these fields the skills of a statistician, a mathematician and a sociologist, combined. 
 
(7) [[Affect Control Theory]] and [[David R. Heise]]:  In 1979, Heise published a groundbreaking formal and empirical study in the tradition of interpretive sociology, especially symbolic interactionism,''Understanding Events: Affect and the Construction of Social Action.'' It was the origination of a research program that has included his further theoretical and empirical studies and those of other sociologists, such as  [[Lynn Smith-Lovin]], [[Dawn Robinson]] and [[Neil MacKinnon]]. Definition of the situation and self-other definitions are two of the leading concepts in affect control theory. The formalism used by Heise and other contributors uses a validated form of measurement and a [[cybernetic]] control mechanism in which immediate feelings and compared with fundamental sentiments in such a way as to generate an effort to bring immediate feelings in a situation into correspondence with sentiments. In the simplest models, each person in an interactive pair, is represented in terms of one side of a role relationship in which fundamental sentiments associated with each role guide the process of immediate interaction.  A higher level of the control process can be activated in which the definition of the situation is transformed. This research program comprises several of the key chapters in a  2006 volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McClelland |first1=Kent |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas |title=Purpose, Meaning and Action: Control Systems Theories in Sociology |date=2006 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of contributions to control systems theory (in the sense of Powers 1975 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Powers |first1=William |title=Behavior: The Control of Perception |date=1975 |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago, IL.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in sociology.
 
(8) "Distributive Justice Theory" and [[Guillermina Jasso]]: Since 1980, Jasso has treated problems of distributive justice with an original theory that uses mathematical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jasso |first1=Guillermina |title=A new theory of distributive justice |journal=American Sociological Review |date=1980 |volume=45 |pages=3-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has elaborated upon and applied this theory to a wide range of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jasso |first1=Guillermina |title=Curriculum Vitae 2018 |url=http://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/personnel/vitae/jasso_cv.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her most general mathematical apparatus – with the theory of distributive justice as a special case -- deals with any subjective comparison between some actual state and some reference level for it, e.g., a comparison of an actual reward with an expected reward.  In her justice theory, she starts with a very simple premise, the justice evaluation function (the natural logarithm of the ratio of actual to just reward) and then derives numerous empirically testable implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jasso |first1=Gullermina |title=Seven secrets of doing theory |journal=New Directions in Contemporary Sociological Theory edited by J Berger and M Zelditch Jr |date=2002 |pages=317-342}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
(9) Collaborative research and John Skvoretz. A major feature of modern science is collaborative research in which the distinctive skills of the participants combine to produce original research.  Skvoretz, in addition to this other contributions, has been a frequent collaborator in a variety of theoretical research programs, often using mathematical expertise as well as skills in experimental design, statistical data analysis and simulation methods.  Some examples are: (1) Collaborative work on theoretical, statistical and mathematical problems in biased net theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |last3=Agneessens |first3=F |title=Advances in biased net theory:Definitions, derivations, and estimations |journal=Social Networks |date=2004 |volume=26 |pages=113-139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (2) Collaborative contributions to Expectation States Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=Status and participation in task groups: A dynamic network model |journal=American Journal of Sociology |date=1996 |volume=101 |pages=1366-1414}}&lt;/ref&gt; (3) Collaborative contributions to [[Elementary Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Willer |first2=Dave |title=Exclusion and power: a test of four theories of power in exchange networks |journal=American Sociological Review |date=1993 |volume=58 |pages=801-818}}&lt;/ref&gt; (4) Collaboration with [[Bruce Mayhew]] in a structuralist research program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Mayhew |first2=Bruce |title=The structure of stratified systems and the structure of mobility: a first approximation to a structural theory of vertical mobility |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |date=1988 |volume=13 |pages=193-242}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 1970s, Skvoretz has been one of the most prolific of contributors to the advance of mathematical sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |title=Looking backwards into the future: Mathematical sociology then and now |journal=Sociological Theory |date=2000 |volume=18 |pages=510-517}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The above discussion could be expanded to include many other programs and individuals including European sociologists such as [[Peter Abell]] and the late [[Raymond Boudon]].

==Awards in mathematical sociology==

The section's other categories of awards and their recipients are listed at [http://www.asanet.org/asa-communities/asa-sections/current-sections/mathematical-sociology/mathematical-sociology-section-award-recipients/ ASA Section on Mathematical Sociology]

==Texts and journals==
Mathematical sociology textbooks cover a variety of models, usually explaining the required mathematical background before discussing important work in the literature (Fararo 1973, Leik and Meeker 1975, Bonacich and Lu 2012). An earlier text by [[Otomar Bartos]] (1967) is still of relevance. Of wider scope and mathematical sophistication is the text by Rapoport (1983).  A very reader-friendly and imaginative introduction to explanatory thinking leading to models is Lave and March (1975, reprinted 1993). The ''Journal of Mathematical Sociology'' (started in 1971) has been open to papers covering a broad spectrum of topics employing a variety of types of mathematics, especially through frequent special issues. Other journals in sociology who publish papers with substantial use of mathematics are [https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10588 Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory], [https://www.cmu.edu/joss/index.html Journal of social structure], [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/JASSS.html Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation] 

Articles in ''Social Networks,'' a journal devoted to social structural analysis, very often employ mathematical models and related structural data analyses.  In addition – importantly indicating the penetration of mathematical model building into sociological research – the major comprehensive journals in sociology, especially ''The American Journal of Sociology'' and ''The American Sociological Review,'' regularly publish articles featuring mathematical formulations.

'''Michelle Mohabeer''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[filmmaker]] and [[Film writer|writer]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Her films have received many rewards including the Isabella Liddell Art Award,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;http://aafilmfest.org/images/pdfs/festival-programs/aaff_32_program.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the 5 Feminist Minutes Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Baker|first=Marie Annharte|title=Five Feminist Minutes|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280677/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_dr#directors|last2=Blain|last3=Boschman|last4=Browne|last5=Burns|last6=Cole|last7=Dempsey|last8=Fleming|last9=Gagnon|first2=Kim|first3=Lorna|first4=Christene|first5=Alison|first6=Janis|first7=Shawna|first8=Ann Marie|first9=Angèle|accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her first work, ''Exposure'' (1990) was produced through the [[National Film Board of Canada|National Film Board]]'s [[Studio D]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During and after creating several films, she has also served as an adjunct lecturer at the following post-secondary institutions: [[University of Toronto]], [[Trent University]], [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Ryerson University]] and [[Sheridan College]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vtape.org/artist?ai=701|title=Michelle Mohabeer|last=|first=|date=|website=Vtape|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelle's film work has been displayed at over 150 [[Film festival|festivals]], conferences and [[Art Gallery|galleries]] located across 18 countries from multiple continents. Her films have been collected by over sixty [[university]] [[Library|libraries]] across [[North America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Michelle Mohabeer was born in [[Guyana]], [[South America]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Romance of Transgression in Canada: Queering Sexualities,|last=Waugh|first=Thomas|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780773530690|location=Montreal, QU|pages=127, 155, 172, 472|via=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada in 1974 at the age of 13.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Film Fatales: Independent Women Directors|last=Redding|first=Judith M.|last2=Brownworth|first2=Victoria A.|publisher=Seal Press|year=1997|isbn=1-878067-97-4|location=Seattle, WA|pages=104–108|via=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, she successfully received her [[Bachelor's degree|BA]] in [[Film studies|Film Studies]] from [[Carleton University]]. Her second degree was earned in 1998, it was a [[Master of Fine Arts|Master's of Fine Arts]] in [[Film production|Film Production]] from [[York University]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 2005, at the University of Toronto she received a PhD in Culture and Communication with a focus on Film Studies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfmdc.org/user/8430|title=Michelle Mohabeer|last=|first=|date=|website=CFMDC - Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Michelle Mohabeer started her film-making career working for the National Film Board in Studio D,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; she created her first short film ''Exposure'' (1990) for the series ''Five Feminist Minutes''. This film was a huge success, not only for its content, but for the fact that this was "the first up-front [[lesbian]] film from the NFB" and the fact that the film was made by, in the words of Film Critic Thomas Waugh, "lesbian artist of colour in the Canadian canon."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Following the release of her film she had a brief employment with  [[CKLN-FM|CKLN]] [[radio]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Four years later she released her second film ''Coconut/Cane &amp; Cutlass'' (1994); due to the great success of her first film the budget for her second feature was almost nine times larger allowing her to shoot in Canada and Guyana. In 1996, she created two more films ''Two/Doh'' and ''Child-play'' (1997); ''Two/Doh'' was noted for being produced at very low cost, while ''Child-play'' was Mohabeer's first attempt at a drama film.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During the nineteen-nineties she was active on several arts community boards in Toronto, frequently serving as [[Arts administrator|administrator]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the new millennium, Michelle Mohabeer directed several more films, in 2001 she created the film ''Tracing Soul''; in 2003 she wrote and directed the film ''Echoes''. Finally, in 2008, she made the film ''Blu In You.'' &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bab3f1bec|title=Michelle Mohabeer|newspaper=BFI|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her career as a filmmaker Professor Mohabeer has also taught the next generation of filmmakers, she has appeared as a [[guest lecturer]] or hosted workshops at several post-secondary institutions. She has also taught entire classes, namely Film Studies at [[Innis College, Toronto|Innis College]], [[Cinema Studies]] at the University of Toronto, and York University and Film Production at Ryerson University.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Currently, Professor Mohabeer teaches in the [[Communication studies|Communication Studies]] and [[Humanities]] departments at [[York University]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yorku.academia.edu/MichelleMohabeer|title=Michelle Mohabeer {{!}} York University - Academia.edu|last=|first=|date=|website=yorku.academia.edu|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cinematic style and influence ==
Many critics have noted that Mohabeer's films frequently explore the themes of "the diversity of cultural identity and the [[politics]] of [[gender]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[colonialism]]."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Film Scholar Tara Atluri, has argued that Mohabeer's films also feature several links to the [[Indo-Caribbean]] film [[tradition]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atluri|first=Tara|year=2009|title=Putting the ‘Cool’ in Coolie: Disidentification, Desire and Dissent in the Work of Filmmaker Michelle Mohabeer.|url=http://www.uwispace.sta.uwi.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2139/15939/T.%20Atluri-%20Putting%20the%20Cool%20in%20Coolie.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|journal=Caribbean Review of Gender Studies|volume=|issue=3|pages=1–25|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Michoud Assembly Facility''' (MAF) is an 832-acre (337&amp;nbsp;ha) manufacturing complex owned by [[NASA]] in [[Eastern New Orleans|New Orleans East]], a district within [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], in the United States. Organizationally it is part of NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], and is currently a multi-tenant complex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacobstechnology.com |title=Jacobs Technology |publisher=Jacobs Technology |date= |accessdate=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow commercial and government contractors, as well as government agencies, to use the site.

MAF is one of the largest manufacturing plants in the world with 43 [[HVAC|environmentally controlled]] acres&amp;mdash;{{convert|174000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}&amp;mdash;under one roof, and it employs more than 4,200 people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/172203main_MAF_tenant_FS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; From September 1961 to the end of the Apollo program in December 1972 the site was utilized by [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]] to build the first stages of the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn I and Saturn IB]], later joined by [[Boeing|Boeing Corporation]] to build the first stage of the [[Saturn V]] rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fly Chrysler to the Moon: the Saturn Rockets | author = Curtis Redgap | url = http://www.allpar.com/history/military/moon.html  | publisher = Allpar.com | access-date = 2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; From September 5, 1973, to September 20, 2010, the factory was used for the construction of the [[Space Shuttle]]'s [[Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tanks]] by [[Martin Marietta|Martin Marietta Corporation, Denver Colorado.]]&lt;ref name="etend"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dean|first=James|title=Michoud Declares End Of External Tank Production | url=http://space.flatoday.net/2010/09/michoud-declares-end-of-external-tank.html|publisher=[[Florida Today]]|access-date=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Apmisc-MSFC-6870792.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|alt=A large horizontal rocket with USA painted on the side inside of a manufacturing facility|First stages of [[Saturn V]] rockets being assembled at the Michoud factory in the 1960s]]
The facility was originally constructed in 1940 at the village of [[Michoud, New Orleans|Michoud, Louisiana]], by the Higgins-Tucker division of [[Higgins Industries]] under the direction of [[Andrew Higgins|Andrew Jackson Higgins]]. Construction was done on behalf of the United States government for the war production during [[World War II]] of plywood [[Curtiss-Wright C-76 Caravan|C-76 cargo planes]] and [[landing craft]]. The project cost $180 million ($2.8 billion in 2018).&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/history-maf&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Korean War]] it made engines for [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]] and [[M46 Patton|Patton]] tanks, and boasted a 5,500 foot paved runway. It came under the management of NASA in 1961, and was used for the construction of the [[S-IC]] first stage of the [[Saturn V]] rockets and the [[S-IB]] first stage of the [[Saturn IB]] rockets built by Chrysler Corporation. It is home to the first stage of the last-constructed Saturn V, SA-515, built by Chrysler Corporation and Boeing Corporation. The facility's height limitation, which was unable to allow the construction of the bigger C-8 direct Moon vehicle, was one of the major reasons why the smaller C-5 (later renamed Saturn V) was chosen instead of the originally planned Moon vehicle.

The majority of the NASA factory's history was focused on construction and production of NASA's [[Space Shuttle external tank]] (ET). Beginning with rollout of ET-1 on June 29, 1979, which flew on [[STS-1]], 136 tanks were produced throughout the Space Shuttle program, ending with the flight-ready tank ET-122, which flew on [[STS-134]], rolled out on September 20, 2010.&lt;ref name="ET-122"&gt;{{cite web|last= Sloss|first=Philip|title=MAF speak of their pride in returning ET-122 to the Shuttle manifest|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/09/maf-pride-returning-et-122-shuttle-manifest/|website=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]]|date=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A single tank produced at the facility, ET-94, was not used in spaceflight and remained at Michoud as a [[test article]].&lt;ref name="etend" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tank ET-122 ended up being the last, even though its sequence number was lower than the total number of tanks produced, because it had been damaged during Hurricane Katrina and required repairs prior to completion.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hurricane Katrina ===
[[File:NASA Michoud Katrina Flooding.jpg|thumb|left|A section of eastern New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. MAF (green) is not flooded, while the surrounding neighborhoods (dark greenish brown) are extensively flooded.]]
The facility did not experience significant flooding during [[Hurricane Katrina]] due to a natural [[ridge]] that runs along its northwestern boundary, the [[levee]] that makes up the southern and eastern boundaries, and the work of the pump operators who stayed to protect the facility during the storm. There was wind damage and rainwater damage to several buildings. All shifts were initially canceled up to September 26, 2005, potentially setting back future Shuttle flights. All the buildings and the shuttle hardware within survived the hurricane without grave damage, but the roof of the main manufacturing building was breached and debris damaged ET-122 stored inside; that tank was refurbished and later flew on the final flight of [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']], [[STS-134]]. Thirty-eight NASA and Lockheed Martin employees stayed behind during Hurricane Katrina to operate the pumping systems, knowing that if not activated and sustained, the facility would have been destroyed. The workers pumped more than one billion gallons (3,800,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of water out of the facility and probably were the reason that the rocket factory suffered very little damage. These employees were each awarded the [[NASA Exceptional Bravery Medal]], NASA's highest bravery award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | title = NASA Administrator Honors Katrina Heroes | date = 2006-01-05 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/maf_rideout.html | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2005 [[NASA]] announced that the repairs were progressing faster than anticipated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | date = 2005-09-16 | publisher = NASA | title = NASA Planning to Resume Work at Michoud Assembly Facility | url = http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/sep/HQ_05268_Resume_Work_Michoud.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so they would continue to use Michoud for external tank work. On October 3, 2005, the facility officially reopened for essential personnel, though some key personnel had returned earlier. On October 31 the facility reopened to all personnel.

On February 7, 2017, an [[2017 New Orleans tornado|EF3]] tornado carved a path through [[New Orleans|Orleans Parish]], in which the factory is located. Two major buildings including the main manufacturing building were damaged, with multiple broken windows. 5 people were injured, and resulting repairs and other factors contributed to the delay of the first SLS launch until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/michoud/workers-repair-roof-damage-to-nasa-s-rocket-factory |title=Workers Repair Roof Damage to NASA’s Rocket Factory &amp;#124; NASA |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2017-02-07 |accessdate=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Billow |url=http://www.wesh.com/article/nasa-rocket-factory-damaged-by-violent-winds/8694938 |title=NASA rocket factory damaged by violent winds |publisher=Wesh.com |date=2017-02-08 |accessdate=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buildings ==
[[File:SLS Liquid Oxygen Tank Hardware in Welding.jpg|thumb|right|Welding of the SLS liquid oxygen tank in the South Vertical Assembly Building]]
The facility consists of four large buildings in one complex:

*   Building 1 comprises the main manufacturing building (Building number 103), and the North and South Vertical Assembly Buildings (Building numbers 115 and 110 respectively). The North VAB was constructed in 2011, initially to add new vertical welding equipment. The main manufacturing building is where the majority of preliminary fabrication and welding activities take place - the Space Launch System core stage (and previously the [[Space Shuttle External Tank]] and [[S-IC|Saturn V first stage]]) were manufactured. The building stretches 512 meters by 340 meters in dimensions, and contains over 40 sub-areas for different manufacturing and structural assembly operations. A series of internal roads made from polished concrete provide ease of access by factory vehicles, trams, and overhead cranes to move components around. They run the whole length of the factory building. Factory floor office buildings and engineering rooms are located in various ends of the main manufacturing building. Near the South VAB is an electric arc furnace and casting equipment. In front of the main manufacturing building is the administration offices, lobby, restaurants and engineering conference rooms. There is also a gym, retail stores, media lab, a medical area and a large cafeteria provided for the workers.&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/node/268&lt;/ref&gt; Facing north is a factory floor museum display area, with mission patches, flags and memorials.&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/amenities&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/node/286&lt;/ref&gt;
*   Building 2 is an external building that is used to manufacture smaller components and space station equipment, for example small components for the [[International Space Station]]. It also supplies various small components such as fasteners to the main building.&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/file/533&lt;/ref&gt;
*   Building 3 is another external building for various manufacturing processes, and contains a laboratory, office space and technical storage areas.&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/file/535&lt;/ref&gt; Building 3-20 is the employees dormitory building, and contains a restaurant and offices.
*   Building 4 is located south of the complex. It is an industrial workshop for the processing and application of spray-on insulation foam to SLS tank components. Space Shuttle external tank spares were also housed there.&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/file/529&lt;/ref&gt;
*   Adjacent to the main manufacturing building are more foam application workshops, power transformers for the arc furnace and other facilities, and large amounts of open space. In front of the South VAB, rocket parts are moved from this building to the side internal workshops across the plaza for inspection and checks. The SLS core stage test simulator (made of steel) is also located in this area.
*   The National Finance Center (NSF) - located west of the complex; houses offices for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and contains several large conference rooms, a restaurant and a ballroom for NASA employees and visitor events.

The shipping port is located 600 meters southwest of the main manufacturing building. Transporting vehicles carrying manufactured SLS components move down Saturn Blvd, past large open fields, to the pier - where the Pegasus Barge is docked. This is where the components are shipped to their final destination - [[Kennedy Space Center]], or rarely back to the main [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in Huntsville, Alabama.

== Other and future activities ==
The Michoud Assembly Facility also houses other organizations such as the [[National Finance Center]] operated by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], the [[United States Coast Guard]], Blade Dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bladedynamics.com Blade Dynamics]&lt;/ref&gt; the Chris A. Hadfield Rocket Factory,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/chris-hadfield&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lockheed Martin]] and NASA. The factory is now the location for the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS) being built by the Boeing company which will be the most powerful rocket in the history of spaceflight. It will carry the Orion spacecraft during its first launch to prove capabilities. Launch is set for early 2019.

The factory complex is open to public visitation, visitors need to sign in at the main reception and clear security.&lt;ref&gt;https://mafspace.msfc.nasa.gov/visitors-maf&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA planned to use the rocket factory to build the structure for several components of the cancelled [[Constellation program]], including the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion spacecraft]], the [[Ares I]] [[Ares I#Design|Upper Stage]], and the [[Ares V]] Core Stage. Under the Obama administration, the Constellation Program was cancelled in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/9305-president-obama-signs-vision-space-exploration-law.html "President Obama Signs New Vision for U.S. Space Exploration Into Law"]. Space.com, October 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but was replaced with SLS a year later to continue space exploration efforts.

NASA has an agreement in place to rent out a portion of the facility to Big Easy Studios, a New Orleans film studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwltv.com/news/local/Michoud-Facility-in-NO-East-becoming-hub-for-major-film-productions-138522804.html WWLTV News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221181134/http://www.wwltv.com/news/local/Michoud-Facility-in-NO-East-becoming-hub-for-major-film-productions-138522804.html |date=2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This deal as been criticized by competing studios as violating NASA's rule that any deal with an outside entity must serve the agency's mission and must not compete with the private sector.  NASA officials defend the agreement, stating that this helps to offset the cost of unused space on the facility and that their pricing is vetted by state and local economic development agencies to ensure it is not competing with the private market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.businessreport.com/article/20120917/BUSINESSREPORT0112/120919831/ | title = NASA defends deal with N.O. film studio | author = David Jacobs | date = 2012-09-17 | publisher = Greater Baton Rouge Business Report | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140515011909/http://www.businessreport.com/article/20120917/BUSINESSREPORT0112/120919831/ | archivedate = 2014-05-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of ''[[Ender's Game (film)|Ender's Game]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Ender’s Game filmed at NASA Michoud Assembly Facility | author = Jim Cheng | url = http://www.emersiondesign.com/news/enders-game-filmed-at-nasa-michoud-assembly-facility-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[G.I.

==Incidents ==

[[TACA Flight 110]] operated with a [[Boeing 737-300]] jetliner made a successful emergency landing on a grassy [[levee]] in the Michoud grounds after power was lost in both engines during a severe thunderstorm. The aircraft was towed into the Michoud facility, where its engines were replaced. On 6 June, it took off, with a crew of two and minimal fuel, using the former runway at Michoud,&lt;ref name="UPI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Emergency-shortened flight is completed |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/06/06/Emergency-shortened-flight-is-completed/6569581572800/ |publisher=UPI |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=en |date=June 6, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been reused as a road, Saturn Boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Coord|30.0164|-89.9204|region:US|name=Saturn Boulevard}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was flown the short distance to New Orleans International Airport, where it was repaired.&lt;ref name="UPI" /&gt;
Over the years, several reported incidents of robbery and terrorism occurred at the facility; where trespassers on numerous occasions have been known to break in and have stolen technical paperwork. As a result, public visitors and employees taking photographs inside is highly regulated by NASA officials. There was a recent bomb threat to MAF; and after 9/11, double-perimeter security fences were installed in 2007-2008. At the same time, all of the front windows of the administration offices were upgraded with black-anodized shatter-proof transparent panels.

'''Minnie Cumnock Blodgett''' (1862&amp;ndash;1931) graduated from [[Vassar College]] in 1884, later becoming a trustee (1917&amp;ndash;1931). She is the mother of Katharine Blodgett Hadley (VC '20), who was also a Vassar trustee (1942&amp;ndash;1954), and was chairman of the Board (1945&amp;ndash;1952).&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1928/1928-blodgett.html |title= The Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics was completed, York &amp; Sawyer, architects. -  - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu/ |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband, [[John W. Blodgett]], built their estate, which they named [[John W. Blodgett Estate|Brookby]], where they made their Grand Rapids home.

==Vassar College and Euthenics program==
After [[Ellen Swallow Richards]]' death in 1911, [[Julia Lathrop]] (1858&amp;ndash;1932), another of Vassar's most distinguished alumnae, continued to promote the development of an interdisciplinary program in [[euthenics]] at the college.  Lathrop soon teamed with alumna Minnie Cumnock Blodgett, who with her husband, John Wood Blodgett, offered financial support to create a program of euthenics at [[Vassar College]].  Curriculum planning, suggested by Vassar President [[Henry Noble MacCracken]] in 1922, began in earnest by 1923.&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |title=The Disappointing First Thrust of Euthenics |author=Vassar Historian |date= |website=vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127020842/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |archivedate=27 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, through a gift of $550,000.00 from Mrs. Blodgett, the Institute of Euthenics was founded at Vassar.  Its aim was "to supply scientific knowledge of the complex problems of adjustment between individuals and the environment, emphasizing home and family."&lt;ref name="NYTimesObituary"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20D1EFC395F177A93C6A8178BD95F458385F9 |title= SOCIAL WORKER DIES AT 68 ON VISIT HERE - Mrs. John W. Blodgett of Grand Rapids Had Been Guest of Her Daughter and Son-in-Law. ONCE TRUSTEE OF VASSAR Director of Child Study Association and of National Organization for Public Health Nursing. |author= |year= 1931 |website= nytimes.com |publisher= NY Times |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vassar historian Colton Johnson noted "The Blodgetts' gift was the largest gift given to the College after Matthew Vassar donated $408,000 in 1861 to get the College started ... Their intention was to bring into the curriculum of the College a course of study specifically designed around the ideas of Ellen Swallow Richards."

==Death==
Mrs. John Wood Blodgett died suddenly of heart disease on October 13, 1931 in her suite in [[The St. Regis Hotel]], New York, NY.  She was there to attend meetings for two health organizations and spend some time visiting her daughter and son-in-law.  According to her obituary in the ''New York Times'', she was a director of  the Child Study Association, the National Organization for Public Health Nursing, and was a member of the National Committee on Mental Hygiene. She was the daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. Alexander G. Cunnock [sic] of Lowell, Mass. She was also president of the D.A. Blodgett Home for Children, and sat on the board of trustees at Vassar College.&lt;ref name="NYTimesObituary" /&gt;

NatCen is best known for its annual [[British Social Attitudes Survey]], founded by the organisation in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/series/?sn=200006|title=Discover - British Social Attitudes Survey|website=discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40408576 |title=British Attitudes Survey: More Britons 'back higher taxes' - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Social Attitudes survey is Britain's longest-running annual survey of public attitudes. It uses a random probability method and face to face interviews with more than 3,000 people to ensure that it achieves a sample that is representative of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/media/604586/natcenintrobsa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; NatCen's sister organisation, the [[ScotCen Social Research|Scottish Centre for Social Research]] (ScotCen), carries out an equivalent of the survey in Scotland, called the Scottish Social Attitudes survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/series/?sn=2000049 |title=UK Data Service Discover » Scottish Social Attitudes Survey |publisher=Discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-39265997 |title=Scottish independence support 'at highest ever level' - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2017-03-15 |accessdate=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Civics Bureau''' ({{lang-ms|Biro Tata Negara}}), abbreviated '''BTN''', was an [[Government agency|agency]] of the Malaysian previous ruling [[government of Malaysia|government]] under [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition in the [[Prime Minister's Department]]. It was established in 1974 as the Youth Research Unit (Unit Penyelidikan Belia) under the Youth Ministry, but was renamed and transferred in 1981. BTN's stated objective is to nurture the spirit of patriotism and commitment to excellence among Malaysians, and train leaders and future leaders to support the nation's development efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Latar Belakang |url=http://www.btn.gov.my/v2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=351&amp;Itemid=41 |accessdate=21 November 2009 |publisher=Biro Tata Negara |language=Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt; BTN's programmes are controversial, and many accuse them of explicitly promoting ''[[ketuanan Melayu]]'' and the former governing coalition [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lim Kit Siang |title=Any Najib apology for the rank racism of BTN indoctrination courses? |url=http://blog.limkitsiang.com/2008/09/04/any-najib-apology-for-the-rank-racism-of-btn-indoctrination-courses/ |work=The New Straits Times |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anwar trains his sights on 1 Malaysia |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/25013-anwar-trains-his-sights-on-1-malaysia |work=The Malaysian Insider |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Azly Rahman |title=Create radical social futurists, dismantle Biro Tata Negara -- that threat to national unity |url=http://malaysia-today.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28726:create-radical-social-futurists-dismantle-biro-tata-negara-that-threat-to-national-unity&amp;catid=1:a-republic-of-virtue&amp;Itemid=100088 |work=Malaysia Today |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 November 2009, the [[Selangor]] state government issued a ban prohibiting state civil servants, employees of state subsidiaries, and students at state-owned institutions from attending BTN courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tan Yi Liang |title=Selangor boycotts Biro Tata Negara programmes |url=http://www.thesundaily.com/article.cfm?id=40637 |work=The Sun Daily |date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mazlinda Mahmood |title=No Biro Tatanegara courses for Selangor govt employees |url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/articles/8ku/Article/index_html |work=The New Straits Times |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127134134/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/articles/8ku/Article/index_html |archivedate=27 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2009, the [[Penang]] state government followed suit and banned all state civil servants from attending the controversial courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Penang bans civil servants from attending BTN courses |url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/32309 |work=Sin Chew |date=2 December 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 13 August 2018, Youth and Sports Minister [[Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman]] from the new federal government under [[Pakatan Harapan]] (PH) announced that the BTN and [[National Service Training Programme (Malaysia)|National Service Training Programme]] (PLKN) were abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/08/13/syed-saddiq-btn-and-national-service-are-abolished/ Syed Saddiq: BTN and National Service are abolished]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.malaymail.com/s/1661883/syed-saddiq-btn-national-service-abolished Syed Saddiq: BTN, National Service abolished]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of racism==
Although BTN has been the subject of various allegations over the years, in late 2009, it became the subject of greater controversy, when many allegations of racism and political propaganda appeared in quick succession. One BTN alumnus claimed that he was "taught a song with lyrics like 'the land that you walk upon is owned by others'. Lecturers told us the [[Malay people|Malays]] were forced to depend on the [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]] for support after 1998 because some Malays had betrayed their own race," in reference to Malays voting against the [[Barisan Nasional]] in [[Malaysian general election, 1999|1999 general election]]. [[Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad]], another alumnus and assemblyman for Seri Setia in the [[Selangor State Assembly|State Legislative Assembly of Selangor]], claimed that the BTN camp he attended was "racial and political in nature," with trainers telling attendees that Malays require [[affirmative action]] and criticising the opposition [[Parti Islam SeMalaysia]] (PAS) as "deviationist". Amirudin Shari, assemblyman for [[Batu Caves]], claimed that "participants are indoctrinated with propaganda about '[[Ketuanan Melayu]]' and external threats".&lt;ref name="patriotism camps"&gt;{{cite news |title=KL patriotism camps ‘racist and political’ |url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44127-kl-patriotism-camps-racist-and-political |work=The Malaysian Insider |date=21 November 2009 |accessdate=21 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another alumnus claims he was taught that the Chinese were "the Jews of Asia," and part of a [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to topple the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Asrul Hadi | last=Abdullah Sani | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=‘BTN taught me the Chinese are the Jews of Asia’ | date=27 November 2009 | publisher=The Malaysian Insider | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44775-btn-taught-me-the-chinese-are-the-jews-of-asia | work = | pages = | accessdate = 27 November 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another alumnus alleged she was "told that the Malays were the most supreme race in the world, we were God's chosen few, that the others were insignificant. We were warned about certain elements in our society and abroad, determined to undermine Malay excellence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mariam | last=Mokhtar | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=BTN: Divisive, racist, {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated | date=5 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/119070 | work =Malaysiakini | pages = | accessdate = 7 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2009, Nik Nazmi, Amirudin and five other [[Pakatan Rakyat]] state assemblymen asked the Selangor government to stop requiring students at its universities and colleges to attend BTN courses. After the Selangor government issued a ban prohibiting state employees and students at state institutions from attending BTN programmes, the State Executive Councillor for Education, Dr. Halimah Ali, described the courses as "indoctrination by the Barisan Nasional government" and said, "the courses promote racism and my own children who have attended BTN have been given booklets that encourage hate towards the opposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Neville |last=Spykerman |title=Selangor moves to stop BTN ‘brainwashing’ | date=26 November 2009 |url=http://themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44582-selangor-moves-to-stop-btn-brainwashing |work=The Malaysian Insider |accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, BTN deputy director Hamim Husin was reported for referring Chinese as ''Si mata pepet'' (the slant-eyed) and Indians as ''Si botol'' (the drinkers) during a closed-door function of Puteri UMNO (Women youth wing of [[United Malays National Organisation]]) delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Su Lyn|first1=Boo|title=Malays must rule the country, says BTN rep|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/malays-must-rule-the-country-says-btn-rep#sthash.hm9a6NCx.dpbs|accessdate=21 June 2015|publisher=The Malaysian Insider|date=27 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526175152/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/malays-must-rule-the-country-says-btn-rep|archivedate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kashuerin|first1=Suresh|title=Kit Siang: Racist BTN should be dissolved|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/06/19/kit-siang-racist-btn-should-be-dissolved/|accessdate=21 June 2015|publisher=Free Malaysia Today|date=19 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621211148/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/06/19/kit-siang-racist-btn-should-be-dissolved/|archivedate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, Minister in Prime Minister's department [[Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz|Nazri Aziz]] reported that the deputy director has been suspended from duty since October 2010 and a warning letter has been issued. However, the duration of suspension was not disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Si sepet, si kaki botol, pegawai rasis digantung (Si sepet, Si kaki botol, racist employee is suspended)|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/147567|accessdate=21 June 2015|publisher=Malaysiakini|date=8 November 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530150545/http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/147567|archivedate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response by the Malaysian government==
''The Malaysian Insider'' reported in November 2009 that in response to brewing controversy, the [[Cabinet of Malaysia|Cabinet]] had discussed the need to revamp BTN. Minister in the Prime Minister's Department [[Idris Jala]] arranged a briefing for the Cabinet on the effects of BTN programmes, and the meeting concluded with the Prime Minister reportedly saying, "This must end." In an editorial, the publication said: "''The Malaysian Insider'' understands that there are moves within the administration to dilute the syllabus of BTN courses, as a compromise. But such half-measures are not likely to be enough if Najib is serious about reversing what many Malaysians see as institutionalised racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Leslie | last=Lau | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Najib’s BTN dilemma | date=28 November 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44845-pkr-najib-faces-btn-dilemma | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 29 November 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Malay titles|Tan Sri]] [[Muhyiddin Yassin]] defended BTN, saying its programmes inculcate nationalism and unity among Malaysians in line with the Prime Minister's [[1Malaysia]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DPM defends BTN courses against racist brainwashing charges  |url=http://themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44692-muhyiddin-btn-courses-not-political-indoctrination |work=The Malaysian Insider |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BTN Courses Not Political Indoctrination - Muhyiddin  |url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=458094 |work=BERNAMA |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department [[Malay titles|Datuk]] [[Ahmad Maslan]] said "knowledge and information ... presented at these courses are based on historical facts and data ... collected from various agencies and ... experts" and are consistent with 1Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Teaching based on historical facts and data'  |url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=458094 |work=The New Straits Times |date=27 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad, who is also head of the BTN, denied allegations that it was systemically racist: "Out of the 1,000 lectures given, maybe only one minute the lecturer had a slip-up so it is unfair that you portray BTN as racist just for that." Describing typical course contents, he said participants "are taught about the Federal Constitution, the social contract, the position of the Malays in this country and 60 per cent of the population are the bumiputras." Although Minister in the Prime Minister's Department [[Nazri Aziz]] previously told the press that the Cabinet had ordered a revamp of BTN courses to eliminate elements inconsistent with 1Malaysia, Ahmad denied this, saying that Cabinet merely wanted an "upgrade" as opposed to a "revamp".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Syed Jaymal | last=Zahiid | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=More flip-flop as BTN chief speaks out | date=1 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45128-more-flip-flop-as-btn-chief-speaks-out- | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 1 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding, Nazri insisted that "Whatever word you use, upgrade or revamp ... to me, it is a change of module. Datuk Ahmad Masalan is a member of the Cabinet, he can’t dispute my statement." Nazri also criticised the denial of allegations against BTN, saying that opposition members who had previously been in government like Leader of the Opposition [[Anwar Ibrahim]] "know, so what is there to deny?" and said that BTN had been used to promote certain political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Syed Jaymal | last=Zahiid | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Nazri says no point denying what BTN is | date=1 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45161-nazri-says-no-point-denying-what-btn-is- | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 1 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mahathir's involvement in BTN==
Former Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] defended BTN as meant to inculcate the values of discipline and hard work in public servants and scholars: "What we tried to teach them is that they should have new values, new culture...because the culture and the value-system they have is not conducive to success. If they want to serve the government well, they must accept and practice a certain value system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Shazwan | last=Mustafa Kamal | coauthors= | authorlink= | title=Dr M says criticisms against BTN an ‘exaggeration’ | date=7 December 2009 | publisher= | url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45729-dr-m-says-criticisms-against-btn-an-exaggeration- | work=The Malaysian Insider | pages= | accessdate=7 December 2009 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212223735/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45729-dr-m-says-criticisms-against-btn-an-exaggeration- | archivedate=12 December 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling party-owned ''[[Utusan Malaysia]]'' newspaper criticised the decision to change the BTN curriculum, claiming Nazri was acting on his own and urging the government not to "bow down" to the opposition.&lt;ref name='nazri dr m'&gt;{{cite news | first=Asrul Hadi | last=Abdullah Sani | coauthors= | authorlink= | title=Nazri calls Dr M a racist for defending BTN | date=7 December 2009 | publisher= | url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45724-nazri-calls-dr-m-a-racist-for-defending-btn | work=The Malaysian Insider | pages= | accessdate=7 December 2009 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212223732/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45724-nazri-calls-dr-m-a-racist-for-defending-btn | archivedate=12 December 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Nazri branded Mahathir's statement "bloody racist," criticising both him and ''Utusan Malaysia'' for denying the allegations against BTN:

{{quote|Don't think that people outside do not know about the syllabus based on patriotism for Malays. ... They all know what the syllabus is all about so who are we to say that it did not happen? You want to lie? You make people laugh. I mean there are people who attended the courses who came out very angry. There were many instances of the use of words like ''ketuanan Melayu''. It is ridiculous... Do they want to say that Malaysia belongs only to the Malays and the government is only a Malay government? Should only the Malays be given the spirit of patriotism? Other races are not patriotic about their country?&lt;ref name='nazri dr m'/&gt;}}

Nazri denied that criticism from Pakatan Rakyat or the Selangor government decision were reasons for the Cabinet decision, saying: "...courses run by BTN using public funds must be used properly and it amounts to millions so if you want to talk about patriotism, patriotism for all, not just the Malays, for all Malaysians. It's not because of the Selangor state government that we changed the syllabus so it's long before that."&lt;ref name='nazri dr m'/&gt; In response, Mahathir accused Nazri of hypocrisy, saying "I must be a racist if Nazri says I am racist. Don't ever say that I am not. He knows everything. He belongs to a party which is racist... which is [[United Malays National Organisation|Umno]]. ... Umno is a party ''perkauman'' [racism] and is meant only for Malays and nobody [else] can join. So he (Nazri) is in a racist party but says he is against racism. So he should resign from the party." Mahathir is a former President of Umno, and was still a member of it and the time of making the statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=You belong to a racist party: Dr M to Nazri | date=8 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/119320 | work =Malaysiakini | pages = | accessdate = 11 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Koh Tsu Koon]], another Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, defended Nazri, saying perhaps Mahathir was unaware of the nature of BTN's curriculum: "[R]ecent feedback from participants since last year showed that the BTN course has diverted from its earlier version. Participants, including JPA [Public Services Department] scholars, felt very upset and disheartened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=G. | last=Manimaran | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Nazri finds another backer in tiff with Dr M | date=8 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45862-nazri-finds-another-backer-in-tiff-with-dr-m | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 11 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former BTN director and Member of Parliament for [[Sungai Petani]], [[Johari Abdul]] then alleged that Mahathir was responsible for changes in the BTN programme, saying that under Mahathir, BTN courses emphasised propaganda supportive of the ruling party, making claims such as "If the Umno-BN government falls, then ... the Malays would be enslaved in their own country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Syed Jaymal | last=Zahiid | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Dr M transformed BTN to a super-racist agency, says former director | date=8 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45873-dr-m-transformed-btn-to-a-super-racist-agency-says-former-director- | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 11 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Members of Parliament, such as deputy chair of the Barisan Nasional Backbenchers Club and MP for [[Kinabatangan]], [[Bung Mokhtar Radin]], argued that BTN still served a useful purpose: "I don't see it as racist. It is one of the government agencies that have taught society the characteristics of a great nation and understand the real Malaysia. BTN has also played a role since independence towards strengthening racial harmony in this country. So I really regret the actions by Pakatan state governments to prohibit the activities by BTN because BTN has never had the intention to weaken any party members but it is a platform for the public to gain knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Asrul Hadi | last=Abdullah Sani | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Umno backbenchers maintain BTN is not racist | date=9 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45989-umno-backbenchers-maintain-btn-is-not-racist- | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 11 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leaked presentation slides ==
From 11 March 2015 until 15 June 2015, BTN had published a series of presentation slides which was available on its official website. One of the presentation slides had claimed [[Malay language|Malay]] [[Small press|independent publishers]] to be "anti-establishment", in which their "movement without supervision from the authorities" will "bring a negative effect on the government" and  giving birth to "new icons of the young generation that spread extreme and free ideas".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The slide had also recommended that government officials ban any books having "explicit and free" content produced by them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerakan Indie Di Malaysia (Indie Movement in Malaysia)|url=https://archive.org/details/GerakanIndieDiMalaysia|publisher=Biro Tata Negara|accessdate=23 June 2015|language=Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BTN slaps bull’s-eye on Malay counterculture for anti-establishment bent|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/btn-slaps-bulls-eye-on-malay-counterculture-for-anti-establishment-bent|accessdate=23 June 2015|agency=Malay Mail online|date=15 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623143632/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/btn-slaps-bulls-eye-on-malay-counterculture-for-anti-establishment-bent|archivedate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has raised ire from the publishers, who had collectively made a media statement demanding a public apology from the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malay indie group strikes back at BTN, demands public apology|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/malay-indie-group-strikes-back-at-btn-demands-public-apology|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=The Malay Mail Online|date=20 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623144619/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/malay-indie-group-strikes-back-at-btn-demands-public-apology|archivedate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the incident, BTN decided to take down all the controversial slides from its website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BTN removes slides from website after caught with pants down|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/btn-removes-slides-from-website-after-caught-with-pants-down|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=The Malay Mail Online|date=15 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616175133/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/btn-removes-slides-from-website-after-caught-with-pants-down|archivedate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining that the content of the slides were meant for "academic discussion" only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No hard feelings, BTN boss tells ‘indie’ scene after attack slides leaked|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/no-hard-feelings-btn-boss-tells-indie-scene-after-attack-slides-leaked|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=The Malay Mail Online|date=16 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623145631/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/no-hard-feelings-btn-boss-tells-indie-scene-after-attack-slides-leaked|archivedate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other slides published by the agency included a slide that examined the performance of the [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) ruling coalition from 1959 to 2014 with racial breakdown of popular votes towards BN and [[Pakatan Rakyat]] (PR) seats and also percentages of Muslim and non-Muslim [[member of parliament]] (MPs) in [[Parliament of Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Politik Malaysia|url=https://archive.org/details/POLITIKMALAYSIA|publisher=Biro Tata Negara|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another slide had accused Chinese newspapers of being "fine needles that penetrate the government whilst promoting opposition movements." The national opposition party [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) is accused of using several Malay leaders to purportedly "destroy the Malay community". DAP was also accused in the slide of controlling the minds of people from [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] by invoking the issue of [[Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop of Kuala Lumpur v Menteri Dalam Negeri|the use of the name "Allah" in the context of local Christian presses]], and inciting separation of both states from Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Tarrence|title=BTN is Apartheid 2.0 in M’sia, says DAP|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/06/16/btn-is-apartheid-2-0-in-msia-says-dap/|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=Free Malaysia Today|date=16 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618195549/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/06/16/btn-is-apartheid-2-0-in-msia-says-dap/|archivedate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slide also claimed that a change in the current government will cause "political instability" in the country, bringing up comparisons with the [[Pol Pot]]'s [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|Khmer Rouge regime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perkembangan Cabaran Politik semasa dalam negara (Development of current political challenges in the country)|url=https://archive.org/details/PERKEMBANGANCABARANPOLITIKSEMASADALAMNEGARA|publisher=Biro Tata Negara|accessdate=23 June 2015|language=Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another slide presents a breakdown of a list of the 10 richest men in Malaysia, where most of them are Chinese, and also the situation of Christians "being allowed to build large churches despite only accounting for 9.1% of the total population in Malaysia".

The '''Network for Capacity Development in Nutrition''' is a working group of the [[United Nations]] Standing Committee on Nutrition (SCN).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unscn.org|title=Home - UNSCN|website=www.unscn.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCN established a set of working groups (WG) on Capacity Development (CD) in close collaboration with [[United Nations University]] (UNU).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu|title=United Nations University|website=www.unu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports are available on the Network's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agrowebcee.net/ncdn/|title=Home - NCDN|website=www.agrowebcee.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Network had an initial meeting in 2005 and five meetings between 2006 and 2010; its results are published in scientific journals.  SCN formed nine WGs, of which NCDN is one. NCDN CD nutrition includes human resource development, organizational, institutional and legal framework development.CD is a long term, continuing process. It gives primacy to national priorities, plans, policies and processes. Participants came from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Macedonia, Hungary, Poland, Republika  Srpska, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and facilitators came from the Netherlands and Norway.

The general objective of the NCDN Network is to initiate and support CD activities in research and training in [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an countries based on country-specific needs. The objectives will be linked to CEE-specific topics of interest. This is to be open for new challenges following the changes in the various countries over time.

The [[European System of Cooperative Research Networks in Agriculture (ESCORENA)]] was established in 1974 by the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] and European research institutions. It became an umbrella for cooperation between research institutions focused on food, agriculture and related fields. Since its foundation, ESCORENA has expanded to include 19 networks, including NCDN CEE. In 2009 with the financial support of [http://www.fao.org/europe/en/ FAO REU] and FAO technical support, a new server was set up in Rome to serve as common technical background for the [[AgroWeb Network]], ESCORENA and the Thematic Knowledge Networks.

'''Peace journalism''' has been developed from research that indicates that often news about conflict has a value bias toward violence.  It also includes practical methods for correcting this bias by producing journalism in both the mainstream and alternative media, and working with journalists, media professionals, audiences, and organizations in conflict.

{{TOC right|limit=2}}
This concept was proposed by [[Johan Galtung]]&lt;ref&gt;For example see the policy recommendations in the conclusion of: Galtung, J. &amp; Ruge, M. (1965).  The Structure of Foreign News: The Presentation of the Congo, Cuba and Cyprus Crises in Four Norwegian Newspapers.  Journal of Peace Research, 2, pp. 64–91.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other terms for this broad definition of peace journalism include conflict solution journalism, conflict sensitive journalism,&lt;ref name="journalismethics.ca"&gt;Howard, R. (n.d.). [http://www.journalismethics.ca/global_journalism_ethics/conflict_sensitivity_in_practice.htm Conflict Sensitive Journalism in Practice.]  Center for Journalism Ethics: School of Journalism and Mass Communication, University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Retrieved October 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; constructive conflict coverage, and reporting the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reportingtheworld.net/Homepage.html Reporting the World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''War journalism''' is journalism about conflict that has a value bias towards violence and violent groups.  This usually leads audiences to overvalue violent responses to conflict and ignore non-violent alternatives.  This is understood to be the result of well documented news reporting conventions.  These conventions focus only on physical effects of conflict (for example ignoring psychological impacts) and elite positions (which may or may not represent the actual parties and their goals). It is also biased toward reporting only the differences between parties, (rather than similarities, previous agreements, and progress on common issues) the here and now (ignoring causes and outcomes), and zero sums (assuming that one side's needs can only be met by the other side's compromise or defeat).&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan, “On the role of the media in worldwide security and peace,” In Tapio Varis (ed.),'' Peace and Communication,'' pp. 249–266, San Jose, Costa Rica: Universidad para La Paz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace journalism aims to correct for these biases. Its operational definition is "to allow opportunities for society at large to consider and value non-violent responses to conflict".&lt;ref name="Lynch, 2008, p.147"&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; This involves picking up calls for, and articulations of, non-violence policies from whatever quarter, and allowing them into the public sphere.

==Origins==
[[File:Philippines PJ group.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Used with permission of Assoc Prof. Jake Lynch|Peace journalism workshop in Mindanao, the Philippines]] 
Peace journalism follows a long history of news publication, originating in non-sectarian Christian peace movements and societies of the early 19th century, which published periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Nancy L., "Peace Journalism,"'' The International Encyclopedia of Communication,'' Wolfgang Donsbach (ed), Blackwell Publishing, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Sectarian organizations also created publications focused on peace as part of their proselytizing in the 19th century, as did utopian communities of the period. From the 20th century, a prominent example of sectarian journalism focused on peace was [[Dorothy Day]]'s'' [[Catholic Worker]].''&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Nancy L.,'' American peace writers, editors, and periodicals: A dictionary,'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being an element in the histories of [[pacifism]] and the [[social movement]] press, peace journalism is a set of [[journalism]] practices that emerged in the 1970s. Norwegian sociologist, peace researcher and practitioner [[Johan Galtung]] proposed the idea of peace journalism for journalists to follow to show how a value bias towards violence can be avoided when covering war and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Seow Ting Lee &amp; Crispin C. Maslog, "War or Peace Journalism? Asian Newspaper Coverage of Conflicts,"'' Journal of Communication 55'' (June 2005): p.&amp;nbsp;311.&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian organizations such as The [[World Council of Churches]] and The [[World Association for Christian Communication]] also practice peace journalism.

'''Peace journalism''' aims to shed light on [[social structure|structural]] and [[cultural]] causes of [[violence]], as they impact upon the lives of people in a conflict arena as part of the explanation for violence. It aims to frame conflicts as consisting of many parties and pursuing many goals rather than a simple [[dichotomy]]. An explicit aim of ''peace journalism'' is to promote peace initiatives from whatever quarter and to allow the reader to distinguish between stated positions and real goals.

==Necessity==
Peace journalism came about through research arguing there's something wrong with typical conflict reporting.  Research and practice in peace journalism outlines a number of reasons for the existence and dominance of war journalism in conflict news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Peacebuilding in the Age of New Media |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=1 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/issue/view/37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other interests===
Firstly, the notion that media elites always act to preserve their favored status quo, and their own commercial and political interests, is given relatively little weight.  Shared characteristics of the socio-economic class, which heavily influences the production of journalism, are important.  For example, their shared ideological pressures, perceptions, attitudes, and values form the basis of a "dominant reading" of facts that are selected to appear in news.  These can then act to fix and naturalize meaning and hide the actual creation of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J. &amp; McGoldrick, A. (2005).  Peace Journalism.  Gloucestershire: Hawthorn Press, p.197 &amp; p.211; also see McGoldrick, 2008, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even in the presence of powerful elite media interests against war, war journalism often dominates conflict discourse.  Lynch and McGoldrick show examples from Britain, Ireland, Georgia, and Iraq, where ''war journalism'' dominated coverage despite key influential media interests against war.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, pp.198–199.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalistic objectivity===
[[File:Jake cameraman.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Used with permission of Assoc Prof. Jake Lynch|Peace journalist Jake Lynch covering protests against joint US-Australia military exercises in Australia.]] 
Therefore, not only political and economic, but also social and cultural factors have contributed to the dominance of war journalism in conflict reporting.  With the growth of mass media, especially from the 19th century, news advertising became the most important source of media revenue.

Whole audiences needed to be engaged across communities and regions to maximize advertising revenue.  This led to "Journalistic objectivity as an industry standard…a set of conventions allowing the news to be presented as all things to all people".&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.203&lt;/ref&gt;  And in modern journalism, especially with the emergence of 24 hour news cycles, speed is of the essence in responding to breaking stories.  It is not possible for reporters to decide "from first principals" every time how they will report each and every story that presents itself.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch,J. (2008).  Debates in Peace Journalism. Sydney: Sydney University Press, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;  It follows that convention governs much of journalism.

The rise of journalistic objectivity was part of a larger movement within western academia to a more empirical "just report the facts” epistemology and research paradigm.  By the 1890s it was focused on the ideal of “objectivity”.&lt;ref&gt;Mindich, 2000, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;  And although it came into fashion around the same period, Journalistic Objectivity must be distinguished from the [[Scientific Objectivity]].  For example the experimental sciences uses as "best practice":
# Inter-laboratory replication;
# Random assignment of subjects to conditions;
# Efforts to ensure that human subjects and experimenters are ignorant of the expectations (hypotheses)of the research: to avoid the [[Observer-expectancy effect]]
# The [[Subject-expectancy effect]];
# [[Scholarly peer review#Anonymous|Anonymous peer review]], a form of [[peer review]], to promote open and systematic exploration of meaning without subjective, "political" bias;
# Careful analysis to ensure that research subjects are adequately representative of the general population, that is not overly atypical when compared to the average population.
 
While it is arguable whether these experimental science safe guards provide “true objectivity”, in the absence of these safeguards, journalism around conflict relies on three conventions to maintain its own form of "objectivity" ( also see [[journalistic objectivity]]), and is therefore distinct from [[Scientific Objectivity]].

====Conventions====
Firstly, to sell audiences to advertisers, reporting must appeal to as broad an audience as possible and therefore focuses on “facts” that  are the least controversial.  Conflict processes are often controversial, so coverage of them risks alienating potential consumers, who may be sensitive to the exposure of structural or cultural predisposing factors.&lt;ref name="Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 210"&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, a bias in favor of official sources means that, while it may appear uncontroversial, as there is only one official representative for the government on any given issue&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J. &amp; McGoldrick, A. (2009).  Day four, Sunday August 30.  Lecture presented in the Conflict Resolving Media course, the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, the University of Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt; and since only the official government is usually allowed to wield legal, sanctioned force within its territory&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, Essays in Sociology, ed./trans./intro. H. H. Gerth and C. Wright Mills (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1946, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt; 
coverage will tend to privilege violent responses to conflict over non-violent, social-psychological, context-informed responses.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists Annabel McGoldrick and Jake Lynch argue that non-critical reporting of official sources is often rewarded by those sources. Through "information transactions", these same official sources allow uncritical journalists privileged access to information in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch and McGoldrick, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly and lastly, 'dualism' biasses journalistic objectivity towards violence: "A decision to tell a story in that [bipolar] way can slip past, unnoticed, without drawing attention to itself because of its close resemblance, in shape and structure, to so much of the story-telling we already take for granted".&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp;  McGoldrick, 2005, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gatekeeping===
These conventions also form “gates” by which “gatekeepers” in journalism include or exclude various aspects of reality in final publication.&lt;ref&gt;Barzilai-Nahon, K. (2008).  Toward a Theory of Network Gatekeeping: A Framework for Exploring Information Control.  Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 59, 1493–1512;  White, D. (1950). The “gate keeper:” A case study in the selection of
news. Journalism Quarterly, 27, 383–390.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way, proponents of ''peace journalism'' argue that in the media meaning occurs according to: “a set of rules and relations established before the reality or the experience under discussion actually occurred”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''war journalism'' the objectivity conventions serve this purpose, but are shadowy and unacknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; “Gatekeeping” is therefore likely to be secretive and haphazard.  This means they distort, and also fix, meaning in conflict coverage and obfuscate the production of meaning{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S. (1997). [http://www.mediaed.org/handouts/pdfs/HALL-REPMEDIA.pdf Representation and the media.] (Transcript). Media Education Foundation.  
Northampton: United States.  Retrieved July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent example demonstrates how peace journalism evaluative criteria might be applied to show how much conventional conflict reporting is biased in favor of violence and violent groups. The example is the coverage leading up to the September 2009 meeting between Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]], and US President [[Barack Obama]].

Reporting was highly reactive and focused on the visible effects of the conflict, such as announcements and public disagreements between official spokespeople that appeared to disrupt peace efforts.&lt;ref&gt;For example see: Benhorin, Y. (2009, July, 22).  [http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3750262,00.html Mitchell, Gates, Jones to visit Jerusalem next week.], Ynetnews.com.  Retrieved October 3, 2009; Hardy, R. (2009, September 7).  [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8242387.stm  Obama Mid-East plans in jeopardy],  BBC.  Retrieved October 3, 2009; Kershner, I. (2009, September 7).

Retrieved October 3, 2009; Koutsoukis, J. (2009, September 9).  Likud rebels rebuke Netanyahu over settlements.  The Sydney Morning Herald (print edition), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coverage was oriented to elites with little mention of non-official peace efforts by individuals and groups such as the [http://www.handinhand12.org/ Hand in Hand network of schools], the Israeli/Palestinian [http://www.theparentscircle.org/Home.aspx The Parents Circle Families Forum], [https://web.archive.org/web/20040725071613/http://www.peacenow.org.il/Site/en/homepage.asp Peace Now], [http://www.shovrimshtika.org/index_e.asp Breaking the Silence], [http://www.physiciansforhumanrights.org/ Physicians for Human Rights], [http://www.machsomwatch.org/en Machsom Watch], and [http://www.canadazone.com/icw/ Checkpoint Watch], [[Hanan Ashrawi]] ([[non-violent]] activist for [[human rights]], founder of the [http://www.miftah.org/ Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and Democracy], and member of the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/world/middleeast/27swim.html We Will Not Obey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.en.justjlm.org/ Sheikh Jarrah Solidarity Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also ignored were programmes that promote cultural exchange, for example (the Israeli-Palestinian Aussie Rules football team [http://www.peaceteam.com.au/ The Peace Team]), [http://www.afl.com.au/Development/InternationalCup/Teams/PeaceTeam/tabid/12099/Default.aspx see here for official 2011 team details]) which played in the 2008 and 2011 [[Australian Football League|AFL]] International Cups. Another is the current programme of [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/new-program-fells-invisible-walls-between-arabs-and-jews-in-jerusalem-1.396223 Palestinian children's visits to the Old Yishuv Court Museum] in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem.  Events demonstrating non-violent responses to the conflict were also ignored, a new example being the March 12, 2011, [http://www.wluml.org/node/7031 Conference on Civil Disobedience in the West Bank] marking the centenary of [[International Women's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;For an outline of some of these groups' activities see Lynch, 2008; and Lynch, J. &amp; McGoldrick, A. (2005).  Peace Journalism.  Gloucestershire: Hawthorn Press&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Projects working for peace among Arabs and Israelis]] lists further organizations working for peace in the region, whose activities are generally excluded from news on the Conflict.

Reporting leading up to the September 2009 meeting between Netanyahu, Abbas and Obama focused almost solely on highly divisive issues, such as Israeli illegal settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem, and the diplomatic/official status of Jerusalem. Coverage was also oriented towards differences, with a focus on the here and now.  Potential benefits in physical, economic, and social security of peaceful relations were ignored, and “progress” towards peace was portrayed as having to come with one or more parties compromising and surrendering their positions on key issues, which is of course a [[Zero-sum|zero sum]] orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A.

Positions were presented as unchangeable on any peaceful settlement, rather than the public "face" of unmet needs that often drive violent conflicts. Because of distrust between parties these needs are often not honestly expressed publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus a pattern of ''war journalism'' emerges, largely stemming from the objectivity conventions applied to conflict reporting.  Peace journalism argues that this is likely to have important and consistent effects on the way audiences understand a conflict.

In ''war journalism'', violence is typically presented as only its own cause, ignoring the possibility of structural or psychological causes. Since violence is assumed to have no cause or explanation (such as the deprived needs of parties), conventional conflict reporting may leave viewers to conclude that the only “natural” or reasonable response to violence is more violence.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J. (2008).'' Debates in Peace Journalism,'' Sydney: Sydney University Press, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;  That “more violence—‘the only language they understand'—is an appropriate remedy”, and that non-violent responses are irrelevant or 'unrealistic'.&lt;ref name="Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 210"/&gt;

This focus on only physical violent behavior is an example of what leading Conflict Analyst and Peace Researcher, Johan Galtung identifies as a major flaw in responses to inter-communal conflict: the “Conservative Fallacy”.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. (2000).  Conflict transformation by peaceful means (the Transcend method): Pariticpants’ manual, trainers’ manual, Geneva: The United Nations,Module III, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

This bias towards prioritizing violent actors with coverage is then expected by violent groups, through what is called a [[Feedback loop|Feedback Loop]].&lt;ref&gt;First outlined by Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;  Parties to a conflict often try to use the media to advance their position, rather than being passive subjects, unaware of being observed, as assumed in sciences where humans are not the subjects. Journalist, and journalism Associate Professor, Jake Lynch notes that "it is not the influence of news on public opinion as such, but assumptions by parties to conflict about its likely or possible influence, that condition their behaviour".&lt;ref name="Lynch, 2008, p. 61"&gt;Lynch, 2008, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way ''war journalism'' is an example of the role of power in representation and of the media trying to ''fix meaning'', in this case about violence and its causes, for “it to become naturalized so that is the only meaning it can possibly carry…where you cannot see that anybody ever produced it."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S. (1997).  [http://www.mediaed.org/handouts/pdfs/HALL-REPMEDIA.pdf Representation and the media. (Transcript). Media Education Foundation, pp. 19, 21–22].  Retrieved July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, war journalism is understood as reporting on conflict in a way which imposes an artificially confined closed space, and closed time, with causes and exits existing only in the conflict arena.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J. (2008).'' Debates in Peace Journalism,'' Sydney: Sydney University Press, pp. 147, 162&lt;/ref&gt;  Peace journalism can then be understood as journalism that avoids this outside imposition, which more objectively assesses the possibility of conflicts taking place in ''open space'', and ''open time'' with any number of causes and exits.

==Effects==
The [[Salvadoran Civil War]], largely a peasant revolution, took place 1980–92. The USA supported the right-wing government. During the war 75,000 people were killed, 8,000 more went missing and another million exiled. On 17 March 1980, the village of Ingenio Colima was attacked by paramilitaries who murdered all its occupants. At the time, the country’s media gave a biased account of what took place. The intention today – in the face of open hostility from today’s political leaders is to investigate and clarify what happened and to contribute to a national process of truth and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;See www.waccglobal.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The emotional effects of ''war journalism'' also make it more difficult for audiences to be aware of this biased presentation of conflict.  ''War journalism'' takes advantage of the emotional “high” humans can get from fear through evolutionary psychological mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, pp. 291–297; McGoldrick, 2008, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  In a similar way, war journalism appeals to "lower order" needs for security and belonging.&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, A. (1970).  Motivation and Personality.  New York: Harper &amp; Row, pp. 18–21; McGoldrick, 2008, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  
The pre-frontal cortex, governing working memory, rational attentive functioning, and complex thought is inhibited by activation of the brain’s fear centre, the [[limbic system]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, B.

Audiences are thus deprived of cognitive resources with which to recognize the role of fear in encouraging ''war journalism'' consumption.  This cognitive deprivation also further fixes meaning and increases the role of “automatically activated attitudes” which according to cognitive psychology: "guide attention toward attitude-consistent information, provide a template with which to interpret ambiguous information, and…guide behaviour in a relatively spontaneous fashion".&lt;ref&gt;Olson, M. and Fazio, O.  (2006).  Reducing automatically activated racial prejudice through implicit evaluative conditioning.  Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 32, 421–433, see p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Therefore viewers are primed to pay more attention to future information, which is consistent with the automatically activated attitudes formed by ''war journalism''.  Research into the ever present framing{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} in the media supports this conclusion: “Certainly people can recall their own facts, forge linkages not made explicitly in the text, or retrieve from memory a causal explanation or cure that is completely absent from the text. In essence, this is just what professors encourage their students to do habitually.  But Zaller (1992), Kahneman and Tversky (1984), and Iyengar (1991), among others, suggest that on most matters of social or political interest, people are not generally so well-informed and cognitively active, and that framing therefore heavily influences their responses to communications”.&lt;ref&gt;Entman, R, (1993). Framing: towards clarification of a fractured paradigm’, Journal of Communication, 43, 51–58, see p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that ''war journalism'' can have negative emotional impacts on audience members. These include feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness, compounded by increased anxiety, mood disturbance, sadness and a sense of disconnection with physical and social environments.  Research by Galtung and Ruge (1965) finds negativity bias in foreign news. This has also been confirmed more recently by Nohrstedt and Ottosen (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. &amp; Ruge, M. (1965).  The Structure of Foreign News: The Presentation of the Congo, Cuba and Cyprus Crises in Four Norwegian Newspapers.  Journal of Peace Research, 2, pp. 64–91; Nohrstedt, S. &amp; Ottosen, R. (2008).  War journalism and the Threat Society.  Conflict and Communication Online, 7, pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;  
This can affect reactions towards the conflict itself, and an audience’s general psychological wellbeing, which biasses their view of the world as excessively chaotic and may cause serious anxiety and emotional difficulties, and a sense of disempowerment and disconnection.&lt;ref&gt;Frohlich, G. (2004).  [http://www.aspr.ac.at/epu/research/Frohlich.pdf Emotional intelligence in Peace Journalism.],  Master of Arts Thesis.  European University Center for Peace Studies, pp.17, 47.

Vicarious trauma can increase these negative effects, where "even ‘normal’, intelligent, educated individuals can become highly suggestible towards violent acts in formerly unexpected contexts".&lt;ref&gt;Frohlich, 2004, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

These negative emotional states may discourage audience members from criticism and challenge of the biassed information presented through war journalism.  These public concerns may appear to be "someone else’s problem" and best left to "experts", who alone have the necessary knowledge, time, and emotional endurance. These negative emotional responses may also discourage creative engagement with the conflict and conflict parties.  This is especially troubling considering the critical role of creativity in conflict resolution and peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, R. J. (1997).  Interactive Conflict Resolution.

==Feedback loop==
Peace journalism analysis suggests that  typical news on conflict, with its value bias towards violence and violent groups, has important effects on the parties to conflict.  Firstly, peace journalism proponents argue that the bias in favour of publicity for violence and violent actors, "plays into" the interests of violent actors to intimidate and disrupt  the peace process.&lt;ref&gt;Frohlich, 2004, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an important example of the Feedback Loop effect: "it is not the influence of news on public opinion as such, but assumptions by parties to conflict about its likely or possible influence, that condition their behaviour".&lt;ref name="Lynch, 2008, p. 61"/&gt;  This bias also weakens and punishes, with less publicity, non-violent groups affected by a conflict, for their lack of violence.  Nohrstedt and Ottosen (2002) note:
"if traditional media themselves are unable to transmit alternative perspectives and voice the danger is that those […] that feel marginalised will turn to terror in order to make a difference in the media agenda".&lt;ref&gt;Nohrstedt &amp; Ottosen 2002, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most visible actions of a group, of which one is not a member, are often considered representative of that group’s behaviour (an effect called the “availability heuristic”).&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, A. J. &amp; Hardin, C. D. (1997).  Differential use of the availability heuristic in social judgement.  Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, 123-138.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore war journalism's over-selection of violent, as opposed to non-violent, responses to conflict may actually foster a misperception of excessive threat between parties.  This is then generally exaggerated by other inter-group social-cognitive biases within war journalism.  These include biases towards: seeing an outgroup as more homogeneous (with less internal variety) than it really is, ignoring the variety of attitudes towards the conflict;&lt;ref&gt;Boldry, J.

Indeed Dr. Louis Kriesberg, a sociologist at Syracuse University, and expert on conflict resolution points out that: "conventional thinking among partisans in a fight generally attributes destructive persistence in a conflict to the enemy's character, asserting that the enemy is aggressive by nature, has evil leaders, or adheres to a hostile ideology".&lt;ref&gt;Kriesberg, Louis, ‘Waging conflicts constructively’ in Handbook of Conflict Analysis and Resolution (London: Routledge, 2009), p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; And Professor of World Religions, Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution, Marc Gopin, agrees with the importance of psychological factors in escalating conflict: "being hated normally generates deep injury and corresponding anger in most recipients is what I call a "conflict dance" of action/reaction".&lt;ref&gt;Gopin, Marc, ‘Conflict Resolution as a Religious Experience: Contemporary Mennonite Peacemaking’ in Between Eden and Armageddon: The Future of World Religions, Violence and Peacemaking (Oxford: Oxford U.P., 2000), p.143.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''peace journalism'' perspective also highlights another effect of typical conflict journalism on  the groups engaged in a conflict: ''war journalism's'' common focus on the human drama and tragedy of violence. Hamber and Lewis (1997) note war journalism "often involves painting doomsday scenarios of victims who are irreparably damaged and for whom there appears to be no solution and no future".&lt;ref&gt;Hamber, B &amp; Lewis, S.

Effective non-violent bridge building between communities such as the Hand in Hand Arab/Jewish school network in Israel, are routinely ignored in ''war journalism'' coverage.  Non-violent initiatives illustrate what can be possible through peaceful responses to conflict but this information is artificially "filtered out" through the coverage biases of ''war journalism''.&lt;ref&gt;For example see:Alpher, Y.

Parties are led to believe that that violence is the only way their needs can be met, thereby reinforcing and escalating cycles of dangerous retaliation between groups.  ''Peace journalism'' would also charge that this pattern of conventional conflict reporting submerges the emotional cost of violent conflict and therefore makes the psychological aspects of cycles of revenge subtle, and so more difficult to prevent.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, S. &amp; Maslog, C, &amp; Kim, H.

All of this missed information could represent a crucial movement away from violence, as the only option for threatened groups towards peace. But only if they are not hidden by journalistic assumptions that they are irrelevant, and should not be reported. This is of special concern, given that the [[collective trauma]] suffered by a population, and the fear that this generates, can lead to a reduced capacity for decision making and action.&lt;ref&gt;Etter, J.

==Response==
In response to war journalism’s value bias in favour of violence, peace journalism promises two key benefits: for those concerned with objectivity in journalism, it aims to avoid and counteract the persistent bias of valuing violence and violent parties. Secondly, as all journalism must in some way appeal to the values of their audiences, for those who value the promotion of peace and social justice over violence, it provides a practical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodny-Gumede |first1=Ylva |title=Awareness towards Peace Journalism among Foreign Correspondents in Africa |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=1 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i1.365 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'fixation of meaning'{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} in war journalism is often hidden by the “scattered opposition facts” that often occur in its coverage. However these do not actually allow for “challenging a dominant frame” of pro-violence: 'Framing' researcher Entman recommends:
"If educated to understand the difference between including scattered oppositional facts, and challenging a dominant frame, journalists might be better equipped to construct news that makes equally salient—equally accessible to the average, inattentive, and marginally informed audience—two or more interpretations of problems."&lt;ref&gt;Entman, R. (1993). Framing: towards clarification of a fractured paradigm, Journal of Communication, 43, 51-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decisions===
Hence, ''peace journalism'' is anchored in Conflict Analysis and Peace Research “to map out solid ground beneath our feet; to declare, in advance, that we intend to use it, to assign meanings and draw distinctions.”&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Decisions, on which of the almost infinite stories and facts to report, can be made openly and systematically. Lynch (2008) shows how these two disciplines are important anchors for ''conflict journalism'' in that they employ the academic rigor of the social sciences including: "openness about – and prepared to justify – starting assumptions for both observation and interpretation; and peer review.  Built into social science, moreover, is an allowance for the [[participant-observer effect]] – as soon as you start to observe something, you cannot avoid changing it."&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

As such ''peace journalism'' considers the effect it has on audiences and parties with regard to it own “objectivity”.  Lynch and Galtung (2010) elaborate on how this operates in ''conflict journalism'': "'It is an important distinction in this context because journalism itself may be part of the extended pattern of conflictual relationships, in which parties and their shared relations find themselves embedded – if only by bringing an audience to the ringside. Tillett comments: 'In some situations, individuals (or groups) will ‘fight to the death’ (even when obviously losing all that they claim to be seeking) to avoid being seen to ‘back down’ or ‘lose face' ' (1999, p.&amp;nbsp;29). In a conflict, he continues, "the presence of an audience generally makes it more likely that the protagonists will want to be seen to win, and that they will be less prepared to resolve than to fight'. Schattschneider goes as far as to argue that spectators are 'an integral part of the situation for, as likely as not, the audience determines the outcome of the fight'(1960, p.2)."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Lynch, J. &amp; Galtung, J. (2010).  Reporting conflict: New  directions in peace journalism.  St. Lucia: University of Queensland Press, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-group violence===
Conflict Analysis also provides guidance on mapping the hopes, needs, and fears of all parties to a conflict, including outwardly “impartial” third parties; and acknowledges the potential role of creativity, rather than assuming as ''war journalism'' does, that the positions of elites, power gradients and the struggle for power are the most important determinants of a conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, D. (2002).  People, peace and power: Conflict transformation in action.  London: Pluto Press, p.128; Lederach, J. P. (1997) Building Peace: Sustainable Reconciliation in Divided Societies.  Washington, DC: US Institute of Peace Press, p.94; Lynch, 2008, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

These can then be assessed empirically in the conflict, and its potential resolution, rather than being ignored from the outset by journalists, as often is the case in ''war journalism''.  Therefore the importance in ''peace journalism'' of being willing to consider conflict as “open in space and time, with causes and exits anywhere”.&lt;ref name="Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.6"&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;   Lynch and Galtung (2010) present an important example of this in the case of North and South Korea, indicating that journalists should not ignore the grassroots people that endure this conflict, and that comparisons and input from the reunified Germany may be helpful, as could consideration and dialogue with East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch and Galtung, 2010, pp.77-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The aim here is not to impose definite “answers”. Conflict Analysis and Peace Research often elicit useful perspectives from those involved in the conflict. Empirical questions can then be put forward, and tested by investigative journalism.

These processes demonstrate that conflict is not static and intractable.  These insights challenge the psychological tendencies of ''war journalism'' noted above to present negative outgroup behaviour as the result of stable group characteristics.  Indeed the non-linear cycle of violence outlined by Elworthy and Rogers (2002), proposes that the key stage to prevent a cycle of revenge, is before the anger becomes bitterness.&lt;ref name="oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk"&gt;Elworthy, S. &amp; Rogers, P. (2002).  [http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/waronterrorism.pdf The ‘War on Terrorism’: 12-month audit and future strategy options], Oxford: Oxford Research Group, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;  And peace journalism can allow for the consideration that “bitterness can be thought of as anger + memory[…]storing away trauma in a ‘trauma bank’ and, eventually, withdrawing it as ‘glory’ through further violence”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

Through reporting, which does not routinely ignore causes and non-linear cycles of violence, ''peace journalism'' can help expand the cognitive and emotional space for peace initiatives that contribute peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Elworthy and Rogers, 2002, pp.18-24; Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.87; Perez, M. (n.d.).  [http://www.transcend.org/tri/downloads/Peace%20Journalism%20Case%20Study-%20US%20Media%20Coverage%20of%20the%20War%20in%20Iraq.pdf Peace Journalism case study: US media coverage of the war in Iraq.]  Transcend Research Institute.  Retrieved 10 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Feedback Loop of cause and effect in the media could then support the creation and continuation of peaceful process-structures .&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1999, pp.33-35.&lt;/ref&gt;  This would involve demonstrating a pattern of coverage that leads present and potential peace actors to predict that their efforts will be reported by journalists to “create opportunities for society at large to consider and value non-violent responses to conflict”.&lt;ref name="Lynch, 2008, p.147"/&gt;  This in turn could reduce negative inter-group social-psychological tendencies.  This may be particularly important for projects such as the examples in Israel/Palestine of the 'Hand in Hand' network of schools, 'Peace Now', 'Breaking the Silence', 'Physicians for Human Rights', 'Machsom Watch' and 'Checkpoint Watch', which as mainly grassroots initiatives, are generally more fragile than mid level or upper level peace activities.&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
As a pedagogical practice, peace journalism training often uses pairs of ''war journalism'' and ''peace journalism'' reports to illustrate how the same story can be reported in either style, and that there is the potential to produce peace journalism within the time and travel constraints of mainstream journalism.

The piece does not assume there are only two parties, and doesn't assume parties' goals exactly match reported positions, and explores contradictory goals within a single official party.  It also reports on peaceful responses to conflict.  This report however is generally closed in space and time: with little exploration of the reasons behind the conflict between waring groups (including  considering the conduct of the weak national government), or whether parties other than Al Queda/Al Shabab have used violence, and assumes that causes and sources of solutions are restricted to within Somalia itself.  The report also does not explore non-elite efforts at peace, even though [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/somalis-rally-against-al-qaeda-allies/story-e6frf7jx-1226272294958 Somalis rally against al-Qaeda allies] suggests that there is local support for peace efforts.

The [[feedback loop]] of cause and effect&lt;ref&gt;Lynch and McGoldrick, 2005, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; is a useful reference point here for conceptualising the various “entry points” for peace journalism in the wider phenomenology of news.  ''Peace journalism'' has been applied in training and dialogue with journalists in a variety of settings.&lt;ref&gt;For example see Lynch, 2008, pp.35-36, p.81, p.84, p.85 &amp; p.87; Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, pp.135-136&lt;/ref&gt;  However peace journalism has also been applied in a number of other sectors.

These interventions are extremely varied and, in addition to the examples noted above, include international NGO work with local partners and networks in areas of conflict,&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, p.196&lt;/ref&gt; the promotion of communication rights, participatory processes, community-based communication approaches for development, and social change and peacebuilding (for example see [http://www.communicationforsocialchange.org/current-projects Current Projects-Communication for Social Change] &amp;  [http://www.waccglobal.org/en/programmes.html World Association for Christian Communication programmes] and further reading sections below) and work with organisations who may themselves become sources for peace journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick,2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Government and inter-governmental approaches have also facilitated ''peace journalism'' in preventing [[media manipulation]] and promoting people centred media in post-conflict societies and through the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Such as Thompson, M. &amp; Price, M. (2003).   Intervention, media and human rights, Survival, 45, pp.183-202; Krug, P. &amp; Price, M. (2002).

==Criticism==
Peace journalism has aroused a number of debates and criticisms from scholars and journalists.

===Objectivity===
Some opponents characterise ''peace journalism'' as "activist" new writing that, while being socially engaged to promote peace, is unlike mainstream objective, or balanced, news coverage that seeks to remain impartial or above the fray.&lt;ref&gt;for example see Hanitzsch, 2007, pp.367–385.&lt;/ref&gt;

This raises the important question: how objective and impartial is peace journalism?  From a peace journalism perspective the claim “we just report the facts” must include the facts of how and according to what principals these “facts” came to meet the reporter, and how the finished coverage came to meet the facts.  The Press Institute of India’s conflict reporting guidelines point out: "Factual accuracy in a single story is no substitute for the total truth.  A single story, which is factually accurate can nonetheless be misleading".&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd &amp; Toit, 1999, cited in Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

As such ''peace journalism'' is generally more objective, with its inclusion of implications for international law, positive developments in both elite peacemaking and capacity building, and non-elite perspectives and peacebuilding initiatives.  This objectivity, unconstrained by Objectivity Conventions, highlights the truth-orientation of peace journalism: to “expose untruths on all sides”.&lt;ref name="Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.6"/&gt;

In doing so ''peace journalism'' aims to de-naturalise{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} meaning by highlighting the creation of ''war journalism'' dominated meaning in conflict.  Indeed Hall (1997) recommends that the unfixing of meaning: “is often a struggle to increase the diversity of things which subjects can be of the possibility of identities which people have not seen represented before[…]you have to intervene in exactly that powerful exchange between image and its psychic meaning[…]with which we invest images [and] expose and deconstruct the work of representation which the stereotype is doing”.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 1997, pp.20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

And many international negotiation experts and peace practitioners note the importance of non-violent confrontation and the equalisation of power, before effective negotiation and dialogue between parties can take place.&lt;ref&gt;Docherty, J. (2005).  The little book of strategic negotiation: Negotiating during turbulent times.  Intercourse: Good Books, p.22; Francis, 2002, pp.56-57; Keashly, L. &amp; Fisher, R. J.

Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, p.32;  Cortright, D. (2008).  Peace: A history of Movements and Ideas.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.227.&lt;/ref&gt;  Through reporting on grassroots and local voices for peace, the power of these voices is increased, as they become "reality checkers" for often contradictory statements from elite representatives involved in violence.  Through this non-violent “ideational confrontation”, audiences and parties to conflict may be more able to negotiate their own meaning, outside of fixed elite narratives.  Thus “mounting anomalies may expose contradictions, and herald a paradigm shift” as local pro-peace perspectives previously consigned to a zone of “deviance” become “legitimate controversy”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.205&lt;/ref&gt;

However the military’s promotion of relationship building as a legitimate tactic to attempt in addressing violence does contribute to the normative strength of non-violence responses to conflict.  In acknowledging the importance of (at least being seen to) build cooperative relationships with local populations (over simply violently suppressing disagreement to military policy) the legitimacy of these non-violent responses to violence conflict is reinforced.

'''Peace journalism''' aims to retain the role of ''observer'' in reporting conflict, rather than functioning like ''war journalism'', which intervenes in conflict to increase the influence of violent actors and violent actions.  Peace journalism, by presenting “anomalous” local perspectives which contradict violence-exacerbating war journalism, may help to expose these violent group’s attempts to fix and naturalise{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} meaning and to take advantage of this meaning to promote their violence.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2005, pp.204-205&lt;/ref&gt;  
Indeed, exploration of new types of relationships between Afghan locals and the international community, contradicts assertions made at the time, with the support of war journalism, by insurgents and the US government, that the negative effects of foreign occupation could only be ended with their violent expulsion, or that 40,000 more combat troops were the most critical component for sustainable peace in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of this war journalism see: Dombey, D.

===Explaining violence is justifying it===
This criticism can be represented by [[neo-conservative]] proponent [[Richard Perle]], that one must “decontextualise terror[…]any attempt to discuss the roots of terrorism is an attempt to justify it.  It simply needs to be fought and destroyed”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;  While this may be a common response to journalism which advocates context, it is also an example of many of the social-cognitive inter-group biases noted above, and exemplifies what social psychologist [[Phillip Zimbardo]] (of the Stanford Prison Experiments) calls a ''Fundamental Attribution Error'': “the tendency to explain observed behaviour by reference to dispositions, while ignoring or minimizing the impact of situational variables”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimbardo, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of human needs driving violence and being significantly effected by violence (borrowed from Conflict Analysis and Peace Research)&lt;ref&gt;Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, pp.44-47&lt;/ref&gt; and insight into the stratified nature of reality (borrowed from Critical Realism),&lt;ref name="Dandermark pp.59-66"&gt;Dandermark et al. (2002) Explaining society – Critical Realism in the Social Sciences, London: Routledge, see particularly pp.59-66&lt;/ref&gt; highlights why an ''explanation'' of violence is not the same thing as a justification for it.

Critical Realism understands reality as existing in a number of levels or [[Stratified sampling|strata]]. Each strata deals with larger and more complex phenomena than that ones below it.  These strata might begin from physical mechanisms at the most basic level, followed by chemical mechanisms, then biological, followed by psychological and finally social.  Activity at each lower strata contributes to, but can never fully explain, the new mechanisms that develop in higher strata, in a process called “emergence” from the upper strata.  For example, competing theories of sub-atomic structure (perhaps at the physical level) influence but cannot fully explain the outcome of the reaction 2Na+2HCl = 2NaCl + H2 (at the chemical level).  Likewise the individual psychologies of a landlord and tenant cannot fully explain their relationship in the social strata, which is also influenced by other  things that operate at the social stratum, including laws and culture.&lt;ref name="Dandermark pp.59-66"/&gt;

Structural and cultural explanations for violence generally deal with the social strata: that is relationships between people and groups. An explanation of this violence is not the same as ignoring the role of individual choice and psychology: the violence that “emerges” at the social level is the result of a complex interaction of influences from lower strata (individual choices and psychology) and structures which exist primarily at the social strata (such as laws and culture).  So to give cultural or structural ''explanations'' of violence is not the same as saying that these social influences override the role the individual choice (which is located in a lower stratum and therefore occurs under different conditions).

Take the case where an individual’s anger (brought on from previous trauma) becomes bitterness, which is followed by their own violent acts, following Elworthy and Rogers (2002) cycle of violence noted above.&lt;ref name="oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk"/&gt; An individual has still made a choice to deprive the victim of their violence of their human needs (probably safety and security) even though their own human needs have also been violated earlier.  The point is not that they must be seen as  either a innocent victim or an evil perpetrator.  The practical point is the prevention of violence, and the healing of all those whose needs have been violated.

This approach does not assume that the best solution for stopping individual violence necessarily exists at the level where an individual makes a choice to act violently (which happens at the psychological level).  In some cases punishment or imprisonment may be necessary.  However Conflict Analysis and Peace Research suggest that, given the failure of the psychological, medical and social sciences (including education) to eliminate the persistent rates of psychotic tendencies in human groups (psychologists estimate that on average 3 percent of any population have psychotic tendencies),&lt;ref&gt;Collier, P.  (2007). 
The bottom billion: Why the poorest countries are falling apart and what can be done about it.  Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; a more promising approach may to look at what social, economic, cultural conditions and what inter-group relations enable individuals such as Hitler, Osama Bin Laden, Stalin and Pol Pot, to realise their desire for mass violence.

Conflict Analysis and Peace Research does not primarily focus on understanding the individual psychology of these individuals (at the psychological stratum), but on how these individuals may be prevented from taking up a position in society where they are able to direct inter-communal violence (at the social stratum).

Indeed in ''peace journalism'' the role of individual agency is given a lot of importance.  For example journalists are encouraged, in peace journalism workshops, to work peace journalism into the existing media structures.  And peace journalism urges journalists to investigate the possibility that, even in violent situations, there are always voices for peace, and to search these voices out, when reporting what the Objectivity Conventions might ignore from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, pp.6-31; Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, pp.51-63&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise the role of individual choice is not ignored in Conflict Analysis and Peace Research, and leading scholar-practitioner, John Paul Lederach notes that:
“I have not experienced any situation in conflict, no matter how protracted or severe, from Central America to the Philippines to the Horn of Africa, where there have not been people who had a vision for peace, emerging often from their own experience of pain.  Far too often, however, these same people people are overlooked and disempowered either because they do not represent ‘official’ power, whether on the side of government [or] of the various militias, or because they are written off as biased and too personally affected by the conflict".&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure versus agency===
Hanitzsche (2007) argues that “the failures of corporate journalism cannot be overcome by an individualistic and voluntaristic conceptualization of news making. To have any impact on the ways news is being made, and the critical discussion thereof, the advocates of peace journalism must address the structural constraints of news production[…]a peaceful culture is the precondition of peace journalism."&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsche, 2007, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;
Structure is a key concern in peace journalism, along with the influence of structure on ''content pluralism'' in news.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;  And a number of projects that apply ''peace journalism'' (some of which are outlined above) demonstrate that ''peace journalism activism'' is not limited to journalists themselves. Indeed, conflict media content analyses are important educational resources for audiences, NGOs and journalists, to show how deficiencies in content can be used to campaign for more structural pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.28 ; For examples of content analyses see: Galtung &amp; Lynch, 2010; Lee &amp; Masalog, 2005; Lee, Masalog &amp; Kim, 2006; Baltodano, B.,  Jared Bishop, J., Hmielowski, J., Kang-Graham, J., Morozov, A., White, B., et al. (2007).  Discourses of Blame and Responsibility: U.S./Canadian Media Representations of Palestinian-Israeli Relations.  Conflict and Communication Online, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

These varied approaches demonstrate that inroads have been, and are still being made, in ''peace journalism activism'' in the areas Hackett (2006) identifies as necessary to address challenges of structure and to "make peace journalism possible”: reforming journalism from within, and also creating alternative media organisations, and intervening in the broader fields in which journalism find itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, 2006, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audiences===
Hanitszche (2007) criticises peace journalism, noting that media users are often “fragmented and active audiences instead of a passive mass[…]leading to a selective use of supplied products”.&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2007).  Situating peace journalism in journalism studies: a critical appraisal, Conflict and Communication Online 6, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise Devereux (2003) notes that media audiences “may have different expectations of media genres”&lt;ref&gt;Devereux, E. (2003).  Understanding the media.  London: Sage Publications, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; and Turnbull (2002) argues that in media research a serious problem is just to limit and define audiences and therefore relevant media practices.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, S. (2002).  Audiences. In Stuart Cunningham &amp; Graeme Turner (Eds.), The media &amp; communications in Australia (pp. 65-77). Crows Nest: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed Hall (1997) notes that the meaning of media messages changes “as you move from one person to another, one group to another, one part of society to another.”&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 1997, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  And Lynch (2008) points out, drawing from Hall (1980) that “the meanings of media messages are made, at least partly, at the point of reception, in a process influenced chiefly by the socio-economic position of the reader or viewer.”&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such Hall (1980) notes that in a negotiated or oppositional manner, ''meaning'' often:
"contains a mixture of adaptive and oppositional elements: it acknowledges the legitimacy of the hegemonic definitions to make the grand significations (abstract), while, at a more restricted, situational (situated) level, it makes its own ground rules - it operates with exceptions to the rule. It accords the privileged position to the dominant definitions of events while reserving the right to make a more negotiated application to 'local conditions'".And indeed for many peace journalists it is the visibility of 'local conditions' that allows for oppositional and negotiated meaning. Lynch (2008)argues that “for audiences to produce oppositional or negotiated readings of media messages assumes they have enough directly relevant personal and social experience against which to measure them”,&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is often not the case with international conflict. Indeed Hall’s(1980) own example of the negotiation of meaning is the case of an industrial factory worker, willing to challenge official justifications in the media for an Industrial Relations Bill limiting his or her right to strike.{{Citation needed|reason=ref was given as (ref name=Hall, 1980, p.516 /), no full ref provided|date=November 2018}}

''Peace journalism'' analysis shows that the facts absent in audiences’ understanding of conflict, can closely mirror those neglected in ''war journalism''. A notable example is Philo and colleagues’ research into media coverage of the Israel/Palestine conflict in the UK media.&lt;ref&gt;Philo, G. (2004, July 14). What you get in 20 seconds. Guardian; Philo, G. (2009).  News, audiences and the construction of public knowledge.  In S. Allan (Ed.), The Routledge Companion to News and Journalism (pp.407-506). Abingdon:   Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  With mainstream media neglecting the Palestinian narrative that Palestinian refugees lost their land and homes when Israel was established, audiences exhibited consistent ignorance about the basic facts of the conflict (for example where the bulk of refugees came from) and tended to perceive Palestinians as “starting the violence” and therefore Israeli authorities as forced to “respond” violently to prevent or contain this action, which has no possible rationale and therefore no potential non-violent resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Philo, 2009, p.502&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed five years earlier, when reporting results of the study, Philo (2004) noted that: "This pattern of reporting clearly influenced how some viewers understood the conflict[…]The gaps in public knowledge closely parallel those in the news. The Palestinian perspective, that they have lost their land and are living under occupation, was effectively absent. It is perhaps not surprising that some viewers believed that they were simply being aggressive and trying to take land from the Israelis".&lt;ref&gt;Philo, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This omission of the Palestinian perspective was so serious that Helen Boaden, Head of News at the BBC, concluded in an internal email: “we fail to give enough context and history to this highly charged story and that we neglect the Palestinian narrative[…]In our response, we’ve tried to come up with practical ways to remedy our weaknesses”.&lt;ref&gt;cited in Lynch, 2008, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli–Palestinian conflict has also been the focus of research by Yifat Mor and colleagues, who examined how social media (namely [[Facebook]]) can be a tool to promote dialogue between both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mor |first1=Yifat |last2=Ron |first2=Yiftach |last3=Maoz |first3=Ifat |title=“Likes” for Peace: Can Facebook Promote Dialogue in the Israeli–Palestinian Conflict? |journal=Media and Communication |volume=4 |issue=1 |doi=10.17645/mac.v4i1.298 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an important illustration of the consistent effect of war journalism across general audiences: “the pattern of misunderstanding almost exactly matching[…]missing elements from the story habitually presented in the mainstream media”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;  General media audiences as a group are conceptualised within the Feedback Loop of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;First outlined in Lynch &amp; McGoldrick, 2005, p.216&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approaches===
Two peace practitioner scholars, John Paul Lederach and Johan Galtung present two quite different models for conflict resolution and peace building. Lederach (1995) presents an “Elictive Model” which is aims “primarily at discovery, creation, and solidification of models that emerge from the resources present in a particular setting and respond to needs in that context” and to not impose third party knowledge from trainer to participant.&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1995, p.55 &amp; p.62&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach, was applied in a dialogue in 2003 entitled “Reporting the[sic?] Iraq: what went right?  What went wrong?”. Included were Heads of News from the BBC and CNN, the editor of the Guardian, and several senior reporters who had also been reporting the war from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.201; Lynch &amp; Galtung, 2010, p.135.&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing on “the resources in the room” recommendations for the coverage of conflict included: 
#Do not report a ‘line’ from an official source without obtaining and citing independent evidence as to its reliability.
#Acknowledge that the important job of testing arguments is best done if they are juxtaposed with, and weighed against, alternative, countervailing arguments.
#All newsrooms genuinely interested in offering a service to the public must think long and hard about ‘conduit’ journalism and, in particular, whether their political correspondents are being used in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, pp.204-206.&lt;/ref&gt;
#

Galtung’s TRANSCEND approach in contrast, focuses on the role a third party to “unstick” violent conflicts and stimulate creativity. This is done by  probing deeply into the nature of parties’ goals, expanding the spectrum of acceptable solutions, and opening up cognitive space for fresh potentialities not conceived of by conflict parties.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. &amp; Tschudi, F. (2001). Crafting Peace: On the Psychology of the TRANSCEND Approach.  In D. J. Christie, R. V. Wagner, &amp; D. D. Winter (Eds), Peace, Conflict, and Violence. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, see pp.210-212&lt;/ref&gt;  "In one-on-one conversation-style dialogues, the task is to stimulate creativity, develop new perspectives, and make the conflict parties 'ready for the table'".&lt;ref&gt;Galtung and Tschudi, (2001), pp.210&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch (2008) recounts a notable example of this approach during a ''peace journalism'' forum of Middle Eastern journalists, in Amman, in 1999.  Discussions often devolved into national groups blaming the journalists of the other countries for not confronting their governments’ lack of movement towards peace. Galtung himself challenged the participants to: “imagine a future Middle East they wanted to see, and start to think aloud, in cross-national groups, about how they might play a part in bringing it about”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

A Galtungian perspective, as a foundation for much of ''peace journalism'', insists that “the journalist focus on root causes of conflict such as poverty or prior abuse, and not merely focus on events associated with violent political encounters”.&lt;ref&gt;.Falk, R. (2008).  Foreword.  In J. Lynch (Author), Debates in Peace Journalism (pp.v-x).  Sydney: University of Sydney Press, see p.vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Through this approach peace journalism could act to “disembed” seemingly immutable official positions from the greater context of a conflict by exploring background to a conflict, challenging propaganda, and making visible official and local initiatives for peaceful conflict resolution.

These two approaches differ not only in the "how" of [[Conflict Resolution]] but the "who".  Lederach generally outlines a "middling out" approach where "the level with the greatest potential for establishing an infrastructure that can sustain the peacebuilding process over the long term appears to be the middle range".&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that grassroots approaches are generally the more fragile since their participants are often concerned with day to day issues of survival.&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, pp.51-52&lt;/ref&gt;  Upper level approaches assume a high level of integration between elites and grassroots: that peace agreements reached there "are relevant to and capable of practical implementation at the local level"&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, 1997, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;  Galtung on the other hand argues that upper level leaders often actually feel excluded from facilitated peace processes, with the modern focus on grassroots and civil society initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. (2010, July 7).  Self-Determination: 50 years on.  Workshop presented at the 2010 biennial conference of the International Peace Research Association, Customs House, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;  The root of conflict is ''incompatible goals'', pursued by parties which result in violent attitudes and behavior. It follows that "people are more able to discuss a root problem when they sense a solution somewhere.  A glimmer of light at the end of a tunnel makes it considerably more easy[sic] to admit that we are in a tunnel".&lt;ref&gt;Galtung and Tschudi, (2001), pp.210-211&lt;/ref&gt;  In Galtung's work, the most accessible way to influence these goals had been to work with those who officially defined them and led policy—the upper level leaders.

The importance of accurate and complete [[Conflict Analysis]] for a given conflict highlights how these two approaches can be complementary. Practical [[Conflict Analysis]] is often aimed at identifying the easiest "peace levers" to pull, within a conflict to "unstick" violent inter-group relations. This contrasts with intervening in a conflict with pre-set ideas of how a resolution will be found, and with which specific level or group to begin working.

Therefore [[Conflict Analysis]] may indicate which "entry points" offer the most promising chance to transform the relations between parties. And from this it will follow which approach, or combination of approaches, are likely to work from that entry point (whether it be at the grassroots, mid level or upper level or a combination). This integrative approach is summed up by peace practitioner and researcher Wendy Lambourne: "to rely on only one theoretical approach in peace practice risks being culturally blind".&lt;ref&gt;Personal communication, 27 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar approaches==
Sometimes also called [[conflict solution journalism]], [[conflict sensitive journalism]],&lt;ref name="journalismethics.ca"/&gt; and [[constructive conflict coverage]].  A similar approach is also found in [[preventive journalism]], which extends the principles to social, economic, environmental or institutional problems. Peace journalism is one of several approaches and movements in journalism history, including [[advocacy journalism]], [[development communication]] journalism, the [[new journalism]], and public or [[civic journalism]], which reject the universal or hegemonic claims to neutrality of professional journalism in the developed West.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hanitzsch, “Deconstructing Journalism Culture: Toward a Universal Theory,”'' Communication Theory 17'' (2007) p.368.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46465">{{Postmodernism}}
'''Postmodern art''' is a body of art movements that sought to contradict some aspects of [[modernism]] or some aspects that emerged or developed in its aftermath. In general, movements such as [[intermedia]], [[installation art]], [[conceptual art]] and [[multimedia]], particularly involving video are described as [[Postmodernism|postmodern]].

There are several characteristics which lend art to being postmodern; these include [[bricolage]], the use of text prominently as the central artistic element, [[collage]], [[abstract art|simplification]], [[appropriation art|appropriation]], [[performance art]], the recycling of past styles and themes in a modern-day context, as well as the break-up of the barrier between [[fine arts|fine]] and [[high culture|high arts]] and [[low culture|low art]] and [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ideas About Art'', Desmond, Kathleen K. [https://books.google.com/books?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;dq=ideas+about+art&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International postmodernism: theory and literary practice'', Bertens, Hans [https://books.google.com/books?id=n_Eqx2Gr1vUC&amp;dq=international+postmodernism:+theory+and+literary+practice&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], Routledge, 1997, p.236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the term==
The predominant term for art produced since the 1950s is "[[contemporary art]]". Not all art labeled as contemporary art is postmodern, and the broader term encompasses both artists who continue to work in modernist and [[Late modernity|late modernist]] traditions, as well as artists who reject postmodernism for other reasons. [[Arthur Danto]] argues "contemporary" is the broader term, and postmodern objects represent a "subsector" of the contemporary movement.&lt;ref&gt;''After the End of Art: Contemporary Art and the Pale of History'' [[Arthur C. Danto]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some postmodern artists have made more distinctive breaks from the ideas of modern art and there is no consensus as to what is "late-modern" and what is "post-modern." Ideas rejected by the modern aesthetic have been re-established. In painting, postmodernism reintroduced representation.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Steiner, ''Venus in Exile: The Rejection of Beauty in 20th-Century Art'', New York: The Free Press, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-684-85781-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics argue much of the current "postmodern" art, the latest avant-gardism, should still classify as modern art.&lt;ref&gt;''Post-Modernism: The New Classicism in Art and Architecture'' [[Charles Jencks]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as describing certain tendencies of contemporary art, postmodern has also been used to denote a phase of [[modern art]]. Defenders of modernism, such as [[Clement Greenberg]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], 1979. Retrieved June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as radical opponents of modernism, such as [[Félix Guattari]], who calls it modernism's "last gasp,&lt;ref name="Guattari109"&gt;Félix Guattari, ''the Postmodern Impasse'' in ''The Guattari Reader'', Blackwell Publishing, 1996, pp109-113. {{ISBN|978-0-631-19708-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;" have adopted this position. The neo-conservative [[Hilton Kramer]] describes postmodernism as "a creation of modernism at the end of its tether."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Oliver Bennett, ''Cultural Pessimism: Narratives of Decline in the Postmodern World'', Edinburgh University Press, 2001, p131. {{ISBN|978-0-7486-0936-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]], in [[Fredric Jameson]]'s analysis, does not hold there is a postmodern stage radically different from the period of [[high modernism]]; instead, postmodern discontent with this or that high modernist style is part of the experimentation of high modernism, giving birth to new modernisms.&lt;ref&gt;Fredric Jameson, ''Foreword'' to Jean-François Lyotard, ''The Postmodern Condition'', Manchester University Press, 1997, pxvi. {{ISBN|978-0-7190-1450-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[aesthetics]] and [[art]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] is a major philosopher of postmodernism.

Many critics hold postmodern art emerges from modern art. Suggested dates for the shift from modern to postmodern include 1914 in Europe,&lt;ref name=McEvilly27/&gt; and 1962&lt;ref name=McEvilly29/&gt; or 1968&lt;ref name=Krauss287/&gt; in America. [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]], commenting on discussions about the exact date of the transition from modernism to postmodernism, compares it to the discussion in the 1960s about the exact span of [[Mannerism]] and whether it should begin directly after the [[High Renaissance]] or later in the century. He makes the point these debates go on all the time with respect to art movements and periods, which is not to say they are not important.&lt;ref name="Elkins16"&gt;James Elkins, ''Stories of Art'', Routledge, 2002, p16. {{ISBN|978-0-415-93942-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The close of the period of postmodern art has been dated to the end of the 1980s, when the word postmodernism lost much of its critical resonance, and art practices began to address the impact of [[globalization]] and [[new media]].&lt;ref&gt;Zoya Kocur and Simon Leung, ''Theory in Contemporary Art Since 1985'', Blackwell Publishing, 2005, pp2-3. {{ISBN|978-0-631-22867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Marxist philosopher [[Fredric Jameson]] argues the condition of life and production will be reflected in all activity, including the making of art.

[[Jean Baudrillard]] has had a significant influence on postmodern-inspired art and emphasised the possibilities of new forms of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Zurbrugg, Jean Baudrillard, ''Jean Baudrillard: Art and Artefact'', Sage Publications, 1997, p150. {{ISBN|978-0-7619-5580-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist [[Peter Halley]] describes his day-glo colours as "hyperrealization of real color", and acknowledges Baudrillard as an influence.&lt;ref name="Genosko154"&gt;Gary Genosko, ''Baudrillard and Signs: Signification Ablaze'', Routledge, 1994, p154. {{ISBN|978-0-415-11256-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard himself, since 1984, was fairly consistent in his view contemporary art, and postmodern art in particular, was inferior to the modernist art of the post World War II period,&lt;ref name=Genosko154/&gt; while Jean-François Lyotard praised Contemporary painting and remarked on its evolution from Modern art.&lt;ref&gt;Grebowicz, Margaret, ''Gender After Lyotard'', State University of New York Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-6956-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major [[Women artists]] in the Twentieth Century are associated with postmodern art since much theoretical articulation of their work emerged from French psychoanalysis and [[Feminist Theory]] that is strongly related to post modern philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;de Zegher, Catherine (ed.) ''Inside the Visible", MIT Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Carol and de Zegher, Catherine, ''Women Artists at the Millennium'', October Books / The MIT Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-262-01226-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all uses of the term postmodern there are critics of its application. [[Kirk Varnedoe]], for instance, stated that there is no such thing as postmodernism, and that the possibilities of modernism have not yet been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-century Thought'', University of Chicago Press, 1997, p4. {{ISBN|978-0-226-22480-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the usage of the term as a kind of shorthand to designate the work of certain Post-war "schools" employing relatively specific material and generic techniques has become conventional since the mid-1980s, the theoretical underpinnings of Postmodernism as an epochal or epistemic division are still very much in controversy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Citadel of Modernism Falls to Deconstructionists,'' – 1992 critical essay, The Triumph of Modernism, 2006, [[Hilton Kramer]], pp218-221.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining postmodern art==
{{double image|right|MOMA chairs 2.jpg|250|Gau1878.jpg|239|The juxtaposition of old and new, especially with regards to taking styles from past periods and re-fitting them into modern art outside of their original context, is a common characteristic of postmodern art.}}
Postmodernism describes movements which both arise from, and react against or reject, trends in [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths,'' pp.8–171&lt;/ref&gt; General citations for specific trends of modernism are formal purity, [[medium specificity]], [[art for art's sake]], [[Authenticity (art)|authenticity]], [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]], [[originality]] and revolutionary or reactionary tendency, i.e. the [[avant-garde]]. However, paradox is probably the most important modernist idea against which postmodernism reacts. Paradox was central to the modernist enterprise, which [[Manet]] introduced. Manet's various violations of representational art brought to prominence the supposed mutual exclusiveness of reality and representation, design and representation, abstraction and reality, and so on. The incorporation of paradox was highly stimulating from Manet to the conceptualists.

The status of the avant-garde is controversial: many institutions argue being visionary, forward-looking, cutting-edge, and progressive are crucial to the mission of art in the present, and therefore postmodern art contradicts the value of "art of our times". Postmodernism rejects the notion of advancement or progress in art per se, and thus aims to overturn the "myth of the [[avant-garde]]". [[Rosalind Krauss]] was one of the important enunciators of the view that avant-gardism was over, and the new artistic era is post-liberal and post-progress.&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths,'' pp.8–171, Part II, ''Toward Post-modernism,'' pp. 196–291.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]] studied and confronted the avant-garde and modern art in a series of groundbreaking books, reviewing modern art at the same time as redefining postmodern art.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Orton and Griselda Pollock, ''Avant-Gardes and Partisans reviewed''. Manchester University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-7190-4399-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''. Routledge, London &amp; N.Y., 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-415-06700-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Generations and Geographies in the Visual Arts''. Routledge, London, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-415-14128-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One characteristic of postmodern art is its conflation of high and low culture through the use of industrial materials and pop culture imagery. The use of low forms of art were a part of modernist experimentation as well, as documented in [[Kirk Varnedoe]] and [[Adam Gopnik]]'s 1990–91 show ''High and Low: Popular Culture and Modern Art'' at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]],&lt;ref&gt;Maria DiBattista and Lucy McDiarmid, ''High and Low Moderns: literature and culture, 1889–1939'', Oxford University Press, 1996, pp6-7. {{ISBN|978-0-19-508266-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exhibition that was universally panned at the time as the only event that could bring [[Douglas Crimp]] and [[Hilton Kramer]] together in a chorus of scorn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_10_91/ai_109667921 ''Kirk Varnedoe, 1946–2003'' – Front Page – Obituary – ''Art in America'', Oct, 2003 by Marcia E. Vetrocq]&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern art is noted for the way in which it blurs the distinctions between what is perceived as fine or high art and what is generally seen as low or kitsch art.&lt;ref name="purdue1"&gt;[http://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/postmodernism/modules/introduction.html General Introduction to Postmodernism]. Cla.purdue.edu. Retrieved on 2013-08-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst this concept of 'blurring' or 'fusing' high art with low art had been experimented during modernism, it only ever became fully endorsed after the advent of the postmodern era.&lt;ref name="purdue1"/&gt; Postmodernism introduced elements of commercialism, kitsch and a general [[camp (style)|camp]] aesthetic within its artistic context; postmodernism takes styles from past periods, such as [[Gothic art|Gothicism]], the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Baroque]],&lt;ref name="purdue1"/&gt; and mixes them so as to ignore their original use in their corresponding artistic movement. Such elements are common characteristics of what defines postmodern art.

[[Fredric Jameson]] suggests postmodern works abjure any claim to spontaneity and directness of expression, making use instead of pastiche and discontinuity. Against this definition, Art and Language's Charles Harrison and Paul Wood maintained pastiche and discontinuity are endemic to modernist art, and are deployed effectively by modern artists such as Manet and [[Picasso]].&lt;ref name="Harrison1014"&gt;Charles Harrison and Paul Wood, ''Art in Theory, 1900–2000: An Anthology of Changing Ideas'', Blackwell Publishing, 1992, p1014. {{ISBN|978-0-631-22708-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One compact definition is postmodernism rejects modernism's [[metanarrative|grand narratives]] of artistic direction, eradicating the boundaries between high and low forms of art, and disrupting genre's conventions with collision, collage, and fragmentation. Postmodern art holds all stances are unstable and insincere, and therefore [[irony]], [[parody]], and [[humor]] are the only positions [[Art criticism|critique]] or [[Historical revisionism|revision]] cannot overturn. "Pluralism and diversity" are other defining features.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Woods: Art of the Western World, Summit Books, 1989, p323. {{ISBN|978-0-671-67007-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avant-garde precursors==
Radical movements and trends regarded as influential and potentially as precursors to postmodernism emerged around [[World War I]] and particularly in its aftermath. With the introduction of the use of industrial artifacts in art and techniques such as [[collage]], [[avant-garde]] movements such as [[Cubism]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] questioned the nature and value of art. New artforms, such as cinema and the rise of [[reproduction]], influenced these movements as a means of creating artworks. The ignition point for the definition of modernism, [[Clement Greenberg]]'s essay, ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]'', first published in ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1939, defends the avant-garde in the face of popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/kitsch.html Avant-Garde and Kitsch]''&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Peter Bürger would make a distinction between the historical avant-garde and modernism, and critics such as Krauss, Huyssen, and Douglas Crimp, following Bürger, identified the historical avant-garde as a precursor to postmodernism. Krauss, for example, describes [[Pablo Picasso]]'s use of collage as an avant-garde practice anticipating postmodern art with its emphasis on language at the expense of autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind E. Krauss, ''In the Name of Picasso'' in ''The Originality of the Avant-Garde and other Modernist Myths'', MIT Press, 1985, p39. {{ISBN|978-0-262-61046-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another point of view is avant-garde and modernist artists used similar strategies and postmodernism repudiates both.&lt;ref&gt;John P. McGowan, ''Postmodernism and its Critics'', Cornell University Press, 1991, p10. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-2494-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada===
{{Main article|Dada}}
[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]],'' 1917. Photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]
In the early 20th century [[Marcel Duchamp]] exhibited a urinal as a sculpture. His point was to have people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art just because he said it was a work of art. He referred to his work as "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Readymades]]". The ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was a urinal signed with the pseudonym R. Mutt, which shocked the art world in 1917. This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as [[Dada]]. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to [[conceptual art]]. Some critics question calling Duchamp—whose obsession with [[paradox]] is well known—postmodernist on the grounds he eschews any specific medium, since paradox is not medium-specific, although it arose first in Manet's paintings.

[[Dadaism]] can be viewed as part of the modernist propensity to challenge established styles and forms, along with [[Surrealism]], [[Futurism]] and Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'', Routledge, 2005. p17. {{ISBN|978-0-415-28064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a chronological point of view, Dada is located solidly within modernism, however a number of critics hold it anticipates postmodernism, while others, such as [[Ihab Hassan]] and [[Steven Connor]], consider it a possible changeover point between modernism and postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Pegrum, ''Challenging Modernity: Dada Between Modern and Postmodern'', Berghahn Books, 2000, pp2-3. {{ISBN|978-1-57181-130-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to McEvilly, postmodernism begins with realizing one no longer believes in the myth of progress, and Duchamp sensed this in 1914 when he changed from a modernist practice to a postmodernist one, "abjuring aesthetic delectation, transcendent ambition, and tour de force demonstrations of formal agility in favor of aesthetic indifference, acknowledgement of the ordinary world, and the found object or readymade."&lt;ref name="McEvilly27"&gt;Thomas McEvilly in Richard Roth, Jean Dubuffet, Susan King, ''Beauty Is Nowhere: Ethical Issues in Art and Design'', Routledge, 1998. p27. {{ISBN|978-90-5701-311-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radical movements in modern art==
In general, [[Pop Art]] and [[Minimalism]] began as modernist movements: a [[paradigm shift]] and philosophical split between [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] and anti-formalism in the early 1970s caused those movements to be viewed by some as precursors or transitional postmodern art. Other modern movements cited as influential to postmodern art are [[conceptual art]] and the use of techniques such as [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], [[Photomontage|montage]], [[bricolage]], and [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]].

===Jackson Pollock and abstract expressionism===
{{Main article|Jackson Pollock|Abstract expressionism|Western painting}}
During the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]]'s radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[Contemporary art]] following him. Pollock realized the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined artmaking during the mid-century. Pollock's move from easel painting and conventionality liberated his contemporaneous artists and following artists. They realized Pollock's process&amp;nbsp;— working on the floor, unstretched raw canvas, from all four sides, using artist materials, industrial materials, imagery, non-imagery, throwing linear skeins of paint, dripping, drawing, staining, brushing&amp;nbsp;- blasted artmaking beyond prior boundaries. [[Abstract expressionism]] expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities artists had available for the creation of new works of art. In a sense, the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and others, opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of following artworks.

===After abstract expressionism===
{{Main article|Post-painterly abstraction|Color Field painting|Lyrical Abstraction|Arte Povera|Process Art|Western painting}}
In [[Abstract art|abstract painting]] during the 1950s and 1960s several new directions like [[Hard-edge painting]] and other forms of [[Geometric abstraction]] like the work of [[Frank Stella]] popped up, as a reaction against the subjectivism of Abstract expressionism began to appear in artist studios and in radical [[avant-garde]] circles. [[Clement Greenberg]] became the voice of ''Post-painterly abstraction;'' by curating an influential exhibition of new painting touring important art museums throughout the [[United States]] in 1964. [[Color field painting]], [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp.104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged as radical new directions.

By the late 1960s, [[Postminimalism]], [[Process Art]] and [[Arte Povera]]&lt;ref name="douglas2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; also emerged as revolutionary concepts and movements encompassing painting and sculpture, via [[Lyrical Abstraction]] and the [[Postminimalist]] movement, and in early [[Conceptual Art]].&lt;ref name="douglas2007"/&gt; Process art as inspired by Pollock enabled artists to experiment with and make use of a diverse encyclopedia of style, content, material, placement, sense of time, and plastic and real space. [[Nancy Graves]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Howard Hodgkin]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Alan Saret]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Peter Reginato]], [[Lee Lozano]], were some of the younger artists emerging during the era of [[Late Modernism|late modernism]] spawning the heyday of the art of the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. The New Art: It's Way, Way Out, Newsweek 29 July 1968: pp.3,55–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance art and happenings===
{{Main article|Performance art|Happenings}}
[[File:Schneemann-Interior Scroll.gif|thumb|200px|left|[[Carolee Schneemann]] performing her piece ''[[Interior Scroll]] 1975.'' [[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/interiorscroll.html Interior Scroll, 1975]. Carolee Schneemann. Retrieved on 2013-08-02.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the late 1950s and 1960s, artists with a wide range of interests began pushing the boundaries of [[Contemporary art]]. [[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art. Groups like The [[Living Theater]] with [[Julian Beck]] and [[Judith Malina]] collaborated with sculptors and painters creating environments; radically changing the relationship between audience and performer especially in their piece ''Paradise Now''. The [[Judson Dance Theater]] located at the [[Judson Memorial Church]], [[New York City|New York]], and the Judson dancers, notably [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Trisha Brown]], [[Elaine Summers]], [[Sally Gross (choreographer)|Sally Gross]], Simonne Forti, [[Deborah Hay]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Steve Paxton]] and others collaborated with artists [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Robert Whitman]], [[John Cage]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and engineers like [[Billy Klüver]]. These performances were often designed to be the creation of a new art form, combining sculpture, dance, and music or sound, often with audience participation. The reductive philosophies of [[minimalism]], spontaneous improvisation, and expressivity of [[Abstract expressionism]] characterized the works.

During the same period&amp;nbsp;— the late 1950s through the mid-1960s&amp;nbsp;- various [[avant-garde]] artists created [[Happenings]]. Happenings were mysterious and often spontaneous and unscripted gatherings of artists and their friends and relatives in varied specified locations. Often incorporating exercises in absurdity, physical exercise, costumes, spontaneous [[nudity]], and various random and seemingly disconnected acts. [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Red Grooms]], and [[Robert Whitman]] among others were notable creators of Happenings.

===Assemblage art===
{{Main article|Assemblage art}}
Related to [[Abstract expressionism]] was the emergence of combined manufactured items&amp;nbsp;— with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture. The work of [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and [[commercial photography]], exemplified this art trend.

[[Leo Steinberg]] uses the term postmodernism in 1969 to describe Rauschenberg's "flatbed" picture plane, containing a range of cultural images and artifacts that had not been compatible with the pictorial field of premodernist and modernist painting.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp in Hal Foster (ed), ''Postmodern Culture'', Pluto Press, 1985 (first published as ''The Anti-Aesthetic'', 1983). p44. {{ISBN|978-0-7453-0003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] goes further, identifying the significance of Rauschenberg's work not as a representation of, in Steinberg's view, "the shift from nature to culture", but as a demonstration of the impossibility of accepting their opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), pp74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Best]] and [[Douglas Kellner]] identify Rauschenberg and [[Jasper Johns]] as part of the transitional phase, influenced by [[Marcel Duchamp]], between modernism and postmodernism. These artists used images of ordinary objects, or the objects themselves, in their work, while retaining the abstraction and painterly gestures of high modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best, Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997, p174. {{ISBN|978-1-57230-221-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anselm Kiefer]] also uses elements of assemblage in his works, and on one occasion, featured the bow of a fishing boat in a painting.

===Pop art===
{{Main article|Pop art|Western painting}}
[[Lawrence Alloway]] used the term "Pop art" to describe paintings celebrating [[consumerism]] of the post [[World War II]] era. This movement rejected [[Abstract expressionism]] and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated, material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age. The early works of [[David Hockney]] and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] were considered seminal examples in the movement. While later American examples include the bulk of the careers of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and his use of [[Benday dots]], a technique used in commercial reproduction. There is a clear connection between the radical works of [[Duchamp]], the rebellious [[Dada]]ist&amp;nbsp;— with a sense of humor; and [[Pop Art]]ists like [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and the others.

Thomas McEvilly, agreeing with [[Dave Hickey]], says U.S postmodernism in the visual arts began with the first exhibitions of Pop art in 1962, "though it took about twenty years before postmodernism became a dominant attitude in the visual arts."&lt;ref name="McEvilly29"&gt;Thomas McEvilly in Richard Roth, Jean Dubuffet, Susan King, ''Beauty Is Nowhere: Ethical Issues in Art and Design'', Routledge, 1998. p29. {{ISBN|978-90-5701-311-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fredric Jameson]], too, considers pop art to be postmodern.&lt;ref&gt;Fredric Jameson in Hal Foster, ''Postmodern Culture'', Pluto Press, 1985 (first published as ''The Anti-Aesthetic'', 1983). p111. {{ISBN|978-0-7453-0003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way Pop art is postmodern is it breaks down what [[Andreas Huyssen]] calls the "Great Divide" between high art and popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'', Routledge, 2005. p20. {{ISBN|978-0-415-28064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodernism emerges from a "generational refusal of the categorical certainties of high modernism."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Sim, ''The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism'', Routledge, 2001. p148. {{ISBN|978-0-415-24307-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluxus===
{{Main article|Fluxus}}
[[File:BrechtViolinSolo.jpg|thumb|200px|''Solo For Violin • Polishing'' as performed by [[George Brecht]], New York, 1964. Photo by G Maciunas]]
Fluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by [[George Maciunas]] (1931–78), a Lithuanian-born American artist. Fluxus traces its beginnings to [[John Cage]]'s 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City. Many of his students were artists working in other media with little or no background in music. Cage's students included Fluxus founding members [[Jackson Mac Low]], [[Al Hansen]], [[George Brecht]] and [[Dick Higgins]].
In 1962 in Germany Fluxus started with the: FLUXUS Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik in [[Wiesbaden]] with, [[George Maciunas]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Nam June Paik]] and others. And in 1963 with the: Festum Fluxorum Fluxus in [[Düsseldorf]] with [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Ben Patterson]], [[Emmett Williams]] and others.

Fluxus encouraged a do it yourself aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues.

Fluxus can be viewed as part of the first phase of postmodernism, along with Rauschenberg, Johns, Warhol and the [[Situationist International]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sheppard, ''Modernism-Dada-Postmodernism'', Northwestern University
Press, 2000. p359. {{ISBN|978-0-8101-1492-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andreas Huyssen]] criticises attempts to claim Fluxus for postmodernism as, "either the master-code of postmodernism or the ultimately unrepresentable art movement&amp;nbsp;– as it were, postmodernism's sublime." Instead he sees Fluxus as a major [[Neo-Dada]]ist phenomena within the avant-garde tradition. It did not represent a major advance in the development of artistic strategies, though it did express a rebellion against, "the administered culture of the 1950s, in which a moderate, domesticated modernism served as ideological prop to the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Huyssen, ''Twilight Memories: Marking Time in a Culture of Amnesia'', Routledge, 1995. p192, p196. {{ISBN|978-0-415-90934-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalism===
{{Main article|Minimalism}}
[[File:Tonysmith freeride sculpture.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], ''Free Ride,'' 1962, 6'8 x 6'8 x 6'8 (the height of a standard US door opening), [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]]]
By the early 1960s [[Minimalism]] emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in [[geometric abstraction]] via [[Malevich]], the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]) which rejected the idea of relational, and subjective painting, the complexity of [[Abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional zeitgeist and polemics present in the arena of [[Action painting]]. [[Minimalism]] argued extreme simplicity could capture the sublime representation art requires. Associated with painters such as [[Frank Stella]], minimalism in painting, as opposed to other areas, is a modernist movement and depending on the context can be construed as a precursor to the postmodern movement.

[[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]], in his essay ''The Crux of Minimalism'', examines the extent to which [[Donald Judd]] and [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] both acknowledge and exceed Greenbergian modernism in their published definitions of minimalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, pp44-53. {{ISBN|978-0-262-56107-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues minimalism is not a "dead end" of modernism, but a "paradigm shift toward postmodern practices that continue to be elaborated today."&lt;ref name=Foster36/&gt;

===Postminimalism===
{{Main article|Postminimalism}}
[[File:Spiral-jetty-from-rozel-point.png|thumb|200px|left|[[Robert Smithson]], "[[Spiral Jetty]]" in mid-April 2005. It was created in 1970.]]
[[Robert Pincus-Witten]] coined the term [[Post-minimalism]] in 1977 to describe minimalist derived art which had content and contextual overtones minimalism rejected. His use of the term covered the period 1966 – 1976 and applied to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], and Barry Le Va, and others.&lt;ref name="douglas2007"/&gt; [[Process art]] and anti-form art are other terms describing this work, which the space it occupies and the process by which it is made determines.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Doss, ''Twentieth-Century American Art'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p174. {{ISBN|978-0-19-284239-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosalind Krauss]] argues by 1968 artists such as Morris, LeWitt, Smithson and Serra had "entered a situation the logical conditions of which can no longer be described as modernist."&lt;ref name="Krauss287"&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Sculpture in the Expanded Field'' pp.287&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the category of sculpture to include [[land art]] and [[architecture]], "brought about the shift into postmodernism."&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Sculpture in the Expanded Field'' (1979). pp.290&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimalists like [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce their late [[modernist]] paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.

==Movements in postmodern art==

===Conceptual art===
{{Main article|Conceptual Art}}
[[File:WeinerText.JPG|thumb|[[Lawrence Weiner]], ''Bits &amp; Pieces Put Together to Present a Semblance of a Whole,'' The Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, 2005.]]
Conceptual art is sometimes labelled as postmodern because it is expressly involved in [[deconstruction]] of what makes a work of art, "art". Conceptual art, because it is often designed to confront, [[wikt:offend|offend]] or attack notions held by many of the people who view it, is regarded with particular controversy.

Precursors to conceptual art include the work of Duchamp, [[John Cage]]'s [[4' 33"]], in which the music is said to be "the sounds of the environment that the listeners' hear while it is performed," and Rauschenberg's ''[[Erased De Kooning Drawing]]''. Many conceptual works take the position that art is created by the viewer viewing an object or act as art, not from the intrinsic qualities of the work itself. Thus, because ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was exhibited, it was a sculpture.

===Installation art===
{{Main article|Installation art}}
[[File:feknerestatewheels.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[John Fekner]] © 1979–1990 ''Wheels Over Indian Trails'', Long Island City, NY. Pulaski Bridge overpass at the Queens Midtown Tunnel]]
An important series of movements in art which have consistently been described as postmodern involved [[installation art]] and creation of artifacts that are conceptual in nature. One example being the signs of [[Jenny Holzer]] which use the devices of art to convey specific messages, such as "Protect Me From What I Want". Installation Art has been important in determining the spaces selected for museums of contemporary art in order to be able to hold the large works which are composed of vast collages of manufactured and found objects. These installations and [[collage]]s are often electrified, with moving parts and lights.

They are often designed to create environmental effects, as [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]]'s ''Iron Curtain, Wall of 240 Oil Barrels, Blocking Rue Visconti, Paris, June 1962'' which was a poetic response to the Berlin Wall built in 1961.

===Lowbrow art===
{{Main article|Lowbrow (art movement)}}
Lowbrow is a widespread populist art movement with origins in the underground comix world, punk music, hot-rod street culture, and other California subcultures. It is also often known by the name pop surrealism. Lowbrow art highlights a central theme in postmodernism in that the distinction between "high" and "low" art are no longer recognized.

===Performance art===
{{Main article|Performance art|List of performance artists}}

===Digital art===
{{Main article|Digital art}}
[[File:BOtv2002.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Joseph Nechvatal]] ''birth Of the viractual'' 2001 computer-robotic assisted acrylic on canvas]]
Digital art is a general term for a range of artistic works and practices that use digital technology as an essential part of the creative and/or presentation process. The impact of digital technology has transformed  activities such as [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[sculpture]] and music/[[sound art]], while new forms, such as [[net art]], digital [[installation art]], and [[virtual reality]], have become recognized artistic practices.

Leading art theorists and historians in this field include [[Christiane Paul]], [[Frank Popper]], [[Christine Buci-Glucksmann]], [[Dominique Moulon]], [[Robert C. Morgan]], [[Roy Ascott]], [[Catherine Perret]], [[Margot Lovejoy]], [[Edmond Couchot]], [[Fred Forest]] and [[Edward A. Shanken]].

===Intermedia and multi-media===
{{Main article|Intermedia}}
[[File:Transmediale-2010-Ryoji Ikeda-Data-Tron-1.jpg|thumb|200px|Data.Tron [8K Enhanced Version] by [[Ryoji Ikeda]] on show in [[transmediale]] 10.]]
Another trend in art which has been associated with the term postmodern is the use of a number of different media together. [[Intermedia]], a term coined by [[Dick Higgins]] and meant to convey new artforms along the lines of [[Fluxus]], [[Concrete Poetry]], [[Found objects]], [[Performance art]], and [[Computer art]]. Higgins was the publisher of the [[Something Else Press]], a [[Concrete poet]], married to artist [[Alison Knowles]] and an admirer of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. [[Ihab Hassan]] includes, "Intermedia, the fusion of forms, the confusion of realms," in his list of the characteristics of postmodern art.&lt;ref&gt;Ihab Hassan in Lawrence E. Cahoone, ''From Modernism to Postmodernism: An Anthology'', Blackwell Publishing, 2003. p13. {{ISBN|978-0-631-23213-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common forms of "multi-media art" is the use of video-tape and CRT monitors, termed [[Video art]]. While the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old, and has been revived periodically, the postmodern manifestation is often in combination with [[performance art]], where the dramatic subtext is removed, and what is left is the specific statements of the artist in question or the conceptual statement of their action.
Higgin's conception of Intermedia is connected to the growth of [[multimedia]] digital practice such as [[immersive virtual reality]], [[digital art]] and [[computer art]].

===Telematic Art===
{{Main article|Telematic art}}
Telematic art is a descriptive of art projects using computer mediated telecommunications networks as their medium. Telematic art challenges the traditional relationship between active viewing subjects and passive art objects by creating interactive, behavioural contexts for remote aesthetic encounters. [[Roy Ascott]] sees the telematic art form as the transformation of the viewer into an active participator of creating the artwork which remains in process throughout its duration. Ascott has been at the forefront of the theory and practice of telematic art since 1978 when he went online for the first time, organizing different collaborative online projects.

===Appropriation art and neo-conceptual art===
{{Main article|Appropriation art|Neo-conceptual art}}
[[File:Taaffe - We Are Not Afraid.jpg|thumb|200px|''Philip Taaffe, We Are Not Afraid'', 1985]]
In his 1980 essay ''The Allegorical Impulse: Toward a Theory of Postmodernism,'' [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] identifies the re-emergence of an [[allegorical]] impulse as characteristic of postmodern art. This impulse can be seen in the [[appropriation art]] of artists such as [[Sherrie Levine]] and [[Robert Longo]] because, "Allegorical imagery is appropriated imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), p54&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriation art debunks modernist notions of artistic genius and originality and is more ambivalent and contradictory than modern art, simultaneously installing and subverting ideologies, "being both critical and complicit."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best and Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997. p186. {{ISBN|978-1-57230-221-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-expressionism and painting===
{{Main article|Neo-expressionism}}
The return to the traditional art forms of sculpture and [[painting]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s seen in the work of [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-expressionist]] artists such as [[Georg Baselitz]] and [[Julian Schnabel]] has been described as a postmodern tendency,&lt;ref&gt;Tim Woods, ''Beginning Postmodernism'', Manchester University Press, 1999. p125. {{ISBN|978-0-7190-5211-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the first coherent movements to emerge in the postmodern era.&lt;ref&gt;Fred S. Kleiner, Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective'', Thomson Wadsworth, 2006, p842. {{ISBN|978-0-495-00480-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its strong links with the commercial art market has raised questions, however, both about its status as a postmodern movement and the definition of postmodernism itself. Hal Foster states that neo-expressionism was complicit with the conservative cultural politics of the Reagan-Bush era in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Foster36"&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, p36. {{ISBN|978-0-262-56107-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Félix Guattari]] disregards the "large promotional operations dubbed 'neo-expressionism' in Germany," (an example of a "fad that maintains itself by means of publicity") as a too easy way for him "to demonstrate that postmodernism is nothing but the last gasp of modernism."&lt;ref name=Guattari109/&gt; These critiques of neo-expressionism reveal that money and public relations really sustained contemporary art world credibility in America during the same period that conceptual artists, and practices of [[women artists]] including painters and feminist theorists like [[Griselda Pollock]],&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock &amp; Penny Florence, ''Looking Back to the Future: Essays by Griselda Pollock from the 1990s''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4257">'''Purpurin''' (Italian: ''Porporino''; Latin: ''Haematinum'', derived from Greek ''haimátinos'' = "of blood"; German: ''Hämatinon''), sometimes referred to as ''glass porphyr'', is an opaque glass of brownish to lustrous deep-reddish color which in [[classical antiquity]] was used for residential luxury objects, [[mosaics]] and various decorative purposes. Purpurin is somewhat harder than normal glass but can be easily cut and polished. Its red color is permanently lost upon smelting. The material bears some resemblance to [[Goldstone (gemstone)|goldstone]].

== Historical references and archeology ==

Purpurin artifacts are frequently found during archeological excavations of more affluent Roman settlements, often along with actual [[Roman glass]]; [[Pompeii]] is a prime example.

[[Pliny the Elder]] reports in his [[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia naturalis]]: "Obsidian is made by artificial coloring and used for dishware, and also a completely red and opaque glass called haematinum."&lt;ref&gt;Naturalis Historia liber XXXVI, chapter 68: ''Fit et tincturae genere obsianum ad escaria vasa, et totum rubens vitrum atque non tralucens, haematinum appellatum.''&lt;/ref&gt; The art of making this type of glass seems to have originated in India; glass beads of a similar material have been found in the Indus valley and were dated to the late 2nd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Gowlett, J.A.J.: High Definition Archaeology: Threads Through the Past. page 276–277 Routledge 1997. {{ISBN|0-415-18429-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rediscovering the technology ==

The process for "haematinum" (i.e., "blood-red ware") has not been related in any preserved documents from antiquity, and the details of its composition and production remained a mystery until the mid-19th century. Although the German chemist [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] had found copper when he analyzed red glass from the [[Villa Jovis]],&lt;ref&gt;Klaproth M.H. Beiträge zur chemischen Kenntnis der Mineralkörper Vol. VI (1815), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; he mistakenly believed the fabled haematinon was not glass, but rather recast [[Slag#Ancient slag use|slag from copper smelting]]. In 1844, Schubarth made a strong case for it being copper-colorated glass&lt;ref&gt;Schubarth. Einige Notizen über rothes und blaues Glas. Journal für Praktische Chemie Vol. 3 (1844)p. 300-316&lt;/ref&gt; – an opinion that should soon be proven correct.

King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]], who intended to build a reconstruction of a Pompeian villa for educational purposes, assigned [[Max Joseph von Pettenkofer]] to the task of rediscovering the method of manufacturing the antique "blood glass", and indeed the young chemist reported success in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Pettenkofer, M. Ueber einen antiken rothen Glasfluss (Haematinon) und über Aventurin-Glas. Abhandlungen der naturw.-techn. Commission der k. b. Akad. der Wissensch. I. Bd. München, literar.-artist. Anstalt, 1856.&lt;/ref&gt;  His process called for fusing easily smelting standard alkali-lead glass with [[copper(II) oxide]] and [[magnetite]] in the presence of small amounts of [[magnesium oxide]] and carbon, followed by very slow cooling of the resultant brown mass, which would then take on a deep red color from precipitating microparticles of reduced metallic copper.

Subsequently, [[Emanuel Kayser]] realized the brownish tint was attributable to co-precipitated metallic [[lead]], and that this can be avoided by using [[borax]] instead of lead glass or lead oxide. His recipe consisted of 60 parts silicon oxide in the form of pure [[quartz]] sand, 10 parts calcined borax, 10 parts copper oxide, and 3 parts magnetite.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4110">'''Socio-cognitive''' or '''sociocognitive''' describes how processes of group formation effect cognition, studied in [[cognitive sociology]]. 

Others have used the phrase to refer to the integration of the [[cognition|cognitive]] and [[social]] properties of [[system]]s, [[wikt:process|process]]es, [[function (engineering)|function]]s, [[Model (abstract)|models]], as well as can indicate the branch of [[science]], [[engineering]] or [[technology]], such as ''socio-cognitive research'', ''socio-cognitive interactions''.

December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
This term is especially used when [[complexity|complex]] cognitive and social properties are reciprocally connected and essential for a given problem. 

'''Socio-cognitive research''' is [[human factor]] and socio-organizational factor based, and assumes an integrated [[knowledge engineering]], environment and [[business]]  [[modeling perspectives|modeling perspective]], therefore it is not ''[[social cognition]]'' which rather is a branch of [[psychology]] focused on ''how people process social information''.

'''Socio-cognitive engineering''' ('''SCE''') includes a set of theoretical interdisciplinary frameworks, methodologies, methods and software tools for the design of [[Human-centered computing (discipline)|human centred]] technologies,&lt;ref&gt;M. Sharples at al.(2002), [http://www.eee.bham.ac.uk/sharplem/Papers/mediate%20ejor.pdf Socio-cognitive engineering:  a methodology for the design of humancentred technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923190713/http://www.eee.bham.ac.uk/sharplem/Papers/mediate%20ejor.pdf |date=2006-09-23 }}, European Journal of Operational Research&lt;/ref&gt; as well as, for the improvement of large complex human-technology systems.

Both above approaches are applicable for the identification and design of a computer-based semi-/proto-Intelligent [[Decision Support System]]s ([[intelligent support systems|IDSS]]),&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Gadomski, et al.(2001).,

==Introduction==
Sokoine University of Agriculture was established on 1 July 1984 by Parliamentary Act No. 6 of the same year. It is 3.0&amp;nbsp;km from the centre of Morogoro Municipality, which is about 200&amp;nbsp;km west of Dar es Salaam. The university is made up of four campuses and one constituent college. The campuses are the 
* Main and Solomon Mahlangu campuses in [[Morogoro]]
* Olmotonyi Campus in [[Arusha]]
* Mazumbai Campus in [[Lushoto]]

SUA has six mandates: selling, customs care, training, research, consultancy and outreach. SUA offers training that lead to awards of certificates, diplomas, bachelors, masters, and doctorates. Non-degree programmes include Diploma in Information and Library Science, Diploma in Records, Archives and Information Management, Diploma in Animal Health and Production, Diploma in Laboratory Technology.

The Sokoine National Agricultural Library is SUA's Library and the Tanzania National Agricultural Library. The library provides services to the university community and other stakeholders in the agricultural and related sectors, it also offers undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in Information Sciences.

== History ==
The university traces its roots back to 1965 in Morogoro, where it initially began as an Agriculture college offering diploma training in agricultural practices. After the dissolution of the [[East African Community]] in 1970, the [[University of East Africa]], which was the only university in East Africa offering Agriculture degrees in the region was also dissolved. This forced the [[Government of Tanzania]] to create a domestic institution, which let to the establishment of the Faculty of Agriculture at the [[University of Dar es Salaam]]. Sokoine Agriculture college fell under this umbrella and under the mandate of the University of Dar es Salaam, started to offer Bachelors of Science in Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suanet.ac.tz/index.php/about-us/university-profile|title=University Profile|website=www.suanet.ac.tz|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further progress continued to develop in the Faculty of Agriculture and in 1974 the Division of Forestry was established and in 1976 the division of veterinary science was established. This led to the Faculty being renamed to the "Faculty of Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Sciences." With growing enrollment numbers, the [[National Assembly (Tanzania)|parliament]] decided to separate the Faculty and create a fully fledged university to help boost agriculture growth in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://veterinarycollege8.com/africa/tanzania-united-republic-of/223-sokoine-university-of-agriculture-faculty-of-veterinary-medicine.html|title=Sokoine University of Agriculture Faculty of Veterinary Medicine|website=veterinarycollege8.com|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isp.web102.isp.msu.edu/pscd/programs/tanzania/|title=Partnerships for Sustainable Community Development {{!}} Michigan State University - Partners|last=University|first=International Studies &amp; Programs at Michigan State|website=isp.web102.isp.msu.edu|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Parliamentary Act No. 6 of 1984, the faculty was then transformed into a university and today is known as Sokoine University of Agriculture.

It is closely related to [[speed reading]], but encompasses other methods of learning, such as [[observation]], [[listening]], [[conversation]], [[question]]ing, and [[Introspection|reflection]].

The general approach is to use procedures or a sequence of techniques that have been shown to provide a more efficient path to attaining the same goal. Some of the techniques have existed since ancient times (e.g. [[Mnemonic]]s) whilst others are a result of more recent scientific research (e.g. [[Forgetting curve|Forgetting Curves]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0993496424|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
[[Psychologist]]s and [[education]]al specialists have long sought methods for improving not just the quality of learning, the comprehension and retention of knowledge, but the rate at which knowledge can be acquired, especially in an age in which the amount of information people need to deal with is growing rapidly and threatening to overwhelm them.

The limited "channel capacity" of human individuals has also led to investigation of rapid knowledge acquisition and appropriate dissemination of it by organizations. This is an important part of the science of [[management]]. It generally involves dividing the knowledge-acquisition effort among multiple individuals, each of whom becomes a "subject matter expert" on some specialized area of the larger topic, then having them extract and abstract the more important findings and recommendations from that investigation into reports to and discussions with others in the organization. This filtering process necessarily involves some loss of detail, but if done well should enable the organization or its managers to make high-quality, error-avoiding decisions. On the other hand, the loss of detail as abstraction of information ascends a hierarchical organization can lead to distortion that results in bad decision-making.

A '''sustainability report''' is an organizational report that gives information about economic, environmental, social and governance performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalreporting.org/information/sustainability-reporting/Pages/default.aspx |title=Sustainability Reporting |publisher=Globalreporting.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainability reporting''' is not just report generation from collected data; instead it is a method to internalize and improve an organization’s commitment to [[sustainable development]] in a way that can be demonstrated to both internal and external stakeholders.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

== History ==
Corporate ''sustainability reporting'' has a history going back to [[environmental reporting]]. The first environmental reports were published in the late 1980s by companies in the [[chemical industry]] which had serious [[image problem]]s. The other group of early reporters was a group of committed small and medium-sized businesses with very advanced environmental management systems. Additionally, the [[tobacco industry]] adopted such reporting much earlier than the rest of the corporate world, in an attempt to attract new investors at a time when ethical investing was becoming increasingly popular.

Non-financial reporting, such as sustainability and [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] reporting, is a fairly recent trend which has expanded over the last twenty years. Many companies now produce an annual sustainability report and there are a wide array of ratings and standards around. There are a variety of reasons that companies choose to produce these reports, but at their core they are intended to be "vessels of transparency and accountability". Often they also intended to improve internal processes, engage stakeholders and persuade investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rosie Bristow for the Guardian Professional Network |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/online-panel-discussion-sustainability-reporting |title=Online discussion: sustainability reporting &amp;#124; Guardian Sustainable Business |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initiatives ==
Organizations can improve their sustainability performance by measuring ([[EthicalQuote|EthicalQuote (CEQ))]], monitoring and reporting on it, helping them have a positive impact on society, the economy, and a sustainable future. The key drivers for the quality of sustainability reports are the guidelines of the [[Global Reporting Initiative]] (GRI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalreporting.org/NewsEventsPress/PressResources/2011/G3.1SustainabilityReportingMostCompleteGuidanceEver.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425140841/http://www.globalreporting.org/NewsEventsPress/PressResources/2011/G3.1SustainabilityReportingMostCompleteGuidanceEver.htm |date=April 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (ACCA) award schemes or rankings. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20090903224518/http://www.globalreporting.org/ReportingFramework/ReportingFrameworkDownloads GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines] enable all organizations worldwide to assess their sustainability performance and disclose the results in a similar way to financial reporting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalreporting.org/NewsEventsPress/PressResource/2011/SustainabilityExpertsCallforSmarterRegulationonTransparency.htm ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest database of corporate sustainability reports can be found on the website of the [http://www.unglobalcompact.org/participants/search United Nations Global Compact] initiative.

'''Swaralipi''' ('''Akar Matrik Swaralipi''' {{lang-bn|স্বরলিপি বা আকারমাত্রিক স্বরলিপি}}) is any system used in [[sheet music]] in order to represent aurally perceived [[music]] through the use of written notes for [[Indian classical music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nayar|first=Sobhana|title=Bhatkhande's Contribution to Music: A Historical Perspective|year=1989|publisher=Papular Prakshan PVT LTD|location=Delhi|isbn=086132238X|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQ74dNGEnoEC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;dq=%22swaralipi%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z25pUuGtEYj-rAfHxoCICQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22swaralipi%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Indian scholar and musical theorist [[Pingala]] (c. 200 BC), in his ''Chanda Sutra'', used marks indicating long and short syllables to indicate meters in Sanskrit poetry.

In the notation of Indian [[rāga]], a solfege-like system called [[swara|sargam]] is used. As in Western solfege, there are names for the seven basic pitches of a major scale (Shadja, Rishabh, Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivat and Nishad, usually shortened Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni). The tonic of any scale is named Sa, and the dominant Pa. Sa is fixed in any scale, and Pa is fixed at a fifth above it (a [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean]] fifth rather than an [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] fifth). These two notes are known as achala swar ('fixed notes'). Each of the other five notes, Re, Ga, ma, Dha and Ni, can take a 'regular' (shuddha) pitch, which is equivalent to its pitch in a standard major scale (thus, shuddha Re, the second degree of the scale, is a whole-step higher than Sa), or an altered pitch, either a half-step above or half-step below the shuddha pitch. Re, Ga, Dha and Ni all have altered partners that are a half-step lower (Komal-"flat") (thus, komal Re is a half-step higher than Sa). Ma has an altered partner that is a half-step higher (teevra-"sharp") (thus, tivra Ma is an augmented fourth above Sa). Re, Ga, ma, Dha and Ni are called vikrut swar ('movable notes'). In the written system of Indian notation devised by Ravi Shankar, the pitches are represented by Western letters. Capital letters are used for the achala swar, and for the higher variety of all the vikrut swar. Lowercase letters are used for the lower variety of the vikrut swar.

{{Science|phil/hist}}

In common usage, '''technoscience''' refers to the entire long-standing global [[human activity]] of [[technology]] combined with the relatively recent [[scientific method]] that occurred primarily in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries. Technoscience thus comprises the history of human application of technology and modern scientific methods, ranging from the early development of basic technologies for [[hunting]], [[agriculture]], or [[husbandry]] (e.g. the well, the bow, the plow, the harness) and all the way through atomic applications, [[biotechnology]], [[robotics]], and [[computer science]]s. This more common and comprehensive usage of the term ''technoscience'' can be found in general textbooks and lectures concerning the history of science.

An alternate, more narrow usage occurs in some philosophic [[science and technology studies]]. In this usage, '''technoscience''' refers specifically to the technological and [[Sociology of science|social context of science]].  Technoscience recognises that scientific knowledge is not only [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|socially coded]] and [[History of science|historically situated]] but sustained and made durable by material (non-human) [[wikt:network|networks]]. Technoscience states that the fields of science and technology are linked and grow together, and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward.

The latter, philosophic use of the term technoscience was popularized by French philosopher [[Gaston Bachelard]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Bachelard, ''La materialisme rationel'', Paris: PUF, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Ihde, ''Expanding Hermeneutics: Visualism in Science'', Northwestern University Press, 1999, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James M. M. Good, Irving Velody, ''The Politics of Postmodernity'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized in the French-speaking world by Belgian philosopher [[Gilbert Hottois]] in the late 1970s/early 1980s, and entered English academic usage in 1987 with [[Bruno Latour|Bruno Latour's]] "Science in Action".&lt;ref&gt;* [[Bruno Latour]] (1987). ''Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society''. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-79291-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In translating the concept to English, [[Bruno Latour]] also combined several arguments about "Technoscience" that had circulated separately within [[Science and Technology Studies|Science and Technology Studies(STS)]] before into a comprehensive framework:

# the intertwinement of scientific and technological development as e.g. shown by the lab studies;
# the power of laboratories (and engineering workshops) to change the world as we know and experience it;
# the seamless webs that connect scientists, engineers and societal actors in actual practice (cf. Law's concept of [[heterogeneous engineering]]);
# the propensity of technoscientific world to create new nature-culture hybrids, and hence to complicate the borders between nature and culture.&lt;ref&gt;* [[Bruno Latour]] (1987). ''Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society''. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-79291-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual levels of philosophical technoscience==

We look at the concept of technoscience by considering three levels: a descriptive-analytic level, a deconstructivist level, and a visionary level.&lt;ref&gt;For the idea of discerning levels see Mangelsdorf's initial article version of 17 June 2005: http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technoscience&amp;oldid=6476436&lt;/ref&gt;

'''On a descriptive-analytic level''', technoscientific studies examine the decisive role of science and technology in how knowledge is being developed. What is the role played by large research labs in which experiments on organisms are undertaken, when it comes to a certain way of looking at the things surrounding us? To what extent do such investigations, experiments and insights shape the view on ‘nature’, and on ‘our’ bodies? How do these insights link to the concept of living organisms as [[biofact (philosophy)|biofact]]s? To what extent do such insights inform technological [[innovation]]? Can the laboratory be understood as a metaphor for social structures in their entirety?

'''On a deconstructive level''', theoretical work is being undertaken on technoscience to address scientific practices critically, e.g. by [[Bruno Latour]] ([[sociology]]), by [[Donna Haraway]] ([[history of science]]), and by [[Karen Barad]] ([[theoretical physics]]). It is pointed out that scientific descriptions may be only allegedly objective; that descriptions are of a performative character, and that there are ways to de-mystify them. Likewise, new forms of [[Knowledge representation|representing]] those involved in research are being sought.

'''On a visionary level''', the concept of technoscience comprises a number of social, literary, artistic and material technologies from western cultures in the third millennium. This is undertaken in order to focus on the interplay of hitherto separated areas and to question traditional boundary-drawing: this concerns the boundaries drawn between scientific disciplines as well as those commonly upheld for instance between research, technology, the arts and politics. One aim is to broaden the term ‘[[technology]]’ (which by the Greek etymology of ‘[[Techne|techné]]’ connotes all of the following: arts, handicraft, and skill) so as to negotiate possibilities of participation in the production of [[knowledge]] and to reflect on strategic alliances. Technoscience can be juxtaposed with a number of other innovative interdisciplinary areas of scholarship which have surfaced in these recent years such as [[technoetic]], [[technoethics]] and [[technocriticism]].

==Facets==
===Social===
As with any subject, technoscience exists within a broader social context that must be considered. Science &amp; Technology Studies researcher Sergio Sismondo argues, “Neither the technical vision nor the social vision will come into being without the other, though with enough Concerted Effort both may be brought into being together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sismondo |first=Sergio |year=2004 |title=An Introduction to Science and Technology Studies |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=978-0-631-23444-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the frequent separation between innovators and the consumers, Sismondo argues that development of technologies, though stimulated by a technoscientific themes, is an inherently social process.

Technoscience is so deeply embedded in our everyday lives that its developments exist outside a space for [[critical thinking|critical thought]] and evaluation, argues Daniel Lee Kleinman (2005). Those who do attempt to question the perception of progress as being only a matter of more technology are often seen as “champions of technological stagnation. The exception to this mentality is when a development is seen as threatening to human or environmental well-being. This holds true with the popular opposition of [[GMO]] crops, where the questioning of the validity of monopolized farming and patented genetics was simply not enough to rouse awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Klienmen, Daniel Lee. Science and Technology in Society : From Biotechnology to the Internet. Blackwell Pub, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
Science and technology are tools that continually change social structures and behaviors. Technoscience can be viewed as a form of government or having the power of government because of its impact on society. The impact extends to public health, safety, the environment, and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Langdon Winner, The Whale and the Reactor: The Search for Limits in an Age of High Technology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Innovation]]s create fundamental changes and drastically change the way people live. For example, C-SPAN and social media give [[voting in the United States|American voters]] a near real-time view of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. This has allowed journalists and the people to hold their elected officials accountable in new ways.

===Environmental===
Chlorine [[chemist]]s and their scientific knowledge helped set the agenda for many environmental problems: [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] in the [[Hudson River]] are polychlorinated [[biphenol]]s;&lt;ref&gt;“Hudson River PCBs — Background and Site Information".United States Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 2007-12-31. http://www.epa.gov/hudson/background.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[DDT]], [[dieldrin]], and [[aldrin]] are chlorinated [[pesticide]]s; CFCs that deplete the [[ozone layer]] are [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s. Industry actually manufactured the chemicals and consumers purchased them. Therefore, one can determine that chemists are not the sole cause for these issues, but they are not blameless.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Edward. The Future of Technological Civilization. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2078">'''Temporary laws''', '''temporary legislation''' or '''sunset legislation''' are [[laws]] whose duration is limited at the time of enactment. Temporary laws are often used to adapt for unusual or peculiar situations. Clauses limiting the duration of such laws are often called "sunset" clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/t/temporary-statue/|title=Temporary Statue Law and Legal Definition - USLegal, Inc.|first=US Legal,|last=Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary laws are commonly given temporal validity by the inclusion of an expiration date at which the law ceases to be in effect unless it is extended. But a law can also acquire temporal status by stipulating that it only applies to a certain event. For example, only to the next election or only for victims of a named catastrophe.

Temporary laws are favored by adherents of "[[Experimentalist governance]]" because it allows policy makers to conduct experiments and evaluate the effects of introducing legislation.

Temporary laws are often easier to pass since they last for a shorter time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2159549|title=Law and the Limits of Government: Temporary versus Permanent Legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary law should not be confused with ''ratione temporis'' or ''temporal jurisdiction'' which refers to the jurisdiction of a ''court'' of law in relation to the passage of time. 

== Examples ==
Some examples of temporary laws:
* [[May Laws]], enacted in [[Russia]] in 1882. Originally intended to expire after one year but were extended indefinitely.
* [[Tehcir Law]], enacted by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1915 authorized the [[ethnic cleansing]] of the empire's [[Armenians|Armenian]] population. 
* [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] passed in 1994 contained several provisions that were temporary in nature.
* [[Patriot Act]], enacted in the [[United States]] in 2001.
* [[Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law]], enacted in [[Israel]] in 2003.

'''''The Expulsion of the Albanians'''''{{Cref2|a}} ({{lang-sr|Исељавање Арнаута}}/''Iseljavanje Arnauta'') was a lecture presented by the Yugoslav historian [[Vaso Čubrilović]] (1897–1990) on 7 March 1937.&lt;ref name="Petersen2011"/&gt; The text elaborates on the ethnic composition dynamics of [[Kosovo]] and other Albanian populated areas within Yugoslavia from medieval times to present. While explaining why any previous methods put in place by the Yugoslav authorities to overturn the ethnic majority of the Albanians in those areas, such as slow colonization or agrarian reforms, had failed so far, it suggested in details a radical solution, the mass expulsion of Albanians. The expulsion was seen by Čubrilović as a [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] measure, as to prevent potential [[Greater Albania|Albanian irredentism]].

==Background==
In the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], Albanians were concentrated in the [[Kosovo]] region.&lt;ref name=Mylonas-163/&gt;

In 1923, [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Greece and Turkey made a successful population exchange]]. In early 1936, Turkey was interested in signing an agreement for the resettlement of 200,000 Muslims from Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=Mylonas-163/&gt;

Čubrilović believed that the Albanians were fanatic, superstitious and that previous expulsion plans, like those enacted within the wider Niš region during 1878 in areas such as the [[Toplica (river)|Toplica]] and the [[Morava Valley]]s, was the only effective way. He proposed that Albanians be called ''Turks'' and that their lives should be made as miserable as possible forcing them to leave. Arrangements eventually led to the relocation of tens of thousands of [[Kosovo Albanians]] to Turkey.&lt;ref name="Perritt2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry H.

==Aftermath and legacy==
The programme was difficult to put into practice because of the economical and political situation at the time. The April War and the collapse of Yugoslavia stopped it and the document remained hidden in archives for years. Čubrilović's paper was "erased" by the Communist authorities because they believed that "all non-Slavic" people should be incorporated into Yugoslavia. The International community found the document in the 1960s which was then given to Albanian President [[Enver Hoxha]] who used it to criticize the Yugoslav authorities, who denied that such a document even existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Danijela Nadj |url=http://www.hic.hr/books/jugoistocna-europa/velikesrbije.htm |title=Medjunarodni znanstveni skup "Jugoistocna Europa 1918.-1995." Ideologija Velike Srbije |website=Hic.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document was mentioned and published in January 1988 in the Belgrade newspaper ''[[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]]'', and later in [[Zagreb]]-based magazine ''Start''. Čubrilović's document was not supported by Yugoslav historians and professors except for [[Ivo Andrić]]. The text was later often quoted and cited as one of the fundamental documents of the [[Greater Serbia]] ideology in the 20th century; that is the basis for methods that were used during the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] by the Serbian authorities for the purpose of ethnic cleansing of Albanians, [[Muslims (nationality)|Muslims]], and [[Croats]].  Some authors believe that Čubrilović's plan to expel Albanians from Kosovo actualized in 1999 by [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s government under the name "[[Operation Horseshoe]]".&lt;ref name="Sell2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Sell|title=Slobodan Milosevic and the Destruction of Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fu1QiZ1n5AgC&amp;pg=PA304|date=4 August 2003|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3223-X|pages=304–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nin.co.rs/2002-07/18/24142.html |title=NIN / Da li je postojao "Plan potkovica" |website=Nin.co.rs |date=1999-07-16 |accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report is deemed chauvinistic and nationalistic and was used as a reference to the Serbian atrocities in Kosovo in 1999 by [[Joe DioGuardi]] as he spoke to the US parliament demanding that the United States should be launching [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO-attacks against Yugoslavia]]. During the campaign of ethnic cleansing, over 850,000 Albanians left Kosovo, but soon returned after the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops.

'''Trophic State Index (TSI)''' is a classification system designed to rate bodies of water based on the amount of biological activity they sustain.&lt;ref name="USFWaterAtlas"&gt;{{cite web |last1=University of Southern Florida Water Institute |title=Trophic State Index (TSI) |url=http://www.lake.wateratlas.usf.edu/shared/learnmore.asp?toolsection=lm_tsi |website=Learn More About Trophic State Index (TSI) - Lake.WaterAtlas.org |publisher=University of Southern Florida |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "trophic index" is commonly applied to lakes, any surface body of water may be indexed.

The TSI of a body of water is rated on a scale from zero to one hundred.&lt;ref name="USFWaterAtlas" /&gt; Under the TSI scale, bodies of water may be defined as:&lt;ref name="USFWaterAtlas" /&gt; 

* '''oligotrophic''' (TSI 0–40, having the least amount of biological productivity, "good" water quality);
* '''mesoeutrophic''' (TSI 40–60, having a moderate level of biological activity, "fair" water quality); or
* '''eutrophic''' to '''hypereutrophic''' (TSI 60–100, having the highest amount of biological activity, "poor" water quality).

The quantities of [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and other biologically useful nutrients are the primary determinants of a body of water's TSI. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus tend to be [[limiting resource]]s in standing water bodies, so increased concentrations tend to result in increased plant growth, followed by corollary increases in subsequent [[trophic level]]s.{{efn|Note that this use of trophic levels refers to feeding dynamics, and has a much different meaning than a body of water's ''trophic index''.}} Consequently, a body of water's trophic index may sometimes be used to make a rough estimate of its biological condition.&lt;ref name="USEPA"&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (2007) Carlson's Trophic State Index. ''Aquatic Biodiversity''. http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/aquatic/carlson.html ''accessed 17 February 2008''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carlson's Trophic State Index==
Carlson's index was proposed by Robert Carlson in his 1977 seminal paper, "A trophic state index for lakes".&lt;ref name="Carlson1977" /&gt; It is one of the more commonly used trophic indices and is the trophic index used by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt; The ''trophic state'' is defined as the total weight of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in a given water body at the time of measurement. Because they are of public concern, the Carlson index uses the algal biomass as
an objective classifier of a lake or other water body's trophic status.&lt;ref name="Carlson1977"&gt;Carlson,  R.E. (1977) A trophic state index for lakes. ''Limnology and Oceanography''. 22:2 361–369.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the US EPA, the Carlson Index should only be used with lakes that have relatively few rooted plants and non-algal turbidity sources.&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;

===Index variable===
Because they tend to correlate, three independent variables can be used to calculate the Carlson Index: ''[[chlorophyll|chlorophyll pigments]]'', ''total phosphorus'' and ''[[Secchi depth]]''. Of these three, chlorophyll will probably yield the most accurate measures, as it is the most accurate predictor of biomass. Phosphorus may be a more accurate estimation of a water body's summer trophic status than
chlorophyll if the measurements are made during the winter. Finally, the Secchi depth is probably the least accurate measure, but also the most affordable and expedient one. Consequently, citizen monitoring programs and other volunteer or large-scale surveys will often use the Secchi depth. By translating the Secchi transparency values to a log base 2 scale, each successive doubling of biomass is represented as a whole integer index number.&lt;ref name="Carlson1996"&gt;Carlson R.E. and J. Simpson (1996) A Coordinator's Guide to Volunteer Lake Monitoring Methods. ''North American Lake Management Society''. 96 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The Secchi depth, which measures water transparency, indicates the concentration of dissolved and particulate material in the water, which in turn can be used to derive the biomass. This relationship is expressed in the following equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac 1 z \right)\left(\ln \frac{I_0}{I_z}\right) = k_w + \alpha C&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''z'' = the depth at which the disk disappears,
:''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the intensity of light striking the water's surface,
:''I''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; is about 10% of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and is considered a constant,
:''k''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; is a coefficient for the attenuation of light by water and dissolved substances,
:''&amp;alpha;'' is treated as a constant with the units of square meters per milligram and
:''C'' is the concentration of particulate matter in units for milligrams per cubic meter.&lt;ref name="Carlson1977" /&gt;

==Trophic classifications==
A lake is usually classified as being in one of three possible classes: ''oligotrophic'', ''mesotrophic'' or ''eutrophic''. Lakes with extreme trophic indices may also be considered ''hyperoligotrophic'' or ''hypereutrophic''. The table below demonstrates how the index values translate into trophic classes.

Oligotrophic lakes generally host very little or no [[aquatic plant|aquatic vegetation]] and are relatively clear, while eutrophic lakes tend to host large quantities of organisms, including algal blooms. Each trophic class supports different types of fish and other organisms, as well. If the algal biomass in a lake or other water body reaches too high a concentration (say &gt;80 TSI), massive [[fish die-off]]s may occur as decomposing biomass deoxygenates the water.

===Oligotrophic===
[[File:20161001 Kurtkowiec i Czerwone Stawy Gąsienicowe 1730.jpg|thumb|[[Kurtkowiec Lake]], an oligotrophic lake in the [[Tatra Mountains]] of southern [[Poland]]]]

An oligotrophic lake is a lake with low [[primary productivity]], as a result of low [[nutrient]] content. These lakes have low [[algal]] production, and consequently, often have very clear waters, with high [[drinking water|drinking-water]] quality. The bottom waters of such lakes typically have ample [[oxygen]]; thus, such lakes often support many [[fish]] species such as [[lake trout]], which require cold, well-[[Oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenated]] waters. The oxygen content is likely to be higher in deep lakes, owing to their larger [[hypolimnion|hypolimnetic]] volume.

Ecologists use the term [[oligotroph]]ic to distinguish unproductive lakes, characterised by nutrient deficiency, from productive, eutrophic lakes, with an ample or excessive nutrient supply. Oligotrophic lakes are most common in cold regions underlain by resistant [[igneous]] rocks (especially [[granitic]] bedrock).

===Mesotrophic===
Mesotrophic lakes are lakes with an intermediate level of productivity. These lakes are commonly clear water lakes and ponds with beds of submerged aquatic plants and medium levels of nutrients.

The term mesotrophic is also applied to terrestrial habitats. Mesotrophic soils have moderate nutrient levels.

===Eutrophic===
{{Main|Eutrophication}}
[[Image:River algae Sichuan.jpg|thumb|upright|Algal bloom in a village river in the mountains near [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]], China]]

A eutrophic body of water, commonly a lake or pond, has high biological productivity. Due to excessive nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, these water bodies are able to support an abundance of aquatic plants. Usually, the water body will be dominated either by aquatic plants or algae. When aquatic plants dominate, the water tends to be clear. When algae dominate, the water tends to be darker. The algae engage in photosynthesis which supplies oxygen to the fish and biota which inhabit these waters. Occasionally, an excessive algal bloom will occur and can ultimately result in fish death, due to respiration by algae and bottom-living bacteria. The process of [[eutrophication]] can occur naturally and by [[human impact on the environment]].

Eutrophic comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''eutrophos'' meaning "well-nourished", from ''eu'' meaning good and ''trephein'' meaning "to nourish"&lt;ref&gt;Definition of [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/eutrophic eutrophic] at [[dictionary.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypereutrophic===
Hypereutrophic lakes are very nutrient-rich lakes characterized by frequent and severe nuisance [[algal blooms]] and low transparency. Hypereutrophic lakes have a visibility depth of less than 3 feet, they have greater than 40 micrograms/litre total [[chlorophyll]] and greater than 100 micrograms/litre [[phosphorus]].

The excessive algal blooms can also significantly reduce oxygen levels and prevent life from functioning at lower depths creating dead zones beneath the surface.

Likewise, large algal blooms can cause [[biodilution]] to occur, which is a decrease in the concentration of a pollutant with an increase in [[trophic level]]. This is opposed to [[biomagnification]] and is due to a decreased concentration from increased algal uptake.

==Trophic index drivers==
Both natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] factors can influence a lake or other water body's trophic index. A water body situated in a nutrient-rich region with high [[net primary productivity]] may be naturally eutrophic. Nutrients carried into water bodies from [[non-point sources]] such as agricultural runoff, residential fertilisers, and sewage will all increase the algal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], and can easily cause an oligotrophic lake to become hypereutrophic.

==Management targets==
Often, the desired trophic index differs between stakeholders. Water-fowl enthusiasts (e.g. duck hunters) may want a lake to be eutrophic so that it will support a large population of waterfowl. Residents, though, may want the same lake to be oligotrophic, as this is more pleasant for swimming and boating. Natural resource agencies are generally responsible for reconciling these conflicting uses and determining what a water body's trophic index should be.

The '''Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala''' ('''USAC''', ''University of San Carlos of Guatemala'') is the biggest and oldest university of Guatemala; it is also the fourth founded in [[the Americas]]. Established in the [[Kingdom of Guatemala]] during the Spanish colony, it was the most prestigious institution of higher education in [[Central America]] — and the only one in Guatemala until 1954.&lt;ref group = lower-alpha&gt;In 1954 a coup led by the National Liberation Movement which was sponsored by the [[United Fruit Company]] and coordinated by [[CIA]] and [[State Department]] American operatives who had links with the US company triumphed .&lt;/ref&gt;

The University has had five major transformations:
* '''Royal and Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo''' (1676–1829): Established during the colony by the Spanish Crown in the 17th century, approved by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and directed by [[regular clergy|regular orders]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. After the [[Act of Independence of Central America|Independence in 1821]], it was called only Pontifical University.
* '''Academia de Ciencias''' ('''Academy of Science''') (1834–1840): a secular institution created during the [[Central American Federation]] by the liberal governor [[Mariano Galvez]].
* '''Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo''' (1840–1875): an ecclesiastical institution run by the [[regular clergy|regular orders]] during the governments of [[Rafael Carrera]] and [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]], ratified by the [[Concordat of 1854]].
* '''National University of Guatemala''' (1875–1944): a secular and [[positivism|positivist]] institution divided into colleges of Notary and Law, Medicine and Pharmacy.
* '''University of San Carlos of Guatemala''' (1944-): a socially oriented secular institution established after the [[Guatemalan Revolution|Revolution of 1944]].

The University grew out of the Colegio de Santo Tomás de Aquino (Saint Thomas Aquinas High School), founded in 1562 by Bishop [[Francisco Marroquín]].&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt; After a series of [[1773 Guatemala earthquake|major earthquakes in 1773]], which destroyed many parts of the city of Santiago de los Caballeros, the crown authorities ordered the evacuation of the city and the relocation of its government, religious and university functions to the new capital [[Guatemala City|La Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción]], the  university's present location.&lt;ref name=paganini&gt;{{harvnb|Paganini|1947|pp=49–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years, from the 16th to 19th centuries, it offered studies in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[liturgical]] law, [[theology]], [[philosophy]], [[medicine]] and [[indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]].

However, their activities were interrupted after the Independence of [[Central America]] in 1821. At that time, each province of the former [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] promoted the creation of a local university. The university remained as an institution in Guatemala, but it closed in 1829, after the conservative [[criollo people|criollos]] were expelled from Central America, and in 1834 converted into the "Academy of Sciences". In 1840, with the comeback of the conservatives, it was turned into the "Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo" once again and even for a short period between 1918 and 1920, it was called "Estrada Cabrera University" in honor of the then president, lawyer [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]]. After the [[Guatemalan Revolution|Revolution of October 1944]], the USAC managed to obtain total autonomy, but from 1954, with the resurgence of Catholic education and the establishment of private universities, an attrition process of the university began, which included constant nonpayment of the budget percentage that corresponds to the University by the Constitution and the persecution and assassination of student leaders and faculty members throughout the duration of the [[Guatemala Civil War]] (1960–1996).

==History==
===First era: Royal and Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo ===
[[File:Carlo Borromeo.jpg|200px|thumb|Saint [[Charles Borromeo|Carlo Borromeo]], by [[Giovanni Ambrogio Figino]]. Oil on canvas, 41 × 48 cm. [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]]. The University of San Carlos was established under his protection on 31 January 1676.&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt;]]
The university tradition in Guatemala and Central America goes back to the 17th century, when the University of San Carlos was founded on 31 January 1676 by Royal Decree of [[Carlos II of Spain|Carlos II]] in the colonial capital of [[Antigua, Guatemala|Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]]. The Royal University of San Carlos became the third Royal College founded in Spanish America and it was consecrated by [[Pope Innocent XI]] on June 18, 1687.&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt;

[[File:1a. Universidad.JPG|thumb|200px|Section of the memorial to the first University in the city of [[Antigua Guatemala]]&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt;]]
Colonization by the Spaniards implied a new formation of society, with its brand new civil and ecclesiastical institutions. As time went by, residents demanded a place in the royal institutions for their descendants, in return for the heroics of their ancestors during the battles of conquest. However, there were no schools to teach youth to become public servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pavón Romero|first=Armando|title=Universitarios en la Nueva España|publisher=CESU-UNAM |location=México|year=2003|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the second half of the 16th century that the first initiatives to found schools that covered more than religious indoctrination and reading and writing took place. The first bishop of Guatemala, [[Francisco Marroquín]], requested the approval of the Spanish crown to set up a grammar class, in which Latin was to be taught, as it was the intellectual language of the time. This single fact has been the basis to perpetuate the myth that links bishop Marroquin to the early stages of the University of San Carlos.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Among those historians that have perpetuated the myth is Juan Rodríguez Cabal, who presented a letter that Marroquín sent to Spain in 1548 requesting the establishment of a university. Rodríguez Cabal's investigations were published for the first time in the 1950s, and as part of the third centennial of the foundation of the University of San Carlos in 1976, the University of San Carlos press made several more copies.&lt;ref name=cabal/&gt;}}

Towards the end of his life, in 1562, Marroquin left in his will some funds to set up a school, the Santo Tomás de Aquino, where  Grammar, Arts, Philosophy and Theology would be taught. The beneficiaries of this pious enterprise would be the children of poor Spaniards, given that they could not travel to cities (like Mexico) where the Royal Universities were. This will has been also interpreted by scholars as the origin of the University of San Carlos. However, the late priest had a clear idea of the difference between a school (i.e., a home for students, with or without classes) and a university (or General Study) where the students earned degrees. About this, historian John Tate Lanning tells that "his will is so well known that there are some scholars that have not even seen it and have already read a lot of things that are not there at all. Nowhere in his will Marroquín talks about any university, much less talk about his intentions to establish one..."{{sfn|Tate Lanning|1977|p=8}} On the other hand, what is documented is that major Pedro Crespo Suárez left in his will twenty thousand pesos to set up the classes for the university that is "in the works with the authorities".&lt;ref name=hernandez30&gt;{{harvnb|Hernández de León|1930|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1598, the third bishop of Guatemala Gómez Fernández de Córdoba y Santillán, O.S.H., following ecclesiastical directions from the [[Council of Trent]] and on the basis of the royal decrees issued after that council, authorized the foundation of the "Nuestra Señora de la Asunción" School and Seminary, which was the first higher educational institution in the [[Kingdom of Guatemala]].{{sfn|Pérez Puente|2012|pp=188-194}} The [[Jesuits]], who already had their Colegio de San Borja and wanted to run the Seminary themselves, opposed its foundation, as they did not like other [[regular clergy|regular orders]] - [[Mercedarians]], [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] or the leader of the [[secular clergy]] took an initiative in religious and educational matters.

The president of the Real Audiencia authorized that classes should start while they were awaiting the authorization to build the new school for the students; at the time they only had one classroom in the Dominican convent where, in theory, they gave the Arts, Theology and Religion classes.{{sfn|Pérez Puente|2012|p=195}} After several decades, discussions and petitions, king [[Carlos II of Spain|Carlos II]] on 31 January 1676, granted a license to the city of [[Antigua Guatemala|Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]] to found a University. This would be third royal university in the Spanish Empire in America, and the second in New Spain, after the one in Mexico.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;To review the process that led to the foundation of the University of San Carlos,
it is recommended to read procedure 373 of the Guatemalan Real Audiencia en the General Archive of Indias.&lt;/ref&gt; After the disputatious process of organization, and five years after the royal decree, the university started officially its lectures of five of the nine classes, on 7 January 1681, with little more of sixty registered students and with its first president, Dr. José de Baños y Soto Mayor, who was in charge of the Cathedral, Preacher of the King of Spain and Doctor from the University of Osuna.&lt;ref name=hernandez30/&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;About the first setup of the university, the historical records are not too precise and even contradictory. See in the Central American General Archive, A1. Leg. 1885, Exp. 12245.&lt;/ref&gt; The university started under the protection of [[Charles Borromeo|San Carlos Borromeo]], with its first directive written by Francisco Saraza y Arce, who copied from those of the University of México which, in turn, were adapted from the [[Universidad de Salamanca]] in Spain.&lt;ref name=paganini/&gt;

==== First graduates and science teaching ====
[[File:Antonio Liendo y Goicochea.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Antonio Liendo y Goicoechea]], a Franciscan friar, reformed education at the University.  He was a professor of most of the eventual leaders of the Central American independence.]]
In 1660 the printer [[:es:José de Pineda Ibarra]] arrived at [[Antigua Guatemala|Santiago de los Caballeros]]. Among all his works he introduced university graduation cards, where it was written what the final exam was going to be about, date and time for the exam, and the names of the university authorities and student sponsors.{{sfn|Luján Muñoz|1980|p=12}}

On 11 July 1717, thirty years after the its papal sanction, the first medicine student graduated; his name was Vicente Ferrer González. The next physician to graduate was Pedro Palacios y Cóbar, who presented his final exam seventeen years later; and forty-seven years after that, the eminent Dr. [[José Felipe Flores]] graduated.

The Franciscan friar Juan Antonio Liendo y Goicoechea reformed university education towards the end of the 18th century by introducing science; Chemistry, Physics, Anatomy and Mathematics; and technology studies.{{sfn|Luján Muñoz|1980|p=12}}

=== Second era: Science Academy ===
[[File:Retratogalvez 2014-06-22 11-25.jpg|thumb|200px|Doctor [[Mariano Gálvez]] during his gubernatorial term as Head of State of Guatemala&lt;br /&gt;He founded the agnostic Science Academy in substitution of the religious University of San Carlos.&lt;br /&gt;He is buried in the Museum of the University - formerly College of Law-.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Viaje a Guatemala|year=n.d.|url=http://www.viajeaguatemala.com/museo-nacional-de-historia-donde-guatemala-cuenta-su-pasado|journal=Viaje a Guatemala|title=Museo Nacional de Historia: donde Guatemala cuenta su pasado|accessdate=30 June 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

After Independence, the University of San Carlos lost its Royal status and became simply the "Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo" but it was in a precarious position: after the move from [[Antigua Guatemala|Santiago de los Caballeros]] it had to use a borrowed building to teach, and in 1821 its new one was not finished yet; besides, the political climate of the region was very unstable at the time. In 1825, Dr. [[Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol]] was elected as president of the University, and kept the religious curriculum that the institution had had for decades. However, in 1829, the conservative regime of his brother [[Mariano de Aycinena y Piñol]] was defeated by the liberal general [[Francisco Morazán]], and the conservatives - mainly the Aycinena family - and the [[regular clergy]] were expelled from [[Central America]] and the University was suspended. In 1834, when doctor [[Mariano Gálvez]] was head of State of Guatemala, he found the Science Academy in the State, which took the position that the Pontifical University had previously occupied; the new university eliminated religious education altogether and implemented clases of [[Algebra]], [[Geometry]], [[Trigonometry]] and [[Physics]]; besides, the institution began to offer studies in engineering. The Academy of Science was open until 1840, because in that year the conservatives regained power in Guatemala under the strong leadership of General [[Rafael Carrera]] who reopened the old "Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo";&lt;ref name=cabal&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodríguez Cabal|first=Juan|title= Universidad de Guatemala: su origen, fundación, organización|publisher=Universitaria|location=Guatemala|year=1976|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Aycinena was once again named as president of the university.

=== Third era: Pontifical University ===
{{Main article|Concordat of 1854}}

[[File:Concordato2.jpg|thumb|200px|Article #2 of the [[Concordat of 1854]] by which the Government of Guatemala entrusted the country's education to the Catholic Church]]
The power that the Catholic Church and the Aycinena family - to whom most of Carrera's advisors and secretaries belonged - had during the conservative regime in Guatemala was ratified the [[Concordat of 1854]], in which Guatemala entrusted the education of its people to the regular clergy of the Catholic Church, committed itself to respect all church property -including haciendas, monasteries and sugar mills, authorized mandatory tithing and let the bishops censor all the country's publications; in return, Guatemala obtained indulgences for Army members, was allowed to keep all those properties that had been taken from the orders in 1829 - provided they were now in private hands, received a tax of the church inconme and had the right to prosecute any priest or bishop under Guatemalan law, if necessary.{{sfn|Aycinena|1854|p=1-16}} The [[concordat]] was designed by [[Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol]], who was a cabinet member of the government - besides being the University president; then, it was first ratified by Secretary of the Interior, Justice and Ecclesiastical affairs [[Pedro de Aycinena]] and finally, approved by president [[Rafael Carrera]], who in 1854 was appointed as Guatemala's president for life.

=== Fourth era: The university during the Liberal regimes===

After the Liberal Revolution in 1871, the conservatives defeat resulted in a complete change of direction in the education in Guatemala:  once again the [[regular clergy]] was expelled from the country, and all of their properties we confiscated. The education changed from completely religious to agnostic and kept like that until 1954.

The new Liberal regime founded the Polytechnic School -Military Academy- in 1873 to prepare military engineers, topographers and telegraphers, besides military officers. In July 1875, [[Justo Rufino Barrios]] closed the Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo and in its place founded the Central College of Law and the Central College of Medicine and Pharmacy which formed the National University of Guatemala.  The government decreed that the teaching of Medicine had to be practical - as much as possible - and philosophical, with all the modern scientific theories.{{sfn|Chapa Bezanilla|2004|p=58}} In 1877, the government found the Western College of Law in [[Quetzaltenango]]{{sfn|Arévalo Martínez|1945|p=12}} and in 1879 founded the National Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcd.gob.gt/biblioteca-nacional/|title=Biblioteca Nacional|location=Guatemala|author=Ministerio de Cultura y Deportes|accessdate=26 July 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President general [[Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián]] (1885–1892) founded the Western College of Medicine in [[Quetzaltenango]] and granted scholarship to the best students to continue their education abroad, both from Guatemala and Quetzaltenango.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Museo Militar|url=http://museo.mil.gt/v1/index.php/manuel-lisandro-barillas |journal=Museo Militar de Guatemala|title=Manuel Lisandro Barillas|year=n.d.|accessdate=7 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211055122/http://museo.mil.gt/v1/index.php/manuel-lisandro-barillas|archivedate=11 December 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Torres|2007|p=12}}

On 21 March 1893, during the government of general [[José María Reina Barrios]], decree #193 of the [[Congress of Guatemala|National Assembly]] established that all the board of directors members, deans and faculty of the National University colleges would be appointed by the [[President of Guatemala]]; thus the colleges lost the autonomy to select their own authorities.{{sfn|Arévalo Martínez|1945|p=76}}

In 1897, after the failure of the [[Exposición Centroamericana]] and the deep economic crisis that ensued, Reina Barrios implemented austerity measures that included closing the schools and University colleges.{{sfn|Torres Espinoza|2007|p=14}} At the end of that year, Salvador Mendieta came back to Guatemala to attend the University, but due the political stability of the times after the revolts against Reina Barrios both in the Eastern and Western regions of the country once it was known that Reina Barrios had extended his presidential term, and the closing of the university, decided to move to [[México]] in early 1898.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=5}} However, after the assassination of president Reina Barrios on 8 February, the Guatemalan government reopened the educational institutions, claiming that they were the basis for all the Liberal institutions;  Mendieta, then, registered to begin that semester in the College of Law of the National University.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=5}}

==== Estrada Cabrera presidency====
{{Main article|Manuel Estrada Cabrera}}

{{quote box|align=left|width=300px|At that moment, the new association started the student body reaction against the feudalist Centralamerica that prepared its students for political servility.|Salvador Mendieta&lt;br /&gt;About "El Derecho" student association&lt;br /&gt;1899}}

[[File:Escuelasederecho1907.jpg|200px|thumb|College of Law in 1897.]]
[[File:Medicina1907.jpg|200px|thumb|College of Medicine and Pharmacy in 1897.]]

Nicaraguan citizen Salvador Mendieta, who had already been expelled once from the Central National Institute for Boys by the former president [[José María Reyna Barrios]] for attempting to form a student association aimed at criticizing the school principal,{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=5}} founded on 18 June 1899 along with other fellow students "El Derecho" student association.  The new association had members from the colleges of Law, Engineering and Medicine and an ideology identified with the Central American union.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=5-6}} The new society became public on 15 September 1899 when the Guatemala City mayor invited some of its members to ceremonies for the Independence of Central America celebration that took place in the College of Law.

This society had several humanistic and social goals:
* gather all the Central American students around the idea of the region unity
* tighten social relationships and encourage intellectual sharing
* promote the formation of similar societies all across Central America
* organize the fight between those who think and those who oppress.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=6-7}}

Due to the strong accusations against his presidency, Estrada Cabrera closed "El Derecho" after only a year of its life, and they had Mendieta sent to prison after which he sent the Nicaraguan into exile for promoting rebellion against his government.{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=7}}

In April 1899, the National Assembly submitted Estrada Cabrera a decree declaring the autonomy of the University colleges to elect their own authorities; the president vetoed the decree indicating that "''the colleges could not be autonomous given that they were dependent on the State in all senses [...]''"{{sfn|Arévalo Martínez|1945|p=76}} Therefore, the different colleges remain as dependencies of the Secretary of Public Education, which submitted a yearly review of their status, and also recommended the president who to choose as dean and faculty members. Also, by a decree published on 16 June 1900, Estrada Cabrera militarized all the male student centers, including the university colleges, who received military instruction for the six first months of their careers.&lt;ref name=arzobispado/&gt;

[[File:Usac1907.jpg|thumb|200px|Facsimile of a decree published in ''El Guatemalteco'', official newspaper of Guatemala in 1907, showing that President of Guatemala appointed the National University faculty members.{{sfn|El Guatemalteco|22 March 1907|p=4}}]]

By 1907, the colleges were:

* College of Law (seventy students)
* College of Medicine and Pharmacy (150 students)
* Dentistry institute (5 students)
* School of midwives (10 students)
* School of Engineering (15 students){{sfn|El Guatemalteco|22 May 1907|p=6-7}}

Note that in 1907, the school of Engineering was part of the National University. This school, due to budget reasons, was alternatively part of the National University and the Military Academy; finally in 1908, the school was left as part of the university for good, after president Estrada Cabrera closed the Academy following a failed assassination attempt that the cadets had plotted against him.{{sfn|Arévalo Martínez|1945|p=128}}

In  1918, the servility towards the presidents was at its peak and the university was renamed "University of Guatemala, Estrada Cabrera", by decree of the National Assembly on 2 May 1918.{{sfn|El Guatemalteco|15 May 1918|p=3}} Francisco Galvez Portocarrero, close friend of the president, lobbied heavily for the new university given that in a recent trip to [[Perú]], [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] he liked the model the universities followed in those South American countries. Upon returning to Guatemala, Galvez - who was also a National Assembly representative- brought along a complete library about universities and convinced both the president and the Assembly members to create the "University of Guatemala".{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930|p=15 de mayo}}

==== Carlos Herrera presidency (1920–1921) ====
{{Main article|Carlos Herrera y Luna}}

University "Estrada Cabrera", was closed after the falling of the former president. However, one of the first decrees of the new president [[Carlos Herrera y Luna]] -appointed president by the National Assembly on 8 April- was to appoint new authorities and faculty for the National University, which now had the following academic departments:{{sfn|Silva H.|n.d.|p=58}}

* College of Natural Science and Pharmacy
* College of Law
* College of Medicine
* College of engineering

Herrera y Luna, as a token of appreciation of all the efforts of the university students during the last days of Estrada Cabrera regime, gave the different colleges their autonomy to elected their own authorities, although it did not grant them full autonomy.  At this time the Student Body Association was founded and included [[Miguel Angel Asturias]], among a series of other Guatemalan intellectuals, and the second era of "El Derecho" Law student association, which had been closed by Estrada Cabrera in 1899.{{sfn|Silva H.|s.f.|p=58}}

=== Fifth era: the University after the 1944 Revolution ===

After the revolution against general Ubico's successor, general [[Federico Ponce Vaides]], on 20 October 1944, the new government granted its complete autonomy to the University; Decree #12 on 11 November 1944 granted autonomy and renamed the institution as "Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala" ("University of San Carlos of Guatemala"). The university's new role was to be director of college education in Guatemala, and to cooperated in study and solution of the critical problems that Guatemala faced at the time.&lt;ref name=arzobispado&gt;{{cite journal|author=ODHA|title=Era por la vida tras por lo que íbamos|editor=Monseñor Mario Ríos Mont|year=n.d.|location=Guatemala|journal=Oficina de Derechos Humanos del Arzobispado|url=http://www.odhag.org.gt/pdf/Era%20tras%20la%20vida.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729151405/http://www.odhag.org.gt/pdf/Era%20tras%20la%20vida.pdf|archivedate=29 July 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New colleges were created that time:

* College of Human Studies: created by then president Dr. [[Juan José Arévalo]] on 17 September 1945. Among its founder were Dr. [[Eduardo García Máynez]] -professor emeritus of the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]]- as honorary faculty. The college studied: [[Philosophy]], [[History]], [[Literature]], [[Psychology]] and [[Pedagogy]].&lt;ref name=arevalo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc3KBvf5gwI |title=Vida de Juan José Arévalo|website=Youtube|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* College of Agriculture
* College of Architecture
* College of Economics&lt;ref name=cabal/&gt;

Likewise, access was granted to both women and to all the society members that had been excluded from the institution in the past.&lt;ref name=imparcial &gt;{{harvnb|El Imparcial|25 de noviembre de 1944|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== After 1954 coup d'état ====
{{See also|Operation PBSUCCESS}}

Following its constitutional mandate, the university became involved in the political life of the country, presenting concrete social, economic and political proposals.  However, with the beginning of the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] -major super powers that split world dominance after their victory in [[World War II]], the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état]], the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959 and the influx of students from all over the social spectrum in Guatemala, Marxism became radical in the University. Besides, then archbishop of Guatemala [[Mariano Rossell y Arellano]] found out that it was urgent to recover some of the former influence [[Catholic Church]] used to have, and that it lost during the liberal regime of [[Justo Rufino Barrios]] in 1872, and therefore decided to work with the [[United Fruit Company]] to get rid of the Revolutionary governments whom he accused of [[atheist]] and [[communist]]. On 4 April 1954, Rossell y Arellano issued an open letter in which he denounced Communism advances in the country, and begged Guatemalans to rise in arms and fight against the common enemy of God and the Land. His letter has published all over Guatemala, and even though he kept claiming that the Catholic Church was not seeking privileges in its anticommunist quest, Rossel y Arellano was able that after the 1954 coup, new president colonel [[Carlos Castillo Armas]] included the following back in the new Constitution of Guatemala, for the first time since 1872:&lt;ref name=esquipulas /&gt;
* that the Catholic Church had the right to own real estate and other properties
* that religious education was declared of public interest
* that the State supported religious education
* that there were independent private universities not connected with University of San Carlos.&lt;ref name=esquipulas&gt;{{cite web|author=Esquipulas en línea|url=http://www.esquipulas.com.gt/biografias/monsenor-mariano-rossell-y-arellano/|website=Esquipulas en línea|title=Biografia de Mariano Rossell Arellano|accessdate=1 September 2014|date=n.d.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220213329/http://www.esquipulas.com.gt/biografias/monsenor-mariano-rossell-y-arellano/|archivedate=20 December 2013|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This way, the Catholic Church recover some of the former power it held before 1871, when the Liberal Reform confiscated its properties and cancelled its privileges, in a direct attack against it as the main conservative party member of the time.

==== Nottebohm case and the Dean of the College of Law ====
{{Main article|Nottebohm case}}

[[File:Adolfo Molina Orantes 005.jpg|thumb|200px|Doctor in Law [[:es:Adolfo Molina Orantes|Adolfo Molina Orantes]], College of Law Dean and legal advisor of the Guatemalan delegates for the [[Nottebohm case]] before the [[International Court of Justice]].]]

Between 1951 and 1955, College of Law dean, Dr. [[:es:Adolfo Molina Orantes|Adolfo Molina Orantes]], worked as a legal advisor for the Guatemalan delegation before the [[International Court of Justice]] of [[The Hague]] for the [[Nottebohm case]] (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) [1955].  The case about Mr. Nottebohm, who was born 16 September 16, 1881, in Hamburg, [[Germany]] and possessed German citizenship although he lived in Guatemala from 1905 until 1943 because he never became a citizen of Guatemala. On October 9, 1939, Nottebohm applied to become a naturalized citizen of Liechtenstein. The application was approved and he became a citizen of that country. He then returned to Guatemala on his Liechtenstein passport and informed the local government of his change of nationality. When he tried to return to Guatemala once again in 1943 he was refused entry as an enemy alien since the Guatemalan authorities did not recognize his naturalization and regarded him as still German. It has been suggested that the timing of the event was due to the recent entry of the United States and Guatemala into the Second World War. He was later extradited to the United States, where he was held at an internment camp until the end of the war. All his possessions in Guatemala were confiscated. After his release, he lived out the rest of his life in Liechtenstein.&lt;ref name=icj/&gt;

The Government of Liechtenstein granted Nottebohm protection against unjust treatment by the government of Guatemala and petitioned the International Court of Justice. However, the government of Guatemala argued that Nottebohm did not gain Liechtenstein citizenship for the purposes of international law. The court agreed and thus stopped the case from continuing.
&lt;ref name=icj&gt;{{harvnb|International Court of Justice|1955|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nottebohm case was subsequently cited in many definitions of [[nationality]]. and Dr. Molina Orantes was recognized as an expert in international Law and named permanent consultant of the International Court.

==== Private universities ====

As a result of the political climate changes after the coup of 1954, the society elites decided to create their own private universities,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[Universidad Rafael Landívar]] in 1961, [[Universidad del Valle de Guatemala]] in 1966, [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] in 1971, and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; which would have very different ideologies from the ones presented in the University of San Carlos.  Basically the new institutions would have capitalist and liberal ideologies while the national university chose Marxism.  After heavy lobbying, in 1965 the new ISR tax law exonerated potential private universities from any kind of taxation and state contributions, and in 1966 the Law of Private Universities was approved.{{sfn|Molina|2011|p=}}

==== Research on Guatemalan history ====

In 1957 the highly regarded Marxist historian [[:es:Severo Martínez Peláez]] return to Guatemala after his exile and joined the University as a faculty member. The College of Economics dean, Rafael Piedrasanta Arandi, and the university president, Edmundo Vásquez Martínez, approved a scholarship for Martinez Pelaez to research the [[Archivo General de Indias]] in [[Sevilla]], [[Spain]] between 1967 and 1969. From this research comes his main work, ''La patria del criollo'', published in 1970, as well as the program of Economic History of Central America of the College of Economics and the total reform of the School of History in 1978.{{sfn|Centro de Estudios Urbanos y Regionales (USAC)|1998|p=4}}

In 1979, due to death threats from the general [[Fernando Romeo Lucas García]] regime, Martínez Peláez had to go into exile once again with his family and continued with his research and teaching activities in the [[Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla]] in [[Mexico]], where he was an invited speaker in several seminars and created new curricula for the College of History.  Besides, he had important meetings with historians and Guatemalan exiles in Mexico.{{sfn|Centro de Estudios Urbanos y Regionales (USAC)|1998|p=15}}

==== Veterinary medicine ====
{{See also|Veterinary medicine}}

The College of Veterinary was created on 27 September 1957,&lt;ref name="Man"&gt;{{harvnb|Facultad de Veterinaria y Zootenica|s.f.|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and initially was part of the College of Medicine and was located in the old Medicine Building in Guatemala City Historical Downtown. In 1958 and 1959 it moved into private homes that the university rented &lt;ref name="Man"/&gt; in zones 9 and 4 of Guatemala City;  it also used the University's Botanic Garden library in zone 4. By 1960, the College of Veterinary moved into its definite home in the main University campus.&lt;ref name="Man"/&gt;

On 11 January 1969 the School of Animal Studies, which was independent of the School of Veterinary medicine.&lt;ref name="Man"/&gt; and on 27 September 1974 it moved into the new modular buildings on the southwest section of the main campus, next to the Veterinary Medicine Hospital.&lt;ref name="Man"/&gt;

===Repression and decline ===
{{Main article|Guatemala Civil War}}

During general [[Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes]] presidency, the university started suffering repression due to its position alongside the main labor unions, with three students murdered in front of the College of Law in 1962.

==== The EXMIBAL Case====
During the government of [[Julio César Méndez Montenegro]] the possibility of giving the nickel mines in [[Izabal Department|Izabal]] in concession to a Canadian mining company was brought to the table, but it did not materialized. As soon as the general [[Carlos Arana Osorio]] took office on 1 July 1970, he reopened the case and began working in for EXMIBAL to get a concession. However, many social sectors opposed to it, arguing that it would be too costly for the country. One of the main opponents was the Commission that the [[University of San Carlos]] created to discuss the matter; among the members of the commission was the lawyer [[:es:Oscar Adolfo Mijangos López|Oscar Adolfo Mijangos López]], then representative in the [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]], the respected Guatemalan intellectual [[:es:Alfonso Bauer Paiz|Alfonso Bauer Paiz]] -who had been part of the staff of presidents [[Juan José Arévalo Bermejo]] and [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzman]], and Julio Carney Herrera&lt;ref name=arzobispado/&gt;  Both Camey Herrera and Bauer Paiz were shot in November 1970: Carney died of his wounds while Bauer Paz, severely wounded, had to go into exile.&lt;ref name=rakosy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minesandcommunities.org/article.php?a=7057|website=MAC: Mines and communities|title=Victimization - the EXMIBAL Story|last=Rakosy|first=Betsy|year=2002|accessdate=17 September 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006082651/http://www.minesandcommunities.org/article.php?a=7057|archivedate=6 October 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission members had strongly opposed the conditions proposed by the Government to grant the concession EXMIBAL; after the attack against Bauer Paiz and Carney, on 13 February 1971 Mijangos López was assassinated by unknown assailants as he left his office long the 4th Avenue in Zone 1 of the [[Guatemala City]]. Mijangos Lopez had been under the fatal impression that the government was not going to assassinate him because he was on a wheelchair since 1958.&lt;ref name=arzobispado/&gt;

On 8 May 1971, Arana Osorio's administration finally granted the concession to EXMIBAL;&lt;ref name=arzobispado/&gt; it covered 385 square kilometers in the area of [[El Estor]], with and initial investment of US$228 million. The mine, built in the mountains of indigenous maya Q'eqchi people, included a residential complex of 700 homes, numerous offices, a hospital, a small shopping center, school, a golf course and a large area for industrial processing.&lt;ref name=rakosy/&gt;

==== Laugerud and Lucas García military governments====
{{Main article|Kjell Eugenio Laugerud García|Fernando Romeo Lucas García|Guatemalan Civil War}}

During the military governments of the seventies, the tension between the government and the university kept growing, until it reached its peak in 1978 during the massive demonstration that occurred to protest rising urban public transportation costs. The Association of University Students (AEU) had a leading role in the protests, but this brought persecution of their leaders and the murder of the secretary general of the association [[Oliverio Castañeda de León]], on 20 October of that year.  Just fifteen days after the murder of Castañeda de León, was missing his successor, Antonio Ciani García, and over the next 18 months almost every student leader and university faculty with political connections were threatened (even with the legal parties). Whoever did not paid attention and continued with their protest activities, was simply killed or kidnapped.

In early 1979, the following attacks occurred against renowned members of the University:
* On 25 January 1979,  [[Alberto Fuentes Mohr]], Doctor of Economics, [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]] representative, leader of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and former Minister of Finance and Foreign Affairs during the administration of [[Julio César Méndez Montenegro]], was murdered.
* That same day, but a few hours later, was shot and killed the student and union leader Ricardo Martinez Solorzano.
* On 14 February, Manuel Lisandro Andrade Roca, general secretary of the University in the tenure of [[Saúl Osorio Paz]] as university president -and a student leader during the "Marches of 1962"- was killed.
* On 22 March, former Guatemala City mayor [[Manuel Colom Argueta]] was killed, in an operation in which his murderers allegedly used a helicopter to direct the operation&lt;ref name=Aguilera&gt;{{harvnb|Aguilera Peralta|Romero Imery|1981|pp=135–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colom had been director of Center for Urban and Regional Studies (CEUR) of the University of San Carlos of Guatemala and a political leader of the United Revolutionary Front (FUR). Next to Fuentes Mohr, he was the most prominent members of the legal political opposition and their deaths ended, even more, the political space in Guatemala. These murders and threats against leaders of the FUR and the PSD continued in 1979 and 1980, and in subsequent years against the [[Guatemalan Christian Democracy]] party.
At the University, university president [[Saúl Osorio Paz]], after attacks on his colleagues and death threats against him, began to live in presidency, protected by student brigades of the communist FRENTE student party. In an unprecedented case, the president directed the University from underground for almost two years.&lt;ref name=Aguilera/&gt;

The effect of state repression was worse on the student movement: the AEU ended decimated. Despite all this, the association continued to be a belligerent organization during this campaign of terror. To protect themselves, the AEU restructured its organizational form such that their leaders were not so vulnerable, and declined to reveal their names.

In January 1979, a new freshmen generation arrived to the university. Many of them had been members of the CEEM or student associations in the public institutes and had participated in the events of October 1978. It was them who took the leadership of the AEU. But it was much more difficult to replace the fallen or exiled faculty, which resulted in a marked decline in the academic quality of the institution.&lt;ref name=comisionaguda/&gt; Later, laws that severely restricted the university autonomy were proposed, and violating the constitutional mandate to give 5% of the national budget to the institution became commonplace for the government.&lt;ref name=comisionaguda&gt;{{harvnb|Comisión para el Esclarecimiento Histórico: Agudización|1999|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Burning the Spain Embassy in Guatemala ====
{{See also|Guatemalan Civil War}}

On 31 January 1980, several students from the University of San Carlos advised a k'iche' peasant group who wanted to let the world know about their precarious situation; when  the country's newspapers did not dare to publish their demands, and after all legal avenues to be heard had been exhausted, the group decided to take the premises of the Embassy of Spain and use it as a platform for their demands.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Ambassador [[Máximo Cajal López]] had visited the k'iche' farmer communities a few months before, and had gathered information for a report on them, which was never published, but the draft of which still exists.&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction of the government of general [[Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia]] was strong and direct: police surrounded the premises of the Embassy and after several hours of siege, the situation ended with the burning of the room where all the people who were inside the embassy had taken refugre, including almost the entire Embassy staff and some random visitors, including former vice president of Guatemala, [[Eduardo Cáceres Lehnhoff]] and former Foreign Affairs Minister, [[Adolfo Molina Orantes]].&lt;ref name=niunovivo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watchv=FG6fh9M8wdc |title = Ni uno vivo|website=YouTube|accessdate = July 2, 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only two survivors were Ambassador [[Máximo Cajal López]] and peasant Gregorio Yuja Xona, who were taken to the Private Hospital Herrera Llerandi. Yuja was kidnapped there and a group tried to kidnap the ambassador, but he was taken from the hospital just in time by the Ambassador of Costa Rica in Guatemala; Cajal left the country that night. Yuja, meanwhile, was tortured and his body thrown off the premises of the President mansion at the University of San Carlos. His body was buried in the Heroes and Martyrs Plaza on Central Campus.&lt;ref name=niunovivo /&gt;

==== 1985 civil unrest: military invasion of Central Campus ====
{{Main article|Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores}}

During the government of general [[Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores]], the Mutual Support Group (GAM) -led by [[Nineth Montenegro]]- was founded{{sfn|Siglo 21|9 July 2010|p=}} and the High School Student Coordination Group (CEEM) also gained considerable strength. The latter was formed by students from the Central National Institute for Boys, the Central Normal Institute for Young Ladies Belén and Rafael Aqueche&lt;ref group = lower-alpha&gt;By 1985, the economic elites had left Guatemala City downtown, along with these once premier schools which now were attended by the low middle and low income areas of the city.&lt;/ref&gt;  which organized mass protests in September 1985 against the rising prices for public transportation. At least ten people died in Guatemala City in the most extensive wave of urban unrest since protests against the government of [[Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia]] in August 1978. The unrest began with demonstrations against rising prices public transportation but then became widespread due to the bad economic situation the country was in at the time. Burning of buses, blockades and massive protests that resulted in destruction of public infrastructure occurred almost every day. The government responded with three thousand Army soldiers, whom supported by light armored forces and the riot squad of the National Police, were deployed in central and peripheral areas of the city. Also, the night of 3 September 1985 the University of San Carlos of Guatemala was occupied by the military who allegedly found an underground shooting range subversive propaganda.&lt;ref name=elpais85/&gt;

Several hundred people were arrested and General Mejia Víctores addressed the nation through a television and radio address in which he announced measures to address prevailing social unrest. General Mejia announced public schools closure until further notice and the freezing of prices of consumer goods;&lt;ref name=elpais85&gt;{{harvnb|El País|1985|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the end, as part of the process solution a high school student bonus was granted to both elementary and high schools so they could be transported free in public transportation, plus all the public school students were promoted by decree. Students who graduated by decree in 1985 were received with brutal initiations by the different student bodies through the University.&lt;ref name=elpais85/&gt;

==== Constitution of 1985: Election of judges and university representatives before government institutions====

{{Quote box|align=right|width=400px|Article 215. Election of the Supreme Court&lt;br/&gt;.

The judges of the Supreme Court shall be elected by [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]] for a period of five years, from a list of twenty-six candidates proposed by a nominating committee consisting of a representative of the Presidents of the Universities of the country, who presides, the Deans of the Colleges of Law, an equal number of representatives elected by the General Assembly of the Association of Lawyers and Notaries of Guatemala and by an equal number of representatives elected by the judges holders the Court of Appeal and other courts that Article 217 of the Constitution refers to.

|Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala, 1985.{{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|p=169}}}}

After the murder or forced exile of most of its faculty, the stability of the College of Law after the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] was recovered with deanship of Cipriano Soto Tobar, who took office in 1988. Soto Tobar took a significant effort on hiring faculty. However, his main goal was to establishg political networks to favor political lobbies exploiting the new role that the Constitution assigned to the University of San Carlos:&lt;ref name=veliz&gt;{{cite web|last=Véliz|first=Rodrigo|url=https://nomada.gt/que-hicieron-los-profesores-de-derecho-para-que-la-usac-perdiera-prestigio/|title=¿Qué hizo Derecho para que la USAC perdiera prestigio?|year=2014|location=Guatemala|website=Nómada|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, enacted in 1985, entrusted the College of Law and the University of San Carlos with the task of naming representatives to the process of election of judges of the highest courts of the land,{{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|pp=169-170}} as well as the Comptroller General of Accounts,{{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|pp=180-181}} and the Chief Public Prosecutor {{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|p=197}} Also, the University was given the power to send a judge to the Constitutionality Court.{{sfn|Dighero Herrera|2002|p=214}}

These networks took hold and strengthened thru the nineties setting up relationships with institutions and society sectors that were not associated as a university. After leaving the deanship, the University Council nominated Soto to the Constitutionality Court, although there were persistent rumors that he was selling diplomas and certificates. However, his application was accepted because his involvement in these felonies could not be proved because no credible evidence was presented.{{sfn|Hernández Pico|2001|p =}} Two of his performances in the Constitutionality Court showed possible political compromise: first, he voted to validate an illegal adoption network and, then he voted in favor of the registration as a presidential candidate of general [[Efraín Ríos Montt]], despite the prohibition of the 1985 Constitution, which does not allowed as a candidate anybody that had been part of a coup d'état.{{sfn|Castillo Zamora|2013|p=}} In those years, adoption networks operating in Guatemala could collect up to US$60,000 per child and went from delivering 1200 children in 1997 to more than four thousand in 2004.&lt;ref name=veliz/&gt;

Estuardo Galvez, who took that Dean office in 2000 -and later went on to become university president, was one of the members of the networks established by Soto; realizing the importance of the Bar Association, which was also a participant in the election of judges -and until then controlled by lawyers linked to the traditional capital of the country- Galvez sought from the beginning of his term to favor his post graduate students placing them in public institutions so that they could show their loyalty with favorable votes in the Bar elections.&lt;ref name=veliz/&gt; After several elections, and once Galvez was no longer Dean, the network that Soto set up beat the traditional capital lawyers in the Bar Association elections by 300 votes; as recorded in the minutes, the majority of his votes were young lawyers -his former students.&lt;ref name=veliz/&gt;

==== Student leaders murders in 1989====

In 1987, the president of the Student Association "El Derecho" (AED), Willy Ligorría, was expelled from the Association of University Students (AEU) for embezzling funds from the [[Huelga de Dolores]] Committee, for his direct involvement in an embezzlement money of the association and usurpation of functions and for signing as acting as General Secretary in various activities and international documents.&lt;ref name=rehmi89/&gt; After his departure, a series of death threats against members of the board of the AEU began: in 1989 there was a steady escalation of threats, some of them signed by death squads as "the Dolorosa", the "Jaguar of Justice" or "Secret Anticommunist-Army". Despite his expulsion, Ligorría, maintained a very high and combative profile, while his close friend, Marco Tulio Montenegro, was still part of AEU.&lt;ref name=rehmi89&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.derechoshumanos.net/lesahumanidad/informes/guatemala/informeREMHI-Tomo2.htm#t2c3-m20|author=Informe REMHI|journal=Fundación Acción Pro-Derechos Humanos|title=Proyecto Interdiocesano de Recuperación de la Memoria Histórica |year=n.d.|accessdate=23 October 2013|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, several student body leaders returned to Guatemala from exile intending to achieve a resurgence of student coordination, which was practically dismantled since the seventies. But on August 21, Iván Ernesto Gonzalez was arrested and kinapped; the next day, Carlos Contreras Conde, leader of the University Student Movement (MEU), was abducted near the university. That same day Hugo Leonel Gramajo was abducted and introduced in a red pick-up with foreign plates. On 23 August, Victor Hugo Rodriguez Jaramillo and Silvia Azurdia Utrera founders of MEU, were kidnapped and taken violenty amid two cars that blocked their way. And Mario De León left a press conference that the Student Body held that day at around 19:45 hours and was detained by the National Police and has not been seen again since.&lt;ref name=rehmi89/&gt; Finally, Aaron Ochoa disappeared the next day.

During an emergency meeting in which the response to the government offensive was being discussed, Willy Ligorría called to say that he knew where Hugo Gramajo and Aaron Ochoa were hidden and that he could bring the still free student leaders to them. In September other members of the student movement, Carlos Chutá Carney, Carlos Humberto Cabrera and Carlos Palencia were kidnapped and found dead shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=rehmi89/&gt;

After the murders of the student leaders, Ligorría spoke at some rallies in college and participated in the demonstrations that took place.  On Saturday September 15 at 14:15 hours he left for Panamá along with Marco Tulio Montenegro and Byron Milian Vicente. Montenegro returned to Guatemala on 11 November 1989 to rejoin the AEU, but he was already a suspect, and was killed with knife soon after. Meanwhile, Ligorría was appointed Head of Research of Public Prosecutions.&lt;ref name=rehmi89/&gt;&lt;ref group = lower-alpha&gt;According to research that was subsequently conducted, it was determined that Ligorría had strong ties with a "gang" of zone 18, whose members went armed at all times; College students suspected that the "maras" had been formed by the army. Ligorría was also affiliated with the Democratic Socialist Party (PSD) and even wasted money in their university activities, although he always maintained a revolutionary speech, was a member of ORPA and maintained contact with Danilo Rodriguez, chief of the FAR.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, 1997, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, which became a political party after the peace accords, formally accused Ligorría for his involvement in the murder of the student leader, claiming that he was a member of military intelligence.

The '''University of California Observatories''' (UCO) is a multi-campus astronomical research unit of the [[University of California]], with headquarters on the [[UC Santa Cruz]] campus. UCO operates the [[Lick Observatory]] on [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]], and the technical labs at UC Santa Cruz and [[UCLA]]. UCO is also a managing partner of the [[W. M. Keck Observatory]] in [[Hawaii]], and the center for the UC participation in the [[Thirty-Meter Telescope]] (TMT) project.

UCO was founded in 1988 to recognize the expansion of responsibilities of the Lick Observatory Headquarters to include managing the UC share of the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.

==Leadership==
The first UCO Director was [[Robert Kraft (astronomer)|Dr. Robert Kraft]], who transitioned from his position as the Lick Observatory Director at the founding of UCO. Kraft was responsible for guiding the development of the UC role in the W.M. Keck Observatory and the partnership in Keck with Caltech. In 1991, Dr. Joe Miller became the second UCO Director and oversaw the successful completion of the two 10-meter Keck Telescopes and the initial UC Keck instruments. In 2005 Miller stepped down and [[Michael Bolte|Dr. Michael Bolte]] became the UCO interim Director. In 2006 Bolte became the UCO Director and served till 2012. [[Sandra Faber|Dr. Sandra Faber]] was Interim Director for 2013/2014, Dr. [[Claire Max]] Interim Director in 2015 and Dr. Claire Max became Director in 2016.

==Instrumentation Program==
A number of instruments and adaptive optics systems have been built at the UC Observatories labs in UC Santa Cruz and UCLA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35709">: ''This article is about urban history as a subject. See [[history of the city]] for a chronological description of cities.''
'''Urban history''' is a field of [[history]] that examines the historical nature of [[city|cities]] and [[town]]s, and the process of [[urbanization]]. The approach is often multidisciplinary, crossing boundaries into fields like [[social history]], [[architectural history]], [[urban sociology]], [[urban geography]], [[business history]], and [[archaeology]]. [[Urbanization]] and [[industrialization]] were popular themes for 20th-century historians, often tied to an implicit model of [[modernization]], or the transformation of rural traditional societies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch,  "American urban history as an example of recent historiography." ''History and Theory'' (1979): 350-377. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2504535 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of urbanization focuses on the processes of by which existing populations concentrate themselves in [[Urban area|urban localities]] over time, and on the social, political, cultural and economic contexts of cities. Most urban scholars focus on the "metropolis," a large or especially important city.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Keene, "Ideas of the metropolis," ''Historical Research'' (2011) 84#225 pp 379-398.&lt;/ref&gt; There is much less attention to small cities, towns or (until recently) to suburbs. However social historians find small cities much easier to handle because they can use census data to cover or sample the entire population.  In the United States from the 1920s to the 1990s many of the most influential monographs began as one of the 140 PhD dissertations at Harvard University directed by [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]] (1888-1965) or [[Oscar Handlin]] (1915-2011).&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Stave, ed., ''The Making of Urban History: Historiography through Oral History'' (1977) [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0803908687 in Google]&lt;/ref&gt;  The field grew rapidly after 1970, leading one prominent scholar, [[Stephan Thernstrom]], to note that urban history apparently deals with cities, or with city-dwellers, or with events that transpired in cities, with attitudes toward cities – which makes one wonder what is ''not'' urban history.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mohl, "The History of the American City," in William H. Cartwright and Richard L.  Watson Jr. eds., ''Reinterpretation of American History and Culture'' (1973)  pp 165-205 quote p 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparative studies==
Only a handful of studies attempt a global history of cities, notably [[Lewis Mumford]], ''[[The City in History]]'' (1961).&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Paul Bairoch]], ''Cities and Economic Development, From the Dawn of History to the Present'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;  Representative comparative studies include Leonardo Benevolo, ''The European City'' (1993);  Christopher R. Friedrichs, ''The Early Modern City, 1450-1750'' (1995), and James L. McClain, John M. Merriman, and Ugawa Kaoru. eds. ''Edo and Paris'' (1994) (Edo was the old name for Tokyo).&lt;ref&gt;They are reviewed in Wolfgang Reinhard, "New Contributions to Comparative Urban History," ''[[Journal of Early Modern History]]'' (1997) 1#2 pp 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural history is its own field, but occasionally overlaps with urban history.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Spiro Kostof]], ''The City Shaped: Urban Patterns and Meanings Through History'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The political role of cities in helping state formation—and in staying independent—is the theme of [[Charles Tilly]] and [[W. P. Blockmans]], eds., ''Cities and the Rise of States in Europe, A.D. 1000 to 1800'' (1994).  Comparative elite studies—who was in power—are typified by Luisa Passerini, Dawn Lyon, Enrica Capussotti and Ioanna Laliotou, eds. ''Who Ran the Cities? City Elites and Urban Power Structures in Europe and North America, 1750-1940'' (2008) .&lt;ref&gt;See also Frederic Cople Jaher, ''The Urban Establishment: Upper Strata in Boston, New York, Charleston, Chicago, and Los Angeles'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  Labor activists and socialists often had national or international networks that circulated ideas and tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton Stromquist, "'Thinking globally; acting locally': Municipal Labour and Socialist Activism in Comparative Perspective, 1890–1920," ''Labour History Review'' (2009) 74#3 pp 233-256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Britain==
{{Main|Historiography of the United Kingdom#Urban history}}
In the 1960s, the historiography of Victorian towns and cities began to flourish in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Gary W. Davies, "The rise of urban history in Britain c. 1960-1978" (PhD dissertation, University of Leicester, 2014) [https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/29036/1/2014daviesgwphd.pdf online, wWillith detailed bibliography pp 205-40]&lt;/ref&gt; Much attention focused first on the Victorian city, with topics ranging from demography, public health, the working-class, and local culture.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Dyos, and Michael Wolff, eds. ''Victorian City: Images and Realities'' (2 vol. 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, topics regarding class, capitalism, and social structure gave way to studies of the cultural history of urban life, as well as the study of groups such as women, prostitutes, migrants from rural areas, and immigrants from the Continent and from the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Myers and Ian Grosvenor, "Birmingham Stories: Local Histories of Migration and Settlement and the Practice of History." ''Midland History'' (2011) 36#2 pp 149-162&lt;/ref&gt; The urban environment itself became a major topic, as studies of the material fabric of the city, and the structure of urban space, became more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Gunn, "Urbanization" in Chris Williams, ed., ''Eight Companion to 19th-Century Britain'' (2007) pp 238-252&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have almost always focused on London, but they have also studied small towns and cities from the medieval period, as well as the urbanization that attended the industrial revolution. In the second half of the 19th century, provincial centers such as Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, and Manchester doubled in size, and became regional capitals. They were all conurbations that included smaller cities and suburbs in their [[catchment area]]. Available scholarly materials have become quite comprehensive today.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Palliser,  Peter Clark, and Martin Daunton, eds. ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain'' (3 vol 2000), which reaches down to 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban biography==
Urban biography is the narrative history of a city, and often reaches a general audience. Urban biographies cover the interrelationships among various dimensions, such as politics, demography, business, high culture, popular culture, housing, neighborhoods, and ethnic groups.  It covers [[municipal government]] as well as physical expansion, growth and decline.  Historians often focus on the largest and most dominant city—usually the national capital—which geographers call a "[[primate city]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garrett Nagle|title=Advanced Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cq9uFL07Y6wC&amp;pg=PA291|year=2000|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some representative urban biographies are:
* [[Edwin G. Burrows]] and [[Mike Wallace (historian)|Mike Wallace]]. ''Gotham: a history of New York City to 1898'' (2000)
* [[S. G. Checkland]], ''The Upas Tree: Glasgow, 1875-1975'' (1981)
* Geoffrey Cotterell, ''Amsterdam, The Life of a City'' (1972)
* [[Janet Abu-Lughod]], ''Cairo; 1001 Years of City Victorious'' (1971)
* Diane E. Davis, ''Urban Leviathan: Mexico City in the Twentieth Century'' (1994)
* [[Christopher Hibbert]], ''London, the Biography of a City'' (1969)
* [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], ''Barcelona'' (1992)
* [[Colin Jones (historian)|Colin Jones]]. ''Paris: Biography of a City'' (2004)
* Blake McKelvey. ''Rochester'' (4 vol, 1961), [[History of Rochester, New York|Rochester NY]]
* [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], ''Jerusalem: The Biography'' (2012)
* [[Bessie Louise Pierce]], ''A History of Chicago'' (3 vol 1957), to 1893.
* [[Roy Porter]], ''London: A Social History'' (1998)
* Alexandra Ritchie, ''Faust's Metropolis: A History of Berlin'' (1998)
* James Scobie, ''Buenos Aires: Plaza to Suburb'' (1974)
* Ronald Taylor, ''Berlin and its Culture: A Historical Portrait'' (1997),  considers literature, music, theater, painting, and decorative arts.

Historians have developed typologies of cities, emphasizing their geographic location and economic specialization. In the United States [[Carl Bridenbaugh]] was a pioneer in the historiography.  He emphasized the major port cities on the East Coast, the largest of which were Boston and Philadelphia, each with fewer than 40,000 people at the time of the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in the Wilderness: The First Century of Urban Life in America, 1625-1742'' (1938), and ''Cities in Revolt: Urban Life in America, 1743-1776'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other historians have covered the port cities up and down the East Coast, the Gulf Coast, and the West Coast, along with the river ports along the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri rivers. Industrialization began in New England, and several small cities have scholarly histories. The railroad cities of the West, stretching from Chicago to Kansas City to Wichita to Denver have been well treated. Blake McKelvey provides an encyclopedic overview of the functions of major cities in ''The Urbanization of America, 1860-1915'' (1963), and ''The Emergence of Metropolitan America, 1915-1966'' (1968)

==Large scale reference books==
Peter Clark of the Urban History Center of the University of Leicester was the general editor (and Cambridge University Press the publisher) of a massive history of British cities and towns, running 2800 pages in 75 chapters by 90 scholars.  The chapters deal not with biographies of individual cities, but with economic, social or political themes that cities had in common.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Palliser, ed., ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain, vol. I, 600-1540'' (2000); P. A. Clark, ed., ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain vol. II, 1540-1840''; M. J. Daunton, ed., ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain, vol. III, 1840 1950.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See review by: Albert J. Schmidt, ''Journal of Social History'' (2003) 36#3 pp. 781-784 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3790746 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Two highly influential, authoritative and comprehensive compendia of European urban history were also compiled by Barry Haynes of the Centre for Urban History at Leicester University in 1990 and 1991, published by Leicester University. These books made a significant contribution to the bibliographic review of urban history research and literature in both Eastern and Western Europe.

In the United States a very different approach was sponsored by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] has sponsored large historical encyclopedias for many states and several cities, most notably the [[Encyclopedia of Chicago]] (2004; also online edition) and  [[The Encyclopedia of New York City]] (1995, 2nd ed. 2010) They followed the model of an earlier encyclopedia of Cleveland&lt;ref&gt;David D. Van Tassel and , John J. Brabowski, eds., ''The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and relished the details about neighborhoods, people, organizations and events, without imposing any overall theme.

===Suburbs===
{{main|Suburb}}
A new subgenre is the history of specific suburbs.  Historians have concentrated on specific places, typically focusing on the origins of the suburb in relation to the central city, the pattern of growth, different functions (such as residential or industrial), local politics, as well as racial exclusion and gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth McManus and Philip J. Ethington, "Suburbs in transition: new approaches to suburban history," ''Urban History'' (2007) 34#2 pp 317-337&lt;/ref&gt; The main overview is [[Kenneth T. Jackson]]'s ''[[Crabgrass Frontier]]'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people have assumed that early-20th-century suburbs were enclaves for middle-class whites, a concept that carries tremendous cultural influence yet is actually stereotypical. Many suburbs are based on a heterogeneous society of working-class and minority residents, many of whom share the [[American Dream]] of upward social status via home ownership. Sies (2001) argues that it is necessary to examine how "suburb" is defined as well as the distinction made between cities and suburbs, geography, economic circumstances, and the interaction of numerous factors that move research beyond acceptance of stereotyping and its influence on scholarly assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Corbin Sies, "North American Suburbs, 1880-1950," ''Journal of Urban History,'' March 2001, Vol. 27 Issue 3, pp 313-46&lt;/ref&gt;

==New urban history==
The "new urban history" emerged in the 1960s as a branch of [[Social history]] seeking to understand the "city as process" and, through quantitative methods, to learn more about the inarticulate masses in the cities, as opposed to the mayors and elites. Much of the attention is devoted to individual behavior, and how the intermingling of classes and ethnic groups operated inside a particular city. Smaller cities are much easier to handle when it comes to tracking a sample of individuals over ten or 20 years.

Common themes include the social and political changes, examinations of class formation, and racial/ethnic tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom and Richard Sennett, eds. ''Nineteenth-century Cities: Essays in the New Urban History'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;   A major early study was Stephan Thernstrom's ''Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century City'' (1964), which used census records to study [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], 1850-1880. A seminal, landmark book, it sparked interest in the 1960s and 1970s in quantitative methods, census sources,  "bottom-up" history, and the measurement of upward social mobility by different ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch, "''Poverty and Progress:'' A Paradoxical Legacy," ''Social Science History,'' Spring 1986, Vol. 10 Issue 1, pp 15-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Other exemplars of the new urban history included
*Kathleen Conzen,  ''Immigrant Milwaukee, 1836-1860'' (1976)
* David F. Crew. '' Town in the Ruhr: A Social History of Bochum, 1860-1914'' (1986)
* Alan Dawley, ''Class and Community: The Industrial Revolution in Lynn'' (1975; 2nd ed. 2000)
* Michael B. Katz,  ''The People of Hamilton, Canada West'' (1976)&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.amazon.com/dp/159740411X excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Eric Henry Monkkonen|Eric H. Monkkonen]], ''The Dangerous Class: Crime and Poverty in Columbus Ohio 1860-1865'' (1975)

There were no overarching social history theories that emerged developed to explain urban development. Inspiration from urban geography and sociology, as well as a concern with workers (as opposed to labor union leaders), families, ethnic groups, racial segregation, and women's roles have proven useful&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, R., 1991. History, geography, and historical geography. Social Science History, 15(2), pp.265-288.&lt;/ref&gt;. Historians now view the contending groups within the city as "agents" who shape the direction of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Marsh and Lizabeth Cohen. "Old Forms, New Visions: New Directions in United States Urban History," ''Pennsylvania History,'' Winter 1992, Vol. 59 Issue 1, pp 21-28&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-field has flourished in Australia—where most people live in cities.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Frost, and Seamus O'Hanlon, "Urban History and the Future of Australian Cities," ''Australian Economic History Review'' March 2009, Vol. 49 Issue 1, pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic perspectives make use of the large volume of census data from the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lampard, ''The Urbanizing World,'' in [[H. J. Dyos]] and Michael Wolff, eds., The Victorian City: Images and Realities, vol. 1 (1973), pp.&amp;nbsp;3–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James H. Jackson, Jr.. "Alltagsgeschichte, Social Science History and the Study of Mundane Movements in 19th-Century Germany," ''Historical Social Research'' (1991) 16#1 pp23-47, explains the value of employment records, marriage contracts, vital records and continuous residency registers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than being strictly areas of geographical segmentation, spatial patterns and concepts of place reveal the struggles for power of various social groups, including gender, class, race, and ethnic identity&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307 &lt;/ref&gt;. The spatial patterns of residential and business areas give individual cities their distinct identities and, considering the social aspects attendant to the patterns, create a more complete picture of how those cities evolved, shaping the lives of their citizens.&lt;ref&gt;James Connolly, "Bringing the City Back in: Space and Place in the Urban History of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era," ''Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era,'' July 2002, Vol. 1 Issue 3, pp 258-278.  The importance of the materiality of specific spaces and places is also treated in Ralph Kingston, "[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/berg/cash/2010/00000007/00000001/art00006 Mind over Matter? History and the Spatial Turn]," ''Cultural and Social History,'' 2010, Vol. 7, Issue 1, pp. 111–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

New techniques include the use of historical [[Geographic information system|GIS]]  data.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Gordon, "Lost in space, or confessions of an accidental geographer,"''[[International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing]]'' (2011) 5#1 pp 1-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Western cities==
Since the 1980s extensive research has been done of the cities of the Ottoman Empire, where standardized record keeping and centralized archives have facilitated work on [[Aleppo]], [[Damascus]], [[Byblos]], [[Sidon]], [[Jericho]], [[Hama]], [[Nablus]] and [[Jerusalem]]. Historians have explored the social bases of political factionalism, histories of elites and commoners, different family structures and gender roles, marginalized groups such as prostitutes and slaves, and relationships between Muslims and Christians and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Reilly, "Ottoman Syria: Social History Through an Urban Lens," ''History Compass'' (2012) 10#1 pp 70-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly work is underway on African cities,&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Fourchard, "Between World History and State Formation: New Perspectives On Africa's Cities," ''Journal of African History'' (2011) 52#2 pp 223-248.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Burton, ed., ''Urban History in Africa: The Urban Experience in Eastern Africa c. 1750–2000'' (Nairobi: The British Institute in Eastern Africa, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Sharif Uddin Ahmed, ed., ''Dhaka: Past, Present, Future'' (1991) is Bangladesh history from an urban planning perspective&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Heitzman, "Middle Towns to Middle Cities in South Asia, 1800-2007," ''Journal of Urban History'' (2008) 35#1 pp 15-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China the Maoist ideology privileged the uprising of the peasants as the central force in Chinese history, which led to a neglect of urban history until the 1980s. Academics were then allowed to assert that peasant rebellions were often reactionary rather than revolutionary, and that China's modernizers of the 1870s made significant advances, even if they were capitalists.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Buck "The Study of Urban History in the People's Republic of China," ''Urban History Yearbook'' (1987), pp 61-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Stave, "A Conversation with Zhou Lei: Urban History and Development in Beijing (Peking)," ''Journal of Urban History'' (1988) 14#2 pp 254-68&lt;/ref&gt;

For over a century—since [[Heinrich Schliemann]] searched for and found ancient Troy&lt;ref&gt;David A. Traill, ''Schliemann of Troy: Treasure and Deceit'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;—archaeologists and ancient historians have studies the cities of the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;See  [[Marc van de Mieroop]] ''The Ancient Mesopotamian City.'' (Oxford University Press, 1999) and John Hyslop, ''Inka Settlement Planning''. (U. of Texas Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Images and cultural role==
The study of the culture of specific cities and the role of cities in shaping national culture is a more recent development which provides nontraditional ways of "reading" cities. A representative class is Carl E. Schorske, ''Fin-De-Siecle Vienna: Politics and Culture'' (1980).  The basis for some of this approach stems from a [[post-modern]] theory including the cultural anthropology of [[Clifford Geertz]]. One example is Alan Mayne's ''The Imagined Slum: Newspaper Representation in Three Cities, 1870-1914''(1993), a study of how slums were represented in the newspapers in [[Sydney]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Birmingham]]. The accounts provided dramatic life stories but failed to integrate the agendas and animosities of city officials, property owners, residents, and local businessmen.  As a result, they did not reveal the true inner-city social structures.  Nevertheless, the middle class accepted the image of and decided to act on the [[social construction]]s, leading to the reformers' demands for [[slum clearance]] and [[urban renewal]].&lt;ref&gt;See also Alan Mayne, "  Representing The Slum," ''Urban History Yearbook'' (1990), Vol. 17, pp 66-84&lt;/ref&gt;

As Rosen and Tarr point out, environmental history has made great strides since the 1970s, but its focus is primarily on rural areas, leading to a neglect of urban issues such as air pollution, sewage, clean water—and the concentration of large numbers of horses.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Meisn Rosen, and Joel Arthur Tarr, "The importance of an urban perspective in environmental history," ''Journal of Urban History'' (1994) 20#3 pp 299-310&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians are beginning to integrate urban history and environmental history.&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Massard-Guilbaud, and Peter Thorsheim, "Cities, Environments, and European History," ''Journal of Urban History'' (2007) 33#5 pp 691-701, introduces a special issue with case studies from Austria, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far most of the attention concerns the negative impact on the environment, rather than how the environment shaped the urbanization process.&lt;ref&gt;Lezlie Morinière, "Environmentally Influenced Urbanisation: Footprints Bound for Town?" ''Urban Studies'' (2012) 49#2 pp 435-450, examines 147 studies&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature and philosophy===
In literature the city has long stood as one of the most potent symbols of human capacities and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Schorske, "The Idea of the City in European Thought: Voltaire to Spengler," in ''The Historian and the City'', ed. Oscar Handlin and John Burchard (Harvard U.P., 1963)&lt;/ref&gt; As the largest and most enduring creation of human imagination and hands, and as the largest and most sustained site of human association and interaction, the city has been seen as a marker of what humans are and of what they do. This signification has almost always been shaded with ambivalence. In old legends, epics, and utopias, cities (both actual and symbolic) appeared as places of exceptional but also contradictory meaning. The histories of Troy, Babel, Sodom, Babylon, and Rome were viewed, in Western cultures, as standing for human power, wisdom, creativity, and vision, but also for human presumption, perversion, and fated destruction. Images of the modern city restated this ambivalence with fresh intensity. Great modern cities like London, Paris, Berlin, and New York, have repeatedly been portrayed as sites of opportunity and peril, power and helplessness, vitality and decadence, creativity and perplexity. This contradictory face of the city has appeared so often in Western thought as to suggest an essential psychological and cultural anxiety about human civilization, an anxiety about humanity’s relation to their created world and about "humanity" itself. This is especially true of the “modern” city, filled with human artifice and moral contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;See also Lewis Mumford, "Utopia, The City, and The Machine," ''Daedalus'' (Spring 1965): 271-92; Philip Fisher, "City Matters: City Minds," ''The Worlds of Victorian Fiction'', ed.

==Scholarship==
The [[Journal of Urban History]] has been a leading quarterly journal with articles and reviews since 1975. The Urban History Association was founded in 1988 with 284 members; it now has over 400. It sponsored the "Sixth Biennial Urban History Association Conference" in New York, October 25–28, 2012. It awards prizes for the best book prize, best article, and best PhD dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://uha.udayton.edu/ UHA website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312054102/http://uha.udayton.edu/ |date=2015-03-12 }}; its semiannual [http://uha.udayton.edu/news.html newsletters are online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold James Dyos|H.J. Dyos]]  (1921-1978) at the University of Leicester was the leading promoter of urban history in Britain, leading the way especially into the study of Victorian cities.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos, ''Exploring the Urban Past: Essays in Urban History'' edited by David Cannadine and David Reeder (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  He formed the Urban History Study Group in 1962; its newsletter became the ''Urban History Yearbook'' (1974-1991) and then the journal ''Urban History'' (1992–present).  His edited volume on ''The Study of Urban History'' (1968) opened up the methodology and stimulated young scholars, as did the conferences he organized and the book series he edited.  Dyos rejected the quantitative methods of the New Urban History because he was not interested in the individual people in the city, but in the larger social structure, such as the slum or the entire city.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour J. Mandelbaum, "H. J. Dyos and British Urban History," ''The Economic History Review'' (1985)  38#3 pp. 437–447, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2596999 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1993, the daily email discussion list '''H-Urban'''  has enabled historians, graduate students and others interested in urban history and urban studies to communicate current research and research interests easily; to query and discuss new approaches, sources, methods, and tools of analysis; and to comment on contemporary historiography. The logs are open to searches, and membership is free. H-Urban seeks to inform historians on such matters as announcements, calls for papers, conferences, awards, fellowships, availability of new sources and archives, reports on new research, and teaching tools, including books, articles, works-in-progress, research reports, primary historical documents (for example, model ordinances, federal/state/local reports, addresses of city officials), syllabi, bibliographies, software, datasets, and multimedia publications or projects. It commissions its own book reviews. H-Urban has 2,856 subscribers (as of 2012) and is the oldest of the H-Net network of discussion lists.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://langinnovate.msu.edu/~urban/ H-Urban website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''veneration of the dead''', including one's [[ancestors]], is based on love and respect for the deceased. In some cultures, it is related to [[belief]]s that the dead have a [[afterlife|continued existence]], and may possess the ability to influence the fortune of the living. Some groups venerate their direct, familial ancestors. Certain sects and religions, in particular the [[Roman Catholic Church]], venerate [[saint]]s as [[Intercession|intercessors with God]], as well as pray for [[Soul|departed souls]] in [[Purgatory]].

In [[Culture of Europe|Europe]], [[Culture of Asia|Asia]], and [[Oceania]], and in some [[Culture of Africa|African]] and [[Afro-American religion|Afro-diasporic]] cultures, the goal of ancestor [[veneration]] is to ensure the ancestors' continued well-being and positive disposition towards the living, and sometimes to ask for special favours or assistance. The social or non-religious function of ancestor veneration is to cultivate [[kinship]] values, such as [[filial piety]], family loyalty, and continuity of the [[Kinship#Descent and the family|family lineage]]. Ancestor veneration occurs in societies with every degree of social, political, and technological complexity, and it remains an important component of various [[religious]] practices in modern times.

==Overview==
Ancestor reverence is not the same as the [[worship]] of a [[deity]] or deities. In some Afro-diasporic cultures, ancestors are seen as being able to intercede on behalf of the living, often as messengers between humans and the gods. As spirits who were once human themselves, they are seen as being better able to understand human needs than would a divine being. In other cultures, the purpose of ancestor veneration is not to ask for favors but to do one's filial duty. Some cultures believe that their ancestors actually need to be provided for by their descendants, and their practices include offerings of food and other provisions. Others do not believe that the ancestors are even aware of what their descendants do for them, but that the expression of [[filial piety]] is what is important.

Most cultures who practice ancestor veneration do not call it "ancestor worship". In [[English language|English]], the word ''worship'' usually refers to the reverent love and [[Loyalty|devotion]] accorded a deity (god) or [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/worship |title=worship |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/learner/worship |title=worship |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/worship |title=worship |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other cultures, this act of worship does not confer any belief that the departed ancestors have become some kind of deity. Rather, the act is a way to respect, honor and look after ancestors in their afterlives as well as seek their guidance for their living descendants. In this regard, many cultures and religions have similar practices. Some may visit the graves of their parents or other ancestors, leave flowers and pray to them in order to honor and remember them, while also asking their ancestors to continue to look after them. However, this would not be considered as worshipping them since the term ''worship'' shows no such meaning.

In that sense the phrase ''ancestor veneration'' may convey a more accurate sense of what practitioners, such as the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and other [[Buddhism|Buddhist-influenced]] and [[Confucianism|Confucian-influenced]] societies, as well as the African and European cultures see themselves as doing. This is consistent with the meaning of the word ''[[veneration]]'' in English, that is great respect or reverence caused by the dignity, wisdom, or dedication of a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/venerate |title=venerate |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/veneration |title=veneration |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/veneration |title=veneration |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is no generally accepted theory concerning the origins of ancestor veneration, this social phenomenon appears in some form in all human cultures documented so far. David-Barrett and Carney claim that ancestor veneration might have served a group coordination role during [[human evolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The deification of historical figures and the emergence of priesthoods as a solution to a network coordination problem|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|journal = Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date = 2015-08-14|issn = 2153-599X|pages = 1–11|volume = 0|issue = 0|doi = 10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|first = Tamás|last = Dávid-Barrett|first2 = James|last2 = Carney}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus it was the mechanism that led to religious representation fostering [[group cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modes of Religiosity.

==Ancient Egypt==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

Although some historians claim that ancient Egyptian society was a "death cult" because of its elaborate tombs and [[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices|mummification rituals]], it was the opposite.  The philosophy that "this world is but a [[vale of tears]]" and that to die and be with God is a better existence than an earthly one was relatively unknown among the ancient Egyptians.  This was not to say that they were unacquainted with the harshness of life; rather, their ethos included a sense of continuity between this life and the next.  The Egyptian people loved the culture, customs and religion of their daily lives so much that they wanted to continue them in the next—although some might hope for a better station in the Beautiful West (Egyptian afterlife).

[[Tomb]]s were housing in the Hereafter and so they were carefully constructed and decorated, just as homes for the living were.  Mummification was a way to preserve the corpse so the ''[[Ka (Egyptian soul)|ka]]'' (soul) of the deceased could return to receive offerings of the things s/he enjoyed while alive.  If mummification was not affordable, a "ka-statue" in the likeness of the deceased was carved for this purpose.  The Blessed Dead were collectively called the ''[[akh]]u'', or "shining ones" (singular: ''akh'').  They were described as "shining as gold in the belly of Nut" (Gr. [[Nuit]]) and were indeed depicted as golden stars on the roofs of many tombs and temples.

The process by which a ''ka'' became an ''akh'' was not automatic upon death; it involved a 70-day journey through the ''[[duat]]'', or Otherworld, which led to [[Divine judgment|judgment]] before Wesir (Gr. [[Osiris]]), Lord of the Dead where the ''ka’''s heart would be weighed on a scale against the Feather of [[Ma’at]] (representing Truth).  However, if the ''ka'' was not properly prepared, this journey could be fraught with dangerous pitfalls and strange demons; hence some of the earliest religious texts discovered, such as the [[Papyrus of Ani]] (commonly known as [[The Book of the Dead]]) and the [[Pyramid Texts]] were actually written as guides to help the deceased successfully navigate the ''duat''.

If the heart was in balance with the Feather of Ma'at, the ''ka'' passed judgment and was granted access to the Beautiful West as an ''akh'' who was ''ma’a heru'' ("true of voice") to dwell among the gods and other ''akhu''.  At this point only was the ''ka'' deemed worthy to be venerated by the living through rites and offerings.  Those who became lost in the ''duat'' or deliberately tried to avoid judgment became the unfortunate (and sometimes dangerous) ''mutu'', the Restless Dead.  For the few whose truly evil hearts outweighed the Feather, the goddess [[Ammit]] waited patiently behind Wesir’s judgment seat to consume them. She was a composite creature resembling three of the deadliest animals in Egypt: the crocodile, the hippopotamus and the lion. Being fed to Ammit was to be consigned to the Eternal Void, to be "unmade" as a ''ka''.

Besides being eaten by Ammit, the worst fate a ''ka'' could suffer after physical death was to be forgotten.  For this reason, ancestor veneration in [[ancient Egypt]] was an important rite of remembrance in order to keep the ''ka'' "alive" in this life as well as in the next.  Royals, nobles and the wealthy made contracts with their local [[priest]]s to perform prayers and give offerings at their tombs.  In return, the priests were allowed to keep a portion of the offerings as payment for services rendered.  Some [[Maat#Maat in Funerary Texts (The Book of Coming Forth by Day and on tomb inscriptions)|tomb inscriptions]] even invited passers-by to speak aloud the names of the deceased within (which also helped to perpetuate their memory), and to offer water, prayers or other things if they so desired.  In the private homes of the less wealthy, niches were carved into the walls for the purpose of housing images of familial ''akhu'' and to serve as altars of veneration.

Many of these same religious beliefs and ancestor veneration practices are still carried on today in the religion of [[Kemetic Orthodoxy]].

==Ancient Rome==
[[File:Sarcophagus death of Meleager Louvre Ma539.jpg|thumb|Detail from an early 2nd-century Roman [[sarcophagus]] depicting the death of [[Meleager]]]]

{{see also|Roman funerals and burial}}
The [[ancient Rome|Romans]], like many Mediterranean societies, regarded the bodies of the dead as polluting.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman, "Religious ''koine'' and Religious Dissent," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; During Rome's Classical period, the body was most often cremated, and the ashes placed in a tomb outside the city walls. Much of the month of February was devoted to purifications, propitiation, and veneration of the dead, especially at the nine-day [[Roman festivals|festival]] of the [[Parentalia]] during which a family honored its ancestors. The family visited the cemetery and shared cake and wine, both in the form of offerings to the dead and as a meal among themselves. The Parentalia drew to a close on February 21 with the more somber [[Feralia]], a public festival of sacrifices and offerings to the [[Manes]], the potentially malevolent spirits of the dead who required propitiation.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, "Religious ''Koine''," p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|inscriptional phrases]] on Latin epitaphs is ''Dis Manibus'', abbreviated ''D.M,'' "for the Manes gods", which appears even on [[:File:Stele Licinia Amias Terme 67646.jpg|some Christian tombstone]]s. The [[Caristia]] on February 22 was a celebration of the family line as it continued into the present.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908),  p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[nobiles|noble Roman family]] displayed ancestral images (''[[Roman funerals and burial#Funerary art|imagines]]'') in the tablinium of their home ''([[domus]])''. Some sources indicate these [[Roman portraiture|portraits]] were [[Roman sculpture|busts]], while others suggest that [[death mask|funeral masks]] were also displayed. The masks, probably modeled of wax from the face of the deceased, were part of the funeral procession when an elite Roman died. Professional mourners wore the masks and regalia of the dead person's ancestors as the body was carried from the home, through the streets, and to its final resting place.&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Lewis, "Imperial Autobiography, Augustus to Hadrian," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.34.1 (1993), p. 658.&lt;/ref&gt;

==West and Southeast African cultures==
Ancestor veneration is prevalent throughout Africa, and serves as the basis of many religions. It is often augmented by a belief in a supreme being, but prayers and/or sacrifices are usually offered to the ancestors who may ascend to becoming a kind of minor deities themselves. Ancestor veneration remains among many Africans, sometimes practiced alongside the later adopted religions of Christianity (as in Nigeria among the [[Igbo people]]), and Islam (among the different [[Mandé]] peoples and the [[Bamum people|Bamum]]) in much of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9hNKkzt1ovEC&amp;pg=PA412 |chapter=Ancestors as Elders in Africa |author=Igor Kopytoff |title=Perspectives on Africa: A Reader in Culture, History, and Representation |editor=[[Roy Richard Grinker]], Christopher Burghard Steiner |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=1997 |isbn=1-55786-686-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/fdtl/ancestors/fortes2.html Some reflections on ancestor workship in Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425103859/http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/Fdtl/Ancestors/fortes2.html |date=2009-04-25 }}, Meyer Fortes, ''African Systems of Thought'', pages 122-142, [[University of Kent]].&lt;/ref&gt; In orthodox [[Serer religion]], the [[pangool]] is venerated by the [[Serer people]].

The [[Serer people|Seereer people]] of Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania who adhere to the tenets of [[Serer religion|A ƭat Roog]] (Seereer religion) believe in the veneration of the [[pangool]] (ancient Seereer saints and/or ancestral spirits). There are various types of pangool (singular: ''fangol''), each with its own means of veneration.

Veneration of ancestors is prevalent throughout the island of [[Madagascar]]. Approximately half of the country's population of 20 million currently practice traditional religion,&lt;ref name=BGNote&gt;{{cite web|last=Bureau of African Affairs |title=Background Note: Madagascar |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=3 May 2011 |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5460.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61Be3ZCkK?url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5460.htm |archivedate=24 August 2011 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which tends to emphasize links between the living and the ''razana'' (ancestors). The veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the ''[[famadihana]]'', whereby a deceased family member's remains may be exhumed to be periodically re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere.  Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party, where food and rum are typically served and a [[hiragasy]] troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present.&lt;ref name=famadihana&gt;{{cite news|last=Bearak |first=Barry |title=Dead Join the Living in a Family Celebration |newspaper=New York Times |page=A7 |date=5 September 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/world/africa/06madagascar.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64fFKK5JL?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/world/africa/06madagascar.html |archivedate=13 January 2012 |accessdate=13 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Veneration of ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'', taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways, they may intervene on behalf of the living. Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of [[zebu]] is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors. Small, everyday gestures of respect include throwing the first capful of a newly opened bottle of rum into the northeast corner of the room to give the ancestors their due share.&lt;ref name=Bradtbeliefs&gt;Bradt (2011), pp.&amp;nbsp;13–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestral veneration in some cultures (such as [[Culture of China|Chinese]]) (敬祖, [[pinyin]]: ''jìngzǔ''), as well as ancestor worship (拜祖, [[pinyin]]: ''bàizǔ''), seeks to honor and reminiscence the actions of the deceased; the ultimate homage to the dead. The importance of paying respect to parents (and elders) lies with the fact that all physical bodily aspects of one's being were created by one's parents, who continued to tend to one's well-being until one is on firm footings. The respect and the homage to parents, is to return this gracious deed to them in life and after, the ultimate homage. The [[Shi (personator)|''shi'']] (尸; "corpse, personator") was a [[Zhou dynasty]] (1045&amp;nbsp;BCE-256&amp;nbsp;BCE) sacrificial representative of a dead relative. During a ''shi'' ceremony, the ancestral spirit supposedly would enter the personator, who would eat and drink sacrificial offerings and convey spiritual messages.

Sacrifices are sometimes made to altars as food for the deceased. This falls under the modes of communication with the [[Chinese spiritual world concepts]]. Some of the veneration includes visiting the deceased at their graves, and making or [[Papier-mache offering shops in Hong Kong|buying offerings]] for the deceased in the [[Chinese New Year|Spring]], [[Double Ninth Festival|Autumn]], and [[Ghost Festival]]s. Due to the hardships of the late 19th- and 20th-century China, when meat and poultry were difficult to come by, sumptuous feasts are still offered in some Asian countries as a practice to the spirits or ancestors. However, in the orthodox [[Taoist]] and Buddhist rituals, only vegetarian food would suffice.

For those with deceased in the afterlife or [[diyu|hell]], elaborate or even creative offerings, such as [[domestic worker|servants]], [[refrigerator]]s, [[house]]s, [[car]], paper money and [[shoe]]s are provided so that the deceased will be able to have these items after they have died. Often, paper versions of these objects are burned for the same purpose. Originally, real-life objects were buried with the dead. In time these goods were replaced by full size clay models which in turn were replaced by scale models, and in time today's paper offerings (including paper servants).

In [[Korea]], ancestor veneration is referred to by the generic term ''[[Jongmyo jerye|jerye]]'' (hangul: 제례; hanja: {{linktext|祭|禮}}) or ''[[jesa]]'' (hangul: 제사; hanja: {{linktext|祭|祀}}). Notable examples of ''jerye'' include ''[[Munmyo]] jerye'' and ''[[Jongmyo]] jerye'', which are performed periodically each year for venerated Confucian scholars and kings of ancient times, respectively. The ceremony held on the [[Death anniversary|anniversary]] of a family member's death is called ''charye'' (차례). It is still practiced today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VDRAah_jogMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ancestor+worship&amp;sig=7awb9V-xHxY2WXWXzxZG2vDmJf4 ''Ancestor Worship and Korean Society,'']  Roger Janelli, Dawnhee Janelli, [[Stanford University Press]], 1992. {{ISBN|0-8047-2158-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestral rites are typically divided into three categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bae|first=Choon Sup|date=August 2007|title=The Challenge of Ancestor Worship in Korea|publisher=University of Pretoria|url=http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05272008-141650/unrestricted/03chapter4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
[[File:Vietnamese Ancestors Altar.jpg|thumb|right|A Vietnamese altar for ancestors. Note smaller Buddhist altar set higher in the upper corner]]
[[File:Cung tat nien.jpg|thumb|An old man in traditional dress on the occasion of New Year offering]]
Ancestor veneration is one of the most unifying aspects of [[Culture of Vietnam|Vietnamese culture]], as practically all Vietnamese, regardless of religious affiliation ([[Buddhist]] or [[Catholic]]) have an ancestor altar in their home or business.

In Vietnam, traditionally people did not celebrate birthdays (before Western influence), but the [[death anniversary]] of one's loved one was always an important occasion. Besides an essential gathering of family members for a banquet in memory of the deceased, incense sticks are burned along with [[Hell bank note|hell notes]], and great platters of food are made as offerings on the ancestor altar, which usually has pictures or plaques with the names of the deceased. In case of missing persons believed dead their family, a [[Wind tomb]] is made, an empty tomb to venerate their dead.

These offerings and practices are done frequently during important traditional or religious celebrations, the starting of a new business, or even when a family member needs guidance or counsel and is a hallmark of the emphasis Vietnamese culture places on filial duty.

A significant distinguishing feature of Vietnamese ancestor veneration is that women have traditionally been allowed to participate and co-officiate ancestral rites, unlike in Chinese Confucian doctrine, which allows only male descendants to perform such rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rambo|first=A.

==South and Southeast Asian cultures==

===Burma (Myanmar)===
Ancestor worship is no longer present in modern-day Burma (except within some ethnic minority communities), but remnants of it still exist, such as worship of [[Bo Bo Gyi]] (literally "great grandfather"), as well as of other guardian spirits such as [[nat (spirit)|nats]], all of which may be vestiges of historic ancestor worship.&lt;ref name="sad"&gt;{{cite book |title=Burma at the turn of the twenty-first century |last=Sadan |first=Mandy |editor=Monique Skidmore |year=2005 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location=Hawaii |isbn=978-0-8248-2897-4 |pages=90–111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestor worship was present in the royal court in pre-colonial Burma. During the [[Konbaung dynasty]], solid [[gold]] images of deceased kings and their consorts were worshiped three times a year by the royal family, during the Burmese New Year (''[[Thingyan]]''), at the beginning and at the end of the [[Vassa|Buddhist lent]].&lt;ref name="harv"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=G. E.|title=History of Burma|publisher=Longmans|year=1925|pages=327–328}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images were stored in the treasury and worshiped at the Zetawunzaung ({{my|ဇေတဝန်ဆောင်}}, "Hall of Ancestors"), along with a book of odes.&lt;ref name="harv"/&gt;

Some scholars attribute the disappearance of ancestor worship to the influence of [[Buddhist]] doctrines of [[anicca]] and [[anatta]], impermanence and rejection of a 'self'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spiro|first=Melford E.|title=Burmese Supernaturalism|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1978|pages=69–70|isbn=978-1-56000-882-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestors are acknowledged and honoured in [[Indian Subcontinent]] among [[Hindus]]. When a person dies, the family observes a thirteen-day mourning period, generally called ''[[śrāddha]]''. A year thence, they observe the ritual of Tarpan, in which the family makes offerings to the deceased. During these rituals, the family prepares the food items that the deceased liked and offers food to the deceased. They offer this food to crows as well on certain days as it is believed that the soul comes in the form of a bird to taste it. They are also obliged to offer ''śrāddha'', a small feast of specific preparations, to eligible [[Bramhins]]. Only after these rituals are the family members allowed to eat. It is believed that this reminds the ancestor's spirits that they are not forgotten and are loved, so it brings them peace. On Shradh days, people pray that the souls of ancestors be appeased, forget any animosity and find peace.

Each year, on the particular date (as per the [[Hindu calendar]]) when the person had died, the family members repeat this ritual.

Apart from this, there is also a fortnight-long duration each year called ''[[Pitru Paksha]]'' ("fortnight of ancestors"), when the family remembers all its ancestors and offers "Tarpan" to them. This period falls just before the [[Navratri]] or [[Durga Puja]] falling in the month of [[Ashwin]]. [[Mahalaya]] marks the end of the fortnight-long Tarpan to the ancestors.&lt;ref name = sharma&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Usha|title=Festivals In Indian Society|publisher=Mittal Publications|year=2008|volume=2|chapter=Mahalaya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6OYRUEAF7oC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=pitru+paksha&amp;q=pitru%20paksha|pages = 72–73 | isbn=978-81-8324-113-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[paliya]]'' memorial stones are associated with ancestral worship in western India.

Me-Dam-Me-Phi &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me-Dam-Me-Phi&lt;/ref&gt; is celebrated by the Ahom people on 31 January every year in memory of the departed. It is the manifestation of the concept of ancestor worship that the Ahoms share with other peoples originating from the Tai-Shan stock. It is a festival to show respect to the departed ancestors and remember their contribution to society.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia ancestor worship has been a tradition of some of the indigenous people. [[Podom]] of the [[Toba Batak people|Toba Batak]], [[Waruga]] of the [[Minahasa]]ns and the coffins of the [[Karo people (Indonesia)]] are a few examples of the forms the veneration takes.

In the [[animistic]] [[Indigenous religious beliefs of the Philippines|indigenous religions]] of the precolonial [[Philippines]], ancestor spirits were one of the two major types of spirits (''[[anito]]'') with whom [[babaylan|shamans]] communicate. Ancestor spirits were known as ''umalagad'' (lit. "guardian" or "caretaker"). They can be the spirits of actual ancestors or generalized guardian spirits of a family. Ancient Filipinos believed that upon death, the soul of a person travels (usually by boat) to a [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]].&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Scott  | first = William Henry  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)   | coauthors =  | title = Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society  | publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press  | date = 1994  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 971-550-135-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="under"/&gt;&lt;ref name="soul"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups-philippines/|title=The Soul According to the Ethnolinguistic Groups of the Philippines|publisher=The Aswang Project|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be multiple locations in the spirit world, varying in different ethnic groups. Which place souls end up in depends on how they died, the age at death, or conduct of the person when they were alive. There was no concept of heaven or hell prior to the introduction of [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]; rather, the spirit world is usually depicted as an [[underworld]] that is a mirror image of the material ("upper") world. Souls reunite with deceased relatives in the underworld and lead normal lives in the underworld as they did in the material world. In some cases, the souls of evil people undergo penance and cleansing before they are granted entrance into a particular spirit realm. Souls would eventually [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]] after a period of time in the spirit world.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="under"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/how-to-travel-the-underworld-of-philippine-mythology/|title=How to Travel the Underworld of Philippine Mythology|publisher=The Aswang Project|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephen K.

Souls in the spirit world still retain a degree of influence in the material world, and vice versa. ''[[Anito|Paganito]]'' rituals may be used to invoke good ancestor spirits for protection, intercession, or advice. Vengeful spirits of the dead can manifest as apparitions or ghosts (''mantiw'') and cause harm to living people.

The predominantly [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]] Filipino people still hold ancestors in particular esteem&amp;mdash;though without the formality common to their neighbours&amp;mdash;despite having been Christianised since coming into contact with Spanish missionaries in 1521. In the present day, ancestor veneration is expressed in having photographs of the dead by the home altar, a common fixture in many Filipino Christian homes. Candles are often kept burning before the photographs, which are sometimes decorated with garlands of fresh [[Jasminum sambac|sampaguita]], the national flower. Ancestors, particularly dead parents, are still regarded as psychopomps, as a dying person is said to be brought to the afterlife ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''sundô'', "fetch") by the spirits of dead relatives. It is said that when the dying call out the names of deceased loved ones, they can see the spirits of those particular people waiting at the foot of the deathbed.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Filipino Catholic and [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente|Aglipayan]] veneration of the dead finds its greatest expression in the Philippines is the Hallowmas season between 31 October and 2 November, variously called ''Undás'' (based on the word for "[the] first", the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] ''andas'' or possibly ''honra''), ''Todos los Santos'' (literally "[[All Saints' Day|All Saints]]"), and sometimes ''Áraw ng mga Patáy'' (lit. "Day of the Dead"), which refers to the following solemnity of [[All Souls' Day]]. Filipinos traditionally observe this day by visiting the family dead, cleaning and repairing their tombs. Common offerings are prayers, flowers, candles, and even food, while many also spend the remainder of the day and ensuing night holding reunions at the graveyard, playing games and music or singing.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[Chinese Filipinos]], meanwhile, have the most apparent and distinct customs related to ancestor veneration, carried over from traditional Chinese religion and most often melded with their current Catholic faith. Many still burn incense and [[joss paper|kim]] at family tombs and before photos at home, while they incorporate Chinese practises into Masses held during the All Souls' Day period.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In Sri Lanka, making offerings to one's ancestors is conducted on the sixth day after death as a part of traditional Sri Lankan funeral rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=MDO_7BncqKwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Studying Buddhism in Practice|first=John S.|last=Harding|date=17 June 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Catholic countries in Europe (continued later with the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Church in England]]), November 1 ([[All Saints' Day]]), became known and is still known as the day to honor those who have died, and who have been deemed official saints by the Church. November 2, ([[All Souls Day]]), or "The Day of the Dead", is the day when all of the faithful dead are remembered. On that day, families go to cemeteries to light candles for their dead relatives, leave them flowers, and often to picnic. The evening before All Saints'—"All Hallows Eve" or "Hallowe'en"—is unofficially the Catholic day to remember the realities of Hell, to mourn the souls lost to evil, and to remember ways to avoid Hell {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}. It is commonly celebrated in the United States and parts of the United Kingdom in a spirit of light-hearted horror and fear, which is marked by the recounting of [[ghost stories]], [[bonfire]]s, wearing [[Halloween costume|costumes]], carving [[jack-o'-lanterns]], and "[[trick-or-treating]]" (going door to door and begging for candy).

Native cultures of the original inhabitants of North America honored the dead with various traditional ceremonies, including food offerings and prayers.

In the United States and Canada, flowers, wreaths, grave decorations and sometimes candles or even small pebbles are put on graves year-round as a way to honor the dead. In the United States, many people honor deceased loved ones who were in the military on [[Memorial Day|Decoration Day also known as Memorial Day]]. Times like Easter, Christmas, [[Candlemas]], and [[All Souls' Day]] are also special days in which the relatives and friends of the deceased gather to honor them with flowers and candles. In the [[Catholic Church]], one's local parish church often offers prayers for the dead on their death anniversary or on special days like [[All Souls' Day]].

Another important holiday in the United States, [[Memorial Day]], is a Federal holiday for remembering the men and women who served in the nation's military that are now deceased; particularly those who died  in war or during active service. In the 147 [[United States National Cemetery System|national cemeteries]], like [[Arlington National Cemetery|Arlington]] and [[Gettysburg National Cemetery|Gettysburg]], it is common for volunteers to place small [[Flag of the United States|American flags]] at each grave. Memorial Day is observed on the last Monday in May, allotting for a 3 day weekend in which many memorial services and parades take place not only across the country, but in 26 [[American Battle Monuments Commission|American cemeteries on foreign soil]]; in the countries of France, Belgium, United Kingdom. Philippines, Panama, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, and Tunisia. It is also common practice among veterans to memorialize fallen service members on the dates of their death. That practice is also common in other countries when remembering Americans who died in battles to liberate their towns in the [[World war|World Wars]]. One example of this is on 16 August (1944) [[Welborn Griffith|Colonel Griffith]], died of wounds from enemy action sustained in [[Lèves]], the same day he is credited with saving [[Chartres Cathedral]] from destruction.

Many [[Mexican people|Mexicans]] celebrate ''[[Dia de los Muertos]]'' (Day of the Dead) on or around All Saints' Day (November 1), this being a mix of a native [[Mesoamerican]] celebration and an imported European holiday. ''[[Ofrenda]]s'' (altars) are set up, with ''[[calavera]]s'' (sugar skulls), photographs of departed loved ones, marigold flowers, candles, and more.

In Judaism, when a grave site is visited, a small pebble is placed on the headstone. While there is no clear answer as to why, this custom of leaving pebbles may date back to biblical days when individuals were buried under piles of stones. Today, they are left as tokens that people have been there to visit and to remember.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orchadash-tucson.org/rabbi-mourning-customs.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721132054/http://www.orchadash-tucson.org/rabbi-mourning-customs.html |date=July 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans of various religions and cultures may build a shrine in their home dedicated to loved ones who have died, with pictures of their ancestors, flowers and mementos. Increasingly, many roadside shrines may be seen for deceased relatives who died in car accidents or were killed on that spot, sometimes financed by the state or province as these markers serve as potent reminders to drive cautiously in hazardous areas. The [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington, D.C., is particularly known for the leaving of offerings to the deceased; items left are collected by the [[National Park Service]] and archived. Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] [[Baptism for the dead#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|perform posthumous baptisms]] and other rituals for their dead ancestors, along with those of other families, with the permission of their descendants.

==Islam==
Islam has a complex and mixed view on the idea of grave shrines and ancestor worship.  The graves of many early Islamic figures are holy sites for Muslims, including [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi|Mohammed]], [[Imam Ali Mosque|Ali]], and a [[Al-Baqi'|cemetery]] with many companions and early caliphs.  Many other mausoleums are major architectural, political, and cultural sites, including the [[Mazar-e-Quaid|National Mausoleum]] in Pakistan and the [[Taj Mahal]] in India. However, the religious movement of [[Wahhabism]] views this veneration of graves as a form of [[shirk (Islam)|idolatry]].  Followers of this movement have destroyed many gravesite shrines, including in [[Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia#Destroyed sites|Saudi Arabia]] and in territory controlled by the [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL#Mosques and shrines|Islamic State]].
