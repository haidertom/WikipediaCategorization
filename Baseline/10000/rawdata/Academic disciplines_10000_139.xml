The '''Array Operations Center''' (AOC) in [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]], [[New Mexico]], is the control and monitor center for the [[Very Long Baseline Array]]. From the AOC, [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] operators are able to remotely control and monitor the ten VLBA telescope stations over the [[internet]]. The operators aim the antennas, select [[radio frequencies]] for observation, control the hard drives, and monitor the weather and 'health' of the equipment at every site. A real-time display of the array's status is available for observers to also monitor their observations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vlba.nrao.edu/whatis/aoc.html NRAO's AOC information page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The VLBA's digital correlator is also housed in the AOC. When the hard drives from the telescopes' last observation are brought to the AOC, the supercalculator combines them into a merged dataset, creating the mathematical equivalent of a single, giant telescope's observation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrao.edu/explorer/vla/TheVLAExplorer.php?map=OperationsSite&amp;id=AOC09&lt;/ref&gt;

The AOC is a component of the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] and is located inside the NRAO's Pete V. Domenici Science Operations Center on the campus of the [[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology]].

'''Australian archaeology''' is a large sub-field in the discipline of [[archaeology]]. Archaeology in Australia takes three main forms, [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] archaeology (the archaeology of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia before and after European settlement), [[historical archaeology]] (the archaeology of Australia after European settlement) and [[maritime archaeology]]. Bridging these sub-disciplines is the important concept of [[cultural heritage management]] which encompasses Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sites, historical sites and maritime sites.

==Research and investigations==
Archaeological studies or investigations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and culture in Australia have had many different agendas through time. Initial archaeological investigation was often focused on finding the oldest sites. By the 1970s, archaeological research was concerned with the environment and the way it impacted on humans. In the late 1970s cultural heritage management gained prominence, with the increasing demands by Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups for representation in archaeological research. At a research level the focus shifted to cultural change of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through time.

Currently, archaeological research places great importance on Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's viewpoints on the land and history of Australia. Consideration is given to Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's belief that archaeological sites are not just capsules of the past but a continuation from the past to the present. Therefore, at a research level significance is placed on the past but also on the importance of the present.

{{See also|Prehistory of Australia}}
The first settlement of Australia is a popular research topic both in archaeology and in the public arena. There is consensus that no [[Hominidae|human or closely related species]] evolved independently in Australia. This is because there have been no species of primate found in Australia, either in the present or in the fossil record. It is therefore assumed that the first settlers of Australia came from outside. At present the fossil record suggests that the first settlers were ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', or fully modern humans.

There is controversy over where the first Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people originated. Both of the two main theories postulate that the first settlers were fully modern humans. Asian genetic studies have demonstrated that there are similarities between Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, [[Melanesians]] and [[India]]ns. However, the suggested date of 60,000 years ago for initial settlement is quite early when compared to other areas of the world. This may suggest that the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population derive from an early African population which migrated along the south coast of Asia, at a much faster rate than other populations migrating across the continents of the [[Holocene]].

The first settlement of Australia most likely occurred during the last glacial maximum. During this time Australia and [[New Guinea]] were joined as a single land mass called [[Sahul continent|Sahul]]. The south-east Asian continent and islands were also joined as a single land mass called [[Sundaland|Sunda]]. It is theorised that the first Australians crossed the sea between Sahul and Sunda about 60,000 to 40,000 years ago. Other dates have been suggested, and this timeframe is not seen as conclusive. Sunda and Sahul had a permanent water-crossing, meaning that the first Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had to make a crossing on the open sea (see [[Wallace Line]]).

Sahul is important in that in the past Australia was not an isolated continent, but was joined with New Guinea (and Tasmania). As such, New Guinea has also been the focus of archaeological investigations by Australian researchers.

The most important early sites in Australia are:
* [[Rottnest Island]] (70,000 years old)
* [[Nauwalabila]] (55,000 – 60,000 years old)
* [[Madjedbebe]] (65,000 years ago)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarkson|first1=Chris|last2=Smith|first2=Mike|last3=Marwick|first3=Ben|last4=Fullagar|first4=Richard|last5=Wallis|first5=Lynley A.|last6=Faulkner|first6=Patrick|last7=Manne|first7=Tiina|last8=Hayes|first8=Elspeth|last9=Roberts|first9=Richard G.|last10=Jacobs|first10=Zenobia|last11=Carah|first11=Xavier|last12=Lowe|first12=Kelsey M.|last13=Matthews|first13=Jacqueline|last14=Florin|first14=S.

* [[Devil's Lair]] (45,000 years old)
* [[Lake Mungo]] (61,000 or 40,000 years old) – controversy exists over precise dating (see below)
The change in sea levels means that the first settlements located on the coast would have been submerged.

With the settlement of Australia, it is most probable that Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people first settled on the northern coast, as this is the area closest to Asia. However, the actual spread of people and the settlement of the continent is debated, with three major models put forward:
* Concentric dispersal through the entire continent through one single "entry" point.
* Coastal dispersal by spreading along the coastline and later entering inland areas, mainly via the major waterways.
* Fluctuating colonisation in and out of different environmental zones. For example, in plentiful years the population would occupy semi-arid regions, but in drought would move to areas with better resources.

===Controversies in Aboriginal archaeology===

====Date of arrival====
There is significant debate over the date of arrival of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into the Australian continent. Until the 1950s it was often believed that arrival of the first Aboriginal people was within the last 10,000 years. In the 1950s, the dates were extended to the last Ice Age, based upon falling sea-levels at that period and the existence of [[landbridge]]s linking the islands of the Sunda Shelf and the Sahul Continental Shelf with Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania. The discovery and use of C14 dating extended the dating to 40,000 years at Lake Mungo, and this was the date most frequently given. However, more recently, the analysis of sea levels has shown that coastlines 40,000 years ago were not as exposed as they were 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. The submergence of the earliest sites of occupation due to rising sea levels has meant that the earliest archaeological signature may in fact represent occupation much later than the initial time of arrival.&lt;ref name="Hiscock, P. 2008"&gt;Hiscock, P. (2008). Archaeology of Ancient Australia, London; New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty in establishing a date of arrival earlier than 50,000 years has been compounded by the widespread use of radiocarbon dating and the supposed "radiocarbon barrier" which establishes 40,000 years as a limit to which C14 dates can be easily and reliably extracted.&lt;ref name="Hiscock, P. 2008"/&gt; This limitation has prompted many archaeologists, including [[Rhys Jones (archaeologist)|Rhys Jones]] and Alan Thorne, to include [[thermoluminescence dating|thermoluminescence dating methods]] in their studies of early occupation sites. It is argued that 60,000 to 70,000 years best fits the evidence from the [[Human genome diversity project]] and a number of other new dating technologies. Some have proposed dates extending back 100,000 to 120,000 years, but these dates are criticised on technical grounds and are not accepted by most scientists. A recent study by Eske Willesev of the University of Copenhagen, of the genome of an Aboriginal man from the [[Western Australia]]n [[Goldfields-Esperance|Goldfields]] confirms that the Aboriginal population separated from the early human stock 70,000 years ago, in Africa or from Oman, and travelled fairly rapidly across south and south eastern Asia to arrive in Australia at least 50,000 years ago, before a second wave travelled into Europe and Asia, receiving some input from the Aboriginal people who had already made that journey.&lt;ref&gt;http://geogenetics.ku.dk/latest-news/aboriginals-get-new-history/ accessed 2/22016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multiple arrivals====
Earlier anthropologists believed that there were "three waves" of arrival of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, the first being the "negrito" Tasmanian people, who were displaced by "Murrayans", who in turn were considered to be displaced by "Carpentarians". These theories were sometimes advocated to disprove the Aboriginal claim to being the indigenous "first peoples". The fact that modern Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people cannot explain the [[Bradshaw rock paintings|Bradshaw figures]] of North Western Australia was also seen as evidence of displacement of earlier peoples by later arrivals. The finding of a robust skeleton with surprisingly so-called "primitive" features at [[Kow Swamp Archaeological Site|Kow Swamp]] was also advocated as proof of an earlier wave of settlers to the continent. Dating of the Kow Swamp material, however, showed that rather than being earlier, it was in fact a lot more recent than the nearby Mungo gracile skeletons that more closely resembled modern Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Today it is thought that Aboriginal people throughout the continent are descendants of an original founder population, although this does not completely exclude some contribution from later arrivals.

For example, on the basis of genomic analysis, it has been found that 4–500 years ago a small band from the Indian sub-continent travelled to northern Australia and contributed to the genome of people living in the north.  At that time the appearance of the backed blade tradition, the dingo and other cultural features have been attributed to the arrivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pugach | first1 = I. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = Genome wide data substanciateHolocene gene flow from India to Australia | url = | journal = Proc.

====Megafauna extinction====
Some researchers, such as [[Tim Flannery]], have put forward the idea that human settlement was responsible for the large climatic and environmental changes that occurred in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, Tim (2002), "The Future Eaters: An Ecological History of the Australasian Lands and People." (Grove Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent and causes of the [[Australian megafauna]]l extinction—generally placed in the [[Late Pleistocene]]—continues as an active debate and is a preoccupation among archaeologists and palaeontologists working in the Australian scene. Besides ongoing attempts to refine the dating and extent of the extinction event(s), much research is actively directed towards establishing whether, or to what extent, [[anthropogenic effects]] played a part in the disappearance of dozens of species of large-bodied animals formerly inhabiting the continent. Central to this question is a determination of how long humans and the megafauna species coexisted. Many factors have been considered as possible causes of the extinction, ranging from environmental variables to entirely human-based activity.

The most extreme theory is that Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were completely responsible for the extinction of these animals through extensive hunting. This theory is largely based on the [[overkill hypothesis]] of the Americas, where hunters travelled through the land exterminating megafauna. The overkill hypothesis is largely discredited (and not just in Australia), as there have been no confirmed discoveries of [[kill sites]], sites that are found in other contexts around the world and associated with megafauna hunting. The sites of [[Cuddie Springs]] in [[New South Wales]], and [[Keilor Archaeological Site|Keilor]] in Victoria, display some evidence of associations between Aboriginal stone tools and megafauna remains, but do not prove conclusively the overkill theory. Furthermore, the coexistence of Aboriginal populations with the megafauna tends to contradict the overkill hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;D.R.Horton, "Red kangaroos: Last of the Australian megafauna" (CSA Illumina)&lt;/ref&gt;  These writers suggest "threshold (for megafauna dieoff) was crossed between 26,000 and 15,000 yr B.P. when the arid area expanded further than usual and water resources in the woodland areas were severely reduced", although this finding is disputed by Roberts ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Roberts R.G. (2001), "New Ages for the Last Australian Megafauna: Continent-Wide Extinction About 46,000 Years Ago" (Science, 8 June 2001: Vol. 292 no. 5523 pp. 1888–1892)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Gifford et al (1999), "Pleistocene Extinction of Genyornis newtoni: Human Impact on Australian Megafauna" (Science 8 January 1999: Vol. 283 no. 5399 pp. 205–208)&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear from [[paleobotany|paleobotanical]] and [[palaeontological]] evidence that the extinction coincided with great environmental change. The high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna, and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire.&lt;ref name = "Biello"&gt;{{cite web

Approximately 18,000 to 7,000 years ago, many societies around the world underwent significant change; in particular, this time marks the rise of agriculture in many Neolithic societies. In the Australian context environmental change did not give rise to the development of agriculture but it may have contributed to the disappearance of populations of animals made even more vulnerable to depletion through hunting and marginalised grazing.

====Lake Mungo dating====
Arguably the oldest human remains in Australia, the Lake Mungo 3 skull was given the age of 60,000 years by Gregory Adcock and his researchers.&lt;ref name="Adcock2001"&gt;{{ cite journal |last=Adcock |first=G. |authorlink= |year=2001 |title=Mitochondrial DNA sequences in ancient Australians: Implications for modern human origins |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume= 98 |issue= 2 |pages=537–542 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.98.2.537|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/98/2/537 |accessdate=|quote= |pmid=11209053 |pmc=14622 |bibcode = 2001PNAS...98..537A |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this claim has been criticised, largely due to the process used to analyse the skull and the claims regarding the dating and the [[mtDNA]] found.&lt;ref name="mungo2"&gt;Brown, Peter. (2005).

Retrieved 9 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Most people suggest that the age of the specimen is approximately 40,000 years. Sensitivities to handling Aboriginal remains means that specimens are not available for further research, so reassessment of the date awaits the development of appropriate ethical protocols.

====The intensification debate====
The idea of intensification was put forward by a number of archaeologists, but the most prominent in developing the idea was [[Harry Lourandos]]. Intensification is an idea that posits that change in economic systems of peoples is controlled by social changes. This means that change can occur without an external force such as environmental change. The idea is derived from a 1990s debate about the [[Tasmania]]n Aboriginal people and whether large social/economic change was caused by environmental factors (see ''[[Environmental determinism]]''), or from factors within the society.&lt;ref name="inten1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lourandos | first1 = Harry | last2 = Ross | first2 = Anne | year = 1994 | title = The Great 'Intensification Debate': Its history and place in Australian Archaeology | journal = Australian Archaeology | volume = 39 | issue = 39| pages = 54–63 |jstor=40287690}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inten2"&gt;Lourandos, Harry. (1997). ''Continent of Hunter-Gatherers''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-35946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant view at the time held that in the case of the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people any social change was largely influenced by external, largely environmental, factors.

The evidence that supports this idea is that sites at approximately the same time (around 4,000 years ago) experienced increased usage. This is supported by increased site numbers, increased artefact density and an expansion into new environments. This evidence has also been explained by environmental factors, large population growth, technological change, or even [[taphonomy|post-depositional factors]].

====The cultivation question====
Kent Flannery's model&lt;ref&gt;Kent Flannery, "Origins and Ecological Effects of Early Domestication in Iran and the Near East," The Domestication and Exploitation of Plants and Animals, eds. Peter J. Ucko and G.W. Dimbleby (Chicago: Aldine Publishing Co., 1969), 73–100&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[broad spectrum revolution]] in which foragers diversified the types of food sources harvested, broadening their subsistence base outward to include more fish, small game, water fowl, invertebrates likes snails and shellfish, as well as previously ignored or marginal plant sources, would seem to apply to Australian hunters and gatherers. These changes were linked to climatic changes, including sea level rises during the [[Flandrian transgression]] in which:

# Conditions became more inviting to marine life offshore in shallow, warm waters.
# Quantity and variety of marine life increased drastically as did the number of edible species.
# Because the rivers' power weakened with rising waters, and the creation of many estuaries, the currents flowing into the ocean were slow enough to allow fish to ascend upstream to spawn.
# Birds found refuge next to riverbeds in marsh grasses and then proceeded to migrate to different habitats.

Aboriginal people had a good understanding of local ecologies, and harvested many varieties of plants and animals in season.  W.E.Roth talks about driving kangaroos into a 3 sided enclosure of nets "with the assistance of numerous beaters".  Wallabies and emus were also caught in a similar way.  Wallaroos were hunted with fire and beaten towards a creek, where they were killed with spears and sticks.&lt;ref name="roth"&gt;Roth W.E. Food: Its Search, Capture and Preparation: North Queensland Ethnography Bulletin No.3 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals were also driven towards set nets and fish traps were common.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Davis G (Nungabana) The Mullunburra: people of the Mulgrave River.  Cassowary Publications. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree to which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the Australian continent practised agriculture has long been debated by archaeologists.  Earlier it was believed that Australian Aboriginal people were ignorant of the principles of agriculture, but this has since been disproven.  For instance, Australian Aboriginal women in traditional societies often transplanted immature "[[bush tucker]]" plants found growing in unfavourable locations to more favourable spots. There were also a number of plants (particularly seeds and roots) that could have lent themselves to cultivation, and were used in making such foods as [[Damper (food)|damper]]. [[Charles Sturt]] in his 1844 expedition to northwest New South Wales and central Australia reports seeing large haystacks built by Aboriginal people of seed crops. This was located east of Depot Glen [[Milparinka]] about 600&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Murray River]]. [[Firestick farming]] has also always been a technique used by Aboriginal people to open the canopy of closed canopy forests, introducing sunlight to the ground, and prompting germination of a number of foodstuffs known to attract [[kangaroo]] and other marsupials. This would encourage a more intensive land use than otherwise. But the main reason for the lack of agriculture in Australia is the extreme variability of the climate. Australia is the only continent on Earth, which, as a result of the [[El Nino]] [[Southern Oscillation]], experiences greater variability between years than it does between the seasons. Such climatic variability makes farming very difficult, especially for incipient farmers who cannot be supported from outside their community. Australian Aboriginal people found that maintaining stable populations below the effective carrying capacity of the environment would enable an adequate supply of food, even in drought years, so maintaining a stable culture. This made [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] a more sustainable activity on the Australian continent than [[neolithic]] farming. Evidence of cultivation at [[Kuk Swamp|Kuk]] in Papua New Guinea, from about 10–12,000 years BP (at a time when that island was joined to Australia, suggests crop raising was possible in the Sahul supercontinent when conditions were favourable.

==Historical archaeology in Australia==
{{main|Historical archaeology in Australia}}
[[Historical archaeology]] is the study of the past through material remains such as artefacts (i.e. objects), structures (e.g. standing and ruined buildings, fences, roads), features (e.g. ditches, mounds, canals, landfill), and even whole landscapes modified by human activity and their spatial and stratigraphic contexts.

The origins of [[historical archaeology in Australia]] are generally held to lie in archaeological investigations by the late William (Bill) Culican at Fossil Beach in Victoria, in Jim Allen's PhD research at Port Essington in the Northern Territory and in Judy Birmingham's work at [[Irrawang Pottery]] in the Hunter Valley of NSW.
An increasingly important area of Australian historical archaeology studies the interaction between European and other settlers, and Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

==Underwater and maritime archaeology in Australia==
[[Underwater archaeology]] is archaeology practised in a submerged environment. It encompasses the pre-historic and historic eras. [[Maritime archaeology]] (the study of humans and their activities in, on, around and under the seas, rivers and estuaries) and Nautical archaeology, (the specialised study of boat and ship construction) are allied sub-disciplines of archaeology as a whole. Often the sites or relics are not inundated, however. Of late these various studies have progressed into the industrial and post-war eras. In mirroring their terrestrial roots, underwater archaeology, maritime and nautical archaeology can now include the examination of a wide range of sites ranging from the indigenous through to [[industrial archaeology]] and of late the study of wartime and post-war sites, including historic submerged aircraft. Better known as a sub-discipline of [[aviation archaeology]], underwater aviation archaeology is arguably the most recent offshoot of underwater archaeology, having developed its theoretical underpinnings and a substantial corpus of fieldwork, research and publication work in the late 1990s. Maritime archaeology, the first of these sub-disciplines to emerge in Australia, commenced under the aegis of Jeremy Green in the 1970s after concerns were expressed by academics and politicians over the rampant destruction of Dutch and British East Indian ships lost on the west coast. After Commonwealth legislation was enacted and enforced after 1976 and the States enacted their own legislation the sub-discipline spread throughout Australia, as a result of on-going funding by both the States and the Commonwealth. While also encompassing the study of port-related structures (e.g. jetties, anchorages), lighthouses, moorings, defences etc., initially the focus in maritime archaeology was solely on shipwrecks.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, M., (ed.) 2007. Shipwreck archaeology in Australia. UWA Press, Nedlands&lt;/ref&gt; Now far broader in its scope, in some states maritime and underwater archaeology is managed by museums and in others by cultural heritage management units. There are also numerous practitioners in private practice, or acting as consultants. Regardless, all practitioners operate under the aegis of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology (AIMA).&lt;ref&gt;Staniforth, M., &amp; Nash, M., (eds.) 2006, Underwater Archaeology: Australian Approaches. Springer,  NY&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural heritage management==
Commercial or consulting archaeology (also termed [[cultural heritage management]]) only developed in earnest in Australia from the 1970s, with the advent of various state legislation requiring approvals for damage or disturbance to archaeological relics, such as the Aboriginal and Archaeological Relics Preservation Act 1972, in Victoria. The [[Victoria Archaeological Survey]] was established from the Relics Office in 1975. Historical Archaeology is generally protected by separate legislation, such as the New South Wales Heritage Act 1977, and the various other state counterparts.

Cultural Heritage Management for archaeological sites is seen in the context of wider heritage issues, and follows the principles set out in the [[Burra Charter]] or the [[Australia ICOMOS]] charter for the conservation of places of cultural significance.

From a handful of practitioners in the '70s, there are now more than 250 commercially based archaeologists in Australia. Again in Victoria, one of the first to establish was du Cros and associates (later absorbed by Biosis Research, renamed [[Biosis Pty Ltd]] in 2012). The [[Australian Association of Consulting Archaeologist]] Inc. (AACAI) is the professional body established in 1979 with presently about 50 full members. In New South Wales, companies such as Casey and Lowe and GML have specialised in large scale historical archaeological salvage.

Consultancy archaeology is primarily driven by development, and so is often at the centre of controversy over ownership of heritage and in particular the conflicting objectives of conservation and development. Aboriginal communities often ascribe a special significance to the places where archaeological remains have been found.

===Legal obligations in Australia===
Protection and management of archaeology in Australia is controlled by Federal and State Government legislation including the Commonwealth Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and the various state archaeological legislation such as Victoria's Heritage Act 1995 (covering historical archaeology) and the [[Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006 (Victoria)|Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006]]. Several states maintain archaeological site inventories as the main management tool. The principle of most forms of archaeological legislation in Australia is to provide blanket protection for all archaeological remains and sites, whether or not they have been recorded, and use a system of permits and consents to control change to those sites. for Aboriginal archaeological sites, there is often a requirement for consultation with traditional owners, and they sometimes have a role in approving works that impact on archaeological sites.

===Native title and land rights===
{{main|Native title in Australia}}
Native title is formalised under The Commonwealth [[Native Title Act 1993]] which establishes a framework for the protection and recognition of [[native title]]. The Australian legal system recognises native title where:
*the rights and interests are possessed under traditional laws and customs that continue to be acknowledged and observed by the relevant Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders
*by virtue of those laws and customs, the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders have a connection with the land or waters
*the native title rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia.

==Professional societies in Australian archaeology==
The [[Australian Archaeological Association]] is one of the largest and oldest organisations devoted to furthering archaeology of all types within Australia.

The [[Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology]] (ASHA) founded as the Australian Society for Historical Archaeology in 1970. Its aims were, and still are, to promote the study of historical archaeology in Australia.

The [[Archaeological and Anthropological Society of Victoria]] (AASV) is predominantly a non-professional organisation, which was formed in 1976 in through the amalgamation of two earlier societies, the [[Anthropological Society of Victoria]] formed in 1934, and the [[Archaeological Society of Victoria]] formed in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120716131750/http://www.aas.asn.au/conf07/sessions/sesabs01c.php Margaret Bullen, ''Transforming Economies, Changing States'' Australian Anthropological Society, Annual Conference 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The principal academic journals publishing on Australian Archaeology in Australia, are: ''[[Australian Archaeology (journal)|Australian Archaeology]]'', ''[[The Artefact (journal)|The Artefact]]'', the ''Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology'', and ''[[Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology#Publications|Australasian Historical Archaeology]]'', while some history focused journals such as ''[[History Australia]]'' also feature Australian Archaeology related topics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.informit.com.au/search;action=doSearch RMIT INFORMIT journal search ''Australia'' AND ''Archaeology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Several international journals such as ''Science'', ''Antiquity'' and the ''International Journal of Historical Archaeology'', often publish articles on Australian Archaeology.

'''Blast fishing''' or '''dynamite fishing''' is the practice of using [[Explosive material|explosives]] to stun or kill schools of fish for easy collection. This often illegal practice can be extremely destructive to the surrounding [[ecosystem]], as the explosion often destroys the underlying habitat (such as [[coral reef]]s) that supports the fish.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"&gt;[http://www.rareplanet.org/sites/rareplanet.org/files/notes_citation_cherry.doc McClellan, K., &amp; Bruno, J. (2008). Coral degradation through destructive fishing practices. ''Encyclopedia of Earth. Eds. Cutler J. Cleveland Washington, DC: Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The frequently improvised nature of the explosives used means danger for the fishermen as well, with accidents and injuries.

== Description ==
[[File:തോട്ട പൊട്ടിക്കൽ 01.jpg|thumb|Fish floating immediately after the blast.]]
Although outlawed, the practice remains widespread in [[Southeast Asia]], as well as in the [[Aegean Sea]], and coastal [[Africa]]. In the Philippines, where the practice has been well-documented,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tracc.00server.com/Fisheries/blast_fishing/economics.html Blast Fishing]&lt;/ref&gt; blast fishing was known prior to [[World War I]], as this activity is mentioned by [[Ernst Jünger]] in his book ''[[Storm of Steel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jünger, Ernst (2004 ed) [https://books.google.com/books?id=j3XNeuiucdoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA104&amp;dq=%22Storm+of+Steel%22+fishing&amp;ei=dayISYTRFo_ekwTq1PCRBg ''Storm of Steel''] Penguin Classics. Page 104. Translated by Michael Hofmann. {{ISBN|978-0-14-243790-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One 1999 report estimated that some 70,000 fishermen (12% of the Philippines' total fishermen) engaged in the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oneocean.org/overseas/may99/a_closer_look_at_blast_fishing_in_the_philippines.html A Closer Look at Blast Fishing in the Philippines]&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive hard-to-patrol coastlines, the lure of lucrative, easy catches, and in some cases outright apathy or corruption on the part of local officials make enforcement of blast fishing bans an ongoing challenge for authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.int/Coastfish/News/lrf/8/LRF8-05-Pet.htm Destructive fishing mini symposium at the 9th International Coral Reef Symposium], Bali, Indonesia&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:തോട്ടയിൽ തിരിവയ്ക്കുന്നു 01.jpg|thumb|left|Explosives being prepared for blast fishing]]
Commercial [[dynamite]] or, more commonly, [[Improvised explosive device|homemade bombs]] constructed using a glass bottle with layers of powdered [[potassium nitrate]] and pebbles or an [[ANFO|ammonium nitrate and kerosene]] mixture are often employed. Such devices, though, may explode prematurely without warning, and have been known to injure or kill the person using them, or innocent bystanders.&lt;ref name="eoearth.org"/&gt;

Underwater shock waves produced by the explosion stun the fish and cause their [[swim bladder]]s to rupture.  This rupturing causes an abrupt loss of [[buoyancy]];  a small number of fish float to the surface, but most sink to the sea floor.  The explosions indiscriminately kill large numbers of fish and other marine organisms in the vicinity and can damage or destroy the physical environment, including extensive damage to coral reefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stigmes.gr/br/brpages/articles/dinambr.htm Explosions In The Cretan Sea: The scourge of illegal fishing].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis JA (1996) [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA315490 "Effects of underwater explosions on life in the sea"] Australian Department of Defence, DSTO-GD-0080.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on coral reefs==
{{main|Coral reef}}

Researchers believe that destructive fishing practices like blast fishing are one of the biggest threats to the coral reef ecosystems. Blown up coral reefs are no more than rubble fields. The long-term impact associated with blast tanks is that there is no natural recovery of the reefs. Coral reefs are less likely to recover from constant disturbance such as blast fishing than from small disturbance that does not change the physical environment. Blast fishing destroys the calcium carbonate coral skeletons and is one of the continual disruptions of coral reefs.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, H. E., Pet, J. S., Dahuri, R., &amp; Caldwell, R. L. (2003). Recovery in rubble fields: long-term impacts of blast fishing. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 46(8), 1024-1031. Retrieved October 25, 2009, from ScienceDirect.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indo-Pacific, the practice of blast fishing is a main cause of coral reef degradation. As a result, weakened rubble fields are formed and fish habitat is reduced.

The damaged coral reefs from blast fishing lead to instant declines in fish species wealth and quantity.&lt;ref&gt;Raymundo, L. J., Maypa, A. P., Gomez, E. D., &amp; Cadiz, P. (2007). Can dynamite-blasted reefs recover? A novel, low-tech approach to stimulating natural recovery in fish and coral populations. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 54(7), 1009-1019. Retrieved October 25, 2009, from ScienceDirect.&lt;/ref&gt; Explosives used in blast fishing not only kill fish but also destroy coral skeletons, creating unbalanced coral rubble. The elimination of the fish also eliminates the resilience of the coral reefs to climate change, further hindering their recovery. Single blasts cause reefs to recover over 5–10 years, while widespread blasting, as often practiced, transforms these biodiverse ecosystems into continuous unstable rubble.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, H. E., &amp; Caldwell, R. L. (2006). Recovery From Blast Fishing On Coral Reefs: A Tale of Two Scales. Ecological Applications, 16(5), 1631-1635. Retrieved October 25, 2009, from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Control ==

=== Community-based enforcement ===
In [[Tanzania]], one of the few methods to help manage blast fishing is a joint approach between fisheries officers and village committees.  Working together, they help the enforcement agencies recognize offenders by patrolling the sea as well as providing information collected in the local villages. As a result, this has assisted the enforcement agencies to reduce the occurrence of fish blasting from an average of 8 per day to zero. It has also provided sustainable funding to continue the efficient patrols, a certified planning institution, and suitable training and information to prosecutors and judges.

Similar patrols employed in Indonesia and Philippines have reduced the amount of blast fishing occurrences there. Based on dialogue with stakeholder groups in [[Southeast Asia]] and people of Tanzania and Philippines, it is evident that firmer enforcement is an effective strategy in managing blast fishing. Many countries have laws regarding blast fishing, but they are not fully implemented. Effective management of [[Marine Protected Area]]s (MPAs) is key in the patrolling of illegal fishing areas.

Besides patrols, the restricting or even banning of the sale of ammonium nitrate also makes it much more difficult to produce the explosives that are needed for blast fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 14, 2005|title=H.R. 3197, Security Handling Of Ammonium Nitrate|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-109hhrg35932/html/CHRG-109hhrg35932.htm|quote= Philippines, Colombia and ireland banning sale of ammonium nitrate to reduce production of explosives|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is not to restrict or ban the sale of ammonium nitrate, but instead log the people buying large quantities thereof.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/11/homeland-securi/ Tracking of buyers of ammonium nitrate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Centrally governed enforcement of blast fishing sometimes has limited success, due to resistance of local populations and mistrust of central governments. Bottom up systems based around clearly defined public benefits and education are more beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kusumawati|first=Ika|last2=Huang|first2=Hsiang-Wen|date=2015-01-01|title=Key factors for successful management of marine protected areas: A comparison of stakeholders׳ perception of two MPAs in Weh island, Sabang, Aceh, Indonesia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X14002620|journal=Marine Policy|volume=51|pages=465–475|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2014.09.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective MPAs have the backing of local leadership and populations due to clearly defined benefits of conservation/ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heber Dunning|first=Kelly|date=2015-12-01|title=Ecosystem services and community based coral reef management institutions in post blast-fishing Indonesia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212041614001491|journal=Ecosystem Services|volume=16|pages=319–332|doi=10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.11.010|hdl=1912/7847}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It has also been shown that effective MPAs have local stakeholders that have accurate perceptions of the environmental health of the region. When coastal residents believe that the ecosystem is healthier than indicators such as species diversity, population, and habitat distribution, they may be less likely to support the MPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garces|first=Len R.|last2=Pido|first2=Michael D.|last3=Tupper|first3=Mark H.|last4=Silvestre|first4=Geronimo T.|date=2013-09-01|title=Evaluating the management effectiveness of three marine protected areas in the Calamianes Islands, Palawan Province, Philippines: Process, selected results and their implications for planning and management|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569112001743|journal=Ocean &amp; Coastal Management|series=Special Issue: Advancing Ecosystem Based Management|volume=81|pages=49–57|doi=10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2012.07.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, effective blast fishing community control rely on education campaigns that bring awareness to the relationship between fish stock and fishing rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foale|first=Simon|last2=Manele|first2=Bruno|date=2004-12-01|title=Social and political barriers to the use of Marine Protected Areas for conservation and fishery management in Melanesia|journal=Asia Pacific Viewpoint|language=en|volume=45|issue=3|pages=373–386|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8373.2004.00247.x|issn=1467-8373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blast monitoring programs and eradication methods ===
This method involves seismic technology developed by the US Government for detecting underwater explosions. Re-adapted for use as background blast monitoring equipment Hong Kong in 1995, first installed in the north eastern waters. Fixed monitoring locations were established in 2006, notably one near to the Jockey Club HSBC WWF Hong Kong Hoi Ha Marine Life Centre. Data from these units were used for discussions with the Marine Police and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD). The emphasis for these discussions was placed on protection of the Marine Parks, the last Marine Park bombing occurred in Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park in October, 1999. With the assistance of community programs from NGO's, education awareness from the AFCD and dillegent patrols by the Marine Police Blast fishing was completely eradicated from Hong Kong waters in 2011.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chan|first1=Adrian|title=A systematic analysis of blast fishing in South-East Asia and possible solutions|journal=Underwater Technology 2017|pages=1–6|date=2017|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7890330/|doi=10.1109/UT.2017.7890330|isbn=978-1-5090-5266-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 background blast monitoring (BBM) with this same equipment was installed at Mabul Island in Sabah, Malaysia. In 2014 the Reef Defenders began an aggressive program to create a network of blast monitoring systems throughout South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reef Defenders|url=https://thereefdefenders.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBM is important to guide community based eradication programs, data collected shows that with the use of community based programs in tandem with BBM, the levels of blast fishing can be reduce by up to 90%.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"/&gt; This has already been observed in multiple areas, more importantly there is a significant reduction in other destructive fishing methods, shown by recovery in fish stocks.

== Countries ==

=== Indonesia ===

Blast fishing in [[Indonesia]] has been around for over fifty years and continues to transform its one-of-a-kind coral reefs into desolate gray moonscapes, as fishermen continue to use explosives or cyanide to kill or stun their prey. Dive operators and [[conservationists]] say Indonesia is not doing enough to protect the waters off the [[Komodo Island]]s. They say enforcement declined following the exit of a U.S.-based conservation group that helped fight destructive fishing practices. Coral Gardens that were among Asia's most spectacular dive sites, were the latest victim of bomb blasting despite being located inside the [[Komodo National Park]], a 500,000-acre reserve and [[World Heritage Site|U.N.

While previously Komodo was relatively protected by a cooperative undertaking with TNC (The Nature Conservancy) since the Indonesian government has assumed responsibility for park protection, there has been an upsurge in bombing. During a recent visit to Crystal Boommie, it was found to be 60% destroyed, with freshly overturned coral tables proving recent bombing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/11/07/blast.fishing.enn/index.html Fishermen blast premier dive sites off Indonesia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421231136/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/20/fishermen-blast-premier-dive-sites-indonesia.html |date=April 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the market in the city of [[Makassar]], an estimated 10 to 40 percent of the fish are caught in this manner. The local fishermen find the technique to be easier and more productive than traditional methods. The goal for the country has been to implement stricter policies and fisheries management programs to limit the killing of the fish as well as the destruction to the marine ecosystem. Forty years ago, blast fishing was practiced with [[dynamite]] which was in plentiful supply after [[World War II]]. Today, fishermen mostly use homemade bombs that are made from bottles filled with an explosive mixture; weights are also added to make the bottle sink faster underwater. After the bomb explodes, the fish killed or stunned by the [[shock wave]] from the explosion are collected.&lt;ref&gt;Pet-Soede, L., &amp; Erdmann, M. V. (1998).

=== Philippines ===
A 1987 study concluded that blast fishing was then very widespread in the Philippines, estimating that 25% of all municipal fish landings (equivalent to 250,000 metric tons per year) were from blast fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James B.

In 2010, mayor Nino Rey Boniel of [[Bien Unido, Bohol|Bien Unido]] town in the province of [[Bohol]], [[Philippines]], built an underwater [[grotto]] along the [[Danajon Islet|Danajon]] reef which deteriorated due to excessive [[dynamite]] and [[cyanide]] use. Through the help of [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|Sea Knights]] and Boholano divers, two 14-foot statues of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mother Mary]] and Santo Nino ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for [[Child Jesus|Holy Child]]) were placed on 8 September and 18 October 2010 respectively, 60 feet below sea level in order to discourage fishermen from using illegal and destructive methods in fishing and hopefully remind everyone that the sea and its inhabitants are gifts from God that deserves to be treasured and taken care of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaknights.com/underwater-grotto-bohol.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424043504/http://www.seaknights.com/underwater-grotto-bohol.html |archivedate=2014-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/11/07/10/praying-underwater-bohol | title=Praying underwater in Bohol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the director of the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources declared an “all-out war” against dynamite fishing and other illegal fishing practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/152341/bfar-declares-war-vs-dynamite-fishing|title=BFAR declares war vs dynamite fishing|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tanzania ===
In northern Tanzania, blast fishing, which is illegal, has resurfaced in recent years as a key danger to its coral reefs.  This has occurred even though major institutions like local communities and the district government have been put in place for enhanced fisheries management.  The damage of blast fishing in the area has contributed to unstable coral reefs, discouragement of tourism investors, and a threat to the habitat of [[coelacanth]]s in the region.  Other impacts of blast fishing in the area include reports that citizens have died or lost limbs due to the blasting. The northern part of the country has many beautiful beaches and uninhabited islands. However, many investors feel and tourists are discouraged due to the fish blasting.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, S. (2009). Dynamite fishing in northern Tanzania – pervasive, problematic and yet preventable. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 58(1), 20-23. Retrieved October 25, 2009, from ScienceDirect.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tanzania, coral reefs are essential for both ecological and socio-economic reasons. They are full of fish, [[lobsters]], [[prawns]], [[crabs]], [[octopuses]], [[mollusks]], and [[sea cucumbers]]. In addition, coral reefs are one of the major tourist attractions in Tanzania. The coastal tourism provides a living for the people as well as foreign currency for the country.  However, there has been an increase in the people living along the coast which has led to a large demand for fisheries. It has led to [[overexploitation]] and [[destructive fishing practices]]. Blast fishing has been practised in Tanzania since the 1960s. It was during the 1980s and 1990s that blast fishing was at its peak in Tanzania. For example, in Mnazi bay, [[Mtwara]], 441 blasts were recorded in two months in 1996, and 100 blasts were witnessed through one six-our period in Mpovi reef.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, G. M. (2004).

== Inefficiency  ==
Despite the effectiveness in killing or stunning the fish another problem with blast fishing is the inefficiency of retrieval. For every 10 fish killed only one or two float to the surface due to damage caused to the internal air bladders of the fish. The rest sink to the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Dynamite Fishing With Jacque Coustaeu&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2520">'''Bolster heath''' or '''cushion moorland''' is a type of vegetation community that features a patchwork of very low growing, tightly packed plants found at the limits of some [[Alpine climate|alpine]] environments. The [[cushion plant]]s form a smooth surfaced 'cushions' from several different plants, hence the common name of '''cushion heath'''.  The cushion growth habit provides protection against the desiccating wind and help keep the cluster warm.

Bolster heath is very slow growing and thus very fragile.  Most propagation is by slow expansion, although two species, ''[[Abrotanella forsteroides]]'' and ''[[Pterygopappus lawrencei]]'' produce enough viable seed to survive fire.  The other species are generally permanently destroyed by fire.

The soil in bolster heath is generally quite poor, often gravel with a thin layer of [[peat]].

[[File:Parygin boris dmitrievitch.jpg|thumb|alt="Photo of Russian scientist Boris Parygin."|'''Boris Parygin'''.]]

'''Boris Dmitrievitch Parygin''' (Russian: Борис Дмитриевич Парыгин) (19 June 1930 – 9 April 2012) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and Russian philosopher, sociologist and one of the founders of [[social psychology]] and member of a wide range of international academies. Parygin was a specialist in a sphere of philosophical and psychological problems of social psychology – its history, methodology, theory and [[praxeology]].

== Biography ==
Parygin was born in [[Leningrad]], [[USSR]], where he survived the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. After school he attended [[Saint Petersburg State University]] where he studied philosophy (1948—1953, diploma with distinction). In 1961 he defended a theses about a problem of the social mood. In 1967 defended a doctoral theses ''Social Psychology as a science (questions of history, methodology and theory)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childpsy.ru/upload/dissertations/%CF%E0%F0%FB%E3%E8%ED_%C1_%C4_8_1967.htm Парыгин_Б_Д_8_1967&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
After graduation he was teaching philosophy at [[Saint Petersburg State Pediatric Medical Academy]] (1957–1962). In 1965, Saint Petersburg State University publishing house had released Parygin’s first monograph "Social Psychology as a Science", which became a bibliographical rarity. In 1967, a revised edition of the monograph (15,000 copies) was translated into Czech, Bulgarian and Spanish. 

From 1968 Parygin was at the head of the Philosophy Department of a [[Herzen University]]. There he created the laboratory of the social and psychologic studies and social psychology faculty which was the first one in the Soviet Union. Many first-rate scientists lectured there and books edited by Boris Parygin were published. 

In 1971, Parygin’s work titled ''The Basics of Socio-Psychological Theory'' was published (20,000 printed copies). In his book, Parygin presented the concept of the main social and psychological problems and first of all—the question of personality and human communication. This book drew a wide response in a scientific sphere of the Soviet Union and abroad. The monograph was republished in Germany (Cologne, 1975, Berlin, 1976) and in Japan (Tokyo, 1977).

At the meeting of [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (1972), however, Parygin was called a leader of international [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]] of [[Marxism]] because of his independent interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unlv.edu/centers/cdclv/archives/Interviews/parygin.html Parygin Interview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206173745/http://www.unlv.edu/centers/cdclv/archives/Interviews/parygin.html |date=6 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he was accused of the intention to substitute Marxist philosophy by the Philosophy of Personality. Due to this, he had got a different job in a Social and Economic Problems Institute, where he organized and led the department of socio-psychologic problems of the labor collectives. The results of his work have found reflection in his books ''The Scientific-Technical Revolution and personality'' (1978),&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/415493?lookfor=author:%22Parygin,%20Boris%20Dmitrievich%22&amp;offset=2&amp;max=2 NLA catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; “Social and psychological climate of the collective” (1981),&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Search/Home?lookfor=author:%22Parygin,%20B.%20D.%20%28Boris%20Dmitrievich%29,%201930-%22&amp;iknowwhatimean=1 National Library of Austria&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social psychology of  territorial self-government'' (1993) and others.
Parygin was the head of the Research Committee of a Social Association, coordinated international researches within a [[Comecon]].

== Publications ==

He was the author of 10 prominent monographs and more than 400 articles, which were translated into many foreign languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese, Bulgarian, Czech, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Lettish and others).

Main publications:
* Socio-Psychological Climate of a Collective. 1981. (in Russian).
* Scientific and Technical Revolution and Personality. Moscow, 1978. – 249. p. (in Russian).
* The Basics of Socio-Psychological Theory. Moscow, 1971. – 352 p. (in Russian).

The '''California School of Professional Psychology''' ('''CSPP''') was founded in 1969&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliant.edu/cspp/about-cspp/mission-vision-history.php|title=CSPP's History – Mission – Vision|publisher=Alliant International University|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the California Psychological Association. It is part of [[Alliant International University]] where each campus's [[clinical psychology|Clinical Psychology]] [[Psy.D.]] and [[Ph.D.]] program is individually accredited by the [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/programs/|title=APA-Accredited Programs|website=www.apa.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school has trained approximately half of the licensed psychologists in California.

The school has degree programs in [[clinical psychology]], [[marriage and family therapy]], [[Licensed professional counselor|clinical counseling]], [[Organizational Psychology]], and [[psychopharmacology]] at campuses in [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]], [[Fresno]], [[Sacramento]], and [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], and abroad in [[Tokyo]], Hong Kong and [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alliant's Locations and Campuses|url=http://www.alliant.edu/locations/|publisher=Alliant International University|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSPP is one of a handful of APA- accredited schools that also offered a clinical doctoral respecialization in professional psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/graduate/respecialization.aspx|title=Respecialization in Professional Psychology|website=www.apa.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The California School of Professional Psychology (CSPP) was founded in 1969 under the auspices of the California Psychological Association. CSPP was the first free-standing school of professional psychology in the nation,&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; and remains the largest non-profit professional psychology school in the nation.

The goal of CSPP is to train doctoral level psychologists in professional practice models and to assure that its students and faculty are as diverse as the State of California. At its founding CSPP, worked out of borrowed or rented space with a volunteer (unpaid) faculty, but had a large number of student applicants who were attracted to the new training model.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The founding president of CSPP was [[Nicholas Cummings|Nick Cummings]], PhD, who was succeeded by John O'Neill and subsequently by Judith Albino, PhD. (Mary Beth Kenkel, PhD and [[Rodney L. Lowman]], PhD also served as interim presidents.) During the 2000s, under Albino's tenure, CSPP was renamed Alliant University and the four separately accredited campuses in Fresno, Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco were combined into a single WASC-accredited institution. The name was subsequently changed to Alliant International University after Alliant merged with (acquired the assets of) U.S. International University, based in San Diego. USIU was known for their faculty of humanistic psychologist that included [[Carl Rogers]], [[Abraham Maslow]], [[Viktor Frankl|Victor Frankl]], and [[Igor Ansoff]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=CSPP's History – Mission – Vision|url=http://www.alliant.edu/cspp/about-cspp/mission-vision-history.php|publisher=Alliant International University|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, CSPP is one of several schools that make up Alliant International University including a school of education, forensic psychology, a school of management and a law school. CSPP remains the largest of the schools.

CSPP became accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] (WASC) in 1977. By the mid-1980s all of its Clinical Psychology programs became accredited by the [[American Psychological Association]] and its Marriage and Family Therapy programs are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education of the [[American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy]] (AAMFT). Each psychology doctorate degree program ([[Ph.D.]] or [[Psy.D.]]) on each campus is accredited individually by the [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/programs/clinical.aspx|title=Accredited Programs in Clinical Psychology|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CLEI''', the '''Centre for the Comparative Analysis of Law and Economics, Economics of Law, Economics of Institutions''' is a research center founded in 2004 by four renowned research universities, [[Cornell University Law School]] (School of Law, John M. Olin Program in Law and Economics), [[Ecole Polytechnique]] (Pole de Recherche en Economie et Gestion), [[University of Turin]] (Dipartimenti di Economia 'S.Cognetti de Martiis', Scienze Economiche e Finanziarie 'G.Prato', Scienze  Giuridiche) and the [[University of Ghent]] (Law School, Centre for Advanced Studies in Law and Economics).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/international/study_abroad/turin.cfm Turin Interuniversity Centre for the Comparative Analysis of Law and Economics, Economics of Law, Economics of Institutions (CLEI)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the centre has been expanded to include the following partner universities.

* [[Marburg University]]
* [[University of Eastern Piedmont]]
* [[University of Economics, Prague]]
* [[Université Paul Cézanne Aix-Marseille III]]
* [[Panthéon-Assas University]]

==Purpose==

Though the [[law and economics]] movement has continental foundations as well as roots in [[United States|American]] [[jurisprudence]], over the past fifteen years the field has grown to be dominated by the [[University of Chicago|Chicago law and economics school]].  Despite the dominance of the Chicago approach, international scholars have made vast contributions to the field, and to the broader themes of [[legal theory]] surrounding [[law and economics]].  The purpose of the [[CLEI|CLEI Center]] and its IEL (Institutions, Economics, Law) Ph.D. program is to foster an alternative approach to the comparative analysis of law and economics.  To further this mission, the CLEI Centre and the [[Collegio Carlo Alberto]] attract highly qualified economists and legal theorists from around the world to introduce students to alternative traditions in the law and economics movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://iel.carloalberto.org/ Information regarding the IEL Programme at the CLEI Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

The CLEI Centre also sponsors scholarship focusing on empirical analysis of law.&lt;ref&gt;http://iel.carloalberto.org/Research-and-Pubblication/Conferences.aspx Conference on Efficiency and the Judiciary: Law and Economics Perspectives&lt;/ref&gt;

==CLEI/IEL Program==

The centerpiece of CLEI is a three-year [[Ph.D.]] program.  The program is administered by the [[University of Turin]], graduate division.  The [[CLEI|CLEI Center]] also offers a one-year Master's program in Institutions, Economics and Law.&lt;ref&gt;http://iel.carloalberto.org/Overview/Master-IEL.aspx Description of Master's Program&lt;/ref&gt;  The coordinator of the program is Prof. Giovanni B. Ramello.

The Center sponsors conferences, visiting lecturers, and various other [[keynote address]]es.

Speakers at CLEI have included [[Guido Calabresi]], [[Duncan Kennedy (legal philosopher)|Duncan Kennedy]] and [[Ugo Mattei]].

==Location==

The CLEI centre is located in the city of [[Moncalieri]], (a suburb of the province of [[Torino]]) within the historic [[Collegio Carlo Alberto]].

Note how the segments widely separated in the primary structure have come in contact in the three-dimensional tertiary structure forming part of the same epitope&lt;ref name=goldsby3/&gt;]]

A '''conformational epitope''' is a sequence of sub-units (usually amino acids) composing an [[antigen]] that come in direct contact with a receptor of the immune system.

An antigen is any substance that the [[immune system]] can recognize as foreign. Antigens are usually proteins that are too large to bind as a whole to any [[Receptor (immunology)|receptor]] so only specific segments, that form the antigen, bind with a specific receptor. Such segments are called [[epitope]]s. Likewise, it is only [[paratope]] of the receptor that comes in contact with the epitope.

[[Protein]]s are composed of repeating [[nitrogen]]-containing subunits called [[amino acid]]s that in nature do not exist as straight chains called [[primary structure]], but as folded whorls with complex loops. The latter is known as the [[tertiary structure]] of a protein. So, whenever a receptor interacts with an undigested antigen, the surface amino acids that come in contact may not be continuous with each other if the protein is unwound. Such discontinuous amino acids that come together in three-dimensional conformation and interact with the receptor's paratope are called conformational epitopes. In contrast, if the antigen is digested, small segments called [[peptide]]s are formed, which bind with [[major histocompatibility complex]] molecules, and then later with [[T cell receptor]]s through amino acids that are continuous in a line. These are known as [[linear epitope]]s.&lt;ref name=goldsby3&gt;{{cite book

A '''cycloconverter''' (CCV) or a '''cycloinverter''' converts a constant voltage, constant frequency [[Alternating current|AC]] [[waveform]] to another AC waveform of a lower [[frequency]] by synthesizing the output waveform from segments of the AC supply without an intermediate DC link ({{harvnb|Dorf|1993|pp=2241–2243}} and {{harvnb|Lander|1993|p=181}}). There are two main types of CCVs, circulating current type or blocking mode type, most commercial high power products being of the blocking mode type.&lt;ref name="Klug (2005)"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Klug|first=Dieter-Rolf|author2=Klaassen, Norbert|title=High Power Medium Voltage Drives - Innovations, Portfolio, Trends|year=2005 |booktitle=European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications|doi=10.1109/EPE.2005.219669 |page=5}}&lt;!--|accessdate= Apr 29, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Whereas phase-controlled [[silicon-controlled rectifier|SCR]] switching devices can be used throughout the range of CCVs, low cost, low-power [[TRIAC]]-based CCVs are inherently reserved for resistive load applications. The amplitude and frequency of converters' output voltage are both variable.  The output to input frequency ratio of a three-phase CCV must be less than about one-third for circulating current mode CCVs or one-half for blocking mode CCVs.{{harv|Lander|1993|p=188}}&lt;ref name="Bose 2006, p. 153"&gt;Bose (2006), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Output waveform quality improves as the ''pulse number'' of switching-device bridges in phase-shifted configuration increases in CCV's input.  In general, CCVs can be with 1-phase/1-phase, 3-phase/1-phase and 3-phase/3-phase input/output configurations, most applications however being 3-phase/3-phase.&lt;ref name="Bose (2006)"/&gt;

==Applications==
The competitive power rating span of standardized CCVs ranges from few megawatts up to many tens of megawatts.  CCVs are used for driving [[mine hoist]]s, rolling mill main motors,&lt;ref name="Watzmann (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watzmann|first=Marcus Watzmann|author2=Raskowetz, Steffen|title=Chinese rolling mill for extra high grade aluminium strip|date=Sep–Oct 1996|url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot271.nsf/veritydisplay/c2be0f4cc18285dac1256ddd00346eed/$file/28-33m214.pdf|accessdate=Aug 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ball mill]]s for ore processing, [[cement kiln]]s, [[ship propulsion]] systems,&lt;ref name="Pakaste (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pakaste|first=Risto|title=Experience with Azipod propulsion systems on board marine vessels|date=Feb 1999|url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot271.nsf/veritydisplay/2314773146eb2d77c1256ec300341511/$file/12-18%20ENG%209902.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; slip power recovery wound-rotor induction motors (i.e., Scherbius drives) and aircraft 400&amp;nbsp;Hz power generation.&lt;ref&gt;Bose (2006), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The variable-frequency output of a cycloconverter can be reduced essentially to zero. This means that very large motors can be started on full load at very slow revolutions, and brought gradually up to full speed. This is invaluable with, for example, [[ball mill]]s, allowing starting with a full load rather than the alternative of having to start the mill with an empty barrel then progressively load it to full capacity. A fully loaded "hard start" for such equipment would essentially be applying full power to a stalled motor. Variable speed and reversing are essential to processes such as hot-rolling steel mills. Previously, SCR-controlled DC motors were used, needing regular brush/commutator servicing and delivering lower efficiency. Cycloconverter-driven synchronous motors need less maintenance and give greater reliability and efficiency. Single-phase bridge CCVs have also been used extensively in [[Railway electrification system|electric traction]] applications to for example produce 25&amp;nbsp;Hz power in the U.S. and 16 2/3&amp;nbsp;Hz power in Europe.&lt;ref name="Heydt (2005)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heydt|first=G.T.|author2=Chu, R.F.|title=The power quality impact of cycloconverter control strategies|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery|date=Apr 2005|volume=20|issue=2|pages=1711–1718|doi=10.1109/tpwrd.2004.834350}}&lt;!--|accessdate=Apr 29, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACS 6000c (1998)"&gt;{{cite web|last=ACS 6000c|title=Cycloconverter application for high performance speed and torque control of 1 to 27 MW synchronous motors|url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot216.nsf/veritydisplay/2abc426982e203e6c1256e4d004deb49/$file/acs%206000c%20cycloconverter.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719013216/http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot216.nsf/veritydisplay/2abc426982e203e6c1256e4d004deb49/%24file/acs%206000c%20cycloconverter.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas phase-controlled converters including CCVs are gradually being replaced by faster [[pulse width modulation|PWM]] self-controlled converters based on IGBT, GTO, IGCT and other switching devices, these older classical converters are still used at the higher end of the power rating range of these applications.&lt;ref name="Bose 2006, p. 153"/&gt;

==Harmonics==
CCV operation creates current and voltage ''[[harmonics]]'' on the CCV's input and output. AC line harmonics are created on CCV's input accordance to the equation,
* {{math|&lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} &lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; (&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;&lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt;±1) ± 6&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}},&lt;ref name="IEEE 519"&gt;{{cite journal|last=IEEE Std 519|title=IEEE Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electrical Power Systems|year=1992|publisher=IEEE|page=25|doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.1993.114370}}&lt;!--|accessdate=Apr 12, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4217">'''ELMER''' (Easier and more Efficient Reporting), is a comprehensive set of principles and specifications for the design of Internet-based forms. 

The Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry has decided that the most recent version, ELMER2, shall be the common guidelines for user interfaces in Norwegian public forms for enterprises on the Internet. All public forms in Norway shall be based on the ELMER guidelines within the end of 2008 [http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/nhd/Whats-new/News/2007/Forenkling-for-naringslivet.html?id=443349].
 
The Norwegian authorities emphasize that simplification of public forms is important to improve communication between the users and the public sector. The idea is expressed like this in the preface of the guidelines: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The proceeding transition to electronic reporting may be an important simplification measure for the respondents, but only if the Internet-based solutions are felt to be more ''user friendly'' than the old paper versions. By applying good pedagogical principles, electronic forms may also ensure a better ''understanding'' of the task, better ''validation'' of the data before submission, and by that even better ''response quality'' and more ''efficient processing'' by the relevant authority."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The objective of the ELMER guidelines is to meet the challenges of Internet design and pedagogics that are particular to [[Form (web)|web forms]]. [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines|WCAG]] requirements and [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] conventions have not been baked into the ELMER guidelines, but they shall not contain recommendations which are incompatible with these. In other words, ELMER is not the only set of guidelines to consider, when designing electronic forms, but the only one that concentrate on the ''form'' itself. 

==Background==
===The  first ELMER Project===
During the summer of 2000, an interdisciplinary reference group on electronic reporting initiated the ELMER project. The project followed six enterprises over the period of one year in order to map out their reporting duties, and test simple solutions for electronic reporting based on familiar technology. 

Among other things, the ELMER project presented an example for design of a complex web form. First and foremost the example demonstrated that the use of simple Internet technology opens up for new pedagogical opportunities which may make reporting to governmental authorities a lot easier.

===The ELMER 2 Project===
In 2005 the ELMER 2 project developed the example towards a comprehensive set of principles and specifications for the design of Internet-based forms. Business organizations, governmental bodies, usability experts and form developers were invited to submit suggestions and to take part in debates during the process. Open workshops were held, and a number of authorities and experts wrote, read and commented contributions posted on the project discussion forum.

ELMER 2 has evolved through co-operation between enterprises and experts. The participants have experiences from designing forms for several agencies and suppliers, from the reception and use of the same forms by the inquirer, and from usability testing of ELMER1-based and other electronic forms in varied user groups.

==The guidelines==
The Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry submitted the draft for public hearing in the autumn of 2005. The approved [http://www.elmer.no/retningslinjer/pdf/elmer2-english.pdf ELMER 2 guidelines] was published in October 2006. 
The guidelines are being administered by the [http://www.brreg.no/english/ Brønnøysund Register Centre].

==Disciplines==

===DNA analysis===
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is one of the most popular pieces of evidence to recover at a crime scene.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More often than not, evidence containing DNA is regarded to as ''biological evidence''. With all of the substantial advances that have been made regarding DNA, biological evidence is recognized to be the golden standard in forensic science.

At the scene, biological evidence must be initially visibly recognized. Sometimes this is not always possible and the aid of an alternative light source, or ALS, is required. Once identified as a potential source, presumptive tests are conducted to establish the possibility of the specified biological presence (semen, saliva, blood, urine, etc.).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If positive, samples are collected and submitted for analysis in the laboratory, where confirmatory tests and further tests are performed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[DNA Analysis|DNA analysis]] has numerous applications such as paternity testing, identifications of unknown human remains, cold case breakthroughs, as well as connecting suspects and/or victims to a piece(s) of evidence, a scene, or to another person (victim or suspect, respectively).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nuclear DNA evidence can be recovered from [[blood]], [[semen]], [[saliva]], [[epithelial cells]] and [[hair]] (if the root is still intact).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, [[Mitochondrial DNA]] can be recovered from the shaft of hair, [[bone]] and the roots of [[teeth]]. For most forensic DNA samples, [[STR analysis]] of autosomal short tandem repeats is performed in an attempt to individualize the sample to one person with a high degree of statistical confidence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Using DNA to Solve Cold Cases|last=National Institute of Justice|first=Office of Justice Programs|publisher=|year=July 2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TaqMan Probes.jpg|thumb|TaqMan Probes]][[File:STR electropherogram of a three person mixture.jpg|thumb|STR electropherogram of a three person mixture]]
Laboratory analysis of DNA evidence involves the sample DNA being [[DNA extraction|extracted]], quantitated, amplified, and visualized. There are several methods of DNA extraction possible including [[Phenol-chloroform extraction|organic (phenol-chloroform) extraction]], [[Chelex 100|Chelex]] extraction, and [[differential extraction]]. Quantitation is commonly conducted using a form of the [[polymerase chain reaction]], known as [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|real-time PCR]], quantitative PCR, or qPCR.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Higuchi |first1=R. |last2=Fockler |first2=C. |last3=Dollinger |first3=G. |last4=Watson |first4=R. |title=Kinetic PCR analysis: real-time monitoring of DNA amplification reactions |journal=Bio/Technology |date=1993 |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=1026–1030 |doi=10.1038/nbt0993-1026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Higuchi |first1=R. |last2=Dollinger |first2=G. |last3=Walsh |first3=P.S. |last4=Griffith |first4=R. |title=Simultaneous amplification and detection of specific DNA sequences |journal=Bio/Technology |date=1992 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=413–417 |doi=10.1038/nbt0492-413}}&lt;/ref&gt; qPCR is the preferred method of DNA quantitation for forensic cases because it is very precise, human-specific, qualitative, and quantitative.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Forensic DNA Typing: Biology, Technology, and Genetics of STR Markers |date=2005 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Burlington, MA, USA |isbn=0-12-147952-8 |pages=75–79 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique analyses changes in fluorescence signals of amplified DNA fragments between each PCR cycle without needing to pause the reaction or open the temperature-sensitive PCR tubes.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"/&gt; In addition to the components necessary for standard a PCR reaction (i.e. template DNA, carefully designed forward and reverse [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]], [[DNA polymerase]] [usually ''[[Taq polymerase|Taq]]''], [[Nucleoside triphosphate|dNTPs]], and a buffer solution containing Mg2+), qPCR reactions involve fluorescent dye-labelled [[Hybridization probe|probes]] that complement and anneal to the DNA sequence of interest that lies between the two primers.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"/&gt; A “reporter” (R) dye is attached at the 5’ end of the fluorescent probe while a “quencher” (Q) dye is attached at the 3’ end. Before the DNA strands are extended by the polymerase, the reporter and quencher are close enough in space that no fluorescence is detected by the [[Quantitative PCR instrument|instrument]] (the quencher completely absorbs/masks the fluorescence of the reporter). As the polymerase begins to extend the strand, the 5' end of the probe is degraded by the polymerase due to its [[exonuclease]] activity. The reporter dye is released from the 5’ end and is no longer quenched, thus enabling detection of fluorescence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; A graph is constructed for the sample DNA comparing the presence of fluorescence (y-axis) to cycle number (x-axis) of the qPCR process. This is then compared to a standard curve of the cycle fluorescence threshold (y-axis) versus the log of known DNA concentrations (x-axis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Forensic DNA Typing: Biology, Technology, and Genetics of STR Markers |date=2005 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Burlington, MA, USA |isbn=0-12-147952-8 |page=78 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing the sample data to the standard curve, one may extrapolate the DNA concentration in the sample, which is essential to move forward with PCR amplification and [[capillary electrophoresis]] to obtain a [[genetic fingerprinting|DNA profile]]. DNA profiles are produced in the form of an [[electropherogram]]. The obtained profile can be compared to known samples such as those in [[CODIS]] in order to identify a possible suspect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Based on known frequencies of the [[genotype]] found in the DNA profile, the DNA analyst may place a statistical measure of confidence on DNA match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Advanced Topics in Forensic DNA Typing: Interpretation |date=2015 |publisher=Academic Press |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-0-12-405213-0 |pages=213–444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mitochondrial DNA analysis ====
[[Mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) is used instead of nuclear DNA when forensic samples have been degraded, are damaged, or are in very small quantities. In many cases there may be human remains that are older, sometimes ancient, and the only options for DNA collection are the bone, teeth, or hair of the body.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic DNA Typing: Biology, Technology, and Genetics of STR Markers, Second Edition|last=Butler|first=John|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|year=2005|isbn=0121479528|location=London, UK|pages=241–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; mtDNA is able to be extracted from such degraded samples because its presence in cells is much higher than nuclear DNA. There can be more than 1,000 copies of mtDNA in a cell, while there are only two copies of nuclear DNA.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Nuclear DNA is inherited from both the mother and the father but mtDNA is passed down from only the mother to all of her offspring.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Due to this type of inheritance, mtDNA is useful for identification purposes in forensic work but can also be used for mass disasters, missing persons cases, complex kinship, and genetic genealogy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As mentioned, the main advantage of using mtDNA is its high copy number. However, there are a few disadvantages of using mtDNA as opposed to nuclear DNA. Since mtDNA is inherited maternally and passed to each offspring, all members of the maternal familial line will share a [[haplotype]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jobling|first=Mark A.|last2=Gill|first2=Peter|date=October 2004|title=Correction: Encoded evidence: DNA in forensic analysis|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1455.pdf|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=En|volume=5|issue=10|pages=739–751|doi=10.1038/nrg1455|issn=1471-0056}}&lt;/ref&gt; A haplotype "is a group of alleles in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Haplotype|date=2018-04-19|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Haplotype&amp;oldid=837214748|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sharing of this haplotype among family members can cause an issue in forensic samples because these samples are often mixtures that contain more than one DNA contributor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Deconvolution and interpretation of mtDNA mixtures is more difficult than that of nuclear DNA and some laboratories choose not to attempt the process&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/36c9/9e996c645ede5c596c692356c6aef1660ff8.pdf?_ga=2.268566321.1937055804.1541653920-1523377491.1541653920|title=Forensic Mitochondrial DNA Analysis: Current Practice and Future Potential|last=Melton|first=T.|date=July 2012|website=Semantic Scholar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since mtDNA does not recombine, the genetic markers are not as diverse as autosomal STRs are in the case of nuclear DNA.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another issue is that of [[heteroplasmy]]. Heteroplasmy is when an individual has more than one type of mtDNA in their cells.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This can cause an issue in the interpretation of data from questioned forensic samples and known samples that contain mtDNA.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melton|first=Terry|date=2004|title=Mitochondrial DNA Heteroplasmy|url=http://mitotyping.com/PDF/MtDNA_Heteroplasmy_Melton_FSR.pdf|journal=Forensic Science Review|volume=16|pages=1–20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having adequate knowledge and understanding of heteroplasmy can help ensure successful interpretation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

There are some ways to improve success of mtDNA analysis. Preventing contamination at all testing stages and using positive and negative controls is a priority.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In addition, the use of mini-amplicons can be beneficial. When a sample of mtDNA is severely degraded or has been obtained from an ancient source, the use of small [[amplicon]]s can be used to improve the success of amplification during [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In these cases primers amplifying smaller regions of HV1 and HV2 in the control region of mtDNA are used. This process has been referred to as the 'ancient DNA' approach.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The first use of mtDNA as evidence in court was in 1996 in ''State of Tennessee v. Paul Ware''.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/profiles-in-dna/103/mitochondrial-dna-state-of-tennessee-v-paul-ware.pdf?la=en|title=Mitochondrial DNA: State of Tennessee v. Paul Ware|last=Davis|first=C. Leland|date=1998|website=Promega|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was only circumstantial evidence against Ware so the admittance of mtDNA from hairs found in the victim’s throat and at the scene were key to the case.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 2004, with the help of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and ChoicePoint, mtDNA was used to solve a 22-year-old cold case where the nuclear DNA evidence was not originally strong enough.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/public-safety/DNA-Profiling-Helps-Solve-22-year-old-Murder.html|title=DNA Profiling Helps Solve 22-year-old Murder Case|website=www.govtech.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After mtDNA analysis, Arbie Dean Williams was convicted of the murder of 15-year-old Linda Strait, which had occurred in 1982.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In 2012, mtDNA evidence allowed investigators to establish a link in a 36-year-old investigation into the murder of four Michigan children.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2012/07/17/justice/michigan-dna-cold-case/index.html|title=New DNA work may offer break in 36-year-old Michigan slayings - CNN|last=CNN|first=By Chris Boyette,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hair fibers found on the bodies of two of the children were tested and the mtDNA found to be the same for each sample. For the investigators this was a big break because it meant that the murders were likely connected.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===[[Forensic anthropology]]===
[[Anthropology]] is applied to forensics most regularly through the collection and analysis of human skeletal remains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The primary goals of anthropological involvement include identification and aiding in scene reconstruction by determining details regarding the circumstances of the victim's death. In cases where conventional techniques are unable to determine the identity of the remains due to the lack of soft tissue, anthropologists are required to deduce certain characteristics based on the skeletal remains. Race, sex, age and possible ailments can often be determined through bone measurements and looking for clues throughout the skeletal structure.

===Forensic odontology===
Odontologists or [[dentistry|dentists]] can be used in order to aid in an identification of degraded remains. Remains that have been buried for a long period or which have undergone fire damage often contain few clues to the identity of the individual. [[Tooth enamel]], as the hardest substance in the human body, often endures and as such odontologists can in some circumstances compare recovered remains to dental records.

===Forensic pathology===
A [[Forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] is a medical doctor who is an expert in both trauma and disease and is responsible for performing autopsies. He/she applies their extensive knowledge of the human body and possible internal and external inflictions as he/she performs an autopsy, to hopefully ascertain the manner and cause of death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Information derived from the autopsy often greatly assists investigative efforts as well as scene reconstruction.

===Forensic toxicology===
[[Forensic toxicology]] is the use of [[toxicology]] and other disciplines such as [[analytical chemistry]], [[pharmacology]] and [[clinical chemistry]] to aid medical or legal investigation of death, poisoning, and drug use. The primary concern for forensic toxicology is not the legal outcome of the toxicological investigation or the technology utilized, but rather the obtainment and interpretation of results.

== Forensic microbiology ==
With recent advances in [[massive parallel sequencing]] (MPS), or [[next-generation sequencing]] (NGS), forensic microbiology has become an increasingly promising area of research. “Initial applications in circumstances of biocrime, bioterrorism and epidemiology are now accompanied by the prospect of using microorganisms (i) as ancillary evidence in criminal cases; (ii) to clarify causes of death (e.g., drownings, toxicology, hospital-acquired infections, sudden infant death and shaken baby syndromes); (iii) to assist human identification (skin, hair and body fluid microbiomes); (iv) for geolocation (soil microbiome); and (v) to estimate postmortem interval (thanatomicrobiome and epinecrotic microbial community)”.&lt;ref&gt;Oliveira, M. &amp; Amorim, A. Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2018). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-9414-6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioterrorism and epidemiology ===
“It is important to remember that biological agents that can be used as weapons are often found in the environment. For this reason, it is always difficult to determine whether infections associated with these bioagents are accidental or purposely started”.&lt;ref&gt;González, Alfredo A., Jessica I. Rivera-Pérez, Gary A. Toranzos. Forensic Approaches to Detect Possible Agents of Bioterror. Microbiology Spectrum April 2017 vol. 5 no. 2.
doi:10.1128/microbiolspec.EMF-0010-2016
&lt;/ref&gt; While not the first, or only, incidence of bioterrorism, perhaps the most notable case in recent memory involved the sending of at least four anthrax-containing envelopes in the United States in September and October 2001. “At least 22 victims contracted anthrax as a result of the mailings: 11 individuals contracted inhalation anthrax, with 5 of these infections resulting in fatalities; another 11 individuals suffered cutaneous anthrax. In addition, 31 persons tested positive for exposure to B. anthracis spores”.&lt;ref&gt;Rasko, David A.,a Patricia L. Worsham,b Terry G. Abshire,b Scott T. Stanley,c,1 Jason D. Bannan,d Mark R.

&lt;/ref&gt; However, thanks to advancements in PCR and whole-genome sequencing, scientists were able to collaborate with the FBI and were able to identify the source of the letter spores.

=== Postmortem analysis ===
“Post-mortem microbiology (PMM) aims to detect unexpected infections causing sudden deaths; confirm clinically suspected but unproven infection; evaluate the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy; identify emergent pathogens; and recognize medical errors. Additionally, the analysis of the thanatomicrobiome may help to estimate the post-mortem interval.”.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Rodríguez, A.,1 J.L.Burton2 L.Andreoletti3 J.Alberola4 P.Fornes5 I.Merino67 M.J.Martínez89 P.Castillo810 B.Sampaio-Maia11 I.M.Caldas12 V.Saegeman13 M.C.Cohen14 ESGFOR and the ESP.

&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently an extensive amount of research being performed, most notably using the famous “body farms” throughout the United States, to determine if there is a consistent microbial decomposition “clock” that could be used by itself, or in conjunction with other techniques (such as forensic entomology) to help estimate postmortem intervals. One such group has made extensive headway into describing such a microbial clock, and “believes she’s within two to five years of testing her clock in a real crime scene scenario”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Beans, Carolyn. News Feature: Can microbes keep time for forensic investigators? Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 Jan 2; 115(1): 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if a reliable and consistent microbial clock is determined to exist, “it’s too soon to know whether the microbial clock will pass scientific and legal muster,” (Beans) and “a judge would also have to determine that the microbial clock meets the standard for admission of expert testimony”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

== Current issues ==

=== Sexual assault kit backlog ===
Prior to DNA testing, many sexual assault cases could only rely on "his said, she said" and possible witnesses. Even once DNA analysis was available, many sexual assault kits, or SAKs, were never tested and thrown into a backroom or storage facility, only to be forgotten about until discovered. Now that DNA analysis is frequently utilized in the majority of cases, most SAKs are examined and analyzed. However, the issue remains about the preexisting SAKs that have never been tested. A prevalent issue then, that still extends to now, is the absence of funds to actually process and analyze these SAKs. Many districts would dedicate their funds to homicides or more high profile cases and sexual assaults would be swept to the side. The biggest concern about all of these SAKs, is how to go about processing all of them, especially as more and more are being found each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo67935/249234.pdf|title=Creating a Plan to Test a Large Number of Sexual Assault Kits|last=National Institute of Justice|first=|date=March 2016|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cold cases ===
With the considerable amount of advances in DNA analysis, old, open cases that still have intact evidence can be examined for biological evidence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; New profiles are uploaded to [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]] everyday so the base population to search and compare to increases. Biological testing for cold cases, specifically homicides, encounter similar roadblocks as the SAKs - lack of funds or the DNA samples have not been properly stored thus too much degradation has occurred for viable analyses.

==Popular culture==

In popular culture, forensic biology is frequently portrayed in shows like ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI]]'', ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' and ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]''. However thanks to Hollywood's depiction of forensic science, the analysis of biological evidence has fallen prey to the [[CSI effect|CSI Effect]], which results in the public's perception of its capabilities being severely distorted and its limits blurred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8145">'''Fritz Neugass''' (March 28, 1899, [[Mannheim]]–June 1979, [[New York City]]) was a German art critic and photographer.

==Early life==
Fritz Neugass was of Jewish origin. His father Julius Neugass (1869-1939) was an [[Otorhinolaryngology|ear, nose and throat specialist]] in [[Mannheim]]. Neugass took part in [[World War I]] in 1917, but was released in 1918 after being seriously injured. Influenced by the [[Wandervogel]] youth movement, he temporarily turned to [[Protestantism]]. 

==Art historian==
From 1919 he studied art history and archeology in [[Munich]], [[Berlin]] and [[Bonn]] and completed his doctorate in 1924, writing a thesis on [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Choir (architecture)|choir stalls]], supervised by art historian [[Carl Neumann Degler|Carl Neumann]] (1860-1934) in [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000584035 Neugass, F. (1927). Mittelalterliches chorgestühl in Deutschland. Strassburg: J. H. E. Heitz.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 he was a volunteer at the [[German Archaeological Institute|Deutschen Archäologischen Institut]] (German Archaeological Institute) in [[Rome]] and then in [[Florence]] and participated in excavations on [[Sicily]]. 

==Photographer and journalist==
In 1926 he settled in Paris and became a photographer and correspondent for numerous German and international newspapers. He reported for the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'', the ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'', [[Cicerone (publisher)|Cicerone]], ''[[KUNST Magazin|Kunst]]'', and especially Weltkunst. He became known for his reviews for world art and reports on the current [[Paris]] art scene. In addition to exhibition reports and essayistic works he wrote knowledgeable monographs on artists including [[Giorgio de Chirico|de Chirico]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], and [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]. In autumn 1933 he was romantically involved with {{ill|Luise Straus-Ernst|de}}, first wife of [[Max Ernst]] (m. 1918–1927), who had fled to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Weissweiler, Eva | title=Notre Dame de Dada : Luise Straus-Ernst, das dramatische Leben der ersten Frau von Max Ernst | publication-date=2016 | publisher=Köln Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsch | edition=1. Auflage | isbn=978-3-462-04894-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1933-39, he set out as a photographer and correspondent traveling widely and reported for English, American, French and Swiss newspapers mainly on travel and politics in Mediterranean countries.

Shortly after the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] Neugass was interned in the camp [[Fort Carré]] in [[Antibes]]. In November 1939 he was transferred to [[Les Milles]] near [[Aix-en-Provence]]. There he met amongst others Max Ernst, [[Walter Hasenclever]] and [[Lion Feuchtwanger]]. In 1939, under the pseudonym "François Neuville" he wrote the novel ''Das Geheimnis um die Venus'' (‘The Mystery about Venus’), originally planned as a movie starring the actor [[Raimu]], which appeared in two separate Swiss newspapers. In the spring of that year he joined the French army.

As a journalist, he was accused by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] in 1941 of distributing enemy propaganda and sentenced. In order to forestall the impending expulsion to Germany, he emigrated in late 1941 via [[Casablanca]] and [[Cuba]] to the [[United States]]. 

==Life in the United States==
From 1942 to 1947 Neugass worked in various bookstores and for the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]]. In 1944 he married librarian Lotte Labus, who had earned her own Ph.D in Berlin, and was granted American citizenship in 1947 and freelanced for several magazines, including articles illustrated with his own photographs ’Window Shopping With Your Camera’ for ''[[Popular Photography]].''&lt;ref&gt;Popular Photography, Dec 1949, Vol. 25, No. 6. pps 40-43&lt;/ref&gt; and 'Portraiture with Match and Candle' for ''The American Annual of Photography''&lt;ref&gt;The American Annual of Photography, Volume 67, p.52ff Tennant and Ward, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s he wrote for various European newspapers [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'']], ''[[Handelsblatt]]'', ''[[Aufbau]]'', and [[ARTnews|''Art News'']] and was the American correspondent to the Swiss [[Camera (magazine)|''Camera'']] magazine&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=49hTAAAAMAAJ Tom Maloney U.S. Camera Annual 1952, Page 58]&lt;/ref&gt; in which, in writing on 'The photographers of the United Nations' he expressed the opinion that “The aim of the United Nations is identical with that which lies closest to the hearts of photographers: to bring the nations closer together through mutual understanding,”&lt;ref&gt;Fritz NEUGASS, “The photographers of the United Nations.” Camera, 1954, issue 9, page 405&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
Neugass became a member of the [[American Society of Media Photographers|American Society of Magazine Photographers]] and was exhibited in the Village Camera Club. He traveled to [[Mexico]] to make [[Ethnology|ethnological]] photographic documentation of rural life&lt;ref&gt;[http://luna.albany.edu/luna/servlet/view/search/what/Fritz+Neugass+Papers?q=neugass&amp;sort=archive_collection%2Cdate%2Ctitle%2Csubject&amp;os=0&amp;pgs=50 See University of Albany image search]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1953 which was shown in an exhibit at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in 1954. His photography was featured by [[Edward Steichen]] in two exhibitions at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]; ''Abstraction in Photography'', May 1–July 4, 1951 which featured his photographs of New York skyscrapers reflected in puddles, windows and on car duco, and [[The Family of Man|''The Family of Man'']] January 24–May 8, 1955, his contribution to the latter being made on [[Coney Island]] of swimsuit-clad couples embracing on the beach. The photograph later illustrated a 1979 book on body language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Givens, David B | author2=Center for Nonverbal Studies | title=The nonverbal dictionary of gestures, signs &amp; body language cues : from Adam's-apple-jump to zygomatic smile | publication-date=1998 | publisher=Center for Nonverbal Studies Press | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22295917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legacy==
Neugass' late work as a journalist included critical evaluations of the buying policy of the museums and strategies of the art market. Due to failing health, in January 1979, Neugass turned down their offer to be American editor for the German magazine ''Kunst''. He passed away in June. A memorial exhibit of Neugass' work was held on the 15th of October 1979 at [[Goethe-Institut, New York|Goethe House]] in New York City.

His estate is kept in the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]], New York and was compiled by Lotte Neugass (née Labus) prior to their deposit there in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections. There are approximately 4500 original photographs by Neugass in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://meg.library.albany.edu:8443/archive/view?docId=ger007.xml Fritz Neugass Papers 1913-1979, M.E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1598">In [[control theory]], '''gain scheduling''' is an approach to control of [[non-linear system]]s that uses a family of linear [[Controller (control theory)|controller]]s, each of which provides satisfactory control for a different operating point of the system.

One or more [[Observability|observable]] variables, called the ''scheduling variables'', are used to determine what operating region the system is currently in and to enable the appropriate linear controller.  For example, in an aircraft [[flight control system]], the [[altitude]] and [[Mach number]] might be the scheduling variables, with different linear controller parameters available (and automatically plugged into the controller) for various combinations of these two variables.

A relatively large scope state of the art about gain scheduling has been published in (Survey of Gain-Scheduling Analysis &amp; Design, D.J.Leith, WE.Leithead).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nuim.ie/1834/1/1001965764_link_19992.pdf|accessdate=1 November 2012|title=Survey of Gain-Scheduling Analysis &amp; Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gifted]] students are outstanding learners who are not usually considered risking academic failure or problems. However, gifted students can still [[Underachiever|underachieve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/siegle/publications/GCQDifferentiateUnderachieving.pdf | title=Factors That Differentiate Underachieving Gifted Students From High-Achieving Gifted Students | author=D. Betsy McCoach, Del Siegle | journal=Gifted Child Quarterly |date=Spring 2003 | volume=47 | issue=2 | pages=144-154 | doi=10.1177/001698620304700205}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are risks related to the student's giftedness. This concept was formally set forth in 1972 in the U.S. in the [[Marland report|Marland Report]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Gifted and talented children are, in fact, deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs served by the Office of Education.&lt;ref&gt;Marland, S. P., Jr. (1972). [http://www.valdosta.edu/colleges/education/psychology-and-counseling/documents/marland-report.pdf Education of the gifted and talented] Report to the Congress of the United States by the U.S. Commissioner of Education and background papers submitted to the U.S. Office of Education, 2 vols. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office. (Government Documents Y4.L 11/2: G36), pp. xi-xii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Specific risks==
At first glance, labeling gifted children ‘at-risk’ seems to be questionable to those who are unfamiliar with the research.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} However, the following risks are listed in ''The Social and Emotional Development of Gifted Children'':&lt;ref&gt;''The Social and Emotional Development of Gifted Children: What Do We Know?'', Edited by Maureen Neihart, Sally M. Reis, Nancy M. Robinson, and Sidney M. Moon; National Association of Gifted Children (Prufrock Press, Inc.), 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
* frustration, irritability, anxiety, tedium, and social isolation (p.&amp;nbsp;11)
* intense social isolation and stress among those with IQ greater than 160 (p.&amp;nbsp;14)
* difficulty making friends due to advanced concept of friendship, mostly among those less than age 10 (p.&amp;nbsp;23)
* de-motivation, low self-esteem, and social rejection among the exceptionally gifted (p.&amp;nbsp;26)
* emotional awareness beyond their ability to control (p.&amp;nbsp;34)
* difficulty with peer relations proportional to their IQ (p.&amp;nbsp;35)
* loneliness, anxieties, phobias, interpersonal problems, fear of failure, and perfectionism (p.&amp;nbsp;43)
* underachievement for social acceptance (p.&amp;nbsp;64)
* lack of resilience reinforced by easy work and well-intentioned but misguided praise (p.&amp;nbsp;65)
* increasing perfectionism throughout school years among girls (p.&amp;nbsp;75)
* fear of failure and risk avoidance due to perfectionism (p.&amp;nbsp;75)
* depression among creatively gifted (p.&amp;nbsp;93)

There is a cause-and-effect relationship between the unmet learning needs of gifted students and the above risks. “Research indicates that many of the emotional and social difficulties gifted students experience disappear when their educational climates are adapted to their level and pace of learning.”&lt;ref&gt;Neihart et al., p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linda Kreger Silverman enumerates these additional risks:&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, L.K. (1987). ‘Applying knowledge about social development to the counseling process with gifted adolescents.’ in T.M. Buescher (Ed.). ''Understanding Gifted and Talented Adolescents'' (pp. 40-44). Evanston, IL: The Center for Talent Development.&lt;/ref&gt;
* refusal to do routine, repetitive assignments 
* inappropriate criticism of others 
* lack of awareness of impact on others 
* difficulty accepting criticism
* hiding talents to fit in with peers 
* nonconformity and resistance to authority 
* poor study habits 

Further, there exists anecdotal evidence of truancy problems with gifted children, who sometimes miss school because of disengagement, and worse, fear of bullying.  In 1999, legislation was introduced in Colorado to recognize gifted students as at-risk, with truancy as a factor, but the bill did not become law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/sess1999/hbills99/hb1210.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

Lastly, meta-analysis from the paper “Gifted Students Who Drop Out—Who and Why: A Meta-Analytical Review of the Literature” by Kaskaloglu shows two key points.  First, 4.5% of high school dropouts are gifted, and they leave school in part because of school-related issues.&lt;ref&gt;Kaskaloglu, E. (2003). “Gifted Students Who Drop Out—Who and Why: A Meta-Analytical Review of the Literature”, Proceedings of the [[Hawaii International Conference on Education]].&lt;/ref&gt; To understand the drop out rate, one must consider that the study cited indicates the percentage of children who both dropped out and who scored above 130 on an IQ test. One would expect a very small percentage of such children to drop out, given the ease with which they can excel in school.  To expect more than one in ten would be hard to justify.  Therefore, with only 2.27% of people scoring above 130 on IQ tests, to expect greater than 0.227% of dropouts to be gifted would be ostensibly far-fetched.  Unfortunately, the actual percentage is closer to twenty times that.  According to the ''Achievement Trap'', this problem is even more pronounced among economically disadvantaged children.&lt;ref&gt;Wyner, J., Bridgeland, J., and DiIulio, Jr., J..  Achievement Trap: How America Is Failing Millions of High-Achieving Students from Lower-Income Families. Jack Kent Cooke Foundation &amp; Civic Enterprises, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance of Gifted Programs ==
The National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC) maintains that gifted students and those with outstanding abilities require gifted education programs. Such programs will serve as tests in actual classroom settings allowing these youngsters to sustain their progress while in school. Gifted programs can positive shape the future of these children. Some longitudinal or observational research studies demonstrated that these talented programs have positive effects on post-secondary plans of these kids&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nagc.org/resources-publications/gifted-education-practices/why-are-gifted-programs-needed|title=Why Are Gifted Programs Needed? {{!}} National Association for Gifted Children|website=www.nagc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iwh.on.ca/what-researchers-mean-by/cross-sectional-vs-longitudinal-studies|title=Cross-sectional vs. longitudinal studies {{!}} Institute for Work &amp; Health|website=www.iwh.on.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1996, American educational psychologists/educators Camila Benbow and Julian Stanley published a treatise that reviewed many years of evidence illustrating accomplishments of students with extreme intellectual potentials have declined significantly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.intelltheory.com/benbow.shtml|title=Human Intelligence: Camilla P. Benbow|website=www.intelltheory.com|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One of the major arguments of Benbow and Stanley pointed out the K-12 budget for federal education allocated a measly 0.0002 percent for gifted education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/a-nation-at-risk-how-gifted-low-income-kids-are-left-behind-56119|title=A nation at risk -- how gifted, low-income kids are left behind|last=Worrell|first=Frank C.|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

20 years later, another journal, Policy Insights from Behavioral and Brain Sciences published a paper showing this figure has not changed. In 2015, the budget for federal education was $49.8 billion with only 0.0002 percent apportioned to gifted education. Continuing inadequate investment in gifted children for several decades generated a massive gap between educational, leadership, and professional (work-related) attainment of low-income and high-income youngsters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.socialsciencespace.com/about-policy-insights-from-the-behavioral-and-brain-sciences/|title=About 'Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences' - Social Science Space|work=Social Science Space|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Jack Kent Cookie Foundation conducted an independent study in 2007 which established that endowed but low-income students fail to reach their full potentials. This Foundation maintains scholarship programs that motivate and support exceptional and hard-working students with financial issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/|title=Scholarship Programs {{!}} Jack Kent Cooke Foundation|website=www.jkcf.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Stanford University professor and Hoover fellow Caroline M. Hoxby and The Leadership Gift president Christopher Avery conducted a study on high achievers but belonging to financially deprived households and found out these young people do not attempt to enter the country’s top educational institutions. The New York Times (March 16, 2013) published an article that the two educators analyzed students who took the SAT standardized test the previous year. Based on that data, these researchers found out a low 34% of seniors with the highest scores in the bottom portion of income distribution enrolled one of the United States’ 238 most discriminating colleges&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hoover.org/news/hoxby-study-low-income-students-featured-new-york-times|title=Hoxby study on low-income students featured in New York Times|work=Hoover Institution|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

2018 statistics from the Department of Education revealed that demand for the Gifted and Talented Program continues to decline. Some 6.773 qualified children applied for possible positions in the Kindergarten through Third Grade program which is the lowest figure since 2014. The number is down 16 percent during that year when more than 8,000 students inquired about placement. The DOE’s position is this decline in applicants for said program comes from population transfer or contentment with zoned schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2018/06/01/number-of-applicants-for-does-gifted-and-talented-program-declines/|title=Number of applicants for DOE’s Gifted and Talented program declines|date=2018-06-02|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Harvard architecture.svg|thumb|Harvard architecture]]

The '''Harvard architecture''' is a [[computer architecture]] with physically separate [[computer storage|storage]] and signal pathways for [[Instruction (computing)|instruction]]s and data. The term originated from the [[Harvard Mark I]] relay-based computer, which stored instructions on [[punched tape]] (24 bits wide) and data in [[electro-mechanical]] counters. These early machines had data storage entirely contained within the [[central processing unit]], and provided no access to the instruction storage as data. Programs needed to be loaded by an operator; the processor could not [[Booting|initialize]] itself.

Today, most processors implement such separate signal pathways for performance reasons, but actually implement a [[modified Harvard architecture]], so they can support tasks like loading a program from [[disk storage]] as data and then executing it.

==Memory details==
In a Harvard architecture, there is no need to make the two memories share characteristics. In particular, the [[Word (computer architecture)|word]] width, timing, implementation technology, and [[memory address]] structure can differ. In some systems, instructions for pre-programmed tasks can be stored in [[read-only memory]] while data memory generally requires [[random-access memory|read-write memory]]. In some systems, there is much more instruction memory than data memory so instruction addresses are wider than data addresses.

===Contrast with von Neumann architectures===
{{Main|Von Neumann architecture}}
In a system with a pure [[von Neumann architecture]], instructions and data are stored in the same memory, so instructions are fetched over the same data path used to fetch data.  This means that a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cannot simultaneously read an instruction and read or write data from or to the memory. In a computer using the Harvard architecture, the CPU can both read an instruction and perform a data memory access at the same time,&lt;ref name="ddj1" &gt;"[http://www.drdobbs.com/386-vs-030-the-crowded-fast-lane/184407891?pgno=4 386 vs. 030: the Crowded Fast Lane]". ''Dr. Dobb's Journal'', January 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; even without a cache. A Harvard architecture computer can thus be faster for a given circuit complexity because [[instruction fetch]]es and data access do not contend for a single memory pathway.

Also, a Harvard architecture machine has distinct code and data address spaces: instruction address zero is not the same as data address zero.  Instruction address zero might identify a twenty-four bit value, while data address zero might indicate an eight-bit byte that is not part of that twenty-four bit value.

===Contrast with modified Harvard architecture===
{{Main|Modified Harvard architecture}}
A [[modified Harvard architecture]] machine is very much like a Harvard architecture machine, but it relaxes the strict separation between instruction and data while still letting the CPU concurrently access two (or more) memory buses. The most common modification includes separate instruction and data [[CPU cache|caches]] backed by a common address space.  While the CPU executes from cache, it acts as a pure Harvard machine.  When accessing backing memory, it acts like a von Neumann machine (where code can be moved around like data, which is a powerful technique). This modification is widespread in modern processors, such as the [[ARM architecture]], [[Power Architecture]] and [[x86]] processors.  It is sometimes loosely called a Harvard architecture, overlooking the  fact that it is actually "modified".

Another modification provides a pathway between the instruction memory (such as ROM or [[flash memory]]) and the CPU to allow words from the instruction memory to be treated as read-only data.  This technique is used in some microcontrollers, including the [[Atmel AVR]].  This allows constant data, such as [[text string]]s or [[function table]]s, to be accessed without first having to be copied into data memory, preserving scarce (and power-hungry) data memory for read/write variables.  Special [[machine language]] instructions are provided to read data from the instruction memory, or the instruction memory can be accessed using a peripheral interface{{note|The IAP lines of 8051-compatible microcontrollers from STC have dual ported Flash memory, with one of the two ports hooked to the instruction bus of the processor core, and the other port made available in the special function register region.}}.  (This is distinct from instructions which themselves embed constant data, although for individual constants the two mechanisms can substitute for each other.)

==Speed==
In recent years, the speed of the CPU has grown many times in comparison to the access speed of the main memory. Care needs to be taken to reduce the number of times main memory is accessed in order to maintain performance. If, for instance, every instruction run in the CPU requires an access to memory, the computer gains nothing for increased CPU speed—a problem referred to as being [[memory bound]].

It is possible to make extremely fast memory, but this is only practical for small amounts of memory for cost, power and signal routing reasons.  The solution is to provide a small amount of very fast memory known as a [[CPU cache]] which holds recently accessed data. As long as the data that the CPU needs are in the cache, the performance is much higher than it is when the CPU has to get the data from the main memory.

=== Internal vs. external design ===
Modern high performance CPU chip designs incorporate aspects of both Harvard and von Neumann architecture.  In particular, the "split cache" version of the [[modified Harvard architecture]] is very common.  CPU cache memory is divided into an instruction cache and a data cache. Harvard architecture is used as the CPU accesses the cache.  In the case of a cache miss, however, the data is retrieved from the main memory, which is not formally divided into separate instruction and data sections, although it may well have separate memory controllers used for concurrent access to RAM, ROM and (NOR) flash memory.

Thus, while a von Neumann architecture is visible in some contexts, such as when data and code come through the same memory controller, the hardware implementation gains the efficiencies of the Harvard architecture for cache accesses and at least some main memory accesses.

In addition, CPUs often have write buffers which let CPUs proceed after writes to non-cached regions. The von Neumann nature of memory is then visible when instructions are written as data by the CPU and software must ensure that the caches (data and instruction) and write buffer are synchronized before trying to execute those just-written instructions.

==Modern uses of the Harvard architecture==
The principal advantage of the pure Harvard architecture—simultaneous access to more than one memory system—has been reduced by modified Harvard processors using modern [[CPU cache]] systems.  Relatively pure Harvard architecture machines are used mostly in applications where trade-offs, like the cost and power savings from omitting caches, outweigh the programming penalties from featuring distinct code and data address spaces.

*[[Digital signal processors]] (DSPs) generally execute small, highly optimized audio or video processing algorithms. They avoid caches because their behavior must be extremely reproducible.  The difficulties of coping with multiple address spaces are of secondary concern to speed of execution. Consequently, some DSPs feature multiple data memories in distinct address spaces to facilitate [[SIMD]] and [[VLIW]] processing.  [[Texas Instruments TMS320]] C55x processors, for one example, feature multiple parallel data buses (two write, three read) and one instruction bus.
*[[Microcontrollers]] are characterized by having small amounts of program (flash memory) and data ([[Static random-access memory|SRAM]]) memory, and take advantage of the Harvard architecture to speed processing by concurrent instruction and data access.  The separate storage means the program and data memories may feature different bit widths, for example using 16-bit wide instructions and 8-bit wide data.  They also mean that [[instruction prefetch]] can be performed in parallel with other activities. Examples include the [[PIC microcontroller|PIC]] by [[Microchip Technology|Microchip Technology, Inc.]] and the [[Atmel AVR|AVR]] by [[Atmel|Atmel Corp]] (now part of Microchip Technology).

Even in these cases, it is common to employ special instructions in order to access program memory as though it were data for read-only tables, or for reprogramming; those processors are [[modified Harvard architecture]] processors.

'''Husk''' (or '''hull''') in [[botany]] is the outer shell or coating of a [[seed]]. It often refers to the leafy outer covering of an ear of [[maize]] (corn) as it grows on the plant. Literally, a husk or hull includes the protective outer covering of a seed, [[fruit]], or [[vegetable]]. It can also refer to the [[exuvia]] of bugs or small animals left behind after [[ecdysis|moulting]].

In [[cooking]], '''hull''' can also refer to other waste parts of fruits and vegetables, notably the cap or [[sepal]] of a [[strawberry]].

The husk of a [[legume]] and some similar fruits is called a '''pod'''.

Plantago-seed mucilage is often referred to as husk, or [[psyllium]] husk.

Crop plants of several species have been selected that have hulless seeds, including [[Pepita|pumpkins]], [[Oat|oats]], and [[barley]]. 

==Husking and dehulling==
{{One source|section|date=April 2018}}
Husking of corn is the process of removing its outer layers, leaving only the [[Maize|cob]] or seed rack of the corn. 
Dehulling is the process of removing the hulls (or [[chaff]]) from [[bean]]s and other [[seed]]s.  This is sometimes done using a machine known as a [[huller]]. To prepare the seeds to have [[oil]]s extracted from them, they are cleaned to remove any foreign objects.  Next, the seeds have their hulls, or outer coverings, or husk, removed.  There are three different types of dehulling systems that can be used to process [[soybean]]s: Hot dehulling, warm dehulling and cold dehulling. Hot dehulling is the system offered in areas where beans are processed directly from the field. Warm dehulling is often used by processors who import their soybeans. Cold dehulling is used in plants that have existing drying and conditioning equipment, but need to add dehulling equipment to produce high protein meal. The different dehulling [[temperature]] options are for different types of production, beans and preparation equipment.

In third-world countries, husking and dehulling is still often done by hand using a large [[mortar and pestle]]. These are usually made of wood, and operated by one or more people.

The husk is [[biodegradable]] and may be [[compost]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r17aBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA395&amp;dq=husk+is+biodegradable+and+composted.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFpvaV_4vVAhWLllQKHbfkC4sQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=husk%20is%20biodegradable%20and%20composted.&amp;f=false|title=Biomass Utilization|last=Cote|first=Wilfred|date=2013-12-01|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781475708332|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212184412/https://books.google.com/books?id=r17aBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA395&amp;dq=husk+is+biodegradable+and+composted.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFpvaV_4vVAhWLllQKHbfkC4sQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=husk%20is%20biodegradable%20and%20composted.&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-12-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">'''Josias Priest''' (''c.'' 1645 – 3 January 1735 in [[Chelsea, London]]) was an [[England|English]] dancer, dancing-master and [[Choreography|choreographer]].

==Biography==
In 1669, Priest was arrested along with four others for dancing and making music without a license. In 1668, he was a dancing-master in [[Holborn]], and in 1675 he moved to [[Leicester Fields]] to run a [[boarding school]] for [[Gentleman|gentlewomen]]. In 1680 he started a similar school at Gorge's House in [[Chelsea, London]]. Here Priest &lt;!--(sic)--&gt; hosted [[opera]]s, including [[John Blow]]'s ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]'' (1684) and [[Henry Purcell]]'s ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' (1689). It is widely believed that Priest choreographed dances for these and other semi-operas by Purcell, including ''[[Dioclesian]]'', ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'', ''[[The Indian Queen (opera)|The Indian Queen]]'', and ''[[King Arthur (opera)|King Arthur]]'' ; however, the evidence is not entirely conclusive. 

In 1699 [[Thomas Bray]] published a collection of dance music which included music for dances by Josias Priest and his son, Thomas Priest. Only one dance by Priest survives, a 'Minuet by Mr Preist'&lt;!--Please do not change this spelling, Preist is correct--&gt; in ''An Essay for the Further Improvement of Dancing'' (1711) published by Edmund Pemberton.  References to Priest's choreography remain in some musical sources, however.  The surviving minuet is for twelve women and uses a limited step vocabulary of [[minuet step]]s forwards, backwards and sideways, the main choreographic interest being in the floor patterns.  It is recorded in a simplified form of [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]] that was typically used for recording [[English country dance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=musdi&amp;fileName=134/musdi134.db&amp;recNum=32&amp;itemLink=r?ammem/musdibib:@field(NUMBER+@band(musdi+134)) facsimile of Priest's choreography] can be found at The Library of Congress' [[An American Ballroom Companion]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LGBT sex education''' refers to an educational program, most commonly found in schools, that addresses the [[sex education]] needs of [[LGBT|LGBT individuals]] and covers topics related to [[homosexuality]]. It is usually integrated into the general sex education courses (alongside [[heterosexual]] topics). There is disagreement about whether LGBT sex education should be included in [[sex education]] curricula. Advocates of LGBT sex education say that the inclusion of LGBT issues into sex education programs would reduce [[homophobia|homophobic]] bullying, improve the health of LGBT people, and decrease instances of problems common in LGBT students such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and low [[self-esteem]]. Opponents argue that LGBT sex education programs would force a political point of view on students, misuse tax money, and disrespect religious values. As of 2014, only 5% of middle and high schoolers in the United States reported receiving "positive discussions of LGBT-related topics" within their health classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tolerance.org/magazine/number-53-summer-2016/feature/new-sex-ed|title=The New Sex Ed {{!}} Teaching Tolerance - Diversity, Equity and Justice|website=www.tolerance.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-29|date=2016-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
LGBT sex education is currently not covered in many schools.&lt;ref name=Formby&gt;{{cite journal|last=Formby|first=Eleanor|title=Sex and relationships education, sexual health, and lesbian, gay and bisexual sexual cultures: views from young people|journal=Sex Education|date=August 2011|volume=11|issue=3|pages=255–266|doi=10.1080/14681811.2011.590078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also posited that students often don’t find existing LGBT sex education programs to be effective. Teachers have differing views on the subject of homosexuality, and these personal opinions can impact LGBT sex education when it is implemented.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Viv|author2=High |title=Something More to Tell You: Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual Young Peoples|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=April 2004|volume=30|issue=2|pages=213–225|doi=10.1080/0141192042000195281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research on LGBT sex education===

Multiple studies have concluded that LGBT sex education is often not encompassed in school sex education courses and that most students do not receive effective instruction in LGBT sex issues.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrow&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrow|first=Deana|title=Social Work with Gay and Lesbian Adolescents|journal=Social Work|date=November 1993|volume=38|issue=6|pages=655–660|accessdate=20 October 2013|url=https://academic.oup.com/sw/article-abstract/38/6/655/1880044|doi=10.1093/sw/38.6.655}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Ellis and High in the UK (2004), 384 students were surveyed; they found that 24% had not received instruction in LGBT sex issues.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; The CDC Division of Adolescent and School Health’s study revealed that 48% of schools in the US covered LGBT topics.&lt;ref name=SEICUS&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions and Answers: LGBTQ Youth Issues|url=http://www.siecus.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=605&amp;grandparentID=477&amp;parentID=591#teach|work=SEICUS|publisher=SEICUS|accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research reported by Burston and Hart in 2001, 45% of surveyed students believed that they did not cover LGBT sex education sufficiently in school. Research has also shown that there can be an implicit assumption that all students are heterosexual in sex education classes.&lt;ref name=Buston&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buston|first=Katie|author2=Hart |title=Heterosexism and homophobia in Scottish school sex education: exploring the nature of the problem|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=February 2001|volume=4|issue=1|pages=95–109|doi=10.1006/jado.2000.0366|pmid=11259073}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LGBT students in Eleanor Formby’s 2011 study of sex education said that they do not always feel welcomed by sex education classes or at school.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; Sex education courses commonly idealize marriage (not acknowledging that many countries outlaw same-sex marriage) thereby presenting a heterosexual view of sex and relationships as normal.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; Studies have suggested that sex education programs often do not cover safe sex practices for LGBT individuals.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;&lt;ref name=CSW&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanchez |first=Marisol |title=Providing inclusive sex education in schools will address the health needs of LGBT Youth |url=http://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/policy-briefs/policy-briefs/CSWPolicyBrief11.pdf |publisher=Center for the Study of Women UCLA |accessdate=October 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102525/https://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/policy-briefs/policy-briefs/CSWPolicyBrief11.pdf |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are some sex education curricula that do cover LGBT issues.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; For example, the [[Unitarian Universalist Association|Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations]] provides a sex education program called [[Our Whole Lives]], which includes discussion of sexual orientation and presents homosexuality and heterosexuality as equally valid. Our Whole Lives offers programs designed for a range of developmental stages, from Kindergarten-level through adulthood, and follows the "Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education" that the [[Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States]] (SIECUS) endorses.&lt;ref name=UUAC&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Whole Lives Lifespan Sexuality Education Curricula|url=http://www.uua.org/re/owl/|work=Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCC&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Whole Lives|url=http://www.ucc.org/justice/sexuality-education/our-whole-lives.html|work=The United Church of Christ|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Church of Christ]] also supports Our Whole Lives.&lt;ref name=UCC/&gt;

==Issues with Current Sex Education Programs==

Research has  illustrated that some sex education courses present LGBT issues in a negative light—portraying LGBT individuals and LGBT sexuality as something wrong, sick, and abnormal.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; According to the American Civil Liberties Union, “[[Abstinence-only sex education|Abstinence-only]]” approaches to sex education can also be alienating to LGBT students because these programs assume that marriage is a possibility and a desire for all students; however, same-sex marriage is illegal in many countries.&lt;ref name="ACLU"&gt;{{cite web|last=American Civil Liberties Union|title=Helping Teens Make Healthy and Responsible Decisions About Sex|url=https://www.aclu.org/reproductive-freedom/helping-teens-make-healthy-and-responsible-decisions-about-sex|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, promoting marriage as the goal for LGBT students reproduces a [[homonormative]] standard, marginalizing those without access to or interest in marriage.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexuality in School: the Limits of Education|last=Gilbert|first=Jen|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis and High’s survey research in 2004 (including 384 students) revealed that 59% of young people who did receive LGBT sex education found it to be ineffective.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;

===Teachers===

Teachers have been identified as a hindrance to LGBT sex education in some studies. Teachers always have their own opinions about homosexuality, and, according to these studies, if teachers have negative views toward LGBT individuals this can come through in their teaching—causing LGBT students to feel unaccepted and unsafe.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; According to Ellis and High (2004), when LGBT students receive information about LGBT sexuality with negative undertones they are left feeling significantly worse and more unsafe than if homosexuality were left out of the curriculum.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt; Researchers have documented multiple self-proclaimed "LGBT-friendly" teachers whose classrooms actually foster prejudiced lessons. Such teachers are also highly likely to ignore instances of homophobic bullying directed at LGBT youth within their classes.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; Burston and Hart (2001) reported that teachers sometimes believe that they should not take a side on the issue of homosexuality, and therefore should not interfere when homophobia occurs in the classroom.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; According to Formby (2011), even phrasing that subtly casts homosexuality in a negative light can have a detrimental effect on LGBT students’ experience of sex education.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;

There have also been issues around teachers feeling free to teach sex education that equally emphasizes both heterosexual and homosexual health information.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; Deana Morrow’s study (1993) reported that some teachers said they were afraid they might be fired if they discussed LGBT issues.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; This fear is linked to the historical misconnection of homosexuality to molestation in the United States; this supposedly natural linkage has been debunked multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blount|first=JM|date=|title=The Historical Regulation of Sexuality and Gender of Students and Teachers|url=|journal=Youth and Sexualities|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, straight and LGBT teachers alike still experience allegations of molestation when they engage in discussions surrounding sexuality, particularly those discussions that are LGBT related.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"/&gt; Teachers can also feel hindered because the school environment is inhospitable to homosexuality; in Burston and Hart’s 2001 study, some even said that they were under the impression that the school would not allow them to teach LGBT sex education.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt;

Classmates can also be non-receptive toward LGBT issues in current sex education courses, and students are often hesitant to talk about homosexuality, according to Buston and Hart (2001).&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt;

=== Home ===
Since sex education has been present in health education in schools, many parents expect their children to learn about sex there.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Estes|first=Michelle L.|date=2017-03-09|title=“If There’s One Benefit, You’re not Going to Get Pregnant”: the Sexual Miseducation of Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Individuals|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-017-0749-8|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=77|issue=9-10|pages=615–627|doi=10.1007/s11199-017-0749-8|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;Studies show that most families do not engage in conversation about sex in the home, and when they do it is often from a heternormative perspective. The assumptions of being heterosexual can make LGBT people feel ashamed or lacking support from their family. Lack of conversation and knowledge received in the home for LGBT people can often lead them to receive their information for outside sources.[[File:Rainbow Heart 181x182.png|thumbnail|The rainbow heart symbolizes LGB relationships]]

==Proposed LGBT sex education programs==
Advocates for LGBT sex education have suggested adjustments to current sex education practices in schools. One common place for improvement that researchers have identified is the angle from which sex education is approached in general. Buston and Hart (2001), Ellis and High (2004), and others have recommended that teachers frame sex education in terms of relationships rather than merely reproduction, which can lead to the exclusion of LGBT students.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; Ellis and High mention that sexual orientation might be more appropriately taught as “an aspect of culture and identity” (Ellis and High 2004, pg. 11).&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt; Other researchers such as Morrow (1993) believe that in order for sex education to be effective, it must present LGB as just as natural and legitimate as heterosexuality.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; Advocates for LGBT sex education ask that LGBT sexual health issues be given equal weight in the curriculum accordingly.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt; They also say that more resources concerning LGBT sexual health issues need to be made available to students.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; According to [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]'s Center for the Study of Women’s Policy Brief 11 (2012), LBGT students may not be willing to reach out for guidance themselves.&lt;ref name=CSW/&gt;

Researchers have recommended that teachers in sex education programs avoid framing homosexuality as something that is fundamentally connected to sexually transmitted diseases and refrain from practices that are potentially detrimental to LGBT students, such as referring to partners as specifically “him” or “her” (better to use the more flexible “they”).&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt;  Gowen and Winges-Yanez (2014) suggest through their focus groups on LGBT teens that there are several problems with the way sex education is taught.  The teens cited silencing, heterocentricity, and pathologizing of LGBT individuals as common practices.  When asked how they would improve sex education, the group said inclusive sex education would include discussion of LGBT issues, learning how to access resources, [[Sexually Transmitted Infection|STI]] prevention, relationships, and anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gowen | last2 = Winges-Yanez | year = 2014 | title = Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning youths' perspectives of inclusive school-based sexuality education | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 51 | issue = 7| pages = 788–800 | pmid = 24003908 | doi=10.1080/00224499.2013.806648}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocates for LGBT rights also say that teachers need to abandon any reluctance to take a side in the debate about homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;

There are also alternative sexual education programs for LGBT people, such as that of an online sexual education course. According to a study evaluating the effectiveness of an online, interactive sexual education program for LGBT people, all subsections recorded statistically significant improvement of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mustanski|first=Brian|last2=Greene|first2=George J.|last3=Ryan|first3=Daniel|last4=Whitton|first4=Sarah W.|date=2014-03-03|title=Feasibility, Acceptability, and Initial Efficacy of an Online Sexual Health Promotion Program for LGBT Youth: The Queer Sex Ed Intervention|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2013.867924|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|language=en|volume=52|issue=2|pages=220–230|doi=10.1080/00224499.2013.867924|issn=0022-4499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the topics included safe sex practices, healthy relationships, pleasure and sexually transmitted infections. This type of program also created an online community for people taking the course to ask questions and interact with each other. This social aspect of the program also created a sense of normalcy and acceptance. Online programs could offer a means of education for those who cannot receive it in school.

==Support for LGBT sex education==
Proponents of incorporating LGBT sex education into school curricula commonly present several arguments. According to the [[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]], some supporters claim that failing to include LGBT issues in sex education programs will overlook a significant number of students who identify as LGBT;&lt;ref name=HP&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodman|first=Josh|title=5 Reasons Schools Should Adopt LGBTQ-inclusive Sex Ed|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-a-goodman/lgbtq-inclusive-sex-ed_b_3834914.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2013-11-02|date=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Center for American Progress]] (CAP) says that this can cause them to feel marginalized and removed from the lesson because it doesn’t pertain to them.&lt;ref name=CAP&gt;{{cite web|last=Slater|first=Hannah|title=LGBT-Inclusive Sex Education Means Healthier Youth and Safer Schools|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2013/06/21/67411/lgbt-inclusive-sex-education-means-healthier-youth-and-safer-schools/|work=Center for American Progress|accessdate=2013-11-02|date=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT sex education advocates also argue that leaving LGBT safe sex instruction out of the curriculum will increase the likelihood of health problems for LGBT students.&lt;ref name=CSW/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt; Supporters say that since LGBT people are particularly at risk for [[HIV/AIDS]], it is especially important to provide them with sexual health information.&lt;ref name="Pink News"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Scott|title=National AIDS Trust welcomes Labour's call for LGBT inclusive sex education|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/06/10/national-aids-trust-welcomes-labours-call-for-lgbt-inclusive-sex-education/|work=Pink News|accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to researcher Eleanor Formby (2011), lesbian women are a high-risk group for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs), because many do not know that they can be susceptible to STDs or how to engage in safe sex. Therefore, it is important that they receive lesbian sex education.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; LGBT sex education advocates suggest that because LGBT students aren’t taught sex education that pertains to them in school, they feel unprepared for sex, unable to talk about it openly, and have to learn about it by themselves—which can result in negative health outcomes.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt; Sanchez (2012) argues that LGBT students are unlikely to reach out to resources that could give them good information on their own, which furthers the need for LGBT sex education in schools.&lt;ref name=CSW/&gt;

[[File:Showing your pride - DC Gay Pride Parade 2012 (7356403050).jpg|thumbnail|Parade attendees wave rainbow flags at the 2012 Washington, D.C. Capital Pride parade]]

LGBT sex education supporters have also argued that the inclusion of LGBT topics in the curriculum can decrease instances of bullying in schools by familiarizing students with the range of [[sexual orientation]]s and reducing harmful [[stereotype]]s.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=HP/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt; The Center for American Progress argues that LGBT sex education results in a decrease in homophobic comments. According to the Huffington Post, supporters say that educating young people about LGBT individuals could help them have a more positive attitude toward their gay peers.&lt;ref name=HP/&gt; The Center for American Progress (2013) says that LGBT sex education would therefore reduce common problems LGBT students face as a result of negative attitudes; these include mental health issues like depression, the risk of suicide, drug abuse, self-esteem issues, and poorer academic performance due to stress caused by discrimination. They argue that covering homosexuality in sex education programs helps students feel more secure at school.&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;

According to Jen Gilbert, associate professor of education at York University, LGBT kids often do not have queer parents who they can ask for sexuality-related advice, nor access to LGBT adults. LGBT sex education could potentially fill this gap and provide LGBT students with elders well-versed in their specific needs and equipped with affirming information, that students are otherwise unable to receive at home or in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexuality in School: the Limits of Education|last=Gilbert|first=Jen|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, proponents of LGBT sex education have said that curricula that explore all facets of sexuality would be beneficial to straight students as well, because they claim that it presents a more accurate picture of the world and human sexuality. A study of Gay/Straight Alliances in Utah found that peer-facilitated discussions concerning the spectrum of sexuality and gender identities benefitted both straight and LGBT students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Camille|date=February–March 2002|title=The Impact of Belonging to a High School Gay/Straight Alliance|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/13897/summary|journal=The High School Journal|volume=85|issue=3|pages=13–26|doi=10.1353/hsj.2002.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It exposed them to the reality of relationships outside of the heteronormative images that dominate media (as well as sex education), and even positively impacted all involved students' academic performance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Proponents also argue that offering LGBT-inclusive sex education can be of major assistance to any questioning students that might be in the class.&lt;ref name=HP/&gt;

According to the Center for American Progress (2013), the majority of parents support including homosexuality in the sex education curriculum; they report that 73% of high school parents think LGBT issues should be taught. The CAP claims that this high percentage of support indicates that LGBT topics should be incorporated.&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;

==Opposition to LGBT sex education==
Opponents of LGBT sex education argue that it is wrong to teach students about the issue of homosexuality because it is too contentious. They say that parents should have control over what their children are exposed to and taught, and allowing public schools to cover LGBT sex education would undermine this right, forcing a particular political view on students. According to the [[The Christian Post|Christian Post]], some parents do not want their children to study homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Christian Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/sex-education-in-schools-should-include-a-gay-agenda-report-claims-66976/|title=Sex Education in Schools Should Include a Gay Agenda, Report Claims|last=Villalva|first=Brittney|work=The Christian Post|accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics often cite a misuse of citizens' tax dollars; claiming citizens' should not have to pay for children to learn about other lifestyles that their parents do not agree with.&lt;ref name="Moran"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moran|first=Joe|date=1 February 2001|title=Childhood Sexualities and Education: The Case of Section 28|journal=Sexualities|volume=4|issue=1|pages=73–89|doi=10.1177/136346001004001004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Formby (2011), opponents have also argued that LGBT sex education is harmful to students because they say it exposes them to damaging information.&lt;ref name=Formby/&gt; They claim that the students should not learn about LGBT issues until they are older.&lt;ref name="Christian Post" /&gt; Some opponents of LGBT sex education have argued that including LGBT issues in sex education programs will encourage more young people to practice homosexuality as well.&lt;ref name="Morrow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/09/education/09clash.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=Gay Rights Battlefields Spread to Public Schools|last=Janofsky|first=Michael|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2013-11-02|date=2005-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
LGBT sex education has also been accused of being disrespectful to certain families’ religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The Christian Post argued that if schools elect to teach about LGBT people while neglecting religious topics, the curriculum would be unfairly balanced.&lt;ref name="Christian Post" /&gt;

There have also been concerns that LGBT sex education wouldn’t be effective because it is difficult for homophobic students to accept homosexuality, which may prevent them from being receptive to the instruction.&lt;ref name=Buston/&gt;

=== Opposition within the United States ===
Four states (Alabama, South Carolina, Texas, Utah) mandate pointedly negative messages regarding all LGBT identities, when sex education is provided.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education|title=Sex and HIV Education|date=2016-03-14|work=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2017-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight states prohibit discussion of any topics deemed LGBT-related.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to the Guttmacher Institute's findings in 2017, "If HIV education is taught in Arizona it cannot "promote" a "homosexual lifestyle" or portray homosexuality in a positive manner. Mandated HIV education in Oklahoma teaches that among other behaviors that 'homosexual activity' is considered to be 'responsible for contact with the AIDS virus'."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Laws and legal battles==

===Section 28===
{{Main|Section 28}}
Section 28 was a controversial law in the United Kingdom that barred schools from presenting homosexuality as a viable sexual orientation or basis for relationships (though the law was never used in court).&lt;ref name="Moran" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Browne&gt;{{cite news|last=Browne|first=Daniel|title=The Lasting Legacy of Section 28|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-browne/the-lasting-legacy-of-section-28_b_4259545.html|accessdate=2013-11-24|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was enacted in 1988 and repealed throughout the UK by 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Section 28 Timeline|url=http://politics.theguardian.com/homeaffairs/page/0,11026,875944,00.html#top|accessdate=2013-11-24|newspaper=The Guardian|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Section 28 say that the law prevented teachers from intervening in instances of homophobic bullying and greatly hindered the development of gay rights in Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Browne/&gt; According to Moran (2001), proponents of the law argued that it protected students from being harmed by gay propaganda.&lt;ref name=Moran/&gt; Recently, LGBT advocates have raised concerns that policies similar to Section 28 are appearing again in British schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Nigel|title=The return of Section 28: Schools and academies practising homophobic policy that was outlawed under Tony Blair|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-return-of-section-28-schools-and-academies-practising-homophobic-policy-that-was-outlawed-under-tony-blair-8775249.html|accessdate=2013-11-24|newspaper=The Independent|date=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatian textbook===
In 2009, the European Committee of Social Rights found several statements in a Croatian mandatory Biology course textbook, including: “Many individuals are prone to sexual relations with persons of the same sex…. It is believed that parents are to blame because they impede their children’s correct sexual development with their irregularities in family relations. Nowadays it has become evident that homosexual relations are the main culprit for increased spreading of sexually transmitted diseases (e.g. AIDS),” and “The disease [AIDS] has spread amongst promiscuous groups of people who often change their sexual partners. Such people are homosexuals because of sexual contacts with numerous partners, drug addicts...and prostitutes.” The European Committee of Social Rights deemed these statements discriminatory and in violation of Croatia's obligations under the [[European Social Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/socialcharter/Complaints/CC45Merits_en.pdf|title=The European Social Charter|website=European Social Charter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Longhua Temple''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|龙|华|寺}}|t={{linktext|龍|華|寺}}|p={{linktext|Lóng|húa| Sì}}''; &lt;small&gt;[[Shanghainese]]&lt;/small&gt;:'' Lon-ngu-zy}}, literally ''"[[Lustre (mineralogy)|Lustre]] of the [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]] Temple''") is a [[Buddhist temple]] dedicated to the [[Maitreya|Maitreya Buddha]] located in [[Shanghai]]. Although most of the present-day buildings date from later reconstructions, the temple preserves the architectural design of a [[Song dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) monastery of the [[Chinese Chán|Chan School]]. It is the largest, most authentic and complete ancient temple complex in the city of Shanghai.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

==History==
[[Image:Longhua temple1.JPG|right|thumb|Newly constructed front gate of Longhua. The site of the original gates, further in front, is now marked by two standing pillars and a set of original stone lions.]]

The temple was first built in 242 AD, during the [[Three Kingdoms Period]] (220&amp;ndash;165). According to a legend, [[Sun Quan]], King of the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]] (222&amp;ndash;280), had obtained [[Ringsel|Sharira]] relics, which are cremated remains of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. To house these precious relics, the king ordered the construction of 13 pagodas. Longhua Pagoda ({{zh|s=龙华塔|t=|labels=no}}), part of the Longhua temple complex, is said to have been one of them. Like the function of the pagoda, the name of the temple also has its origin in a local legend according to which a dragon once appeared on the site.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

The temple was destroyed by war towards the end of the [[Tang dynasty]] (618&amp;ndash;907) and rebuilt in 977 AD, under the autonomous Kingdom of [[Wuyue]] during the [[Song dynasty|Northern Song dynasty]] period (960&amp;ndash;1127). (According to another version of the story, as contained in [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) and [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271&amp;ndash;1368) local histories, the temple was first built by the King of [[Wuyue]].) Later in the Song dynasty, in 1064, it was renamed "Kongxiang Temple" ({{zh|s=空相寺|t=|labels=no}}), but the original name "Longhua Temple" was restored in the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368&amp;ndash;1644) during the reign of the [[Wanli Emperor]] (1573&amp;ndash;1620).

The present architectural design follows the [[Song dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279) original. However, whereas the core of the present Longhua Pagoda survives from that period, most buildings in the temple proper were rebuilt during the reigns of the [[Tongzhi Emperor]] (1862&amp;ndash;1874) and the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (1875&amp;ndash;1908) in the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644&amp;ndash;1911). A modern restoration of the entire temple complex was carried out in 1954.

The temple and monastery were originally surrounded by extensive gardens and orchards. Viewing of the peach blossom in the Longhua gardens was an annual attraction for people in surrounding cities.

The temple grounds have been used as a site for internment as well as for executions. Public executions were held on the site in the 19th century. In 1927, the [[Kuomintang]] carried out a purge of suspected communists in Shanghai. Thousands of victims of this purge were brought to the temple grounds to be executed. They are commemorated today by the Longhua Martyrs Cemetery behind the temple. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] operated their largest civilian internment camp in the area, where [[United States|American]], [[Great Britain|British]], as well as nationals of other [[Allies of World War II|allied countries]] were held under poor conditions.

The temple's extensive gardens have since been almost entirely absorbed into the neighbouring Longhua Martyrs Cemetery and have been extensively reconstructed in a contemporary monumental style. A small traditional garden remains immediately adjacent to the temple buildings.

==Architectural design and artwork==
[[Image:500lohan longhuatemple.jpg|right|thumb|Statues of the 500 arhats]]
[[Image:Longhua Pagoda.JPG|thumb|right|The exterior of the Longhua Pagoda]]

The Longhua Temple occupies an area of more than {{Convert|20000|m2|sqft|-3}} and the main axis of the compound is {{Convert|194|m|ft}} long. The tallest structure is the Longhua Pagoda which stands {{Convert|40.4|m|ftin}} high.

The layout of the temple is that of a Song dynasty monastery of the Buddhist Chan sect, known as the ''Sangharama Five-Hall Style''. Five main halls are arranged along a central north-south pointing axis. From the entrance, the buildings are:

===Maitreya Hall===
The Maitreya Hall housing a statue of [[Maitreya]] buddha and another in his manifestation as "[[Budai]]", or ''Cloth bag monk''.

===Four Heavenly Kings Hall===
The [[Four Heavenly Kings Hall]] housing statues of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]].

===Mahavira Hall===
The [[Mahavira Hall]] is the main hall, housing statues of the historical Buddha ([[Shakyamuni]]) and two disciples. At the back of the hall is a bas-relief carving, including a depiction of [[Guanyin]], or the Buddistava [[Avalokiteśvara]] in his female manifestation. Around the front portion are arranged the twenty Guardians of Buddhist Law, and around the back the sixteen principal [[arhat]]s. The hall also features an ancient bell cast in 1586, during the [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] era of the [[Ming dynasty]].

===Three Sages Hall===
The Three Sages Hall ({{zh|s=三圣殿|t=|labels=no}}) houses statues of the [[Amitabha]] buddha, and the Buddistavas [[Avalokiteśvara]] (male form) and Mahāsthāmaprāpta.

===Abbot's Hall===
The Abbot's Hall ({{zh|s=方丈室|t=|labels=no}}) is a place for lectures and formal meetings.

===Bell tower and Drum tower===
A Bell Tower and a Drum Tower are arranged off the central axis. The Bell Tower houses a copper [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] cast in 1382, the bell is {{convert|2|m|adj=on}} tall, has a maximum diameter of {{convert|1.3|m|adj=on}}, and weighs {{convert|5000|kg|adj=on}}. The bell is used in the ''Evening Bell-Striking Ceremony'' conducted on New Year's Eve. Also situated off the main axis is a shrine to [[Ksitigarbha]] (Dizang the King Bodhissatva).

===Buddhist Texts Library===
The [[Buddhist Texts Library]] houses various versions of Buddhist [[sutra]]s and other Buddhist works, as well as ceremonial instruments, antiques, and artefacts.

Artworks in the temple include statues of the Maitreya Buddha in his [[Bodhisattva]] form and in his ''Cloth Bag Monk'' incarnation, statues of the [[Eighteen Arhats]] and 20 Guardians of Buddhist Law, as well as statues of the 500 [[arhat]]s.

===Longhua Pagoda===
[[Image:Longhuata300x400.jpg|right|thumb|Longhua Pagoda]]

The Longhua Pagoda is best well-known of the 16 historic pagodas that still stand within the Shanghai municipality. It has an octagonal floor layout. The size of the seven storeys decreases from the bottom to the top. The pagoda consists of a hollow, tube-like brick core surrounded by a wooden staircase. On the outside, it is decorated with balconies, banisters, and upturned eaves. These outer decorations have been reconstructed in keeping with the original style.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

Although previous pagodas existed on the same site, the current brick base and body of the pagoda was built in 977 under the [[Wuyue]] kingdome (907&amp;ndash;978), with continuous renovations of its more fragile wooden components on the exterior. Because of its age, the pagoda is fragile and is not open to the public.{{sfnb|Zi Yan|2012|p=78&amp;ndash;79}}

==Temple fair==
The Longhua Temple Fair has been held since the [[Ming dynasty]] annually on the third day of the third month of the [[Lunar Calendar]], when - according to local legend - the dragons visit the temple to help grant the people's wishes. It coincides with the blossoming of the peach trees in Longhua Park. Since its inception, the fair has been an annual event interrupted only by the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS]] outbreak.

==Location==
The Longhua Temple is located on the Longhua area (formerly Longhua township) of Shanghai (named after the temple). Its street address is No. 2853 Longhua Road (Longhua Lu). It is open to the public for a fee (10 [[Renminbi|RMB]]) which includes incense.{{Citation needed|reason=I didn't get any incense! (2 January 2010)|date=January 2010}}

==In popular culture==
[[J.G. Ballard]] in his World War II-era autobiographical novel ''[[Empire of the Sun]]'' describes the Japanese military use of the Longhua pagoda as a flak cannon tower.  In Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of the book, the pagoda is clearly visible above the prison camp.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In [[flight dynamics]], '''longitudinal static stability''' is the stability of an aircraft in the longitudinal, or pitching, plane under [[steady flight]] conditions. This characteristic is important in determining whether a [[Aviator|human pilot]] will be able to control the aircraft in the pitching plane without requiring excessive attention or excessive strength.&lt;ref name=LJC16&gt;Clancy, L.J. (1975) ''Aerodynamics'', Chapter 16, Pitman Publishing Limited, London. {{ISBN|0-273-01120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Static stability ==
[[File:Aircraft static longitudinal stability.svg|400px|thumbnail|Three cases for static stability: following a pitch disturbance, aircraft can be either unstable, neutral, or stable.]]

As any vehicle moves it will be subjected to minor changes in the forces that act on it, and in its speed.
* If such a change causes further changes that tend to restore the vehicle to its original speed and orientation, without human or machine input, the vehicle is said to be statically stable. The aircraft has positive stability.
* If such a change causes further changes that tend to drive the vehicle away from its original speed and orientation, the vehicle is said to be statically unstable.  The aircraft has negative stability.
* If such a change causes no tendency for the vehicle to be restored to its original speed and orientation, and no tendency for the vehicle to be driven away from its original speed and orientation, the vehicle is said to be neutrally stable.  The aircraft has zero stability.

For a vehicle to possess positive static stability it is not necessary for its speed and orientation to return to exactly the speed and orientation that existed before the minor change that caused the upset.  It is sufficient that the speed and orientation do not continue to diverge but undergo at least a small change back towards the original speed and orientation.

== Longitudinal stability ==
The longitudinal stability of an aircraft refers to the aircraft's stability in the pitching plane - the plane which describes the position of the aircraft's nose in relation to its tail and the horizon.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;  (Other stability modes are [[directional stability]] and lateral stability.)

If an aircraft is longitudinally stable, a small increase in [[angle of attack]] will cause the [[pitching moment]] on the aircraft to change so that the angle of attack decreases.  Similarly, a small decrease in angle of attack will cause the pitching moment to change so that the angle of attack increases.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;

== The pilot's task ==
The pilot of an aircraft with positive longitudinal stability, whether it is a human pilot or an [[autopilot]], has an easy task to fly the aircraft and maintain the desired pitch attitude which, in turn, makes it easy to control the speed, angle of attack and [[fuselage]] angle relative to the horizon.  The pilot of an aircraft with negative longitudinal stability has a more difficult task to fly the aircraft.  It will be necessary for the pilot devote more effort, make more frequent inputs to the elevator control, and make larger inputs, in an attempt to maintain the desired pitch attitude.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;

Most successful aircraft have positive longitudinal stability, providing the aircraft's [[center of gravity]] lies within the approved range.  Some acrobatic and combat aircraft have low-positive or neutral stability to provide high maneuverability.  Some advanced aircraft have a form of low-negative stability called [[relaxed stability]] to provide extra-high maneuverability.

== Center of gravity ==
The longitudinal static stability of an aircraft is significantly influenced by the distance (moment arm or lever arm) between the [[centre of gravity]] (c.g.) and the [[aerodynamic centre]] of the airplane.  The c.g. is established by the design of the airplane and influenced by its loading, as by payload, passengers, etc.  The aerodynamic centre (a.c.) of the airplane can be located approximately by taking the algebraic sum of the plan-view areas fore and aft of the c.g. multiplied by their blended moment arms and divided by their areas, in a manner analogous to the method of locating the c.g. itself.  In conventional aircraft, this point is aft of, but close to, the one-quarter-chord point of the wing.  In unconventional aircraft, e.g. the [[Rutan Quickie|Quickie]], it is between the two wings because the aft wing is so large.  The pitching moment at the a.c. is typically negative and constant.

The a.c. of an airplane typically does not change with loading or other changes; but the c.g. does, as noted above.  If the c.g. moves forward, the airplane becomes more stable (greater moment arm between the a.c. and the c.g.), and if too far forward will cause the airplane to be difficult for the pilot to bring nose-up as for landing.  If the c.g. is too far aft, the moment arm between it and the a.c. diminishes, reducing the inherent stability of the airplane and in the extreme going negative and rendering the airplane longitudinally unstable; see the diagram below.

Accordingly, the operating handbook for every airplane specifies the range over which the c.g. is permitted to move.  Inside this range, the airplane is considered to be inherently stable, which is to say that it will self-correct longitudinal (pitch) disturbances without pilot input.&lt;ref&gt;"The slope of the pitching moment curve [as a function of lift coefficient] has come to be the criterion of static longitudinal stability." Perkins and Hage, ''Airplane Performance, Stability, and Control'', Wiley, 1949, p. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
&lt;!-- The following material was cut from [[Pitching moment]] and pasted here when this article (Longitudinal static stability) was created on 10 Dec 2007.  To see the history of the following material go to [[Pitching moment]] and view the history prior to 10 Dec 2007.--&gt;
Near the cruise condition most of the lift force is generated by the wings, with ideally only a small amount generated by the fuselage and tail. We may analyse the longitudinal static stability by considering the aircraft in [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] under wing lift, tail force, and weight.  The moment equilibrium condition is called [[trim (aircraft)|trim]], and we are generally interested in the longitudinal stability of the aircraft about this trim condition.

[[File:AirStability.svg]]

Equating [[force]]s in the vertical direction:
:&lt;math&gt;W=L_w+L_t&lt;/math&gt;
where W is the weight, &lt;math&gt;L_w&lt;/math&gt; is the wing lift and &lt;math&gt;L_t&lt;/math&gt; is the tail force.  

For a thin airfoil at low [[angle of attack]], the wing lift is proportional to the angle of attack:
:&lt;math&gt;L_w=qS_w\frac{\partial C_L}{\partial \alpha} (\alpha-\alpha_0)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is the wing area &lt;math&gt;C_L&lt;/math&gt; is the (wing) [[lift coefficient]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of attack.  The term &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0&lt;/math&gt; is included to account for camber, which results in lift at zero angle of attack. Finally &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dynamic pressure]]:
:&lt;math&gt;q=\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[air density]] and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the speed.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins and Hage, ''Airplane Performance, Stability, and Control'', Wiley, NY, 1949, p. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This ref has been dropped in here as the best place for it, but somebody needs to check that it does bear out the above analysis --&gt;

===Trim===
The force from the tailplane is proportional to its angle of attack, including the effects of any elevator deflection and any adjustment the pilot has made to trim-out any stick force.  In addition, the tail is located in the flow field of the main wing, and consequently experiences  [[downwash]], reducing its angle of attack. 

In a statically stable aircraft of conventional (tail in rear) configuration, the [[tailplane]] force may act upward or downward depending on the design and the flight conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = BRA | last = Burns | title = Canards: Design with Care | newspaper = Flight International | date = 23 February 1985 | pages = 19–21 | quote = It is a misconception that tailed aeroplanes always carry tailplane downloads. They usually do, with flaps down and at forward c.g. positions, but with flaps up at the c.g. aft, tail loads at high lift are frequently positive (up), although the tail's maximum lifting capability is rarely approached.}}.[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200561.html p.19][http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200562.html p.20][http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200563.html p.21]&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical canard aircraft both fore and aft planes are lifting surfaces. The fundamental requirement for static stability is that the aft surface must have greater authority (leverage) in restoring a disturbance than the forward surface has in exacerbating it.  This leverage is a product of moment arm from the center of mass and surface area. Correctly balanced in this way, the partial derivative of pitching moment with respect to changes in angle of attack will be negative: a momentary pitch up to a larger angle of attack makes the resultant pitching moment tend to pitch the aircraft back down. (Here, pitch is used casually for the angle between the nose and the direction of the airflow; angle of attack.) This is the "stability derivative" d(M)/d(alpha), described below. 

The tail force is, therefore:
:&lt;math&gt; L_t=q S_t\left(\frac{\partial C_l}{\partial \alpha}\left(\alpha-\frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial \alpha}\alpha\right)+\frac{\partial C_l}{\partial \eta}\eta\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S_t\!&lt;/math&gt; is the tail area, &lt;math&gt;C_l\!&lt;/math&gt; is the tail force coefficient, &lt;math&gt;\eta\!&lt;/math&gt; is the elevator deflection, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\!&lt;/math&gt; is the downwash angle.

A canard aircraft may have its foreplane rigged at a high angle of incidence, which can be seen in a canard catapult glider from a toy store; the design puts the c.g. well forward, requiring nose-up lift.

Violations of the basic principle are exploited in some high performance "relaxed static stability" combat aircraft to enhance agility; artificial stability is supplied by active electronic means.

There are a few classical cases where this favourable response was not achieved, notably some early T-tail jet aircraft. In the event of a very high angle of attack, the horizontal stabilizer became immersed in downwash from the wing and fuselage, causing excessive download on the stabilizer, increasing the angle of attack still further. The only way an aircraft could recover from this situation was by jettisoning tail ballast or deploying a special tail parachute.  The phenomenon became known as '[[Stall (flight)#Deep stall|deep stall]]'.

Taking moments about the [[center of gravity]], the net nose-up moment is:
:&lt;math&gt;M=L_w x_g-(l_t-x_g)L_t\!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_g\!&lt;/math&gt; is the location of the center of gravity behind the [[aerodynamic center]] of the main wing, &lt;math&gt;l_t\!&lt;/math&gt; is the tail moment arm.
For trim, this moment must be zero.  For a given maximum elevator deflection, there is a corresponding limit on center of gravity position at which the aircraft can be kept in equilibrium.  When limited by control deflection this is known as a 'trim limit'.  In principle trim limits could determine the permissible forwards and rearwards shift of the centre of gravity, but usually it is only the forward cg limit which is determined by the available control, the aft limit is usually dictated by stability.

In a missile context 'trim limit' more usually refers to the maximum angle of attack, and hence lateral acceleration which can be generated.

===Static stability===
The nature of stability may be examined by considering the increment in pitching moment with change in angle of attack at the trim condition.  If this is nose up, the aircraft is longitudinally unstable; if nose down it is stable.  Differentiating the moment equation with respect to &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial M}{\partial \alpha}=x_g\frac{\partial L_w}{\partial \alpha}-(l_t-x_g)\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial \alpha} &lt;/math&gt;
Note: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial M}{\partial \alpha} &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Stability derivatives|stability derivative]].

It is convenient to treat total lift as acting at a distance h ahead of the centre of gravity, so that the moment equation may be written:
:&lt;math&gt;M=h(L_w+L_t)\!&lt;/math&gt;
Applying the increment in angle of attack:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial M}{\partial \alpha}=h\left(\frac{\partial L_w}{\partial \alpha}+\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial \alpha}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
Equating the two expressions for moment increment:
:&lt;math&gt;h=x_g-l_t\frac {\frac {\partial L_t}{\partial \alpha}}{\frac{\partial L_w}{\partial \alpha}+\frac{\partial L_t}{\partial \alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;
The total lift &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of &lt;math&gt;L_w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_t&lt;/math&gt; so the sum in the denominator can be simplified and written as the derivative of the total lift due to angle of attack, yielding:
:&lt;math&gt;h=\frac{x_g}{c}-\left(1-\frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial \alpha}\right)\frac{\frac{\partial C_l}{\partial \alpha}}{\frac{\partial C_L}{\partial \alpha}}\frac{l_t S_t}{c S_w}&lt;/math&gt;
Where c is the [[mean aerodynamic chord]] of the main wing.  The term:
:&lt;math&gt;V_t=\frac{l_t S_t}{c S_w}&lt;/math&gt;
is known as the tail volume ratio.  Its rather complicated coefficient{{clarify|date=December 2014}}&lt;!-- why is it complicated? --&gt;, the ratio of the two lift derivatives, has values in the range of 0.50 to 0.65 for typical configurations, according to Piercy.  Hence the expression for h may be written more compactly, though somewhat approximately, as:
:&lt;math&gt;h=x_g-0.5 cV_t\!&lt;/math&gt;
h is known as the [[static margin]].  For stability it must be negative. (However, for consistency of language, the static margin is sometimes taken as &lt;math&gt;-h&lt;/math&gt;, so that positive stability is associated with positive static margin.)

== Neutral point ==
A mathematical analysis of the longitudinal static stability of a complete aircraft (including horizontal stabilizer) yields the position of center of gravity at which stability is neutral.  This position is called the neutral point.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;  (The larger the area of the horizontal stabilizer, and the greater the moment arm of the horizontal stabilizer about the aerodynamic center, the further aft is the neutral point.)

The static center of gravity margin (c.g. margin) or [[static margin]] is the distance between the center of gravity (or mass) and the neutral point.  It is usually quoted as a percentage of the [[Chord (aircraft)|Mean Aerodynamic Chord]].  The center of gravity must lie ahead of the neutral point for positive stability (positive static margin). If the center of gravity is behind the neutral point, the aircraft is longitudinally unstable (the static margin is negative), and active inputs to the control surfaces are required to maintain stable flight.  Some combat aircraft that are controlled by [[fly-by-wire]] systems are designed to be longitudinally unstable so they will be highly maneuverable.  Ultimately, the position of the center of gravity relative to the neutral point determines the stability, control forces, and controllability of the vehicle.&lt;ref name=LJC16/&gt;

For a [[tailless aircraft]] &lt;math&gt;V_t=0&lt;/math&gt;, the neutral point coincides with the aerodynamic center, and so for longitudinal static stability the center of gravity must lie ahead of the aerodynamic center.

== Longitudinal dynamic stability ==

An aircraft’s static stability is an important, but not sufficient, measure of its handling characteristics, and whether it can be flown with ease and comfort by a human pilot. In particular, the [[longitudinal dynamic stability]] of a statically stable aircraft will determine whether or not it is finally able to return to its original position.

'''Mario Mieli''' (21 May 1952, [[Milan]] – 12 March 1983) was a leading figure in the Italian [[gay]] movement of the 1970s. He combined a radical theoretical perspective with a provocative public persona. His sometimes outrageous public behavior made him a controversial figure, but he was nonetheless respected as one of the movement's most important intellectuals. He’s best known among English speakers for ''Towards a Gay Communism'', a political pamphlet excerpted from his major theoretical work ''Homosexuality and Liberation: Elements of a Gay Critique''.

== Life ==
Mieli was born in [[Milan]] on May 21, 1952 into a large and prosperous family. He lived for the first sixteen years of his life on his family's estate near [[Como]]. He moved back to Milan with his family in 1968. Politically precocious, he threw himself into the student uprising of that year, beginning a long commitment to revolutionary causes.

In 1971 he moved to London as a student, where he took an active part in the London Gay Liberation Front. Though he spent intermittent time in London until 1975, in 1972 based himself in Milan where he studied at university. In April 1972, he, along with [[Massimo Consoli]] (1945–2007), Nicolino Tosoni (b. 1943), Angelo Pezzana (b. 1940) and the French writer [[Françoise d'Eaubonne]] (1920–2005) held the first homosexual demonstration in Italy at a Congress of Sexology in [[Sanremo|San Remo]]. They protested against psychiatric condemnation of homosexual conduct and the use of aversion therapy to "convert" homosexuals.

In 1972, Mieli helped found the collective Fronte Unitario Omosessuale Rivoluzionario Italiano (Italian revolutionary homosexual united front). Better known by its acronym F.U.O.R.I! (Come out!), it was Italy's first major gay-rights group. Started in Turin in 1971, F.U.O.R.I! appeared almost simultaneously in Rome, Padua, Venice and in Milan, where Mieli was an organizer. After the collective united with the Italian Radical Party, Mieli criticized the move as "counter-revolutionary," since he thought the gay movement should remain independent of political parties. He left the organization over political differences in 1974–75.

After 1974 Mieli continued his activism by organizing the Collettivi Omosessuali Milanesi (Homosexual collectives of Milan). In 1976 the group’s gay theatrical group, Nostra Signora dei Fiori, staged his play ''La Traviata Norma. Ovvero: Vaffanculo... ebbene sì!'' (the title’s numerous puns defy translation). This outrageous production was successfully staged in Milan, Florence, and Rome. An in-your-face spectacle, it deliberately presented behavior designed to flout conventional, heterosexual norms.

A controversial personality, Mieli sometimes made a spectacle of himself. Once in Rome he publicly ate his own excrement and that of a dog.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} While some may have found this behavior outrageous or frightening, others knew him as a gentle person who enjoyed [[cross-dressing]], capable of being very charming in private.

By 1976, Mieli had graduated and began revising for publication his doctoral thesis in Moral Philosophy. The revision was published as ''Elementi di critica omosessuale''. An English translation of the book was made by [[David Fernbach]] as ''Homosexuality and Liberation: Elements of a Gay Critique''. The translation’s last chapter – "Towards a Gay Communism"—was excerpted as a political pamphlet and became Mieli’s most widely known work among English speakers.

This major theoretical work is widely considered the most important text from the Italian gay community. With rich humor and a cosmopolitan gay sensibility, Mieli contends that homosexual liberation is an integral and indispensable part of a much wider emancipation. Mieli cites "educastration" at the core of a repressive set of norms intended to stifle the full expression of a natural human [[transsexuality]]. He combines [[Freud]]'s ideas on "polymorphous perversion" (see [[Polymorphous perverse]]) with [[Marxist economics]] to argue that human liberation is possible only through a revolution allowing uninhibited [[pansexuality]].

By 1981, Mieli became increasingly pessimistic about his cause. In 1983, he told friends about a forthcoming book titled ''Il risveglio dei Faraoni'' (''The Awakening of the Pharaohs''). It was to be an autobiographical novel, set in Egypt featuring a resurrected Jesus. However, in early March, he decided to stop publication of the book, writing in a letter to a friend that the book might inspire someone to "have his hide". In another letter dated March 11, he wrote, "My book will not be published by my free choice".

Mario Mieli killed himself the following day, on March 12, 1983. He died at age 30 from asphyxiation by inhaling gas in his Milan apartment.

It seems that Mieli's suicide stemmed from adverse reaction he expected from the book’s publication. Although a pirated edition was later published, his family brought legal action and had all copies destroyed. Only in 1994 was ''Il risveglio dei Faraoni'' published legally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6065">'''Ophiophagy''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὄφις + φαγία}} "snake eating") is a specialized form of [[feeding]] or alimentary [[behavior]] of animals which [[predation|hunt]] and eat [[snake]]s. There are ophiophagous [[mammal]]s (such as the [[skunk]]s and the [[mongoose]]s), [[bird]]s (such as [[Circaetinae|snake eagles]], the [[secretarybird]], and some [[hawk]]s), [[lizard]]s (such as the [[common collared lizard]]), and even other snakes, such as the Central and South American [[mussurana]]s and the North American [[Lampropeltis getula|common kingsnake]]. The genus of the venomous [[king cobra]] (''Ophiophagus hannah'') is named for this habit.

==Ophiophagy in myth and legend==
:''The mythic associations of snakes are discussed at [[Serpent (symbolism)]].''
A snake-eating bird of prey appears in a [[legend]] of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] people, who gave rise to the [[Aztec]] empire, and it is represented in the [[flag of Mexico|Mexican flag]]: The [[Mexica]]s, guided by their god [[Huitzilopochtli]], sought a place where the bird landed on a [[Opuntia|prickly pear cactus]], devouring a snake. They found the sign on an island in [[Lake Texcoco]], where they erected the city of [[Tenochtitlan]] ("Place of the Prickly Pear Cactus" &amp;ndash; present-day [[Mexico City]]) in 1325. (In the [[coat of arms of Mexico]] this bird is depicted as a [[golden eagle]], though it is often said to be a [[northern caracara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siti.com.mx/musave.dir/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907150539/http://www.siti.com.mx/musave.dir/ |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that the bird was a [[laughing falcon]] or snake hawk, a bird of prey which feeds almost exclusively on snakes.) 
[[Image:Coat of arms of Mexico.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of Mexico]]

The [[Maya peoples|Mayans]] also had the legend of ophiophagy in their [[folklore]] and [[mythology]]. 

[[Guatemala]] may derive its name from the [[Nahuatl]] word ''coactlmoctl-lan'', meaning "land of the snake-eating bird."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.questconnect.org/ca_guatemala.htm |title=Guatemala |publisher=Questconnect.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christianity|Christian]] folklore associates snakes with [[evil]] (see [[serpent (symbolism)#Serpents in Judeo-Christian Mythology|serpent]]) and considers anything that destroys them good. An example for this tradition is [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[short story]] "[[Rikki-Tikki-Tavi]]" (in ''[[The Jungle Book]]''), in which Rikki-Tikki, a [[mongoose]], defends a human family against a pair of evil [[cobra]]s.

In [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] scriptures, [[Garuda]], the mount of [[Vishnu]], is the enemy to the [[Naga (mythology)|Nāgas]], a race of intelligent serpent- or dragon-like beings, whom he hunts.

==Practical use==
[[Image:Morphnus_guianensis_eating_green_snake_-Bolivia-8.jpg|thumb|[[Crested eagle]] with [[emerald tree boa]] prey]]

In some regions, farmers keep ophiophagous animals as [[pet]]s in order to keep their living environment clear of such snakes as [[cobra]]s and [[Crotalinae|pit viper]]s (including [[rattlesnake]]s and [[Bothrops|lanceheads]]) which annually claim a large number of deaths of domestic animals, such as [[cattle]], and bites on humans. An example is tamed [[mongoose]]s in [[India]]. In the 1930s a [[Brazil]]ian plan to breed and release large numbers of [[mussurana]]s for the control of pit vipers was tried but didn't work. The [[Instituto Butantan|Butantan Institute]], in [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]], which specializes in the production of [[antivenom]]s, erected a statue of the mussurana ''[[Clelia clelia]]'' as its symbol and a tribute to its usefulness in combating venomous snake bites. Peafowl have been kept for millennia due to their ophiophagous habit.

==Immunity==
Many ophiophagous animals seem to be immune to the [[venom]] of the usual [[venomous snake|snakes]] they prey and feed upon. The phenomenon was studied in the [[mussurana]] by the Brazilian scientist [[Vital Brazil]]. They have [[antihemorrhagic]] and antineurotoxic [[antibody|antibodies]] in their [[blood]]. The [[Virginia opossum]] (''Didelphis virginiana'') has been found to have the most resistance towards snake venom. This immunity is not acquired and has probably evolved as an adaptation to predation by venomous snakes in their [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]].

In [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', the author correctly dismisses the idea of [[mongoose]]s ingesting herbs to combat poison as old folklore. He attributes no special abilities to the animal other than superb agility and skill at avoiding being bitten. However, recent studies have shown that the mongoose's ability to resist snake venom is at least in part due to its modified nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR) that does not bind with [[Alpha-Bungarotoxin|alpha-BTX]], and [[alpha-neurotoxin]] (Barchan et al. 1992).

'''Paul Laffoley''' (August 14, 1935 – November 16, 2015) was an American [[visionary artist]] and [[architect]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], represented by [[Kent Fine Art]] in New York.

==Biography==

Paul Laffoley, as one of America's foremost visionary artists, seemed to work in a perpetual present tense (there is no "late" or "old age" style for him). From a young age, spiritual productivity was measured by how deeply one's wisdom could be developed, and how broadly one's compassion could exert itself.

Paul Laffoley was born on August 14, 1935 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to an [[Irish Catholic]] family.  His father, Paul Laffoley, Sr., the president of the Cambridge Trust Company, was also a [[lawyer]] and taught classes at [[Harvard Business School]]. Although his father had been against him pursuing painting as a career, Laffoley was indoctrinated with his father's religious philosophical beliefs including aspects of Buddhism and Hinduism and what he called "mind-physics". Laffoley senior also instructed Paul that there was "no gravity" which was a source of great humor when Paul was given the assignment to explain in grade school.

Laffoley wrote that his first spoken word was "[[Constantinople]]" at the age of six months. He did not speak again until he was four years old.&lt;ref name="madone"/&gt; He was diagnosed as having Asperger's Syndrome testing both high and low academically.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} According to Laffoley, he attended the progressive Mary Lee Burbank School in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]], where his draftsman's talent was ridiculed by his [[abstract expressionist]] teachers.  After further studies at the Waldorf School, Laffoley would complete undergraduate studies at [[Brown University]], graduating in 1961 with honors in classics, philosophy, and [[art history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Laffoley Bio|url=http://kentfineart.net/artists/paul-laffoley|publisher=Kent Fine Arts LLC|accessdate=12 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021031335/http://kentfineart.net/artists/paul-laffoley/|archivedate=21 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As written by Paul in The Phenomenology of Revelation, he was given eight [[electroshock]] treatments after the termination of "about a year of weekly sessions with a psychiatrist, who had treated me for a mild state of catatonia" while at Brown in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lafolley|first=Paul|title="The Dream As The Initiation" from The Phenomenology of Revelation|year=1989|publisher=Kent Fine Arts|location=New York, NY|isbn=1878607057|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, he enrolled at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he studied architecture because it consisted of diagrams that rendered objects in space with accuracy and precision.  He also studied with the sculptor Mirko Basaldella at Harvard's Carpenter Center that he cited was an early influence. After one year, he was summarily grand juried out of the GSD by the faculty for being "overly involved in his work". By chance, Laffoley was given an issue of Progressive Architecture by his uncle with Frederick Kiesler on the cover.  Laffoley felt Kiesler work was what he had been searching for, and after writing 17 letters, Laffoley came to New York and succeeded in apprenticing with [[Frederick John Kiesler|Frederick Kiesler]].  While canvasing the art scene in New York, Laffoley would meet [[Andy Warhol]], who offered him a place to sleep at his 87th Street fire station if he would report on late night television between 1 and 5 am. It was from watching these Indian Head Test Patterns along with his early exposure to a Hindu tutor that Laffoley would arrive at a format for his large scale paintings that would dominate his work for five decades.

After the death of his father in 1963, Paul would return to Boston from New York, and eventually established his first dedicated studio space at 36 Bromfield Street on Christmas Day, 1968.  It was there that Paul's career would begin to "connect" with an early show at the Orson Welles Theater that was "highjacked" and taken to the Woodstock Music Festival for presentation by Dean Gitter without Paul's permission.  In an effort to recover his work, Paul took the bus to Woodstock which lead to his exposure to the current countercultures of the day, and would be followed by numerous exhibition opportunities and curatorial projects that would lead to the creation of his Boston Visionary Cell (1971).  The Boston Visionary Cell, which Paul Laffoley founded on the model of an artists’ guild, was a highly communal and curatorial undertaking.  The charter of the Boston Visionary Cell underscores Laffoley’s thought processes “to develop and advance visionary art”.

By the late 1980s, Laffoley began to move from the spiritual and the intellectual, and evolved to the view of his work as an interactive, physically engaging [[psychotronics|psychotronic]] device, perhaps similar to architectural monuments such as [[Stonehenge]] or the Cathedral of Notre Dame and their spiritual aura.  Works such as Thanaton III (1989), The Orgone Motor (1983), and the Geochronmechane: The Time Machine from Earth (1990) would follow this concept.

After the destruction of the World Trade Center towers on [[September 11, 2001]], Laffoley was one of a number of architects who, in 2002, submitted designs for the competition to plan the [[One World Trade Center|Freedom Tower]]. Laffoley took his inspiration from the work of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] architect [[Antoni Gaudí]]. His conception was to plan a gigantic hotel in the style of Gaudí's [[Sagrada Família]] church in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Glenn|title=Postmodern, In a Manner Of Speaking; A Shape Out of 1908 Is Offered Downtown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/21/nyregion/postmodern-in-a-manner-of-speaking-a-shape-out-of-1908-is-offered-downtown.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="madone"&gt;{{cite web|last=Larroque|first=Jean-Pierre|title=The Mad One|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmBuzdLUFsc|publisher=Doublethink Productions|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Austin Museum of Art organized a traveling survey of his career in 1999, Mr. Laffoley became something of a cult figure for curators around the world. The Palais de Tokyo in Paris devoted an entire room to his work in its 2009 exhibition "Chasing Napoleon", and several of his works were included in "The Alternative Guide to the Universe" at the Hayward Gallery in London in 2013. Other major shows include Premonitions of the Bauharoque at the Henry Art Gallery, Seattle (publication), Secret Garden at the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin (publication) and the recent monograph entitled ''The Essential Paul Laffoley'' edited by Douglas Walla and published by the University of Chicago Press in Spring 2016.

==About==
Following his formal education in the classics at Brown and architectural studies at [[Harvard]], Laffoley would begin to assimilate and systematically cross-pollinate his related strands of intellectual inquiry.  In a search for expanded opportunities, he went to New York in 1963 to work with the visionary artist and architect [[Frederick Kiesler]], and was also recruited to view late-night TV for [[Andy Warhol]] in exchange for a place to sleep.  Weekdays, Laffoley found employment with [[Emery Roth &amp; Sons]] where he worked on the plans for the yet to be built [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] Towers before being terminated upon his suggestion of bridges joining the two buildings.

At that time, Laffoley had been painting in the basement of his family home in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] on the weekends, completing his first fully mature vision:  The [[Kali-Yuga]]: The End of the Universe at 424826 A.D.  From this point forward, Laffoley began to formulate his unique trans-disciplinary approach to a new discipline combining, [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[architecture]] and spirituality to the practice of painting.  Laffoley first began to organize his ideas in a format related to eastern [[mandalas]], partially inspired by the late night patterns he watched for Warhol on late night television.  This quickly developed into four general subcategories of paintings: [[operating system]]s, [[Psychotronics|psychotronic]] devices, meta-energy, [[time travel]], and [[lucid dream]]ing.  Conceived of as "structured singularities", Laffoley never works in series, but rather approaches each project as a unique schematic.  Working in a solitary lifestyle, each 73 ½ x 73 ½ inch canvas would take up to three years to paint and code.  By the late 1980s, Laffoley began to move from the spiritual and the intellectual, to the view of his work as an interactive, physically engaging psychotronic device, a modern approach to trans-disciplinary enlightenment and its spiritual aura.

From an early age, Laffoley manifested an obsessive interest in [[UFO]]s.  He had seen the movie ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' 873 times.  He explains that his obsessive interest in the film derives partly from a fascination with the architecture of the space ship in the film which, early on in his life, was subconscious. While he was still a child he made a vow to become an architect so that he could design flying saucers, although he did not become a registered architect until he was 50 years of age.

{{quote|Two years later, in preparation for a major oral surgery, I was subjected to a routine cat-scan of my head.  As a result, a miniature metallic-like "implant" was discovered in my brain near the pineal gland.  A local chapter of [[MUFON]] (Mutual UFO Network) declared it to be a "nanotechnological laboratory" capable of accelerating or retarding my brain activity.  I have come to believe that the implant is extraterrestrial in origin and is the main motivation of my ideas and theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laffoley|first=Paul|title="Disco Volante" from the UFO Show|year=2000|publisher=University Galleries, Illinois State University|location=Normal, IL|isbn=0-945558-30-9|pages=34, 36, 24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Work==

Painted on large canvases, the majority of Paul Laffoley's paintings combine words and imagery to depict a spiritual architecture of explanation, tackling concepts like dimensionality, time travel through hacking relativity, connecting conceptual threads shared by philosophers through the millennia, and theories about the cosmic origins of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outsider Art Sourcebook|date=March 2009|publisher=Raw Vision|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0954339326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ken|title=The Boston Visionary Cell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/arts/design/paul-laffoley-the-boston-visionary-cell.html?_r=0|accessdate=12 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ken|title=ART IN REVIEW: Paul Laffoley, 'Portaling'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/06/arts/art-in-review-paul-laffoley-portaling.html|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010,

Laffoley's writings as well as works of art were published in May 2016 by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in a new book entitled ''The Essential Paul Laffoley'' edited and texts by Douglas Walla, with further texts by [[Linda Dalywimple Henderson]], [[Arielle Saiber]] and [[Steven Moskowitz]].

British writer [[Michael Bracewell]], in his collection of essays entitled ''When Surface was Depth'' observed: "If Laffoley's work within the Boston Visionary Cell can be said to have one principal preoccupation - a common denominator of his eclectic scholarship and practice - then that preoccupation would be to understand the process by which one goes from becoming to being." Bracewell has also written that, "The Boston Visionary Cell, as a concretized manifestation of its inhabitant's work and preoccupations, describes the way in which a chaos of data - no less than a chaos of marble - can be sculpted by research to release the perfect forms within it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|title=when surface was depth|date=July 9, 2002|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=London|isbn=0306811308|pages=346–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Estate of Paul Laffoley is represented by [[Kent Fine Art]] in New York.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14043">'''Protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score''' ('''PDCAAS''') is a method of evaluating the [[protein quality|quality of a protein]] based on both the [[amino acid]] requirements of humans and their ability to digest it.

The PDCAAS rating was adopted by the [[US FDA]] and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations/[[World Health Organization]] (FAO/WHO) in 1993 as "the preferred 'best'" method to determine [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] quality.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U5900t/u5900t07.htm Boutrif, E., Food Quality and Consumer Protection Group, Food Policy and Nutrition Division, FAO, Rome: "Recent Developments in Protein Quality Evaluation" ''Food, Nutrition and Agriculture'', Issue 2/3, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 FAO proposed changing to [[Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score]].

==Methodology==
Using the PDCAAS method, the protein quality rankings are determined by comparing the amino acid profile of the specific food protein against a standard amino acid profile with the highest possible score being a 1.0. This score means, after [[digestion]] of the protein, it provides per unit of protein 100% or more of the [[Essential amino acid|indispensable amino acids]] required.

The formula for calculating the PDCAAS percentage is: (mg of [[limiting amino acid]] in 1 g of test protein / mg of same amino acid in 1 g of reference protein) x fecal true digestibility percentage.&lt;ref name=pmid10867064/&gt;

The PDCAAS value is different from measuring the quality of protein from the [[Protein efficiency ratio|protein efficiency ratio (PER)]] and the [[biological value]] (BV) methods.&lt;ref name="Best"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Jay R.|last2=Falvo|first2=Michael J.|year=2004|title=Protein – Which is Best|url=http://www.jssm.org/vol3/n3/2/v3n3-2pdf.pdf|journal=Journal of Sports Science and Medicine|volume=3|issue=3|pages=118–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PER was based upon the amino acid requirements of growing rats, which noticeably differ from those of humans. The PDCAAS allows evaluation of food protein quality based on the needs of humans as it measures the quality of a protein based on the amino acid requirements (adjusted for digestibility) of a 2- to 5-year-old child (considered the most nutritionally demanding age group). The BV method uses nitrogen absorption as a basis. However, it does not take into account certain factors influencing the digestion of the protein and is of limited use for application to human protein requirements because what is measured is maximal potential of quality and not a true estimate of quality at requirement level. Nevertheless, BV can be used to assess requirements of protein derived from foods with known quality differences and measure the proportion of absorbed nitrogen which is retained and presumably used for protein synthesis as an accurate indicator for protein measurement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/M2835E/M2835E00.HTM Srikantia, S. G., University of Mysore, Mysore:  "The Use Of Biological Value Of A Protein In Evaluating Its Quality For Human Requirements", ''Joint FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation on Energy and Protein Requirements EPR 81 29'', Rome, Aug 1981.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA gave two reasons for adopting the PDCAAS in 1993: 1) PDCAAS is based on human amino acid requirements, which makes it more appropriate for humans than a method based on the amino acid needs of animals. 2) The Food and Agricultural Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) had previously recommended PDCAAS for regulatory purposes.

==Limitations==
===Digestion===
Amino acids that move beyond the terminal [[ileum]] in the body are less likely to be absorbed for use in [[protein synthesis]]. They may pass out of the body, or may be absorbed by [[bacteria]], thus will not be present in the feces, and will appear to have been digested. The PDCAAS takes no account of where the proteins have been digested.

Similarly, amino acids that are lost due to [[antinutritional factor]]s present in many foods are assumed to be digested according to the PDCAAS.

Due to this in 2013 the FAO proposed changing to [[Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ift.org/food-technology/daily-news/2013/march/07/fao-proposes-new-protein-quality-measurement.aspx FAO proposes new protein quality measurement. March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Focus on single proteins===
The PDCAAS method may also still be considered incomplete, since human diets, except in times of [[famine]], almost never contain only one kind of [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]. However, calculating the PDCAAS of a diet solely based on the PDCAAS of the individual constituents is impossible, because one food may provide an abundance of an amino acid that the other is missing, in which case the PDCAAS of the diet is higher than that of any one of the constituents. To arrive at the final result, all individual amino acids would have to be taken into account, though, so the PDCAAS of each constituent is largely useless.

For example, grain protein has a PDCAAS of about 0.4 to 0.5, limited by [[lysine]]. On the other hand, it contains more than enough [[methionine]]. [[Bean|White bean]] protein (and that of many other [[pulses]]) has a PDCAAS of 0.6 to 0.7, limited by methionine, and contains more than enough lysine. When both are eaten in roughly equal quantities in a diet, the PDCAAS of the [[protein combining|combined constituent]] is 1.0, because each constituent's protein is complemented by the other.

A more extreme example would be the combination of [[gelatine]] (which contains virtually no [[tryptophan]] and thus has a PDCAAS of 0) with isolated tryptophan (which, lacking all other essential amino acids, also has a PDCAAS of 0). Despite individual scores of 0, the combination of both in adequate amounts has a positive PDCAAS, with the limiting amino acids [[isoleucine]], [[threonine]], and [[methionine]]. Further, according to a 2000 study by Gerjan Schaafsma, "The questions about the validity of the amino acid scoring pattern and the application of the true fecal rather than the true ileal&lt;!-- not an error, adj of ileum --&gt; digestibility correction, as well as the truncation of PDCAAS values warrant a critical evaluation of PDCAAS in its current form as a measure of protein quality in human diets."&lt;ref name=pmid10867064/&gt; Also, the scientific community has raised critical questions about the validity of PDCAAS (the validity of the preschool-age child amino acid scoring pattern, the validity of the true fecal digestibility correction and the truncation of PDCAAS values to 100%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1998|title=Impact of amino acid availability on the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score|journal=Bulletin|publisher=International Dairy Federation|volume=336|pages=46–50|issn=0259-8434|vauthors=Darragh AJ, Schaafsma G, Moughan PJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Dairy Foundation on Nutrition and Health Proceedings of the International Workshop on Nutritional Aspects of Milk Proteins in Comparison with Other Proteins, organized by the Dutch Foundation on Nutrition and Health, Utrecht, the Netherlands, March 13–14, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capped score===
In addition, the fact that four proteins, all with different amino acid profiles, receive identical scores of 1.0 limits its usefulness as a comparative tool. Since they have different compositions, it is natural to assume that they perform differently in the human body and should have different scores. In short, this method, however, gives no distinction of their performance relative to each other, because after they pass a certain point, they are all capped at 1.0 and receive an identical rating.&lt;ref name="Best" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sarwar G|date=May 1997|title=The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method overestimates quality of proteins containing antinutritional factors and of poorly digestible proteins supplemented with limiting amino acids in rats|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9164998|journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=127|issue=5|pages=758–64 |pmid=9164998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schaafsma G|year=2005 |title=The Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS)--a concept for describing protein quality in foods and food ingredients: a critical review|journal=Journal of AOAC International |volume=88|issue=3|pages=988–94|pmid=16001875}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because in 1990 at a FAO/WHO meeting, it was decided that proteins having values higher than 1.0 would be rounded or "leveled down" to 1.0 as scores above 1.0 are considered to indicate the protein contains essential amino acids in excess of the human requirements.&lt;ref name="FAOWHO1990"&gt;FAO/WHO [1990].

This reference pattern is based on the essential amino acid requirements for preschool children aged 1-3 years as published in [https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12 Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (2005)]. Adults aged 18+ will have [https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12#687 slightly lower requirements].

A '''pugil stick''' is a heavily padded pole-like training weapon used since the early 1940s by [[military]] personnel in training for [[rifle]] and [[bayonet]] combat.&lt;ref name="Marine pugil"&gt;[http://www.marines.com/main/index/making_marines/recruit_training/training_matrix/pugil_stick "Pugil Stick-Overcoming Hesitation and the Opponent"], www.marines.com, Retrieved 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The pugil stick is similar to a [[quarterstaff]] or [[bo (weapon)|Japanese ''bo'']], and may be marked to indicate which end represents the bayonet and which the [[rifle]] butt. Dr. Armond H. Seidler (1919-2017) of the [[University of New Mexico]] invented the Pugil Stick training method during [[World War II]]. It was initially adopted by the [[United States Marine Corps]], but was later included in [[United States Army]] combat training as well. Dr. Seidler received an award from the Marine Corps for his invention. 

Pugil bouts are usually conducted with hard contact while wearing protective gear such as groin protectors, [[American football]] helmets, [[hockey]] gloves, and chest protectors or shin guards, such as those worn by [[baseball]] [[catcher]]s. Some pugil sticks are made with integrated hand guards to reduce the potential for injury. Military procedures for pugil bouts are often detailed, with [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] both prohibiting pugil training by anyone who has recently suffered [[concussion of the brain]], lest they suffer [[traumatic brain injury]], or had a tooth extraction within the past 24 hours.

Pugil stick sparring was popularized in the United States by the ''[[American Gladiators]]'', a physical [[game show]] which ran from 1989 to 1996, and again in the [[American Gladiators (2008 TV series)|2008 revival]], as well as in [[Gladiators (1992 UK TV series)|the British version]]. In the "Joust" contest, competitors would try to knock each other off pedestals using pugil sticks.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

The name "pugil stick" is a [[neologism]] from the [[Latin]] noun ''pugnus'' (fist), the source for other English words such as "pugilist" (boxer) and "pugnacious" (eager to fight).

'''''Pure Theory of Law''''' ({{lang-de|Reine Rechtslehre}}) is a book by legal theorist [[Hans Kelsen]], first published in 1934 and in a greatly expanded "second edition" (effectively a new book) in 1960. The second edition appeared in English translation in 1967, as ''Pure Theory of Law'',&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley, U. California P., 1967. The title page has correctly ''Pure Theory of Law'', but the paperback cover has wrongly ''The&lt;!-- [sic] --&gt; Pure Theory of Law''. This has been corrected, for the paperback cover as well as the hardback dustjacket, in a reprint by another publisher "by arrangement with" the Hans Kelsen-Institut: Clark, NJ; The LawbookExchange&lt;!-- the non-spacing is correct --&gt;; 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-58477-578-2}} (p), {{ISBN|978-1-58477-206-4}} (h).&lt;/ref&gt; the first edition in English translation in 1992, as ''Introduction to the Problems of Legal Theory''. The theory proposed in this book has probably been the most influential theory of law produced during the 20th century. It is, at the least, one of the high points of modernist legal theory.&lt;ref&gt;Both editions will be included in forthcoming volumes in the [http://www.mohr.de/en/law/text-editions/buch/hans-kelsen-werke.html/ Hans Kelsen Werke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185519/http://www.mohr.de/en/law/text-editions/buch/hans-kelsen-werke.html/ |date=2013-10-29 }}. A fuller and more accurate translation of the second edition is also planned. The current translation, in omitting many footnotes, obscures the extent to which the Pure Theory of Law is both philosophically grounded and responsive to earlier theories of law.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
The two editions of Kelsen's book were separated by twenty-six years, and the second edition (1960) was almost twice the length of the first in the detail of its presentation. The original terminology which was introduced in the first edition was already present in many of Kelsen's writings from the 1920s, and were also subject to discussion in the critical press of that decade as well, before it was first published in 1934. Although the second edition was significantly longer, the two editions had a great deal of similarity of content, and much of the material covered in the volumes is consistent not only with one another, but also with many of Kelsen's previous writings from the 1910s and 1920s. The following sections herein shall follow Kelsen's own preference for the presentation of his main topics of the pure theory of law as he presented them in the second edition of this book.

==Chapters==
===I. Law and Nature===
In the first paragraph of ''Pure Theory of Law'', Kelsen introduces his theory as being a theory of positive law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=1–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of positive law is then presented by Kelsen as forming a hierarchy of laws which start from a [[basic norm]] (''Grundnorm'') where all other norms are related to each other by either being inferior norms, when the one is compared to the other, or superior norms. The interaction of these norms is then further subject to representation as a static theory of law (Kelsen's chapter 4) or as a dynamic theory of law (Kelsen's chapter 5).

===II. Law and Morals===
Kelsen's strict separation of law and morality, in Chapter Two of ''Pure Theory of Law'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=59–69}}; Kelsen's ''Recht und Moral'' is more accurately translated as "Law and Morality".&lt;/ref&gt; was an integral part of his presentation of the Pure Theory of Law. The application of the law, in order to be protected from moral influence or political influence, needed to be safeguarded by its separation from the sphere of conventional moral influence or political influence. Kelsen did not deny that moral discussion was still possible and even to be encouraged in the sociological domain of intersubjective activity. However, the Pure Theory of Law was not to be subject to such influences.

===III. Law and Science===
In Chapter Three of ''Pure Theory of Law'', law is defined as the application of norms to its functions within the delineations of a science of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=70−107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science was generally the domain of the causal understanding of epistemological data and its primary logical and causally oriented technique was to be distinguished from the normative reasoning as was to be found in the Pure Theory of Law. Therefore, the legal sciences were to be normatively based in distinction from the physical sciences which were to be causally based.

===IV. The Static Aspect of Law===
In Chapter Four, Kelsen distinguishes the static theory of law from the dynamic theory of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=108-192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The static theory of law represents the law as a hierarchy of laws where the individual laws are related as being either superior or inferior the one to the other. This hierarchical theory was largely adopted from Adolf Merkl's research in the structural aspects of the law while Kelsen was still in Vienna. At nearly one hundred pages each, Kelsen's chapters on the static aspect of law and the dynamic aspect of law are the most extensively developed sections of this book.

===V. The Dynamic Aspect of Law===
In Chapter Five of ''Pure Theory of Law'', sections 34 and 35, Kelsen discusses the dynamic theory of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=193–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the dynamic theory of law, the static theory of law comes into direct contact with the governmental administration of the state which must recognize the function of the legislature in the writing of new law. At the same time there is also the understanding of law as being affected by the accumulated standing law which represents the decisions of the courts which in principle become part of the hierarchical representation of the Pure Theory of Law. Importantly, Kelsen allows for the legislative process to recognize the law as the product of political and ethical debate which is the product of the activity of the legislature before it becomes part of the domain of the static theory of law. At nearly one hundred pages in length, this chapter on the dynamic aspect of law is the longest and most fully developed chapter in this book other than the chapter on the static aspect of law.

===VI. Law and State===
Chapter Six of ''Pure Theory of Law'' has Kelsen present his celebrated identity theory of law and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=279–319}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is Kelsen's highly functional theory of the state and the law as representing the same entity. It is not to be confused with the sociological domain or the cultural domain of intersubjective activity. Nor is it to be confused with the political or even the religious domain of intersubjective interaction among individuals.

===VII. State and International Law===
In Chapter Seven, Kelsen discusses the interaction of state law and international law as these are especially guided by the understanding of political sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=320–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Kelsen, the assessment of international law is that it represents a very primitive form of law in distinct contrast to the highly developed forms of law as may be found in individual nations and states. As a result, Kelsen emphasizes that international law is often prone to the conduct of war and severe diplomatic measures (blockade, seizure, internment, etc.) as offering the only corrective measures available to it in regulating the conduct between nations. For Kelsen, this is largely inevitable due to the relative primitiveness of international law in contemporary society.

===VIII. Interpretation===
Kelsen's final chapter, Chapter Eight, deals with the subject of interpretation in at least three of its most important aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|pp=348-355}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, Kelsen discusses the nature and methodology of the interpretation of the law. Second, he discusses interpretation as an act of cognition and of voluntary will. Third, he discusses interpretation as it is to be understood as part of the science of law, as Kelsen has defined it as being 'purified' from the undue influences of politics, morals, and metaphysics.

==Supportive and supplementary commentary==
Kelsen attempted to reconstruct 'legal science (''Rechtswissenschaft'')' as a 'science of norms (''Normen'')', on analogy with [[Immanuel Kant]]'s conception of a science of 'causality' as used in natural science (Hans Kelsen, ''Society and Nature'', 1946, pages 249-262, Kegan Paul Press). This type of legal science would be 'pure' in two senses as described below.

===Defining 'purity' of legal science===
Firstly, it would be 'pure' in a sense analogous to that in Kant's ''[[Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science]]''. It would set out ''a priori'' a 'pure part' of legal science, consisting of a framework of fundamental concepts. Then, in an empirical part of legal science, this framework would be applied to empirical (sociological, historical and so on) material so as to understand that material as 'law'.&lt;ref&gt;To suppose, as is still sometimes done, that Kelsen's title ''Reine Rechtslehre'' should be translated into English not as 'Pure Theory of Law' but as 'Theory of Pure Law' is therefore wrong, conceptually as well as grammatically. Grammatically, ''Reine Rechtslehre'' translates exactly as 'Pure Theory of Law'—'Theory of Pure Law' would have been ''Lehre des reinen Rechts''. This theory of law is a pure theory; it is not a theory of pure law.&lt;/ref&gt;

The science, in both of its parts, would also be 'pure' in a second sense, in being solely descriptive—excluding from the science any element of evaluation. The core subject matter of legal science, for Kelsen, is legal norms. He defines a 'norm' as 'the meaning of an act of will'. Thus, for Kelsen a norm does not necessarily have any element of generality—hence not all norms are rules. Indeed, as the meaning of an act of will, a norm is not intrinsically rational; departing from Kant both back toward [[David Hume]] as well as in the direction of contemporary philosophical [[positivism]], Kelsen denies the existence of [[practical reason]].

Legal science, as Kelsen would like it to be, has to describe a legal norm without either evaluating it or adopting it as an evaluation. This can be done by distinguishing rigorously between the social statement that is the norm itself and the legal-scientific restatement of it that is, or is contained in, a description of the norm. Kelsen terms the norm itself a 'legal norm (''Rechtsnorm'')' and its descriptive restatement a 'legal proposition (''Rechtssatz'')'.&lt;ref&gt;Translators into English have not always served Kelsen well on this. One translation renders ''Rechtssatz'' as 'rule of law in a descriptive sense'. Yet one can have sympathy for the translators; though Kelsen's reasoning is rigorous, his style cannot be described as limpid.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when a jurist (legal scientist) states that the law of a certain country contains the norm 'theft is to be punished with imprisonment', this legal proposition is not a comment on whether anybody in that country has a moral or other extra-legal obligation to impose, accept or evade such a penalty. In reading Kelsen, however, one has to bear in mind that, when he refers to a 'norm', he is usually speaking elliptically: he is uttering a legal proposition which stands for a legal norm, in much the same way that a picture of a dog shows the dog but does not bark.

This kind of 'purity' already excludes ideas of [[natural law]], in which description and evaluation are intimately connected. That leaves as the subject matter of legal science only [[positive law]]. Kelsen is a '[[legal positivist]]' both in that he excludes evaluation from legal science, through a strict separation of 'is' and 'ought', and in that he considers only positive law to be law. Although he never made much sense of the idea of 'custom', he included all public international law as 'law'.

At the same time, although it is not easy to reconcile with his rejection of practical reason, Kelsen was emphatic that politicians should support and make use of legal science. And legal scientists should assist them, for instance in law reform. Although if, when doing so, they go beyond the role of mere technician and recommend policy-based choices between possible norms, they will no longer be acting as legal scientists. For Kelsen, 'is' and 'ought' occupy separate worlds as a matter of logic, but not in practice. Their logical separation should be incorporated into practice.

Kelsen insisted that, if social scientists wished to deal with law, they would have to take their concept of law from legal science—that is, from the Pure Theory of Law. Kelsen made this point particularly against [[Max Weber]], whose philosophical orientation and legal background were similar to his own. And, indeed, although Weber had said much about what is socially called 'law', he had not developed a clear concept of it himself.

===Legal orders===
For Kelsen as for other central European contemporaries, norms occur not singly but in sets, termed 'orders'. The ordering principle of an order of moral norms—and of an order of natural law, if one could exist—would be logical, as deduction. From the general norm 'do not kill other human beings', it follows deductively that A must not kill any other human being. Kelsen calls this a 'static' order. An order of positive law, he maintains, is not, or not centrally, like that. Although it forms a hierarchy, it is 'dynamic', in that its ordering principle is authorisation. Each relatively 'higher' norm authorises someone (an individual or an organ, primarily of the state) to create further and relatively 'lower' norms. In this is found the specific characteristic of positive law, hence of all law, that it regulates its own creation. Even though positive legal norms do commonly contain elements of generality, those elements are not central to the relation between a higher and a lower norm. This is a relation of legal 'validity' (not to be confused with logical validity), which is that the creation of the lower norm has been authorised by the higher norm. Since this moment of creation always involves extraneous considerations, Kelsen does not need to supplement his model with a concept of 'discretion'.

What has to be consistent in a dynamic order of norms is only the process of authorising. This process can (and perhaps always does) result in multiple and mutually uneven strands of hierarchy, such as legislative, executive and judicial strands.&lt;ref&gt;The hierarchy does not have to be, and probably will not be, even-sided, like a pyramid—although that image has been used by one of Kelsen's French translators. ''Reine Rechtslehre'', 2nd ed sec. 35, refers to ''Stufenbau'', which the French translation renders as ''pyramide'' while the English translation has 'hierarchical structure'. 'Steps and stairs' has also been suggested, but it might be best not to attempt an image.&lt;/ref&gt; In each strand, at every point in the process of norm-creation, many types of extra-legal factor may be taken into account—moral, political, economic and others. Kelsen notes that, in this respect, the Pure Theory of Law has an affinity with American '[[legal realism]]'.

At the same time, the 'hierarchy' model does not readily fit a common-law system. It takes as its paradigm a single constitutional document under which codes and statutes are enacted, with both administration and adjudication in subordinate places. However, at least outside the United States, common-law systems are moving in the direction of that paradigm. The 'hierarchy' model also fits public law more readily than private law. It is difficult to be convinced by Kelsen's contention that, in private transactions, the parties are exercising legal authorisation.

===Basic norm (''Grundnorm'')===
Kelsen assumes, however, that the scientific representation of a positive-legal order, as a hierarchy of legal propositions, must have a guarantor of unity. This guarantor cannot be other than a component of the representation, hence a legal proposition. Being a legal proposition, it counts as a representation of an actual norm. So Kelsen calls it, elliptically, a '[[basic norm]] (''Grundnorm'')'.&lt;ref&gt;It is a 'basis (''Grund'')' in a logical sense. Once again, it might be best not to attempt an image.&lt;/ref&gt; A basic norm is 'presupposed' in legal science for each order of positive law, to make it possible to understand that material as an order of positive law. This norm is simply that 'the historically first constitution is to be obeyed'. That constitution may have become established by custom or by revolution: the jurist does not evaluate the circumstances.

Kelsen was always aware that a 'constitution' (''Verfassung'') might or might not be a single document. In some legal orders, indeed, it can be difficult to draw a line between 'constitutional' and other norms. In 1964, Kelsen relativised the idea of 'constitution', holding that each relatively higher legal norm is a 'constitution' in relation to any norm created under its authority. This need not, however, wholly supersede a narrower sense of 'constitution', which identifies those relatively 'high' legal norms that can be changed only through a specially onerous process such as a large parliamentary majority or a popular referendum.

To presuppose a basic norm for a particular positive-legal order does not involve any moral or other extra-legal evaluation of the basic norm's requirement of obedience. The jurist simply supposes that such a requirement has been stated. The jurist does so, irrespective of whether any such norm can be empirically discovered. At this point, serious difficulties emerge—with which Kelsen wrestled for much of his long life.

One part of the problem lay in his starting point, the question 'Why should the law be obeyed?'. He gives the idea of a basic norm two roles. In one role, it is the guarantor of unity in legal-scientific representation of a positive-legal order. In another role, it is an answer, for that legal order, to the obedience question—put in the more clearly descriptive form, 'Why is the law binding?'. One might think, rather, that to suppose for a particular positive-legal order simply that the historically first constitution (identified on this occasion) 'is to be obeyed' is instead to assume that a reason for obedience has already been established outside the legal order and beyond the ken of legal science. In that case, legal science would be seriously inadequate. On the other hand, if the reason for the bindingness of a legal norm is intrinsic to its 'legal' character, that reason might have to be sought in the 'legal' form of the individual norm and not in any kind of further guarantee.

Another part of the problem lay in the requirement that the 'basic' factor be, or count as, a norm. Early on, Kelsen may have supposed that there could be such a real norm. Later, however, the 'basic norm' was relegated to being only a 'hypothesis'. In a philosophical light, nonetheless, it had the status—in Kantian terms—of a 'transcendental-logical presupposition', a logical condition for the possibility of a certain kind of knowledge.

Eventually, Kelsen accepted the criticism that the concept of a basic norm involves an infinite regress. If the basic norm of a particular positive-legal order is an authorising norm, one can ask what is the source of the authority of the basic norm itself. If 'is' and 'ought' are to remain entirely separated, that can only be a still more 'basic' norm; and then the same question could be asked again, and so on infinitely. At this point, Kelsen took a further step back, accepting that the concept of a basic norm is doubly contradictory: it is self-contradictory in that it involves an infinite regress; in addition, since no such norm actually exists, to presuppose the existence of such a norm contradicts reality. The concept is a full 'fiction' in the sense to be found in [[Hans Vaihinger]]'s 'philosophy of "as if"'. But then not much remains of it, although Kelsen evidently considered that what remained was vital.
 
And there Kelsen ended, committed to an epistemology that was so radically relativistic as to challenge the very idea of authorisation. Nonetheless, if Kelsen does not provide an effective answer to the obedience question, he has posed that question—and many others—with exceptional sophistication.

===Metaphysics and persons===
Ideas of natural law are also excluded by Kelsen's rejection of 'metaphysics' in a strong sense, supposing something supra-human. He similarly rejects duplication in ideas of 'the state' as a supra-human entity—rather than a mere, fictional personification of the national legal order. His main target, in the 1930s, was fascist theories of state and law, such as that of [[Carl Schmitt]]. But, for Kelsen, it is also an illusion to think that, in a ''Rechtsstaat'' (roughly, 'rule of law state'), 'the state' is wholly subject to law: from a 'legal point of view', the state and the positive-legal order are the same. It is likewise an illusion to think of a 'legal person', whether relating in fact to a number of real people or to a single real individual, as anything other than a fictional personification of a bundle of norms that are rights and duties pertaining to such people. This is simply so, however, only in the 'pure part' of legal science. Kelsen is perfectly well aware that, in the empirical part, 'the state' will turn out to be a heavily armed real apparatus. One can make a similar extrapolation for the reality of legal persons, where corporate legal persons would turn out to be organisations and individual legal persons to have gender, class, ethnicity and so on.

===Law and power===
Descriptively, the Pure Theory of Law has always been about power. A positive-legal order can be identified when there are norms that regulate their own creation through a process of authorisation and, in addition, the order itself is 'by and large effective'. Kelsen does not closely specify 'by and large', but he does attribute effectiveness to coercion. In this respect, there is some affinity with [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]'s 'command' theory of law. But Kelsen's approach is quite different from Austin's. Austin finds the defining characteristic of law on the plane of the signifier, in imperative utterances. Kelsen has almost no interest in the signifier but focuses on the signified: a 'norm' is an utterance that, whatever its grammatical form, has the meaning 'ought (''Sollen'')'.

Austin and Kelsen also differ in that, for Kelsen, legal norms are addressed primarily to officials. Officials are directed to apply sanctions to individuals when the individuals' behaviour does not conform to a pattern specified in the norm. It is anticipated that individuals, in choosing how they will behave, will take into account the possibility that an official will apply the sanction. In that way, norms and the orders to which they belong can be effective. However, most if not all jurists now accept [[H. L. A. Hart]]'s point in ''[[The Concept of Law]]'', though directed principally against Austin, that not all legal norms are coercive—some, and some of the most important, are facilitative. The Pure Theory of Law can accommodate this by accepting that what matters most is not whether particular legal norms are coercive but whether, by containing coercive norms, the legal order as a whole is coercive—which Hart does not deny.

===International and national law===
Identification of law as characteristically coercive is more difficult with public international law, but Kelsen finds sufficient sanctions.

As to the relation between public international law and national law, however, his position changed dramatically. In the first edition of ''Reine Rechtslehre'', 1934, like many liberal contemporaries he was an internationalist monist: he looked to public international law as global law, subsuming all national or state legal orders. This had the happy consequence that, in its contemporary application, the universality of the Pure Theory (and Kelsen insisted that only universal truths could be 'scientific') would coincide with that of predominantly global law.

By the end of World War II, however, he gave up on this aspiration as unrealistic and, with evident reluctance, accepted a sort of optional monism. He found equally tenable the view that the public international legal order is supremely valid and the view that each national or state legal order is—for itself, in a kind of 'solipsism'—supremely valid. The story of the 'basic norm' might be read as a battle to come to terms with the 'solipsist' option. Kelsen needed not to adopt such solipsism but to provide an account of it.

===Toward a general theory of norms===
From the mid-1960s until his death in 1973, Kelsen branched out into general theory of norms. In a longer view, it was a return to his youthful passion for philosophy. His notes on this were published posthumously in 1979 as ''Allgemeine Theorie der Normen'' and appeared in English translation in 1990 as ''General Theory of Norms''. This work, however, neither offers a completed general theory of norms nor goes far toward locating the Pure Theory of Law within a general theory of norms.

== Biological ==
In a biological context [[chlorine]] behaves similarly to other [[atom]]s in the [[halogen]] chemical series, and thus reductive dechlorination can be considered to fall within a somewhat broader class of biological reactions known as [[reductive dehalogenation]] reactions, in which the removal of a halogen substituent from an organic molecule occurs with a simultaneous addition of electrons to the molecule. This can be further subdivided into two types of reaction processes, the first of which, hydrogenolysis, is the replacement of the halogen atom with a [[hydrogen]] atom. The second, vicinal reduction (sometimes called, dihaloelimination), involves the removal of two halogen atoms that are adjacent on the same [[alkane]] or [[alkene]] molecule, leading to the formation of an additional carbon-carbon bond.&lt;ref&gt;Mohn and Tiedje. Microbial reductive dehalogenation. Microbiol Rev (1992) vol. 56 (3) pp. 482-507 {{PMID|1406492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological reductive dechlorination is often catalyzed by certain species of [[bacteria]]. Sometimes the bacterial species are highly specialized for organochlorine respiration and even a particular electron donor, as in the case of ''[[Dehalococcoides]]'' and ''[[Dehalobacter]]''. In other examples, such as ''[[Anaeromyxobacter]]'', bacteria have been isolated that are capable of using a variety of electron donors and acceptors, with a subset of possible electron acceptors being organochlorines.&lt;ref&gt;Smidt and de Vos. Anaerobic microbial dehalogenation.

In many instances, microbiological reductive dechlorination of chlorinated organic molecules is important for [[bioremediation]] of polluted groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-10-01|title=Reductive Dehalogenases Come of Age in Biological Destruction of Organohalides|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779915001560|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|language=en|volume=33|issue=10|pages=595–610|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.07.004|pmid=26409778|issn=0167-7799|last1=Jugder|first1=Bat-Erdene|last2=Ertan|first2=Haluk|last3=Lee|first3=Matthew|last4=Manefield|first4=Michael|last5=Marquis|first5=Christopher P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jugder|first=Bat-Erdene|last2=Ertan|first2=Haluk|last3=Bohl|first3=Susanne|last4=Lee|first4=Matthew|last5=Marquis|first5=Christopher P.|last6=Manefield|first6=Michael|date=2016|title=Organohalide Respiring Bacteria and Reductive Dehalogenases: Key Tools in Organohalide Bioremediation|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|language=English|volume=7|pages=249|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2016.00249|pmid=26973626|pmc=4771760|issn=1664-302X}}&lt;/ref&gt; One particularly important example for public health&lt;ref&gt;Kielhorn et al.

Bioremediation of these [[chloroethene]]s can occur when other microorganisms at the contaminated site provide H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a natural byproduct of various [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] reactions. The dechlorinating bacteria use this H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as their electron donor, ultimately replacing [[chlorine]] atoms in the chloroethenes with hydrogen atoms via hydrogenolytic reductive dechlorination. If the soil and groundwater contain enough organic electron donor and the appropriate strains of ''Dehalococcoides'', this process can proceed until all of the chlorine atoms are removed, and TCE is dechlorinated completely via [[dichloroethene]] (DCE) and [[vinyl chloride]] (VC) to [[ethene]], a harmless end-product.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty.

Additionally, reductive dechlorination can be further used in bioremediation of other [[toxin]]s such as [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] and [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]]. The reductive dechlorination of PCBs is performed by anaerobic microorganisms that utilize the PCB as an electron sink. The result of this is the reduction of the "meta" site, followed by the "para" site, and finally the "ortho" site, leading to a dechlorinated product.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Payne|first=Rayford B.|last2=May|first2=Harold D.|last3=Sowers|first3=Kevin R.|date=2011-10-15|title=Enhanced Reductive Dechlorination of Polychlorinated Biphenyl Impacted Sediment by Bioaugmentation with a Dehalorespiring Bacterium|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=45|issue=20|pages=8772–8779|doi=10.1021/es201553c|pmid=21902247|issn=0013-936X|pmc=3210572|bibcode=2011EnST...45.8772P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tiedje|first1=James M.|last2=Quensen|first2=John F.|last3=Chee-Sanford|first3=Joann|last4=Schimel|first4=Joshua P.|last5=Boyd|first5=Stephen A.|title=Microbial reductive dechlorination of PCBs|journal=Biodegradation|date=1994|volume=4|issue=4|pages=231–240|doi=10.1007/BF00695971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=QUENSEN|first1=J.

==Electrochemical==

The [[electrochemical reduction]] of chlorinated chemicals such as [[chlorinated hydrocarbons]] and chlorofluorocarbons ([[CFCs]]) can be carried out by [[electrolysis]] in appropriate solvents, such as mixtures of water and alcohol. Some of the key components of an electrolytic cell are types of electrodes, electrolyte mediums, and use of mediators. The [[cathode]] transfers electrons to the molecule, which decomposes to produce the corresponding hydrocarbon (hydrogen atoms substitute the original chlorine atoms) and free chloride ions. For instance, the reductive dechlorination of CFCs is complete and produces several [[Hydrofluorocarbon|HFCs]] plus chloride.

Hydrodechlorination (HDC) is a type of reductive dechlorination that is useful due to its high reaction rate. It uses H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the reducing agent over a range of potential electrode reactors and [[Catalysis|catalysts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoke|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Gramiccioni|first2=Gary A.|last3=Balko|first3=Edward N.|title=Catalytic hydrodechlorination of chlorophenols|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0926337392800544|journal=Applied Catalysis B: Environmental|volume=1|issue=4|pages=285–296|doi=10.1016/0926-3373(92)80054-4|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the types of [[Catalysis|catalysts]] studied such as [[precious metal]]s (Pt, Pd, Rh), [[transition metal]]s (Ni and Mo), and [[Oxide|metal oxides]], a preference for [[precious metal]]s overrides the others.As an example, palladium (Pd) often adopts a lattice formation which can easily embed hydrogen gas making it more accessible to be readily oxidized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=I. Francis|last2=Fernando|first2=Quintus|last3=Korte|first3=Nic|date=1997-04-01|title=Electrochemical Dechlorination of 4-Chlorophenol to Phenol|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=31|issue=4|pages=1074–1078|doi=10.1021/es960602b|issn=0013-936X|bibcode=1997EnST...31.1074C}}&lt;/ref&gt; However a common issue for HDC is [[Catalysis|catalyst]] deactivation and regeneration. As catalysts are depleted, chlorine poisoning on surfaces can sometimes be observed, and on rare occasions, metal [[sintering]] and [[leaching (chemistry)|leaching]] occurs as a result.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ju|first=Xiumin|date=2005|title=Reductive Dehalogenation of Gas-phase Trichloroethylene using Heterogeneous Catalytic and Electrochemical Methods|url=http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/handle/10150/193594|journal=University of Arizona Campus Repository|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrochemical reduction can be performed at ambient pressure and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chemical degradation methods for wastes and pollutants : environmental and industrial applications|date=2003|publisher=M. Dekker|others=Tarr, Matthew A.|isbn=978-0203912553|location=New York|oclc=54061528}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will not disrupt microbial environments or raise extra cost for remediation. The process of dechlorination can be highly controlled to avoid toxic chlorinated intermediates and byproducts such as [[dioxin]]s from [[incineration]]. [[Trichloroethylene]] (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE) are common targets of treatment which are directly converted to environmentally benign products. Chlorinated alkenes and alkanes are converted to hydrogen chloride (HCl) which is then neutralized with a base.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, even though there are many potential benefits to adopting this method, research have mainly been conducted in a laboratory setting with a few cases of field studies making it not yet well established.

== Radiation ==

It is known that by gamma irradiation of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s that they can be converted into [[biphenyl]] and inorganic [[chloride]], this is formally a reduction of the organic compound as hydrogen is added. See the [[Polychlorinated biphenyl]] page for more details of this destruction method. This reductive destruction method works for many organochlorine compounds, for instance [[carbon tetrachloride]] when irradiated tends to form [[chloroform]] and chloride anions.

'''Shalem College''' ({{lang-he|המרכז האקדמי שלם}}, ''HaMerkaz HaAkademi Shalem'') is Israel's first [[liberal arts college]], located in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]. Founded in 2013, it aims to be Israel’s answer to America’s Ivy League universities, based on a core curriculum of humanities courses that are mandatory for each student, and around the idea of a vibrant, campus-focused student life.&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/jerusalem-vivendi/.premium-1.550962|title=From Moses to Machiavelli, Shalem College sets up shop as Israel’s answer to the Ivy League|author=[[Ilene Prusher]]|publisher=Haaretz|date=Oct 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A privately funded, undergraduate-degree-granting institution, Shalem currently boasts 94 enrolled students. The college is accredited by the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel]].

==History, academia, and campus life==
[[File:Shalem College building.jpg|thumb|300px|Shalem College Building]]
The [[Shalem Center]], a think tank, founded (and dissolved to become) Shalem College in January 2013, following accreditation by the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel]].&lt;ref name=forward/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/New-college-dedicated-to-the-humanities-opens-in-Jerusalem-328004] "New College Dedicated to the Humanities Opens in Jerusalem," [[Jerusalem Post]], October 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Daniel Gordis, the college's founding senior vice president, the idea was always for the center to provide the intellectual building blocks for a college with a strong [[humanities]] program, which [[Ivy League]] graduates in Israel, primarily from Princeton, had been hoping for since the late 1980s. The Center had translated classics such as ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', by [[Thomas Hobbes]], into Hebrew.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

The four-year degree program teaches a broad curriculum similar to those found in American liberal arts colleges. The college believes this contrasts with most universities in Israel, which it says were "founded by European immigrants and patterned on the classic German research university, [and] typically offer narrow training geared toward specific disciplines and careers."&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danielgordis.org/sitefiles/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Shalem-College-FAQs.pdf|title=Questions and Answers about Shalem College|publisher=Shalem Center|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831060359/http://danielgordis.org/sitefiles/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Shalem-College-FAQs.pdf|archivedate=2013-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college seeks to challenge the conventional Israeli student work ethic, in which many students—who earn their bachelor's degrees after completing military service and study while they are employed—treat class attendance as optional. The college plans to use financial incentives to encourage students to be active in campus life, including incentives to live close to campus.&lt;ref name=forward&gt;{{cite news|url=http://forward.com/articles/182583/first-american-style-liberal-arts-college-opens-do/?p=all|title=First American-Style Liberal Arts College Opens Doors In Israel This Fall|author=Nathan Jeffay|publisher=The Forward|date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every Tuesday, each student must fulfill mandatory community service, helping nearby Jewish and Arab neighbors.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

A private, undergraduate degree-granting institution, Shalem College has pioneered the use of required courses for all students alongside a choice of major concentrations. The centerpiece of the college’s academic community, the Core—which includes courses in [[philosophy]], [[history]], the natural and social sciences, [[literature]], and the [[fine arts]]—is unique in its integration of the study of key Western and [[Jewish]] texts. The college follows the [[Great Books]] model, in which students are required to read sources directly, and in the context of small, participatory seminars. The core curriculum includes Plato, Aristotle, Hume, Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Durkheim and Einstein. Key texts from Jewish tradition are drawn from the Babylonian Talmud, Maimonides, Spinoza and the Dead Sea Scrolls. Sections of the Quran are also compulsory.&lt;ref name=forward/&gt; After their first year, students will choose one of the two opening majors: the Interdisciplinary Program in Philosophy and Jewish Thought (IPJ), or Middle East and Islamic Studies (MEIS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=6935]"Shalem Center in Jerusalem Recognized as Academic Center," [[Israel HaYom]], January 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other majors in the fields of law, government and diplomacy, economics, and literature are planned to be added as the college matures.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt; The language of instruction is Hebrew, however, students are required to read extensively in English. Additionally, MEIS students are expected to learn Arabic and IPJ students interested in pursuing graduate study are expected to undertake study of an additional language, such as Greek or German.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt;

==Students and faculty==
The list of faculty includes the philosopher and ethicist [[Asa Kasher]], co-author of the IDF’s Code of Conduct; the jurist and human-rights activist [[Ruth Gavison]]; the renowned scholar of Jewish thought Shalom Rosenberg; and the noted historian of Zionism Ehud Luz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalem.ac.il/en/academics/faculty/] Faculty list on Shalem College Website.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinguished scholar of the Middle East [[Martin Kramer]] served as the college’s first president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=157391]"Martin Kramer Chosen to Serve as Founding President of Shalem College," [[Jerusalem Post]], October 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Shalem Center had a reputation for being dominated by immigrants from the United States, but the college has reportedly "broke[n] out of the Anglo mold."&lt;ref name=forward/&gt; The staff and student rosters span the political and religious spectrum, and the college is not affiliated with the ideology of the former research center.&lt;ref name=forward/&gt;&lt;ref name=jpost/&gt; Although no Arabs enrolled the first year, the school has made extensive efforts to boost diversity and recruit students from the Arab sector.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;&lt;ref name=faq/&gt;

Shalem accepts candidates on the basis of exams, intellectual capabilities, and demonstrated commitment to public service. Accepted applicants receive substantial financial aid packages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shalem.ac.il/he/%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%A8-%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%93-%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%92%D7%95%D7%AA/] Scholarship Information, Shalem College Website (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11786">'''Simulation-based optimization''' integrates [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] techniques into [[computer simulation|simulation]] analysis. Because of the complexity of the simulation, the [[objective function]] may become difficult and expensive to evaluate.

Once a system is mathematically modeled, computer-based simulations provide information about its behavior. Parametric simulation methods can be used to improve the performance of a system. In this method, the input of each variable is varied with other parameters remaining constant and the effect on the design objective is observed. This is a time-consuming method and improves the performance partially. To obtain the optimal solution with minimum computation and time, the problem is solved iteratively where in each iteration the solution moves closer to the optimum solution. Such methods are known as ‘numerical optimization’ or ‘simulation-based optimization’.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, Anh-Tuan, Sigrid Reiter, and Philippe Rigo. "[https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/155988/1/Nguyen%20AT.pdf A review on simulation-based optimization methods applied to building performance analysis]."''Applied Energy'' 113 (2014): 1043–1058.&lt;/ref&gt;

In simulation experiment, the goal is to evaluate the effect of different values of input variables on a system. However, the interest is sometimes in finding the optimal value for input variables in terms of the system outcomes. One way could be running simulation experiments for all possible input variables. However, this approach is not always practical due to several possible situations and it just makes it intractable to run experiments for each scenario. For example, there might be too many possible values for input variables, or the simulation model might be too complicated and expensive to run for suboptimal input variable values. In these cases, the goal is to find optimal values for the input variables rather than trying all possible values. This process is called simulation optimization.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Yolanda, and Anu Maria. "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.9192&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Simulation optimization: methods and applications]." ''Proceedings of the 29th conference on Winter simulation''. IEEE Computer Society, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific simulation–based optimization methods can be chosen according to figure 1 based on the decision variable types.&lt;ref&gt;Jalali, Hamed, and Inneke Van Nieuwenhuyse. "[https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/34623919.pdf Simulation optimization in inventory replenishment: a classification]." IIE Transactions 47.11 (2015): 1217-1235.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Slide1 1.jpg|thumb|Fig.1 Classification of simulation based optimization according to variable types]]
[[Optimization (computer science)|Optimization]] exists in two main branches of operational research:

''Optimization [[Parametric programming|parametric]] (static)'' – The objective is to find the values of the parameters, which are “static” for all states, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing a function. In this case, one can use [[mathematical programming]], such as [[linear programming]]. In this scenario, simulation helps when the parameters contain noise or the evaluation of the problem would demand excessive computer time, due to its complexity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Optimization [[Optimal control|control]] (dynamic)'' – This is used largely in [[computer science]] and [[electrical engineering]]. The optimal control is per state and the results change in each of them. One can use mathematical programming, as well as dynamic programming. In this scenario, simulation can generate random samples and solve complex and large-scale problems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Abhijit Gosavi, [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.462.5587&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Simulation‐Based Optimization: Parametric Optimization Techniques and Reinforcement Learning], Springer, 2nd Edition (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simulation-based optimization methods ==
The main approaches in simulation optimization are discussed below. 
&lt;ref name=Fu&gt;{{cite book|last=Fu|first=Michael, editor|title=Handbook of Simulation Optimization|publisher=Springer|year=2015|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493913831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statistical ranking and selection methods (R/S) ===
Ranking and selection methods are designed for problems where the alternatives are fixed and known, and simulation is used to estimate the system performance. 
In the simulation optimization setting, applicable methods include indifference zone approaches, optimal computing budget allocation, and knowledge gradient algorithms.

=== Response surface methodo&lt;nowiki/&gt;logy (RSM)===
In [[response surface methodology]], the objective is to find the relationship between the input variables and the response variables. The process starts from trying to fit a linear regression model. If the P-value turns out to be low, then a higher degree polynomial regression, which is usually quadratic, will be implemented. The process of finding a good relationship between input and response variables will be done for each simulation test. In simulation optimization, response surface method can be used to find the best input variables that produce desired outcomes in terms of response variables.&lt;ref&gt;Rahimi Mazrae Shahi, M., Fallah Mehdipour, E. and Amiri, M. (2016), [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/itor.12150 Optimization using simulation and response surface methodology with an application on subway train scheduling]. Intl. Trans. in Op. Res., 23: 797–811. doi:10.1111/itor.12150&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heuristic methods ===
[[Heuristic (computer science)|Heuristic methods]] change accuracy by speed. Their goal is to find a good solution faster than the traditional methods, when they are too slow or fail in solving the problem. Usually they find local optimal instead of the optimal value; however, the values are considered close enough of the final solution. Examples of this kind of method is [[tabu search]] or [[Genetic algorithm]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Metamodels enable researchers to obtain reliable approximate model outputs without running expensive and time-consuming computer simulations. Therefore, the process of model optimization can take less computation time and cost. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yousefi|first=Milad|last2=Yousefi|first2=Moslem|last3=Ferreira|first3=Ricardo Poley Martins|last4=Kim|first4=Joong Hoon|last5=Fogliatto|first5=Flavio S.|title=Chaotic genetic algorithm and Adaboost ensemble metamodeling approach for optimum resource planning in emergency departments|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0933365716305802|journal=Artificial Intelligence in Medicine|volume=84|pages=23–33|doi=10.1016/j.artmed.2017.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stochastic approximation ===
[[Stochastic approximation]] is used when the function cannot be computed directly, only estimated via noisy observations. In this scenarios, this method (or family of methods) looks for the extrema of these function. The objective function would be:&lt;ref&gt;Powell, W. (2011). ''Approximate Dynamic Programming Solving the Curses of Dimensionality'' (2nd ed., Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics). Hoboken: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{\text{x}\in\theta}{\min}f\bigl(\text{x}\bigr) = \underset{\text{x}\in\theta}{\min}\Epsilon[F\bigl(\text{x,y})]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;  is a random variable that represents the noise.

:&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the parameter that minimizes  &lt;math&gt;f\bigl(\text{x}\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;  is the domain of the parameter &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Derivative-free optimization methods ===
[[Derivative-free optimization]] is a subject of mathematical optimization. This method is applied to a certain optimization problem when its derivatives are unavailable or unreliable. Derivative-free methods establish a model based on sample function values or directly draw a sample set of function values without exploiting a detailed model. Since it needs no derivatives, it cannot be compared to derivative-based methods.&lt;ref&gt;Conn, A. R.; Scheinberg, K.; Vicente, L. N. (2009). [http://www.mat.uc.pt/~lnv/idfo/ ''Introduction to Derivative-Free Optimization'']. MPS-SIAM Book Series on Optimization. Philadelphia: SIAM. Retrieved 2014-01-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

For unconstrained optimization problems, it has the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{\text{x}\in\R^n}{\min}f\bigl(\text{x}\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;

The limitations of derivative-free optimization:

1. It is usually cannot handle optimization problems with a few tens of variables; the results via this method are usually not so accurate.

2. When confronted with minimizing non-convex functions, it will show its limitation.

3. Derivative-free optimization methods are simple and easy; however, they are not so good in theory and in practice.

=== Dynamic programming and neuro-dynamic programming ===

==== Dynamic programming ====
[[Dynamic programming]] deals with situations where decisions are made in stages. The key to this kind of problems is to trade off the present and future costs.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Leon; Cooper, Mary W. Introduction to dynamic programming. New York: Pergamon Press, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

One dynamic basic model has two features:

1) It has a discrete time dynamic system.

2) The cost function is additive over time.

For discrete features, dynamic programming has the form:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{k+1} = f_k(x_{k},u_{k},w_{k}) , k=0,1,...,N-1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; represents the index of discrete time.

:&lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; is the state of the time k, it contains the past information and prepare it for the future optimization.

:&lt;math&gt;u_k&lt;/math&gt; is the control variable.

:&lt;math&gt;w_k&lt;/math&gt; is the random parameter.

For the cost function, it has the form:

:&lt;math&gt;g_N(X_N) + \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} gk(x_k,u_k,W_k)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;g_N(X_N)&lt;/math&gt; is the cost at the end of the process.

As the cost cannot be optimized meaningfully, it can be used the expect value:

:&lt;math&gt;E\{g_N(X_N) + \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} g_k(x_k,u_k,W_k) \}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Neuro-dynamic programming ====
Neuro-dynamic programming is the same as dynamic programming except that the former has the concept of approximation architectures. It combines [[artificial intelligence]], simulation-base algorithms, and functional approach techniques. “Neuro” in this term origins from artificial intelligence community. It means learning how to make improved decisions for the future via built-in mechanism based on the current behavior. The most important part of neuro-dynamic programming is to build a trained neuro network for the optimal problem.&lt;ref&gt;Van Roy, B., Bertsekas, D., Lee, Y., &amp; Tsitsiklis, J. (1997). [https://web.stanford.edu/~bvr/pubs/retail.pdf Neuro-dynamic programming approach to retailer inventory management]. ''Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,'' ''4'', 4052-4057.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
Simulation based optimization has some limitations, such as the difficulty of creating a model that imitates the dynamic behavior of a system in a way that is considered good enough for its representation. Another problem is complexity in the determining uncontrollable parameters of both real-world system and simulation. Moreover, only a statistical estimation of real values can be obtained. It is not easy to determine the objective function, since it is a result of measurements, which can be harmful for the solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Prasetio, Y. (2005). ''[https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=9387151 Simulation-based optimization for complex stochastic systems]''. University of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deng, G., &amp; Ferris, Michael. (2007). ''Simulation-based Optimization,'' ProQuest Dissertations and Theses&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute''' or SWF Institute, or SWFI, is a global corporation analyzing public asset owners such as [[sovereign wealth fund]]s and other long-term governmental investors.  Initially, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute focused solely on sovereign wealth funds.  It has branched out to cover all types of public institutional investors.  The institute is a [[financial data vendor]] but provides information to the media as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Susanna|title=Why Norwegians Are Millionaires and Americans Are Paupers |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/norwegians-millionaires-norways-sovereign-wealth-fund/story?id=21488085|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blas|first=Javier|title=Protecting Nigeria oil SWF is no easy task |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/69325c28-2440-11e3-a8f7-00144feab7de.html#axzz2qJ6YUFpy|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abedine|first=Saad|title=Body of Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund chief found |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/03/30/uae.body/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Michael Maduell]] and Carl Linaburg in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Brad|title=Is there an SWF in your future? |url=http://www.irmagazine.com/articles/shareholder-targeting-id/20204/there-swf-your-future/|publisher=IR Magazine|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SWFI sells data subscriptions to asset managers, banks, researchers, universities, governments, institutional investors, asset owners, corporations, law firms and other entities.

==Transparency Ratings==
The SWFI came out with the Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index in 2008.  It is a 10-point scale based on ten principles of transparency, each adding one point to the index rating. The index is used by sovereign wealth funds in their annual reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan ranks among the highest in Transparency Index |url=http://www.oilfund.az/en_US/news/558/100/The-State-Oil-Fund-of-the-Republic-of-Azerbaijan-ranks-among-the-highest-in-Transparency-Index.asp|publisher=SOFAZ|accessdate=11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSIA Rated Transparent by Sovereign Wealth Institute |url=http://nsia.com.ng/nsia-rated-transparent-sovereign-wealth-institute/|publisher=Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data==
The SWFI tracks direct deals in sovereign wealth funds.  The value of global direct deals by sovereign-wealth funds hit $50.02 billion in the first half of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunkley|first=Dan |title=Sovereign-Wealth Funds Pump Near Record Amount of Cash in Deals |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/08/07/sovereign-wealth-funds-pump-near-record-amount-of-cash-in-deals/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SWFI tracks the assets of sovereign wealth funds, pensions, endowments and other asset owners.

'''''The Lost Books of the Bible and the Forgotten Books of Eden''''' (1926) is a collection of 17th-century and 18th-century English translations of some [[Old Testament Pseudepigrapha]] and [[New Testament Apocrypha]], some of which were assembled in the 1820s, and then republished with the current title in 1926.

==History of the translations==
Rutherford Hayes Platt, in the preface to his 1963 reprint of ''The Lost Books of the Bible and the Forgotten Books of Eden'' states:
:"First issued in 1926, this is the most popular collection of apocryphal and pseudepigraphal literature ever published."
The translations were first published, under this title, by an unknown editor in ''The Lost Books of the Bible'' Cleveland 1926, but the translations had previously been published many times. 

The book is, essentially, a combined reprint of earlier works.  The first half, ''Lost Books of the Bible'', is an unimproved reprint of a book published by [[William Hone]] in 1820, titled ''The Apocryphal New Testament'', itself a reprint of a translation of the [[Apostolic Fathers]] done in 1693 by [[William Wake]], who later became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and a smattering of medieval embellishments on the New Testament, from a book  by [[Jeremiah Jones (tutor)|Jeremiah Jones]] (1693-1724), posthumously published in 1736. In the three centuries since these were originally published, a great deal more is known about the [[Apostolic Fathers]] (including a good deal of the original text that was not available in 1693) and New Testament apocrypha.

The second half of the book, ''The Forgotten Books of Eden'', includes a translation originally published in 1882 of the "First and Second Books of Adam and Eve", translated first from ancient Ethiopic to German by [[Ernest Trumpp]] and then into English by [[Solomon Caesar Malan]], and a number of items of Old Testament pseudepigrapha, such as reprinted in the second volume of [[Robert Charles (scholar)|R.H. Charles]]'s ''Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament'' (Oxford, 1913).

More modern translations of these works include [[James H. Charlesworth|J. H. Charlesworth]], ed. ''Old Testament Pseudepigrapha''; [[Wilhelm Schneemelcher|W. Schneemelcher]], ed. ''New Testament Apocrypha''; and [[M. R. James]],  ''The Apocryphal New Testament''.

'''The Voice of the Performing Arts''' is a weekly [[radio]] show that explores the importance of [[Performing arts education|arts education]]. It airs each Saturday at 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time on [[WICR]] 88.7, a public radio station at the [[University of Indianapolis]]. The show also airs [http://wicronline.org online] and via the [[TuneIn]] Radio App. It is a one-hour program hosted by [[Steven Libman]], a long time performing arts leader and former CEO of the Center for the Performing Arts in [[Carmel, Indiana]] and Jeff Swensson, an arts education advocate and former superintendent of Carmel Clay Schools.

==Background==

During each episode of The Voice of the Performing Arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Voice of the Performing Arts|url=http://thevoiceoftheperformingarts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; guests from the arts community including arts professionals, educators and community leaders discuss the importance of introducing young people to the arts. Discussions include how they personally were drawn to the arts as a child and what can be done today to get young people excited about the arts. The hosts often ask guests to explain the “transformative moment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=That Transformative Moment|url=http://www.skybluewindow.org/indianapolis/that-transformative-moment/Content?oid=2144681}}&lt;/ref&gt;” when he or she fell in love with the performing arts.

The Voice of the Performing Arts debuted on March 30, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arts Talk Show Debuts Saturday on WICR|url=http://news.uindy.edu/2013/03/28/arts-talk-show-debuts-saturday-on-wicr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show originally aired at 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time before moving to the 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. time slot in February, 2014. The guests on the premiere episode included David Hochoy, artistic director of Dance Kaleidoscope; Kathleen Hacker, chair of UIndy’s Department of Music; Alan Davis, president and CEO of the [[Carmel Symphony Orchestra]]; and Soo Han, director of the Carmel High School Orchestra. Since the show’s launch The Voice of the Performing Arts has hosted guests from a variety of nationally recognized arts organizations as well as organizations and schools across Indiana.

{{Grammatical categories}}

In [[linguistics]], the '''topic''', or '''theme''', of a sentence is what is being talked about, and the '''comment''' ('''rheme''' or '''focus''') is what is being said about the topic. This opposition of the given/new information is called [[information structure]]. That the [[information structure]] of a clause is divided in this way is generally agreed on, but the boundary between topic/theme and comment/rheme/focus  depends on [[grammatical theory]]. 

The difference between "topic" and [[Subject (grammar)|grammatical subject]] is that topic is used to describe the information structure, or pragmatic structure of a clause and how it coheres with other clauses, whereas the subject is a purely grammatical category. ''Topic'' and ''subject'' must also be distinguished from ''actor'' (or ''agent''), the "doer". In English clauses with a verb in the passive voice, for instance, the topic is typically the subject, while the agent may be omitted or may follow the preposition ''by''. In some languages, word order and other [[Syntax|syntactic phenomena]] are determined largely by the topic–comment (theme–rheme) structure. These languages are sometimes referred to as [[topic-prominent language]]s. Korean and Japanese are often given as examples of this.

The distinction was probably first suggested by [[Henri Weil]] in 1844&lt;ref&gt;H. Weil, De l’ordre des mots dans les langues anciennes compares aux
langues modernes: question de grammaire gnrale. Joubert, 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;. He established the
connection between [[information structure]] and word order. [[Georg von der Gabelentz]] distinguished '''psychological subject''' (roughly topic) and '''psychological object''' (roughly focus). In the [[Prague school]], the dichotomy, termed '''topic–focus articulation''', has been studied mainly by [[Vilém Mathesius]]&lt;ref&gt;V. Mathesius and J. Vachek, A Functional Analysis of Present Day
English on a General Linguistic Basis, ser. Janua linguarum : Series
practica / Ianua linguarum / Series practica. Mouton, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Jan Firbas]], [[František Daneš]], [[Petr Sgall]] and [[Eva Hajičová]]. They have been concerned mainly by its relation to intonation and word-order. [[Mathesius]] also pointed that the topic does not provide new information but connects the sentence to the context. The work of [[Michael Halliday]] in the 1960s is responsible for developing linguistic science through his [[systemic functional linguistics]] model for English&lt;ref&gt;M.A.K.Halliday, An Introduction to Functional Grammar, 2nd ed.
London: Arnold, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definitions ==

The sentence- or clause-level "topic", or "theme", can be defined in a number of different ways. Among the most common are
*a) the phrase in a clause that the rest of the clause is understood to be about,
*b) a special position in a clause (often at the right or left-edge of the clause) where topics typically appear.

In an ordinary English clause, the subject is normally the same as the topic/theme (example 1), even in the passive voice (where the subject is a patient, not an agent: example 2):
*(1) ''The dog'' bit the little girl.
*(2) ''The little girl'' was bitten by the dog.

These clauses have different topics: the first is about ''the dog'', and the second about ''the little girl''.

In English it is also possible to use other sentence structures to show the topic of the sentence, as in the following:
*(3) ''As for the little girl'', the dog bit her.
*(4) ''It was the little girl'' that the dog bit.

The case of [[Syntactic expletive|expletives]] is sometimes rather complex. Consider sentences with expletives (meaningless subjects), like:

*(6) It is raining.
*(7) There is some room in this house.
*(8) There are two days in the year in which the day and the night are equal in length.

In these examples the syntactic subject position (to the left of the verb) is manned by the meaningless expletive ("it" or "there"), whose sole purpose is satisfying the [[extended projection principle]], and is nevertheless necessary. In these sentences the topic is never the subject, but is determined [[Pragmatics|pragmatically]]. In all these cases, the whole sentence refers to the comment part&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gotze, Stephanie Dipper, and Stavros Skopeteas. 2007. Information Structure in Cross-Linguistic Corpora: Annotation Guidelines for Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Information Structure. Interdisciplinary Studies on Information Structure (ISIS), Working papers of the SFB 632, Vol. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The relation between topic/theme and comment/rheme/focus should not be confused with the topic-comment relation in [[Rhetorical structure theory]] Discourse Treebank (RST-DT corpus) where it is defined as "a general statement or topic of discussion is introduced, after which a specific remark is made on the statement or topic" (ex. "[As far as the pound goes,] [some traders say a slide toward support at 1.5500 may be a favorable development for the dollar this week.]") &lt;ref&gt;L. Carlson and D. Marcu, “Discourse tagging reference manual,” ISI Technical Report ISI-TR-545, vol. 54, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;L. Ermakova and J. Mothe. 2016. Document re-ranking based on topic-comment structure. In X IEEE International Conference RCIS, Grenoble, France, June 1-3, 2016. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Realization of topic–comment ==
Different languages mark topics in different ways. Distinct intonation and word-order are the most common means. The tendency to place topicalized constituents sentence-initially ("topic fronting") is widespread. Topic fronting refers to placing the topic at the beginning
of a clause regardless whether it is marked or not&lt;ref&gt;D. Bring, Topic and Comment. Cambridge University Press, 2011, three
entries for: Patrick Colm Hogan (ed.) The Cambridge Encyclopedia of
the Language Sciences. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Again, linguists disagree on many details. 

Languages often show different kinds of grammar for sentences that introduce new topics and those that continue discussing previously established topics. 

When a sentence continues discussing a previously established topic, it is likely to use pronouns to refer to the topic. Such topics tend to be subjects.  In many languages, pronouns referring to previously established topics will show [[pro-drop]].

=== In English ===
The topic/theme comes first in the clause, and is typically marked out by intonation as well.&lt;ref&gt;MAK Halliday (1994). ''An introduction to functional grammar'', 2nd ed., Hodder Arnold: London, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In other languages===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
* [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]]: the topic is normally marked with a [[postposition]] such as {{Nihongo||は|-wa}} or 는/은, ''-(n)eun''.
* In [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivorian French]], the topic is marked by the postposition « là ». The topic can be a noun or a nominal group but not necessarily : « Voiture-là est jolie deh » ; « Aujourd'hui-là il fait chaud » ; « Pour toi-là n'est pas comme pour moi hein » ; « Nous qui sommes ici-là, on attend ça seulement ».
* So-called free-word order languages (e.g. Russian, [[Czech language|Czech]], to a certain extent [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[German language|German]]) use word-order as the primary means. Usually the topic precedes focus. However, for example in Czech, both orders are possible. The order with comment sentence-initial is referred as ''subjective'' ([[Vilém Mathesius]] invented the term and opposed it to ''objective'') and expresses certain emotional involvement.  The two orders are distinguished by intonation.
* In [[Hebrew language|modern Hebrew]], a topic may follow its comment. In this case, the syntactic subject of the sentence is an expletive זה ("ze", lit. "this"). For example, זה מאד מענין הספר הזה "ze meod meanyen ha-sefer ha-ze" (lit. "This is very interesting this book") means "This book is very interesting".
* In [[American Sign Language#Topic and main clauses|American Sign Language]], a topic can be declared at the beginning of a sentence (indicated by raised eyebrows and head tilt) describing the object, then the rest of the sentence describes what happens to that object.

== Practical applications ==
The main application of the topic-comment structure is in the domain of speech technology, especially the design of embodied conversational agents (intonational focus assignment, relation between information structure and posture and gesture)&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Justine, ed. Embodied conversational agents. MIT press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;. There were some attempts to apply the theory of topic/comment for the information retrieval &lt;ref&gt;A. Bouchachia and R. Mittermeir, “A neural cascade architecture for
document retrieval,” in Neural Networks, 2003. Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on, vol. 3. IEEE, 2003, pp. 1915–1920.&lt;/ref&gt; and the automatic summarization &lt;ref&gt;L. Ermakova, J. Mothe, A. Firsov. A Metric for Sentence Ordering Assessment Based on Topic-Comment

Transduction in the [[nervous system]] typically refers to stimulus-alerting events wherein a physical stimulus is converted into an [[action potential]], which is transmitted along axons towards the central nervous system for integration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41266312|title=Molecular cell biology|date=2000|publisher=W.H. Freeman|others=Lodish, Harvey F.|isbn=0716731363|edition= 4th|location=New York|oclc=41266312}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a step in the larger process of [[sensory processing]].

A receptor cell converts the energy in a stimulus into an electrical signal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Receptors are broadly split into two main categories: exteroceptors, which receive external sensory stimuli, and interoceptors, which receive internal sensory stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exteroceptor|title=Definition of EXTEROCEPTOR|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interoceptor|title=Definition of INTEROCEPTOR|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transduction and the senses==

===The visual system===
{{Main|Visual phototransduction}}
In the [[visual system]], sensory cells called [[Rod cell|rod]] and [[cone cell]]s in the [[retina]] convert the physical energy of [[light]] signals into [[electrical impulse]]s that travel to the [[brain]]. The light causes a conformational change in a protein called [[rhodopsin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This conformational change sets in motion a series of molecular events that result in a reduction of the electrochemical gradient of the photoreceptor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The decrease in the electrochemical gradient causes a reduction in the electrical signals going to the brain. Thus, in this example, more light hitting the photoreceptor results in the transduction of a signal into fewer electrical impulses, effectively communicating that stimulus to the brain. A change in neurotransmitter release is mediated through a second messenger system. Note that the change in neurotransmitter release is by rods. Because of the change, a change in light intensity causes the response of the rods to be much slower than expected (for a process associated with the nervous system).&lt;ref name="Silverthorn, Dee Unglaub 2004"&gt;Silverthorn, Dee Unglaub. Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach, 3rd Edition, Inc, San Francisco, CA, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The auditory system===
{{Main|Neuronal encoding of sound}}
In the [[auditory system]], sound vibrations (mechanical energy) are transduced into electrical energy by hair cells in the inner ear. Sound vibrations from an object cause vibrations in air molecules, which in turn, vibrate the [[ear drum]]. The movement of the eardrum causes the bones of the middle ear (the [[ossicles]]) to vibrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koike|first=Takuji|last2=Wada|first2=Hiroshi|last3=Kobayashi|first3=Toshimitsu|title=Modeling of the human middle ear using the finite-element method|url=https://doi.org/10.1121/1.1451073|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=111|issue=3|pages=1306–1317|doi=10.1121/1.1451073}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/123956006|title=Anatomy and physiology of hearing for audiologists|last=W.|first=Clark, William|date=2008|publisher=Thomson Delmar|others=Ohlemiller, Kevin K.|isbn=9781401814441|location=Clifton Park, NY|oclc=123956006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These vibrations then pass into the [[cochlea]], the organ of hearing. Within the cochlea, the hair cells on the sensory epithelium of the [[organ of Corti]] bend and cause movement of the basilar membrane. The membrane undulates in different sized waves according to the frequency of the sound. Hair cells are then able to convert this movement (mechanical energy) into electrical signals (graded receptor potentials) which travel along auditory nerves to hearing centres in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Eatock, R. (2010). Auditory receptors and transduction. In E. Goldstein (Ed.), Encyclopedia of perception. (pp. 184-187). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. doi: 10.4135/9781412972000.n63&lt;/ref&gt;

===The olfactory system===
{{Main|Olfactory transduction}}
In the [[olfactory system]], odorant molecules in the mucus bind to G-protein receptors on olfactory cells. The G-protein activates a downstream signalling cascade that causes increased level of cyclic-AMP (cAMP), which trigger neurotransmitter release.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Ronnett, Gabriele V., &amp; Moon, Cheil. L|title=G PROTEINS AND OLFACTORY SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|year=2002|volume=64|issue=1|pages=189–222|doi=10.1146/annurev.physiol.64.082701.102219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The gustatory system===
{{Main|Gustatory system}}
In the [[gustatory system]], perception of five primary [[Basic tastes|taste qualities]] (sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami [savoriness] ) depends on taste transduction pathways, through taste receptor cells, G proteins, ion channels, and effector enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy A Gilbertson; Sami Damak; Robert F Margolskee, "The molecular physiology of taste transduction", Current Opinion in Neurobiology (August 2000), 10 (4), pg. 519-527&lt;/ref&gt;

===The somatosensory system===
{{Main|Mechanotransduction}}
In the [[somatosensory system]] the sensory transduction mainly involves the conversion of the mechanical signal such as pressure, skin compression, stretch, vibration to electro-ionic impulses through the process of [[mechanotransduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TOH.2014.2369422 |title=Vibrotactile Sensitivity Threshold: Nonlinear Stochastic Mechanotransduction Model of the Pacinian Corpuscle |year=2015 |last1=Biswas |first1=Abhijit |journal=IEEE Transactions on Haptics |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=102–113 |pmid=25398183 |last2=Manivannan |first2=M. |last3=Srinivasan |first3=Mandyam A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes the sensory transduction related to [[thermoception]] and [[nociception]].

'''Translation''' as a [[rhetorical device]] is a form of [[parody]], where a [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] [[paraphrase]] of a source quotation is given to mock its author; to enhance the [[irony]], it is furthermore stated that the version being given is merely a translation into the speaker's language, implying that the original speaker was unduly obscure or [[Monologue|ranting]]. Given the nature of [[Usenet]] forums, parodic translation is prevalent in [[flame wars]], where remarks such as "Translation: 'I do not have a clue and am throwing mud'" are used to imply &amp;mdash; on very little ground &amp;mdash; that another poster is not making any appreciable contribution to the subject.

Unlike other forms of parody, translation has a relatively recent history; early usages of the device can be seen in the work of the Viennese literary critic and journalist [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]],  who claimed to translate from other journalists' &amp;mdash; famously former friend [[Maximilian Harden|Harden]] &amp;mdash; and from ''Moskauderwelch'' &amp;mdash; a derisive term for the highly elaborate [[Marxist]] [[jargon]] of the time, a pun on ''Moskau'', Moscow, and ''Kauderwelch'', gibberish. Kraus' influence is notable in [[Karl Popper]]; while translation of scientific theories into [[principle of verification|verificationist]] terms had been a standard procedure in [[logical positivism]] for some time, Popper's criticism of several philosophers and scientists that failed to comply with his notion of the [[scientific method]] took a mocking quality reminiscent of the former.

A '''typed [[lambda calculus]]''' is a typed [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] that uses the lambda-symbol (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) to denote anonymous function abstraction. In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see kinds below). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the [[untyped lambda calculus]] but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and ''untyped lambda calculus'' a special case with only one type.

Typed lambda calculi are foundational [[programming languages]] and are the base of typed [[functional programming languages]] such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and, more indirectly, typed [[imperative programming|imperative programming languages]]. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of [[type systems]] for programming languages; here typability usually captures desirable properties of the program, e.g. the program will not cause a memory access violation.

Typed lambda calculi are closely related to [[mathematical logic]] and [[proof theory]] via the [[Curry&amp;ndash;Howard isomorphism]] and they can be considered as the [[internal language]] of classes of [[category theory|categories]], e.g. the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] is the language of [[cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed categories]] (CCCs).

== Kinds of typed lambda calculi ==
Various typed lambda calculi have been studied. The [[simply typed lambda calculus]] has only one [[type constructor]], the arrow &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt;, and its only types are [[basic type]]s and [[function type]]s &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to\tau&lt;/math&gt;. [[Dialectica interpretation|System T]] extends the simply typed lambda calculus with a type of natural numbers and higher order primitive recursion; in this system all functions provably recursive in [[Peano arithmetic]] are definable. [[System F]] allows polymorphism by using universal quantification over all types; from a logical perspective it can describe all functions that are provably total in [[second-order logic]]. Lambda calculi with [[dependent types]] are the base of [[intuitionistic type theory]], the [[calculus of constructions]] and the [[LF (logical framework)|logical framework]] (LF), a pure lambda calculus with dependent types. Based on work by Berardi on [[pure type system]]s, [[Henk Barendregt]] proposed the [[Lambda cube]] to systematize the relations of pure typed lambda calculi (including simply typed lambda calculus, System F, LF and the calculus of constructions).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Some typed lambda calculi introduce a notion of ''[[subtype|subtyping]]'', i.e. if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a subtype of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then all terms of type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; also have type &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Typed lambda calculi with subtyping are the simply typed lambda calculus with conjunctive types and [[System F-sub|System F&lt;sub&gt;&lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;]].

All the systems mentioned so far, with the exception of the untyped lambda calculus, are ''[[strongly normalizing]]'': all computations terminate. As a consequence they are consistent as a logic, i.e. there are uninhabited types. There exist, however, typed lambda calculi that are not strongly normalizing. For example the dependently typed lambda calculus with a type of all types (Type : Type) is not normalizing due to [[Girard's paradox]]. This system is also the simplest pure type system, a formalism which generalizes the Lambda cube. Systems with explicit recursion combinators, such as [[Gordon Plotkin|Plotkin's]] PCF, are not normalizing, but they are not intended to be interpreted as a logic. Indeed, [[Programming language for Computable Functions|PCF]] (for Programming language for Computable Functions) is a prototypical, typed functional programming language, where types are used to ensure that programs are well-behaved but not necessarily terminating.

== Applications to programming languages ==
In [[computer programming]], the routines (functions, procedures, methods) of [[strongly typed programming language]]s closely correspond to typed lambda expressions.

The '''University of Helsinki''' ({{lang-fi|Helsingin yliopisto}}, {{lang-sv|Helsingfors universitet}}, {{lang-la|Universitas Helsingiensis}}, abbreviated '''UH''') is a university located in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] since 1829, but was founded in the city of [[Turku]] (in Swedish ''Åbo'') in 1640 as the ''[[Royal Academy of Åbo]]'', at that time part of the [[Swedish Empire]]. It is the oldest and largest university in Finland with the widest range of disciplines available. Around 36,500 students are currently enrolled in the degree programs of the university spread across 11 faculties and 11 research institutes.

As of 1 August 2005, the university complies with the harmonized structure of the Europe-wide [[Bologna Process]] and offers Bachelor, Master, [[Licenciate]], and [[Doctorate|Doctoral degrees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/tutkinnonuudistus/materiaalit/raportit/Bologna_review_20041122.pdf|title=Bologna Process at the University of Helsinki|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172641/http://www.helsinki.fi/tutkinnonuudistus/materiaalit/raportit/Bologna_review_20041122.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to degree programmes is usually determined by entrance examinations, in the case of bachelor's degrees, and by prior degree results, in the case of master and postgraduate degrees.  Entrance is particularly selective (circa 15% of the yearly applicants are admitted). It has been ranked a top 100 university in the world according to the 2016 ARWU, QS and THE rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/Institution.jsp?param=University%20of%20Helsinki |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118045130/http://www.shanghairanking.com/Institution.jsp?param=University%20of%20Helsinki |archive-date=18 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings|title=World University Rankings|work=Top Universities|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-of-helsinki?ranking-dataset=133819|title=World University Rankings 2016|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is bilingual, with teaching by law provided both in Finnish and Swedish. Since Swedish, albeit an official language of Finland, is a minority language, Finnish is by far the dominating language at the university. Teaching in English is extensive throughout the university at Master, Licentiate, and Doctoral levels, making it a ''de facto'' third language of instruction.

Remaining true to its traditionally strong [[Humboldtian model of higher education|Humboldtian]] ethos, the University of Helsinki places heavy emphasis on high-quality teaching and research of a top international standard.&lt;ref&gt;''Helsingin Sanomat'', International Edition – Metro, 2.3.2006. "Assay finds research at University of Helsinki is of high international standard".[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Assay+finds+research+at+University+of+Helsinki+is+of+high+international+standard/1135218988844]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of various prominent international university networks, such as [[Europaeum]], [[Institutional Network of the Universities from the Capitals of Europe|UNICA]],&lt;ref&gt;UNICA = "Institutional Network of the Universities from the Capitals of Europe".&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Utrecht Network]], and is a founding member of the [[League of European Research Universities]].

==History==
[[File:Cristina de Suecia a caballo (Bourdon).jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Queen Christina of Sweden]], University Founder and Patron]]
[[File:Unioninkatu 34.jpg|thumb|330px|University of Helsinki (Main Building)|right]]
{{For|the early history (1640-1809)|Royal Academy of Turku}}

===Royal Academy of Åbo 1640–1828===
{{main|Royal Academy of Turku}}
The first predecessor of the university, [[Katedralskolan i Åbo|The Cathedral School of Åbo]], was presumably founded in 1276 for education of boys to become servants of the Church. As the university was founded in 1640 by [[Queen Christina of Sweden]] (1626–1689) in [[Turku]] (Sw. Åbo), as the [[Royal Academy of Turku|Åbo Kungliga Akademi]] ({{lang-la|Regia Academia Aboensis}}), the senior part of the school formed the core of the new university, while the junior year courses formed a grammar school. It was the third [[university]] founded in the [[Swedish Empire]], following [[Uppsala University]] and the [[Academia Gustaviana]] in [[Tartu|Dorpat]] (predecessor to the [[University of Tartu]] in [[Estonia]]).

===Imperial Alexander University in Finland 1828–1919===
The second period of the university's history covers the period when Finland was a Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire, from 1809 to 1917. As Finland became part of the Russian Empire in 1809, [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor Alexander I]] expanded the university and allocated substantial funds to it. Following the [[Great Fire of Turku]] in 1827, higher education within the country was moved to Helsinki, the new administrative heart of the Grand Duchy, in 1828, and renamed the ''Imperial Alexander University in Finland'' in honour of the late benefactor of the university. In the capital the primary task of the university was to educate the Grand Duchy’s civil servants.

The university became a community subscribing to the new [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldtian]] ideals of science and culture, studying humanity and its living environment by means of scientific methods. The new statutes of the university enacted in 1828 defined the task of the university as promoting the development of “the Sciences and Humanities within Finland and, furthermore, educating the youth for the service of the Emperor and the Fatherland”.

The Alexander University was a centre of national life that promoted the birth of an independent Finnish State and the development of Finnish identity. The great men of 19th century Finland, [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]], [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]], [[Elias Lönnrot]] and [[Zachris Topelius]], were all involved in the activities of the university. The university became a major center of Finnish cultural, political, and legal life in 19th century Finland, and became a remarkable ''primum mobile'' of the nationalist and liberal cultural movements, political parties, and student organisations.

In the 19th century university research changed from being collection-centred to being experimental, empirical, and analytical. The more scientific approach of the university led to specialisation and created new disciplines. As the scientific disciplines developed, Finland received ever more scholarly knowledge and highly educated people, some of whom entered rapidly evolving industry or the government.
[[File:National Library of Finland.jpg|thumb|280px|right|National Library of Finland/Kansalliskirjasto]]

===University of Helsinki 1919–present===
The third period of the university's history began with the creation of the independent Republic of Finland in 1917, and with the renaming of the university as the ''University of Helsinki''. Once Finland gained her independence in 1917 the university was given a crucial role in building the nation state and, after [[World War II]], the welfare state. Members of the academic community promoted the international relations of the new state and the development of its economic life. Furthermore, they were actively involved in national politics and the struggle for equality.

In the [[interwar period]] the university was the scene of a conflict between those who wanted to advance the usage of Finnish language in the university, to the detriment of Swedish and those who opposed such move.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-Universitetsadresserna |title=Universitetsadresserna |last=Sundman |first=Lasse  |date=24 April 2011 |website=[[Uppslagsverket Finland]] |publisher= |access-date=30 November 2017 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographer [[Väinö Tanner (geographer)|Väinö Tanner]] was one of the most vocal defenders of Swedish language usage.&lt;ref name=UppslagsverketFi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-TannerVaeinoe |title=Tanner, Väinö |last=Lindberg |first=Johan  |date=5 August 2011 |website=[[Uppslagsverket Finland]] |publisher= |access-date=30 November 2017 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swedish People's Party of Finland]] initiated a campaign collecting 153 914 signatures in defense of the Swedish language that were handed to the parliament and government in October 1934.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv/&gt; On an international front academics from Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland sent letters to the diplomatic representations of Finland in their respective countries warning about a weakening of the Nordic unity that would result from diminishing the role of Swedish in the University of Helsinki.&lt;ref name=UppslagsFiUniv/&gt;

In the 20th century, scholarly research at the University of Helsinki reached the level of the European elite in many disciplines. This was manifested, among other things, by international recognitions granted to its professors, such as the [[Fields Medal]] received by the mathematician [[Lars Ahlfors]] (1936), the Nobel Prize in Chemistry granted to Professor [[A.I. Virtanen]] (1945) and the Nobel Prize in Medicine shared by Professor [[Ragnar Granit]] (1967).

After World War II, University research focused on improving Finnish living conditions and supporting major changes in the structure of society and business. The university also contributed to the breakthrough of modern technology.{{vague|date=December 2011}}{{examples|date=December 2011}}

The progress of scientific development created many new disciplines and faculties at the University of Helsinki. At present the university comprises 11 faculties, 500 professors and almost 40,000 students. The university has established as its goal to further its position as one of Europe’s top multidisciplinary research universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/yliopistonhistoria/english/imperal.htm|title=University of Helsinki|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==

[[File:Main Auditorium, Helsinki University.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Main Auditorium, University of Helsinki]]
The university is located on four main [[campus]]es. Originally, the entire university was located in the very centre of Helsinki, but due to the rapid growth of the university since the 1930s, premises have been built and acquired in other areas.

===City Centre Campus===
The historical [[City Centre Campus]] has been the hub of activity ever since the university moved from Turku to Helsinki in the early 19th century. The campus has a central location and reflects the architectural style of this part of the city. The university buildings in the city center house the Faculties of Theology, Law, Arts, Behavioural Sciences and Social Sciences plus administrative functions. Most of the buildings on the campus have a major architectural significance ranging from the dominating Neo-Classical, through the Jugendstil, to 20th century Modernism.
[[File:Helsinki--Psyc Department.jpg|thumb|Minerva, Department of Teacher Education]]
The City Centre Campus, extending around the historical centre of Helsinki, Senate Square, and Kruununhaka city district, is the administrative heart of the University of Helsinki and has the largest concentration of faculties in Helsinki.

After the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, Emperor Nicholas I ordered the Royal Academy of Turku be moved to the new capital city of the Grand Duchy of Finland, Helsinki, where the Imperial Alexander University in Finland began to operate the next year. Helsinki was to become Finland's window to the world; a European city to which the university belonged as an integral part. [[Carl Ludvig Engel]], architect, was given the assignment of designing an Empire-style main building next to Senate Square, facing the Imperial Senate. The main building was completed in 1832. Thanks to the lessons learnt from the fire of Turku, the library was built separate from other premises. The library and several faculty buildings in the campus were also designed by Engel.

[[File:HU-main-building-1944b.jpg|thumb|University Main Building on fire after Soviet bombings in 1944.]]
The main building as well as other buildings of the campus were badly damaged during the [[Bombing of Helsinki in World War II|Soviet bombings in World War II]] but rebuilt after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museo.helsinki.fi/yliopiston_historia/pommitus.htm|title=Helsingin suurpommitukset ja yliopisto|author=Kati Heinämies|language=fi|publisher=Helsinki University Museum Arppeanum|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan concerning the concentration of university facilities dating back to the 1980s, aimed to achieve a closer unity between facilities. The City Centre Campus does not stand out from the rest of the urban environment but is a part of the city, in line with the old university tradition. The university facilities still form a functional and coherent whole, consisting not only of historically valuable buildings, but also of facilities for 20,000 students and 3,000 teachers and other staff.

===Kumpula Campus===
The [[Kumpula Campus]], housing the Faculty of Science, is located four kilometers north from the centre of Helsinki near tram lines 6 and 8. The campus houses the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics, Computer Science, and Geosciences and Geography.

The university departments were located in Kumpula for the first time in 1978 when the City of Helsinki leased the area for the university. A planning competition for the city plan for the area was held a year earlier. In the 1980s, the Accelerator Laboratory of the Department of Physics was quarried into Kumpula rock and the construction of Kumpula Botanical Garden began in 1987. It was not, however, until the 1990s when the construction work proper began, transforming the area into a significant campus.
[[File:Kumpula Campus Physicum.jpg|thumb|Kumpula Campus Physicum]]
The Chemicum, the building housing the Department of Chemistry and VERIFIN (Finnish Institute for Verification of the Chemical Weapons Convention), and the Physicum, which provides facilities for physics, geology and geography are located on Kumpula campus surrounding a square named after the Finnish Nobel prize winner, A. I. Virtanen. Kumpula Campus Library is also located in the Physicum. The Kumpula Sports Centre is planned for the recreational use of both university staff and students and citizens of Helsinki alike. Completed in 2004, the Exactum provides facilities for seismology, computer science and mathematical subjects, as well as administrative services.

The campus comprises two main parts: the Botanical Garden, surrounding the old building stock of Kumpula manor and the modern new building stock located a couple of hundred metres north of the manor. The greenness of the area makes the dynamic campus stand out as a unique, distinctive complex. The campus offers study and research facilities for 6,000 students and 1,000 teachers. The Finnish Meteorological Institute moved to the area in 2005. That building is known as Dynamicum.

===Meilahti Campus===
[[File:Kaisaniemi Botanical Garden Water lily room 2011-08-05 1.jpg|thumb|Kaisaniemi Botanical Garden Water lily room 2011-08-05 1]]
The [[Meilahti Campus]], with the Faculty of Medicine, is a part of the [[Meilahti]] Hospital District on the edge of the city centre. Just a few kilometres from the City Centre Campus, the Meilahti area has been transformed into a cradle of top research on medicine, 'Medilahti'. Established in the 1930s, the Women's Clinic was accompanied by Finland's leading hospital, Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH) in 1966. The same year saw the completion of facilities for theoretical subject departments on Haartmaninkatu street. The building is now being renovated and extended. The latest completed facilities in the campus include the National Library of Health Sciences Terkko and the research and teaching centre Biomedicum, which accommodates 1,200 researchers.

The Ruskeasuo premises, including the Department of Dentistry, Institute for Oral Health, Department of Public Health and Department of Forensic Medicine, also belong to the Meilahti campus. The Meilahti and Ruskeasuo areas form a close-knit complex providing a meeting place for medical education, international top-level research and nursing. The campus is a workplace for 2,000 students and 1,500 teachers.

Thanks to the years-long project to combine the teaching facilities of the Faculty of Medicine, Meilahti is now a functional unity of medicine and health care. The atmosphere in the campus inspires people in their studies, research and international co-operation.

Although the Meilahti campus is intertwined with the rest of Meilahti district, it succeeds in forming a clear-cut campus area with its hospital-type building stock.

===Viikki Campus===
The [[Viikki Campus]] is located in the semi-suburban greenspace of the [[Viikki]] area, some 8 kilometres north-east of the city centre. It houses the Faculties of Agriculture and Forestry, Biosciences, Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacy. It is an important concentration in the field of biosciences, even by European standards. Indeed, it is often called the bioscience campus or the “green campus”.

In addition to biosciences, the campus is home to a wide range of other life science researchers and students in such fields as environmental science, veterinary medicine, food research and economics. Numerous international research groups also work on the Viikki Campus. The Viikki Campus is the location of four faculties, two independent institutes and the Viikki Science Library.

It also attracts an increasing number of businesses to the Helsinki Business and Science Park. The Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute and the Finnish Food Safety Authority, Evira, have also moved to Viikki and negotiations are under way to relocate MTT Agrifood Research Finland to Viikki to complement the Department of Economics and Management.

The Viikki Campus unites a multidisciplinary science community of more than 6,500 students and 1,600 teachers, a residential area emphasising ecological values and the natural surroundings, including recreational areas and nature reserves, and forms a unique whole. The campus also has the Viikinlahti conservation area, which is particularly popular among bird watchers.

==Libraries and museums==

===The National Library of Finland===
The [[National Library of Finland]] is the foremost research library in Finland and the main branch of the University of Helsinki's library system. The National Library of Finland is the oldest and largest scholarly library in Finland as well as one of the largest independent institutes at the University of Helsinki. It is responsible for the collection, description, preservation and accessibility of Finland’s printed national heritage and the unique collections under its care. The National Library also serves as a national service and development centre for the library sector and promotes national and international cooperation in the field.

===The Helsinki University Main Library===
[[File:Kaisa-talo3.jpg|thumb|150px|The new Main Library in Kaisa House.|right]]
The Main Library of the university is used by students for research and studying. Located a few blocks down the street from the university's main building in the city center, the new Main Library was opened in 2012 in the Kaisa House. The new library merged the undergraduate library and four dispersed faculty libraries of the city center campus to a collection of approximately 1.5 million books.&lt;ref name="ht-kaisa-library"/&gt; The architecture of the new building, designed by Anttinen Oiva Architects, has been praised&lt;ref name="ht-kaisa-library"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/4356-new-university-library-a-wonder-of-design-and-learning-2.html|title=New university library a wonder of design and learning|work=Helsinki Times|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/16082012/kaupunki/Valo+tulvii+Kaisa-kirjastoon/a1345006266956|title=Valo tulvii Kaisa-kirjastoon|last=Salmela|first=Marja|work=Helsingin Sanomat|language=fi|trans-title=Light floods Kaisa Library|date=16 August 2012|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received several awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/library/contact-us/for-media/main-library-in-kaisa-house/|title=Pääkirjasto Kaisa-talossa|publisher=Helsinki University Library|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Helsinki University Museum===
The [[Helsinki University Museum]] is the museum of the University of Helsinki and was located until June 2014 on ''Snellmanninkatu'' off the north-east corner of Senate Square. Museums main exhibition moved to the University Main Building in 2015.

Helsinki University Museum was established in 2003 by merging the former University Museum specialising in the history of the University of Helsinki, the Museum of Medical History, the Museum of the History of Veterinary Medicine, the Museum of the History of Dentistry and the Collections of Craft Science. To complement the new conglomeration of museums, the Mineral Cabinet, which today belongs to the Finnish Museum of Natural History, returned to its original location in the Arppeanum building. Each year the museum also holds one or two temporary exhibitions in a specially designed area. Museums exhibition in Arppeanum Building was closed in June 2014. New main exhibition was opened in the Main Building in March 2015.

The University Museum is in charge of the preservation and conservation of the university’s valuable museum collections and property: old tuition and research equipment, furniture and works of art. The museum maintains an index register of all valuables that are kept in the facilities of the university. The museum also provides library, archive and photographic services pertaining to the history of the university and the history of medical science.

===Finnish Museum of Natural History===
[[File:Helsingin Luonnontieteellinen museo.JPG|thumb|200px|Museum of Natural History.|right]]
The [[Finnish Museum of Natural History]] is a research institution under the University of Helsinki. It is responsible for the national botanical, zoological, geological and paleontological collections consisting of samples from around the world. The collections serve scientific, public informational and educational purposes.

==Student life==

===Student Union===
[[File:Helsinki Old Student House.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Vanha Ylioppilastalo|The Old Student House]] (Student Union), Aleksanterinkatu.]]
The [[Student Union of the University of Helsinki]] (''Helsingin yliopiston ylioppilaskunta'', HYY) was founded in 1868. It currently has 32,000 members and is one of the world's wealthiest student organizations, with assets of several hundred million [[euro]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/25/business/worldbusiness/25iht-small.t.html |title=HYY of Helsinki Runs a $200 Million Enterprise : University Student Union Plays Business Tycoon |first=Barry |last=James |date=25 May 1998 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, it owns a good deal of property in the city centre of Helsinki. The union has been at the centre of student politics from the 19th Century nationalist movements, through the actions of the New Left in the 1960s, up to the present. Its governing assembly consists of parties which are connected to faculty organisations, the [[Nations at Finnish universities#Student nations at Helsinki University|Student Nations]], and the mainstream [[List of political parties in Finland|political parties]].

===Student nations===
The [[Nations in Finnish universities#Student nations at Helsinki University|student nations]] are student organisations that provide extra-curricular activities to students. Along with the faculty-based organisations, the nations provide one of the main nodes of student social life. The nations at University of Helsinki have a special legal status in the Universities Act. There are 15 nations at the university, each one representing a historic region or province of Finland, with four of these representing [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]] regions.  Membership is optional.

The '''wetted perimeter''' is the perimeter of the cross sectional area that is "wet".&lt;ref name="Knighton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knighton|first=David|title=Fluvial forms and processes: a new perspective|edition=2nd|publisher=Routledge|date=1998|isbn=978-0340663134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term wetted perimeter is common in [[Civil Engineering|civil engineering]], [[Environmental Engineering|environmental engineering]], [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology]], and [[heat transfer]] applications; it is associated with the [[hydraulic diameter]] or [[hydraulic radius]]. Engineers commonly cite the cross sectional area of a river.

The wetted perimeter can be defined mathematically as 
:&lt;math&gt;P = \sum_{i=0}^\infty{l_i}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''l&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the length of each surface in contact with the aqueous body.

In [[open channel flow]], the wetted perimeter is defined as the surface of the channel bottom and sides in direct contact with the aqueous body. [[Friction]] losses typically increase with an increasing wetted perimeter, resulting in a decrease in [[Hydraulic head|head]].&lt;ref name="Knighton" /&gt; In a practical experiment, one is able to measure the wetted perimeter with a tape measure weighted down to the river bed to get a more accurate [[measurement]].

When a channel is much wider than it is deep, the wetted perimeter approximates the channel width.&lt;ref name="Knighton" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16353">'''Words per minute''', commonly abbreviated '''wpm''' (sometimes uppercased '''WPM'''), is a measure of [[word]]s processed in a minute, often used as a measurement of the speed of typing, [[reading speed|reading]] or Morse code sending and receiving.

== Alphanumeric entry ==

Since the length or duration of words is clearly variable, for the purpose of measurement of text entry, the definition of each "word" is often standardized to be five characters or [[keystroke]]s long in English,&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Sabbir Arif and Wolfgang Stuerzlinger. 2009.[http://www.asarif.com/pub/papers/Arif_TICSTH09.pdf Analysis of Text Entry Performance Metrics]. In ''Proceedings of the IEEE Toronto International Conference–Science and Technology for Humanity'' (TIC-STH '09). IEEE, Washington, DC, US, 100-105.&lt;/ref&gt; including spaces and punctuation. For example, under such a method applied to plain English text the phrase "I run" counts as one word, but "rhinoceros" and "let's talk" would both count as two.

Brandon Raziano found that one study of average [[computer user]]s in 1997, the average rate for transcription was 33 words per minute, and 19 words per minute for composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |vauthors=Karat CM, Halverson C, Horn D, Karat J |year=1999 |title=Patterns of entry and correction in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems |booktitle=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '99) |publisher=ACM |location=New York, NY, US |pages=568–575 |doi=10.1145/302979.303160 |url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/302979.303160 |isbn=0-201-48559-1 |accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same study, when the group was divided into "fast", "moderate", and "slow" groups, the average speeds were 40 wpm, 35 wpm, and 23 wpm, respectively.&lt;ref name="Brown1988"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brown |first=CM |year=1988 |title=Human-computer interface design guidelines |location=Norwood, NJ |publisher=Ablex Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of the era of desktop computers, fast typing skills became much more widespread.

An average professional [[Copy typist|typist]] types usually in speeds of 50 to 80 wpm, while some positions can require 80 to 95 (usually the minimum required for dispatch positions and other time-sensitive typing jobs), and some advanced typists work at speeds above 120 wpm.&lt;ref name="Ayres&amp;Martinás2005"&gt;{{citation |year=2005 |author=Ayres, Robert U |authorlink=Robert Ayres (scientist) |author2=Martinás, Katalin |chapter=120 wpm for very skilled typist |page=41 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksxK7J95IF8C&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=typists+%22120+words+per+minute%22#v=onepage&amp;q=typists%20%22120%20words%20per%20minute%22&amp;f=false |title=On the Reappraisal of Microeconomics: Economic Growth and Change in a Material World |place=Cheltenham, UK &amp; Northampton, Massachusetts |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=1-84542-272-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksxK7J95IF8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=reappraisal+microeconomics#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-finger typists, sometimes also referred to as "[[hunt and peck]]" typists, commonly reach sustained speeds of about 37 wpm for memorized text and 27 wpm when copying text, but in bursts may be able to reach much higher speeds.&lt;ref name="Brown1988"/&gt; From the 1920s through the 1970s, typing speed (along with shorthand speed) was an important secretarial qualification and typing contests were popular and often publicized by typewriter companies as promotional tools.

== Stenotype ==
{{Main article|Stenotype}}

Stenotype keyboards enable the trained user to input text as fast as 225 wpm or faster at very high accuracy for an extended period of time, which is sufficient for real-time activities such as court reporting or closed captioning. While dropout rates are very high—in some cases, only 10%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american-school-search.com/review/stenotype-institute-of-jacksonville |title=Stenotype Institute of Jacksonville Jacksonville - Review &amp; Ranking |publisher=American-school-search.com |date=2014-04-13 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even less graduate—stenotype students are usually able to reach speeds of 100–120 wpm within six months, which is faster than most alphanumeric typists. Guinness World Records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/fastest-realtime-court-reporter-%28stenotype-writing%29/ |title=Fastest realtime court reporter (stenotype writing) |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |date=2004-07-30 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives 360 wpm with 97.23% accuracy as the highest achieved speed using a stenotype.

== Numeric entry ==

The numeric entry or 10 key speed is a measure of one's ability to manipulate the [[numeric keypad]] found on most modern separate computer keyboards. It is used to measure speed for jobs such as [[Data entry clerk|data entry]] of number information on items such as [[remittance advice]], bills, or checks, as deposited to [[lockbox]]es. It is measured in "Keystrokes per hour," or KPH. Many jobs require a certain KPH, often 8,000 or 10,000.

== Handwriting ==
&lt;!-- The average human being [[Penmanship|hand-writes]] at 31 words per minute for [[memory|memorized]] text and 19 words per minute while copying.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Brown, C. M. (1988). Human-computer interface design guidelines. Norwood, NJ: Ablex Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2016}}--&gt;

For an adult population (age range 18–64) the average speed of copying is 68 letters per minute (approximately 13 wpm), with the range from a minimum of 26 to a maximum of 113 letters per minute (approximately 5 to 20 wpm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bledsoe Jr.|first1=Dave|title=Handwriting Speed in an Adult Population|journal=Advance for Occupational Therapy Practitioners|date=2011|volume=27|issue=22|pages=10|url=http://occupational-therapy.advanceweb.com/Archives/Article-Archives/Handwriting-Speed-in-an-Adult-Population.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of police interview records showed that the highest speed fell in the range 120–155 characters per minute, the highest possible limit being 190 characters per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardcastle|first1=R. A.|last2=Matthews|first2=C. J.|title=Speed of writing|journal=Journal of the Forensic Science Society|date=January 1991|volume=31|issue=1|pages=21–29|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015736891731149|doi=10.1016/s0015-7368(91)73114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to various studies the speed of handwriting of 3–7 graders varies from 25 to 94 letters per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zaviani|first1=Jenny|last2=Wallen|first2=Margaret|editor1-last=Henderson|editor1-first=Anne|editor2-last=Pehoski|editor2-first=Charlane|title=Hand Function in the Child: Foundations for Remediation|date=2006|publisher=Mosby|location=St. Louis, MO|page=228|edition=2nd|chapter=The Development of Graphomotor Skills|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2g51sanc4AMC&amp;pg=PA228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[stenography]] (shorthand) methods, this rate increases greatly. Handwriting speeds up to 350 words per minute have been achieved in shorthand competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/12/30/102911691.pdf |title=New World'S Record For Shorthand Speed |publisher=New York Times |date=1922-12-30 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reading and comprehension ==
Words per minute is a common metric for assessing [[reading (activity)|reading]] speed and is often used in the context of remedial skills evaluation, as well as in the context of [[speed reading]], where it is a controversial measure of reading performance.

A word in this context is the same as in the context of speech&lt;!--, above--&gt;.

Research done in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trauzettel-Klosinski|first1=Susanne|last2=Dietz|first2=Klaus|title=Standardized Assessment of Reading Performance: The New International Reading Speed Texts IReST|journal=Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science|date=August 2012|volume=53|issue=9|url=http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2166061}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured the speed at which subjects read a text aloud, and found the average speed across 17 different languages to be 184±29 wpm or 863±234 characters per minute. However, for the languages that use the Latin or [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] alphabets, the number of wpm varied, as low as 161±18 for [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and as high as 228±30 for English. The reason for this is different word structures in each language (longer words in such languages as Finnish and shorter words in English). However, the number of characters per minute tends to be around 1000 for all the tested languages. For the tested Asian languages that use particular writing systems (Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese) these numbers are lower.

Scientific studies have demonstrated that reading—defined here as capturing and decoding all the words on every page—faster than 900 wpm is not feasible given the limits set by the anatomy of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0-9934964-0-0|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cEFKjwEACAAJ&amp;dq=ultimate+study+method&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[proofreading]] materials, people are able to read English at 200 wpm on paper, and 180 wpm on a monitor.&lt;ref name=Ziefle98&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ziefle|first1=M|title=Effects of display resolution on visual performance.|journal=Human factors|date=December 1998|volume=40|issue=4|pages=554–68|pmid=9974229|doi=10.1518/001872098779649355}}&lt;/ref&gt; [Those numbers from Ziefle, 1998, are for studies that used monitors prior to 1992. See Noyes &amp; Garland 2008 for a modern tech view of equivalence.]

== Speech and listening ==

[[Audiobook]]s are recommended to be 150–160 words per minute, which is the range that people comfortably hear and vocalize words.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. R. (1998). Guidelines for the use of multimedia in instruction, Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 42nd Annual Meeting, 1447–1451&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slideshow|Slide presentations]] tend to be closer to 100–125 wpm for a comfortable pace,&lt;ref name=wong&gt;{{cite book|last=Wong|first=Linda|title=Essential Study Skills|date=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1285965620|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yL2iAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA348&amp;dq=conversation+words+per+minute&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U6waU7ulFMbokQfiwYCoAg&amp;ved=0CDkQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=conversation%20words%20per%20minute&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[auctioneer]]s can speak at about 250 wpm,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} and the fastest speaking [[Policy debate#Speed|policy debaters]] speak from 350&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/19/magazine/319debate.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Ministers of Debate | first=Zev | last=Chafets | date=2006-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over 500 words per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9Jld9a4olgC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=540+words+per+minute |title=Falwell Inc.: Inside a Religious, Political, Educational, and Business Empire - Dirk Smillie - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet speech calculators show that various things influence words per minute including nervousness.{{Citation needed|reason=More information required to make this assertion|date=May 2014}}

[[John Moschitta, Jr.]], was listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', for a time, as the world's fastest speaker, being able to talk at 586 wpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyhistory.com/events/1988/may_24_1988_161209.html |title=John Moschitta set record for fast talking... May 24 in History |publisher=Brainyhistory.com |date=1988-05-24 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since been surpassed by [[Steve Woodmore]], who achieved a rate of 637 wpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4-CRv0ih28 |title=World's Fastest Talker - Steve Woodmore |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-05 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morse code ==

[[Morse code]] uses variable length sequences of short and long duration ''signals'' (dots and dashes) to represent source information&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Telecommunication Union|first1=ITU|title=International Morse Code Recommendation|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/m/R-REC-M.1677-1-200910-I!!PDF-E.pdf|publisher=ITU}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. sequences for the letter "K" and numeral "2" are respectively ({{morse|dash|dot|dash}}) and ({{morse|dot|dot|dash|dash|dash}}). This variability complicates the measurement of Morse code speed rated in words per minute. Using telegram messages, the average English word length is about five characters, each averaging 5.124 dot durations or baud. Spacing between words should also be considered, being seven dot durations in the USA and five in British territories. So the average British telegraph word was 30.67 dot times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morsh|first1=Joseph E.|last2=Stannard|first2=A. F. B.|title=Studies in international Morse Code. II. A simplified method of determining code speed.|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology Revue Canadienne de Psychologie|date=1947|volume=1|issue=2|pages=67–70|doi=10.1037/h0084027}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the baud rate of a Morse code is {{frac|50|60}} × word per minute rate.

It is standard practice to use two different such ''standard words'' to measure Morse code speeds in words per minute. The standard words are: "PARIS" and "CODEX". In Morse code "PARIS" has 50 dot durations, while "CODEX" has 60.

Morse is still widely used by [[amateur radio]] operators (hams).  Experienced hams routinely send Morse at 20 words per minute, using manually operated hand [[telegraph key]]s; enthusiasts such as members of [[The CW Operators' Club]] routinely send and receive Morse code at speeds up to 60 wpm. Twenty words per minute (20 wpm) represents the rough upper limit for Morse operators attempting to write down Morse code received by ear using paper and pencil.  Many skilled Morse code operators can receive Morse code by ear mentally without writing down the information at speeds up to 70 wpm.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} To write down the Morse code information manually at speeds higher than 20 wpm it is usual for the operators to use a typewriter or computer keyboard to enable higher speed copying.

The fastest Morse code operator was [[Theodore Roosevelt McElroy]] copying at 75.6 wpm using a typewriter at the 1939 world championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerwendell.com/morsecode.html |title=Morse code page of Roger J. Wendell - WBŘJNR (WB0JNR) |publisher=Rogerwendell.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
