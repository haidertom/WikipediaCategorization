{{Discrimination sidebar}}

'''Anti-intellectualism''' is hostility to and mistrust of [[intellect]], [[intellectual]]s, and [[intellectualism]] commonly expressed as deprecation of [[education]] and [[philosophy]], and the dismissal of [[art]], [[literature]], and [[science]] as impractical and even contemptible human pursuits.&lt;ref name="Literature 1980 p. 27"&gt;''A Handbook to Literature'' (1980), Fourth Edition, C. Hugh Holman, Ed. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-intellectuals present themselves and are perceived as champions of common folk—[[populists]] against political and [[academic elitism]]—and tend to see educated people as a [[status class]] detached from the concerns of most people, and feel that intellectuals dominate political discourse and control [[higher education]].&lt;ref name="Literature 1980 p. 27"/&gt;

[[Totalitarian]] governments manipulate and apply anti-intellectualism to repress [[political dissent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Black Book of Communism|last=Courtois|first=Stephanie|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=601}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939) and the following right-wing dictatorship (1939–1975) of General [[Francisco Franco]], the [[reactionary]] repression of the [[White Terror (Spain)|White Terror]] (1936–1945) was notably anti-intellectual, with most of the 200,000 civilians killed being the Spanish [[intelligentsia]], the politically active teachers and academics, artists and writers of the deposed [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931–1939).&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Wars'' (2007), Third Edition, pp. 517–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Communist]] state of [[Democratic Kampuchea]] (1975–1979), the [[Khmer Rouge]] régime of [[Pol Pot]] condemned most of the non-Communist intelligentsia to death in the [[Khmer Rouge Killing Fields|Killing Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woroni.com.au/articles/features/trial-khmer-rogue |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422004018/http://www.woroni.com.au/articles/features/trial-khmer-rogue |archivedate=2012-04-22 |title=Trial of the Khmer Rogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideological anti-intellectualism==
[[File:Blargos1.jpg|400px|thumb|In the "Night of the Long Batons" (29 July 1966), the federal police physically purged politically-incorrect academics, who opposed the right-wing military dictatorship of [[Juan Carlos Onganía]] (1966–70) in [[Argentina]], from five faculties of the University of Buenos Aires.]]
[[File:Flag of Democratic Kampuchea.svg|thumb|right|The cultural re-organization of Cambodian society, by the dictator [[Pol Pot]], created a government which tried to re-make its society anti-intellectual in what became known as [[Democratic Kampuchea]] (1975–1979), a de-industrialized, agricultural country.]]

In the 20th century, some societies have systematically removed intellectuals from power, sometimes assassinating them, to expediently end public political dissent. During the [[Cold War]] (1945–1991), the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] (1948–1990) ostracized the philosopher [[Václav Havel]] as a politically-unreliable man unworthy of ordinary Czechs' trust; the post-communist [[Velvet Revolution]] (17 Nov.–29 Dec. 1989) elected Havel president for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blisty.cz/video/Slavonic/havel.html|title=Václav Havel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the anti-communist Argentine [[military dictatorship]] of Gen. [[Juan Carlos Onganía]] (1966–70) intervened at the University of Buenos Aires with the [[La Noche de los Bastones Largos|Night of the Long Batons]] to physically dislodge politically-dangerous academics from five [[faculty (university)|university faculties]]. That expulsion to exile of the academic ''intelligentsia'' became a national [[brain drain]] upon the society and economy of Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcis.oise.utoronto.ca/~dschugurensky/assignment1/1966uba.html Police repression at the Universidad de Buenos Aires] - [[University of Toronto]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elortiba.org/blargos.html La noche de los bastones largos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514124954/http://www.elortiba.org/blargos.html |date=May 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of the military repression of free speech, biochemist [[César Milstein]] said, "Our country would be put in order, as soon as all the intellectuals who were meddling in the region were expelled." In Brazil, the government banished the educator [[Paulo Freire]] for being an ignorant man, said the organizers of the current ''coup d'état.''&lt;ref name="politicalaffairs1"&gt;[http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/4771/1/238 Political Affairs Magazine - Power and the Intellectuals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003056/http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/4771/1/238 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ideology|Ideologically]]-extreme dictatorships who mean to recreate a society, such as the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia]] (1975–79), pre-emptively killed potential political opponents, especially the educated middle-class and the ''intelligentsia''. To realize the [[Year Zero (political notion)|Year Zero]] of Cambodian history, Khmer Rouge [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] restructured the economy by de-industrialization, and assassinated non-communist Cambodians suspected of "involvement in free-market activities", such as the urban professionals of society (physicians, attorneys, engineers, ''et al.'') and people with political connections to foreign governments. The [[Maoism|Maoist]] doctrine of [[Pol Pot]] identified the farmers as the true [[proletariat]] of Cambodia and the true representatives of the [[working class]] entitled to hold government power, hence the anti-intellectual purges.

Anti-intellectualism is not always violent, because any social group can act anti-intellectually and discount the [[Humanism|humanist]] value to their society of [[intellect]], [[intellectualism]], and [[higher education]]. In Uruguay, the writer [[Jorge Majfud]] said that "this contempt, that arises from a power installed in the social institutions, and from the inferiority complex of its actors, is not a property of 'underdeveloped' countries. In fact, it is always the critical intellectuals, writers, or artists who head the top-ten lists of 'The Most Stupid of the Stupid' in the country."&lt;ref name="politicalaffairs1"/&gt;

==Academic anti-intellectualism==
===United States===
In ''The Campus Wars'' (1971), the philosopher [[John Searle]] said that "the two most salient traits of the radical movement are its anti-intellectualism and its hostility to the university as an institution. ... Intellectuals, by definition, are people who take ideas seriously for their own sake. Whether or not a theory is true or false is important to them, independently of any practical applications it may have. [Intellectuals] have, as Richard Hofstadter has pointed out, an attitude to ideas that is at once playful and pious. But, in the radical movement, the intellectual ideal of knowledge for its own sake is rejected. Knowledge is seen as valuable only as a basis for action, and it is not even very valuable there. Far more important than what one knows is how one feels."&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John R. (1971). [http://www.ditext.com/searle/campus/2.html The Campus Wars, Chapter 2: The Students], URL retrieved 14 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Social Sciences as Sorcery'' (1972), the sociologist [[Stanislav Andreski]] advised laymen to distrust the intellectuals' [[appeals to authority]] when they make questionable claims about resolving the problems of their society: "Do not be impressed by the imprint of a famous publishing house, or the volume of an author's publications. ... Remember that the publishers want to keep the printing presses busy, and do not object to nonsense if it can be sold."&lt;ref&gt;Stanislav Andreski, ''The Social Sciences as Sorcery''. 1972, The University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Science and Relativism: Some Key Controversies in the Philosophy of Science'' (1990), the epistemologist [[Larry Laudan]] said that the prevailing type of philosophy taught at university in the U.S. ([[Postmodernism]] and [[Poststructuralism]]) is anti-intellectual, because "the displacement of the idea that facts and evidence matter, by the idea that everything boils down to subjective interests and perspectives is — second only to American political campaigns  — the most prominent and pernicious manifestation of anti-intellectualism in our time."&lt;ref&gt;Larry Laudan, ''Science and Relativism: Some Key Controversies in the Philosophy of Science'' (1990), University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distrust of intellectuals===
In the U.S., the American conservative&lt;ref&gt;https://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/attheintersectionoffaithandculture/2011/08/black-and-conservative-a-look-at-thomas-sowell.html&lt;/ref&gt; economist [[Thomas Sowell]] argued for distinctions between unreasonable and reasonable wariness of intellectuals in their influence upon the institutions of a society. In defining intellectuals as "people whose occupations deal primarily with ideas", they are different from people whose work is the practical application of ideas. That cause for layman mistrust lies in the intellectuals' incompetence outside their fields of expertise. Although possessed of great working knowledge in their specialist fields, when compared to other professions and occupations, the intellectuals of a society face little discouragement against speaking authoritatively beyond their field of formal expertise, and thus are unlikely to face responsibility for the social and practical consequences of their errors. Hence, a physician is judged competent by the effective treatment of the sickness of a patient, yet might face a medical [[malpractice]] lawsuit should the treatment harm the patient. In contrast, a [[tenure]]d university professor is unlikely to be judged competent or incompetent by the effectiveness of his or her intellectualism (ideas), and thus not face responsibility for the social and practical consequences of the implementation of the ideas, e.g. the [[Chicago Boys]] and the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)]].

In the book ''[[Intellectuals and Society]]'' (2009), Sowell said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By encouraging, or even requiring, students to take stands where they have neither the knowledge nor the intellectual training to seriously examine complex issues, teachers promote the expression of unsubstantiated opinions, the venting of uninformed emotions, and the habit of acting on those opinions and emotions, while ignoring or dismissing opposing views, without having either the intellectual equipment or the personal experience to weigh one view against another in any serious way.&lt;ref name="Sowell2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|title=Intellectuals and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r601nMi73RQC|accessdate=16 November 2013|year=2009|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780465019489}}{{pages needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hence,  school teachers are part of the ''intelligentsia'' who recruit children in elementary school and teach them politics—to advocate for or to advocate against a public policy—as part of community-service projects; which political experience later assists them in earning admission to university. In that manner, the intellectuals of a society intervene and participate in social arenas of which they might not possess expert knowledge, and so unduly influence the formulation and realization of [[public policy]]. In the event, teaching political advocacy in elementary school encourages students to formulate opinions "without any intellectual training or prior knowledge of those issues, making constraints against falsity few or non-existent."&lt;ref&gt;Sowell (2009), p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the anti-intellectualism of the writer [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] derived from his close examination of twentieth-century history, which revealed to him that intellectuals have continually championed disastrous public policies for [[social welfare]] and [[public education]], and warned the layman public to "beware [the] intellectuals. Not merely should they be kept well away from the levers of power, they should also be objects of suspicion when they seek to offer collective advice."&lt;ref name="Johnson2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Paul|title=Intellectuals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTqHpZech0YC&amp;pg=PT1|accessdate=16 November 2013|date=2009-10-13|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780061871474}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that vein, "In the Land of the Rococo Marxists" (2000), the American writer [[Tom Wolfe]] characterized the intellectual as "a person knowledgeable in one field, who speaks out only in others."&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Tom. (2000). "In the Land of the Rococo Marxists", ''Harper's Monthly'', June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
[[File:JohnCotton.jpg|right|thumb|300px|In the book ''The Powring Out of the Seven Vials'' (1642), the Protestant minister [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]] equated education and intellectualism with atheist service to the supernatural.]]
In ''The Powring Out of the Seven Vials'' (1642), the Puritan [[John Cotton (puritan)|John Cotton]] demonized intellectual men and women by noting that "the more learned and witty you bee, the more fit to act for [[Satan]] will you bee. ... Take off the fond doting ... upon the learning of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], and the glorie of the Episcopacy, and the brave estates of the Prelates. I say bee not deceived by these pompes, empty shewes, and faire representations of goodly condition before the eyes of flesh and blood, bee not taken with the applause of these persons."&lt;ref name="Hofstadter, Richard 1962 p.46"&gt;Hofstadter, Richard ''Anti-intellectualism in American Life'' (1962), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, not every [[Puritan]] concurred with Cotton's religious contempt for [[Secularism|secular]] education, some, such as [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]], founded a university.

In ''The Quest for Cosmic Justice'' (2001), the economist Thomas Sowell said that anti-intellectualism in the U.S. began in the early Colonial era, as an understandable wariness of the educated upper-classes, because the country mostly was built by people who had fled political and religious persecution by the social system of the educated upper classes. Moreover, there were few intellectuals who possessed the practical hands-on skills required to survive in the New World of North America, which absence from society lead to a deep-rooted, [[Populism|populist]] suspicion of men and women who specialize in "verbal virtuosity", rather than tangible, measurable products and services:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From its colonial beginnings, American society was a "decapitated" society—largely lacking the top-most social layers of European society. The highest elites and the titled aristocracies had little reason to risk their lives crossing the Atlantic, and then face the perils of pioneering. Most of the white population of colonial America arrived as [[indentured servant]]s and the black population as [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]]. Later waves of immigrants were disproportionately [[peasant]]s and [[proletarian]]s, even when they came from Western Europe ... The rise of American society to pre-eminence, as an economic, political, and military power, was thus the triumph of the common man, and a slap across the face to the presumptions of the arrogant, whether an elite of blood or books.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas. (2001) ''The Quest for Cosmic Justice''. Simon and Schuster, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-7432-1507-7}}, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===19th century===
In U.S. history, the advocacy and acceptability of anti-intellectualism varied, because in the 19th century most people lived a [[rural]] life of [[manual labour]] and agricultural work, therefore, an academic education in the Græco–Roman classics, was perceived as of impractical value; the bookish man is unprofitable. Yet, in general, Americans were a [[literacy|literate]] people who read [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] for intellectual pleasure and the Christian Bible for emotional succor; thus, the ideal American Man was a literate and technically-skilled man who was successful in his [[trade]], ergo a productive member of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vinovskis|first=Maris|year=1992|title=Schooling and Poor Children in 19th-Century America|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=35|pages=313–331|via=|doi=10.1177/0002764292035003008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally, the ideal American was the self-made man whose knowledge derived from life-experience, not an intellectual man whose knowledge of the real world derived from books, formal education, and academic study; thus, the justified anti-intellectualism reported in ''The New Purchase, or Seven and a Half Years in the Far West'' (1843), the Rev. Bayard R. Hall, A.M., said about frontier Indiana:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We always preferred an ignorant, bad man to a talented one, and, hence, attempts were usually made to ruin the [[morality|moral]] character of a smart candidate; since, unhappily, [[Intellectual giftedness|smartness]] and wickedness were supposed to be generally coupled, and [like-wise] incompetence and goodness.&lt;ref name="Hofstadter, Richard 1962 p.46"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet, in the society of the U.S., the "real-life" redemption of the [[egghead]] intellectual was possible if he embraced the [[mores]] of mainstream society; thus, in the fiction of [[O. Henry]], a character noted that once an East Coast university graduate "gets over" his intellectual vanity—he no longer thinks himself better than other men—he makes just as good a [[cowboy]] as any other young man, despite his common-man counterpart being the slow-witted naïf of good heart, a pop culture [[stereotype]] from stage shows.

=== 20th/21st centuries ===
Political polarization in the U.S. favoured the use of anti-intellectualism by each political party (Republican and Democratic) to undermine the credibility of the other party with the [[middle class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/7-things-to-know-about-polarization-in-america/|title=7 Things to Know about Polarization in America|date=2014-06-12|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Anti-Intellectualism in American Life]]'' (1963) the historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] said that anti-intellectualism is a social-class response, by the middle-class "mob", against the privileges of the political élites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Intellectualism in American Life|last=Hofstadter|first=Richard|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1963|isbn=0394415353|location=United States of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the middle class developed political power, they exercised their belief that the ideal candidate to office was the "self-made man", not the well-educated man born to wealth. The self-made man, from the middle class,  could be trusted to act in the best interest of his fellow citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789-1815|last=Wood|first=Gordon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=0199832463}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Americans and Chinese: Passages to Differences'' (1980), Francis Hsu said that American [[egalitarianism]] is stronger in the U.S. than in Europe, e.g. in England,

&lt;blockquote&gt;English individualism developed hand in hand with legal equality. American self-reliance, on the other hand, has been inseparable from an insistence upon economic and social as well as political equality. The result is that a qualified individualism, with a qualified equality, has prevailed in England, but what has been considered the unalienable right of every American is unrestricted self-reliance and, at least ideally, unrestricted equality. The English, therefore, tend to respect class-based distinctions in birth, wealth, status, manners, and speech, while Americans resent them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Americans and Chinese: Passages to Differences|last=Hsu|first=Francis|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1980|isbn=082480757X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such social resentment characterises contemporary political discussions about the socio-political functions of mass-communication media and science; that is, scientific facts, generally accepted by educated people throughout the world, are misrepresented as opinions in the U.S., specifically about [[climate science]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/11/05/global-concern-about-climate-change-broad-support-for-limiting-emissions/|title=Global Concern about Climate Change, Broad Support for Limiting Emissions|last=Stokes|first=Bruce|last2=Wike|first2=Richard|date=2015-11-05|website=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2017-03-01|last3=Carle|first3=Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the New Jersey governor, Woodrow Wilson, described the battles of anti-intellectualism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What I fear is a government of experts. God forbid that, in a democratic country, we should resign the task and give the government over to experts. What are we for if we are to be scientifically taken care of by a small number of gentlemen who are the only men who understand the job?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction: The Tension between Science and Politics|last=Dreger|first=Jonas|publisher=Palgrave Macmillian UK|year=2014|isbn=978-1-349-47918-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Miami University anthropology professor H. Sidky has argued that 21st-century anti-scientific and pseudoscientific approaches to knowledge, particularly in the United States, are rooted in a postmodernist "decades-long academic assault on science:" "Many of those indoctrinated in postmodern anti-science went on to become conservative political and religious leaders, policymakers, journalists, journal editors, judges, lawyers, and members of city councils and school boards.

==== Corporate mass media ====
The reportage of corporate mass-communications media appealed to societal anti-intellectualism by misrepresenting university life in the U.S., where the students' pursuit of book learning (intellectualism) was secondary to the after-school social life. That the [[reactionary]] ideology communicated in mass-media reportage misrepresented the liberal political activism and social protest of students as frivolous, social activities thematically unrelated to the academic curriculum, which is the purpose of attending university.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Intellectualism in American Media|last=Dane|first=Claussen|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-8204-5721-3|location=New York|pages=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Anti-intellectualism in American Media'' (2004), Dane Clausen identified the contemporary anti-intellectualist bent of [[Manufacturing Consent|manufactured consent]] that is inherent to commodified information:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The effects of mass media on attitudes toward intellect are certainly multiple and ambiguous. On the one hand, mass communications greatly expand the sheer volume of information available for public consumption. On the other hand, much of this information comes pre-interpreted for easy digestion and laden with hidden assumption, saving consumers the work of having to [[Critical thinking|interpret it]] for themselves. Commodified information naturally tends to reflect the assumptions and interests of those who produce it, and its producers are not driven entirely by a passion to promote critical reflection.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Intellectualism in American Media|last=Dane|first=Claussen|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-8204-5721-3|location=New York|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rigney|first=Daniel|year=1991|title=Three kinds of Anti-intellectualism: Rethinking Hofstadter|url=|journal=Sociological Inquiry|volume=61|pages=431–451|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The editorial perspective of the corporate mass-media misrepresented intellectualism as a profession that is separate and apart from the jobs and occupations of regular folk. In presenting academically successful students as social failures, an undesirable social status for the average young man and young woman, corporate media established to the U.S. mainstream their opinion that the intellectualism of book-learning is a form of mental deviancy, thus, most people would shun intellectuals as friends, lest they risk social ridicule and ostracism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Intellectualism in American Media|last=Dane|first=Claussen|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-8204-5721-3|location=New York|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the popular acceptance of anti-intellectualism lead to populist rejection of the ''intelligentsia'' for resolving the problems of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claussen|first=Danes|year=|title=A Brief History of Anti-Intellectualism in American Media|url=|journal=Academe|volume=97|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the book ''Inventing the Egghead: The Battle over Brainpower in American Culture'' (2013), Aaron Lecklider indicated that the contemporary ideological dismissal of the ''intelligentsia'' derived from the corporate media's reactionary misrepresentations of intellectual men and women as lacking the common-sense of regular folk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inventing the Egghead: The Battle over Brainpower in American Culture|last=Lecklider|first=Aaron|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Confirmation bias====
In the field of psychology, [[confirmation bias]] is the mental phenomenon that confirms the validity of a person's self-accepted beliefs, [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, and [[Value system|values]], to create emotional hostility (anti-intellectualism) towards and mistrust of other beliefs, ideals, and value systems to which the anti-intellectual person has not been exposed; thus, confirmation bias is a symptom of anti-intellectualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/science-choice/201504/what-is-confirmation-bias|title=What Is Confirmation Bias?|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer [[Isaac Asimov]], speaking of this, said that "There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://progresoweekly.us/cult-ignorance-u-s-anti-intellectualism-dumbing-america/|title=The cult of ignorance in the U.S.: Anti intellectualism and the 'dumbing down' of America - Progreso Weekly|date=2016-05-29|work=Progreso Weekly|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Europe==

===Communism===
In the first decade after the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the [[Bolshevik]]s suspected the [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] [[intelligentsia]] as potentially traitorous of the [[proletariat]], thus, the initial [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government comprised men and women without much formal education.  Moreover, the deposed propertied classes were termed ''[[Lishentsy]]'' ("the disenfranchised"), whose children were excluded from education; eventually, some 200 Tsarist intellectuals such as writers, philosophers, scientists, and engineers were deported to Germany on [[Philosophers' ships]] in 1922; others were deported to [[Latvia]] and to [[Turkey]] in 1923.

During the [[revolution]]ary period, the pragmatic Bolsheviks employed "bourgeois experts" to manage the economy, industry, and agriculture, and so learn from them. After the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–22), to achieve socialism, the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] (1922–91) emphasised literacy and education in service to modernising the country via an educated [[working class]] [[intelligentsia]], rather than an [[Ivory Tower]] intelligentsia. During the 1930s and the 1950s, [[Joseph Stalin]] replaced Lenin's intelligentsia with a "communist" intelligentsia, loyal to him and with a specifically Soviet world view, thereby producing the [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] theories of [[Lysenkoism]] and [[Japhetic theory]].

===Fascism===
[[File:Giovanni Gentile.png|thumb|right|Active philosopher: [[Giovanni Gentile]], intellectual father of [[Italian Fascism]].]]

The [[Actual Idealism|idealist]] philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]] established the intellectual basis of [[Fascism|Fascist]] ideology with the ''autoctisi'' (self-realisation) via concrete thinking that distinguished between the good (active) intellectual and the bad (passive) intellectual:

{{quote|Fascism combats ... not intelligence, but intellectualism... which is... a sickness of the intellect... not a consequence of its abuse, because the intellect cannot be used too much... it derives from the false belief that one can segregate oneself from life.|Giovanni Gentile|addressing a Congress of Fascist Culture, Bologna, 30 March 1925}}

To counter the "passive intellectual" who used his or her intellect abstractly, and therefore was "decadent", he proposed the "concrete thinking" of the active intellectual who applied intellect as [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]—a "man of action", like Fascist [[Benito Mussolini]], versus the decadent [[Communism|Communist]] [[intellectual]] [[Antonio Gramsci]]. The passive intellectual stagnates intellect by objectifying ideas, thus establishing them as objects. Hence the [[Fascism|Fascist]] rejection of materialist [[logic]], because it relies upon ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles improperly counter-changed with ''a posteriori'' ones that are irrelevant to the matter-in-hand in deciding whether or not to act.

In the praxis of Gentile's concrete thinking criteria, such consideration of the ''a priori'' toward the properly ''a posteriori'' constitutes ''impractical'', decadent intellectualism. Moreover, this fascist philosophy occurred parallel to [[Actual Idealism]], his philosophic system; he opposed [[intellectualism]] for its being disconnected from the active intelligence that gets things done, i.e. thought is killed when its constituent parts are labelled, and thus rendered as discrete entities.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, Giovanni, ''Origins and Doctrine of Fascism (with selections from other works)'', A. James Gregor, ed., pp. 22–23, 33, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Guide to Philosophy'' (2005), Ted Honderich, ed., p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to this, is the confrontation between the Spanish [[Franquism|franquist]] General, [[José Millán Astray#Confrontation with Unamuno|Millán Astray]], and the writer [[Miguel de Unamuno]] during the ''[[Dia de la Raza]]'' celebration at the [[University of Salamanca]], in 1936, during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The General exclaimed: ''¡Muera la inteligencia! ¡Viva la Muerte!'' ("Death to intelligence! Long live death!"); the Falangists applauded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==In Asia==

===China===
====Imperial China====
[[Qin Shi Huang]] (246–210 BC), the first Emperor of unified China, consolidated political thought, and power, by suppressing [[freedom of speech]] at the suggestion of Chancellor [[Li Si]], who justified such anti-intellectualism by accusing the [[intelligentsia]] of falsely praising the emperor, and of dissenting through libel. From 213 to 206 BC, it was generally thought that the works of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] were incinerated, especially the ''Shi Jing'' ([[Classic of Poetry]], c. 1000 BC) and the ''Shujing'' ([[Classic of History]], c. 6th century BC). The exceptions were books by Qin historians, and books of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], an early type of [[totalitarianism]]—and the Chancellor's philosophic school (see the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars]]).
However, upon further inspection of Chinese historical annals such as the Shi Ji and the Han Shu, this was found not to be the case. The Qin Empire privately kept one copy of each of these books in the Imperial Library but it publicly ordered that the books should be banned. Those who owned copies were ordered to surrender the books to be burned; those who refused were executed.  This eventually led to the loss of most ancient works of literature and philosophy when [[Xiang Yu]] burned down the Qin palace in 208BC.

====People's Republic of China====

The [[Cultural Revolution]] was a politically violent decade (1966–76) of wide-ranging [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] by its leader Chairman [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]. After several national policy crises, Mao, to regain public prestige and control of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), on 16 May 1966, announced that the Party and Chinese society were permeated with liberal bourgeois elements who meant to restore [[capitalism]] to China, and that said people could only be removed with [[Aggravation of class struggle under socialism|post–revolutionary class struggle]]. To that effect, China's youth nationally organised into [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]], hunting the liberal bourgeois elements subverting the CCP and Chinese society. The Red Guards acted nationally, purging the country, the military, urban workers, and the leaders of the CCP. The Red Guards were particularly aggressive in attacking their teachers and professors, causing most schools and universities to be shut down once the Cultural Revolution began.  Three years later, in 1969, Mao declared the Cultural Revolution ended; yet the political intrigues continued until 1976, concluding with the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]], the ''de facto'' end of the Cultural Revolution.

===Democratic Kampuchea===
When the Communist Party of Cambodia, the [[Khmer Rouge]] (1951–81), established their regime as [[Democratic Kampuchea]] (1975–1979) in [[Cambodia]], their anti-intellectualism which idealised the country and demonised the cities was immediately imposed on the country in order to establish [[agrarian socialism]], thus, they emptied cities in order to purge the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] nation of every [[treason|traitor]], [[enemy of the state]], and [[intellectual]], often symbolised by eyeglasses (see the [[Killing Fields]]).

===Ottoman Empire===
[[File:April24Victims.jpg|thumbnail|Some of the Armenian intellectuals who were detained, deported, and killed in the Armenian Genocide of 1915]]
In the early stages of the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915, around 2,300 Armenian intellectuals were [[Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915|deported]] from Constantinople (Istanbul) and subsequently mostly murdered by the Ottoman government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dadrian|first=Vahakn N.|authorlink=Vahakn Dadrian|title=The history of the Armenian genocide: ethnic conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=1-57181-666-6|page=221|edition=6th rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event has been described by historians as a [[decapitation strike]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blinka|first=David S.|title=Re-creating Armenia: America and the memory of the Armenian genocide|date=2008|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|page=31|quote=In what scholars commonly refer to as the decapitation strike on April 24, 1915...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloxham|first1=Donald|authorlink1=Donald Bloxham|title=The Great Game of Genocide: Imperialism, Nationalism, and the Destruction of the Ottoman Armenians|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=70|quote=...the decapitation of the Armenian nation with the series of mass arrests that began on 24 April...}}&lt;/ref&gt; which intended to deprive the Armenian population of an intellectual leadership and a chance of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sahаkian|first=T.

In this context, the arts can include [[Performing arts education]] ([[dance]], [[drama]], [[music]]), [[literature]] and [[poetry]], [[storytelling]], [[Visual arts education]] in [[film]], [[craft]], [[design]], [[digital arts]], [[Mass media|media]] and [[photography]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Road Map for Arts Education, 2006 http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=30335&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Accessed 19/8/13&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from [[art education]] by being not so much about [[teaching]] art, but focused on:

* how to improve learning through the arts
* how to transfer learning in and through the arts to other disciplines
* discovering and creating understanding of human behavior, thinking, potential, and learning especially through the close observation of works of art and various forms of involvement in arts experiences

== Projects ==
The [[European Union]] has funded the ARTinED (a new approach to education using the arts) project to integrate the arts into every primary school subject ARTinED.

The [[European Commission]] has funded the ART4rom, a project based on the practice of the arts in school and non school environments. The aim of the project is to foster intercultural dialogue, mutual understanding and social inclusion for [[Romani people|Roma]] and non-Roma children aged between 5 and 10.

== Weaknesses ==

The various models of [[education theory]] are predicated on [[Pedagogy]] while almost entirely ignoring the fact that most [[art schools]] are directly involved in the teaching of adults. This blind spot means that the pedagological model of learning is unsuitable for institutions that are intended to focus on [[androgogy]] which is term used specifically in relation to the teaching of adult learners.

== Importance ==
"As the repression builds, art comes to be regarded as 'time off for good behaviour' or as 'therapy'" and how the ease and carefreeness of the arts are supposed to bring joy and a sense of calmness."&lt;ref&gt;Efland, A. (1976). The school art style: A functional analysis. Studies in art education, 37-44.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to destroy the monotony of a regular school day, put a dent in the relentlessness of arithmetic and reading. Art should be seen as means of therapy, never something made to cause unrelenting stress and difficulty. If a student becomes less tense and wired up from stress in their learning environments, then they will raise up their grades in other classes, such as maths, English, or science. To give off a relaxed vibe, putting art on the wall tends to provide a calming environment that produces a sense of peace and serenity. Arts-related activities are important for so much more than just keeping your child busy or relaxed. They’ve been proven to boost a child’s self-image. The self esteem, confidence and pride that comes from art in education is truly incredible and each child should be able to experience that. &lt;ref&gt;Efland, A. (1976). The school art style: A functional analysis. Studies in art education, 37-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In places like the United States, arts education is not as valued. However, some national reforms like the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) requires that arts education, visual and performing, be considered core subjects as they have been proven by many tests to work. Through these requirements schools gain the funds to implement subjects and supplementary items, like books and calculators, that students may need to be successful. Schools can also gain funds by participating in national and regional standardized tests, these tests however, only test students on their ability to perform high in subjects such as math, literacy, and science. Art courses aid student's ability to perform high in these subjects as they challenge a student's brain.{{cn|date=June 2016}} Tests like the [[Mozart effect]], the effect that learning and listening to classical music have on the brain, gives students the ability to learn, reduce stress, and positively change sleeping patterns more easily.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

Art programs within education has its importance in not only expanding the mind but keeping kids off the streets and out of the correctional system. Studies show{{cn|date=June 2016}} that students with art programs are three times more likely to graduate than those who don't. Art programs give kids somewhere to express themselves if they don't have the support to do that at home, it also gets kid to think creatively and inventively, expanding a kids way of thinking in general. Kids that had access to art programs or afterschool programs had better grades, it allowed them to improve their overall skills in school. All of these things are ways that kids keep from getting "bored" in school and getting in with the wrong crowd. Keeping art programs in schools is an important way to keep our kids safe and smart.{{cn|date=June 2016}}
Professor P Vijayakumar, Chairperson,Centre for Social and Organisational Leadership (C SOL) at Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai,India uses art as a teaching tool extensively in the Organisation Development and Change course for masters students states "Art facilitates reflection.

[[File:Van-Jones-graph.jpg|thumb|Van Jones - Why is art important?]]
 Van Jones presented a graph that accurately represents the interaction between the four aspects of society and its different members. Consequently, Jones depicts why art is important to our society. Society is driven by the powerful elites, the dependent masses, government, cultural producers and artists. On the left you have action, and on the right, ideas; elites are at the top, and the masses are below. There’s an inside act and an outside act. On the inside, there’s big money: elites are spending millions of dollars to influence politicians and policy makers. The inside act has the power to influence policy creators. On the outside, we at the grassroots set our expectations and needs, so that the elected candidates pass laws that give us power. Masses reflect what society really wants (heart) The left side, “action,” often means quantifiable policy changes. The right side, “ideas,” can be harder to see. We are not necessarily talking about concrete things here, but rather, a “head space.” Academic institutions and think tanks, which are not always involved in the immediate policy wins, are significant in creating a culture of thought. While the left side, “action”, continues to produce quantifiable policy changes and new laws, the right side “ïdeas”, can be hard to quantify its outcome. Although “head” talks theories and academics, it fails to produce any significant contribution to policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;https://theartist.me/art/what-is-art/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute''' (BDRI) is a research and educational centre dedicated to the understanding and conservation of cetaceans and the marine environment in which they live. The Institute's BDRI centre was founded by the biologist Bruno Díaz López in [[Sardinia]], Italy in 2005. In 2014, the BDRI opened a new facility in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Spain. 

BDRI concentrates its efforts on research into [[dolphins]] because they are predators at the top of their [[food chain]], so their well-being provides an excellent indication of the health of the entire [[ecosystem]] on which they, and humans, depend. Whales and dolphins around the world are under threat from [[marine pollution]], [[over-fishing]], getting entangled in nets, [[whaling]] and uncontrolled tourism.

The BDRI is intended to contribute to the understanding and conservation of dolphins, expand the public's knowledge and concern for the marine environment, and add to the knowledge base of bottlenose dolphins through publications of collected and analysed field data. Using study techniques that neither harm nor seriously disturb the animals, the BRDI is currently engaged in the conduction of a long-term study about the ecology and behaviour of a bottlenose dolphin population, as well as collecting detailed information about their environment.

The BDRI has educational and research programmes aimed at providing extra support for scientists early in their careers, science students, local students and scientists from developing countries, including training
opportunities in the field, grants, and online and field courses.

==Significance of BDRI research projects==

Cetacean populations are affected by man's use of coastal waters, particularly by fisheries activities and habitat modification. BDRI research projects provide scientific data to assist environmental agencies in managing and conserving marine natural resources and to obtain fundamental knowledge about this behaviourally flexible and cosmopolitan species. Their programs are conducted under a Research Permit issued by the Department of Environment of the Galician Government as part of our cooperation with the national networking for the study of marine mammals (CEMMA).
Additional studies by the BDRI have also been conducted in Italy, Spain and Abu Dhabi to date.

===Previous and current BDRI research projects===

BDRI researchers address a wide range of questions to form a multi-dimensional picture of the marine mammals behaviour and ecology and its relationship to the rest of the planet, including human society. The BDRI research has a multidisciplinary approach where we currently focus on four main research projects:
 
- Cetacean distribution along Galician coast: Current studies by the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute BDRI research team principally focus on the cetacean species frequenting the inshore waters of the outer Arousa Firth, however, a new area like Galician coastal waters (north-west Spain) offers us to also take on new projects and a more diverse range of issues and species. These waters are characterized by high biodiversity and productive fisheries, supported by nutrient input due to upwelling. Twenty species of cetaceans have been recorded in Galician waters, of which the most abundant appear to be short-beaked common dolphins and bottlenose dolphins. Other species present in the area include harbour porpoises, Risso’s dolphins and long-finned pilot whale. Conservation issues for cetaceans in Galician waters include interactions with fisheries, which may be a significant cause of mortality, overfishing, and oil spills. Hence, the information collected will inform conservation plans by identifying coastal areas of high importance to cetaceans. Wild bottlenose dolphins and humans frequenting the same small areas makes boat interaction more or less inevitable. BDRI researchers provided quantified data about bottlenose dolphin diving behaviour in the presence and absence of boats in Galicia. The data reported by BDRI researchers could be used to implement precautionary management proposals that take into account the potential effects of boat presence on dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz Lopez, B., Shirai, J.A.; Bilbao Prieto, A. &amp; Méndez Fernández, P., 2008. "Diving activity of a solitary wild free ranging bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)". ''Journal of Marine Biological Association'' U.K.88(6): 1153-1157.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernal Shirai, J. A., Diaz Lopez, B., Méndez Fernández, P., Bilbao Prieto, A. &amp; Díaz da Silva, J.I., 2006. "Analysis of diving behaviour of a solitary male bottlenose dolphin in the inshore waters of Galicia (Spain)" 20th Annual Conference of the European Cetacean Society ECS 2006 - Gdynia, Polonia.&lt;/ref&gt;

- Behavioural ecology of dolphins and impact of human activities on their lives: Much of the research work is based upon repeat observations of individually-recognisable dolphins, providing data for a range of long-term and ongoing studies on the abundance, site fidelity, home range, social structure and behaviour of this population. The study of dolphins social structures defines an important class of ecological relationships between individuals and their nearby conspecifics. Common bottlenose dolphins live in fission–fusion societies within which individuals associate in small groups that change in composition, often on a daily or hourly basis. Fission–fusion societies limit the effect of within-unit competition through unit splits during periods of high competition, and they enhance cooperative effects through unit cohesion when the ecological costs of aggregating are low or benefits of sociality are high. Human activities can influence the distribution of food resources, which may promote the evolution of social organizations as a response to fluctuations in the costs of feeding competition. Therefore, fission–fusion societies present a good opportunity to examine the costs and benefits of association in dolphin populations affected by human use of coastal waters, especially by fisheries activities and habitat modification.
 
Individual-based studies focusing explicitly the variability of social unit structure in relation to anthropogenic factors are few. In this project, BDRI researchers will study the patterns of association of different populations of bottlenose dolphins (in Italy and Spain) and will describe the way in which their association behaviour is related to the way they respond to food patches created by human activities. BDRI researchers studied interactions between dolphins and [[gillnets]] along the north-eastern coast of Sardinia (Italy). Although dolphins benefit from taking fish entangled in gillnets, the association with gillnets is harmful because it exposes dolphins to additional risk. An observed annual estimate of the number of dolphins caught in gillnets was 3.54%. The extent of the estimated [[by-catch]] is worrisome in terms of the ability of bottlenose dolphins off Sardinia to sustain such an annual loss. The higher annual numbers of immature dolphins than adults dolphins caught in gillnets was related with a lack of experience together with and the tendency of immatures to play and/or to spend a lot of time scouting.&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez et al 2013"&gt;Diaz Lopez B., Addis A., Fabiano, F., 2013.

BDRI's researchers have also examined the effects of aquaculture on marine fauna in general, and more specifically, the impacts of aquaculture on dolphins in different marine fin fish farms off the coast of Sardinia, Italy. One of the objectives of these studies was to determine the variables that influence the presence and abundance of dolphins in the fish farms area.&lt;ref name="Fortuna M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortuna M 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2012"&gt;Díaz López B. , 2012.

Marine [[aquaculture]] and, in particular intensive fish farming, have shown a large expansion in most Mediterranean countries over the last ten years. To curb predation, many marine fish farms employ control methods which exclude, harass or remove predators. One such method, predator netting, creates a physical barrier that protects farmed fish from attacks by airborne and underwater predators. The incidental capture of [[marine mammals]] by commercial fisheries is often a controversial and emotive issue. A potential impact on marine mammals as a result of aquaculture interaction is death or injury through entanglement in gear. BDRI researchers carried out the first attempt in the Mediterranean basin to obtain information on encounter rate, group size and incidental capture of bottlenose dolphins in a marine fish farm. The regular occurrence of some dolphins suggests individual preferences for the fish farm area. The incidental bottlenose dolphin capture observed in large, loose predator nets is cause for concern, as it is questionable whether or not the bottlenose dolphins in the area can sustain incidental capture of this magnitude. The information gained from this study showed the necessity for further regulations to be established, both in the use of predator nets and management of marine fish farms.&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortuna M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortuna M 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez B 2008"&gt;Diaz Lopez B. and Shirai, J.A., 2008.

Assessing the consequences of fisheries and habitat modification with relatively obvious effects on marine predators can be difficult. BDRI researchers were the first to show how coastal fisheries and aquaculture are not only directly affecting marine predators but could also indirectly affect their social structure and behaviour. BDRI researchers suggest that the main management issues raised by their studies relates to the dolphins' habitat. The feeding opportunities for dolphins that are created by human activities have become part of their "way of life", part of their habitat requirements. When top predators display complex social responses to activities not directed at them, the task of studying all possible effects in the food chain can become even more challenging. Further work should focus on elucidating how human activities induce social and spatial changes in marine top predators.&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez B 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diaz Lopez B., Bunke, M. and Shirai, J.A., 2008.

BDRI researchers observed that the use of [[Underwater locator beacon|pinger]]s reduces dolphin mortality due to bycatch on gillnets. Definite proof that acoustic devices have a long-term effectiveness has not been found. The Dinner Bell and Habituation factors must be taken into consideration to test in future studies.&lt;ref&gt;Troncone, R., Diaz Lopez, B., Shirai, J.A.B., 2008.

Bottlenose dolphins living around coastal regions have received much attention due to their increased vulnerability of inhabiting areas where marine traffic is concentrated. [[Marine traffic]] has previously been observed to elicit responses in [[cetacean]] behaviours, but the cause and effects of these interactions has yet to be fully understood. BDRI's current study area of Aranci Bay, Sardinia, provides a unique insight into an area where the interactions of bottlenose dolphins and vessels remains largely unchecked. Our studies showed that the dolphins were surfacing less regularly in the presence of vessels and this response was further enhanced during vessel approaches. Moreover, by examining the influence of different types of vessel it was evident that the dolphins elicited a stronger response to tourist than fisheries vessels. The behaviour vessels display around the dolphins as well as speed, engine type and distance of approach were all factors that needed to be taken into consideration when analysing the changes observed. Research is contributing to a wider management scheme to ensure that marine traffic is monitored effectively when bottlenose dolphins are present.&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, K., Diaz Lopez, B., and Shirai, J.A., 2007.

- Dolphins communication: [[Bioacoustics]] research provides important insights into animal behavior. Dolphins (family: Delphinidae) are an extremely vocal mammalian family and vocal communication plays an important role in mediating social interactions. Most BDRI studies of delphinid vocalizations have concentrated on bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus (in the Mediterranean, Italy, and in the Atlantic Ocean, Spain) and T. aduncus (in the [[Persian Gulf]], Abu Dhabi, UAE). Until recently, communication behaviour had a limited role in conservation, being restricted to enhancing captive breeding programs or use in species counts. However, knowledge of how individuals within a population communicate can generate information ranging from measures of habitat use, social relevance, geographical variation, cultural transmission, etc., that can be applied to conservation. Marine mammals use sound for activities essential to survival and reproduction. Bottlenose dolphins are extremely vocal mammalian species, and vocal communication plays an important role in mediating social interactions. Amid the abundant literature pertaining to vocalizations of bottlenose dolphins, very little is known about the vocal repertoire of Mediterranean wild bottlenose dolphins. BDRI bioacoustical studies carried out year round from 2005 represent the first attempt to obtain information on the repertoire and production patterns of bottlenose dolphins resident in an area characterized by important interaction with human activities (tourism, aquaculture and coastal fisheries). Many vocal signals were strongly implicated in social and feeding interactions. Although many of these vocalizations have been previously described in the literature, their association with specific behaviours linked with human activities provides additional contextual information about their potential use as communication signals. One of BDRI's most recent projects shows that the number of whistles recorded in a group increased significantly as the number of mother-calf pairs increased, confirming that whistles may be used as contact calls. These studies use benign techniques to demonstrate the great diversity of communication signals emitted and indicate a functional role of these vocalizations during the observed behaviours.&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2008"&gt;Diaz Lopez, B and Shirai, J.A., 2008. "Whistles characteristics and repertoire of wild bottlenose dolphins in Sardinia Island, Italy". RIMMO 16 ème Conférence Internationale sur les Cétacés en Méditerranée, Nice France, 15 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2011"&gt;Díaz López B., 2011. "Whistle characteristics in free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Mediterranean Sea: influence of behaviour". Mammalian Biology 76: 180-189.&lt;/ref&gt; Cetaceans (dolphins, whales and porpoises) are often faced with the challenge of hearing strange sounds in environments with noise from both natural and anthropogenic sources. BDRI researchers have documented that human-introduced noise induces behavioural reactions in bottlenose dolphins. In addition noise pollution is being considered as a cause of displacement of cetaceans from preferred habitats. Short-term noise pollution may not create significant problems. Repeated or long-term noise pollution, however, can cause stress and debilitation and may be related to dolphin mortality. Related scientific publications:&lt;ref name="Diaz Lopez 2008"/&gt;

- Dolphins in the [[Persian Gulf]]: At least ten species of cetacean have been identified in the Persian Gulf, but most of these are considered vagrant or seasonal visitor. Only two species of dolphin, the Indo-Pacific humpback (Sousa chinensis) and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) are thought to be common residents of the Gulf. The finless porpoise (Neophocoena phocaenoides) is thought to be an uncommon resident.

The conservation status of these species in Abu-Dhabi waters is totally unknown, largely because of the lack of research on either species. The world conservation status of these species is Data Deficient, that is, there is insufficient information on which to make an assessment. This deficiency hampers conservation and management efforts and our ability to assess the impact of human activities on local populations of this species.

BDRI researchers participate in cooperation with the Environmental Agency of Abu Dhabi since 2014, for the first time in Abu Dhabi waters, in a research project in order to obtain accurate data on population estimate, distribution, potential threats and residence patterns of dolphin species observed in coastal waters of Abu-Dhabi (UAE). The final purpose of this project is to inform and improve the design of conservation and management interventions towards these species in Abu-Dhabi waters.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz López B, and Methion S, 2015.

Every year new tropical species are catalogued in north Sardinia as having arrived from tropical waters as an effect of global warming, and entire ecosystems are being affected. BDRI researchers are committed to the implementation of proactive measures to help protect and sustain the local and global environment for future generations. The BDRI aims to achieve the objective of improved environmental performance through pollution prevention and continuous improvement. All BDRI members, workers and volunteers are expected to conduct their work in a manner compatible with the BDRI's Responsible Travel policy and objectives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4186">'''Casa Viva''' is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Wheaton, Illinois]] and [[San Jose, Costa Rica]]. Casa Viva seeks to place children who have been separated from their families into a safe, caring family. Casa Viva is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for “Living Families” or “Living Homes.” The model of international child care that Casa Viva has created:
*Doesn’t rely on ongoing American funding
*Is nationally based
*Uses the social network of [[Christian]] churches to identify and train families
Casa Viva primarily cares for [[social orphan]]s, and also cares for true [[orphans]].

==Casa Viva’s History==
In 1998 Philip and Jill Aspegren moved to the [[Dominican Republic]] to build an orphanage and train nationals to care for the children there with [[Kids Alive]]. But there had to be a better way: a less expensive, less institutional, quicker way to care for children internationally. They began to dream of a childcare model that does not require new buildings and that places children in families rather than in homes.

Moving to [[Costa Rica]] in 2005 they began to network with local churches, recruiting families belonging to those churches to care for children. Children who have been separated from their biological families are placed in families on a short term basis while their family is identified and counseled. Children are also placed in Casa Viva homes long term when it is impossible for the child to be reunited with their biological family. Children placed in a Casa Viva home have the advantage of growing up in a home that is surrounded by [[extended family]], [[local church]], and the support of the Casa Viva center.

==Casa Viva Today==
There are currently two Casa Viva Communities in [[Costa Rica]] - one in Eastern San Jose and a second in Grecia. In partnership with the Viva Network and Toybox it has identified [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Mexico]] and [[Paraguay]] as the next sites of multiplication.

===Developing Family Based Child Care International===
====Alternative to Orphanages====
Orphanages, whether private or government run, are institutions that are expensive to run and the good ones often become inundated with children sent there by the authorities. This reduces the quality of care and leaves the institution and its staff overworked and under equipped. While the physical needs of the child are met, often psychological needs of a child, the privacy of a child, and integration into their home culture are found to be lacking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/resources/last_res.pdf Save The Children: A Last Resort] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907101844/http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/resources/last_res.pdf |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led Casa Viva to begin creating a program, similar to England and the United States' [[foster care]] model, but with two primary differences:
*Church based
*Little financial incentive
In some cases, the financial benefit of already-established government-based fostering has become a primary motivator for families to be host foster families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingtheveil.org/foster07.htm Lifting the Veil on Foster Care]&lt;/ref&gt; Casa Viva does help families cover the cost of caring for the child but relies heavily on Biblical motivation and mandates to care for the orphan in need.

====Children Raised in Families====
It has been shown that children raised in orphanages do not develop as well physically, cognitively or emotionally as children raised in family based settings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_4_38/ai_n15338080 The House, The Street, Global Society: Latin American families and childhood in the twenty-first century]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23283">'''Category utility''' is a measure of "category goodness" defined in {{Harvtxt|Gluck|Corter|1985}} and {{Harvtxt|Corter|Gluck|1992}}. It attempts to maximize both the probability that two objects in the same category have attribute values in common, and the probability that objects from different categories have different attribute values. It was intended to supersede more limited measures of category goodness such as "[[cue validity]]" ({{Harvnb|Reed|1972}}; {{Harvnb|Rosch|Mervis|1975}}) and "collocation index" {{Harv|Jones|1983}}. It provides a normative [[information-theoretic]] measure of the ''predictive advantage'' gained by the observer who possesses knowledge of the given category structure (i.e., the class labels of instances) over the observer who does ''not'' possess knowledge of the category structure.  In this sense the motivation for the ''category utility'' measure is similar to the [[Information gain in decision trees|information gain]] metric used in [[decision tree]] learning. In certain presentations, it is also formally equivalent to the [[mutual information]], as discussed below.  A review of ''category utility'' in its probabilistic incarnation, with applications to [[machine learning]], is provided in {{Harvtxt|Witten|Frank|2005|pp=260–262}}.

==Probability-theoretic definition of Category Utility==
The [[probability-theoretic]] definition of ''category utility'' given in {{Harvtxt|Fisher|1987}} and {{Harvtxt|Witten|Frank|2005}} is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
CU(C,F) = \tfrac{1}{p} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(c_j) \left [\sum_{f_i \in F} \sum_{k=1}^m p(f_{ik}|c_j)^2 - \sum_{f_i \in F} \sum_{k=1}^m p(f_{ik})^2\right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F = \{f_i\}, \ i=1 \ldots n&lt;/math&gt; is a size-&lt;math&gt;n\ &lt;/math&gt; set of &lt;math&gt;m\ &lt;/math&gt;-ary  features, and &lt;math&gt;C = \{c_j\} \ j=1 \ldots p&lt;/math&gt; is a set of &lt;math&gt;p\ &lt;/math&gt; categories.  The term  &lt;math&gt;p(f_{ik})\ &lt;/math&gt; designates the [[marginal probability]] that feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; takes on value &lt;math&gt;k\ &lt;/math&gt;, and the term  &lt;math&gt;p(f_{ik}|c_j)\ &lt;/math&gt; designates the category-[[conditional probability]] that feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; takes on value &lt;math&gt;k\ &lt;/math&gt; ''given'' that the object in question belongs to category &lt;math&gt;c_j\ &lt;/math&gt;.

The motivation and development of this expression for ''category utility'', and the role of the multiplicand &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \tfrac{1}{p}&lt;/math&gt; as a crude overfitting control, is given in the above sources.  Loosely {{Harv|Fisher|1987}}, the term &lt;math&gt;\textstyle  p(c_j) \sum_{f_i \in F} \sum_{k=1}^m p(f_{ik}|c_j)^2&lt;/math&gt; is  the expected number of attribute values that can be correctly guessed by an observer using a [[probability-matching]] strategy together with knowledge of the category labels, while &lt;math&gt;\textstyle p(c_j) \sum_{f_i \in F} \sum_{k=1}^m p(f_{ik})^2&lt;/math&gt; is the expected number of attribute values that can be correctly guessed by an observer the same strategy but without any knowledge of the category labels.  Their difference therefore reflects the relative advantage accruing to the observer by having knowledge of the category structure.

== Information-theoretic definition of the Category Utility ==
The [[information-theoretic]] definition of ''category utility''  for a set of entities with size-&lt;math&gt;n\ &lt;/math&gt; binary feature set  &lt;math&gt;F = \{f_i\}, \ i=1 \ldots n&lt;/math&gt;,  and a binary category  &lt;math&gt;C = \{c,\bar{c}\}&lt;/math&gt; is given in {{Harvtxt|Gluck|Corter|1985}} as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
CU(C,F) = \left [p(c) \sum_{i=1}^n p(f_i|c)\log p(f_i|c) + p(\bar{c}) \sum_{i=1}^n p(f_i|\bar{c})\log p(f_i|\bar{c}) \right ] - \sum_{i=1}^n p(f_i)\log p(f_i)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p(c)\ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[prior probability]] of an entity belonging to the positive category &lt;math&gt;c\ &lt;/math&gt; (in the absence of any feature information), &lt;math&gt;p(f_i|c)\ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[conditional probability]] of an entity having feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; given that the entity belongs to category &lt;math&gt;c\ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p(f_i|\bar{c})&lt;/math&gt; is likewise the conditional probability of an entity having feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; given that the entity belongs to category &lt;math&gt;\bar{c}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;p(f_i)\ &lt;/math&gt; is the prior probability of an entity possessing feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; (in the absence of any category information).

The intuition behind the above expression is as follows: The term  &lt;math&gt;p(c)\textstyle  \sum_{i=1}^n p(f_i|c)\log p(f_i|c)&lt;/math&gt; represents the cost (in bits) of optimally encoding (or transmitting) feature information when it known that the objects to be described belong to category &lt;math&gt;c\ &lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, the term  &lt;math&gt;p(\bar{c})\textstyle  \sum_{i=1}^n p(f_i|\bar{c})\log p(f_i|\bar{c})&lt;/math&gt; represents the cost (in bits) of optimally encoding (or transmitting) feature information when it known that the objects to be described belong to  category &lt;math&gt;\bar{c}&lt;/math&gt;.  The sum of these two terms in the brackets is therefore the [[weighted average]] of these two costs.  The  final term, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle  \sum_{i=1}^n p(f_i)\log p(f_i)&lt;/math&gt;, represents the cost (in bits) of optimally encoding (or transmitting) feature information when no category information is available.  The value of the ''category utility'' will, in the above formulation, be negative (???).

=== Category Utility and Mutual Information ===
It is mentioned in {{Harvtxt|Gluck|Corter|1985}} and {{Harvtxt|Corter|Gluck|1992}} that the category utility is equivalent to the [[mutual information]].  Here we provide a simple demonstration of the nature of this equivalence.  Let us assume a set of entities each having the same &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;  features, i.e.,  feature set &lt;math&gt;F = \{f_i\}, \ i=1 \ldots n&lt;/math&gt;, with each feature variable having cardinality  &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. That is, each feature has the capacity to adopt any of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; distinct values (which need ''not'' be ordered; all variables can be nominal); for the special case &lt;math&gt;m=2&lt;/math&gt; these features would be considered ''binary'', but more generally, for any &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, the features are simply ''m-ary''.  For our purposes, without loss of generality, we can replace feature set &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with a single aggregate variable &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt; that has cardinality &lt;math&gt;m^n&lt;/math&gt;, and adopts a unique value &lt;math&gt;v_i, \ i=1 \ldots m^n&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to each feature combination in the [[Cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;\otimes F&lt;/math&gt;.  (Ordinality does ''not'' matter, because the mutual information is not sensitive to ordinality.)  In what follows, a term such as &lt;math&gt;p(F_a=v_i)&lt;/math&gt; or simply &lt;math&gt;p(v_i)&lt;/math&gt; refers to the [[probability]] with which &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt; adopts the particular value &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;.  (Using the aggregate feature variable &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt; replaces multiple summations, and simplifies the presentation to follow.)

We assume also a single category  variable &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, which has cardinality &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. This is equivalent to a classification system in which there are &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; non-intersecting categories.  In the special case of &lt;math&gt;p=2&lt;/math&gt; we have the two-category case discussed above.  From the definition of [[mutual information]] for discrete variables, the mutual information &lt;math&gt;I(F_a;C)&lt;/math&gt; between the aggregate feature variable &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt; and the category variable &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; 
I(F_a;C) = \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i,c_j) \log \frac{p(v_i,c_j)}{p(v_i)\,p(c_j)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p(v_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[prior probability]] of feature variable &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt; adopting value &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p(c_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[marginal probability]] of category variable &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; adopting value &lt;math&gt;c_j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;p(v_i,c_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[joint probability]] of variables &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; simultaneously adopting those respective values.  In terms of the conditional probabilities this can be re-written (or defined) as

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
I(F_a;C) &amp; = \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i,c_j) \log \frac{p(v_i|c_j)}{p(v_i)} \\
   &amp; = \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i|c_j)p(c_j) \left [\log p(v_i|c_j)- \log p(v_i) \right ] \\
   &amp; = \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i|c_j)p(c_j) \log p(v_i|c_j)- \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i|c_j)p(c_j) \log p(v_i) \\
   &amp; = \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i|c_j)p(c_j) \log p(v_i|c_j)- \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i,c_j) \log p(v_i) \\
   &amp; = \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i|c_j)p(c_j) \log p(v_i|c_j)- \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \log p(v_i) \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i,c_j)  \\
   &amp; = \sum_{v_i \in F_a} \sum_{c_j \in C} p(v_i|c_j)p(c_j) \log p(v_i|c_j)- \sum_{v_i \in F_a} p(v_i) \log p(v_i)   \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If we will rewrite the original [[Category utility#Definition of the Category Utility|definition of the category utility]] from above, with &lt;math&gt;C = \{c,\bar{c}\}&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;
CU(C,F) = \sum_{f_i \in F} \sum_{c_j \in C}   p(f_i|c_j) p(c_j) \log p(f_i|c_j) - \sum_{f_i \in F} p(f_i) \log p(f_i)
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation clearly has the same '''form''' as the (&lt;span style=color:blue;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;) equation expressing the mutual information between the feature set and the category variable; the difference is that the sum &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{f_i \in F}&lt;/math&gt; in the ''category utility'' equation  runs over independent binary variables &lt;math&gt;F = \{f_i\}, \ i=1 \ldots n&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the sum &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{v_i \in F_a}&lt;/math&gt; in the mutual information runs over ''values'' of the single &lt;math&gt;m^n&lt;/math&gt;-ary variable &lt;math&gt;F_a&lt;/math&gt;.  The two measures are actually equivalent then ''only'' when the features &lt;math&gt;\{f_i\}&lt;/math&gt;, are ''independent'' (and assuming that terms in the sum corresponding to &lt;math&gt;p(\bar{f_i})&lt;/math&gt; are also added).

== Insensitivity of category utility to ordinality ==
Like the [[mutual information]], the ''category utility'' is not sensitive to any ''ordering'' in the feature or category variable values.  That is, as far as the ''category utility'' is concerned, the category set &lt;code&gt;{small,medium,large,jumbo}&lt;/code&gt; is not qualitatively different from the category set &lt;code&gt;{desk,fish,tree,mop}&lt;/code&gt; since the formulation of the ''category utility'' does not account for any ordering of the class variable.  Similarly, a feature variable adopting values &lt;code&gt;{1,2,3,4,5}&lt;/code&gt; is not qualitatively different from a feature variable adopting values &lt;code&gt;{fred,joe,bob,sue,elaine}&lt;/code&gt;.  As far as the ''category utility'' or  ''mutual information'' are concerned, ''all'' category and feature variables are ''nominal variables.''  For this reason, ''category utility'' does not reflect any ''[[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]]'' aspects of "category goodness" that might be based on such ordering effects.  One possible adjustment for this insensitivity to ordinality is given by the weighting scheme described in the article for [[mutual information]].

== Category "goodness": Models and Philosophy==
This section provides some background on the origins of, and need for, formal measures of "category goodness" such as the ''category utility'', and some of the history that lead to the development of this particular metric.

===What makes a good category?===
At least since the time of [[Aristotle]] there has been a tremendous fascination in philosophy with the nature of [[concept]]s and [[universals]].  What kind of ''entity'' is a concept such as "horse"?  Such abstractions do not designate any particular individual in the world, and yet we can scarcely imagine being able to comprehend the world without their use.  Does the concept "horse" therefore have an independent existence outside of the mind?  If it does, then what is the locus of this independent existence?  The question of locus was an important  issue on which the classical schools of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] famously differed.  However, they remained  in agreement that universals  ''did'' indeed have a mind-independent existence. There was, therefore, always a ''fact to the matter'' about which concepts and universals exist in the world.

In the late [[Middle Ages]] (perhaps beginning with [[William of Ockham|Occam]], although [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] also makes a much earlier remark indicating a certain discomfort with the status quo), however, the certainty that existed on this issue  began to erode, and it became acceptable among the so-called [[nominalists]] and [[empiricists]] to consider concepts and universals as strictly mental entities or conventions of language.  On this view of concepts—that they are purely representational constructs—a new question then comes to the fore: ''Why do we possess one set of concepts rather than another?''  What makes one set of concepts "good" and another set of concepts "bad"?  This is a question that modern philosophers, and subsequently [[machine learning]] theorists and cognitive scientists, have struggled with for many decades.

===What purpose do concepts serve?===
One approach to answering such questions is to investigate the "role" or "purpose" of concepts in cognition.  Thus, we ask: ''What are concepts good for in the first place?''  The answer provided by {{Harvtxt|Mill|1843/1936|p=425}} and many others is that classification (conception) is a precursor to ''[[Inductive reasoning|induction]]'':   By imposing a particular categorization on the universe, an organism gains the ability to deal with physically non-identical objects or situations in an identical fashion, thereby gaining substantial predictive leverage  ({{Harvnb|Smith|Medin|1981}};{{Harvnb|Harnad|2005}}). As [[J.S. Mill]] puts it {{Harv|Mill|1843/1936|pp=466–468}},

{{quotation|The general problem of classification... [is] to provide that things shall be thought of in such groups, and those groups in such an order, as will best conduce to the remembrance and to the ascertainment of their laws... [and] one of the uses of such a classification that by drawing attention to the properties on which it is founded, and which, if the classification be good, are marks of many others, it facilitates the discovery of those others.}}

From this base, [[J.S. Mill|Mill]] reaches the following conclusion, which foreshadows much subsequent thinking about category goodness, including the notion of ''category utility'':

{{quotation|The ends of scientific classification are best answered when the objects are formed into groups respecting which a greater number of general propositions can be made, and those propositions more important, than could be made respecting any other groups into which the same things could be distributed. The properties, therefore, according to which objects are classified should, if possible, be those which are causes of many other properties; or, at any rate, which are sure marks of them.}}

One may compare this to the "category utility hypothesis" proposed by {{Harvtxt|Corter|Gluck|1992}}: "A category is useful to the extent that it can be expected to improve the ability of a person to accurately predict the features of instances of that category."   Mill here seems to be suggesting that the best category structure is one in which object features (properties) are maximally informative about the object's class, and, simultaneously, the object class is maximally informative about the object's features.  In other words, a useful classification scheme is one in which we can use category knowledge to accurately infer object properties, and we can use property knowledge to accurately infer object classes.  One may also compare this idea to [[Aristotle]]'s criterion of ''counter-predication'' for definitional predicates, as well as to the notion of concepts described in [[formal concept analysis]].

===Attempts at formalization===
A variety of different measures have been suggested with an aim of formally capturing this notion of "category goodness,"  the best known of which is probably the "[[cue validity]]". Cue validity of a feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; with respect to category &lt;math&gt;c_j\ &lt;/math&gt; is defined as the conditional probability of the category given the feature ({{Harvnb|Reed|1972}};{{Harvnb|Rosch|Mervis|1975}};{{Harvnb|Rosch|1978}}), &lt;math&gt;p(c_j|f_i)\ &lt;/math&gt;, or as the deviation of the conditional probability from the category base rate ({{Harvnb|Edgell|1993}};{{Harvnb|Kruschke|Johansen|1999}}), &lt;math&gt;p(c_j|f_i)-p(c_j)\ &lt;/math&gt;. Clearly, these measures quantify only inference from feature to category (i.e., ''cue validity''), but not from category to feature, i.e., the ''category validity'' &lt;math&gt;p(f_i|c_j)\ &lt;/math&gt;.  Also, while the cue validity was originally intended to account for the demonstrable appearance of ''[[basic categories]]'' in human cognition—categories of a particular level of generality that are evidently preferred by human learners—a number of major flaws in the cue validity quickly emerged in this regard ({{Harvnb|Jones|1983}};{{Harvnb|Murphy|1982}};{{Harvnb|Corter|Gluck|1992}}, and others).

One attempt to address both problems by simultaneously maximizing both feature validity and category validity was made by {{Harvtxt|Jones|1983}} in defining the "collocation index" as the product &lt;math&gt;p(c_j|f_i) p(f_i|c_j)\ &lt;/math&gt;, but this construction was  fairly ''ad hoc'' (see {{Harvnb|Corter|Gluck|1992}}).  The ''category utility'' was introduced as a more sophisticated  refinement of the cue validity, which attempts to more rigorously quantify the full inferential power of a class structure.  As shown above, on a certain view the category utility  is equivalent  to the [[mutual information]] between the feature variable and the category variable. It has been suggested that categories having the greatest overall  ''category utility'' are those that are not only those "best" in a normative sense, but also those human learners prefer to use, e.g., "basic" categories {{Harv|Corter|Gluck|1992}}.  Other related measures of category goodness are "cohesion" ({{Harvnb|Hanson|Bauer|1989}};{{Harvnb|Gennari|Langley|Fisher|1989}}) and "salience" {{Harv|Gennari|1989}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7223">In music, a '''coda''' {{IPA-it|ˈkoːda|}} ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "tail", plural ''code'') is a [[passage (music)|passage]] that brings a piece (or a [[movement (music)|movement]]) to an end. Technically, it is an expanded [[cadence (music)|cadence]].  It may be as simple as a few [[bar (music)|measures]], or as complex as an entire [[section (music)|section]].&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2009). ''Music in Theory and Practice: Volume II'', p.355. Eighth Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-310188-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Coda (''It.'') (1) The tail of a note. (2) The bars occasionally added to a contrapuntal movement after the close or finish of the ''[[canto fermo]]''. (3) The few chords or bars attached to an infinite canon in order to render it finite; or a few chords ''not in a canon'', added to a finite canon for the sake of obtaining a more harmonious conclusion. (4) That closing adjunct of any movement, or piece, specially intended to enforce a feeling of completeness and finality.&lt;ref&gt;Stainer, John and Barrett, William Alexander (1898). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K2H0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=%22coda%22+stainer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV4v-wvt3UAhUD9GMKHTFVBU4Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22coda%22%20stainer&amp;f=false Stainer and Barrett's Dictionary of Musical Terms]'', p.&amp;nbsp;100. Novello.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In classical music==

[[Image:Mozart- Coda- Sonata in C Major, K. 309, I.png|thumb|right|350px|Coda from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] [[Piano Sonata No. 7 (Mozart)|Piano Sonata no. 7 in C Major]], [[Koechel|K.]] 309, I, mm. 152–155 {{audio|Mozart- Coda- Sonata in C Major, K. 309, I.mid|Play}}.&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2009), p.151.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The presence of a coda as a structural element in a movement is especially clear in works written in particular [[musical form]]s.  Codas were commonly used in both [[sonata form]] and [[Variation (music)|variation]] movements during the Classical era.  In a sonata form movement, the [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] section will, in general, follow the [[exposition (music)|exposition]] in its thematic content, while adhering to the home [[key (music)|key]].  The recapitulation often ends with a passage that sounds like a termination, paralleling the music that ended the exposition; thus, any music coming after this termination will be perceived as extra material, i.e., as a coda.  In works in variation form, the coda occurs following the last variation and will be very noticeable as the first music not based on the theme.

One of the ways that [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] extended and intensified Classical practice was to expand the coda sections, producing a final section sometimes of equal musical weight to the foregoing exposition, development, and recapitulation sections and completing the [[musical argument]].  For one famous example, see the finale of [[Symphony No. 8 (Beethoven)]].&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of this coda, and of codas in general, see Rosen, Charles (1988) ''Sonata Forms'', 2nd edition.  New York:  Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2012}}

===Musical purpose===
[[Charles Burkhart]] suggests that the reason codas are common, even necessary, is that, in the climax of the main body of a piece, a "particularly effortful passage", often an expanded [[phrase (music)|phrase]], is often created by "working an idea through to its structural conclusions" and that, after all this momentum is created, a coda is required to "look back" on the main body, allow listeners to "take it all in", and "create a sense of balance."&lt;ref&gt;Burkhart, Charles. "The Phrase Rhythm of Chopin's A-flat Major Mazurka, Op. 59, No. 2" in Stein, Deborah (2005). ''Engaging Music: Essays in Music Analysis'', p.12. New York: [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-517010-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Codetta===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Piano Sonata No. 16 (Mozart)]] --&gt;
'''Codetta''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "little tail", the [[diminutive]] form) has a similar purpose to the coda, but on a smaller scale, concluding a section of a work instead of the work as a whole. A typical codetta concludes the [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] and [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] sections of a work in [[sonata form]], following the second ([[modulation (music)|modulated]]) theme, or the closing theme (if there is one). Thus, in the exposition, it usually appears in the secondary key, but, in the recapitulation, in the primary key. The codetta ordinarily closes with a [[perfect cadence]] in the appropriate key, confirming the tonality. If the exposition is repeated, the codetta is also, but sometimes it has its ending slightly changed, depending on whether it leads back to the exposition or into the [[musical development|development]] sections.

==History==
'''Cauda''', a Latin word meaning "tail", "edge" or "trail" is the root of ''coda'' and is used in the study of [[conductus]] of the 12th and 13th centuries. The cauda was a long [[melisma]] on one of the last syllables of the text, repeated in each strophe. Conducti were traditionally divided into two groups, ''conductus cum cauda'' and ''conductus sine cauda'' ([[Latin]]: "conductus with cauda", "conductus without cauda"), based on the presence of the melisma. Thus, the cauda provided a conclusionary role, also similar to the modern coda.

==In popular music==
Many songs in [[Rock music|rock]] and other genres of [[popular music]] have sections identifiable as codas.  A coda in these genres is sometimes referred to as an "[[Conclusion (music)|outro]]", while in jazz, modern church music and [[barbershop arranging]] it is commonly called a "tag". One of the most famous codas is found in the 1968 single "[[Hey Jude]]" by [[The Beatles]]. The coda lasted nearly four minutes, making the song's full length at just over the seven-minute mark, and the single topped the U.S. [[Billboard charts|Billboard chart]] for nine weeks, tying it for the longest run at the top of the chart.

==In music notation==
[[Image:Coda sign.svg|right|thumb|75px|Coda sign]]

In [[music notation]], the '''coda symbol''', which resembles a set of crosshairs, is used as a navigation marker, similar to the ''[[dal segno]]'' sign. It is used where the exit from a repeated section is within that section rather than at the end. The instruction "To Coda" indicates that, upon reaching that point during the final repetition, the performer is to jump immediately to the separate section headed with the coda symbol. For example, this can be used to provide a special ending for the final verse of a song.

The ''coda'' sign is encoded in the Musical Symbols block of Unicode as U+1D10C MUSICAL SYMBOL CODA:&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D100.pdf PDF of Musical Symbols block from the unicode consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;#x1D10C;

The '''Crespi effect''' is a [[Behavioral contrast|behavioural contrast]] phenomenon first observed in rats by US [[psychologist]] [[Leo P. Crespi]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crespi|first=Leo P.|date=1942|title=Quantitative Variation of Incentive and Performance in the White Rat|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1417120|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|volume=55|issue=4|pages=467–517|doi=10.2307/1417120}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that in a repeatedly carried out task such as finding food in a maze, the running speed of the rat is proportional to the size of the reward it obtained on the previous trial. The more food reward that was given to it last time upon completion of the task, the faster it will run when attempting to complete the same task. The effect also works in reverse: when rats were shifted from a larger to a smaller reward, they ran more slowly than the control rats that had always received the small reward.

It is important to note that the size of the reward has little or no influence on the speed of [[learning]], but that it does have an influence on the performance of tasks already learned.

A '''cum shot''' is the depiction of human [[ejaculation]], especially onto another person. The term ''cum shot'' is usually applied to depictions occurring in [[pornographic film]]s, photographs, and [[pornographic magazine|magazines]]. Cum shots have become the object of [[sexual fetishism|fetish]] genres like [[Bukkake (sex act)|bukkake]]. [[Facial (sex act)|Facial cum shots]] (or "facials") are currently regularly portrayed in pornographic films and videos, often as a way to close a scene.&lt;ref&gt;[[Violet Blue (author)|Violet Blue]], (Sep 2001) [http://www.tinynibbles.com/firstpr0n A First Timer’s Guide to Watching Porn], "Facial ejaculation (men ejaculating on women’s faces) is pretty much a standard."&lt;/ref&gt; Cum shots may also depict ejaculation onto another performer's body, such as on the genitals, buttocks, chest or tongue.

The term is typically used by the [[cinematographer]] within the narrative framework of a pornographic film, and, since the 1970s, it has become a [[leitmotif]] of the [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] genre. Two exceptions are [[softcore pornography]], in which penetration is not explicitly shown, and "couples erotica", which may involve penetration but is typically filmed in a more discreet manner intended to be romantic or educational rather than graphic. Softcore pornography that does not contain ejaculation sequences is produced both to respond to a demand by some consumers for less-explicit pornographic material and to comply with government regulations or cable company rules that may disallow depictions of ejaculation. Cum shots typically do not appear in "[[Lesbianism in erotica|girl-girl]]" scenes ([[female ejaculation]] scenes exist, but are relatively rare); orgasm is instead implied by utterances, cinematic conventions, or body movement.

==Terminology==
A cum shot may also be called a ''cumshot'', ''come shot'',&lt;ref name=Bal&gt;{{Cite book|title=Narrative Theory: Political narratology|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|author=Mieke Bal|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ys9xdkc01QAC&amp;lpg=PA298&amp;dq=cum%20shot&amp;pg=PA297|isbn=0-415-31660-X|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fatal Advice: How Safe-Sex Education Went Wrong|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|author=Cindy Patton |year=1996|url=http://www.questiaschool.com/read/1067656|isbn=|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''cum blast'', ''pop shot'' or ''[[money shot]]''.

Originally, in general film-making usage the term ''money shot'' was a reference to the scene that cost the most money to produce;&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;Jane Mills, ''The Money Shot: Cinema, Sin and Censorship''. Pluto Press, Annandale 2001. {{ISBN|1-86403-142-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=65HbQfMKmAIC&amp;pg=PR19 p. xix];  [http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/01/17/money_shot_intro.html Extract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225134157/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/01/17/money_shot_intro.html |date=2010-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, the inclusion of this expensive special effect sequence is being counted on to become a selling point for the film. For example, in an action thriller, an expensive special effects sequence of a dam bursting might be called the "money shot" of the film. The use of ''money shot'' to denote the ejaculation scene in pornographic films is attributed to producers paying the male actors extra for it.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Williams|authorlink=Linda Williams (film scholar)|title=Hard core: power, pleasure, and the "frenzy of the visible"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMa96WrLnhQC&amp;pg=PA93|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06652-6|pages=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the term ''money shot'' has sometimes been borrowed back from pornography by the film and TV industry with a meaning closer to that used in pornographic films. For example, in TV [[talk show]]s, the term, borrowed from pornography, denotes a highly emotional scene, expressed in visible bodily terms.&lt;ref name="Grindstaff2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Grindstaff|title=The money shot: trash, class, and the making of TV talk shows|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5pyLV0KM0wEC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-30911-8|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and features==
[[File:Rossetti-golden head.jpg|thumb|180px|Illustration for [[Christina Rossetti]]'s ''Goblin Market and Other Poems'' (1862), by her brother [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]].]]

Facials were described in literature predating the modern age of pornography. In the metaphor-laden 19th century poem ''[[Goblin Market]]'', villainous goblins try to cajole a young woman to eat their forbidden, alluring fruits and attendant juices:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Rossetti |author-first=Christina |title=Goblin Market and Other Poems |others=With art by D.G. Rossetti. |edition=2nd |publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co. |publication-place=London and Cambridge |publication-date=1865 |chapter=Goblin Market |page=23 |url=https://archive.org/stream/goblinmarketand00rossgoog#page/n39/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|Lizzie uttered not a word;
Would not open lip from lip
Lest they should cram a mouthful in:
But laughed in heart to feel the drip
Of juice that syrupped all her face,
And lodged in dimples of her chin,
And streaked her neck which quaked like curd.}}

The [[Marquis de Sade]] wrote about performing facials in his work ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'', written in 1785; one passage of the novel reads: "I show them my prick, then what do you suppose I do? I squirt the fuck in their face . . . That's my passion my child, I have no other . . . and you're about to behold it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seaver |first=Richard |title=The 120 Days of Sodom and Other Writings |publisher=Grove Press |page=268 |isbn=978-0-8021-3012-9 |year = 1987 |origyear=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other published examples can be found in the private letters of [[James Joyce]]&lt;ref&gt;Letter from James Joyce to Nora Barnacle, December 6, 1909 ''in'' Selected Letters of James Joyce 184 (Richard Ellmann, ed. 2003) ("At such moments I feel mad to do it in some filthy way, to feel your hot lecherous lips sucking away at me, to fuck between your two rosy-tipped bubbies, to come on your face and squirt it over your hot cheeks and eyes, to stick it between the cheeks of your rump and bugger you.").&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Hite Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Hite |author-first=Shere |title=The Hite Report on Female Sexuality |publisher=Dell |year=1981 |orig-year=1976 |page=376 |quote='He doesn't go down on me during my period like I wish he would. I love his sperm. I love to swallow it and rub it on my face, my breasts. I wish that he found my blood as beautiful and delicious.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although earlier pornographic films occasionally contained footage of ejaculation, it was not until the advent of [[hard-core pornography]] in the 1970s that the stereotypical cum shot scene became a standard feature—displaying ejaculation with maximum visibility.&lt;ref name="Williams1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aydemir2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Murat Aydemir|title=Images of bliss: ejaculation, masculinity, meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_MkshgDS6WgC&amp;pg=PA95|year=2007|publisher=Univ. of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-4867-2|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An oft quoted influential work of this era, Steven Ziplow's ''The Film Maker's Guide to Pornography'' (1977), states:

{{quote|There are those who believe that the come shot, or, as some refer to it, the "money shot," is the most important element in the movie and that everything else (if necessary) should be sacrificed at its expense. Of course, this depends on the outlook of the producer, but the one thing is for sure: if you don't have the come shots, you don't have a porno picture.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams1989"/&gt;}}

Cum shot scenes may involve the female actor calling for the shot to be directed at some specific part of her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Williams|title=Hard core: power, pleasure, and the "frenzy of the visible"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMa96WrLnhQC&amp;pg=PA101|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06652-6|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural analysis]] researcher Murat Aydemir&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/m.aydemir/ |title=dhr. dr.

As a possible alternative explanation for the rise of the cum shot in hardcore pornography, Joseph Slade, professor at [[Ohio University]]&lt;ref name="Ohio University Faculty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcomschool.ohiou.edu/faculty/slade.html |title=Ohio University Faculty |accessdate=2008-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628132623/http://www.tcomschool.ohiou.edu/faculty/slade.html |archivedate=2008-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and author of ''Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide'' notes that pornography actresses in the 1960s and 1970s did not trust birth control methods, and that more than one actress of the period told him that ejaculation inside her body was deemed inconsiderate if not rude.&lt;ref name=slade&gt;{{Cite book| last = Slade  | first = Joseph W.  | title = Pornography and Sexual Representation: A Reference Guide Vol. 2   | publisher = [[Greenwood Press]]  | pages=654–656  | isbn = 0-313-31520-5  | year = 2001 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaGTZySRzeYC&amp;pg=PA654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health risks==

===Transmission of disease===
Any sexual activity that involves contact with the [[bodily fluids]] of another person contains the risk of transmission of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.&lt;ref name="Em &amp; Lo's"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaJcLwgS9NkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=9780811852128&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3-o4UvTZIIq88wSH-YDIBg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=9780811852128&amp;f=false |title=Em &amp; Lo's Rec Sex: An A-Z Guide to Hooking Up |year=2006 |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=978-0-8118-5212-8 |last=Taylor |first1=Emma |last2=Sharkey |first2=Lorelei |page=60 |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semen is in itself generally harmless on the skin or if swallowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Thaddeus | title = Male Reproductive Function and Semen | publisher = Springer | pages = | isbn = 978-0-387-10383-9 | year = 1981 | origyear = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Scheit | first = Karl H. | title = Proteins of Seminal Plasma | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | pages = | isbn = 978-0-471-84685-7 | year = 1990 | origyear = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, semen can be the vehicle for many sexually transmitted infections, such as [[HIV]] and [[hepatitis]]. The [[California Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] categorizes semen as "other potentially infectious material" or OPIM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dir.ca.gov/DOSH/AdultFilmIndustry.html#hh |title = Cal/OSHA Health Hazards in the Adult Film Industry |accessdate=2008-07-25 |publisher=State of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from other sexual activity that may have occurred prior to performing a facial the risks incurred by the giving and receiving partner are drastically different. For the ejaculating partner there is almost no risk of contracting an STD. For the receiving partner, the risk is higher.&lt;ref name = Moore/&gt; Since potentially infected semen could come into contact with broken skin or sensitive [[mucous membrane]]s (eyes, lips, mouth), there is a risk of contracting an infectious disease.

===Allergic reactions===
In rare cases, people have been known to experience [[allergic reaction]]s to seminal fluids, known as human seminal plasma [[hypersensitivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Guillet G, Dagregorio G, Guillet M | title = [Vulvar contact dermatitis due to seminal allergy: 3 cases] | journal = Ann Dermatol Venereol | volume = 132 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15798560 | doi=10.1016/S0151-9638(05)79221-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms can be either localized or systemic, and may include itching, redness, swelling, or blisters within 30 minutes of contact. They may also include [[hives]] and even difficulty breathing.

Options for prevention of semen allergy include avoiding exposure to seminal fluid by use of condoms and attempting [[desensitization (medicine)|desensitization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Weidinger S, Ring J, Köhn F | title = IgE-mediated allergy against human seminal plasma | journal = Chem Immunol Allergy | volume = 88 | issue = | pages = 128–138 | year = 2005| pmid = 16129942 | doi = 10.1159/000087830| series = Chemical Immunology and Allergy, 2005| isbn = 3-8055-7951-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Treatment options include [[diphenhydramine]] and/or an injection of [[epinephrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/drugs/condition-3387-Allergic+Reactions.aspx |title=Common Drugs and Medications to Treat Allergic Reactions |publisher=Webmd.com |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms and responses==

===Criticisms===
There are a variety of views ranging from facials being an act of degradation and elicit humiliation to being grounded in mutual respect and elicit pleasure.&lt;ref name="Hess 2009-08-24"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hess |first=Amanda|title=Semen Facials Are Like Weddings|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/sexist/2009/08/24/semen-facials-are-like-weddings/|work=[[Washington City Paper]]|date=2009-08-24|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sex therapist]] [[Ruth Westheimer]] believes facials are humiliating and not sexy. She advises the average person contemplating oral sex to not think that a facial is a necessary
part of the act.&lt;ref name="Sex for Dummies"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex for Dummies|year=2006|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-04523-7|last1= Westheimer|first1=Ruth K.|last2=Lehu|first2=Pierre A.|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to an inquiry from a reader, [[sex columnist]] [[Dan Savage]] wrote: "Facials are degrading—and that's why they're so hot."&lt;ref name="Savage 2009-04-09"&gt;{{cite web|last=Savage|first=Dan|title=Savage Love|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=1220590|work=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]|date=2009-04-09|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daily Nexus]] columnist Nina Love Anthony views the practice of facials in a non-threatening light, feeling that it adds variety to the sexual experience. In one of her weekly articles she wrote "But let's give credit where credit is due: The money shot, by itself, is great for a number of reasons. Blowing it on someone's face is like a change-up pitch—if you've been throwing the heat for a while, maybe you should consider hooking the curve ball." She continues with "Also, being on the receiving end of the shot can satisfy the secret porn star in everyone and it's minor kink for beginners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailynexus.com/2005-11-09/ejaculate-maturely/|title=Ejaculate Maturely: A Little Man Cream Never Went This Far|publisher=Daily Nexus |accessdate=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist]] views of the depiction of male-on-female facials are primarily critical. [[Sociology|Sociologists]] [[Gail Dines]], Robert Jensen and Russo echo these sentiments in the book ''Pornography: The Production and Consumption of Inequality'' it asserts "In pornography, ejaculating onto a woman is a primary method by which she is turned into a [[slut]], something (not really someone) whose primary, if not only, purpose is to be sexual with men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dines | first = G |author2=Jensen R |author3=Russo A | title = Pornography: The Production and Consumption of Inequality | publisher = Routledge | pages= [https://books.google.ca/books?id=0i7dw9CwUe4C&amp;pg=PA78 78] | isbn = 978-0-415-91812-1 | year = 1998 | origyear = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical feminist and noted critic of pornography [[Andrea Dworkin]] said "it is a convention of pornography that the sperm is on her not in her. It marks the spot, what he owns and how he owns it. The ejaculation on her is a way of saying (through showing) that she is contaminated with his dirt; that she is dirty."&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

In Padraig McGrath's review of Laurence O'Toole's book ''Pornocopia – Porn, Sex, Technology and Desire'', he rhetorically asks whether "...women enjoy having men ejaculate on their faces?" He suggests that the role of such a scene is to illustrate that "...it doesn’t matter what the woman likes – she’ll like whatever the man wants her to like because she has no inner life of her own, in turn because she’s not a real person". McGrath argues that there is a "power-aspect" to depictions such as cum shots. He suggests that the "...central theme [of pornography] is power...[,] implicitly violent...eroticized hatred."&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.threemonkeysonline.com/review_pornocopia_laurence_otoole_review.htm |title=Pornocopia – Porn, Sex, Technology and Desire - by Laurence O'Toole|author=Padraig McGrath |publisher=Three Monkeys Online|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611070220/http://www.threemonkeysonline.com/review_pornocopia_laurence_otoole_review.htm|archivedate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gail Dines, writing in ''Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality'', describes the money shot of a man ejaculating on the face or body of a woman as "one of the most degrading acts in porn".&lt;ref name="Dines2010xxiv"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gail Dines|title=Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZOjb8Sk1bUC&amp;pg=PR26|accessdate=18 February 2011|date=1 July 2010|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-4452-0|page=xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Dines, the ejaculate on the female performer's body "marks the woman as used goods", conveying a sense of ownership, and she quotes veteran porn actor and producer [[Bill Margold]] as saying, "I'd like to really show what I believe the men want to see: violence against women. I firmly believe that we serve a purpose by showing that. The most violent we can get is the cum shot in the face. Men get off behind that because they get even with the women they can't have."&lt;ref name="Dines2010xxiv" /&gt; She adds that at least for some posters on adult forums discussing such scenes, the pleasure is derived from watching a woman suffer.&lt;ref name="Dines2010xxiv" /&gt;

Another critic of "cum shot" scenes in heterosexual pornography is the US porn star-turned writer, director and producer [[Candida Royalle]]. She produced pornography films aimed at women and their partners that avoid the "misogynous predictability" and depiction of sex in "...as grotesque and graphic [a way] as possible." Royalle also criticizes the male-centredness of the typical pornography film, in which scenes end when the male actor ejaculates.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/06/15/1087244912619.html Girls on top]" by Lilly Bragge, ''[[The Age]]'', June 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses===
Author [[Lisa Moore (writer)|Lisa Moore]] suggests that Dworkin's explanation does not take into account that it is the pleasure the actresses exhibit that the male partners enjoy, and that it is more accurate to think men want their semen to be wanted.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Moore | first = LJ | title = Sperm Counts: Overcome by Man's Most Precious Fluid | publisher = [[New York University Press]] | pages= [https://books.google.ca/books?id=tpiyGxq92RwC&amp;pg=PA84 84] | isbn = 978-0-8147-5718-5 | year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's activist [[Beatrice Faust]] argued, "since ejaculating into blank space is not much fun, ejaculating over a person who responds with enjoyment sustains a lighthearted mood as well as a degree of realism. This occurs in both homosexual and {{sic|hetrosexual}} pornography so that ejaculation cannot be interpreted as an expression of contempt for women only." &lt;ref name=slade/&gt;&lt;ref name="Faust, Beatrice 1980"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Faust, Beatrice |title=Women, sex, and pornography: a controversial and unique study |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1980 |pages= |isbn=0-02-537050-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She goes on to say "Logically, if sex is natural and wholesome and semen is as healthy as sweat, there is no reason to interpret ejaculation as a hostile gesture."&lt;ref name=slade/&gt;&lt;ref name="Faust, Beatrice 1980"/&gt;

Joseph Slade, professor at [[Ohio University]],&lt;ref name="Ohio University Faculty"/&gt; notes in his book ''Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide'' that adult industry actresses in the 1960s and 1970s did not trust birth control methods, and that more than one actress of the period told him that ejaculation inside her body was deemed inconsiderate if not rude.&lt;ref name=slade/&gt;

[[Sexology|Sexologist]] Peter Sándor Gardos argues that his research suggests that "... the men who get most turned on by watching cum shots are the ones who have positive attitudes toward women" (on the annual meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex in 1992).&lt;ref name="nearbycafe.com"&gt;[http://www.nearbycafe.com/loveandlust/steinberg/erotic/cn/cn2.html Bruce Herschensohn; Bill Clinton; Sexologists in San Diego; Future Sex 2] by Bruce Herschensohn.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on The World Pornography Conference in 1998, he reported a similar conclusion, namely that "no pornographic image is interpretable outside of its historical and social context. Harm or degradation does not reside in the image itself".&lt;ref name=Labash&gt;[http://www.nerve.com/Dispatches/voicebox/MenOnPorn/Labash_excerpt.asp Excerpt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808193947/http://www.nerve.com/Dispatches/voicebox/MenOnPorn/Labash_excerpt.asp |date=2009-08-08 }} from "Among the Pornographers," Matt Labash's coverage of the 1998 World Pornography Conference for ''The Weekly Standard''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cindy Patton]], activist and scholar on human sexuality, claims that in western culture male sexual fulfillment is synonymous with orgasm and that the male orgasm is an essential punctuation of the sexual narrative. No orgasm, no sexual pleasure. No cum shot, no narrative closure. In other words, the cum shot is the period at the end of the sentence.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;
In her essay "Visualizing Safe Sex: When Pedagogy and Pornography Collide", Patton reached the conclusion that critics have devoted too little space to discovering the meaning that viewers attach to specific acts such as cum shots.&lt;ref name=slade /&gt;&lt;ref name=Patton&gt;{{cite book |last=Patton |first=Cindy |authorlink=Cindy Patton |editor-last=Fuss |editor-first=Diana |title=Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-90236-6 |chapter=Visualizing Safe Sex: When Pedagogy and Pornography Collide |chapterurl=https://books.google.ca/books?id=5W0HU_U6cpQC&amp;pg=PA373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Anaerobic digestate.JPG|right|thumbnail|300px|Acidogenic digestate produced from mixed [[municipal waste]] ]]
'''Digestate''' is the material remaining after the anaerobic digestion of a [[biodegradable]] feedstock. [[Anaerobic digestion]] produces two main products: digestate and [[biogas]]. Digestate is produced both by [[acidogenesis]] and [[methanogenesis]] and each has different characteristics.

== Acidogenic digestate ==

Acidogenic digestate is fibrous and consists of structural plant matter including [[lignin]] and [[cellulose]]. Acidogenic digestate has high moisture retention properties. The digestate may also contain [[minerals]] and remnants of [[bacteria]].

== Methanogenic digestate ==

Methanogenic digestate is a sludge (sometimes called a liquor). This is often high in nutrients such as [[ammonium]]s and [[phosphate]]s.

==Uses==

The primary use of digestate is as a [[soil conditioner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 Evaluation of Opportunities for Converting Indigenous UK Wastes to Fuels and Energy (Report), NNFCC 09-012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181907/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acidogenic digestate provides [[moisture retention]] and organic content for soils. This organic material can break down further, aerobically in [[soil]]. Methanogenic digestate provides nutrients for [[plant]] growth. It can also be used to protect soils against erosion.

Acidogenic digestate can also be used as an [[environmentally friendly]] filler to give structure to [[Plastic compounding|composite plastics]].

Growth trials on digestate originating from mixed waste have showed healthy growth results for crops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexmarshall.me.uk/index_files/documents/ResponsetoConsultationonthesourcesegregationrequirementinParagraph7AofSchedule3totheWasteMan.pdf Response to source segregation requirement], www.alexmarshall.me.uk, Retrieved 22.02.07&lt;/ref&gt; Digestate can also be used in intensive greenhouse cultivation of plants, e.g. in [[Digeponics]].

Application of digestate has been shown to inhibit plant diseases and induction of resistance. Digestate application has a direct effect on soil-born diseases, and an indirect effect by stimulation of biological activity.

==Digestate and compost==
Digestate is technically not [[compost]] although it is similar to it in physical and chemical characteristics. Compost is produced by [[aerobic digestion]]- [[Aerobic decomposition|decomposition by aerobes]]. This includes [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]] which are able to break down the lignin and cellulose to a greater extent.

==Standards for digestate==
The standard of digestate produced by anaerobic digestion can be assessed on three criteria, chemical, biological and physical aspects. Chemical quality needs to be considered in terms of heavy metals and other inorganic contaminant, persistent organic compounds and the content of macro-elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Depending on their source, biowastes can contain pathogens, which can lead to the spreading of human, animal or plant diseases if not appropriately managed. 

The physical standards of composts includes mainly appearance and odour factors. Whilst physical contamination does not present a problem with regards to human, plant or animal health, contamination (in the form of plastics, metals and ceramics) can cause a negative public perception. Even if the compost is of high quality and all standards are met, a negative public perception of waste-based composts still exists. The presence of visible contaminants reminds users of this.

Quality control of the feedstock is the most important way of ensuring a quality end product. The content and quality of waste arriving on-site should be characterised as thoroughly as possible prior to being supplied.

In the UK the [[Publicly Available Specification]] (called PAS110) governs the definition of digestate derived from the anaerobic digestion of source-segregated biodegradable materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrap.org.uk/ad WRAP Anaerobic Digestion Page]&lt;/ref&gt; The specification ensures all digested materials are of consistent quality and fit for purpose. If a biogas plant meets the standard, its digestate will be regarded as having been fully recovered and to have ceased to be waste, and it can be sold with the name “Bio- fertiliser”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biogas-info.co.uk/index.php/standards-agri.html UK's Official Information Portal on Anaerobic Digestion and Biogas, Digestate Standards Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ecce Homo''''' ('''Behold the Man''') in the Sanctuary of Mercy church in [[Borja, Zaragoza|Borja]], Spain, is a [[fresco]] painted circa 1930 by the Spanish painter [[Elías García Martínez]] depicting [[Jesus]] [[Crown of thorns|crowned with thorns]]. Both the subject and style are typical of traditional [[Catholic art]].&lt;ref name=CentroBorjanos&gt;[http://cesbor.blogspot.com.es/2012/08/un-hecho-incalificable.html "Un hecho incalificable"] (in Spanish).

==Failed restoration attempt and internet phenomenon==
[[File:Attempted restoration of Ecce Homo.jpg|thumb|180px|Cecilia Giménez's attempted restoration of the fresco]]

The authorities in Borja said they had suspected vandalism at first, but then determined that the alterations had been made by an elderly parishioner, Doña Cecilia Giménez, who was in her 80s. She said on Spanish national television that she had started to restore the fresco, because she was upset that parts of it had flaked off due to moisture on the church's walls. Giménez defended herself, saying she could not understand the uproar because she had worked in broad daylight and had tried to salvage the fresco with the approval of the local clergyman. "The priest knew it," she told Spanish television. "I've never tried to do anything hidden."&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt;

News of the disfigured painting spread around the globe in August 2012 on mainstream and social media, which promptly led to the status of an [[List of Internet phenomena|internet phenomenon]]. BBC Europe correspondent [[Christian Fraser]] said that the result resembled a "crayon sketch of a very hairy monkey in an ill-fitting tunic".&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The restored version has been jokingly dubbed ''"Ecce Mono"'' ('Behold the Monkey,' ''ecce'' is Latin, whereas ''mono'' is Spanish for 'monkey'; in Latin, it is ''simius'') in an "online rush of global hilarity",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |department=Editorial |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=24 August 2012 |title=Ecce mono |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/269a80c4-edec-11e1-8d72-00144feab49a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Elderly woman destroys 19th century fresco in do-it-herself restoration attempt |date=27 August 2012 |author=Victoria Cavaliere |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/elderly-woman-destroys-19th-century-fresco-do-it-herself-restoration-attempt-article-1.1142772 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=De Ecce Homo... |work=[[El Heraldo (Tegucigalpa)|El Heraldo]] |date=23 August 2012 |quote=Malestar e hilaridad general por destrozo que anciana 'restauradora' ocasionó a pintura.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compared to the plot of the film ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/23/church-masterpiece-restored-as-mr-bean-would-do-it |title=Church masterpiece 'restored' as Mr. Bean would do it |publisher=CNN |date= 23 August 2012|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the negative attention, the priest of the church, Father Florencio Garces, thought the painting should be covered up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=David Randall |author2=Megan Tatum |title=Botched art is an online sensation |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-33520671.html |location=London, England |publisher=''The Independent on Sunday'' (via HighBeam Research) |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic significance==
[[Tongue-in-cheek]] critiques have interpreted the piece as a multifaceted comment on both [[sacred]] and [[Secularity|secular]] themes. A ''[[Forbes]]'' commentator suggested that the "inept restoration" represented "one woman's vision of her savior, uncompromised by schooling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=[...] the updated monkey-like Christ has a freakish new power all its own, and may be its own kind of metaphor for modern man. |title=Spanish Octogenarian's Disastrous Unauthorized Art Restoration Yields Surprisingly Avant-Garde Results |author=Alexander Forbes |work=Art+Auction |date=23 August 2012 |url=http://artinfo.com/news/story/821028/spanish-octogenarians-disastrous-unauthorized-art-restoration-yields-surprisingly-avant-garde-results |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | quote= Works such as the Giménez Jesus are as vital for believers – and as insightful for the rest of us – as traditional masterpieces, albeit for different reasons...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6192">The '''Erasmus Research Institute of Management''' (ERIM) is the joint research institute of the [[Rotterdam School of Management]] and the [[Erasmus School of Economics]], both at [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]]. It aims to bring together top researchers in [[business]] and [[management]] from each of these schools. Alongside its research program ERIM also has a [[graduate program]] in management designed to attract and train young scholars from around the world.&lt;ref name="erim.eur.nl"&gt;[https://www.erim.eur.nl/about-erim/ About ERIM], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ERIM seeks to contribute to "scientific research that enables organisations to assess and improve their [[business processes]] in order to perform in a profitable and responsible way."&lt;ref name="erim.eur.nl"/&gt;

== History ==
ERIM was founded in 1999. It modeled itself on the top American and European [[business schools]] such as [[Wharton Business School]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]], [[UCLA Anderson School of Management]], [[London Business School]], and [[INSEAD]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://api.rsm.nl/publications/rsmoutlook/id/7fb9c140-7a5f-11e1-a14c-8737be83186e/format/pdf RSM Outlook Summer 2010], page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, ERIM has become one of the top three schools in business research in Europe, and is among the top 25 in the world.&lt;ref name="Outlook_Summer_2010-FINAL page 22"&gt;[http://api.rsm.nl/publications/rsmoutlook/id/7fb9c140-7a5f-11e1-a14c-8737be83186e/format/pdf RSM Outlook Summer 2010], page 22&lt;/ref&gt; It has achieved a top ranking at the [[Social Science Research Network|Social Science Research Network (SSRN)]], periodically ranking first outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsm.nl/about-rsm/news/detail/1350-erim-research-tops-ssrn-ranking-again/ ERIM RESEARCH TOPS SSRN RANKING AGAIN] at ''rsm.nl/about-rsm/news''. Thursday, June 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next decade, ERIM will additionally focus on impacting business practice and the views of business professionals and the general public.&lt;ref name="rsm.nl"&gt;[http://api.rsm.nl/publications/rsmoutlook/id/7fb9c140-7a5f-11e1-a14c-8737be83186e/format/pdf RSM Outlook Summer 2010], page 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Within ERIM, research in management is divided into five broad streams: [[marketing]]; [[finance]] and [[accounting]]; [[strategy]]; [[organization]] and [[business processes]]; [[logistics]] and [[information systems]].&lt;ref name= "ERIM 2010" &gt;erim.eur.nl/portal/page/portal/... Accessed November 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, more than 200 researchers are engaged in ERIM’s research programs.&lt;ref name= "ERIM 2010"/&gt;  They are an international collection of researchers with backgrounds in [[business administration]] as well as other disciplines such as [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[econometrics]] and technical sciences.&lt;ref name="Outlook_Summer_2010-FINAL page 22"/&gt;

Also under ERIM’s umbrella are more than 20 specialist research centers, focusing on topics as diverse as customer value chains, [[Mutual fund|mutual]] and [[hedge fund]]s, [[neuroeconomics]], [[entrepreneurship]], closed loop supply chains, [[sustainability]], [[climate change]], and business in China.&lt;ref name= "ERIM 2010"/&gt;

== Doctoral program ==
As a graduate school, ERIM offers a five-year doctoral program, broken down into two years of course work (following which the candidate receives a [[Master's degree|Master]] title) with three years applied to [[dissertation]]. The [[PhD degree]] is awarded following a successful defense of the dissertation. Candidates must have a [[Bachelor degree]] to enter the program. Candidates who already have an [[MSc]] degree may enter the program as second-year students, while those who have already received a relevant [[MPhil]] degree may enter as third-year students. The main goal of the program is to train promising students with academic ambitions to build competitive research profiles, so that they can attain faculty positions at top business schools around the world and become “[[thought leader]]s”.&lt;ref name= "ERIM 2010"/&gt;

The ERIM PhD Program in Management is part of the doctoral program. To enter the program, an [[MPhil]], [[MSc]] or [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree is mandatory. In 2010, around 100 students from around 30 countries were enrolled in the PhD program.&lt;ref name= "ERIM 2010"/&gt;

ERIM offers two types of PhD Projects:

* '''ERIM Predefined PhD Projects''' train future researchers in or across five key disciplines of management: [[business processes]], [[logistics]] &amp; [[information systems]], [[organization]], [[marketing]], [[finance]], and [[strategy]]. These projects are initiated each year.&lt;ref name= "ERIM 2010"/&gt;
* '''ERIM Open PhD Projects''' are designed to give PhD candidates much freedom in choosing their own research topic. These open projects are financed with an endowment of 800,000 euros from the [[Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research|Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)]]. ERIM was one of nine Dutch academic institutions who were awarded the grant in 2009, which was intended to give future doctoral students more say in the research to be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;nwo.nl/nwohome.nsf/...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5244">Fluvio refers to things related to rivers and glacial refers to something that is of ice. '''Fluvio-glacial''' refers to the [[meltwater]] created when a [[glacier]] melts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/fluvio-|title=fluvio- - definition of fluvio- in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/glacial|title=glacial - definition... of glacial in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluvio-glacial processes can occur on the surface and within the glacier. The [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]] that happen within the glacier are revealed after the entire glacier melts or partially retreats. Fluvio-glacial [[landform]]s and [[erosion]]al surfaces include: [[outwash plain]]s, [[kame]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, kame terraces, [[Kettle (landform)|kettle holes]], [[esker]]s, [[varve]]s, and [[proglacial lake]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolgeography.co.uk/A-level/AQA/Year%2012/Cold%20environs/Fluvioglacial/Fluvioglacial%20landforms.htm|title=Fluvioglacial Landforms|last=|first=|date=|website=Coolgeography.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landforms ==

=== Outwash Plain ===
An outwash plain is both an erosional and depositional surface created by meltwater coming from the glacier. These plains are found in front of the glaciers and are typically characterized by small [[Braided river|braided streams]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The streams are usually small and braided because the [[sediment]] size varies and the original stream gets broken up.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since these streams [[meander]] around, the erosion happens laterally (left to right)  instead of vertically (up and down).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These plains are usually found beyond the [[Terminal moraine|end moraine]] deposited by the glacier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Kame and Kame Terrace ===
[[Kame]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are small hills that consist of sediments ranging from sands to gravels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geomorphology|last=Gutierrez|first=Mateo|publisher=CRC Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=538–545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intraglacial movement of water carries sediments and deposits them inside cavaties, or holes, in the glacier; once the glacier melts or retreats, the kames is left behind as a deposit. These hills can range in size and be up to 50 m tall and 400 m wide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A kame terrace is a relatively flat surface of sediment that was deposited between the valley surface and the glacier. When kames, kame surfaces, and other fluvio-glacial landforms are combined into one landscape, it is called a kame complex or glacial [[Karst|karst topography]].

=== Kettle Holes ===
[[Kettle (landform)|Kettle holes]] are typically formed when a chunk of ice that came from the glacier is buried under fluvio-glacial sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/higher/geography/physical/lithosphere/revision/7/|title=BBC - Higher Bitesize Geography - Lithosphere : Revision, Page7|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the ice melts, the sediments fall and form a depression that can later be filled with rainwater and form [[Kettle (landform)|kettle lakes]]. Kettle holes can often be found in the outwash plain of a glacier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kettle holes can be anywhere from 5 m to 30&amp;nbsp;km wide.

=== Eskers ===
Eskers can be describes as long, curved ridges made up of sands and gravels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Soil_Geomorphology.html?id=H9FSveDbpbsC|title=Soil Geomorphology|last=Gerrard|first=A J|date=|website=Google Books|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These surfaces were created by intraglacial streams carrying and depositing sediments as they flow through the glacier. These landforms can range from 100 m to 500&amp;nbsp;km long and 3 m to 200 m tall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Varves ===
Varves are a depositional feature of a fluvio-glacial movement. They are layers of annual sediment deposits. The sizes of the sediments vary and depend on the volume of the streams, but are usually associated with mud deposits ([[silt]] and [[clay]]).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/varved-deposit|title=varved deposit {{!}} geology|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The color and amount of the sediment deposited also varies depending upon the season; summer deposits typically have larger volumes of deposition and are characterized as being light, whereas winter deposits are usually the opposite.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Winter deposits are fairly uncommon because the water is frozen into ice again.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Proglacial Lakes ===
[[Proglacial lake]]s form as meltwater trapped behind a glacial feature such as an end moraine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These lakes have an intake of sediment deposited by streams within the glacier and their deposits are recorded within the varves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Haitian Vodou art''' is art related to the [[Haitian Vodou]] religion. This religion has its roots in West African traditional religions brought to [[Haiti]] by slaves, but has assimilated elements from Europe and the Americas and continues to evolve. The most distinctive Vodou art form is the ''drapo Vodou'', an embroidered flag often decorated with sequins or beads, but the term covers a wide range of visual art forms including paintings, embroidered clothing, clay or wooden figures, musical instruments and assemblages. Since the 1950s there has been growing demand for Vodou art by tourists and collectors.

==Origins==

Art historians disagree on the origins of Haitian Vodou arts. [[Suzanne Blier]] makes the case that they come from the coastal areas of [[Benin]] and [[Togo]]. [[Robert Farris Thompson]] makes a plausible connection with Central Africa based on similarities with ''[[nkisi]]'' figures from the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]], and cosmograms, flags, drums and dances from that region.{{sfn|Vanhee|2002|p=244}}

The first slaves from West and Central Africa were brought to the Caribbean in the 16th century. Europeans often claimed that the slaves were being rescued from devil worship. 
However, the slaves maintained their religious practices in secret, and their priests were among the leaders of the first revolt in [[Haiti]] in 1791.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}}
Haiti became the first independent nation of African people in the [[Western Hemisphere]] in 1804 under President [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]].{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The traditional religion continued to be banned, and as late as the 1940s the Catholic church undertook a campaign against Vodou, ransacked temples and burned religious artifacts. 
Many of the techniques of sacred art have now been forgotten, and few sculptures were being made by 2001.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}}
The Vodou religion was finally recognized officially in 2002.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

The great majority of Haitians still practice the Vodou{{efn|The word ''Vodou'' means spirit.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}}} religion. 
The religion continues to evolve, and in addition to the traditional West African ''lwo'' (spirits) it now includes the spirits of heroes of resistance to the colonial forces, and spirits of powerful religious leaders.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The iconography of the Haitian Vodou religion combines elements from Africa, Europe and the Americas.{{sfn|Cosentino|2013}}
Thus a ''drapo'' made for an African spirit may include an image of a Catholic saint. 
The saint's image was originally in part designed to deceive Catholic missionaries, but also was chosen in recognition of similarity between the saint and the ''lwa''.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}}
Since then the saint and the spirit have become [[Syncretism|syncretized]].{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}

==Interpretation==
[[File:Antique ceremonial suit for Haitian Vodou Voudun rites.jpg|thumb|Antique ceremonial suit for Haitian Vodou rites]]
Vodou art can be difficult to classify in Western terms. 
Rachel Beauvoir-Dominique, writing of Marianne Lehmann's{{efn|Marianne Lehmann is a former Swiss diplomat who made her home in Port au Prince, Haiti, where she collected about 2,000 examples of Haitian sacred art over a twenty year period. [[UNESCO]] has contributed some funds towards indexing and photographing the collection, which includes musical instruments, figures dressed in costumes and other artifacts.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}} }} Vodou art collection, notes that "even today, the Creole language does not possess any word to designate what Western civilization qualifies as 'art'."{{sfn|Benedicty-Kokken|2014|p=244}}
Poet and critic [[André Breton]] dismissed Haitian art, noting that Haiti had no museums or art collections. 
He apparently saw no value in the art associated with the "backward" Vodou religion.{{sfn|Benedicty-Kokken|2014|p=245}}

Some scholars distinguish narrative Haitian art, which may include depictions of events or ceremonies in which there are many images from Vodou, from "Vodou art" in the sense of art that has a sacred function. The latter would be designed for use in ceremonies or for placement in temples or on altars. 
Given the omnipresence of Vodou in Haiti, most narrative art would also include Vodou images.{{sfn|Crown|Rivers|Wilson|2013|p=110-111}}
However, the fluid and adaptive nature of Vodou makes it hard to clearly distinguish religion, art and religious art.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}

Alessandra Benedicty points out that Western scholars are led by their [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] intellectual framework into trying to explain Vodou art in terms of "intellectual truths". 
Vodou is open-ended and sometimes purposely dissimulates. 
Benedicty writes that in "the Vodou/Haitian aesthetic system, the ''objet d'art'' nurtures ambivalence and demands that the reader or the spectator interpret and thus participate in the production of an artistic text's meaning."  If there is a ''[[veve]]'' in the work, there is a possibility that the ''[[lwa]]'' the work was made for will possess the viewer.{{sfn|Glover|2010|p=194}}
The purchaser of a Vodou altar or other artwork may be possessed by their purchase.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}
A 1995 exhibit at the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in California of "The Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou"  included dramatic ritual interactions between Vodouists and ''lwa'' that may have included possession.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}

==Drapo==
A ''drapo Vodou'' is a handmade flag, typically embroidered and decorated with beads and sequins.
Although flags may have been made in West Africa before the arrival of Europeans, the flags widely used there by 1600 were derived from European flags. 
They were used as symbols of ethnic, military or religious allegiance.
The ''drapo Vodou'' also drew on Yoruba beadwork, Catholic vestments and Masonic aprons.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
In the 19th century and early 20th century most ''drapo Vodou'' were made from one or two colored fabric pieces decorated with embroidery, metal bangles and glass beads, with an image of the ''lwa'' made of shiny fabrics [[appliqué]]d to the cloth using techniques still followed in West Africa.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
Flags and banners used in the 21st century in rural areas often still have stylistically simple designs, in part due to the high cost of decorative material.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=18}}

With the older flags the background field that frames the image was usually decorated with widely spaced sequins or beads. 
Modern flag makers often completely cover the fabric of the field with sparkling sequins of one color, or with intricate geometrical patterns. 
Borders, which were either simple or did not exist on early ''drapo Vodou'', have evolved into highly elaborate patterns.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=21}}
The use of sequins in modern ''drapos'' dates to 1940, when Joseph Fortine saw a troupe of Afro-Brazilian samba dancers wearing sequin costumes in a Carnival parade. Fortine began to decorate the costumes of [[Rara]] band players with sequins, and in 1943 made a ''drapo Vodou'' for [[Damballa]] from a burlap coffee sack which he stretched on a wooden frame.
He made the image from sequin lines on a satin background, and added random sequins surrounding the image. 
Fortine taught his techniques to sequin artists such as Edgard Jean Louis, Sylva Joseph, Clotaire Bazile, and Yves Telemak. 
The youngest of these, Telemak, was the first to sign his work.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

There are two kinds of ''drapo Vodou''. The ''drapo servis'' are made for ceremonial use, and art flags are made for sale.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

===Drapo servis===
[[File:Trop Pou Te Haitian Vodou banners.jpg|thumb|Haitian Vodou drapos. The front flag is for Trop Pou Te.]]
The ''drapo servis'' are important religious icons. 
They are kept in shrine rooms, and carried by flag bearers in elaborate ceremonies in the main chamber of the temple. A ''drapo servis'' will include an image of a Catholic saint or a ''vèvè'' (trace-work emblem) of an ''lwa''{{efn|The ''lwas'' serve as intermediaries between humans and the supreme god.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} }} (spirit) such as [[Papa Legba]] or [[Ogun]] of the [[Yoruba religion]].{{sfn|Cosentino|2013}}
There are many ''lwas'', including [[Erzulie]], [[Guédé]], Damballa and [[La Sirene]].{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
The purpose of a ceremonial ''drapo'' is to flatter the ''lwa'' in the hope of gaining favor in return.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
Usually ''drapo servis'' are made in pairs, for example representing Ogun and Damballa.
Ogun was the ''lwa'' who led the slaves to freedom, and Damballa is the snake, representing the life force.
Ogun may be paired with other ''lwas''.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

A ''drapo servis'' will have a central image surrounded by a diamond-shaped border, will often have a fringe, and will be {{convert|36|by|36|in}} in size. The image may depict a Catholic saint associated with an ''lwa'' or may be a ''veve'' that represents the ''lwa'' symbolically and provides a gateway for it to enter the world of humans.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The image may be a [[Chromolithography|chromolithograph]], a vividly colored paper image from Italy, Mexico or Spain of a Catholic saint that has been syncretized with the corresponding African spirit of the drapo.  The image may be an outline of the saint traced from a chromolithograph, or may be a detailed and faithful copy of a chromolithograph in beads and sequins.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}

The most widely used images of saints are those of [[Isidore of Chios|Saint Isidore]], [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James Major]], [[Saint Patrick]] and the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Holy Virgin]].{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}
Veves include the ship of [[Agwé]], the cemetery cross of [[Baron Samedi]], the crossroads of Legba and so on.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=19}}
An image of a mermaid is used on flags for the water spirit [[LaSiren]]. 
This does not derive from ''veve'' or Catholic origins, but seems to have come from European nautical sources.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}
The image of a fish is important in Vodou as in Christian art, but the Vodou symbol comes from [[Fon people|Fon]] mythology rather than Christianity.{{sfn|Desmangles|1992|p=151}}
It represents Agwé, who corresponds to the Fon sea deity Agbê.
Agbê took the shape of a fish when he was given responsibility for the sea.{{sfn|Desmangles|1992|p=152}}

===Art flags===
[[File:VoodooValris.jpg|thumb|Flag by George Valris]]
Art flags show much wider variation in size and theme than ''drapo servis'', and rarely have a fringe. Some flags are closer to tapestries.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
In the 1950s collectors started to buy ''drapo Vodou'', and the ''oungan'' (priests) began to make them for sale as a source of income. 
The next generation of artists, active in the 1990s, included Eviland Lalanne, Joseph Oldof Pierre, Le Petit Frere Mogirus, Wagler Vital, Georges Valris, Roland Rockville, Ronald Gouin, and Antoine Oleyant. They introduced various innovations, in part driven by the shortage of materials for flagmaking. Antoine Oleyant has been called "the artist who really brought the flags into the realm of fine art."{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

In [[Port-au-Prince]] the skilled ''drapo'' artists have ready access to beads and sequins brought in from Canada and the United States. 
These artists earn their living from sales to tourists and to art galleries.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=18}}
In the 21st century there have been considerable changes to ''drapo Vodou'' as an art-form, in which artists such as Myrlande Constant{{efn|Myrlande Constant, born in 1970, was taught seamstress and beading techniques by her mother, and worked in a factory making wedding dresses. She taught herself flagmaking, using beads rather than sequins, and has since become internationally recognized.{{sfn|Ulysse|2011}} }} have introduced new themes and techniques.
Other contemporary ''drapo'' artists include Evelyne Alcide, Roudy Azor, Gabriel Chery, Lindor Chiler, Mireille Delice, Christian Dorleus and Josiane Joseph.
Their large and elaborate ''drapo'' represent in greater details the interactions with the ''lwas'' in events such as Vodou ceremonies and weddings.
They may also represent evangelical Christian themes, or have secular subjects.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
Edgard Jean Louis, a well-known flagmaker, made a flag called "Diana Erzulie" that included a photograph of the English [[Princess Diana]].{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
There is growing demand for such ''drapo'' by international art collectors.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}}

==Other objects==
[[File:Haitian vodou altar to Petwo, Rada, and Gede spirits; November 5, 2010..jpg|thumb|Altar to Petwo, Rada, and Gede spirits; 2010]]
In the 1940s Haitian professional artists began to create imitations of images provided by foreign entrepreneurs. The images represented the foreigners' view of the essence of Vodou art. This interaction was later dismissed and the Haitian works were stated to be [[Authenticity in art|authentic]].{{sfn|Richman|2008|p=203}}
In 1949 fifteen artists decorated the Episcopal Saint Trinite Cathedral in Port-au-Prince with murals that contrast Vodou art and traditional scenes from the bible.
Thirteen of the artists were Catholics and/or Vodouists.{{sfn|Thomas|2014|p=190}}
In the 1950s the murals became world famous. African gods were found in the symbolism of Christian images. Thus the "Damballah Virgin" by Andre Dimanche was identified as [[Erzulie]], a lwa connected to Aphrodite, Mater Dolorosa, health and an angry Madonna.{{sfn|Thomas|2014|p=191}}

A doll incorporated in a work of Vodou art can be animated so it can perform supernatural work, protecting the home. The Haitian Vodou priest Georges René explains the process, saying "anything can do mystique if you believe in it... you have to turn it into mystic. You baptize it. You make a ceremony. You put the food the ''lwa'' eats... after that you can work with it. It gets a soul. You can put it on an altar."{{sfn|Apter|Derby|2009|p=357}}

[[Pierrot Barra]] (1942–99) and Marie Cassaise made sacred altar installations from everyday objects such as dolls, sunglasses, sequins, speedometers, rosaries, mirrors and tinsel.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=9}}
Barra said his work was inspired by the Vodou spirits, who sometimes demanded it. He said, "When I sleep, while I'm dreaming, I see the Mysteries. When I sleep I see the spirits...they show me a design, some face, some kind of thing. Then when I wake up I create it."{{sfn|Cosentino|1999|p=16}}
A visitor to Port-au-Prince in 1991 described an altar installation Barra made for the mother goddess [[Ezili Dantor]]. Her head came from a plaster doll, with rouge, lipstick and white synthetic hair. She held a cutout picture of the baby Jesus, which represented the goddess's daughter Anais.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=9}}
A red fabric snake was wrapped round the body of the goddess, and a small rubber baby doll was at the foot of the statue. The whole was decorated with sparkles and cheap jewelry. This was not a traditional design, but was immediately recognized by Vodouists as authentic Vodou art.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=10}}

{{Hinduism}}
'''Hindu art''' encompasses the artistic traditions and styles culturally connected to [[Hinduism]] and have a long history of religious association with Hindu scriptures, rituals and worship.

==Background==
[[Hinduism]], with its [[Hinduism by country|1 billion followers]], it makes up about 15% of the world’s population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape - Hinduism|url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-hindu.aspx|work=A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World’s Major Religious Groups as of 2010|publisher=The pew foundation|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such the culture that ensues it is full of different aspects of life that are effected by art.  There are 64 traditional arts that are followed that start with the classics of music and range all the way to the application and adornment of jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;”Heart of Hinduism: Sanskrit and Sanskriti (Culture).” 2004, 30 Mar 2009. &lt; http://hinduism.iskcon.com/lifestyle/801.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since religion and culture are inseparable with Hinduism recurring symbols such as the gods and their reincarnations, the [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]] flower, extra limbs, and even the traditional arts make their appearances in many sculptures, paintings, music, and dance.

*Singing
*Instrumental music
**Learning music in [[Hindu culture]] was a difficult task before the 20th century because of a necessary birth into a [[gharana]]. After the early 1920s integration of anyone wanting to learn classical Hindustani music could. An average ensemble normally includes a harmonium (which was brought to India by westerners), flute, [[veena]], [[sitar]], swaramandala, and a tabla. Many of the songs have strong themes that are related to theology such as a god’s favorite pastimes, praise of any god whether they be in their original form from “the trinity” or the god's reincarnation, even stories of the creation of earth. Since instrumental music is a performance art it must follow strict guidelines that come from the treatise Natya Shastra.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Beck, Guy. “Hindu music, now and into the future.” Hinduism Today October/November/December 2007. 28-31. &lt; http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1515&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dancing
*Painting
**Indian variety - the different types of folk paintings are proud for Indian culture which reflects beauty, tradition and heritage of India. There are many types of traditional paintings like [[Madhubani art|Madhubani]], Rajsthani, [[Batik|Batik-Art]], Patachitra, Gond, Mandala, [[Warli|Tribal Art Warli]], [[Pithora (painting)|Pithora]], Bengali, Nirmal, [[Mysore painting|Mysore]], [[Tanjore]] paintings etc. which are the expressions of love, almighty, beauty, truth, tradition and art of each and every region of the India.

**Drapery- The art of drapery has progressed over time. At one point both men and women wore dhotis but around the 14th century that changed and women’s fashion became more intricate thus creating the sari. The drapery involved distinguishes the wearer’s taste, occupation, and social status. The fabrics chosen range from cotton and synthetic fabrics all the way to silk. The fabric chosen depends on what occasion the wearer is going to use the item of clothing for. The draping of the sari comes in four different families: [[Marvari]], [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]], Tribal, and Nivi. The family that the wearer chooses depends on the wearer’s personal taste. The way an item of clothing is draped tells a lot about the wearer such as expression of creativity, progression of fashion, and where the user comes from.&lt;ref&gt;Boulanger, Chantal. “The Remarkable Indian Art of Draping.” Hinduism Today. October/November/December 2008. 60-62. &lt;http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3078&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic Texts on Art Practices==

*Natya Shastra
**The Natya Shastra is the leading guide to the Hindu performing arts. It is based on the Natya Veda, which no longer exists, and is roughly 37 chapters long with 6,000 [[slokas]].&lt;ref&gt;“Natya Shastra: Encyclopedia II.” 29 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Natya_Shastra_-_Text_and_title/id/1793036&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cities Dedicated to the Production of Art==

*Raghupajpur
**This city is solely dedicated to the production of artwork that is driven by the divine forces of Hinduism and these artworks are produced in a traditional fashion. The city is located in Eastern India (Orissa) and at one point this city was at risk of being completely destroyed due to British rule{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}. During this time religion and the power of the kings were being overthrown and as such there was no reason for a city to exist whose main purpose is to supply traditional art. After this crisis occurred the city began to exclusively base itself on agriculture until a man named Jacnnath Mopatra led a training center for chitrakars. This revolution began production of the traditional art works once again in the 1950s and since the work being produced is known internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Mohanty, M.P. “Living, Painting, Worshipping Art.” Hinduism Today. July/August/September 2007. 54-59. &lt;http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1562&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common Symbols==

*Extra Limbs-Extra limbs are seen on many of the Hindu deities in paintings and sculptures. The extra limbs show how much power the god is capable of because of their ability to perform many tasks at once. Such as the goddess [[Sarasvati]] always has a minimum of four arms. Two of the arms will be playing a vina, representing the tuning of her knowledge, prayer beads in another hand and a scripture in another, both of these items are used to represent her devotion to her spirituality. Since she is the goddess of learning and art we see that she is very capable and very powerful in her area of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Knapp. “Saravasti, the Goddess of Learning.” 20 Mar 2009. &lt; http://www.stephen-knapp.com/sarasvati_goddess_of_learning.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lotus Flower-The lotus flower is another common item seen constantly throughout the arts. The lotus flower represents purity, beauty, prosperity, fertility, and transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;Anil K. Goel, Lucknow. “God’s Favorite Flower.” Hinduism Today. 1999. 15 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4411&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason the flower shows these attributes is due to the process in which the lotus flower goes through in order to blossom. The flower grows out of mud and rests atop the water in which it grows showing the hardship it must endure in order to achieve maximum beauty. Many deities have their name based on the Sanskrit word for lotus such as Lakshimi.&lt;ref&gt;“Lotus-Hindu Symbols” Religion Facts. 2007. 15 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/symbols/lotus.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Skin_Microbiome20169-300.jpg|250px|thumb|Graphic depicting the human [[skin microbiota]], with relative prevalences of various classes of bacteria]]

The '''human microbiota''' is the aggregate of [[microorganism]]s that resides on or within any of a number of human tissues and biofluids, including the skin, mammary glands, placenta, seminal fluid, uterus, ovarian follicles, lung, saliva, [[oral mucosa]], [[conjunctiva]], [[Biliary tract|biliary]] and gastrointestinal tracts. They include [[Bacterium|bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[Fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s and [[viruses]]. Though [[micro-animal]]s can also live on the human body, they are typically excluded from this definition. The '''human microbiome''' refers specifically to the collective [[genome]]s of resident microorganisms.&lt;ref name="Prescotts"&gt;{{cite book|last2 = Willey|first2 = Joanne|last1 = Sherwood|first1 = Linda|last3 = Woolverton|first3 = Christopher|title = Prescott's Microbiology|url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=sBCSRAAACAAJ}}|year = 2013|isbn = 9780073402406|publisher = McGraw Hill|location = New York|edition = 9th|pages = 713–721|oclc = 886600661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Microbiome Project]] took on the project of sequencing the genome of the human microbiota, focusing particularly on the microbiota that normally inhabit the skin, mouth, nose, digestive tract, and vagina.&lt;ref name="Prescotts"/&gt; It reached a milestone in 2012 when it published its initial results.&lt;ref name=hmpdata&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jun2012/nhgri-13.htm |title=NIH Human Microbiome Project defines normal bacterial makeup of the body |publisher=NIH News |date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
{{Life timeline}}
Though widely known as ''flora or'' ''microflora'', this is a [[misnomer]] in technical terms, since the word root ''[[flora]]'' pertains to plants, and ''[[Biota (ecology)|biota]]'' refers to the total collection of organisms in a particular ecosystem. Recently, the more appropriate term ''[[microbiota]]'' is applied, though its use has not eclipsed the entrenched use and recognition of ''flora'' with regard to bacteria and other microorganisms. Both terms are being used in different literature.&lt;ref name=Quigley2013rev/&gt;

==Relative numbers==
As of 2014, it was often reported in popular media and in the scientific literature that there are about 10 times as many microbial cells in the human body as there are human cells; this figure was based on estimates that the human microbiome includes around 100 trillion bacterial cells and that an adult human typically has around 10 trillion human cells.&lt;ref name=AAM2014/&gt; In 2014, the [[American Academy of Microbiology]] published a FAQ that emphasized that the number of microbial cells and the number of human cells are both estimates, and noted that recent research had arrived at a new estimate of the number of human cells{{spaced ndash}}approximately 37.2 trillion, meaning that the ratio of microbial-to-human cells, if the original estimate of 100 trillion bacterial cells is correct, is closer to 3:1.&lt;ref name=AAM2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosner/&gt; In 2016, another group published a new estimate of the ratio being roughly 1:1 (1.3:1, with "an uncertainty of 25% and a variation of 53% over the population of standard 70-kg males").&lt;ref name=NN2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sender/&gt;

==Study==
{{main|Human Microbiome Project}}
[[File:Microbiome analysis flowchart.png|thumb|right|Flowchart illustrating how the human microbiome is studied on the DNA level.]]
The problem of elucidating the human microbiome is essentially identifying the members of a microbial community which includes bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses.&lt;ref name="hmp"&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = The NIH Human Microbiome Project | url = | journal = Genome Res | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 2317–2323 | doi=10.1101/gr.096651.109 | pmid=19819907 | pmc=2792171| author1 = NIH Human Microbiome Working Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done primarily using DNA-based studies, though RNA, protein and metabolite based studies are also performed.&lt;ref name=hmp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kucz2012"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kuczynski | first1 = J. et al| doi = 10.1038/nrg3129| title = Experimental and analytical tools for studying the human microbiome| journal = Nature Reviews Genetics| volume = 13| issue = 1| pages = 47–58| year = 2011| pmid = 22179717| pmc =5119550}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA-based microbiome studies typically can be categorized as either targeted [[amplicon]] studies or more recently [[shotgun sequencing|shotgun]] [[metagenomics|metagenomic]] studies. The former focuses on specific known marker genes and is primarily informative taxonomically, while the latter is an entire metagenomic approach which can also be used to study the functional potential of the community.&lt;ref name=hmp/&gt; One of the challenges that is present in human microbiome studies, but not in other metagenomic studies is to avoid including the host DNA in the study.&lt;ref name="Vest2008"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Vestheim | first1 = H.| last2 = Jarman | first2 = S.

Aside from simply elucidating the composition of the human microbiome, one of the major questions involving the human microbiome is whether there is a "core", that is, whether there is a subset of the community that is shared among most humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Towards the human intestinal microbiota phylogenetic core |last=Tap |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=11 |issue=102 |pages=2574–2584 |year=2009|first1=Julien, et al. |last2=Mondot |pmid=19601958 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01982.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HK2009"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Hamady | first1 = M.| last2 = Knight | first2 = R.| doi = 10.1101/gr.085464.108| title = Microbial community profiling for human microbiome projects: Tools, techniques, and challenges| journal = Genome Research| volume = 19 | issue = 7| pages = 1141–1152| year = 2009| pmid = 19383763| pmc =}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a core, then it would be possible to associate certain community compositions with disease states, which is one of the goals of the [[Human Microbiome Project]]. It is known that the human microbiome (such as the gut microbiota) is highly variable both within a single subject and among different individuals, a phenomenon which is also observed in mice.&lt;ref name=Quigley2013rev/&gt; 
  
On 13 June 2012, a major milestone of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) was announced by the [[NIH]] director [[Francis Collins]].&lt;ref name=hmpdata/&gt; The announcement was accompanied with a series of coordinated articles published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A framework for human microbiome research|author=Human Microbiome Project Consortium |journal=Nature |volume=486 |issue=7402 |pages=215–221 |year=2012 |pmid=22699610| pmc=3377744| doi=10.1038/nature11209|bibcode=2012Natur.486..215T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Structure, function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome |author=The Human Microbiome Project Consortium |journal=Nature |volume=486 |issue=7402 |pages=207–214 |year=2012|pmid=22699609 |pmc=3564958 |doi=10.1038/nature11234 |bibcode=2012Natur.486..207T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and several journals in the [[Public Library of Science]] (PLoS) on the same day. By mapping the normal microbial make-up of healthy humans using genome sequencing techniques, the researchers of the HMP have created a reference database and the boundaries of normal microbial variation in humans. From 242 healthy U.S. volunteers, more than 5,000 samples were collected from tissues from 15 (men) to 18 (women) body sites such as mouth, nose, skin, lower intestine (stool), and vagina. All the DNA, human and microbial, were analyzed with DNA sequencing machines. The microbial genome data were extracted by identifying the bacterial specific ribosomal RNA, [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]]. The researchers calculated that more than 10,000 microbial species occupy the human ecosystem and they have identified 81 – 99% of the [[genera]].

=== Shotgun Sequencing ===
It is frequently difficult to culture in laboratory communities of [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[Virus|viruses]], therefore [[DNA sequencing|sequencing technologies]] can be exploited in [[metagenomics]], too. Indeed, the complete knowledge of the functions and the characterization of specific microbial strains offer a great potentiality in therapeutic discovery and human health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==== Collection of samples and DNA extraction ====
The main point is to collect an amount microbial biomass that is sufficient to perform the sequencing and to minimize the sample contamination; for this reason, enrichment techniques can be used. In particular, the [[DNA extraction]] method must be good for every bacterial [[Strain (biology)|strain]], not to have the [[Genome|genomes]] of the ones that are easy to [[Lysis|lyse]]. Mechanical lysis is usually preferred rather than chemical lysis, and bead beating may result in [[DNA]] loss when preparing the library.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==== Preparation of the library and sequencing ====
The most used platforms are [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]], [[Ion Torrent]], Oxford Nanopore [[MinION]] and [[Pacific Biosciences|Pacific Bioscience]] Sequel, although the Illumina platform is considered the most appealing option due to its wide availability, high output and accuracy. There are no indications regarding the correct amount of sample to use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==== Metagenome assembly ====
The [[De novo sequence assemblers|de novo]] approach is exploited; however, it presents some difficulties to be overcome. The [[Coverage (genetics)|coverage]] depends on each genome abundance in its specific community; low-abundance genomes may undergo [[Fragmentation (cell biology)|fragmentation]] if the sequencing depth is not sufficient enough to avoid the formation of gaps. Luckily, there are metagenome-specific assemblers to help, since, if hundreds of strains are present, the sequencing depth needs to be increased to its maximum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==== Contig binning ====
Neither from which genome every [[contig]] derives, nor the number of genomes present in the sample are known ''a priori''; the aim of this step is to divide the contigs into species. The methods to perform such analysis can be either supervised (database with known sequences) or unsupervised (direct search for contig groups in the collected data). However, both methods require a kind of metric to define a score for the similarity between a specific contig and the group in which it must be put, and algorithms to convert the similarities into allocations in the groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==== Analysis after the processing ====
The statistical analysis is essential to validate the obtained results ([[Anova|ANOVA]] can be used to size the differences between the groups); if it is paired with graphical tools, the outcome is easily visualized and understood.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quince|first=Christopher|last2=Walker|first2=Alan W|last3=Simpson|first3=Jared T|last4=Loman|first4=Nicholas J|last5=Segata|first5=Nicola|date=2017-09-12|title=Shotgun metagenomics, from sampling to analysis|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3935|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=En|volume=35|issue=9|pages=833–844|doi=10.1038/nbt.3935|issn=1087-0156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a metagenome is assembled, it is possible to infer the functional potential of the microbiome. The computational challenges for this type of analysis are greater than for single genomes, due the fact that usually metagenomes assemblers have poorer quality, and many recovered [[Gene|genes]] are non-complete or fragmented. After the gene identification step, the data can be used to carry out a functional annotation by means of multiple alignment of the target genes against [[orthologs]] databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claesson|first=Marcus J.|last2=Clooney|first2=Adam G.|last3=O'Toole|first3=Paul W.|date=2017-08-09|title=A clinician's guide to microbiome analysis|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrgastro.2017.97|journal=Nature Reviews Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology|language=En|volume=14|issue=10|doi=10.1038/nrgastro.2017.97|issn=1759-5045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marker gene analysis ===
It is a technique that exploits [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|primers]] to target a specific genetic region and enables to determine the microbial [[phylogenies]]. The genetic region is characterized by a highly variable region which can confer detailed identification; it is delimited by conserved regions, which function as [[Binding site|binding sites]] for primers used in [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. The main gene used to characterize [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] is [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S]] [[Ribosomal RNA|rRNA]] gene, while fungi identification is based on [[Internal transcribed spacer|Internal Transcribed Spacer]] (ITS). The technique is fast and not so expensive and enables to obtain a low-resolution classification of a microbial sample; it is optimal for samples that may be contaminated by host DNA. Primer affinity varies among all DNA sequences, which may result in biases during the amplification reaction; indeed, low-abundance samples are susceptible to overamplification errors, since the other contaminating microorganisms result to be over-represented in case of increasing the PCR cycles. Therefore, the optimization of primer selection can help to decrease such errors, although it requires complete knowledge of the microorganisms present in the sample, and their relative abundances.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knight|first=Rob|last2=Vrbanac|first2=Alison|last3=Taylor|first3=Bryn C.|last4=Aksenov|first4=Alexander|last5=Callewaert|first5=Chris|last6=Debelius|first6=Justine|last7=Gonzalez|first7=Antonio|last8=Kosciolek|first8=Tomasz|last9=McCall|first9=Laura-Isobel|date=2018-05-23|title=Best practices for analysing microbiomes|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41579-018-0029-9|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|volume=16|issue=7|pages=410–422|doi=10.1038/s41579-018-0029-9|issn=1740-1526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marker gene analysis can be influenced by the primer choice; in this kind of analysis it's desirable to use a well-validated protocol (such as the one used in the [[Earth Microbiome Project]]). The first thing to do in a marker gene amplicon analysis is to remove sequencing errors; a lot of sequencing platforms are very reliable, but most of the apparent sequence diversity is still due to errors during the sequencing process. To reduce this phenomenon a first approach is to cluster sequences into [[Operational taxonomic unit]] (OTUs): this process consolidates similar sequences (a 97% similarity threshold is usually adopted) into a single feature that can be used in further analysis steps; this method however would discard [[SNPs]] because they would get clustered into a single OTU. Another approach is [[Oligotyping (taxonomy)|Oligotyping]], which includes position-specific information from 16s rRNA sequencing to detect small nucleotide variations and from discriminating between closely related distinct taxa. These methods give as an output a table of DNA sequences and counts of the different sequences per sample rather than OTU.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another important step in the analysis is to assign a taxonomic name to microbial sequences in the data. This can be done using [[machine learning]] approaches that can reach an accuracy at genus-level of about 80%. Other popular analysis packages provide support for taxonomic classification using exact matches to reference databases and should provide greater specificity, but poor sensitivity. Unclassified microorganism should be further checked for organelle sequences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Phylogenetic Analysis ===
Many methods that exploit phylogenetic inference use the [[16S ribosomal RNA|16SRNA]] gene for Archea and Bacteria and the [[18S ribosomal RNA|18SRNA]] gene for Eukariotes. [[Phylogenetic comparative methods]] (PCS) are based on the comparison of multiple traits among microorganisms; the principle is: the closely they are related, the higher number of traits they share. Usually [[Phylogenetic comparative methods|PCS]] are coupled with phylogenetic generalized least square (PGLS) or other statistical analysis to get more significant results. Ancestral state reconstruction is used in microbiome studies to impute trait values for taxa whose traits are unknown. This is commonly performed with [[PICRUSt]], which relies on avaible databases. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] variables are chosen by researchers according to the type of study: through the selection of some variables with significant biological informations, it is possible to reduce the dimension of the data to analyse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Phylogenetic aware distance is usually performed with [[UniFrac]] or similar tools, such as Soresen's index or Rao's D, to quantify the differences between the different communities. All this methods are negatively affected by [[Horizontal gene transmission|horizontal gene trasmission]] (HGT), since it can generate errors and lead to the correlation of distant species. There are different ways to reduce the negative impact of HGT: the use of multiple genes or computational tools to assess the probability of putative HGT events.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Washburne|first=Alex D.|last2=Morton|first2=James T.|last3=Sanders|first3=Jon|last4=McDonald|first4=Daniel|last5=Zhu|first5=Qiyun|last6=Oliverio|first6=Angela M.|last7=Knight|first7=Rob|date=2018-05-24|title=Methods for phylogenetic analysis of microbiome data|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0156-0|journal=Nature Microbiology|language=En|volume=3|issue=6|pages=652–661|doi=10.1038/s41564-018-0156-0|issn=2058-5276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Bacteria ===
Populations of microbes (such as [[Bacterium|bacteria]] and [[yeast]]s) inhabit the skin and mucosal surfaces in various parts of the body. Their role forms part of normal, healthy human physiology, however if microbe numbers grow beyond their typical ranges (often due to a compromised immune system) or if microbes populate  (such as through poor hygiene or injury) areas of the body normally not colonized or sterile (such as the blood, or the lower respiratory tract, or the abdominal cavity), disease can result (causing, respectively, bacteremia/sepsis, pneumonia, and peritonitis).{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The Human Microbiome Project found that individuals host thousands of bacterial types, different body sites having their own distinctive communities. Skin and vaginal sites showed smaller diversity than the mouth and gut, these showing the greatest richness. The bacterial makeup for a given site on a body varies from person to person, not only in type, but also in abundance. Bacteria of the same species found throughout the mouth are of multiple subtypes, preferring to inhabit distinctly different locations in the mouth. Even the enterotypes in the human gut, previously thought to be well understood, are from a broad spectrum of communities with blurred taxon boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plos.org/media/press/2012/PLoS_%20HMP_Collection_Manuscript_Summaries.pdf PLoS Human Microbiome Project Collection Manuscript Summaries] 13 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2012/06/12149/consortium-scientists-map-human-bodys-bacterial-ecosystem|title = Consortium of Scientists Map the Human Body's Bacterial Ecosystem|work = ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that 500 to 1,000 [[Species (biology)|species]] of bacteria live in the human gut but belong to just a few phyla: [[Firmicutes]] and [[Bacteroidetes]] dominate but there are also [[Proteobacteria]], [[Victivallis vadensis|Verrumicrobia]], [[Actinobacteria]], [[Fusobacteria]] and [[Cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name=Sommer2013rev&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sommer | first1 = F | last2 = Bäckhed | first2 = F | date = April 2013 | title = The gut microbiota—masters of host development and physiology | url = | journal = Nat Rev Microbiol | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 227–38 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2974 | pmid = 23435359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of types of bacteria, such as ''[[Actinomyces]] viscosus'' and ''A. naeslundii'', live in the mouth, where they are part of a sticky substance called [[Dental plaque|plaque]]. If this is not removed by brushing, it hardens into [[Calculus (dental)|calculus]] (also called tartar).  The same bacteria also secrete acids that dissolve [[tooth enamel]], causing [[tooth decay]].

The [[Vaginal flora|vaginal microflora]] consist mostly of various [[lactobacillus]] species. It was long thought that the most common of these species was ''[[Lactobacillus acidophilus]]'', but it has later been shown that ''[[Lactobacillus iners|L. iners]]'' is in fact most common, followed by ''[[Lactobacillus crispatus|L. crispatus]]''. Other lactobacilli found in the vagina are ''[[L. jensenii]], [[Lactobacillus delbruekii|L. delbruekii]]'' and ''[[Lactobacillus gasseri|L. gasseri]]''. Disturbance of the vaginal flora can lead to infections such as [[bacterial vaginosis]] or [[candidiasis]] ("yeast infection").

=== Archaea ===
[[Archaea]] are present in the human gut, but, in contrast to the enormous variety of [[bacteria]] in this organ, the numbers of archaeal species are much more limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors = Eckburg PB, Bik EM, Bernstein CN, etal|title = Diversity of the human intestinal microbial flora|journal = Science|volume = 308|issue = 5728|pages = 1635–8|year = 2005|pmid = 15831718|doi = 10.1126/science.1110591|pmc = 1395357|bibcode = 2005Sci...308.1635E}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant group are the [[methanogen]]s, particularly ''[[Methanobrevibacter smithii]]'' and ''[[Methanosphaera|Methanosphaera stadtmanae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duncan SH, Louis P, Flint HJ |title = Cultivable bacterial diversity from the human colon|journal = Lett.

A study of twenty skin sites on each of ten healthy humans found 205 identified genera in nineteen bacterial phyla, with most sequences assigned to four phyla: [[Actinobacteria]] (51.8%), [[Firmicutes]] (24.4%), [[Proteobacteria]] (16.5%), and [[Bacteroidetes]] (6.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Grice|first1 = Elizabeth A.|year = 2006|last2 = Kong|first2 = HH|last3 = Conlan|first3 = S|last4 = Deming|first4 = CB|last5 = Davis|first5 = J|last6 = Young|first6 = AC|author7 = NISC Comparative Sequencing Program|last8 = Bouffard|first8 = GG|last9 = Blakesley|first9 = RW|last10 = Green|first10 = E.

The skin acts as a barrier to deter the invasion of pathogenic microbes. The human skin contains microbes that reside either in or on the skin and can be residential or transient. Resident microorganism types vary in relation to skin type on the human body. A majority of microbes reside on superficial cells on the skin or prefer to associate with glands. These glands such as oil or sweat glands provide the microbes with water, amino acids, and fatty acids. In addition, resident bacteria that associated with oil glands are often Gram-positive and can be pathogenic.&lt;ref name="Prescotts"/&gt;

=== Conjunctiva ===
A small number of bacteria and fungi are normally present in the [[conjunctiva]].&lt;ref name="mycobiome" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Textbook/&gt; Classes of bacteria include Gram-positive cocci (e.g., ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' and [[Streptococcus]]) and Gram-negative rods and cocci (e.g., ''[[Haemophilus]]'' and ''[[Neisseria]]'') are present.&lt;ref name=Textbook&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.textbookofbacteriology.net/normalflora_3.html|title = The Normal Bacterial Flora of Humans|work = textbookofbacteriology.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungal genera include ''Candida'', ''Aspergillus'', and ''Penicillium''.&lt;ref name="mycobiome" /&gt; The [[lachrymal glands]] continuously secrete, keeping the conjunctiva moist, while intermittent blinking lubricates the conjunctiva and washes away foreign material. Tears contain bactericides such as [[lysozyme]], so that microorganisms have difficulty in surviving the lysozyme and settling on the [[Epithelium|epithelial]] surfaces.

===Placenta===
{{Main|Placental microbiome}}

Until recently the [[placenta]] was considered to be a sterile organ but commensal, nonpathogenic bacterial species and genera have been identified that reside in the placental tissue.&lt;ref name="FoxEichelberger2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=Chelsea|last2=Eichelberger|first2=Kacey|title=Maternal microbiome and pregnancy outcomes|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=104|issue=6|year=2015|pages=1358–1363 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2015.09.037|pmid=26493119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WassenaarPanigrahi2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wassenaar|first1=T.M.|last2=Panigrahi|first2=P.|title=Is a foetus developing in a sterile environment?|journal=Letters in Applied Microbiology|volume=59|issue=6|year=2014|pages=572–579|doi=10.1111/lam.12334|pmid=25273890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schwiertz | first = Andreas | title = Microbiota of the human body : implications in health and disease | publisher = Springer | location = Switzerland | year = 2016 | page= 1 |isbn = 978-3-319-31248-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uterus===
{{Main|Uterine microbiome}}
Until recently, the upper reproductive tract of women was considered to be a sterile environment. A variety of microorganisms inhabit the uterus of healthy, asymptomatic women of reproductive age. The microbiome of the uterus differs significantly from that of the vagina and gastrointestinal tract.&lt;!--The first studies of bacteria colonizing the [[uterus]] were published in 2015, were on special populations, and were too small from which to generalize.  In one study of 58 women undergoing hysterectomy, investigators looked for 12 species of bacteria; ''Lactobacillus'' and ''Prevotella'' were the most commonly detected species and overall density was much lower than vaginal colonization.  In another study of 22 infertile women undergoing [[assisted reproductive technology|fertility treatments]], ''Lactobacillus'' and ''Flavobacterium'' were most prevalent, and characteristics of the flora were roughly similar in women who became pregnant and those who didn't.--&gt;&lt;ref name="FranasiakScott2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Franasiak|first1=Jason M.|last2=Scott|first2=Richard T.|title=Reproductive tract microbiome in assisted reproductive technologies|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=104|issue=6|year=2015|pages=1364–1371|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2015.10.012|pmid=26597628 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oral cavity ===
&lt;!--Please do not add new content here.  Please add it to the body of [[Oral microbiology]] and if it rises to the [[WP:LEAD]] of that article, update the lead, then copy that here with attribution. Per [[WP:SYNC]] --&gt;
{{Main|Oral microbiology}}
The environment present in the human mouth allows the growth of characteristic microorganisms found there. It provides a source of water and nutrients, as well as a moderate temperature.&lt;ref name="Prescotts" /&gt; Resident microbes of the mouth adhere to the teeth and gums to resist mechanical flushing from the mouth to stomach where acid-sensitive microbes are destroyed by hydrochloric acid.&lt;ref name="Prescotts" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wang2014rev/&gt;

Anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity include: ''[[Actinomyces]]'', ''[[Arachnia]]'', ''[[Bacteroides]]'', ''[[Bifidobacterium]]'', ''[[Eubacterium]]'', ''[[Fusobacterium]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', ''[[Leptotrichi]]a'', ''[[Peptococcu]]s'', ''[[Peptostreptococcus]]'', ''[[Propionibacterium]]'', ''[[Selenomonas]]'', ''[[Treponema]]'', and ''[[Veillonella]]''.&lt;ref name="sutter"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1093/clinids/6.Supplement_1.S62 |last1 = Sutter|first1 = V.

[[Bacteria]] accumulate on both the hard and soft oral tissues in [[biofilm]] allowing them to adhere and strive in the oral environment while protected from the environmental factors and antimicrobial agents.&lt;ref name="systemic disease 4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purnima|first1=Kumar|title=Oral microbiota and systemic disease|journal=Anaerobe|date=December 2013|volume=24|pages=90–93|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1075996413001625?_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_docanchor=&amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;ccp=y|accessdate=19 November 2017|doi=10.1016/j.anaerobe.2013.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saliva plays a key biofilm homeostatic role allowing recolonization of bacteria for formation and controlling growth by detaching biofilm buildup.&lt;ref name="ArweilerNetuschil2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arweiler |first1=Nicole B. |last2=Netuschil |first2=Lutz |chapter=The Oral Microbiota |editor=Andreas Schwiertz |title=Microbiota of the Human Body: Implications in Health and Disease |date=May 2016 |publisher=Springer,Cham |isbn=978-3-319-31248-4 |pages=45–60 |chapterurl=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-31248-4_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also provides a means of nutrients and temperature regulation. The location of the biofilm determines the type of exposed nutrients it receives.&lt;ref name="AvilaOjcius2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Avila |first1=Maria |last2=Ojcius |first2=David M. |last3=Yilmaz |first3=Özlem |title=The Oral Microbiota: Living with a Permanent Guest |journal=DNA and Cell Biology |volume=28 |issue=8 |year=2009 |pages=405–411 |issn=1044-5498 |doi=10.1089/dna.2009.0874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral bacteria have evolved mechanisms to sense their environment and evade or modify the host. However, a highly efficient innate host defense system constantly monitors the bacterial colonization and prevents bacterial invasion of local tissues. A dynamic equilibrium exists between [[dental plaque]] bacteria and the innate host defense system.&lt;ref name="AnthonyHRogers"/&gt;

This dynamic between host oral cavity and oral microbes plays a key role in health and disease as it provides entry into the body.&lt;ref name="ZarcoVess2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zarco |first1=MF |last2=Vess |first2=TJ |last3=Ginsburg |first3=GS |title=The oral microbiome in health and disease and the potential impact on personalized dental medicine |journal=Oral Diseases |volume=18 |issue=2|year=2012 |pages=109–120 |issn=1354-523X |doi=10.1111/j.1601-0825.2011.01851.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A healthy equilibrium presents a symbiotic relationship where oral microbes limit growth and adherence of pathogens while the host provides an environment for them to flourish.&lt;ref name="ZarcoVess2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="systemic disease 4" /&gt; Ecological changes such as change of immune status, shift of resident microbes and nutrient availability shift from a mutual to parasitic relationship resulting in the host being prone to oral and systemic disease.&lt;ref name="systemic disease 4" /&gt; Systemic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases has been correlated to poor oral health.&lt;ref name="ZarcoVess2012" /&gt; Of particular interest is the role of oral microorganisms in the two major dental diseases: [[dental caries]] and [[periodontal disease]].&lt;ref name=AnthonyHRogers&gt;{{cite book | author = Rogers A H (editor). | title = Molecular Oral Microbiology | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 |  isbn =  978-1-904455-24-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pathogen colonization at the periodontium cause an excessive immune response resulting in a periodontal pocket- a deepened space between the tooth and gingiva.&lt;ref name="systemic disease 4" /&gt; This acts as a protected blood-rich reservoir with nutrients for anaerobic pathogens.&lt;ref name="systemic disease 4" /&gt; Systemic disease at various sites of the body can result from oral microbes entering the blood bypassing periodontal pockets and oral membranes.&lt;ref name="ZarcoVess2012" /&gt;

Persistent proper oral hygiene is the primary method for preventing oral and systemic disease.&lt;ref name="ZarcoVess2012" /&gt; It reduces the density of biofilm and overgrowth of potential pathogenic bacteria resulting in disease.&lt;ref name="AvilaOjcius2009" /&gt; However, proper oral hygiene may not be enough as the oral microbiome, genetics, and changes to immune response play a factor in developing chronic infections.&lt;ref name="AvilaOjcius2009" /&gt; Use of antibiotics could treat already spreading infection but ineffective against bacteria within biofilms.&lt;ref name="AvilaOjcius2009" /&gt;

=== Lung ===
{{Main|Lung microbiome}}
Much like the oral cavity, the upper and lower respiratory system possess mechanical deterrents to remove microbes.  Goblet cells produce mucous which traps microbes and moves them out of the respiratory system via continuously moving [[Cilium|ciliated]] epithelial cells.&lt;ref name="Prescotts" /&gt; In addition, a bactericidal effect is generated by nasal mucus which contains the enzyme lysozyme.&lt;ref name="Prescotts" /&gt; The upper and lower respiratory tract appears to have its own set of microbiota.&lt;ref name="Man2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Man WH, ((de Steenhuijsen Piters WAA)), Bogaert D | title = The microbiota of the respiratory tract: gatekeeper to respiratory health | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 259–270 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28316330 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro.2017.14 | url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrmicro.2017.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulmonary bacterial microbiota belong to 9 major bacterial genera: ''Prevotella'', ''Sphingomonas'', ''Pseudomonas'', ''Acinetobacter'', ''Fusobacterium'', ''Megasphaera'', ''Veillonella'', ''Staphylococcus'', and ''Streptococcus''. Some of the bacteria considered "normal biota" in the respiratory tract can cause serious disease especially in immunocompromised individuals; these include ''Streptococcus pyogenes'', ''Haemophilus influenzae'', ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', ''Neisseria meningitidis'', and ''Staphylococcus aureus''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Fungal genera that compose the pulmonary mycobiome include ''Candida'', ''Malassezia'', ''Neosartorya'', ''Saccharomyces'', and ''Aspergillus'', among others.&lt;ref name="mycobiome" /&gt;

Unusual distributions of bacterial and fungal genera in the respiratory tract is observed in people with [[cystic fibrosis]].&lt;ref name="mycobiome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="beringer2000"&gt;{{Cite journal|volume = 6|issue = 6|pages = 545–550|last = Beringer|first = P M|author2 = M D Appleman|title = Unusual respiratory bacterial flora in cystic fibrosis: microbiologic and clinical features|journal = Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine|date = November 2000|url = http://www.usc.edu/hsc/pharmacy/pd_labs/COPM11-00.pdf|pmid = 11100967|doi = 10.1097/00063198-200011000-00015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131016102359/http://www.usc.edu/hsc/pharmacy/pd_labs/COPM11-00.pdf|archivedate = 16 October 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their bacterial flora often contains antibiotic-resistant and slow-growing bacteria, and the frequency of these pathogens changes in relation to age.&lt;ref name="beringer2000" /&gt;

=== Biliary tract ===
Traditionally the biliary tract has been considered to be normally sterile, and the presence of microorganisms in bile is a marker of pathological process. This assumption was confirmed by failure in allocation of bacterial strains from the normal bile duct. Papers began emerging in 2013 showing that the normal biliary microbiota is a separate functional layer which protects a biliary tract from colonization by exogenous microorganisms.&lt;ref name=Verdier2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verdier|first1=J|last2=Luedde|first2=T|last3=Sellge|first3=G|title=Biliary Mucosal Barrier and Microbiome.|journal=Viszeralmedizin|date=June 2015|volume=31|issue=3|pages=156–61|doi=10.1159/000431071|pmid=26468308|pmc=4569210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disease and death ==
A symbiotic relationship between the [[gut microbiota]] and different bacteria may influence an individual's immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Honda|first=Kenya|last2=Littman|first2=Dan R.|date=7 July 2016|title=The microbiota in adaptive immune homeostasis and disease|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v535/n7610/full/nature18848.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=535|issue=7610|pages=75–84|doi=10.1038/nature18848|pmid=27383982|bibcode=2016Natur.535...75H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer ===
Although cancer is generally a disease of host genetics and environmental factors, microorganisms are implicated in some 20% of human cancers.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garrett|first1=WS|title=Cancer and the microbiota|journal=Science|date=3 April 2015|volume=348|issue=6230|pages=80–6|doi=10.1126/science.aaa4972|pmid=25838377|pmc=5535753|bibcode=2015Sci...348...80G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly for potential factors in [[colon cancer]], bacterial density is one million times higher than in the [[small intestine]], and approximately 12-fold more cancers occur in the colon compared to the small intestine, possibly establishing a pathogenic role for microbiota in colon and [[rectum|rectal]] cancers.&lt;ref name="wjg"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4716055|year=2016|author1=Gagnière|first1=J|title=Gut microbiota imbalance and colorectal cancer|journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology|volume=22|issue=2|pages=501–518|last2=Raisch|first2=J|last3=Veziant|first3=J|last4=Barnich|first4=N|last5=Bonnet|first5=R|last6=Buc|first6=E|last7=Bringer|first7=M. A.|last8=Pezet|first8=D|last9=Bonnet|first9=M|doi=10.3748/wjg.v22.i2.501|pmid=26811603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbial density may be used as a [[prognosis|prognostic]] tool in assessment of colorectal cancers.&lt;ref name=wjg/&gt;

The microbiota may affect carcinogenesis in three broad ways: (i) altering the balance of tumor cell proliferation and death, (ii) regulating immune system function, and (iii) influencing metabolism of host-produced factors, foods and pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer /&gt; Tumors arising at boundary surfaces, such as the skin, [[oropharynx]] and respiratory, digestive and [[urogenital]] tracts, harbor a microbiota. Substantial microbe presence at a tumor site does not establish association or causal links. Instead, microbes may find tumor [[oxygen tension]] or nutrient profile supportive. Decreased populations of specific microbes or induced [[oxidative stress]] may also increase risks.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer /&gt;&lt;ref name=wjg/&gt; Of the around 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; microbes on earth, ten are designated by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] as human carcinogens.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer /&gt; Microbes may secrete proteins or other factors directly drive cell proliferation in the host, or may [[upregulation|up-]] or [[downregulation|down-regulate]] the host immune system including driving acute or chronic inflammation in ways that contribute to carcinogenesis.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer /&gt;

Concerning the relationship of immune function and development of inflammation, [[Mucous membrane|mucosal]] surface barriers are subject to environmental risks and must rapidly repair to maintain [[homeostasis]]. Compromised host or microbiota resiliency also reduce resistance to malignancy, possibly inducing inflammation and cancer. Once barriers are breached, microbes can elicit proinflammatory or immunosuppressive programs through various pathways.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer/&gt; For example, cancer-associated microbes appear to activate NF-κΒ signaling within the tumor microenviroment. Other pattern recognition receptors, such as [[NOD-like receptor|nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain–like receptor]] (NLR) family members [[NOD2|''NOD-2'']], ''[[NLRP3]]'', ''[[NLRP6]]'' and ''[[NLRP12]]'', may play a role in mediating colorectal cancer.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer/&gt;  Likewise ''Helicobacter pylori'' appears to increase the risk of gastric cancer,  due to its driving a chronic inflammatory response in the stomach.&lt;ref name=Garrett2015Cancer /&gt;&lt;ref name=wjg/&gt;

=== Inflammatory bowel disease ===
Inflammatory bowel disease consists of two different diseases: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and both of these diseases present with disruptions in the gut microbiota (also known as [[dysbiosis]]). This dysbiosis presents itself in the form of decreased microbial diversity in the gut,&lt;ref name=Sartor2012IBD&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sartor|first=R. Balfour|last2=Mazmanian|first2=Sarkis K.|date=July 2012|title=Intestinal Microbes in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases|url=http://www.nature.com/ajgsup/journal/v1/n1/full/ajgsup20124a.html|journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology Supplements|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=15–21|doi=10.1038/ajgsup.2012.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hold|first=Georgina L|last2=Smith|first2=Megan|last3=Grange|first3=Charlie|last4=Watt|first4=Euan Robert|last5=El-Omar|first5=Emad M|last6=Mukhopadhya|first6=Indrani|date=7 February 2014|title=Role of the gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis: What have we learnt in the past 10 years?|journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology|volume=20|issue=5|pages=1192–1210|doi=10.3748/wjg.v20.i5.1192|pmc=3921503|pmid=24574795}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is correlated to defects in host genes that changes the innate immune response in individuals.&lt;ref name=Sartor2012IBD/&gt;

===Human immunodeficiency virus===
The [[HIV]] disease progression influences the composition and function of the gut microbiota, with notable differences between HIV-negative, HIV-positive, and post-[[Anti-retroviral|ART]] HIV-positive populations.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} HIV decreases the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier function by affecting [[tight junction]]s. This breakdown allows for translocation across the gut epithelium, which is thought to contribute to increases in inflammation seen in people with HIV.&lt;ref name=Zilberman2016HIV&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zilberman-Schapira|first=Gili|last2=Zmora|first2=Niv|last3=Itav|first3=Shlomik|last4=Bashiardes|first4=Stavros|last5=Elinav|first5=Hila|last6=Elinav|first6=Eran|date=2016|title=The gut microbiome in human immunodeficiency virus infection|journal=BMC Medicine|volume=14|issue=1|pages=83|doi=10.1186/s12916-016-0625-3|pmc=4891875|pmid=27256449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaginal microbiota plays a role in the infectivity of HIV, with an increased risk of infection and transmission when the woman has [[bacterial vaginosis]], a condition characterized by an abnormal balance of vaginal bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrova|first=Mariya I.|last2=van den Broek|first2=Marianne|last3=Balzarini|first3=Jan|last4=Vanderleyden|first4=Jos|last5=Lebeer|first5=Sarah|date=1 September 2013|title=Vaginal microbiota and its role in HIV transmission and infection|url=https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/37/5/762/542986/Vaginal-microbiota-and-its-role-in-HIV|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|volume=37|issue=5|pages=762–792|doi=10.1111/1574-6976.12029}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enhanced infectivity is seen with the increase in [[Proinflammatory cytokine|pro-inflammatory cytokines]] and [[CCR5|CCR5 +]] CD4+ cells in the vagina. However, a decrease in infectivity is seen with increased levels of vaginal ''Lactobacillus,'' which promotes an anti-inflammatory condition.&lt;ref name=Zilberman2016HIV/&gt;

=== Death ===
{{main|necrobiome}}
With death the microbiome of the living body collapses and a different microbiome named necrobiome establishes itself. Its predictable changes over time are thought to be useful to help determine the time of death.&lt;ref name=sa16&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/necrobiome-reveals-a-corpses-time-of-death/| author= Christopher Intagliata |title="Necrobiome" Reveals a Corpse's Time of Death |journal=[[Scientific American]] |date=22 December 2016 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atl15&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/12/meet-the-necrobiome-the-predictable-microbes-that-will-eat-your-dying-corpse/419676/ | author=Ed Young |title= Meet the Necrobiome: The Waves of Microbes That Will Eat Your Corpse |publisher=[[The Atlantic]]| date=10 December 2015| accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental health ==
Studies in 2009 questioned whether the decline in [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] (including [[microfauna]]) as a result of human intervention might impede human health, hospital safety procedures, food product design, and treatments of disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=human-microbiome-change|title = Bugs Inside: What Happens When the Microbes That Keep Us Healthy Disappear?|author = Katherine Harmon|publisher = Scientific American|date = 16 December 2009|accessdate = 27 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Migration ==
Preliminary research indicates that immediate changes in the microbiota may occur when a person [[International migration|migrates]] from one country to another, such as when [[Thailand|Thai]] [[immigrant]]s settled in the United States.&lt;ref name="vangay"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vanagay|first1=Pajau|last2=et al.|date=1 November 2018|title=US immigration westernizes the human gut microbiome|url=https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(18)31382-5.pdf|journal=Cell|volume=175|pages=962–972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Losses of microbiota diversity were greater in obese individuals and children of immigrants.&lt;ref name=vangay/&gt;

The '''Institute of Astronomy''' ('''IoA''') is the largest of the three [[Astronomy departments in the University of Cambridge|astronomy departments]] in the [[University of Cambridge]], and one of the largest astronomy sites in the [[UK]]. Around 180 academics, postdocs, visitors and assistant staff work at the department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/history/ The Institute of Astronomy: Past and Present] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022031130/http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/history/ |date=2007-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research at the department is made in a number of scientific areas, including [[exoplanets]], [[star]]s, star clusters, [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[gravitational-wave astronomy]], the high-[[redshift]] universe, [[Active Galactic Nucleus|AGN]], [[galaxies]] and [[galaxy clusters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/research The Institute of Astronomy: Research]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a mixture of observational astronomy, over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, computational theoretical astronomy, and analytic theoretical research.

The [[Kavli Institute for Cosmology]] is also located on the department site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/kavli/ The Institute of Astronomy: Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Cambridge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925074243/http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/kavli/ |date=2007-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This Institute has an emphasis on ''The Universe at High Redshifts''. The [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group]] are based in the Battcock Centre, a building in the same grounds.

== History ==

[[Image:IoA-Cambridge-Hoyle-Evening.jpg|thumb|right|Institute of Astronomy Hoyle Building in the evening]]

The Institute was formed in 1972 from the amalgamation of earlier institutions:
* The University Observatory, founded in 1823. Its [[Cambridge Observatory]] building now houses offices and the department library.
* The Solar Physics Observatory, which started in Cambridge in 1912. The building was partly demolished in 2008 to make way for the [[Fred_Kavli#Kavli_Institutes|Kavli Institute]] for Cosmology.
* The Institute of Theoretical Astronomy, which was created by [[Fred Hoyle]] in 1967. Its building is the main departmental site (the Hoyle Building), with a lecture theatre added in 1999, and a second two-storey wing built in 2002.

== Teaching ==
The department teaches 3rd and 4th year undergraduates as part of the [[Natural Sciences Tripos]] or [[Mathematical Tripos]]. In addition, there are around 12 to 18 graduate [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] and [[Master's degree|masters]] students at the department per year, mainly funded by the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|STFC]]. The graduate programme is particularly unusual in the UK as the students are free to choose their own PhD supervisor or adviser from the staff at the department, and this choice is often made as late as the end of their first term.

== Notable current staff ==
A (incomplete) list of notable current members of the department.

[[Image:Cambridge_University_Institute_of_Astronomy_observatories.jpg|thumb|Observatory buildings containing the Northumberland Telescope (left) and Thorrowgood Telescope (right) at the Institute of Astronomy of the University of Cambridge. Covered structures in the foreground are mounts for portable telescopes.]]
The Institute houses several telescopes on its site. Although some scientific work is done with the telescopes, they are mostly used for public observing and astronomical societies. The poor weather and light-pollution in Cambridge makes most modern astronomy difficult. The telescopes on the site include:
* The [http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/about/northumberland.telescope Northumberland Telescope] donated by the Duke of Northumberland in 1833. This is a {{convert|12|in|mm|sing=on}} diameter refractor on an English mount.
* The smaller [http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/about/thorrowgood.telescope Thorrowgood Telescope], on extended loan from the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]. The telescope is an {{convert|8|in|mm|sing=on}} refractor.
* The [http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/about/36-inch.telescope 36-inch Telescope], built in 1951.
* The [http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/about/three-mirror.telescope Three-Mirror Telescope], which is a prototype telescope with a unique design to have wide field of view, sharp images and all-reflection optics.

The Institute's former 24" Schmidt Camera was donated to the Spaceguard Centre in June 2009.

The Cambridge University Astronomical Society&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srcf.ucam.org/astronomy/ Cambridge University Astronomical Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (CUAS) and Cambridge Astronomical Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caa-cya.org/ CAA Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (CAA) both regularly observe. The Institute holds public observing evenings on Wednesdays from October to March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/public/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public activities ==
[[Image:Cambridge_University_Institute_of_Astronomy_36_in_telescope.jpg|thumb|The 36-inch telescope being used for the 2011 Cambridge Astronomy Association ''Introduction to Astronomy'' course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomylog.co.uk/2008/05/19/introduction-to-astronomy-week-4/ Introduction to Astronomy – Week 4]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The department holds a number of events involving the general public in astronomy. These include/ have included:
* Open evenings on Wednesdays during the winter, from October to March, with a talk given by a member of the Institute followed by observing in clear weather &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/public/public_observing/ Institute of Astronomy » Public Activities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Library ==
The Institute library is housed in the old [[Cambridge Observatory]] building.  It is a specialist library concentrating on the subjects of astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology.  The collection has approximately 17,000 books and subscribes to about 80 current journals.  The Library also has a collection of rare astronomical books, many of which belonged to [[John Couch Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurn, M. "An English Astronomical Library: the case of the Cambridge Observatory" [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004Obs...124...37H  The Observatory, Vol. 124, No. 1178, pp. 37-46 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==
Among the significant contributions to astronomy made by the institute, the now decommissioned Automatic Plate Measuring (APM) machine was used to create a major catalogue of astronomical objects in the northern sky. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Irwin|first=Mike|title=Overview of the APM Facility|url=http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~mike/casu/apm/apm_intro.html|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10285">'''Integrated Engineering''' is a multi-disciplinary, design-project-based engineering degree program.

Integrated Engineering is a program created to meet the demand for engineers skilled in various disciplines, combining aspects from traditional engineering studies and liberal arts. The demand arises from the current state of industry, where both the products manufactured and the plants which make the products are progressing towards greater diversity and sophistication. Recent studies had shown concern in both [[Canada]] and in the [[United States]] that engineering graduates were not well-prepared for many of today's multi-disciplinary and project-based workplaces. Several committees have been formed to study this and  have published some material. One Canadian study was done by the [[Canadian Academy of Engineering]] and two of its main conclusions were:

* Engineering faculties should ensure that breadth of learning, beyond the technical aspects of the specialist engineering discipline, is a major thrust in engineering education.
* The engineering curriculum should emphasize problem-solving, design, and the development of the learning skills of their students.

Integrated Engineers acquire background in core disciplines such as: [[materials science|materials]], [[solid mechanics]], [[fluid mechanics]], and [[systems]] involving [[chemical]], [[electro-mechanical]], and [[biology|biological]] components.

==Academia and Accreditation==

===Institutions===
Currently, the following academic institutions are known to offer Integrated Engineering programs:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Canada
*[[University of British Columbia]]
*[[University of Western Ontario]]

UK
*[[University of Bath]]
*[[University of Cardiff]]
*[[University of Liverpool]]
*[[University of Nottingham]]
*[[Anglia Ruskin University]]
*[[University Centre Peterborough]]

United States
*[[Lehigh University]]
*[[Southern Utah University]]
*[[Minnesota State University, Mankato]]

Germany
* [http://www.dhbw.de Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW)]

Estonia
*[[Tallinn University of Technology]]

Korea
*[[Chung-Ang University]]

Trinidad and Tobago
*[[University of Trinidad and Tobago]]

===Canada===
Integrated Engineering originated at the [[University of Western Ontario]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] and in 2000 the [[Applied Science]] Faculty of the [[University of British Columbia]] also began a degree program for Integrated Engineering.

In Canada, the program has been fully accredited by the [[Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board]] and engineers are able to obtain a [[Professional Engineer]] (P.Eng) Certificate.

===United Kingdom===
In 1988, the Engineering Council UK, identified the need for routes to qualification for Chartered (Professional) Engineers that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
meet the identified needs of industry,
increase access to engineering education by more students,
provide a balanced curriculum combining the subjects that engineers use most often and directed towards the needs of the majority of engineers.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is the fundamental definition for Integrated Engineering.

The qualities looked for by industry when recruiting graduates were identified as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
flexibility and broad education,
ability to understand non engineering functions,
ability to solve problems,
knowledge of the principles of engineering and ability to apply them in practical situations,
information skills,
experience of project work, especially cross linked projects,
ability to work as a member of a team,
presentation and communication skills.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Engineering Council UK, 1988, An Integrated Engineering Degree Programme.
Engineering Council UK, 1988, Admissions to Universities - Action to increase the supply of engineers.''

Following open competition for additional funding provided by the UK Department for Technology and Industry, and industrial supporters including British Petroleum, six universities were selected from thirty three applicants.  Four "Pilot Programmes" were launched at Cardiff University, Nottingham Trent University, Portsmouth University and Sheffield Hallam University.

In 1989, The Nottingham Trent University (UK) admitted students to first of the Engineering Council's new Integrated Engineering Degree Programme courses.  The course was accredited, at the CEng and European Engineer level, by the Institutions of Mechanical Engineers, Electrical Engineers and Manufacturing Engineers.

Generic engineering programmes are common.  Integrated Engineering is distinct through emphasizing the development of personal competencies, especially the ability of students to work within groups.  It is design led, and integration of all the subjects of study is a defining characteristic, achieved partly through the medium of project based learning.

Following the successful experience at The Nottingham Trent University, Integrated Engineering programmes were established in 1993, at selected universities in Bulgaria and Hungary, with the aid of European Union funding granted under the Tempus Programme.

In [[University of Liverpool]], the Integrated Engineering Program is accredited by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] and the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]], and can lead to [[Chartered Engineer]] status.

In [[Anglia Ruskin University]], the Integrated Engineering Program is accredited by the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]], and can lead to [[Incorporated Engineer]] status.

===United States===
In the U.S. there are several Integrated engineering education programs.

[[Southern Utah University]] requires its students to pass the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]] (FE) before they graduate; and received ABET accreditation in 2004 that extended retroactively through October 2003. The graduates are also able to obtain a [[Professional Engineer]] (P.E.) license.

[[Minnesota State University, Mankato]] has developed a collaborative Integrated engineering program to provide engineering education at MNSCU Community Colleges in the Northern Higher Education District in former [[Iron Range]] communities. This partnership allows students to stay near home, while earning a bachelor of science in integrated engineering while focusing on local engineering needs of manufacturers and businesses. As part of the program students are also required to sit for the FE examination prior to graduation and are eligible to sit for the P.E. exam license as the program is also ABET accredited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cset.mnsu.edu/ie/ |title=Integrated Engineering - Iron Range Engineering|author=Minnesota State|publisher= |access-date=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In Germany the [([http://www.dhbw.de Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW)])] introduced a flexible M.Eng. program in 2015, to fit to the industrial demand for generally educated engineers for Integrated Industry, known as Industry 4.0 in Germany. The graduated school program [http://141.31.235.70/integratedengineering/ "Integrated Engineering"] is administered at the [http://www.cas.dhbw.de Center for Advances Studies] in Heilbronn and requires at least two years professional experience as an engineer for admission.

===Korea===
In Korea the Department of Integrative Engineering at [[Chung-Ang University]] aims to develop human resources that will contribute to building a knowledge infrastructure by effectively responding to rapid educational and social changes.

The department will focus on developing fundamental and application technologies by realizing future-oriented converging technologies and, through a global network, on strengthening convergence-related competitiveness at the university and national level. To accomplish the goals, based on imaginative education using an innovative system, the department will develop “integrative engineering” people who are equipped with initiative research abilities.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
The Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.S.c) and Master of Engineering (M.Eng) programs in Utilities Engineering was validated in December 2008 at the University of Trinidad and Tobago. These programs are geared towards the Electrical and Mechanical engineering disciplines that exist within the broad area of Integrated Engineering.

Prior to the introduction of the programs most of the engineers in the utilities sector were specialized in one branch of engineering mainly Electrical or Mechanical. The sector required an engineer who was multi-skilled and versed in both disciplines. The Utilities Engineer therefore performs a wide range of maintenance and operational duties in the following industries:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Process Industry,
Electric Utilities (generation, distribution and efficient utilization),
Transportation Industry,
Processing and Manufacturing Industry,
Water and sanitation industry,
Mining and Smelting Industry,
Renewable and Green Energy Industry.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Johannes Buxtorf.gif|thumb|right|200px|Johannes Buxtorf]]
'''Johannes Buxtorf'''&lt;ref&gt;also spelled as '''Buxtorff''' in the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] Quarterly Statement for 1894&lt;/ref&gt; (December 25, 1564{{snd}}September 13, 1629) was a celebrated [[Hebraist]], member of a family of [[oriental studies|Orientalist]]s; professor of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for thirty-nine years at [[Basel]] and was known by the title, "Master of the [[Rabbi]]s".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} His massive tome, ''De Synagoga Judaica'' (1st. ed. 1603), scrupulously documents the customs and society of [[German Jewry]] in the early modern period.

Buxtorf was the father of [[Johannes Buxtorf II|Johannes Buxtorf the Younger]].

==Life==

Buxtorf was born at [[Kamen]] in [[Westphalia]]. The original form of the name was Bockstrop, or Boxtrop, from which was derived the family crest, which bore the figure of a goat (Ger. Bock, he-goat). After the death of his father, who was minister of Kamen, Buxtorf studied at Marburg and the newly founded [[Herborn Academy]], at the latter of which [[Caspar Olevian]] (1536–1587) and [[Johannes Piscator]] (1546–1625) had been appointed professors of theology. At a later date Piscator received the assistance of Buxtorf in the preparation of his Latin translation of the Old Testament, published at Herborn in 1602-1603. From Herborn Buxtorf went to Heidelberg, and thence to Basel, attracted by the reputation of [[Johann Jakob Grynaeus]] and [[J. G. Hospinian]] (1515–1575).&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Buxtorf, Johannes (1564-1629)|display=Buxtorf, Johannes|volume=4|pages=893-894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short residence at Basel, he studied successively under [[Heinrich Bullinger]] (1504–1575) at Zürich and [[Theodore Beza]] at Geneva. On his return to Basel, Grynaeus, desirous that the services of so promising a scholar should be secured to the university, procured him a situation as tutor in the family of Leo Curio, son of [[Celio Secondo Curione]], well known for his sufferings on account of the Reformed faith. At the insistence of Grynaeus, Buxtorf undertook the duties of the Hebrew chair in the university, and discharged them for two years with such ability that at the end of that time he was unanimously appointed to the vacant office. From this date (1591) to his death in 1629 he remained in Basel, and devoted himself with remarkable zeal to the study of Hebrew and rabbinic literature. He received into his house many learned Jews, that he might discuss his difficulties with them, and he was frequently consulted by Jews themselves on matters relating to their ceremonial law. He seems to have well deserved the title which was conferred upon him of "Master of the Rabbins." His partiality for Jewish society brought him, indeed, on one occasion into trouble with the authorities of the city, the laws against the Jews being very strict. Nevertheless, on the whole, his relations with the city of Basel were friendly. He remained firmly attached to the university which first recognized his merits, and declined two invitations from the [[University of Leiden]] and [[Academy of Saumur]] successively. His correspondence with the most distinguished scholars of the day was very extensive; the library of the university of Basel contains a rich collection of letters, which are valuable for a literary history of the time.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

* '''Tiberias, sive Commentarius Masoreticus''' (1620; quarto edition, improved and enlarged by J. Buxtorf the younger, 1665), so named from the great school of Jewish criticism which had its seat in the town of [[Tiberias]]. It was in this work that Buxtorf controverted the views of [[Elia Levita|Elias Levita]] regarding the late origin of the Hebrew vowel points, a subject which gave rise to the controversy between [[Louis Cappel]] and his son [[Johannes Buxtorf II]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Buxtorf did not live to complete the two works on which his reputation chiefly rests, his ''Lexicon Chaldaicum, Talmudicum, et Rabbinicum'', and the ''Concordantiae Bibliorum Hebraicorum'', both of which were edited by his son. The lexicon was republished at Leipzig in 1869 with some additions by [[Bernard Fischer]], and the concordance was assumed by [[Julius Fürst]] as the basis of his own Hebrew concordance, which appeared in 1840.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; [[File:Buxtorf_Concordance_Basel_1632.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece of Buxtorf's concordance, Basel, 1632]]

[[Wilhelm Gesenius]] wrote in 1815 that he considered Buxtorf's Hebrew grammar the best yet written.&lt;ref&gt;Steven W. Holloway, ed., ''Orientalism, Assyriology and the Bible'', Hebrew Bible Monographs, 10; Sheffield Phoenix Press, 2006; {{ISBN|978-1-905048-37-3}}; p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7807">'''Microbial population biology''' is the application of the principles of [[population biology]] to [[microorganisms]].

==Distinguishing from other biological disciplines==
Microbial population biology, in practice, is the application of [[population ecology]] and [[population genetics]] toward understanding the [[ecology]] and [[evolution]] of [[bacteria]], [[archaebacteria]], [[microscopic]] [[fungi]] (such as [[yeasts]]), additional microscopic [[eukaryotes]] (e.g., "[[protozoa]]" and  [[algae]]), and [[viruses]].

Microbial population biology also encompasses the evolution and ecology of community interactions ([[community ecology]]) between microorganisms, including microbial [[coevolution]] and [[predator-prey interaction]]s. In addition, microbial population biology considers microbial interactions with more macroscopic [[organism]]s (e.g., [[host (biology)|host]]-[[parasite]] interactions), though strictly this should be more from the perspective of the microscopic rather than the macroscopic organism. A good deal of microbial population biology may be described also as microbial [[evolutionary ecology]]. On the other hand, typically microbial population biologists (unlike [[microbial ecology|microbial ecologists]]) are less concerned with questions of the role of microorganisms in [[ecosystem ecology]], which is the study of [[nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]] and [[energy flow (ecology)|energy movement]] between biotic as well as abiotic components of ecosystems.

Microbial population biology can include aspects of [[molecular evolution]] or [[phylogenetics]]. Strictly, however, these emphases should be employed toward understanding issues of microbial evolution and ecology rather than as a means of understanding more universal truths applicable to both microscopic and macroscopic organisms. The microorganisms in such endeavors consequently should be recognized as organisms rather than simply as molecular or evolutionary [[reductionism|reductionist]] model systems. Thus, the study of RNA  ''[[in vitro]]'' evolution is not microbial population biology and nor is the ''[[in silico]]'' generation of phylogenies of otherwise non-microbial sequences, even if aspects of either may in some (especially unintentional) manner be analogous to evolution in actual microbial populations.

Microbial population biology can (and often does) involve the testing of more-general ecological and evolutionary hypotheses. Again, it is important to retain some emphasis on the microbe since at some point this "question-driven" microbial population biology becomes instead population biology using microorganisms. Because the point of departure of these potentially disparate emphases can be somewhat arbitrary, there exist vague and not universally accepted delimits around what the discipline of microbial population biology does and does not constitute.

== Microbial Population Biology Gordon conference ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Phage meetings]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;

A Microbial Population Biology [[Gordon Research Conferences|Gordon Research Conference]] is held every odd year, to date in New England (and usually in New Hampshire). The 2007 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060928083124/http://www.grc.org/programs/2007/micrpop.htm conference web page] introduces the meetings as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Microbial Population Biology covers a diverse range of cutting edge issues in the microbial sciences and beyond. Firmly founded in evolutionary biology and with a strongly integrative approach, past meetings have covered topics ranging from the dynamics and genetics of adaptation to the evolution of mutation rate, community ecology, evolutionary genomics, altruism, and epidemiology.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This meeting is never dull: some of the most significant and contentious issues in biology have been thrashed out here.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A history of the meeting can be found [http://www.grc.org/conferences.aspx?id=0000228 here].

The next Microbial Population Biology Gordon conference is scheduled for 2011. Information on past (and future) meetings is summarized as follows:

{{globalize|date=July 2018}}
A '''museum label''' or caption is a [[label]] describing an object exhibited in a [[museum]] or one introducing a room or area.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"&gt;[http://www.museumprofessionals.org/forum/member-articles/2424-writing-exhibit-labels.html Writing Exhibit Labels / object labels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430212508/http://www.museumprofessionals.org/forum/member-articles/2424-writing-exhibit-labels.html |date=2011-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="EnduringLabel"&gt;[http://www.archimuse.com/mw2007/papers/parry/parry.html The Enduring Label — How Shall We Label Our Exhibit Today? Applying the Principles of On-Line Publishing to an On-Site Exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of various museum labels==
===Introduction labels===
Kim Kenney, curator of the [[William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum]] says that the first label a visitor should see should explain your exhibit display in general. The introduction label should be a “teaser” and talk about the main sections of your exhibit to encourage people to see the rest. If there is something significant or special of the main exhibit, it should be introduced here. At this point the visitor should have a good feeling what the museum is generally about. Visitors should understand immediately what they are going to see and they should desire to want to see the entire exhibit. Perhaps a brochure would accompany the introduction explaining the main museum, the price, and the hours.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"/&gt;

=== Section labels ===
A section label is a small introduction. It consists of sub-topics in a museum exhibition. Kenney says they should represent the "meat" of the museum. If the section is large, perhaps more than one section label is in order. The description should consist of 100-200 words or thereabouts. The visitor should not be strained to read all the labels, so they should be on the short side if anything.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"/&gt;

===Object labels===
[[File:Wayne-Thiebaud---De-Young-1 label.jpg|thumb||An object label at the [[de Young Museum]]]]
[[File:Thomas Cole NHS 34.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A decorative museum label at the [[Thomas Cole National Historic Site]]]]
Object labels are the smallest. They just describe the individual object they are displayed next to. Typically the title of the work or a descriptive title phrase is given, followed by the date and place of creation, and the materials or technique of the object. Increasingly, there may be a brief description or commentary. An accession number is often given, and often the accession date. If the object is included in an [[audio guide]] or some other form of tour, there may be a symbol indicating this. Kenney says she prefers in an object label a one word title followed by a 25–50 word description for a museum label. She explains that people want specific aspects of the object they might not notice at first glance or might not have already known (i.e. something unusual, material made of, date of artifact, who made). Most people want to know specifics like when it was made, why it was made, usage and when it became part of the museum.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"/&gt;

===Credit panel===
Practice varies as to whether accession dates and donor information are included. Some donations, especially from government organizations, may specify a credit on the label. Loaned objects are usually specified in some way. It is the opinion of Kenney that donor information clutters up the object label. She believes it is better to give a list of donors on a credit panel.&lt;ref Name="objectlabels"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Belshalti-nannar's museum label.jpg|thumb|upright|The first known museum label]]
The first known museum labels are from the [[Ennigaldi-Nanna's museum]] originally dating to circa 530 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, ''Excavations at Ur: a record of twelve years' work.'', p. 238 ''The room was a museum of local antiquities maintained by the princess Belshalti-Nannar, and in the collection was this clay drum, the earliest museum label known...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Casey"&gt;Casey, p. "First Public Museum" ''Around 530 B.C.E. in Ur, an educational museum containing a collection of labeled antiquities was founded by Ennigaldi-Nannathe, daughter of Nabonidus, the last king of Babylonia.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum labels of the 20th century and 21st century BCE items found in Ennigaldi's museum were labeled in three different languages on clay cylinders as to what the centuries old objects were.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uv.es/EBRIT/macro/macro_5004_43_1.html THE PRECURSORS OF MUSEUMS]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leon, p. 36 ''When archaeologists excavated certain parts of the palace and temple complex at Ur, they were puzzled to find dozens of artifacts, neatly arranged side by side whose ages varied by hundreds of years. Then clay drums with labels in three languages showed up — the first known museum labels.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Woolley"&gt;Woolley, ''Ur of the Chaldees'' pp. 252–259&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these artifacts were:
* a [[kudurru]], Kassite boundary marker (carved with a snake and emblems of various gods).
* part of a statue of King [[Shulgi]].
* clay cone that was part of a building at [[Larsa]].&lt;ref Name="Casey"/&gt;

Museum-like behavior occurred as early as the 19th-century BCE which gave indications of steps of labeling and cataloging antiquities.&lt;ref Name="Woolley236"&gt;Woolley, Excavations at Ur: a record of twelve years' work., p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001410/141067e.pdf The Role of Museums and the Professional Code of Ethics], p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
A "museum label" cylinder tablet describing 100-year-old antiquity objects of circa 2000 BCE read,{{cquote|These are copies from bricks found in the ruins of Ur, the work of [[Bur-Sin]] of Ur, which while searching for the groundplan (of the temple) the Governor of Ur found, and I saw and wrote out for the marvel of the beholder.''&lt;ref Name="Woolley236"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/alumni.magazine/issue14/14_feature_montebello.html Former Met director—and first-time professor—Philippe de Montebello takes the podium to explain how collectors have anointed “art” through the ages] '' An excavation at the ancient Sumerian city of Ur, in modern-day Iraq, found what is considered the oldest museum label: a 19th-century BCE tablet describing an object, then 100 years old, presented, as it read, “...for the marvel of the beholder.”''&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Future==
There are studies recently done that demonstrate the feasibility of a wireless Web-based tool for an in-gallery paperless digital label system, perhaps in the form of "Digital Label Towers" or wall mounted digital displays. Some concepts that could be used then is changing configurations of the museum labels, digitally updating the electronic museum label, usability on various display systems, and integrate third party content.&lt;ref Name="EnduringLabel"/&gt; 

Other advanced digital technology used by some museums is the use of [[barcode]]s on their museum labels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001410/141067e.pdf Running a Museum: A Practical Handbook], p. 30 describes bar codes in "museum labels".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bay Adelaide first tower nearing completion - cropped.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Bay Adelaide Centre]] in Toronto. When first proposed in the 1980s the building had a strongly postmodernist design. The final design, completed in 2009, adopted the neomodern style.]]

'''Neomodern''' or '''neomodernist''' art is a reaction to the complexity of [[postmodern architecture]] and [[eclecticism]], seeking greater simplicity.

==Architecture==
Neomodern architecture continues [[Modern architecture|modernism]] as a dominant form of architecture in the 20th and 21st centuries, especially in corporate offices. It tends to be used for certain segments of buildings. Many residential houses tend to embrace [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]], [[New Classical Architecture|new classical]] and [[neo-eclectic]] styles, for instance, and major monuments today most often opt for [[starchitect]] inspired uniqueness. 
Neomodern architecture shares many of the basic characteristics of modernism. Both reject classical ornamentation, decorations, and deliberate ambitions to continue pre-modernist traditions. Neomodernist buildings, like modernist ones, are designed to be largely monolithic and functional.

The neomodern artist group was founded in 1997 by [[Guy Denning]]&lt;ref name=sherwin&gt;Sherwin, Brian. [http://www.myartspace.com/blog/2006/11/art-space-talk-guy-denning.html "Art Space Talk: Guy Denning"], myartspace.com, 14 November 2006. Retrieved 31 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; on the premise that the diversity of contemporary art was being stifled by the state supported art institutions and organisations. The group have no common style or media but there is a bias towards figurative painting. Original artists listed: [[James Butler (artist)|Jim Butler]], [[David Cobley]], [[Emily Cole]], [[Mark Demsteader]], [[Guy Denning]], [[Ian Francis]], [[Juno Doran]], [[Ghislaine Howard]], [[David Jamin (artist)|Jamin]], [[Maya Kulenovic]], [[Mark Stephen Meadows]], [[Antony Micallef]], [[Motorboy]], [[Carol Peace]], [[Graeme Robbins]], [[Harry Simmonds]], [[Tom Wilmott]], [[Franklin Torres]], [[Kit Wise]] and [[Claire Zakiewicz]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2596">'''Nouvelle Tendance''' (New Tendency) was an art movement founded in Yugoslavia in 1961. The "theoretician"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Frank|title=Origins and development of kinetic art|year=1968|publisher=New York Graphic Society|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the group was Serbian art critic [[Marko Mestrovich]]. The other original founders of Nouvelle Tendance were Brazilian painter [[Almir Mavignier]], and [[Bozo Bek]], the Croatian director of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Amy|title=Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art|year=2010|publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]]|isbn=9780500288443|pages=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Nouvelle Tendance was more accurately a reflection of common approaches used by artists in a variety of simultaneous movements worldwide, such as [[Concrete art]], [[Kinetic art]], and [[Op Art]]. The main consideration of the movement has been described as the "problem of movement as conveyed through repetition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Frank|title=Origins and development of kinetic art|year=1968|publisher=New York Graphic Society|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "sensation of displeasure" is provoked in some Nouvelle Tendance works, to "stimulate a more active field of vision" and interest the spectator in an "auto-creative process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Frank|title=Origins and development of kinetic art|year=1968|publisher=New York Graphic Society|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinct self-identified groups of artists who became associated with Nouvelle Tendance included GRAV, Gruppo T, Gruppo N, and Zero. The movement attracted artists from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain. International artists participated in a series of exhibits at European galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Amy|title=Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art|year=2010|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=9780500288443|pages=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This group should not be confused with an early 20th century circle of Paris-based artists who operated briefly under the name "Tendances nouvelles" and held an exhibition in 1904; founding members included [[Alice Dannenberg]] and [[Martha Stettler]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gil Blas'', April 13, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus''''' is a [[Platform game|platform video game]] developed by [[Oddworld Inhabitants]] and published by [[GT Interactive]]. Although the game is a sequel to the video game ''[[Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee]]'', it is considered a spin-off title in the ''Oddworld'' series, and not part of the main ''[[Oddworld|Oddworld Quintology]]''. It was released in November 1998 for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] [[video game console]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref name="FactSheet"&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|title=Oddworld Fact Sheet|url=http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/oddworld/company/ow_keyfacts.shtml|work=Oddworld Inhabitants|accessdate=October 6, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216004306/http://oddworld.com/firsttenyears/oddworld/company/ow_keyfacts.shtml|archivedate=December 16, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/action/oddworldabesexoddus/similar.html?mode=versions|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715050244/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/action/oddworldabesexoddus/similar.html?mode=versions|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-15|title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus - Related Games|publisher=[[GameSpot]] UK|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was re-released on the [[PlayStation Network]] in October 2009.

The game continues the story of [[Abe (Oddworld)|Abe]], charting his efforts to save his fellow Mudokons from another plot by the Glukkons to exploit them. Abe discovers that the Glukkons are enslaving Mudokons, this time to produce a drink called Soulstorm Brew, which uses Mudokon bones and tears as its ingredients. The player assumes the role of Abe, embarking on a quest to halt production of SoulStorm Brew.

The game was released to similar critical acclaim as the first title. Reviews praised the game's ability to allow the player to [[Saved game#Save states|quick save]]&lt;!-- a quick save is a common thing, no need for the game's own QuikSave spelling --&gt; anywhere they liked, a feature that was not present in ''Abe's Oddysee'', while noting that it was very similar to that title.&lt;ref name="Review1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lauren Fielder|date=November 25, 1998|title=GameSpot review of Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/action/oddworldabesexoddus/review.html|publisher=GameSpot UK|accessdate=August 4, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214100548/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps/action/oddworldabesexoddus/review.html|archivedate=February 14, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game won multiple awards upon release.&lt;ref name="AwardsList"&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards List for Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus|url=http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/oddworld/company/ow_awards_ae.shtml|work=[[Oddworld Inhabitants]]|accessdate=September 5, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006094518/http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/oddworld/company/ow_awards_ae.shtml|archivedate=October 6, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 14, 2016, it was announced that [[Oddworld Inhabitants]] are working on a follow-up to ''[[Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!]]'' (a 2014 ''Abe's Oddysee'' remake) titled ''[[Oddworld: Soulstorm]]''. The game page confirms that this title is inspired by ''Abe's Exoddus'' and that the new game is going to be a re-tale of ''Abe's Exoddus''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oddworld.com/soulstorm/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Abe's Exoddus'' is a [[two-dimensional]] platform game, with many of its elements taken from the previous title, ''Abe's Oddysee''. The game is split into screens; when the player moves into the edge of the screen, the environment is replaced, just like in the previous title. Most screens include various puzzles that must be solved through the use of Abe's unique abilities: "GameSpeak", possession, controlling mine cars, activation or deactivation of mines or levers, and rocks, grenades, or bones that can be picked up and used for different purposes. Normal abilities include creeping, walking, running, rolling, hoisting, jumping, and crouching, all of which have specific application and make up a necessary arsenal of moves.

The game features no [[graphical user interface|user interface]] or [[HUD (computer gaming)|heads-up display]]. Information is conveyed to the player through instructive screens that can be activated by the player character, or through scrolling messages in the background. Characters do not have [[hit point]]s; instead, being attacked (such as being shot or mauled) generally causes instant death. However, the player has unlimited lives, and upon death will [[Spawn point|re-spawn]] at the last [[Save point|checkpoint]] they reached. ''Abe's Exoddus'' includes an option to [[Saved game#Save states|quick save]]&lt;!-- a quick save is a common thing, no need for the game's own QuikSave spelling --&gt; which allows the player to designate their own checkpoints, a feature which was not present in ''Abe's Oddysee'' due to programming conflicts and which attracted criticism of that title.&lt;ref name="GOGEditorial"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Craddock |date=December 29, 2008 |title=GOG.com Editorial of Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus |url=http://www.gog.com/news/editorial_oddworld_abes_exoddus |work=GOG.com |accessdate=November 17, 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122093946/http://www.gog.com/news/editorial_oddworld_abes_exoddus |archivedate=January 22, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the focus of the gameplay is surmounting screens, there is a secondary focus on rescuing enslaved Mudokons. GameSpeak is a pivotal ability in this respect; by pressing combinations of buttons, the player character will utter short phrases that can be used to control allied [[non-player character]]s—to pull extra levers, to follow the player character,or simply to wait.

[[Image:AbesExoddusScreen1.jpg|thumb|left|Abe and some Mudokons sneak past a sleeping Slig.]]

Unlike the first game, Mudokons have emotional states and status ailments that affect how they respond to Abe. Mudokons may be angry, wired, [[Depression (mood)|depressed]], sick, or blind, and each state must be dealt with differently by the player. Angry, wired or depressed characters can be consoled through specific GameSpeak commands. An "angry" Mudokon (red) will either repeatedly slap nearby Mudokons or work dangerous traps and can be told to "stop it" though Abe must tell them he is "sorry" to calm them down. If a "depressed" Mudokon (blue) witnesses too many deaths of other Mudokons or if he is slapped, he will start to hit himself in the head and eventually commit suicide. Abe again can prevent this by saying "stop it" and remove the ailment by telling them he's "sorry". Both angry and depressed Mudokons will not follow Abe if he tells them to. Clouds of laughing gas will turn Mudokons "wired" (lime), causing them to hyperactively run in Abe's direction and in some cases make it harder to get past enemies and obstacles. They will only calm down when slapped but the slap will have no effect if done within the gas cloud. "Sick" Mudokons will not respond to any GameSpeak command whatsoever (aside from being slapped) and can only be cured with a special chant, obtained when Abe finds a helper character. Blind Mudokons (distinguished by pale skin and with their eyes sewn shut) will keep walking in the direction of Abe's voice, and must be told to "wait" before they walk into a hazard.

[[Spiritual possession|Possession]] is the player character's ability to take control of certain characters in the same screen by chanting. When a character is possessed, the player can use their abilities and weapons to find otherwise unreachable areas or levers, kill enemies, or as part of solving puzzles. However, when possessing a character, the player character remains immobile and vulnerable to attack. Possessing a slig in particular sometimes has to use voice commands to solve puzzles. This is done with an "Ackack!" which the game refers to as 'BS' "Ay!" which is referred to in the game as 'S'BS' and a laugh. The whistling passwords have been removed from the previous game.

The player can abandon possession of a creature at any time. Scrabs or Paramites will be released without harm when abandoned, while Industrialists (Sligs and Glukkons) will burst into pieces. If the player character has drunk Soulstorm Brew, they will be able to possess their own [[flatulence|fart]], which can then be used as a flying explosive and will detonate either when control is abandoned, or after a period of time.

Slave Mudokons (including blind ones) are rescued through Bird Portals. If the player character chants when in the same screen as a Bird Portal, the portal will activate, and any nearby Mudokon slaves will run through it, disappearing. Rescuing Mudokons is not usually crucial to progressing through the game; however, rescuing at least 150 is necessary to get the good ending, and many secret areas revolve around rescuing a few Mudokons in particularly complex situations. There is an alternative ending known as the 'Maximum Casualties' ending. If the player kills all 278 Mudokons, the player is awarded with invincibility.

The player can also gain the ability to turn into the Shrykull, a Mudokon supernatural demigod. Abe acquired this power at a late stage in ''Abe's Oddysee''. The ability is earned by sending a certain number of Mudokons through a bird portal at once, denoted by a number circulating with the birds. With the ability, the player can enter a screen with enemies or explosives, chant to transform into the Shrykull, and vaporize all enemies and hazards on the screen. Afterward, the player character turns back into Mudokon form. Achieving the ability and doing such is necessary to get past certain points in the game. The player can only turn into the Shrykull once each time they earn the ability, so where and when they choose to use it is important.&lt;ref name="GOGEditorial"/&gt;

===Allies, enemies and wildlife===
Allies in the game include Mudokons, humanoid species encountered as rescuable slaves and helpers. Normally, they will follow any GameSpeak-given order, but as described above, some Mudokons will be emotional and must be consoled by the player character first. The player character can also possess other creatures, in order to gain help with a task. For example, when possessing a [[Paramite]], the player character can use GameSpeak to communicate with other Paramites, in much the same way as Mudokons. Scrabs also have minor abilities of GameSpeak, but are limited to shrilling, which activates the ability to attack.

Enemies in the game primarily consist of Sligs, semi-robotic creatures who will attempt to kill the player character on sight. Although most have mechanical legs and carry [[machine gun]]s, some Sligs wear helicopter flight packs and launch [[grenade]]s. Some Sligs choose to sleep without wearing mechanical legs, in which case they are vulnerable until they can obtain a set. Sligs can be possessed by the player character, who can then control the Slig and utilize its weapon. Sligs cannot see in dark shadows, which create natural hiding places for the player character. Sligs are often accompanied by Slogs, bipedal dog-like creatures that chase and attack the player character on sight. Slogs can be commanded if the player possesses a Slig, and can be ordered to attack and kill enemies. Sloggies are the puppy form of Slogs, and are slower but just as deadly if the player character encounters them. Slogs and Sloggies can be distracted with bones.

Other enemies include Greeters, robotic security guards originally designed for public speaking and advertising, until they began to attack their customers. Greeters have [[motion sensor|motion detectors]], and if the player character or another Mudokon triggers a Greeter's detector, the Greeter will give chase and attempt to kill the victim with an electric charge.

Glukkons feature as the game's primary antagonists. Glukkons are tall-foreheaded, humanoid creatures who are ruthless, malevolent businessmen. They walk on their arms as their feet are located upon their chest, and as a result they are physically defenseless and rely on Sligs to protect and serve them. They are the owners and bosses of the industries Abe visits throughout the game, and the masters of the Mudokon and Slig slaves. Glukkons can be possessed by the player, and can be made to command Sligs through GameSpeak, either to kill other characters, or to pull levers and move platforms.

Animals and wildlife consist of the [[Scrab]]s and aforementioned Paramites, both [[carnivore|carnivorous]] predators that are encountered in the burial vaults of Necrum. Scrabs are highly territorial and chase any other life form on sight. Should they encounter another Scrab, a short fight ensues in which one is killed. Paramites are [[pack hunter]]s, and when the player encounters a single Paramite, the Paramite will flee and not attack the player unless they are cornered. When encountered in groups of two or more, Paramites will pursue and attack the player. Paramites can be distracted with chunks of meat.

Other wildlife include the Fleeches, worm-like creatures that live in the Oddworld underworld. When woken from sleep, they will chase the player character and any other Mudokons, attacking with their long tongues before swallowing the victim whole. Fleeches fear Scrabs and Paramites and try to avoid them whenever possible. Fleeches are the only enemy that cannot kill Abe in one hit and it is possible to run away from Fleeches while they are attacking before they hit Abe enough to kill him, They are also the only enemies that can navigate up platform edges. Slurgs, the lowest form of life on Oddworld, are often found alongside Fleeches, as when stepped on by the player character, Slurgs emit a noise that wakes Fleeches from sleep. They can also be eaten by possessed Paramites without disturbing any nearby sleeping Fleeches

==Story==
[[Image:Oddworld Mudokons.jpg|thumb|Abe's friends retaliating against him, before they get sick.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"His scarred hand branded on moon's odd face, this hero may free the Mudokon race. With skin of blue and spirit guides too, only he can save our bones from brew. But shall he fall to Glukkon yoke, Mudokon nation... BE DOOMED TO CROAK."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The events of ''Abe's Exoddus'' follow on immediately from [[Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee#Story|the events of ''Abe's Oddysee'']], beginning with the protagonist standing in front of a cheering crowd having saved 99 of his brethren from RuptureFarms. Abe falls from the stage, and loses consciousness; whereupon three Mudokon spirits known as the Weirdos inform Abe that the Glukkons are using Mudokon slaves to [[exhumation|exhume]] Mudokon bones at Necrum, the burial grounds of the ancient Mudokons.&lt;ref name="Overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee|url=http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/games/ow_abeexo.shtml|work=Oddworld Inhabitants|accessdate=September 5, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216042559/http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/games/ow_abeexo.shtml|archivedate=December 16, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abe and five friends (including an individual named Alf) cross the deserts of Oddworld, and infiltrate Necrum Mines, where Abe is separated from his friends.

Abe explores the mines and is reunited with his friends; but they drink an excess of an Industrial drink called Soulstorm Brew and become sick from doing so. Abe then discovers that Soulstorm Brew contains Mudokon bones. At this, Abe overloads the boilers that power Necrum Mines, only just escaping the resulting explosion. Thereafter Abe navigates the jungles and Mudokon [[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]]s of Necrum, liberating trapped Mudokon spirits, until he finds the three Weirdos who told him about Necrum. They ask him to shut down Soulstorm Brewery, which is also exploiting Mudokon slaves, and brand a scar across his chest, which gives Abe the power to heal Mudokons sick from Brew. Having restored his friends, Abe proceeds to the FeeCo Depot, a large railway station and [[transshipment]]/storage area, where he learns that the entrance to Soulstorm Brewery has been sealed by three high-ranking Glukkons. To unseal the entrance, Abe infiltrates a bone processing plant named Bonewerkz, the Slig [[Barracks]], and the FeeCo Executive Office. By possessing all three Glukkon owners in turn, Abe orders the Slig guards to open the main gate of Soulstorm Brewery, and uses a train from the FeeCo Depot to get there. As Abe explores Soulstorm Brewery, he learns that the second ingredient of Soulstorm Brew is Mudokon tears, and that the Glukkons obtain the tears by attaching Mudokon slaves to machines that electrocute them repeatedly. Abe also discovers that he can destroy the brewery by overloading its main boiler and causing an explosion. What happens next depends on how many Mudokons Abe has saved throughout the game.

[[Image:SoulStorm Destruction.jpg|thumb|The destruction of Soulstorm Brewery.]]
*If 150 or more Mudokons are rescued, Abe succeeds in destroying Soulstorm Brewery, and escapes to be greeted by the Mudokons he saved, who then use their skills to build a [[Alcoholics Anonymous|rehabilitation center for Brew addicts]] named "Alf's Rehab &amp; Tea". Abe is called a "terrorist mastermind" by the Magog Cartel, and a hero by his fellow Mudokons who resolve to find and free other enslaved Mudokons (this ending is cut short by a "newscaster" Slig who reports in on the rumor of Abe's destruction of Soulstorm Brewery, reminding the viewers to "stay tuned for more on this story as it develops").&lt;ref&gt;''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' "Good Ending" FMV movie.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Should the player save less than 150 Mudokons, they will instead receive the Bad Ending. Abe is ganged up on by his friends for not helping the slaves, and he is knocked unconscious. He is attached to a machine used by the brewery for extracting tears, and is killed by an overload of electricity from the machine.&lt;ref&gt;''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' "Bad Ending" FMV movie.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the endings, if the player saves all 300 Mudokons, they are rewarded with a screen that says "Coming in 2000, ''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee''". This screen is followed by another that gives supposed hints to the upcoming release including Abe's long lost mother. This information, however, is presumed to be a part of the original story that was cut since there is no mention of Abe's mother in ''[[Munch's Oddysee]]'' at all. Finally an art gallery showing concept and production art for ''Abe's Exoddus'' will begin playing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

If the player kills every Mudokon, except those that cannot be reached or must be rescued to proceed through the game, they will be returned to the FeeCo Depot with permanent invincibility. This was prevented by a bug in the PC version of the game.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Development==
{{expand section|date=January 2009}}
Following the overwhelming success of ''Abe's Oddysee'', [[GT Interactive]], the publishers of ''Abe's Oddysee'' and ''Abe's Exoddus'', pushed for a sequel to be made by [[Christmas]] 1998. In order to meet this deadline, ''Abe's Exoddus'' was made to run on the same game engine as ''Abe's Oddysee'', and was completed in nine months. [[Lorne Lanning]], the [[game director|director]] of both games, stated that "we killed ourselves getting ''Abe's Exoddus'' done in nine months. It was brutal."&lt;ref name="GOGEditorial"/&gt;

The [[Game Boy Color]] port was released as '''''Oddworld Adventures 2'''''; it was developed by [[Saffire Corporation]] and published by [[GT Interactive]] in November [[1999 in video gaming|1999]]. The game is a significantly cut-down version of ''Abe's Exoddus'', with only a few similar levels and an absence of plot.&lt;ref name="boy1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason White|title=Oddworld Adventures 2|url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&amp;sql=1:20934|publisher=Allgame|accessdate=October 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Video game console emulator|emulated]] version of the PlayStation version was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] via [[PlayStation Network]] on October 22, 2009 in North America and on June 2, 2010 in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.PlayStation.com/2009/10/coming-to-psn-this-week-oddworld-psone-classics|title=Coming to PSN this Week: Oddworld PSone Classics|author=[[Lorne Lanning]]|publisher=PlayStation.blog|date=October 22, 2009|accessdate=October 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.PlayStation.com/2010/06/02/heads-up-PlayStation-store-update-2nd-june-2010/|title=‘Heads-Up’ PlayStation Store Update (2 June 2010)|author=Mike Kebby|publisher=[[PlayStation Network]]|date=June 2, 2010|accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Abe's Exoddus'' received mostly positive reviews upon its release.&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation/oddworld-abes-exoddus |title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2017-11-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117090314/http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation/oddworld-abes-exoddus |archivedate=2017-01-17 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' praised Abe's range of abilities because they can be used in "lateral [and] unrelated" ways, but criticized the general gameplay for being similar to its predecessor.&lt;ref name="Edge review"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Abe's Exoddus |magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |issue=65 |page=93 |date=December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Contrast, [[GameSpot]] stated, "though the ''Exoddus'' gameplay is essentially more of the same, it's more of a good thing".&lt;ref name="GSpot review"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oddworld-abes-exoddus-review/1900-2545915/ |title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus Review |author=Lauren Fielder |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=1998-11-25 |accessdate=2017-11-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022073529/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/oddworld-abes-exoddus-review/1900-2545915/ |archivedate=2013-10-22 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[PC Zone]]'' praised the game's cut-scenes, stating that "the cut-scenes are brilliantly created (especially in the sound department)".&lt;ref name="PCZone review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=2688 |title=Abe's |publisher=''[[PC Zone]]'' |date=2001-08-13 |accessdate=2008-02-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209231657/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=2688 |archivedate=2008-02-09 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] gave particular praise to the game's graphics: "The 3D characters are better looking than the previous iteration, and more animated backgrounds and moving parts liven up the slightly old formula".&lt;ref name="IGN review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1998/12/01/oddworld-abes-exoddus |title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus |author=Doug Perry |date=1998-11-30 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2017-01-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130213737/http://www.ign.com/articles/1998/12/01/oddworld-abes-exoddus |archivedate=2017-01-30 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism varied between reviews. GameSpot's sole criticism was of the game's two-player mode, stating that "the waiting game just doesn't parallel the egocentric fun of keeping this title to yourself".&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; ''PC Zone'' focused on the game's difficulty, stating that "it's too f**king hard...You sometimes start to dread moving into a (obviously harder) new area of the game".&lt;ref name="PCZone review"/&gt; IGN criticised [[trial and error]] gameplay, stating that "the same trial-and-error scheme is frustrating as a thorn in your heel. Several areas simply leave you stranded, and you have to start over."&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;

Despite these criticisms, the game won many awards, including the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] Showstopper award from GamePro in 1998, the E3 Best of Show Winners List, the Best Action/Adventure PSX Game award from Next Level Holiday Guide in 1999, and the 1998 Best PSX Adventure Game award from Game Revolution in 1999.&lt;ref name="AwardsList"/&gt; It was nominated for [[CNET|CNET Gamecenter]]'s 1999 "Best Arcade Game" award, which ultimately went to ''[[Rayman 2: The Great Escape]]''.&lt;ref name=gamecenter1999&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000606180348/http://gamecenter.com:80/Features/Exclusives/Awards99/ | url=http://gamecenter.com:80/Features/Exclusives/Awards99/ | title=The Gamecenter Awards for 1999! | author=The Gamecenter Staff | date=January 21, 2000 | archivedate=June 6, 2000 | work=[[CNET|CNET Gamecenter]] | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the computer version of ''Abe's Exoddus'' sold 9,499 copies during 1999.&lt;ref name=pcgsales3&gt;{{cite journal|author=Staff|date=April 2000|volume=7|issue=4|title=''PC Gamer'' Editors' Choice Winners: Does Quality Matter?|journal=[[PC Gamer US]]|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to further market the game Developer Oddworld Inhabitants submitted a 15-minute short film of looped cinematics for the '[[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]]' category of the [[71st Academy Awards]]. The game's cinematics reportedly cost around $2 million to develop, about half of the game's total development budget.&lt;ref name="SPIN"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ayeEJMF-CZUC&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=david%20kushner&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20kushner&amp;f=false | title=Land of the Loops | author=Kushner, David | journal=SPIN | date=May  1999 | volume=15 | issue=5 | pages=73 | ISSN= 0886-3032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the film failed to meet the shortlist CEO of Oddworld Sherry McKenna stated the pioneering move was done in order to increase the video game industry's reputation in the animation field:

==Remake==
On March 14, 2016 it was announced via a press-release that a new game titled ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'' is in development in conjunction with [[Frima Studio]], Sabotage and Fat Kraken Studios and is slated to be released later in 2017,&lt;ref name="soulstormannouncement"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kamen |first1=Matt |title=Oddworld returns in 2017 with mysterious 'Soulstorm' |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/oddworld-soulstorm-gaming-classic-returns |date=March 14, 2016 |publisher=Wired |accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; later delayed to 2019. The game has been described by [[Oddworld Inhabitants]] as "a complete story retake [of ''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus''] inspired by our original tale."&lt;ref name="First images"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/first-oddworld-soulstorm-image-surfaces-415232.phtml |title=First Oddworld: Soulstorm image surfaces |last=Devore |first=Jordan |work=[[Destructoid]] |date=January 27, 2017 |accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the announcement, it was announced in April 2015 that a remake of ''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' was in the planning stages. Lanning said that ''Exoddus''{{'}}s success would contribute significantly to future ''Oddworld'' titles, and would be marketed more broadly than ''[[Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/04/14/oddworld-abes-exoddus-remake-in-the-works/|title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus remake in the works|author=Brenna Hillier|work=[[VG247]]|date=April 14, 2015|accessdate=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the development of ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'', Oddworld Inhabitants have started an [[alternate reality game]] in which they encourage fans to look for clues within files and websites they upload.&lt;ref name="First images" /&gt;

In September 2016 at the [[EGX (expo)|EGX Expo]], Oddworld Inhabitants game designer Matt Glanville said that ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'' is going to be a bigger version of ''Abe's Exoddus''; featuring both areas and game mechanics from ''Exoddus'' as well as entirely new areas. The Quarma system from ''[[Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee]]'' will return and the path that the player takes will depend on the storyline. He also stated that ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'' is a sequel to ''Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty'' and will be what ''Abe's Exoddus'' should have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 23, 2016 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2AcGZd8P5Q |title=The Past and Future of Oddworld |publisher=EGX via YouTube |accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, it was announced that ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'' will have its first showcase at a Unity event in Berlin. It also states that attendees will give a closer look at Lorne Lanning's Studio.&lt;ref name="soulstormpremire"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Premires for Oddworld: Soulstorm, GTFO and More to be Showcased at Unite Berlin|url=https://wccftech.com/premiere-oddworld-soulstorm-unite-berlin/|website=wccftech|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19th 2018, a video was released during a conference which [[Oddworld Inhabitants]] uploaded to their YouTube channel titled Oddworld Video Showcase at Unite Berlin 2018. In this video, it shows [[Lorne Lanning]] in his studio working on some graphics design for the game using a digital pen and he says that Soulstorm is "soon to be released".&lt;ref name="soulstormunite"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lanning |first1=Lorne |title=Oddworld Video Showcase Unite Berlin |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv9Zoyo8o8s |website=YouTube |accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then confirmed that Soulstorm will be released in 2019 - but platforms have not been announced.

'''Operations research''', or '''operational research''' in British usage,  is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informs.org/About-INFORMS/About-Operations-Research |title=About Operations Research |publisher=INFORMS.org |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the term 'operational analysis' is used in the British (and some British Commonwealth) military as an intrinsic part of capability development, management and assurance.  In particular, operational analysis forms part of the Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisals (COEIA), which support British defense capability acquisition decision-making.

It is often considered to be a sub-field of [[applied mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathontheweb.org/mathweb/mi-mathbyclass.html |title=Mathematics Subject Classification |publisher=American Mathematical Society |date= 23 May 2011 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The terms [[management science]] and [[decision science]] are sometimes used as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Systems analysis for computer-based information systems|series=West series in data processing and information systems|first=James C.|last=Wetherbe|publisher=West Pub. Co.|year=1979|isbn=9780829902280|quotation=A systems analyst who contributes in the area of DSS must be skilled in such areas as management science (synonymous with decision science and operation research), modeling, simulation, and advanced statistics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employing techniques from other mathematical sciences, such as [[mathematical model]]ing, [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[mathematical optimization]], operations research arrives at optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex decision-making problems. Because of its emphasis on human-technology interaction and because of its focus on practical applications, operations research has overlap with other disciplines, notably [[industrial engineering]] and [[operations management]], and draws on [[psychology]] and [[Organizational studies|organization science]]. Operations research is often concerned with determining the [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] (of profit, performance, or yield) or minimum (of loss, risk, or cost) of some real-world objective. Originating in military efforts before World War II, its techniques have grown to concern problems in a variety of industries.&lt;ref name="hsor.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsor.org/what_is_or.cfm |title=What is OR |publisher=HSOR.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Operational research (OR) encompasses a wide range of problem-solving techniques and methods applied in the pursuit of improved decision-making and efficiency, such as [[simulation]], [[mathematical optimization]], [[queueing theory]] and other [[Stochastic process|stochastic-process]] models, [[Markov Decision Process|Markov decision processes]], [[Econometrics|econometric methods]], [[data envelopment analysis]], [[neural networks]], [[Expert System|expert systems]], [[decision analysis]], and the [[analytic hierarchy process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos044.htm |title=Operations Research Analysts |publisher=Bls.gov |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all of these techniques involve the construction of mathematical models that attempt to describe the system. Because of the computational and statistical nature of most of these fields, OR also has strong ties to [[computer science]] and [[analytics]]. Operational researchers faced with a new problem must determine which of these techniques are most appropriate given the nature of the system, the goals for improvement, and constraints on time and computing power.

The major sub-disciplines in modern operational research, as identified by the journal ''Operations Research'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.informs.org/site/OperationsResearch/index.php?c=10&amp;kat=Forthcoming+Papers |title=OR / Pubs / IOL Home |publisher=INFORMS.org |date=2 January 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527093022/http://www.informs.org/site/OperationsResearch/index.php?c=10&amp;kat=Forthcoming+Papers |archivedate=27 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* Computing and information technologies
* [[Financial engineering]]
* [[Manufacturing]], [[service science]]s, and [[supply chain management]]
* Policy modeling and public sector work
* Revenue management
* [[Simulation]]
* [[Stochastics|Stochastic models]]

==History==
In the decades after the two world wars, the tools of operations research were more widely applied to problems in business, industry and society. Since that time, operational research has expanded into a field widely used in industries ranging from petrochemicals to airlines, finance, logistics, and government, moving to a focus on the development of mathematical models that can be used to analyse and optimize complex systems, and has become an area of active academic and industrial research.&lt;ref name="hsor.org"/&gt;

===Historical origins===
In the 17th century, mathematicians like [[Christiaan Huygens]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] ([[problem of points]]) tried to solve problems involving complex decisions with [[probability]]. Others in the 18th and 19th centuries solved these types of problems with [[combinatorics]]. [[Charles Babbage]]'s research into the cost of transportation and sorting of mail led to England's [[Uniform Penny Post|universal "Penny Post"]] in 1840, and studies into the dynamical behaviour of railway vehicles in defence of the [[Great Western Railway|GWR]]'s broad gauge.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Sodhi, "What about the 'O' in O.R.?" OR/MS Today, December, 2007, p. 12, http://www.lionhrtpub.com/orms/orms-12-07/frqed.html&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 20th century, study of inventory management could be considered the origin of modern operations research with [[Economic order quantity|economic order quantity]] developed by [[Ford W. Harris]] in 1913. Operational research may have originated in the efforts of military planners during World War I (convoy theory and [[Lanchester's laws]]). [[Percy Bridgman]] brought operational research to bear on problems in physics in the 1920s and would later attempt to extend these to the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;P. W. Bridgman, The Logic of Modern Physics, The MacMillan Company, New York, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; 

Modern operational research originated at the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment|Bawdsey Research Station]] in the UK in 1937 and was the result of an initiative of the station's superintendent, [[Albert Percival Rowe|A. P. Rowe]]. Rowe conceived the idea as a means to analyse and improve the working of the UK's [[early warning radar]] system, [[Chain Home]] (CH). Initially, he analysed the operating of the radar equipment and its communication networks, expanding later to include the operating personnel's behaviour. This revealed unappreciated limitations of the CH network and allowed remedial action to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/682073/operations-research/68171/History#ref22348 |title=operations research (industrial engineering) :: History – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists in the United Kingdom including [[Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett|Patrick Blackett]] (later Lord Blackett OM PRS), [[Cecil Gordon (scientist)|Cecil Gordon]], [[Solly Zuckerman, Baron Zuckerman|Solly Zuckerman]], (later Baron Zuckerman OM, KCB, FRS), [[Conrad Hal Waddington|C. H. Waddington]], [[Owen Wansbrough-Jones]], [[Frank Yates]], [[Jacob Bronowski]] and [[Freeman Dyson]], and in the United States with [[George Dantzig]] looked for ways to make better decisions in such areas as [[logistics]] and training schedules

===Second World War===

The modern field of operational research arose during World War II. In the World War II era, operational research was defined as "a scientific method of providing executive departments with a quantitative basis for decisions regarding the operations under their control".&lt;ref name=C67-3-4-48-para-1&gt;"Operational Research in the British Army 1939–1945, October 1947, Report C67/3/4/48, UK National Archives file WO291/1301&lt;br /&gt;Quoted on the dust-jacket of: Morse, Philip M, and Kimball, George E, ''Methods of Operation Research'', 1st edition revised, MIT Press &amp; J Wiley, 5th printing, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for it included operational analysis (UK Ministry of Defence from 1962)&lt;ref name=PROCATWO291&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=109&amp;CATLN=2&amp;Highlight=&amp;FullDetails=True UK National Archives Catalogue for WO291] lists a War Office organisation called [[Army Operational Research Group]] (AORG) that existed from 1946 to 1962. "In January 1962 the name was changed to Army Operational Research Establishment (AORE). Following the creation of a unified Ministry of Defence, a tri-service operational research organisation was established: the [[Defence Operational Research Establishment]] (DOAE) which was formed in 1965, and it the Army Operational Research Establishment based at West Byfleet."&lt;/ref&gt; and quantitative management.&lt;ref&gt;http://brochure.unisa.ac.za/myunisa/data/subjects/Quantitative%20Management.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] close to 1,000 men and women in Britain were engaged in operational research. About 200 operational research scientists worked for the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA117 p. 117] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827004623/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA117 |date=27 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrick Blackett]] worked for several different organizations during the war. Early in the war while working for the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) he set up a team known as the "Circus" which helped to reduce the number of [[anti-aircraft artillery]] rounds needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft from an average of over 20,000 at the start of the [[Battle of Britain]] to 4,000 in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA94 pp. 91–94] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827041022/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA94 |date=27 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B 24 in raf service 23 03 05.jpg|thumb|A [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Liberator]] in standard RAF green/dark earth/black night bomber finish as originally used by Coastal Command]]
In 1941, Blackett moved from the RAE to the Navy, after first working with [[RAF Coastal Command]], in 1941 and then early in 1942 to the [[Admiralty]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA109 p. 96,109] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002032938/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA109 |date=2 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackett's team at Coastal Command's Operational Research Section (CC-ORS) included two future [[Nobel prize]] winners and many other people who went on to be pre-eminent in their fields.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA96 p. 96] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327234509/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA96 |date=27 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They undertook a number of crucial analyses that aided the war effort. Britain introduced the [[convoy]] system to reduce shipping losses, but while the principle of using warships to accompany merchant ships was generally accepted, it was unclear whether it was better for convoys to be small or large. Convoys travel at the speed of the slowest member, so small convoys can travel faster. It was also argued that small convoys would be harder for German [[U-boat]]s to detect. On the other hand, large convoys could deploy more warships against an attacker. Blackett's staff showed that the losses suffered by convoys depended largely on the number of escort vessels present, rather than the size of the convoy. Their conclusion was that a few large convoys are more defensible than many small ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familyheritage.ca/Articles/victory1943.html |title="Numbers are Essential": Victory in the North Atlantic Reconsidered, March–May 1943 |publisher=Familyheritage.ca |date=24 May 1943 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While performing an analysis of the methods used by [[RAF Coastal Command]] to hunt and destroy submarines, one of the analysts asked what colour the aircraft were. As most of them were from Bomber Command they were painted black for night-time operations. At the suggestion of CC-ORS a test was run to see if that was the best colour to camouflage the aircraft for daytime operations in the grey North Atlantic skies. Tests showed that aircraft painted white were on average not spotted until they were 20% closer than those painted black. This change indicated that 30% more submarines would be attacked and sunk for the same number of sightings.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA101 p. 101]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these findings Coastal Command changed their aircraft to using white undersurfaces.

Other work by the CC-ORS indicated that on average if the trigger depth of aerial-delivered [[depth charge]]s (DCs) were changed from 100 feet to 25 feet, the kill ratios would go up. The reason was that if a U-boat saw an aircraft only shortly before it arrived over the target then at 100 feet the charges would do no damage (because the U-boat wouldn't have had time to descend as far as 100 feet), and if it saw the aircraft a long way from the target it had time to alter course under water so the chances of it being within the 20-foot kill zone of the charges was small. It was more efficient to attack those submarines close to the surface when the targets' locations were better known than to attempt their destruction at greater depths when their positions could only be guessed. Before the change of settings from 100 feet to 25 feet, 1% of submerged U-boats were sunk and 14% damaged. After the change, 7% were sunk and 11% damaged. (If submarines were caught on the surface, even if attacked shortly after submerging, the numbers rose to 11% sunk and 15% damaged). Blackett observed "there can be few cases where such a great operational gain had been obtained by such a small and simple change of tactics".&lt;ref&gt;(Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA103 pp. 102,103])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|RAF Bomber Command's Operational Research Section}}
Bomber Command's Operational Research Section (BC-ORS), analyzed a report of a survey carried out by [[RAF Bomber Command]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} For the survey, Bomber Command inspected all bombers returning from bombing raids over Germany over a particular period. All damage inflicted by German [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defences]] was noted and the recommendation was given that armour be added in the most heavily damaged areas. This recommendation was not adopted because the fact that the aircraft returned with these areas damaged indicated these areas were not vital, and adding armour to non-vital areas where damage is acceptable negatively affects aircraft performance. Their suggestion to remove some of the crew so that an aircraft loss would result in fewer personnel losses, was also rejected by RAF command. Blackett's team made the logical recommendation that the armour be placed in the areas which were completely untouched by damage in the bombers which returned. They reasoned that the survey was biased, since it only included aircraft that returned to Britain. The untouched areas of returning aircraft were probably vital areas, which, if hit, would result in the loss of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dirty Little Secrets of the Twentieth Century | publisher=[[Harper Paperbacks]] | author=James F. Dunnigan | year=1999 | pages=215–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story has been disputed,&lt;ref&gt;http://lesswrong.com/lw/bbv/examine_your_assumptions/&lt;/ref&gt; with a similar damage assessment study completed in the US by the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1080/01621459.1980.10477469|title = The Statistical Research Group, 1942–1945|journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume = 75|issue = 370|pages = 320–330|year = 1980|last1 = Wallis|first1 = W.

When Germany organized its air defences into the [[Kammhuber Line]], it was realized by the British that if the RAF bombers were to fly in a [[bomber stream]] they could overwhelm the night fighters who flew in individual cells directed to their targets by ground controllers. It was then a matter of calculating the statistical loss from collisions against the statistical loss from night fighters to calculate how close the bombers should fly to minimize RAF losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/thousands.html |title=RAF History – Bomber Command 60th Anniversary |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "exchange rate" ratio of output to input was a characteristic feature of operational research. By comparing the number of flying hours put in by Allied aircraft to the number of U-boat sightings in a given area, it was possible to redistribute aircraft to more productive patrol areas. Comparison of exchange rates established "effectiveness ratios" useful in planning. The ratio of 60 [[Mine (naval)|mines]] laid per ship sunk was common to several campaigns: German mines in British ports, British mines on German routes, and United States mines in Japanese routes.&lt;ref name="Proceedings"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Milkman, Raymond H. |title=Operation Research in World War II |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] Proceedings |date=May 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operational research doubled the on-target bomb rate of [[B-29]]s bombing Japan from the [[Marianas Islands]] by increasing the training ratio from 4 to 10 percent of flying hours; revealed that wolf-packs of three United States submarines were the most effective number to enable all members of the pack to engage targets discovered on their individual patrol stations; revealed that glossy enamel paint was more effective camouflage for night fighters than traditional dull camouflage paint finish, and the smooth paint finish increased airspeed by reducing skin friction.&lt;ref name="Proceedings"/&gt;

On land, the operational research sections of the Army Operational Research Group (AORG) of the [[Ministry of Supply]] (MoS) were landed in [[Operation Overlord|Normandy in 1944]], and they followed British forces in the advance across Europe. They analyzed, among other topics, the effectiveness of artillery, aerial bombing and anti-tank shooting.

===After World War II===
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
With expanded techniques and growing awareness of the field at the close of the war, operational research was no longer limited to only operational, but was extended to encompass equipment procurement, training, logistics and infrastructure. Operations Research also grew in many areas other than the military once scientists learned to apply its principles to the civilian sector. With the development of the [[simplex algorithm]] for [[linear programming]] in 1947&lt;ref name="pitt.edu"&gt;{{cite book|title=PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH |contribution=1.2 A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~jrclass/or/or-intro.html#history}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of computers over the next three decades, Operations Research can now "solve problems with hundreds of thousands of variables and constraints. Moreover, the large volumes of data required for such problems can be stored and manipulated very efficiently."&lt;ref name="pitt.edu"/&gt;

==Problems addressed==
* [[Critical path analysis]] or [[project planning]]: identifying those processes in a complex project which affect the overall duration of the project
* [[Floorplanning]]: designing the layout of equipment in a factory or components on a [[computer chip]] to reduce [[manufacturing]] time (therefore reducing cost)

* [[Scheduling (computing)|Scheduling]]:
** [[Nurse scheduling problem|Personnel staffing]]
** Manufacturing steps
** [[Project management|Project tasks]]
** Network data traffic: these are known as [[queueing model]]s or queueing systems.
** Sports events and their television coverage
* Blending of raw materials in oil refineries
* Determining optimal prices, in many retail and B2B settings, within the disciplines of [[pricing science]]
* [[Cutting stock problem]]: Cutting small items out of bigger ones.

Operational research is also used extensively in government where [[evidence-based policy]] is used.

==Management science==
{{main|Management science}}
In 1967 [[Stafford Beer]] characterized the field of management science as "the business use of operations research".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stafford Beer]] (1967) ''Management Science: The Business Use of Operations Research''&lt;/ref&gt; However, in modern times the term management science may also be used to refer to the separate fields of [[organizational studies]] or [[corporate strategy]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Like operational research itself, management science (MS) is an interdisciplinary branch of applied mathematics devoted to optimal decision planning, with strong links with economics, business, engineering, and other [[science]]s. It uses various [[science|scientific]] [[research]]-based principles, [[Strategy|strategies]], and [[analytical method]]s including [[mathematical model]]ing, statistics and [[numerical algorithm]]s to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and meaningful management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems. Management scientists help businesses to achieve their goals using the scientific methods of operational research.

The management scientist's mandate is to use rational, systematic, science-based techniques to inform and improve decisions of all kinds. Of course, the techniques of management science are not restricted to business applications but may be applied to military, medical, public administration, charitable groups, political groups or community groups.

Management science is concerned with developing and applying [[scientific modeling|models]] and [[concept]]s that may prove useful in helping to illuminate management issues and solve managerial problems, as well as designing and developing new and better models of organizational excellence.&lt;ref name="LS"&gt;[http://www.lums.lancs.ac.uk/departments/ManSci/DeptProfile/WhatisManSci/ What is Management Science?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914101120/http://www.lums.lancs.ac.uk/departments/ManSci/DeptProfile/WhatisManSci/ |date=14 September 2008 }} Lancaster University, 2008. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of these models within the corporate sector became known as management science.&lt;ref name="UTK"&gt;[http://bus.utk.edu/soms/information/whatis_msci.html What is Management Science?] The University of Tennessee, 2006. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications===
Applications are abundant such as in airlines, manufacturing companies, [[service organization]]s, military branches, and government. The range of problems and issues to which it has contributed insights and solutions is vast. It includes:&lt;ref name="LS"/&gt;
* Scheduling (of airlines, trains, buses etc.)
* Assignment (assigning crew to flights, trains or buses; employees to projects; commitment and dispatch of power generation facilities)
* Facility location (deciding most appropriate location for new facilities such as warehouse; factory or fire station)
* Hydraulics &amp; Piping Engineering (managing flow of water from reservoirs)
* Health Services (information and supply chain management)
* Game Theory (identifying, understanding; developing strategies adopted by companies)
* Urban Design
* Computer Network Engineering (packet routing; timing; analysis)
* Telecom &amp; Data Communication Engineering (packet routing; timing; analysis)
&lt;ref&gt;http://nak-architecture.com/index.php/en/services/blog/55-urban-operations-research-uor&lt;/ref&gt;

Management is also concerned with so-called 'soft-operational analysis' which concerns methods for [[strategic planning]], strategic [[decision support]], [[problem structuring methods]]. 
In dealing with these sorts of challenges, mathematical [[modeling and simulation]] may not be appropriate or may not suffice. Therefore, during the past 30 years{{vague|date=November 2017}}, a number of non-quantified modeling methods have been developed. These include:{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* stakeholder based approaches including [[metagame analysis]] and [[drama theory]]
* [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]] and various forms of [[influence diagram]]s
* cognitive mapping
* strategic choice 
* robustness analysis

[[File:Academic disciplines (collage).jpg|thumb|Collage of images representing different academic disciplines]]

An '''academic discipline''' or '''field of study''' is a branch of [[knowledge]], [[education|taught]] and [[research]]ed as part of [[higher education]]. A scholar's discipline is commonly defined by the [[faculty (division)|university faculties]] and [[learned society|learned societies]] to which he or she belongs and the [[academic journal]]s in which he or she publishes [[research]].

Disciplines vary between well-established ones that exist in almost all universities and have well-defined rosters of [[Academic journal|journal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and conferences and nascent ones supported by only a few universities and publications. A discipline may have branches, and these are often called sub-disciplines.

There is no [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] on how some academic disciplines should be classified, for example whether [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] are disciplines of the [[social science]]s or of the [[humanities]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to academic disciplines.

:''The following [[Portal:Contents/Outlines|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to law:
'''Law''' (''[[law|article link]]'') is the set of rules and principles (laws) by which a society is governed, through enforcement by governmental authorities.  Law is also the field which concerns the creation and administration of laws, and includes any and all [[Legal systems of the world|legal systems]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Nature of law ==
Law can be described as all of the following:

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; body of knowledge given to - or received by - a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] &amp;ndash; academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.
* [[System]] &amp;ndash; set of elements (often called 'components' instead) and relationships which are different from relationships of the set or its elements to other elements or sets.
** part of the [[legal system]] &amp;ndash; legal scholarship and practice shapes how law is interpreted and applied in societies

==Legal systems==
* [[List of national legal systems]]
* [[Common law]]
* [[Civil law (legal system)]]
* [[Religious law]]
** [[Bahá'í laws]]
** [[Biblical law]], in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]
** [[Canon law]], in Christianity
*** [[Canons of the Apostles]]
*** [[Canon law of the Anglican Communion]]
*** [[Canon law of the Catholic Church]]
****[[Canon (canon law)]] - a certain rule or norm of conduct or belief prescribed by the Catholic Church. The word "canon" comes from the Greek kanon, which in its original usage denoted a straight rod that was later the instrument used by architects and artificers as a measuring stick for making straight lines. 
****[[Custom (canon law)]] - the repeated and constant performance of certain acts for a defined period of time, which, with the approval of the competent legislator, thereby acquire the force of law. A custom is an unwritten law introduced by the continuous acts of the faithful with the consent of the legitimate legislator. 
****[[Decree (canon law)]] - an order or law made by a superior authority for the direction of others. 
****[[Dispensation (canon law)]] - the exemption from the immediate obligation of law in certain cases. Its object is to modify the hardship often arising from the rigorous application of general laws to particular cases, and its essence is to preserve the law by suspending its operation in such cases. 
****[[Interpretation (canon law)]] - canonists provide and obey rules for the interpretation and acceptation of words, in order that legislation is correctly understood and the extent of its obligation is determined. 
****[[Obrogation]] -  the enacting of a contrary law that is a revocation of a previous law. It may also be the partial cancellation or amendment of a law, decree, or legal regulation by the imposition of a newer one. 
****[[Promulgation (canon law)]] - the publication of a law by which it is made known publicly, and is required by canon law for the law to obtain legal effect.
** [[Halakha]], in Judaism
** [[Hindu law]]
** [[Jain law]]
** [[Patimokkha]], in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]

'''Paul James Lioy''' (May 27, 1947 – July 8, 2015) was a [[United States]] [[environmental health]] scientist born in [[Passaic, New Jersey]], working in the field of [[exposure science]]. He was one of the world’s leading experts in personal exposure to toxins. He published in the areas of air pollution, airborne and deposited particles, Homeland Security, and Hazardous Wastes. Lioy was a Professor and Division Director at the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Rutgers University - School of Public Health. Until 30 June 2015 he was a Professor and Vice Chair of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, [[Rutgers University]] - [[Robert Wood Johnson Medical School]]. He was Deputy Director of Government Relations and Director of Exposure Science, at the Rutgers Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute in [[Piscataway, New Jersey]]. 

Lioy has been recognized for his research and contributions to development of environmental policy by the International Society of Exposure Analysis (now International Society of Exposure Science) and by the Air &amp; Waste Management Association, both with Lifetime Achievement Awards. Since 2002 he had been one of [[Information Sciences Institute]]’s Most Highly Cited Scientists in the Category of Environment and Ecology, and is one of the founders of the International Society of Exposure (Analysis) Science (1989).

==Early life and education==
Paul J. Lioy graduated from [[Passaic High School]] in 1965, and [[Montclair State College]] (today University), NJ in 1969 (Magnum Cum Laude) In 1971, he received a master's degree from [[Auburn University]], AL, in [[Auburn University Physics Department|Physics]], and in 1975 an M.S. and Ph.D. in environmental science from [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;[[Margalit Fox|Fox, Margalit]].

==Leagacy in exposure science==
Lioy’s reputation evolved primarily based upon his role in developing scientific principles and refining the approaches that define the field of exposure science. This discipline is associated with the field of environmental and occupational health sciences, which includes epidemiology and risk assessment, and prevention. In a 1990 article published in Environmental Science and Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | year = 1990 | title = The analysis of total human exposure for exposure assessment: a multi-discipline science for examining human contact with contaminants | url = | journal = Environmental Science and Technology | volume = 24 | issue = 7| pages = 938–945 | doi=10.1021/es00077a001}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was the first to properly locate exposure science as the bridge between traditional environmental sciences and the understanding of human health outcomes.  Building upon the work of occupational hygiene and the work of Wayne Ott,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ott | first1 = WR | year = 1995 | title = Human exposure assessment: the birth of a new science | url = | journal = Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 449–472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lioy has clearly shown that the most important aspect of total human exposure is whether or not an individual comes into contact with a toxin, discussed in a 2010 review article on exposure science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | year = 2010 | title = Exposure Science: A View of the Past and Major Milestones for the Future | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 118 | issue = 8| pages = 1081–1090 | doi=10.1289/ehp.0901634 | pmid=20308034 | pmc=2920079}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his recent{{when|date=July 2017}} book on exposure science.&lt;ref&gt;Lioy PJ, Weisel C. 2014. Exposure Science: Basic Principles and Applications. Oxford, UK: Academic Press, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter he has clearly linked external and internal markers of exposure.  Thus, prevention is a key part of the application of this field of science. He re-analyzed the work of the "father of occupational medicine", [[Bernardino Ramazzini]] who provided the initial reasons for examining contact with an agent to define ways to control occupational illness. This historical analysis can be used to improve the way exposure science evolves in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | year = 2007 | title = Bernardino Ramazzini: thoughts on his Treatise and linking exposure science and environmental/occupational medicine for prevention or intervention within environmental health | url = | journal = European Journal of Oncology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 69–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lioy is also a Fellow of the Collegium Ramazzini.

Lioy has been a central figure in understanding exposure to the air pollutant [[tropospheric ozone]], [[chloroform]] and other toxicant exposures from shower water, [[hexavalent chromium]] wastes, and most recently, the exposures derived from the dust and smoke released in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="Lioy PJ 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Pellizzari | first2 = E | last3 = Prezant | first3 = D | year = 2006 | title = The World Trade Center Aftermath and Its Effects on Health: Understanding and Learning Through Human-Exposure Science | url = | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 40 | issue = 22| pages = 6876–6885 | doi=10.1021/es062980e}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been a major figure in defining some of the basic data requirements (and providing exposure indices) for examining human exposures within the [[National Children's Study]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Isukapalli | first2 = S | last3 = Trasande | first3 = L | last4 = Thorpe | first4 = L | last5 = Dellarco | first5 = M | last6 = Weisel | first6 = C | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 2009 | title = Using national and local extant data to characterize environmental exposures in the National Children's Study (NCS): Queens County, New York | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 117 | issue = 10| pages = 1494–1504 | doi=10.1289/ehp.0900623 | pmid=20019897 | pmc=2790501}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Co-Principal Investigator within the portion of the National Human Exposure Assessment Survey (NHEXAS) conducted in five mid-western states, led by Edo Pellizzari of [[Research Triangle Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pellizzari | first1 = E | last2 = Lioy | first2 = PJ | last3 = Quackenboss | first3 = J | last4 = Whitmore | first4 = R | last5 = Clayton | first5 = A | last6 = Freeman | first6 = N | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 1995 | title = The design and implementation of phase I national human exposure assessment study in EPA Region V | url = | journal = Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 327–358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently his research addresses human exposure to engineered nanotechnology consumer products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = P.J. | last2 = Nazarenko | first2 = Y. | last3 = Han | first3 = T.W. | last4 = Lioy | first4 = M.J. | last5 = Mainelis | first5 = G. | year = 2010 | title = Nanotechnology and Exposure Science What Is Needed To Fill the Research and Data Gaps for Consumer Products | url = | journal = International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 378–387 | doi=10.1179/oeh.2010.16.4.378| pmid = 21222382 | pmc = 4011082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nazarenko | first1 = Y. | last2 = Han | first2 = T.W. | last3 = Lioy | first3 = P.J. | last4 = Mainelis | first4 = G. | year = 2011 | title = Potential for exposure to engineered nanoparticles from nanotechnology-based consumer spray products | url = | journal = Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 515–528 | doi=10.1038/jes.2011.10 | pmid=21364702 | pmc=4027967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nazarenko | first1 = Y. | last2 = Lioy | first2 = P.J. | last3 = Mainelis | first3 = G. | year = 2014 | title = Quantitative assessment of inhalation exposure and deposited dose of aerosol from nanotechnology-based consumer sprays | journal = Environmental Science: Nano | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 161–171 | doi = 10.1039/c3en00053b | pmid=25621175 | pmc=4303255}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the exposure of athletes to artificial turf used on athletic fields. In addition,  from 1987 to 1991 he was the Chairman of the First [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC) Committee that directly addressed human exposure issues and published Human Exposure to Air Pollutants: Advances and Opportunities," also called "White Book.&lt;ref&gt;NRC. 1991. Human exposure assessment for airborne pollutants:  advances and opportunities. Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;" He was Vice Chair of the NRC committee on Exposure Science that produced the report entitled "Exposure Science in the 21st Century:  A Vision and A Strategy".&lt;ref&gt;NRC. 2012. Exposure Science in the 21st Century:  A Vision and A Strategy. National Research Council. Washington, DC. http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13507&lt;/ref&gt; He was also vice chair of the WTC Technical Panel that was formed to address the issues of residential cleanup during the WTC Aftermath.

===Ozone===
During the early 1980s Lioy recognized that the public health metric for defining exposure of the general population to troposphere [[ozone]] (smog) was incorrect and that the one-hour standard for peak ozone levels should be replaced by an eight-hour standard. Independently, Peter Rombout, [[RIVM]], Netherlands, discovered the same issue. In 1986, they collaborated and published an article on the need for an eight-hour ozone standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rombout | first1 = P | last2 = Lioy | first2 = PJ | last3 = Goldstein | first3 = BD | year = 1986 | title = Rationale for an eight hour ozone standard | url = | journal = Journal of the Air Pollution Control Association | volume = 36 | issue = 8| pages = 913–916 | doi=10.1080/00022470.1986.10466130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lioy's group also conducted research on the relationship between ozone exposure and visits to emergency rooms during the summertime. In 2002, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) published an eight-hour [[NAAQS]] ozone standard based upon the scientific exposure–response evidence from multiple laboratories that exposures to asthmatics and others to eight hours of ozone above 0.80 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register, 68 FR 32802, June 3, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  This standard for protection of public health was tightened to 0.75 ppm but remains as an 8-hour contact with the air pollutant, and is in final review for a further tightening of the 8-hour standard.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register, 73 FR 16436, March 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s Lioy’s laboratory became increasingly focused on dust in the home as a potential metric of exposure to metals and organic compounds. Included was the concurrent scientific issue of the semi-volatility of the materials associated with dust particles. This led to studies that demonstrated that semi-volatile pesticides should not just be considered just residues after application, but as toxin that can be spread throughout the home based process of evaporation and absorption and adsorption. This process was described in an article Published in 1998, and focused on the accumulation of pesticides in children’s toys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gurunathan | first1 = S | last2 = Robson | first2 = M | last3 = Freeman | first3 = N | last4 = Buckley | first4 = B | last5 = Roy | first5 = A | last6 = Meyer | first6 = R | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 1998 | title = Accumulation of chlorpyrifos on residential surfaces and toys accessible to children | url = | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 106 | issue = 1| pages = 9–16 | doi=10.1289/ehp.981069| pmid = 9417768 | pmc = 1532945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ways to protect toys were summarized in popular magazines and web sites. The work was used in revisions of the EPA standards for use of the pesticide [[chlorpyrifos]] indoors. The complex issues of dust and semi-volatile toxins in homes were published in 2002 and 2006 review articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Freeman | first2 = NC | last3 = Millette | first3 = JR | year = 2002 | title = Dust: a metric for use in residential and building exposure assessment and source characterization | url = | journal = Environ Health Perspect | volume = 110 | issue = 10| pages = 969–983 | doi=10.1289/ehp.02110969| pmid = 12361921 | pmc = 1241022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;15.

===Chromium wastes===
During the late 1980s the state of NJ discovered that wastes from the refining and production of the chrome plated products had been used as apparent Clean fill in various residential settings, and was also had contaminated a number other industrial locations.Lioy conducted a comprehensive study of chromium wastes in Jersey City, including residential exposures and the bioavailability and size distribution if the wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Freeman | first2 = NCG | last3 = Wainman | first3 = T | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 1992 | title = Microenvironmental analysis of residential exposure to chromium-laden wastes in and around New-Jersey homes | url = | journal = Risk Analysis | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 287–299 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1992.tb00676.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitsa | first1 = V | last2 = Lioy | first2 = PJ | last3 = Chow | first3 = JC | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 1992 | title = Particle-Size Distribution of Chromium: Total and Hexavalent Chromium in Inspirable, Thoracic, and Respirable Soil Particles from Contaminated Sites in New Jersey | url = | journal = Aerosol Science and Technology | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 213–229 | doi=10.1080/02786829208959572}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work found that similar to current lead problems, the chromium exposures indoors were highly related to the levels found in house dust and not ambient air. In addition the use of dust laden corium as a marker of exposure was extremely valuable in conclusively defining that the removal of the wastes in the residential neighborhoods brought the levels of chromium down to background by the end of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freeman | first1 = NC | last2 = Lioy | first2 = PJ | last3 = Stern | first3 = AH | year = 2000 | title = Reduction in residential chromium following site remediation | url = | journal = Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association | volume = 50 | issue = 6| pages = 948–953 | doi=10.1080/10473289.2000.10464132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts are continuing in Jersey City and are now using analytical methods perfected at EOHSI to measure the levels of the hexavalent chromium (carcinogenic form) in human blood and in the areas around remaining industrial sites, that are beginning to receive final remediation. Acomprehensive review paper on this work was published by Stern, Gochfeld and Lioy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stern | first1 = A.H. | last2 = Gochfeld | first2 = M. | last3 = Lioy | first3 = P.J. | year = 2013 | title = Two decades of exposure assessment studies on chromate production waste in Jersey City, New Jersey--what we have learned about exposure characterization and its value to public health and remediation | url = | journal = J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 2–12 | doi=10.1038/jes.2012.100| pmid = 23131713 | pmc = 4286875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Trade Center dust===
In the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] (WTC), Lioy was able to see the dust plumes from his home in [[Cranford, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; The major environmental and occupational health related issue during the aftermath of the building collapses was the size range and composition of the dust and smoke that was released during the first hours to days post collapse of the twin towers, and subsequently the dust that had deposited indoors and required cleanup. In collaboration with multiple laboratories, Lioy examined the composition and size distribution of the WTC dust in detail for [[inorganic]], [[Organic compound|organic]] and [[Ionic compound|ionic]] species. The results were published in a 2002 article entitled ''Characterization of the dust/smoke aerosol that settled east of the WTC in lower Manhattan after the collapse of the WTC September 11, 2001'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Weisel | first2 = CP | last3 = Millette | first3 = JR | last4 = Eisenreich | first4 = S | last5 = Vallero | first5 = D | last6 = Offenberg | first6 = J | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 2002 | title = Characterization of the dust/smoke aerosol that settled east of the WTC in lower Manhattan after the collapse of the WTC 11 September 2001 | url = | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 110 | issue = 7| pages = 703–714 | doi=10.1289/ehp.02110703| pmid = 12117648 | pmc = 1240917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been used to understand the cause of the WTC cough and other health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prezant | first1 = DJ | last2 = Weiden | first2 = M | last3 = Banauch | first3 = GI | last4 = McGuinness | first4 = G | last5 = Rom | first5 = WN | last6 = Aldrich | first6 = TK | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 2002 | title = Cough and bronchial responsiveness in firefighters at the WTC site | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 347 | issue = 11| pages = 806–815 | doi=10.1056/nejmoa021300 | pmid=12226151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other work that Lioy and colleagues published through 2009, they described the time line of exposure to the local population and workers from the moments after the collapse through December 2001, and pointed out the many lessons that can be learned from the WTC in order to effectively respond to other disasters.&lt;ref name="Lioy PJ 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Georgopoulos | first2 = P | year = 2006 | title = The anatomy of the exposures that occurred around the World Trade Center site: 9/11 and beyond | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1076 | issue = | pages = 54–79 | doi=10.1196/annals.1371.002 | pmid=17119193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of his death, he was working with Dr. [[Philip J. Landrigan]] et al. of [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] on the long-term health effects experienced by WTC workers. During the aftermath Lioy was interviewed many times by the Media on WTC Dust related issues from October 2001 through 2011&lt;ref&gt;(See, e.g. [http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2011/sep/08/dust/ Decade 9/11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005160802/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2011/sep/08/dust/ |date=2012-10-05 }} and [http://beta.wnyc.org/people/paul-lioy/ Please Explain: Dust] - interviews with [[Leonard Lopate]] on [[National Public Radio]]; [http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/07/dr-sanjay-gupta-reports-terror-in-the-dust-debuts-wednesday-sept-7/ Terror in the Dust] - a documentary with [[Dr. Sanjay Gupta]] on [[CNN]]; and [http://blog.national911memorial.org/?p=4475 The Memo Blog: Exploring 9/11 - The World Before and After - Exploring Health Effects of WTC Dust])&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Lioy and his colleagues is mentioned in a book by Anthony Depalma entitled ''City of Dust: Illness, Arrogance, and 9/11''.&lt;ref&gt;DePalma A. (2010). City of Dust: Illness, Arrogance, and 9/11.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6575">'''Peer-mediated instruction''' ('''PMI''') is an approach in [[special education]] where [[peer group|peers]] of the target students are trained to provide necessary tutoring in educational, behavioral, and/or social concerns.(Chan et al., 2009). In PMI, peers may mediate by [[Modelling (psychology)|modeling]] appropriate behavior themselves, using [[Response Prompting Procedures|prompting procedures]] to elicit appropriate behavior from the target students, and [[Reinforcement|reinforcing]] appropriate behavior when it occurs. The peer tutors are chosen from the target students' classrooms, trained to mediate and closely observed during mediation. Among the advantages noted to the technique, it takes advantage of the positive potential of [[Peer pressure#Benign peer pressure|peer pressure]] and may integrate target students more fully in their peer group. Conversely, it is time consuming to implement and presents challenges in making sure that the peers follow proper techniques. However, studies have suggested it may be an effective technique for a wide range of students, including those with [[autism spectrum]] disorders.

==Procedure==
A student or students will be chosen from the target student's classroom to serve as a peer tutor. Garrison-Harrell et al. (as cited in Chan et al., 2009) suggested a systematic way to choosing the peers to be involved in the treatment based on social status and teacher judgment. Students were asked to list three peers they would like to play with on the playground, three peers they would invite to a party, and three peers they consider to be good friends. Teachers reviewed the top candidates, and selected the tutors based on social skills, language skills, school attendance and classroom behavior.

The student or students chosen as peers must be properly coached before the peer relationship begins, both to understand the importance of the intervention and the methods which should be used. Instructors may model behaviors to the peer tutors and may role play with the peer tutors, allowing the peer tutors to experience both parts in the PMI relationship. Other methods for training could include visual aids, reinforcement for correct implementation, instruction manuals and video instructions. Once the PMI relationship begins, the teacher provides on-going feedback, watching the peer at all times while the intervention is being used. (Chan et al., 2009).

==Strengths and limitations==
There are advantages of using PMI as an intervention strategy. First, there is never a shortage of peers to use, especially when implementing an intervention in a school or classroom. Second, students are influenced through [[observational learning]] by what they see their peers doing. Third, students are often less intimidated by a peer than they are a teacher, which makes instruction and feedback from peers potentially more effective. Fourth, it may not only offer short-term intervention benefits, but can also strengthen the target student's social ties within the classroom. Finally, research has been done with many different types of learners, including students with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]], behavior disorders and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], which show that PMI may be effective for a wide range of students (Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2005; Flood, Wilder, Flood &amp; Masuda, 2002).  

In 2009, ''Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders'' published a paper by Chan ''et al.'' that concluded that PMI is a potentially effective intervention approach for students with Autism disorders.

==Application to General Education classroom settings==
Varying forms of peer-mediated instruction and interventions have been conducted in a great range of settings over the decades. Research has been conducted in educational and non-educational environments with positive outcomes in each. It is important to note that PMII strategies are not restricted or inclusive to education or special education, but have been found to be effective in each-as well as inclusive classroom settings. The following characteristics have been identified by Kulik &amp; Kulik (1992), as central for successful implementation of peer-mediated instruction.
      
*''Expectations for student learning''. Teachers should establish high expectation levels. No students are expected to fall below the level of learning needed to be successful at the next level of education.
*''Careful orientation to lessons''. Teachers must clearly describe the relationship of a current lesson to previous study. Students are reminded of key concepts or skills previously covered.
*''Clear and focused instructions to participants''.
*''Close teacher monitoring of student progress''. Frequently formal and informal monitoring of student learning by teachers. Teachers must require that students are accountable for their product and learning.
*''Re-teach''. If students show signs of confusion, misinterpretation or misunderstanding, the teacher must be responsible to teach again.
*''Use classtime for learning''. Students must pace themselves and should be monitored for task completion.
*''Positive and personal teacher and student interaction''. Cooperative Learning and Peer Tutoring Strategies are instruction methods of choice in many classrooms as they are noted for preventing and alleviating many social problems related to children, adolescents, and young adults.

{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}

In [[astronomy]], a '''planisphere''' is a [[star chart]] [[Analog computer|analog computing instrument]] in the form of two adjustable disks that rotate on a common pivot. It can be adjusted to display the visible stars for any time and date. It is an instrument to assist in learning how to recognize [[star]]s and [[constellation]]s. The [[astrolabe]], an instrument that has its origins in  [[Hellenistic astronomy]], is a predecessor of the modern planisphere.
The term ''planisphere'' contrasts with ''[[armillary sphere]]'', where the [[celestial sphere]] is represented by a three-dimensional framework of rings.

==Description==
A planisphere consists of a circular [[star chart]] attached at its center to an opaque circular overlay that has a clear elliptical window or hole so that only a portion of the sky map will be visible in the window or hole area at any given time. The chart and overlay are mounted so that they are free to rotate about a common pivot point at their centers. The star chart contains the [[brightest stars]], constellations and (possibly) [[deep-sky object]]s visible from a particular latitude on Earth. The night sky that one sees from the Earth depends on whether the observer is in the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern]] or [[southern hemisphere]]s and the latitude. A planisphere window is designed for a particular latitude and will be accurate enough for a certain band either side of that. Planisphere makers will usually offer them in a number of versions for different latitudes. Planispheres only show the stars visible from the observer's [[latitude]]; stars below the horizon are not included.

A complete twenty-four-hour time cycle is marked on the rim of the overlay. A full twelve months of [[calendar]] dates are marked on the rim of the starchart. The window is marked to show the direction of the eastern and western horizons. The disk and overlay are adjusted so that the observer's local time of day on the overlay corresponds to that day's date on the star chart disc. The portion of the star chart visible in the window then represents (with a distortion because it is a flat surface representing a spherical volume) the distribution of stars in the sky at that moment for the planisphere's designed location. Users hold the planisphere above their head with the eastern and western horizons correctly aligned to match the chart to actual star positions.

==History==
[[File:F10.v. Drawing of planisphere NLW MS 735C.png|thumb|Medieval planisphere,c.1000. [[National Library of Wales]] MS 735C, [[Aberystwyth]].]]
The word planisphere (Latin ''planisphaerium'') was originally used in the second century by [[Ptolemy]] to describe the representation of a spherical Earth by a map drawn in the plane.
This usage continued into the Renaissance: for example [[Gerardus Mercator]] described his [[Mercator 1569 world map|1569 world map]] as a planisphere.

In this article the word describes the representation of the star-filled celestial sphere on the plane.
The first star chart to have the name "planisphere" was made in 1624 by [[Jacob Bartsch]].
Bartsch was the son-in-law of [[Johannes Kepler]], discoverer of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].

==The star chart==
[[File:Philips Planisphere.jpg|thumb|right|Philips' Planisphere, ca. 1900]]
Since the planisphere shows the celestial sphere in a printed flat, there is always considerable distortion. Planispheres, like all charts, are made using a certain projection method. For planispheres there are two major methods in use, leaving the choice with the designer. One such method is the [[Azimuthal equidistant projection|polar azimuthal equidistant projection]]. Using this projection the sky is charted centered on one of the celestial poles (polar), while circles of equal declination (for instance 60°, 30°, 0° (the celestial equator), -30°, and -60°) lie equidistant from each other and from the poles (equidistant). The shapes of the constellations are proportionally correct in a straight line from the centre outwards, but at right angles to this direction (parallel to the declination circles) there is considerable distortion. That distortion will be worse as the distance to the pole gets greater. If we study the famous constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] in this projection and compare this to the real Orion, we can clearly see this distortion. One notable planisphere using azimuthal equidistant projection addresses this issue by printing a northern view on one side and the southern view on the other, thus reducing the distance charted from the center outward.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidchandler.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[stereographic projection]] solves this problem while introducing another. Using this projection the distances between the declination circles are enlarged in such a way that the shapes of the constellations remain correct. Naturally in this projection the constellations on the edge become too large in comparison to constellations near the celestial pole: Orion will be twice as high as it should be. (This is the same effect that makes Greenland so huge in Mercator charts.) Another disadvantage is that, with more space for constellations near the edge of the planisphere, the space for the constellations around the celestial pole in question will be less than they deserve. For observers at moderate latitudes, who can see the sky near the celestial pole of their hemisphere better than that nearer the horizon, this may be a good reason to prefer a planisphere made with the polar azimuthal equidistant projection method.

==The upper disc==
The upper disc contains a "horizon", that defines the visible part of the sky at any given moment, which is naturally half of the total starry sky. That horizon line is most of the time also distorted, for the same reason the constellations are distorted.
The horizon line on a stereographic projection is a perfect circle.
The horizon line on other projections is a kind of "collapsed" oval.
The horizon is designed for a particular latitude and thus determines the area for which a planisphere is meant. Some more expensive planispheres have several upper discs that can be exchanged, or have an upper disc with more horizon-lines, for different latitudes.

When a planisphere is used in a latitude zone other than the zone for which it was designed, the user will either see stars that are not in the planisphere, or the planisphere will show stars that are not visible in that latitude zone's sky. To study the starry sky thoroughly it may be necessary to buy a planisphere particularly for the area in question.

However, most of the time the part of the sky near the horizon will not show many stars, due to hills, woods, buildings or just because of the thickness of the atmosphere we look through. The lower 5° above the horizon in particular hardly shows any stars (let alone objects) except under the very best conditions. Therefore, a planisphere can fairly accurately be used from +5° to -5° of the design latitude. For example, a planisphere for 40° north can be used between 35° and 45° north.

==Coordinates==
Accurate planispheres  represent the [[celestial coordinates]]: [[right ascension]] and [[declination]]. The changing positions of planets, asteroids or comets in terms of these coordinates can be looked up in annual astronomical guides, and these enable planisphere users to find them in the sky.

Some planispheres use a separate pointer for the declination, using the same pivot point as the upper disc. Some planispheres have a declination feature printed on the upper disc, along the line connecting north and south on the horizon. Right ascension is represented on the edge, where the dates with which to set the planisphere are also found.

'''Project Galileo''' is an educational astronomy project, based at [[Clifton College]] in [[Bristol]], in the [[United Kingdom]]. 

[[File:Robodome.jpg|thumb|Robodome]]

==History==
Project Galileo started in December 2000, as a result of a [[telescope]] being donated to a [[Bristol]] school, with the overall aim of making the system available for other schools in the area to use. The system became operational in July 2005, and is expected to have full on-line capability by the autumn of 2008.

==Aims==
Project Galileo aims to provide a curriculum resource for Science and Technology at Key Stages 3 &amp; 4 and AS/A2 levels, including [[ICT (education)|ICT]] &amp; Design &amp; Technology courses at post-16 level,  to inspire teenagers to "learn the art as well as science of research and research teams, how scientific research is practiced, how physical ideas become mainstream, how collaboration between scientific disciplines fosters greater understanding, and to encourage links and collaboration between schools of different age-ranges and traditions in the city of Bristol." (Project FAQ)

The project focuses on the issues surrounding the maintenance and successful operation of a remote-controlled [[observatory]].  It is built around a remote-controlled telescope with a 1.3 metre dome and [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera located in Bristol, which enables imaging and searches of [[comets]], [[asteroids]], [[supernovae]], deep-sky and planetary objects.

==How it works==
Schools will be able to register via the main Project Galileo website (see [[#External links]] below), and then login to the telescope to order images, much in the same way as is done with other [[#Other online observatories|online school observatories]]. One important feature of the software being developed for the project is that it comes under the [[GPL]], so other schools or institutions who want to develop similar systems will be able to modify the code rather than having to spend vital educational budgets for proprietary software.  The code being used for the project can be found via the [[#External links]].

Other institutions using similar code are the [https://web.archive.org/web/20091001170011/http://www.dur.ac.uk/physics.astrolab/draco/roboscope.html DRACO project at Durham University] and [https://archive.is/20070520191007/http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~dj4/ROY.htm R.O.Y.] (the Robotic Observatory at York), based at [[University of York|York University]].  Project Galileo uses code developed by [http://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?id=542  Dr John Lucey] at [[Durham University]], and ROY is in the process of migrating from Windows-based software to code used by Project Galileo.  All the code being developed is the work of volunteer efforts - if you wish to contribute, please [[#External links| visit the external links]] section below for more details.

Here is a simplified diagram of how the system works:
[[File:How-it-works.jpg|400px|none]]

''In reality, the backend database and control software consist of several systems, including an [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929042024/http://www.opensourcecommunity.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=2 image processing cluster] which is responsible for creating the final processed versions of the raw images that are taken by the telescope.''

'''Reading for special needs''' has become an area of interest as the understanding of [[Reading (process)|reading]] has improved. Teaching children with special needs how to read was not historically pursued due to perspectives of a [[Reading readiness in the USA|Reading Readiness]] model.&lt;ref name="van Kleeck, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Kleeck A, Schuele CM |title=Historical perspectives on literacy in early childhood |journal=Am J Speech Lang Pathol |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=341–55 |date=November 2010 |pmid=20581109 |doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2010/09-0038) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model assumes that a reader must learn to read in a hierarchical manner such that one skill must be mastered before learning the next skill (e.g., a child might be expected to learn the names of the letters in the alphabet in the correct order before being taught how to read his or her name).&lt;ref name="Copeland, Keefe, 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Elizabeth B. Keefe |author2=Susan R. Glaser |author3=Susan Copeland |author4=Elizabeth B. Keefe |title=Effective literacy instruction for students with moderate or severe disabilities |publisher=Paul H. Brookes Publishing |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-55766-837-X |oclc=77011619 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach often led to teaching sub-skills of reading in a decontextualized manner. This style of teaching made it difficult for children to master these early skills, and as a result, did not advance to more advanced literacy instruction and often continued to receive age-inappropriate instruction (e.g., singing the alphabet song).

During the mid-to-late 1970s, the education system shifted to targeting functional skills that were age appropriate for people with special needs.&lt;ref name="Browder, Flowers,2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Browder |first1=D.|last2=Flowers|first2=C.|last3=Ahlgrim-Delzell|first3=L.|last4=Karvonen|first4=M. |last5=Spooner |first5=F.|last6=Algozzine|first6=R.|title=The Alignment of Alternate Assessment Content with Academic and Functional Curricula|journal=The Journal of Special Education|volume=37 |issue=4 |year=2004|pages=211–223|issn=0022-4669|doi=10.1177/00224669040370040101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BrownBranston1979"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown|first1=L.|last2=Branston|first2=M.

This approach was an improvement to previous practices, but it limited the range of literacy skills that people with special needs developed.&lt;ref name="Copeland, Keefe, 2007"/&gt;

A newer model for reading development, specifically with regard to early reading development, is [[Emergent literacies|emergent literacy]], sometimes referred to as early literacy, model. This model purports that children begin reading from birth, and that learning to read is an interactive process based on children’s exposure to literate activities. It is under this new model that children with developmental disabilities and special needs have been considered to be able to learn to read.&lt;ref name="Erickson"&gt;{{cite book|author= K.A. Erickson|title=All children are ready to learn: An emergent versus readiness perspective in early literacy assessment|year=2000|publisher=Seminars in Speech and Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koppenhaver, Erickson, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.A.

==Literacy==
[[Literacy]] refers to both reading and writing skills, w[[Writing|riting]] being the symbolic representation of language, and r[[Reading (process)|eading]] the cognitive process of decoding and understanding the written symbol system. These are very broad and basic definitions as the definitions of these terms often vary based on the model or approach.

==Approaches and models of reading==
There are multiple models and approaches of reading. A few are discussed below.

===The Simple View of Reading===
The Simple View of Reading was originally described by Gough and Tunmer in 1986&lt;ref name="Gough, Tunmer, 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gough|first1=P. B.|last2=Tunmer|first2=W. E.|title=Decoding, Reading, and Reading Disability|journal=Remedial and Special Education|volume=7 |issue=1|year=1986 |pages=6–10|issn=0741-9325|doi=10.1177/074193258600700104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modified by Hoover and Gough in 1990.&lt;ref name="Hoover, Gough, 1990"&gt;{{cite book |author1=W.A. Hoover |author2=P.B. Gough |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Simple View of Reading |year=1990 |publisher=Reading and Writing: An Interdisciplinary Journal |url=http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/Psy338K/Gough/Chapter7/simple_view.pdf |access-date=2012-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113213423/http://www.homepage.psy.utexas.edu/HomePage/Class/Psy338K/Gough/Chapter7/simple_view.pdf |archive-date=2014-11-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Simple View suggests that the ultimate goal of reading comprehension, and in order to have good reading comprehension, you need to have good decoding ability (e.g., ability to interpret the symbols) and good listening comprehension (e.g., your ability to understand oral language).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kendeou P, Savage R, van den Broek P |title=Revisiting the simple view of reading |journal=Br J Educ Psychol |volume=79 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=353–70 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19091164 |doi=10.1348/978185408X369020 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model predicts four categories of readers.&lt;ref name="Catts, Hogan, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Catts HW, Hogan TP, Fey ME |title=Subgrouping poor readers on the basis of individual differences in reading-related abilities |journal=J Learn Disabil |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=151–64 |year=2003 |pmid=15493430 |pmc=2848965 |doi=10.1177/002221940303600208 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Catts, Adlof, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Catts HW, Adlof SM, Weismer SE |title=Language deficits in poor comprehenders: a case for the simple view of reading |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=278–93 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16671844 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2006/023) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers with poor decoding skills but relatively preserved listening comprehension skills would be considered readers who are poor decoders, or dyslexic. Readers with poor listening comprehension skills are referred to as readers who are poor comprehenders. Readers with poor decoding skills and poor listening comprehension skills are considered poor readers, or sometimes referred to as garden-variety poor readers. Readers who have good decoding and listening comprehension skills are considered typical readers.

===The Connectionist Model of Reading Development===
Connectionist models have emphasized an interconnected and interactive system of mappings between printed words (orthography), spoken sounds/words (phonology), and word meanings (semantics).&lt;ref name="Seidenberg, McClelland, 1989"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seidenberg MS, McClelland JL |title=A distributed, developmental model of word recognition and naming |journal=Psychol Rev |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=523–68 |date=October 1989 |pmid=2798649 |doi= 10.1037/0033-295X.96.4.523|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bishop&amp;Snowling"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bishop DV, Snowling MJ |title=Developmental dyslexia and specific language impairment: same or different? |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=130 |issue=6 |pages=858–86 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15535741 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.6.858 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Seidenberg MS |chapter=Connectionist models of reading |editors=Gaskell, Gareth; Altmann, Gerry T. M. |title=The Oxford handbook of psycholinguistics |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-19-856897-5 |oclc=104836761 |url=http://lcnl.wisc.edu/publications/archive/118.pdf |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095926/http://lcnl.wisc.edu/publications/archive/118.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The computation of these three codes (orthographic, phonologic, and semantic) is required for reading. According to Seidenberg and McClelland,&lt;ref name="Seidenberg, McClelland, 1989"/&gt; one mechanism is involved in reading (including reading regular words, exception words, and nonwords). Through development, experience with meaningful words and spelling-sound correspondences allow one’s representation of semantics, orthography, and phonology to be modified. Developing representations of orthography, phonology, and semantics is an interactive process where development of one component influences and is influenced by the other components.

===Dual-route approach===
The [[Dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud|dual-route approach]] suggests that two separate mechanisms, or routes, can be used in word reading.&lt;ref name="Coltheart, Curtis, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coltheart|first1=Max |last2=Curtis|first2=Brent|last3=Atkins |first3=Paul|last4=Haller|first4=Micheal|title=Models of reading aloud: Dual-route and parallel-distributed-processing approaches.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=100|issue=4|year=1993|pages=589–608|issn=0033-295X|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.100.4.589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schurz M, Sturm D, Richlan F, Kronbichler M, Ladurner G, Wimmer H |title=A dual-route perspective on brain activation in response to visual words: evidence for a length by lexicality interaction in the visual word form area (VWFA) |journal=NeuroImage |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=2649–61 |date=February 2010 |pmid=19896538 |pmc=2989181 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.082 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words that follow spelling-sound rules (including regular words and nonwords that follow letter-to-sound rules) are processed through the nonlexical route. The nonlexical route follows a system of rules specifying the relationship between letters and sounds to process words. Conversely, exception words, or irregular words, that do not follow the spelling-sound rules are processed through the lexical route. The lexical route can be thought of as a dictionary lookup procedure.&lt;ref name="Coltheart, Curtis, 1993"/&gt;

===Whole language===
Reading is a linguistic act. With this, some have applied the whole language philosophy to reading instruction. In the early 1990s, a movement for whole language encouraged educators to view learning to read as being similar to learning to talk.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2002"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/pspi/reading.pdf |title=How Should Reading be Taught? by K. Rayner, B.R. Foorman, C.A. Perfetti, D. Pesetsky, M.S. Seidenberg (2002) |format=pdf |work=Scientific America inc. |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;{{cite book|author= J.A. Norris|title=Some Questions and Answers about Whole Language|year=1992|publisher=American Journal of Speech Language Pathology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Norris, Janet |author2=Hoffman, Paul R |title=Whole language intervention for school-age children |year=1993 |publisher=Singular Pub. Group | location=San Diego, Calif. |isbn=978-1-56593-070-4 |oclc=469305849 |pages=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy emphasizes learning language and reading skills through meaningful experiences instead of through decontextualized rule teaching. Some other terms for this approach of reading instruction include literature-based instruction and guided reading.

===Balanced Literacy Instruction===
To meet the recommendations of breadth and depth of literacy instruction set by the National Reading Panel (2000),&lt;ref name="NRP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm|title=Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read|publisher=NIHCD|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194256/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm|archivedate=2008-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; many literacy programs incorporate four main components: guided reading, which focuses on comprehension skills though exposure to a wide range of literature experiences; word study, which incorporates phonics, phonemic awareness, and vocabulary instruction; self-selected reading, which provides children daily experiences in independent reading time; and writing, which focuses on both the mechanics of composition and on communicating effectively for multiple purposes (Foley &amp; Stables, 2007).&lt;ref name="Copeland, Keefe, 2007"/&gt;

==Populations at increased risk==
Children with language difficulties are at increased risk for reading disorders or difficulties that can occur early on in preschool and continue on throughout development.&lt;ref name="Skibbe"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.E. Skibbe |author2=K.J. Grimm |author3=T.L. Stanton-Chapman |author4=L.M. Justice |author5=K.L. Pence |author6=R.P. Bowles  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Reading Trajectories of Children with Language Difficulties from Preschool Through Fifth Grade|year=2008|publisher=Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This population includes children with language abilities that fall below expectations for their chronological age, at a clinical level or with weaknesses in language that are not severe enough to meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis of a language disorder.
Children with other disabilities can also have language impairments that can cause an increase risk of developing reading problems. Such disabilities include (but are not restricted to): [[Specific language impairment]], phonological disorder, [[Language disorder]], [[Developmental disability]], [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]], [[Down syndrome]], [[Fragile x syndrome]], and [[Cerebral palsy]].

People with severe speech difficulties can use [[Augmentative and alternative communication]] (AAC) devices.  The importance and positive outcomes of literacy for people with language difficulties and AAC users are endless.  As with everyone literacy opens doors to education, employment, and allows “individuals to exchange information, maintain interpersonal communication, to convey needs and wants and to develop channels of personal expression". &lt;ref&gt;Light, J., &amp; Kelford Smith, A. (1993). Home literacy experiences of preschoolers who use AAC systems and of their nondisabled peers. Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 9, 10–25 p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, for the AAC user literacy skills may be of even greater importance as reading and writing  “allows individuals with severe speech impairments the opportunity to initiate topics, to develop ideas, to provide clarification, to communicate independently, to interact with a diverse audience, and to express ideas, thoughts, and feelings.” &lt;ref&gt;Light, J., &amp; Kelford Smith, A. (1993). Home literacy experiences of preschoolers who use AAC systems and of their nondisabled peers. Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 9, 10–25 p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, even given the importance of literacy skills people who use AAC are often not given “authentic learning opportunities“ to learn literacy skills.  &lt;ref&gt;Janet M. Sturm Associate Professor, Stephanie A. Spadorcia, James W. Cunningham, Kathleen S. Cali, Amy Staples, Karen Erickson, David E. Yoder &amp; David A. Koppenhaver (2006) What happens to reading between first and third grade? Implications for students who use AAC, Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 22:1, 21-36 p. 21, DOI: 10.1080/07434610500243826&lt;/ref&gt;.  More research is needed on how to increase literacy instruction to people with severe speech difficulties and users of AAC.

==Intervention Team==

==Subgroups of reading problems==

===Difficulties with decoding===
In general terms, individuals who have challenges in decoding are referred to as poor decoders. [[Dyslexia]] is a more specific disability where individuals demonstrate difficulty with decoding. Poor decoders have not acquired the basic knowledge of sound-letter correspondence rules, specifically phonological skills (skills that include identifying and manipulation of words, syllables, onsets, rimes, and phonemes -individual sounds).  In addition, language abilities often evidence poor morphological and syntactic knowledge.&lt;ref name="Catts, Fey, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Catts HW, Fey ME, Tomblin JB, Zhang X |title=A longitudinal investigation of reading outcomes in children with language impairments |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1142–57 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12546484 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2002/093) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Catts, Kamhi, 2011"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Catts, Hugh William |author2=Kamhi, Alan G. |title=Language and Reading Disabilities (3rd Edition) (Allyn &amp; Bacon Communication Sciences and Disorders) |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |location=Boston, Mass |year=2011 |pages= |isbn=0-13-707277-5 |oclc=707726486 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interventions that target decoding abilities may include instruction in [[phonics]], [[phonological awareness]], and [[phonemic awareness]] (also see [[Dyslexia intervention]]).

===Difficulties with reading rate===
Some individuals may have difficulty with reading rate, where they have accurate word recognition  and often normal comprehension abilities, but reading speed that is typically one and a half years below grade level.&lt;ref name="Catts, Kamhi, 2011"/&gt;
Strategies that may improve reading rate include: shared/partner reading, guided reading, repeated reading, and silent reading, listening to another person fluently read (National Reading Panel, 2000;&lt;ref name="Wiebe Griffith"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L. Wiebe Griffith |author2=T.V. Rasinski  |last-author-amp=yes |title=A focus on Fluency: How One Teacher Incorporated Fluency with her Reading Curriculum|year=2004|publisher=The Reading Teacher}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Difficulties with reading fluency===
Individuals may also have trouble with reading fluency, or accurate, smooth, and appropriately paced reading with accurate expression.
Strategies: shared/partner reading, guided reading, repeated reading, and silent reading, listening to another person fluently read (National Reading Panel, 2000&lt;ref name="Wiebe Griffith"/&gt;).

===Difficulties with reading comprehension===
Some individuals may have skills within the normal range on the above factors but may still have trouble with reading comprehension. These individuals are often referred to as [[Reading comprehension|poor comprehenders]], or individuals with a specific comprehension deficit. 
Strategies that can be used to improve reading comprehension include: building oral and auditory language skills, including skills in: vocabulary knowledge, narratives, listening comprehension, and figurative language.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|author1=P.J. Clarke |author2=M.J. Snowling |author3=E. Truelove |author4=C. Hulme  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Ameliorating Children’s Reading-Comprehension Difficulties: A Randomized Controlled Trial|year=2010|publisher=Psychological Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, when working toward increasing reading comprehension for specific texts, one can preteach vocabulary words and discuss prior knowledge on a topic related to the text before reading. (Also see [[reading comprehension]] for more strategies and information.)

===Mixed reading difficulties===
Children can have difficulties in more than one of the areas previously listed.

==Reading in special populations==
Reading difficulties in special populations such as Downs syndrome, autism, and cerebral palsy follow similar patterns of reading development and reading difficulty as described in the subgroups of reading problems section.

===Down syndrome===
It has been found true for children with intellectual disabilities, such as children with [[Down syndrome]], that phonological awareness skills are often deficient and require targeted teaching.&lt;ref name="Kay-Raining Bird"&gt;{{cite book|author1=E. Kay-Raining Bird |author2=P.L. Cleave |author3=L. McConnel  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Reading and Phonological Awareness in Children with Down Syndrome: A Longitudinal Study|year=2000|publisher=American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, studies have found that children with Down syndrome show deficits in phonological awareness, and though they can develop such skills, often rely on sight word vocabulary knowledge rather than phonological awareness skills to decode words.&lt;ref name="Snowling"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M.J. Snowling |author2=C. Hulme |author3=R.C. Mercer  |last-author-amp=yes |title=A Deficit in Rime Awareness in Children with Down Syndrome|year=2002|publisher=Reading and Writing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this, it is recommended that phonological awareness skills be taught in a systematic manner with explicit instruction of how to use these skills when reading.

===Autism===
Children with [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder (ASD)]] have been identified as having particular difficulties with reading comprehension despite normal decoding abilities,.&lt;ref name="O’Connor"&gt;{{cite book|author=N. O’Connor, and P.D. Klein|title=Exploration of Strategies for Facilitating the Reading Comprehension of High-Functioning Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders|year=2004|publisher=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O’Connor &amp; Hermelin"&gt;{{cite book|author=N. O’Connor, and B. Hermelin|title=Two Autistic Savant Readers|year=1994|publisher=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huemer&amp;Mann"&gt;{{cite book|author1=S.V. Huemer |author2=V. Mann  |last-author-amp=yes |title=A comprehensive profile of decoding and comprehension in autism spectrum disorders|year=2010|publisher=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, those individuals who are especially good at decoding but have poor comprehension are considered to have [[hyperlexia]].&lt;ref name="Nation"&gt;{{cite book|author= K. Nation|title=Reading skills in hyperlexia: A developmental perspective|year=1999|publisher = Psychological Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all individuals with autism, however, are poor comprehenders as there is a wide range of abilities in children on the spectrum.&lt;ref name="Nation2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K. Nation |author2=P. Clarke |author3=B. Wright |author4=C. Williams  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Patterns of reading ability in children with autism spectrum disorders|year=2006|publisher = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the type of reader an individual with autism might be, individuals should be given the opportunity to learn to read.&lt;ref name="Mirenda"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. Mirenda|title="He’s not really a reader...": Perspectives on supporting literacy development in individuals with autism|year=2003|publisher=Topics in Language Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Very few studies have examined the effectiveness of interventions for reading for individuals with ASD.&lt;ref name="Whalon"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K.J. Whalon |author2=S. Al Otaiba |author3=M.E. Delano  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Evidence-based reading instruction for individuals with autism spectrum disorder|year=2009|publisher=Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Using computer-assisted instruction to implement programs for individuals with ASD that target skills in decoding could be an effective way to help improve these skills in these individuals.&lt;ref name="Heimann"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Heimann |author2=K.E. Nelson |author3=T. Tjus |author4=C. Gillberg  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Increasing reading and communication skills in children with autism through an interactive multimedia computer program|year=1995|publisher=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Basil&amp;Reyes"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.

===Cerebral palsy===
Children with [[cerebral palsy]] (CP) may or may not have motor speech impairments and/or language impairments,&lt;ref name="Hustad"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K.C. Hustad |author2=K. Gorton |author3=J. Lee  |last-author-amp=yes |title= Classification of Speech and Language Profiles in 4-year-old Children with Cerebral Palsy: A Prospective Preliminary Study|year=2010|publisher=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can lead to reading difficulties. Often children with CP can be classified as having severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI), but children with other disorders can fall into this category as well. Children with SSPI can be at increased risk for reading difficulties not only because they may have language impairments, but also because they can have limited literary experiences and limited reading instruction,.&lt;ref name="Mike"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.G. Mike|title= Literacy and cerebral palsy: factors influencing literacy learning in a self-contained setting|year=1993|publisher=Journal of Literacy Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koppenhaver&amp;Yoder"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.A.

Yoder  |last-author-amp=yes |title= Classroom literacy instruction for children with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI): what is and what might be|year=1993|publisher=Journal of Literacy Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parents and teachers may have low expectations of the child’s ability to become a reader, which may influence experiences with text and impact literacy instruction.&lt;ref name="Light&amp;McNaughton"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Light |author2=D. McNaughton  |last-author-amp=yes |title= Literacy and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC): the expectations and priorities of parents and teachers|year=1993|publisher=Topics in Language Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistive technology (also [[augmentative and alternative communication|Alternative and Augmentative Communication devices; AAC]]) can be used to overcome physical barriers to manipulating books, and to augment speech motor and language difficulties (e.g., type, or select symbols to identify rhyming words), and cognitive impairments (to provide needed support required for target skill acquisition) (Copeland &amp; Keef, 2007, see chapter 9).&lt;ref name="Copeland, Keefe, 2007"/&gt; Of course, access to assistive devices is not sufficient for reading development. Appropriate reading instruction is required (e.g., instruction in phonological awareness skills, phonemic awareness skills, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, text comprehension, and book conventions), regularly conducted story reading sessions, constructive AT/AAC use to target literacy skills, high expectations of student literacy achievement, and text-rich environments have been found to be important for developing literacy skills in children with CP.&lt;ref name="Mike"/&gt;

[[Image:Material safety data sheet.JPG|thumb|250px|An example SDS in a US format provides guidance for handling a [[Dangerous goods|hazardous substance]] and information on its composition and properties.]]

A '''safety data sheet''' ('''SDS'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev04/04files_e.htmlUnited|title=Transport -  Transport - UNECE|website=Unece.org|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''material safety data sheet''' ('''MSDS'''),  or '''product safety data sheet''' ('''PSDS''') is a document that lists information relating to [[occupational safety and health]] for the use of various substances and products. SDSs are a widely used system for cataloging information on [[chemical]]s, [[chemical compound]]s, and chemical [[mixture]]s. SDS information may include instructions for the safe use and potential [[worker safety and health|hazards]] associated with a particular material or product, along with spill-handling procedures. SDS formats can vary from source to source within a country depending on national requirements.

A SDS for a substance is not primarily intended for use by the general consumer, focusing instead on the hazards of working with the material in an occupational setting. There is also a duty to properly label substances on the basis of physico-chemical, health or environmental risk. Labels can include hazard symbols such as the [[Chemical hazard label#Chemical hazard|European Union standard]] symbols. The same product (e.g. paints sold under identical brand names by the same company) can have different formulations in different countries. The formulation and hazard of a product using a generic name may vary between manufacturers in the same country.

==Globally Harmonized System==
The [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] contains a standard specification for safety data sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3514.html|title=Hazard Communication Standard: Safety Data Sheets|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SDS follows a 16 section format which is internationally agreed and for substances especially, the SDS should be followed with an Annex which contains the exposure scenarios of this particular substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidance.echa.europa.eu/exposure_scenarios_en.htm|title=Guidance - ECHA|website=Guidance.echa.europa.eu|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 16 sections are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?val=516832:cs&amp;lang=pl&amp;list=643062:cs,522140:cs,521353:cs,516832:cs,&amp;pos=4&amp;page=1&amp;nbl=4&amp;pgs=10&amp;hwords=&amp;checktexte=checkbox&amp;visu=|title=EUR-Lex - Einfache Suche|date=29 October 2013|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=22 December 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029213855/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?val=516832:cs&amp;lang=pl&amp;list=643062:cs,522140:cs,521353:cs,516832:cs,&amp;pos=4&amp;page=1&amp;nbl=4&amp;pgs=10&amp;hwords=&amp;checktexte=checkbox&amp;visu=|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National and international requirements==

===Canada===

In [[Canada]], the program known as the [[Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System]] (WHMIS) establishes the requirements for SDSs in workplaces and is administered federally by [[Health Canada]] under the [[Hazardous Products Act]], Part II, and the [[Controlled Products Regulations]].

===European Union===
Safety data sheets have been made an integral part of the system of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (REACH).&lt;ref&gt;Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, corrected version in OJ L136, 29.5.2007, p.3).&lt;/ref&gt; The original requirements of REACH for SDSs have been further adapted to take into account the rules for safety data sheets of the Global Harmonised System (GHS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev03/03files_e.html|title=GHS (Rev.3) (2009) -  Transport - UNECE|website=Unece.org|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the implementation of other elements of the GHS into EU legislation that were introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 (CLP)&lt;ref&gt;Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (OJ L 353, 31.12.2008, p.1)&lt;/ref&gt; via an update to Annex II of REACH.&lt;ref&gt;Commission Regulation (EU) No 453/2010 of 20 May 2010 amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) (O.J. L133 31.05.2010, p1-43)&lt;/ref&gt;

The SDS must be supplied in an official language of the Member State(s) where the substance or mixture is placed on the market, unless the Member State(s) concerned provide(s) otherwise (Article 31(5) of REACH).

The [[European Chemicals Agency]] (ECHA) has published a guidance document on the compilation of safety data sheets.

===Germany===
The German Federal Water Management Act requires that substances be evaluated for negative influence on the physical, [[chemical]] or [[biology|biological]] characteristics of water. These are classified into numeric water hazard classes (WGK or WHC, depending on whether you use the German or English abbreviation).
*WGK nwg: Non-water polluting substance
*WGK 1: Slightly water polluting substance
*WGK 2: Water polluting substance
*WGK 3: Highly water polluting substance

=== South Africa ===
This section contributes to a better understanding of the regulations governing SDS within the [[South Africa]]n framework. As regulations may change, it is the responsibility of the reader to verify the validity of the regulations mentioned in text.

As [[Globalization|globalisation]] increased and countries engaged in cross-border trade, the quantity of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous material]] crossing international borders amplified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.spatial.ucsb.edu/janelle/docs/Janelle-globalization.pdf|title = Globalization and research issues in transportation|last = Janelle|first = Donald G|date = 1997|journal = Journal of Transport Geography|access-date = 26 January 2016|last2 = Beuthe|first2 = Michel|publisher = Elsevier Science Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realising the detrimental effects of hazardous trade, the [[United Nations]] established a committee of experts specialising in the transportation of [[hazardous goods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dangerous Goods Digest - The Orange Book of Southern Africa|last = |first = |publisher = Foresight Publications|year = 2015|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee provides best practises governing the conveyance of [[Hazardous goods|hazardous materials]] and goods for land including road and railway; air as well as sea transportation. These best practises are constantly updated to remain current and relevant.

There are various other international bodies who provide greater detail and guidance for specific modes of transportation such as the [https://www.google.co.za/search?q=International+Maritime+Organisation+(IMO)&amp;oq=International+Maritime+Organisation+(IMO)&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1212j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8 International Maritime Organisation (IMO)] by means of the International Maritime Code&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About IMO|url = http://www.imo.org/en/About/Pages/Default.aspx|website =Imo.org|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[International Civil Aviation Organization|International Civil Aviation Organisation]] (ICAO) via the Technical Instructions for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Annex 18|url = http://www.icao.int/safety/DangerousGoods/Pages/annex-18.aspx|website =Icao.int|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[International Air Transport Association|International Air Transport Association (IATA)]] who provides regulations for the transport of dangerous goods.

These guidelines prescribed by the international authorities are applicable to the South African land, sea and air transportation of hazardous materials and goods. In addition to these rules and regulations to International best practice, South Africa has also implemented common laws which are laws based on custom and practise. Common laws are a vital part of maintaining public order and forms the basis of case laws. Case laws, using the principles of common law are interpretations and decisions of statutes made by courts. Acts of parliament are determinations and regulations by parliament which form the foundation of statutory law. Statutory laws are published in the government gazette or on the official website. Lastly, subordinate legislation are the bylaws issued by local authorities and authorised by parliament.

Statutory law gives effect to the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1993 and the National Road Traffic Act of 1996. The Occupational Health and Safety Act details the necessary provisions for the safe handling and storage of hazardous materials and goods whilst the transport act details with the necessary provisions for the transportation of the hazardous goods.

Relevant South African legislation includes the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 (Act No. 85 of 1993)|url = http://www.acts.co.za/occupational-health-and-safety-act-1993/index.html?occupational_health_and_safety_act_1993.php|website =Acts.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Road Traffic Act of 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Road Traffic Act, 1996 (Act No. 93 of 1996)|url = http://www.acts.co.za/national-road-traffic-act-1996/|website =Acts.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Standards Act of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Standards Act, 2008 (Act No. 8 of 2008)|url = http://www.acts.co.za/standards-act-2008/index.html|website =Acts.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SABS - ABOUT SABS OVERVIEW|url = https://www.sabs.co.za/About-SABS/Index.asp|website =Sabs.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been selective incorporation of aspects of the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|Globally Harmonised System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] into South African legislation. At each point of the chemical value chain, there is a responsibility to manage chemicals in a safe and responsible manner. SDS is therefore required by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Health and safety laws update July 2015|url = http://sheqafrica.com/health-and-safety-laws-3/|website = Sheqafrica.com|access-date = 2016-02-10|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A SDS is included in the requirements of Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 (Act No.85 of 1993) Regulation 1179 dated 25 August 1995.

The categories of information supplied in the SDS are listed in SANS 11014:2010; dangerous goods standards – Classification and information. SANS 11014:2010 supersedes the first edition SANS 11014-1:1994 and is an identical implementation of ISO 11014:2009. According to SANS 11014:2010:

===The Netherlands===
Dutch Safety Data Sheets are well known as veiligheidsinformatieblad [[:nl:Veiligheidsinformatieblad]] or Chemiekaarten. This is a collection of Safety Data Sheets of the most widely used chemicals. The Chemiekaarten boek is commercially available, but also made available through educational institutes, such as the web site offered by the university of Groningen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icsds.com/|title=ICSDS, Source of all your needs on GHS SDS for an affordable fee|website=Icsds.com|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2002 - known as CHIP Regulations - impose duties upon suppliers, and importers into the EU, of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2002/20021689.htm|title=The Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2002|website=Opsi.gov.uk|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NOTE: Safety data sheets (SDS) are no longer covered by the CHIP regulations.  The laws that require a SDS to be provided have been transferred to the European REACH Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/chip/|title=Redirect to... Chemical classification|website=Hse.gov.uk|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[COSHH|Control of Substances Hazardous to Health]] (COSHH) Regulations govern the use of hazardous substances in the workplace in the UK and specifically require an assessment of the use of a substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh|title=Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH)|website=Hse.gov.uk|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation 12 requires that an employer provides employees with information, instruction and training for people exposed to hazardous substances. This duty would be very nearly impossible without the data sheet as a starting point. It is important for employers therefore to insist on receiving a data sheet from a supplier of a substance.

The duty to supply information is not confined to informing only business users of products. SDSs for retail products sold by large DIY shops are usually obtainable on those companies' web sites.

Web sites of manufacturers and large suppliers do not always include them even if the information is obtainable from retailers but written or telephone requests for paper copies will usually be responded to favourably.

===United Nations===
The [[United Nations]] (UN) defines certain details used in SDSs such as the [[UN number]]s used to identify some [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] in a standard form while in international transit.

===United States===
In the [[United States|U.S.]], the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] requires that SDSs be readily available to all employees for potentially harmful substances handled in the workplace under the Hazard Communication regulation. The SDS is also required to be made available to local fire departments and local and state emergency planning officials under Section 311 of the  [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act]]. The [[American Chemical Society]] defines Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers ([[CAS number]]s) which provide a unique number for each chemical and are also used internationally in SDSs.

Reviews of material safety data sheets by the [[U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board]] have detected dangerous deficiencies.
 
The board’s Combustible Dust Hazard Study analyzed 140 data sheets of substances capable of producing combustible dusts.&lt;ref name="CSB dust study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov/assets/1/19/Dust_Final_Report_Website_11-17-06.pdf|format=PDF|title=U.S Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, Investigation Report, Combustible Dust Hazard Study, Report No. 2006-H-1|date=November 2006|pages=38, 88-95|website=Csb.gov|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the SDSs contained all the information the board said was needed to work with the material safely, and 41 percent failed to even mention that the substance was combustible.

As part of its study of an explosion and fire that destroyed the Barton Solvents facility in Valley Center, Kansas, in 2007, the safety board reviewed 62 material safety data sheets for commonly used nonconductive flammable liquids.  As in the combustible dust study, the board found all the data sheets inadequate.&lt;ref name="CSB Barton Solvents KS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemsafety.gov/assets/document/CSB_Study_Barton_Final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008015433/http://www.chemsafety.gov/assets/document/CSB_Study_Barton_Final.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the US adopted the 16 section Safety Data Sheet to replace Material Safety Data Sheets. This became effective on December 1, 2013. These new Safety Data Sheets comply with the [[Globally_Harmonized_System_of_Classification_and_Labelling_of_Chemicals|Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals]] (GHS). By June 1, 2015, employers were required to have their workplace labeling and hazard communication programs updated as necessary – including all MSDSs replaced with SDS-formatted documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GHS Overview - SafeTec|url = http://www.safetec.net/resources/ghs-overview/|website =Safetec.net|access-date = 2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SDS authoring==
Many companies offer the service of collecting, or writing and revising, data sheets to ensure they are up to date and available for their subscribers or users. Some jurisdictions impose an explicit [[duty of care]] that each SDS be regularly updated, usually every three to five years.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, when new information becomes available, the SDS must be revised without delay.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''School of Irish Learning''' was a center for Irish studies in [[Dublin]] founded in 1903 by [[Kuno Meyer]], who talked of "the necessity of bringing the [Irish revivalist] movement into direct and intimate relations with scholarship, to provide an avenue for every student of Irish to the higher regions of study and research, to crown the whole edifice by a revival of native scholarship, and thus to bring about a second golden age of Irish learning."&lt;ref&gt;''Celtia'', May/June 1903, p. 83)&lt;/ref&gt; The School's Honorary Secretary was [[R. I. Best]], and among the first students were [[Osborn Bergin]] and [[T. F. O'Rahilly]]. The School published books on language and history which remain standard textbooks for undergraduate courses in Irish, and in 1904 it instituted the scholarly journal ''[[Ériu (journal)|Ériu]]'', of which Meyer was the editor.&lt;blockquote&gt;The principal object of the School was to provide a thorough professional grounding in linguistics, philology, and textual studies for students who had an advanced competence in Irish and Celtic languages. Instruction was for the most part organized in the form of intensive Summer Schools which were conducted by distinguished scholars invited from overseas, e.g. by [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]], [[Henry Sweet]], and [[Rudolf Thurneysen]]. [[John Strachan (Celticist)|John Strachan]] had a more central rôle, almost equal to that of Kuno Meyer himself. Because its activities were organized in this way, and because it had to depend on uncertain sources of funding, the School from the outset had the character of a temporary expedient... Inevitably, the School would become largely redundant once effective undergraduate and postgraduate training in Irish and Celtic languages had been properly established in Irish Universities...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celt.dias.ie/publications/cat/k/k3/hist2.html History of the School of Irish Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Governors and Trustees applied to have the School incorporated into the [[Royal Irish Academy]]; the terms of incorporation were agreed on in 1925, the Academy undertaking to maintain the School's publications in print, and in 1926 the School ended its existence.

'''Straw-bale construction''' is a [[Building construction|building]] method that uses [[straw bale|bales of straw]] (commonly wheat, rice, rye and oats straw) as structural elements, [[building insulation]], or both. This construction method is commonly used in [[natural building]] or "brown" construction projects. Research has shown that straw-bale construction is a sustainable method for building, from the standpoint of both materials and energy needed for heating and cooling.&lt;ref&gt;Milutiene, Edita, et al. "increase in Buildings Sustainability Using Renewable materials and Energy." Clean Technologies &amp; Environmental policy 14.6 (2012): 1075-84.Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of straw-bale construction over conventional building systems include the renewable nature of straw, cost, easy availability, naturally fire-retardant and high insulation value.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

This is a moisture level that does not aid in the breakdown of the straw.&lt;ref&gt;Goodhew, Steve, Richard Griffiths, and Tom Woolley. "An Investigation of the Moisture Content in the Walls of a Straw-Bale Building." Building and Environment39.12 (2004): 1443-51.

==History==
Straw houses have been built on the African plains since the [[Paleolithic]] Era. Straw bales were used in construction 400 years ago in Germany; and straw-thatched roofs have long been used in northern Europe and Asia. When European Settlers came to North America, [[Tipi|teepees]] were insulated in winter with loose straw between the inner lining and outer cover.&lt;ref name=viable&gt;Marks, Leanne R.  (2005).  [http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi?ohiou1125775864 "Straw Bale as a Viable, Cost Effective, and Sustainable Building Material for use in Southeast Ohio".]  Master's thesis, Ohio University.

Straw-bale construction was greatly facilitated by the mechanical hay baler, which was invented in the 1850s and was widespread by the 1890s.&lt;ref name=viable /&gt;  It proved particularly useful in the [[Sand Hills (Nebraska)|Nebraska Sandhills]]. Pioneers seeking land under the 1862 [[Homestead Act]] and the 1904 [[Kinkaid Act]] found a dearth of trees over much of Nebraska. In many parts of the state, the soil was suitable for [[Dugout (shelter)|dugouts]] and [[sod house]]s.&lt;ref name=custersurvey&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/reports/custer_county.pdf Nebraska Historic Buildings Survey: Custer County]  [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/index.htm Nebraska State Historical Society.]  Retrieved 2010-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

in the few places where suitable sod could be found, it was more valuable for agriculture than as a building material.&lt;ref name=laststraw&gt;Hammett, Jerilou and Kingsley (1998).

Retrieved 2010-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented use of hay bales in construction in Nebraska was a schoolhouse built in 1896 or 1897. Unfenced and unprotected by stucco or plaster, it was reported in 1902 as having been eaten by cows. To combat this, builders began plastering their bale structures; if cement or lime stucco was unavailable, locally obtained "gumbo mud" was employed.&lt;ref name=laststraw /&gt; Between 1896 and 1945, an estimated 70 straw-bale buildings, including houses, farm buildings, churches, schools, offices, and grocery stores had been built in the Sandhills.&lt;ref name=viable /&gt;  In 1990, nine surviving bale buildings were reported in [[Arthur County, Nebraska|Arthur]] and [[Logan County, Nebraska|Logan]] Counties,&lt;ref name=arthursurvey&gt;Kay, John, David Anthone, Robert Kay, and Christina Hugly (1990).  [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/reports/arthur_county.pdf "Nebraska Historic Buildings Survey, Reconnaissance Survey Final Report of Arthur County, Nebraska."]  [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/index.htm Nebraska State Historical Society.]  Retrieved 2010-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
including the 1928 [[Pilgrim Holiness Church (Arthur, Nebraska)|Pilgrim Holiness Church]] in the village of [[Arthur, Nebraska|Arthur]], which is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=nomform /&gt;

Since the 1990s straw-bale construction has been substantially revived, particularly in North America, Europe, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Hollis | first=Murray | year=2005 | title=Practical Straw Bale Building | publisher=Landlinks Press | location=Collingwood | isbn=0-643-06977-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revival is likely attributed to greater environmental awareness and the material's natural, non-toxic qualities, low [[embodied energy]], and relative affordability.  Straw-bale construction has encountered issues regarding building codes depending on the location of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Henderson
Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, Vol. 31, No. 3, Ethics and Engineering Design (May, 2006), pp. 261-288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hammer |first= Martin |title=Ten years Later: Strawbale in the Building Codes |publisher=Buildinggreen.com |date= 1 February 2006 |accessdate=4 October 2013 |url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/2006/2/1/Ten-Years-Later-Strawbale-in-the-Building-Codes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, in the USA, the introduction of Appendices S and R in the 2015 International Residential Code has helped to legitimize and improve understanding of straw-bale construction. In France, the approval in 2012 of professional rules for straw-building recognized it as “common technology” et qualifies for standard-insurance programs&lt;ref&gt;http://rfcp.fr/les-regles-professionnelles/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Method==

Straw bale building typically consists of stacking rows of bales (often in [[Stretcher bond|running-bond]]) on a raised footing or [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]], with a moisture barrier or capillary break between the bales and their supporting platform.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Barbara|title=Building with Straw Bales: A Practical Guide for UK and Ireland|publisher=Green Books|location=Dartington, Totnes, Devon TQ9 6EB|year=2002|edition=2011|page=26|isbn=978-1-900322-51-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of straw-bales commonly used, those bound together with two strings and those with three.  The three string bale is the larger in all three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Keefe |first=Chris |title=Straw Bale Design - Choosing the Right Size Straw Bales |url=http://www.strawbale.com/straw-bale-design-choosing-your-bales/ |publisher=Strawbale.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bale walls can be tied together with pins of [[bamboo]] or [[wood]] (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then [[stucco]]ed or [[plaster]]ed, either with a lime-based formulation or earth/clay render. The bales may actually provide the structural support for the building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Malin |first=Nadav |title=Building With Straw Bale |publisher=.buildinggreen.com |date=1 May 1993 |accessdate=5 October 2013 |url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/1993/5/1/Building-with-Straw-Bales/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("[[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]]" or "Nebraska-style" technique), as was the case in the original examples from the late 19th century. The plastered bale assembly also can be designed to provide [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] and shear [[Support (structure)|support]] for wind and seismic loads.

[[File:Lehmverputztes Strohballenhaus.jpg|thumb|left|This straw bale house plastered with [[loam]] [[earthen plaster]] is located in [[Swalmen]], in the southeastern [[Netherlands]]]]
Alternatively, bale buildings can have a structural frame of other materials, usually lumber or timber-frame, with bales simply serving as insulation and plaster substrate, ("infill" or "non-loadbearing" technique), which is most often required in northern regions and/or in wet climates. In northern regions, the potential snow-loading can exceed the strength of the bale walls. In wet climates, the imperative for applying a vapor-permeable finish precludes the use of cement-based stucco. Additionally, the inclusion of a skeletal framework of wood or metal allows the erection of a roof prior to raising the bales, which can protect the bale wall during construction, when it is the most vulnerable to water damage in all but the most dependably arid climates. A combination of [[Framing (construction)|framing]] and load-bearing techniques may also be employed, referred to as "hybrid" straw bale construction.&lt;ref name=MacDonald&gt;{{cite book |last= Myhrman |first= Matts |author2=S.O. MacDonald  |title= Build it with Bales |publisher= Out on Bale |year= 1994 |isbn= 0-9642821-1-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Straw bale house03.jpg|thumb|right|Straw bale construction]]
Straw bales can also be used as part of a [[Spar and Membrane Structure]] (SMS) wall system in which lightly reinforced 5&amp;nbsp;- 8&amp;nbsp;cm (2 - 3") [[gunite]] or [[shotcrete]] skins are interconnected with extended "X" shaped light rebar in the head joints of the bales.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Gary, and Mannik, Henri, "Spar and Membrane Structure" The Last Straw journal, #17, Winter 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In this wall system the concrete skins provide structure, seismic reinforcing, and fireproofing, while the bales are used as leave-in [[formwork]] and insulation.

The [[University of Bath]] has completed a research programme which used ‘ModCell’ panels - pre-fabricated panels consisting of a wooden structural frame infilled with straw bales and rendered with a breathable lime-based system - to build 'BaleHaus', a straw bale construction on the university's campus. Monitoring work of the structure carried out by architectural researchers at the university has found that as well as reducing the environmental footprint, the construction offers other benefits, including healthier living through higher levels of thermal insulation and regulation of humidity levels. The group has published a number of research papers on its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BaleHaus: innovation in straw bale building|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/research/case-studies/balehaus-innovative-straw-bale-building|work=The University of Bath|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically "field bales" (bales created on farms with baling machines) have been used, but recently higher-density "precompressed" bales (or "straw-blocks") are increasing the loads that may be supported. Oryzatech out of Goleta, California has been developing rice straw compressed block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Alex |title=Lego Blocks from Straw |publisher=Buildinggreen.com |date=1 December 2009 |url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/2009/12/1/Lego-Blocks-from-Straw/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Field bales might support around 900&amp;nbsp;kg per linear meter of wall (600&amp;nbsp;lb./ lin. ft.), but the high density bales bear up to 6000&amp;nbsp;kg per linear meter of wall (4,000&amp;nbsp;lb./lin.ft.), and more. The basic bale-building method is now increasingly being extended to bound modules of other oft-recycled materials, including tire-bales, cardboard, paper, plastic, and used carpeting. The technique has also been extended to bags containing "bales" of wood chips or [[rice-hull bagwall construction|rice hulls]].&lt;ref name=Steen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Magwood /&gt;

Straw bales have also been used in very energy efficient high performance buildings such as the S-House&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hans-Peter Petek |url=http://www.s-house.at/presentations.htm |title=S-House |publisher=S-house.at |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Austria which meets the Passivhaus energy standard. In South Africa, a five-star lodge made from 10,000 strawbales has housed luminaries such as Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/five-star-didimala-lodge-is-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-strawbale-building/ |title=Five Star Didimala Lodge Is The World’s Largest Strawbale Building! |publisher=Inhabitat |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Swiss Alps, in the little village of [[Nax|Nax Mont-Noble]], construction works have begun in October 2011 for the first hotel in Europe built entirely with straw bales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mayaguesthouse.wordpress.com/ |title=Blog about the first hotel built with straw bales |publisher=Mayaguesthouse.wordpress.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harrison Vault,&lt;ref&gt;[http://skillful-means.com/pages/details.php?pid=14&amp;photonumber=1&amp;showphoto=vault01.jpg ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621161559/http://skillful-means.com/pages/details.php?pid=14&amp;photonumber=1&amp;showphoto=vault01.jpg |date=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Joshua Tree, California, is engineered to withstand the high seismic loads in that area using only the assembly consisting of bales, lath and plaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/a/tippingmar.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=dGlwcGluZ21hci5jb218dG0tcHVibGljLWRvY3VtZW50c3xneDo1OTU1YWQ2NWU1ODRjNDRj |title=Google Drive Viewer |publisher=Docs.google.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was used successfully for strawbale housing in rural China.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/a/tippingmar.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=dGlwcGluZ21hci5jb218dG0tcHVibGljLWRvY3VtZW50c3xneDozMTcyM2VlMTdlZDQ1MTQ |title=Google Drive Viewer |publisher=Docs.google.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straw bale domes along the Syrio-African rift at Kibbutz Lotan have an interior geodesic frame of steel pipes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kibbutzlotan.com/#!creative-ecology-eco-campus/cg14 EcoCampus, Center for Creative Ecology, Kibbutz Lotan]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another method to reap the benefits of straw is to incorporate straw-bale walls into a pre-existing structure.&lt;ref&gt;Whitty, Cadmon.

''Natural Life'' Sept.-Oct. 2009 Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermal Properties==
Compressed straw bales have a wide range of documented R-value. R-value is a measurement of a materials insulating quality, higher the number the more insulating.  The reported R-value ranges from 17-55 (in American units) or 3-9.6 (in SI) depending on the study, differing wall designs could be responsible for wide range in R-value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/1998/9/1/R-Value-of-Straw-Bales-Lower-Than-Previously-Reported/ |title=R-Value of Straw Bales Lower Than Previously Reported - EBN: 7:9 |publisher=Buildinggreen.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceee.org/proceedings-paper/ss98/panel01/paper04 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710075736/http://aceee.org/proceedings-paper/ss98/panel01/paper04 |date=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bale walls are typically coated with a thick layer of plaster, which provides a well-distributed [[thermal mass]], active on a short-term (diurnal) cycle. The combination of insulation and mass provide an excellent platform for [[passive solar building design]] for winter and summer.

Compressed and plastered straw bale walls are also resistant to fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecobuildnetwork.org/fire-test-video |title=Straw Bale Fire Test Video - Ecological Building Network |publisher=Ecobuildnetwork.org |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with straw-bale==
Two significant problems related to straw-bale construction are moisture and [[mold]]. During the construction phase, buildings need to be protected from rain and from water leakages into the body of the walls.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesustainablehome.net/do-straw-bale-buildings-last/&lt;/ref&gt; If exposed to water, compressed straw may expand due to absorption of moisture. In turn, this can cause more cracking through which more moisture can infiltrate. Further damage to the wall can be caused by mold releasing potentially toxic spores into the wall cavities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=145304|year=2003|author1=Kuhn|first1=D. M.|title=Indoor Mold, Toxigenic Fungi, and Stachybotrys chartarum: Infectious Disease Perspective|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=16|issue=1|pages=144–172|last2=Ghannoum|first2=M. A.|doi=10.1128/CMR.16.1.144-172.2003|pmid=12525430}}&lt;/ref&gt; and into the air.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nachi.org/strawbalehomebasics2006.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In hot climates, where walls may have become internally dampened, internal temperatures may rise (due to decomposition of affected straw). While fire is generally considered a rare event, compressed straw or hay bales have the serious potential of undergoing spontaneous internal combustion.&lt;ref&gt;http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/agriculture/dairy/pastures-management/haystack-fires-spontaneous-combustion Vermin&lt;/ref&gt; Rats and mice can infiltrate straw bale homes during construction, so care must be taken to keep such animals out of the material. Other problems relate to straw dust which may cause breathing difficulties among people with allergies to straw or hay.&lt;ref&gt;http://envibuild.eu/archive/2014/proceedings2014/enviBUILD-2014-proceedings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298811-overview&lt;/ref&gt;

Several companies have developed prefabricated strawbale walls. A passive ecological house can easily be assembled with those panels.

'''Global communication''' is the term used to describe ways to connect, share, relate and mobilize across geographic, political, economic, social and cultural divides. It redefines soft and hard power as well as information power and diplomacy in ways not considered by traditional theories of [[International relations theory|international relations]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Global Communication implies a transfer of knowledge and ideas from centers of power to peripheries and the imposition of a new intercultural hegemony by means of the "[[soft power]]" of global news and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tehranian|first1=Maijd|title=Global Communication and international relations: changing paradigms and policies|journal=The International Journal of Peace Studies|url=http://www.gmu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''study of global communication''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies the continuous flows of information used in transferring values, opinions, knowledge, culture across boundaries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=="International" Or "Global"==
With the end of the twentieth century and the turn of a new millennium, the global arena and the field of international communication were undergoing significant changes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some authors started to use the term global communication because it goes beyond the bounds of individual states and emphasizes communication between and among peoples across borders and, importantly, the rise of transnational media corporations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[International communication]] traditionally refers to communication between and among nation-states and connotes issues of national sovereignty, control of national information resources, and the supremacy of national governments.

Nevertheless, earlier International communication theories have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The old theories only explain part of the global picture and the theories of modernization, dependency, and cultural imperialism have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The term "global", implies a declining role of the state and state sovereignty. As a term, "international" has within it notions of bilateral or multilateral decisions. "Global" could be seen as an aspiration, also as a fear, of the weakening of the state. In addition, global may imply something more pervasive, more geographically inclusive than international. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==

The study of global communication increased dramatically after World War II due to military considerations coupled with their economic and political implications. Earlier attempts at theorizing have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

More global communication research was written in the decade from 1945–1955; most of the research of the 1950s dealt with propaganda and the cold war. By 1970, global communication research had grown to include a great variety of subjects, especially comparative mass communication systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |edition=1st |title=The Handbook of Comparative Communication Research |url= |publisher=Routledge |date=2012-03-21 |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-415-80275-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; communication and national development and propaganda and public opinion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frederick |first1=Howard H. |title=Global communication and international relations |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RBsQAQAAMAAJ|isbn=9780534193447 |date=1993-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of global communication scholars, previous theories of [[Modernization theory|modernization]], dependency, and [[cultural imperialism]] have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication. The old theories only explain part of the global picture.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mcphail |first1=Thomas L. |title=Global Communication Theories, stakeholders, and Trends |date=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Global_Communication.html?id=MAco-KZGZNIC|isbn=9781444358100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological development===
The emergence of global communication technologies may be considered the origin of the field of global communication in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Numerous technical advances such as the creation of a new major global communication phenomenon, [[Telecommunication convergence|convergence]], digital environments and the internet are some of the major engines driving the change from [[international communication]] to global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Global power shifts===
With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union's collapse|Soviet Union]], the shadow of [[Cold War]] has lifted to reveal shifting political, economic, and cultural alliances and conflicts. The increasing importance of these currents, especially in the cultural sphere, demands a reconsideration of the nature of the international communication field within the rubric of international relations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Global Communication in Transition: The End of Diversity?|url = https://www.amazon.com/Global-Communication-Transition-Diversity-Values-ebook/dp/B00YFRD9G6/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450650195&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=global+communication+in+transition|publisher = SAGE Publications, Inc|date = 1996-02-05|first = Hamid|last = Mowlana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News agencies and propaganda===
Three key players are usually recognized as the founders of the international [[News agency|news agencies]]. In 1835, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] created the world's first news agency; In 1849, [[Bernhard Wolff]] started publishing stock market news and daily reports from Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt; In 1849, [[Paul Reuter|Paul Julius Freiherr von Reuter]] established his own commercial service, the [[Reuters|Reuter]] agency, and organized a worldwide exchange of news in 1870.

In 1859, Reuter, [[Havas]] and the German [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau|Wolff]] agency reached an agreement to exchange news from all over the world, which was known as the League of Allied Agencies, or the " Ring Combination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "The Ring Combination": Information, Power, and the World News Agency Cartel|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YDVlAAAAMAAJ|publisher = University of Chicago, Department of History|date = 1999-01-01|first = Alexander Scott|last = Nalbach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, [[Associated Press|American News Agency Associated Press]] was founded and was formally admitted into the "Ring Combination" in 1887.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are some major factors that point to the growing importance of global communication in the world of the twenty-first century:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# world population explosion

# from [[geopolitics]] to [[Gaia philosophy|gaiapolitics]]

# increased [[cross-cultural communication]]
# changing concept of community
# greater [[Centralisation|centralization of control]]
# information explosion
# changes in technologies
# greater dependence on global communication
# greater [[interdependence]] and democracy
# impact of communication on peace and war

== Theoretical approaches and perspectives ==

=== Transcultural political economy ===

Transcultural Political Economy is a concept that is presented in Global Communications by Paula Chakravartty and Yeuzhi Zhao. This concept looks at global communications and media studies in three major areas: global flows of information and culture, decentralizing the conceptual parameters of global information and media studies, and the normative debates in global communications in the context of neoliberalism. Transcultural Political Economy is a multidisciplinary study that focuses on the tensions between political economy and cultural studies. It "integrate[s] institutional and cultural analyzes and address urgent questions in global communications in the context of economic integration, empire formation, and the tensions associated with adapting new privatized technologies, neoliberalized and globalized institutional structures, and hybrid cultural forms and practices". Transcultural Political Economy addresses the issues surrounding the practice of neoliberalism and its creation of unequal power structures within the world system.

=== Globalization theory ===
{{See also|Globalization}}

Globalization theory was popularized in the 1990s as a model for understanding global communication. The concept of [[globalization]] inspired a number of theories from various schools of thought in communication studies that each emphasize different aspects of [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization, development and the mass media |last=Sparks |first=Colin |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7619-6161-1 |location=Thousand Oaks, California |pages=126–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many globalization theories highlight actors in the business sector as leaders in the processes of global integration. Transnationalizing business is often celebrated as progression toward a more interconnected world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Globalization theories are often associated with theories of modernity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some scholars view globalization as the social, political, economic, and cultural integration of societies into a capitalist system; Others see globalization as a successor to modernity, while some see it as an iteration of imperialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some question the usefulness and legitimacy of globalization theory, arguing that it does not adequately conceptualize current international relations or function as a lens through which to examine everyday events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Globalization Theory: A Post Mortem |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/pal/ip/2005/00000042/00000001/art00002 |journal=International Politics |date=2005-03-01 |pages=2–74 |volume=42 |issue=1 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800098 |first=Justin |last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars criticize globalization theories as overzealous toward and unrealistic about the extent of global integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why the World Isn't Flat in International Politics: Enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last=Ghemawat |first=Pankaj |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-205-77876-8 |location=United States |pages=322–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars criticize social theorists for offering opinions and predictions based on theory with little practical evidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In contrast, some scholars work to dispute the pessimistic views of globalization theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Art |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Jervis |editor2-first=Robert |title=International politics: enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last1=Micklethwait |first1=John |last2=Woolridge |first2=Adrian |chapter=Why the Globalization Backlash is Stupid in International Politics |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn= |location=United States |pages=348–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World systems theory ===
World-system theory is a macro-sociological perspective that seeks to explain the dynamics of the "capitalist world economy" as a "total social system". A world-system is what Wallerstein terms a "world-economy", integrated through the market rather than a political centre, in which two or more regions are interdependent with respect to necessities like food, fuel, and two or more polities compete for domination without the emergence of one single centre forever.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfrank, Walter L. (2000). "Paradigm Regained? The Rules of Wallerstein's World-System Method. Journal of World-Systems Research. Vol. 6. N. 2 pp. 150-195&lt;/ref&gt; World-system theory was first articulated by Immanuel Wallerstein. There are three major sources of the world-system theory which conceived by Wallerstein: the Annales school's general methodology, Marx's focus on accumulation process and competitive class struggles and so on, and dependence theory's neo-Marxist explanation of development processes.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barfield (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=&amp;redir_esc=y The dictionary of anthropology, Wiley-Blackwell]'', {{ISBN|1-57718-057-7}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the transnational division of labor, world-system divides the world into core countries, peripheral countries, semi-peripheral countries and external areas. The core countries usually developed a strong central governments, extensive bureaucracies and large mercenary armies, which permit the local bourgeoisie to obtain control over international commerce and extract capital surpluses from the trade for benefits.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Paul Halsall(1997) [https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/Wallerstein.asp Modern History Sourcebook: ''Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral countries often lack strong central governments or been controlled by core countries, they export raw materials and rely on coercive labor practices.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Semi-peripheries which served as buffers between the core and the peripheries. They retain limited but declining access to international banking and the production of high-cost high-quality manufactured goods.[3] External areas such as Russia maintain their own economic systems, they want to remain outside the modern world economy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Modernisation theory ===

The theory of modernization was developed by Daniel Lerner (1958) in the "Passing of traditional society." Lerner's description of "modernised" is an individual having the ability to be empathetic and being able to see oneself in another person's situation. This concept has come from the transition of traditional societies to modern societies, where modern societies is distinctively industrial, urban, literate, and participant. This theory looks at development in a linear fashion, concluding that nations need to develop into a modern society to make it a sustainable and flourishing nation. Developing modernized societies include technological advancement, and developing media sectors to help create a participatory culture.

=== Post-colonialism ===
''See also:'' [[Post-structuralism]], [[imperialism]], [[modernity]],

Post-colonialism is a theoretical approach to looking at literature that examines the colonizer-colonized experience. It deals with the adaptation of formerly colonized nations and their development in cultural, political, economical aspects. Some Notable theoreticians include: [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Edward Said]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], [[R Siva Kumar]], [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[Derek Gregory]].

=== Cultural imperialism ===
Cultural imperialism is a mighty civilization exerts culture influence over another. Less economically prominent cultures often import culture from Western countries, which have the economic means to produce a majority of the world's cultural media, mostly via the global transmission of media.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ketchum, [http://classroom.synonym.com/meaning-cultural-imperialism-7841.html What Is the Meaning of Cultural Imperialism?]&lt;/ref&gt; The weak civilization adopts the mighty civilization's customs, philosophies, worldviews and general ways of life. The theoretical foundations of the academic study of cultural imperialism mostly come from Michel Foucault's concept of biopower, governmentality and Edward Saïd's concept of Post-colonialism, which theories see cultural imperialism as the cultural legacy of colonialism or forms of Western hegemony. Media effect study which integrated with political-economy traditional is the core argument of cultural imperialism. There are two opposite effects of media study. The negative one is that Western media imposes socio-political conflicts to the developing country and the latter one's resistance to the media effects to preserve their traditional cultural identities.&lt;ref&gt;G. K., &amp; Tan. A.S. (1987), ''American TV in the Philippines: A test of cultural impact''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; The positive effects are the issues of the process of civilization such as women's right or racial equality with exposing to Western media.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, J. G., &amp; Morgan, M. (1988). ''Culture clash: Impact of U.S. television in Korea''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; Now the term of cultural imperialism usually refers to America's global culture expansion to the rest of world, which include brand name products, video media, fast food and so on.

=== Communication for development (C4D) ===
[[Communication for Development|Communication for Development (C4D)]] is a [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] oriented aspect of global communication studies that approaches [[Global Development|global development]] with a focus on action and participation for social change enacted through communication systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Evaluating Communication for Development: A Framework for Social Change|last = Lennie &amp; Tacchi|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D underlines "voice, citizenship and collective action" as central values that promote citizen-led development where the visiting party provides guidance rather than direction within the host community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Speaking up and talking back?: Media empowerment and civic engagement among east and southern African youth|last = Tufte, Wildermuth, Hansen-Skovmoes, &amp; Mitullah|first = |publisher = [UNESCO] International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media, Nordicom.|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Göteborg, Sweden|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D often incorporates bottom-up theories of social change with the aim to create sustainable change which is believed to be more likely to occur if the efforts are planned, implemented, and sustained by community members themselves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some development workers and academics suggest that a shared definition of communication for development should be clarified, because disagreement within the field can detract from the characteristics that most scholars view as central to current development, including [[participatory action research]] (PAR).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many C4D projects revolve around media systems as a central site for social change,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which differentiates C4D from other approaches to development. Theories behind C4D highlight that development projects should be contextually situated and that communication technology will affect different types of social change accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Global media studies ===
Global media studies is a field of media study in a global scope. Media study deals with the content, history and effects of media. Media study often draws on theories and methods from the disciplines of cultural studies, rhetoric, philosophy, communication studies, feminist theory, political economy and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan, Daniel and Katz, Elihu (1992). ''Media Events''. London, England: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-55956-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these study approaches, political economic analysis is non-ignorable in understanding the current media and communication developments. But the political economic research has become more resilient because of stronger empirical studies, and the potential connections to policy-making and alternative praxis.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Wasko (2009). Global Media Studies. Television &amp; New Media. Volume 10 Number 1 January 2009 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country has its own distinct media ecosystem. The media of mainland China is state-run, so the political subjects are under the strict regulations set by the government while other areas such as sports, finance, and increasingly lucrative entertainment industry face less regulation from government.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cfr.org/about/ Council on Foreign Relations.]''&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has a well-developed media sector, but the mass media is threatened by the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism which hinder the form of Canada's media identity.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, John A. (1969). ''Mass Media in Canada''. The Ryerson Press. p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the media in America are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenues from advertisings, subscriptions and the sale of copyrighted materials. Currently, six corporations (Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom and CBS Corporation) have controlled roughly 90% of the America media.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Lutz (2012) ''[http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6 These 6 Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America.]'' Business Insider. 14 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Such successes come from the policies of the federal government or the tendency to natural monopolies in the industry.

== Central debates ==

=== Global power shifts ===

[[Frog#Locomotion|Immanuel Wallerstein]]'s world system theory develops a basic framework to understand global power shifts in the rise of the modern world. Wallerstein proposes four different categories: '''core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external''', in terms of different region's relative position in the world system. The core regions are the ones that benefited the most from the capitalist world economy, such as England and France. The peripheral areas relied on and exported raw materials to the core, such as Eastern Europe and Latin America. The semi-peripheries are either core regions in decline or peripheries attempting to improve their relative position in the world system, such as Portugal and Spain. The external areas managed to remain outside the modern world economy, such as Russia.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/wallerstein_summary.php/ Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic types of global power shifts in the 21st century. One is traditional power transition amongst states, which follows Wallerstein's world system theory. For instance, the global power shifts from the West to the East since the rise of Asia. The other is power diffusion, the way that power move from states to non-states actors. For instance, "climate change, drug trade, financial flows, pandemics, all these things that cross borders outsider the control of governments."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/joseph_nye_on_global_power_shifts/transcript?language=en#t-832180/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global public sphere ===
[[Public sphere]] theory, attributed to [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]], is a theory that in its basic premise conceives of [[democratic governments]] as those that can stand criticism that comes from public spheres. [[Public sphere]]s are places, physical or imagined, where people discuss any kind of topic, particularly topics of a societal or political nature. Global public sphere is, therefore, a public that is made of people from across the globe, who come together to discuss and act on issues that concern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of global public sphere is linked to the shift of public sphere, from restricted to nation-state, to made of individuals and groups connected across as well as within borders.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Plato, it can be argued that philosophers have been thinking about versions of a common space for all people to debate in; however, a global public sphere that can fit the description above began to appear much later. In the second half of the 20th century, the legacy of World War II and technological advancements created a new sense of the global and started the economic and political phenomena that we now call [[globalization]]. This includes the expansion of humankind into space, which gave individuals the sense of a global unity, the growth of satellite technology, which allowed for people across the globe to view the same television channels, and the internet, which can provide access to an unprecedented amount of information and spaces to connect with other people.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Cultural industries ===
The term "[[culture industry]]" appeared in the [[post-war period]]. At that time, culture and industry were argued to be opposites.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unctad.org/en/Docs/ditctab20103_en.pdf|title = Creative Economy 2010 Report|date = 2010|publisher = UNCTAD}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural industry|Cultural industries]]" are also referred to as the "[[Creative industries]].

==== Definitions and scope of cultural industries ====

In the present day, there remain different interpretations of culture as an industry. For some, cultural industries are simply those industries that produce cultural goods and services.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the cultural industries are regarded as those industries that "combine the creation, production and commercialization of contents which are intangible and cultural in nature. These contents are typically protected by copyright and they can take the form of goods or services". According to [[UNESCO]], an essential part of cultural industries is that they are "central in promoting and maintaining cultural diversity and in ensuring democratic access to culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.unesco.org/themes/protecting-our-heritage-and-fostering-creativity |title=Protecting Our Heritage and Fostering Creativity |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cultural industries" combines the cultural and economic, which gives the cultural industries a distinctive profile.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In France, the "cultural industries" have recently been defined as a set of economic activities that combine the functions of conception, creation and production of culture with more industrial functions in the large-scale manufacture and commercialization cultural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/Politiques-ministerielles/Etudes-et-statistiques|title = de la prospective et des statistiques|last = |first = |date = 2006|journal = Département des études|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, economic activities involved in the preservation of heritage are also included in the definition of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/87-542-x/2011001/section/s3-eng.htm|title=Defining culture|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global cultural industries ====
Since the rise of the cultural industries has occurred simultaneously with [[economic globalization]], cultural industries have close connections with globalization and global communication.

[[Herbert Schiller]] argued that the 'entertainment, communications and information (ECI) complex were having a direct impact on culture and human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Culture Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science Press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Herbert Schiller|Schiller]] argued, the result of transnational corporate expansion is the perpetuation of [[cultural imperialism]], defined as "the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Cultural Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave of transnational corporate expansion, which began in the 1970s with the emergence of [[Free trade zone|Export Processing Zones]] in developing countries, is focused on the development of [[global production networks]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Creative Industries|last=Flew|first=Terry|publisher=Polity Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7456-4839-2|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=19–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was described as a "new international division of labour" (NIDL) by the German political economists Frӧbel et al. (1980).

Ernst and Kim have argued that GPNs are changing the nature of the multinational corporation itself, from "stand alone overseas investment projects, to "global network [[flagship]]s" that integrate their dispersed supply, knowledge and customer bases into global and regional production networks", entailing a shift from top-down hierarchical models of corporate control to increasingly networked and collective forms of organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Production Networks, Knowledge Diffusion, and Local Capacity Formation|last = Ernst |first=D. |last2=Kim |first2=L. |date = 2002|journal = Research Policy |volume=31|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global media empires ====
The largest firms in media and media-related industries have a very high international profile.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Global media empires such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[News Corporation]], [[Time Warner|Time-Warner]] and [[Viacom]]-[[CBS]] now derive 25-45 per cent of their revenues outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding Global Media|last = Flew.T|first = |publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Basingstoke, UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often argued that the global media are dominated by a small number of powerful media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Herman and McChesney (1997) argued that the global media were "dominated by three or four dozen large [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporations]] (TNCs) with fewer than ten mostly US-based media conglomerates towering over the global market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Global Media: The New Missionaries of Global Capitalism|last = Herman,E.S &amp; McChesney, R.W|first = |publisher = Cassell|year = 1997|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Manfred Steger]] has observed that " to a very large extent, the global cultural flows of our time are generated and directed by global media empires that rely on powerful communication technologies to spread their message."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last = Steger.M|first = |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2003|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that during the last two decades, a few very large TNCs would come to dominate the global market for entertainment, news, television, and film.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Diaspora ===
[[Diaspora]] is often confused with [[wikt:exodus|exodus]]. Diasporas are minority groups that have a sense of connection with a larger community outside of the borders they currently inhabit, and through diasporic media create a sense of a larger identity and community, whether imagined or real.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In scholarly work about diaspora in communication studies, the view of nation and culture as interchangeable terms is no longer prevalent. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] theorized of hybridity, which he distinguished from "old style pluralism", "nomadic voyaging of the postmodern", and "global homogenization". Hybridity is the retention of an original identity and strong ties to an original country and tradition, but with the understanding that there is no unchanged, ideal nation of the past that they can return to. To be hybrid is to also adapt to a new culture and tradition without simply assimilating in it, but rather negotiating a place between the "original" and "new" cultures.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In Communication studies, diaspora is discussed as the identity that unifies people across time and space, sometimes existing in physical spaces and other times existing in imagined 'non-spaces'. However, it has been argued that the concept of 'diaspora' implies ethnic homogeneity and essentializes identity to only ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; One of the most cited and well-known works in the field of diasporic media is [[Hamid Naficy]]'s work on exiled Iranian Americans' creation of cable television in the United States.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Diasporic media refer to media that address the needs of particular ethnic, religious, and/or linguistic groups that live in multicultural settings {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . Diasporic media can be in the diaspora's traditional language or in another language, and they can include news or media from the "origin" country or they can contain the diaspora's local news or media. Diasporic media can be created in radio, television, film, music, in newspapers, magazines, and other publishing, as well as online. It can be argued that the development and spread of satellite television is an instrumental element of the growth of diasporic media today. Satellite television allowed migrants to access the news and popular culture from their homeland, as well as allowing people who speak the same language to access the same channels that might be produced outside of the "homeland"&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diasporic Media Across Europe: Multicultural Societies and the Universalism–Particularism Continuum|journal = Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|pages = 481–498|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/13691830500058794|first = Myria|last = Georgiou|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary studies of diaspora show that diasporic media are part of the change in the tendency Immanuel Wallerstein described in his world systems theory. The world systems theory postulates that much of the flow of people in the world has been from the 'periphery', or economically-developing states, towards the centre; which are often metropolitan, economically-wealthy states that grew their wealth in colonialist entrepreneurship. However, contrary to the movement of people, the flow of information (including media products), has tended to be from the centre to the periphery.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Go with the Flow: Diasporas and Media|last = Sinclair|first = John|date = February 2000|journal = Television &amp; New Media|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Cunningham|first2 = Stuart|issue = 1:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology and media ===
The advancement of media and technology have played the pivotal role in process of [[globalization]] and global communication.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding the media|last = Devereux|first = Eoin|publisher = SAGE|year = 2007|isbn = 9781412929912|location = London, Los Angeles|pages = 28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cable television]], [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], [[digitalization]], direct broadcast [[satellite]]s as well as the [[Internet]] have created a situation where vast amounts of information can be transferred around the globe in a matter of seconds.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

During the early 20th century, [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephony]], and [[radio]] started the process of global communication.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Media, Historic Development of|last = Monroe|first = E. Price|date = 2003|journal = Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications, Volume 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As media technologies developed intensely, they were thought to create, in Marshall McLuhan’ s famous words, a ‘‘global village.’’&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]], the world’ s first [[artificial satellite]], on October 4, 1957, marked the beginning of technologies that would further interconnect the world.  The first live global television broadcast occurred when [[Neil Armstrong]] stepped onto the moon in July 1969.  In November 1972, pay TV caused expansion of cable when [[Service Electric]] offered Home Box Office over its cable system. By 2000, over direct broadcast satellite, a household could receive channels from all over the world. Now with the [[World Wide Web]], [[Smartphone|smart phones]], [[Tablet computer|tablet devices]], smart televisions and other digital media devices, billions of people are now able to access media content that was once tied to particular communications media ([[Input/output|print]], broadcast) or platforms ([[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], [[Film|cinema]]).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Justice ===
Justice in communication studies includes, but is not limited to, the concern with democratic process and fostering democratic publics  {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]] theorized of [[public sphere]] (in ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'') as the space that is created whenever matters of common concern are discussed between the state and civil society. Thus, public sphere includes not only the media, but also public protest in the form of marches, demonstrations, et cetera. There are, however, critiques of political economy in whose view it is impossible to work within the current system to produce democratic publics. Such a critique is that produced by [[Karl Marx]], who saw institutions such as parliament, the state, the 'acceptable' public sphere, economic enterprises, and so on as structurally produced and perpetuated by a capitalist system, and thus they can not be mobilized to change it. In such a system, there can only be illusory justice, which is fair only within the logic of the system. This illusion of justice is produced through dominating [[ideology]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Justice and Communication: Mill, Marx, and Habermas|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|journal = Social Justice Research|date = 2009-02-19|issn = 0885-7466|pages = 134–155|volume = 22|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|language = en|first = Martin|last = Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue of justice in communication studies is the question of decolonizing research methods and theoretical discourse {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . The idea of decolonizing research comes from a rejection of the functionalist approach, which assumed that research can be conducted in a vacuum, free of ideology or the researcher's biases. This approach assumed cultures to be unchanging, homogenous, and isolated from each other. The purpose of decolonizing research and discourse is to 'uncloak' research as an unbiased power structure, and produce research that is more self-aware. The approach in decolonizing research methods attempts to create methodologies that treat the people in the study as participants or partners, rather than subjects - which is a term that in itself carries strong connotations of colonialism. Decolonizing research also involves moving away from Eurocentric models that are assumed to work anywhere else, and instead to create work that is more useful in local contexts. Decolonial approaches specifically seek to produce knowledge about the mechanisms and effects of colonialism. These approaches allow former subjects to 'talk back', which is a reflection of independent agency, on the colonizer's own terms of research, rather than to be 'given' a voice, which is an unequal power structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decolonial Methodologies: Social Justice Perspectives in Intercultural Technical Communication Research|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2190/TW.44.3.e|journal = Journal of Technical Writing and Communication|pages = 297–327|volume = 44|issue = 3|doi = 10.2190/tw.44.3.e|first = Godwin Y.|last = Agboka|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giambologna sabine.jpg|thumb|''The Kidnapping of the Sabine Women'' by [[Giambologna]], in the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in Florence]]
{{Campaignbox Apocryphal Roman Wars}}

'''The Rape of the Sabine Women''' was an incident in [[Roman mythology]] in which the men of Rome committed a [[Bride kidnapping|mass abduction]] of young women from the other cities in the region.  It has been a frequent subject of artists, particularly during the [[Renaissance]] and post-Renaissance eras.

The word "rape" is the conventional translation of the [[Latin]] word ''[[raptio]]'' used in the ancient accounts of the incident. Modern scholars tend to interpret the word as "abduction" or "kidnapping" as opposed to a [[rape|sexual assault]].  Controversy remains, however, as to how the acts committed against the women should be judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Packman ZM |url=http://journals.co.za/docserver/fulltext/scholia/8/1/scholia_v8_a3.pdf?expires=1480217427&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=4ABED64BF8B19FE8D2E3E99593E3DC0D |title=Rape and consequences in the Latin declamations |journal=Scholia: Studies in Classical Antiquity vol. 8 |date=January 1999 |page=34|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
[[File:Cortona Rape of the Sabine Women 01.jpg|thumb|''Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Pietro da Cortona]], 1627–1629.]]
The Rape occurred in the early history of Rome, shortly after its founding by [[Romulus]] and his mostly male followers. Seeking wives in order to establish families, the Romans negotiated unsuccessfully with the [[Sabines]], who populated the surrounding area. The Sabines feared the emergence of a rival society and refused to allow their women to marry the Romans.  Consequently, the Romans planned to abduct Sabine women during a festival of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune Equester]]. They planned and announced a marvelous festival to attract people from all nearby towns. According to Livy, many people from Rome's neighboring towns attended, including folk from the [[Caenina (Town)|Caeninenses]], [[Crustumerium|Crustumini]], and [[Antemnae|Antemnates]], and many of the Sabines.  At the festival, Romulus gave a signal, at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men.  The indignant abductees were soon implored by Romulus to accept Roman husbands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a10 Livy, Ab Urbe Condita Book 1 Ch. 9, p.15].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Livy]] claims that no direct sexual assault took place, albeit the fuller evidence, when compared with the later history, suggests a seduction based on promises by the Romans and then betrayal of those promises. Livy says that Romulus offered them free choice and promised civic and property rights to women. According to Livy, Romulus spoke to them each in person, declaring "that what was done was owing to the pride of their fathers, who had refused to grant the privilege of marriage to their neighbours; but notwithstanding, they should be joined in lawful wedlock, participate in all their possessions and civil privileges, and, than which nothing can be dearer to the human heart, in their common children."&lt;ref name="Livy"&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a9 1.9].&lt;/ref&gt;

==War with Sabines and other tribes==

[[File:Stella, Jacques, The Rape of the Sabines, mid 17th century.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques Stella]], ''The Rape of the Sabines'', mid 17th century, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]

Outraged at the occurrence, the king of the Caeninenses entered upon Roman territory with his army.  Romulus and the Romans met the Caeninenses in battle, killed their king, and routed their army. Romulus later attacked Caenina and took it upon the first assault. Returning to Rome, he dedicated a temple to [[Feretrius|Jupiter Feretrius]] (according to Livy, the first temple dedicated in Rome) and offered the spoils of the enemy king as ''[[spolia opima]]''. According to the [[Roman triumph#The Fasti Triumphales|Fasti Triumphales]], Romulus celebrated a triumph over the Caeninenses on 1 March 752 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a10 1.10]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the army of the Antemnates invaded Roman territory. The Romans retaliated, and the Antemnates were defeated in battle and their town captured. According to the ''Fasti Triumphales,'' Romulus celebrated a second triumph in 752 BC over the Antemnates.

The Crustumini also started a war, but they too were defeated and their town captured.

Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonists]] subsequently were sent to Antemnae and Crustumerium by Romulus, and many citizens of those towns also migrated to Rome (particularly the families of the captured women).

The Sabines themselves finally declared war, led into battle by their king, [[Titus Tatius]]. Tatius almost succeeded in capturing Rome, thanks to the treason of [[Tarpeia]], daughter of [[Spurius Tarpeius]], Roman governor of the citadel on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. She opened the city gates for the Sabines in return for "what they bore on their arms", thinking she would receive their golden bracelets. Instead, the Sabines crushed her to death with their shields, and her body was thrown from a rock known ever since by her name, the [[Tarpeian Rock]].

The Romans [[Battle of the Lacus Curtius|attacked]] the Sabines, who now held the citadel. The Roman advance was led by [[Hostus Hostilius]], the Sabine defence by Mettus Curtius. Hostus fell in battle, and the Roman line gave way. They retreated to the gate of the Palatium. Romulus rallied his men by promising to build a temple to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Stator]] on the site. He then led them back into battle. Mettus Curtius was unhorsed and fled on foot, and the Romans appeared to be winning.

At this point, however, the Sabine women intervened:

{{bquote|[They], from the outrage on whom the war originated, with hair dishevelled and garments rent, the timidity of their sex being overcome by such dreadful scenes, had the courage to throw themselves amid the flying weapons, and making a rush across, to part the incensed armies, and assuage their fury; imploring their fathers on the one side, their husbands on the other, "that as fathers-in-law and sons-in-law they would not contaminate each other with impious blood, nor stain their offspring with parricide, the one their grandchildren, the other their children. If you are dissatisfied with the affinity between you, if with our marriages, turn your resentment against us; we are the cause of war, we of wounds and of bloodshed to our husbands and parents. It were better that we perish than live widowed or fatherless without one or other of you."&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a13 1.13]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The battle came to an end, and the Sabines agreed to unite in one nation with the Romans. Titus Tatius jointly ruled with Romulus until Tatius's death five years later.

The new Sabine residents of Rome settled on the Capitoline Hill, which they had captured in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a33 1:33]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic representations==
Many treatments of the incident combined a suitably inspiring example of the hardiness and courage of ancient Romans with the opportunity to depict multiple figures, including heroically semi-[[Nude (art)|nude figures]], in intensely passionate struggle.

[[File:Johann Heinrich Schönfeld 004.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Johann Heinrich Schönfeld]]]]

The subject was popular during the Renaissance as symbolising the importance of marriage for the continuity of families and cultures. It was also an example of a battle subject in which the artist could demonstrate his skill in depicting female as well as male figures in extreme poses, with the added advantage of a sexual theme.  It was depicted regularly on 15th-century Italian ''[[cassone|cassoni]]'' and later in larger paintings. A comparable opportunity from the [[New Testament]] was afforded by the theme of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]].

=== [[Edgar Degas]] ===
''The Rape of the Sabines''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edgar-degas.org/The-Rape-of-the-Sabines.html|title=The Rape of the Sabines - Edgar Degas - www.edgar-degas.org|website=www.edgar-degas.org|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (after [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]]), c. 1861-1862

"The masters must be copied over and over again," Degas said, "and it is only after proving yourself a good copyist that you should reasonably be permitted to draw a radish from nature." Degas first received permission to copy paintings at the Louvre in 1853 when he was eighteen. He was most interested in the great works of the Italian Renaissance and of his own classical French heritage, hence this detailed copy of Poussin's painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nortonsimon.org/collections/browse_title.php?id=F.1983.06.P|title=The Rape of the Sabines (after Poussin) - Browse by Title - Norton Simon Museum|website=www.nortonsimon.org|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giambologna===
[[File:Florence Rape of the Sabine Women 3.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Giambologna]] at the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]]]]
16th-century Italo-Flemish sculptor [[Giambologna]] sculpted a representation of this theme with three figures (a man lifting a woman into the air while a second man crouches), carved from a single block of [[marble]]. This sculpture is considered Giambologna's masterpiece&lt;ref&gt;Liam E. Semler, ''The English Mannerist Poets and the Visual Arts'' 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-8386-3759-3}}, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended as nothing more than a demonstration of the artist's ability to create a complex sculptural group, its subject matter, the legendary rape of the Sabines, had to be invented after [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], decreed that it be put on public display in the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in [[Piazza della Signoria]], Florence.

The proposed site for the sculpture, opposite [[Benvenuto Cellini]]'s statue of [[Perseus]], prompted suggestions that the group should illustrate a theme related to the former work, such as the rape of [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] by [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]]. The respective rapes of [[Proserpina]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] were also mooted as possible themes. It was eventually decided that the sculpture was to be identified as one of the Sabine virgins.

The work is signed &lt;small&gt;OPVS IOANNIS BOLONII FLANDRI MDLXXXII&lt;/small&gt; ("The work of Johannes of Boulogne of [[Flanders]], 1582"). An early preparatory [[bronze]] featuring only two figures is in the [[Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]]. Giambologna then revised the scheme, this time with a third figure, in two wax models now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London. The artist's full-scale [[gesso]] for the finished sculpture, executed in 1582, is on display at the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]] in [[Florence]].

Bronze reductions of the sculpture, produced in Giambologna's own studio and imitated by others, were a staple of connoisseurs' collections into the 19th century.

[[File:Poussin RapeSabineLouvre.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'', by Nicolas Poussin, Rome, 1637–38 ([[Louvre Museum]])]]

===Nicolas Poussin===
[[Nicolas Poussin]] produced two major versions of this subject, which enabled him to display to the full his unsurpassed antiquarian knowledge, together with his mastery of complicated relations of figures in dramatic encounter. One, now at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], was executed in Rome in 1634–35. It depicts Romulus at the left giving the signal for the abduction.

The second version, of 1636–37, now at the [[Louvre Museum]], shows that, though some of the principal figures are similar, he had not exhausted the subject. The architectural setting is more developed.

===Peter Paul Rubens===
{{main|The Rape of the Sabine Women (Rubens)}}
[[Peter Paul Rubens]] painted a version of the subject about 1635–40. It is at the [[National Gallery, London]].

===Jacques-Louis David===
[[File:The Intervention of the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|''The Intervention of the Sabine Women'' ([[1799 in art|1799]]).]]
[[Jacques-Louis David]] painted the other end of the story, when the women intervene to reconcile the warring parties. ''The Sabine Women Enforcing Peace by Running Between the Combatants'' (also known as ''[[The Intervention of the Sabine Women]]'') was completed in 1799. It is in the [[Louvre Museum]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

David had worked on it from 1796, when France was at war with other European nations, after a period of civil conflict culminating in the [[Reign of Terror]] and the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], during which David himself had been imprisoned as a supporter of [[Robespierre]]. After David's estranged wife visited him in jail, he conceived the idea of telling the story, to honor his wife, with the theme being love prevailing over conflict. The painting was also seen as a plea for the people to reunite after the bloodshed of the revolution.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The painting depicts Romulus's wife Hersilia — the daughter of [[Titus Tatius]], leader of the Sabines — rushing between her husband and her father and placing her babies between them. A vigorous Romulus prepares to strike a half-retreating Tatius with his spear, but hesitates. Other soldiers are already sheathing their swords.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The rocky outcrop in the background is the [[Tarpeian Rock]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===John Leech===
[[File:Comic History of Rome p 010 The Romans walking off with the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|[[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]'s satirical version of The Rape of the Sabine Women]]

The English 19th-century satirical painter [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] included in his ''Comic History of Rome'' a depiction of the Rape of the Sabine Women, where the women are portrayed, with a deliberate anachronism, in Victorian costume and being carried off from the "Corona et Ancora" ("Crown and Anchor", a common English pub sign in seafaring towns).

===Pablo Picasso===
[[Pablo Picasso]] visited this theme in his several versions of the ''Rape of the Sabine Women'' (1962–63), one of which is in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. These are based on David's version. These conflate the beginning and end of the story, depicting the brutish Romulus and Tatius ignoring and trampling on the exposed figure of Hersilia and her child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.principisabini.it/glossario/zoom.php?id=23 La tomba del principe sabino — Glossario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102053759/http://www.principisabini.it/glossario/zoom.php?id=23 |date=2011-01-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Christian Nahl===
[[Charles Christian Nahl]] painted the subject in a trio of works entitled ''The Abduction'', ''The Captivity'', and ''The Invasion''.

==Literature and performing arts==
[[Stephen Vincent Benét]] wrote a short story called "The Sobbin' Women" that parodied the legend. Later adapted into the musical ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)|Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]'', it tells the story of seven gauche but sincere backwoodsmen, one of whom gets married, encouraging the others to seek partners. After a social where they meet girls they are attracted to, they are denied the chance to pursue their courtship by the latter's menfolk. Following the Roman example, they abduct the girls. As in the original tale, the women are at first indignant but are eventually won over.

The story was parodied by Lady Carlotta, the mischief-making character in [[Saki]]'s short story "The Schartz-Metterklume Method".&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Munro (Saki), ''Beasts and Super-Beasts: Beasts'', available at [http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ Read book online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106102640/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ |date=2009-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[midrash]] ''[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]'' (first attested AD 1624) portrays the story as part of a war between the [[Sabines]], descended from [[Tubal]], and the Roman [[Kittim]] ([[s:Book of Jasher/Chapter 17|Jasher 17:1–15]]). A more detailed version of this narrative is found in the earlier mediaeval rabbinic work ''[[Yosippon]]''.

In 1962, a Spanish "[[sword and sandal]]" film based on the story was made, directed by [[Alberto Gout]]. Titled ''El Rapto de las Sabinas,'' the film was released in the USA under the titles ''[[The Rape of the Sabine Women (1962 film)|The Rape of the Sabine Women]]'' and ''The Shame of the Sabine Women.''

The latest adaptation is a [[The Rape of the Sabine Women (film)|video film, ''The Rape of the Sabine Women'']] without dialogue, which was produced in 2005 by [[Eve Sussman]] and the Rufus Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Rape of the Sabine Women: Present at an Empire’s Corrupted Birth|publisher=[[New York Times]]|author=Roberta Smith|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/arts/design/21sabi.html|date=February 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' features a group of all-male players offering to put on a performance of The Rape of the Sabine Women, to the disgust of the title characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/rosencrantz-and-guildenstern-are-dead/summary.html|title=Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead|work=Shmoop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have cited parallels between the Rape of the Sabine Women, the [[Æsir–Vanir War]] in [[Norse mythology]], and the [[Mahabharata]] from [[Hindu mythology]], providing support for a [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European]] "war of the functions". Regarding these parallels, [[J. P. Mallory]] states:
{{quote|Basically, the parallels concern the presence of first-(magico-juridical) and second-(warrior) function representatives on the victorious side of a war that ultimately subdues and incorporates third function characters, for example, the Sabine women or the Norse Vanir. Indeed, the ''[[Iliad]]'' itself has also been examined in a similar light. The ultimate structure of the myth, then, is that the three estates of [[Proto-Indo-European society]] were fused only after a war between the first two against the third.&lt;ref name=MALLORY139&gt;Mallory (2005:139).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Uppsala Conflict Data Program Office at Uppsala University, Sweden..JPG|thumb|The UCDP is located at [[Uppsala University|Uppsala University's]] Department of Peace and Conflict Research (at left) in Gamla Torget.]]
The '''Uppsala Conflict Data Program''' ('''UCDP''') is a data collection project on organized [[violence]] housed at [[Uppsala University]] in [[Sweden]] that has been collecting information on [[armed conflict]] since 1946&lt;ref name="pcr"/&gt; and making it publicly available through its annual report, ''States in Armed Conflict.'' Beginning in Since 2004, the constantly-updated UCDP is also publicly available.&lt;ref name="pcr" /&gt; The UCDP collects both [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[Qualitative research|qualitative data]] on organized violence (e.g., fatality statistics, [[Georeferencing|georeferenced]] event data, and armed actor and conflict descriptions) that is used by [[social science]] researchers, [[journalist]]s, and [[Politician|policymakers]].

==Background==
The UCDP began recording information on ongoing violent conflicts in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="pcr"&gt;{{cite web |author=Erik Melander |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/program_overview/ |title=UCDP Program Overview |accessdate=January 22, 2017 |publisher=[[Department of Peace and Conflict Research]], [[University of Upsala]] |date=nd |location=[[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206111450/http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/program_overview/ |archive-date=February 6, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became clear that more systematic and global data on armed conflicts was necessary for conducting research in the expanding academic discipline of [[peace and conflict studies]].

Initially, the program collected data only on so-called "armed conflicts", defined as fighting exceeding 25 battle-related deaths between two actors of which at least one was a [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/definition_of_armed_conflict/#i |title=UCDP definition of armed conflict |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162625/http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/definition_of_armed_conflict#i |archive-date=2013-07-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, the data gathering grew, and the program also began collecting data on "non-state conflicts" (where neither party was a state) and "one-sided violence" (where an organized group attacked unarmed [[civilian]]s).

The UCDP's data is published annually in such publications as the ''[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|SIPRI Yearbook]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/yearbook/2012 |title=and the |publisher=Sipri.org |date=2012-06-04 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]''. The UCDP also makes its data publicly available through its website and previously in its publication, ''States in Armed Conflict''.

==Organization==
The UCDP is located at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research of Uppsala University in Sweden. The program is led by Associate Professor Kristine Eck, and employs approximately 10-15 research assistants and researchers. A number of scholars and Ph.D. candidates are also attached to the program and tasked with carrying out research for the collection of conflict data. In addition to collecting data, the program disseminates knowledge on trends and dynamics of armed conflict to the public via lectures at academic and government forums.

===Cooperation===
The UCDP works closely with both the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]] (PRIO) and the [[Human Security Report Project]], based within the School for International Studies at [[Simon Fraser University]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. The UCDP collaborates with PRIO to create its datasets and provides the Human Security Research Project with data for its annual publication, the ''[[Human Security Report 2005|Human Security Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security-reports/2012/overview.aspx |title=Overview - Human Security Report 2012 |publisher=Hsrgroup.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UCDP's data is published annually in collaboration with the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] (SIPRI) and appears in the ''SIPRI Yearbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/yearbook/2012 |title=SIPRI Yearbook 2012 — www.sipri.org |publisher=Sipri.org |date=2012-06-04 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Hundreds of scholars have used the UCDP's data for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/publications/Publications_using_UCDP_data/ |title=Publications using UCDP data - Uppsala universitet |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617161647/http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/publications/Publications_using_UCDP_data |archive-date=2013-06-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UCDP couples data collection with research on conflict resolution and the dynamics of conflicts.&lt;ref name="pcr" /&gt; Much of the research done by UCDP staff is published in the UCDP's ''States in Armed Conflict'' annual report, the annual ''SIPRI Yearbook'', and the ''Journal of Peace Research''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/publications/ |title=Publications - Uppsala universitet |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Database==

The Armed Conflict Dataset is a joint project between the UCDP and PRIO that records armed conflicts from 1946–2016 that result in a minimum of 25 battle-related deaths and in which at least one actor is the government of a state. Data is collected by keying specific search words in the [[Factiva|Factiva Database]], an online resource containing over 10,000 different newspapers, newswires, and other sources, as well as published books, case studies, and journals (''[[Africa Research Bulletin]]'', ''[[Africa Confidential]]'', [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] publications). The dataset is updated annually, with Version 17.1-2017 being the most recent.

Every armed conflict is classified as a dyad in the dataset and assigned an ID number. A dyad consists of two conflicting primary parties. Dyads can last multiple years and are coded for intensity level ("minor" for those with less than 1,000 deaths; "major" for those with more than 1,000 deaths), region ([[Americas]], [[Asia]], [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]]), incompatibility (government, territory, government and territory), and type (extrasystemic, interstate, internal, internationalized internal). The start date, end date, year, and location of conflict are also provided as well as the precision of the start and end date.

===Publications===
UCDP data has been published in the ''SIPRI Yearbook'' since 1988. Since 1993, a list of all armed conflicts also appears in the ''Journal of Peace Research''. Data on non-state conflicts appears in the ''Human Security Report'' from 2004. The UCDP has also releases (annually) its own report, ''States in Armed Conflict''. UCDP data is also frequently used by journalists, government agencies, and other organizations to produce overviews of peace and conflict in the world. One prominent index that uses UCDP data is the [[Global Peace Index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionofhumanity.org/gpi/home.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704165325/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/gpi/home.php |date=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset==
A battle-related death is one that is caused by combat between conflicting parties over a contested incompatibility. These deaths can be caused by traditional battlefield fighting, [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla activities]], [[urban warfare]], and any kind of [[bombardment]] of military units, cities, and villages. Guerrilla activities include [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run attacks]] and [[ambush]]es, and examples of urban warfare include [[bomb]]s, [[explosion]]s, and [[assassination]]s. Targets of attacks are generally military, state institutions, and state representatives. However, civilians are [[collateral damage]], and both military and [[Civilian casualties|civilian deaths]] are accounted for in the dataset.

UCDP has three ways of estimating battle-related deaths: best estimate, low estimate, and high estimate. The best estimate is the aggregate of the most reliable numbers for all battle-related incidents during a year. The low estimate is the aggregate of low estimates for all battle-related incidents during a year, and the high estimate is the aggregate of high estimates for all battle-related incidents during a year. These estimates are found in both conflict-year based datasets and dyad-year based datasets. The averages of deaths in the most recent of each kind of dataset are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Conflict-year dataset || bdBest || bdLow || bdHigh
|-
| Average || 918 || 868 || 1,287
|-
| Dyad-year dataset || bdBest || bdLow || bdHigh
|-
| Average || 705 || 666 || 979
|}

UCDP gathers and updates data on a yearly basis. They have datasets available from 1989 to 2016. Every event lists the date of the event, reporting source, primary source, actors involved, place of event, what happened, and the estimates of fatalities. The staff reads all the reports, and the information is entered manually. Furthermore, the aggregate results are compared to figures in official documents, special reports, and news media.

UCDP uses both printed and electronic public sources for gathering information. The main source is the Factiva Database that is composed of over 10,000 newspapers, newswires, and other sources from around the globe. UCDP uses at least one major newswire ([[Reuters]], [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]], [[EFE]]) and [[BBC Monitoring]]. Additional sources include news agencies, newly published books, case studies, journals like ''Africa Research Bulletin'', research reports, documents of international and multinational organizations, publications by NGOs such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], and documents of fighting parties. Sources are judged according to the context in which they are published, and reports are traced back to the primary source to establish reliability.

==UCDP's definitions of organized violence==
The program divides armed conflict into three categories: "state-based conflict", "non-state conflict", and "one-sided violence".

'''State-based conflict''' refers to what most people intuitively perceive as "war"; fighting either between two states, or between a state and a rebel group that challenges it. The UCDP defines an armed state-based conflict as: "An armed conflict is a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in one calendar year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#i |title=UCDP definition of armed conflict |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program's definition differs somewhat from other data collection programs, such as the [[Correlates of War]] Project, which only counts conflicts where at least 1,000 deaths have been recorded during one calendar year. In UCDP, data such an armed conflict is labelled as having the intensity level of "war", whilst armed conflicts that reap between 25 and 999 battle-related deaths are seen as having the intensity of a "minor" armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#i |title=Definition of intensity levels |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-state conflicts''' are those conflicts in which none of the warring parties is a state. Examples of non-state conflicts include the [[Fatah–Hamas conflict (2006–07)|Fatah–Hamas conflict of 2006 and 2007]], [[Ethnic conflict|inter-ethnic group conflicts]] such as the [[Lou Nuer]]–[[Murle people|Murle]] conflict of 2009–2012, and inter-[[Drug cartel|cartel]] violence in the [[Mexican Drug War]].

'''One-sided violence''' is defined as: "The use of armed force by the government of a state or by a formally organized group against civilians which results in at least 25 deaths in a year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#o |title=UCDP definition of one-sided violence |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include actions by the governments of [[Sudan]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Syria]] against civilians, as well as actions of non-state organizations such as [[Los Zetas]], Al-Qaeda, and the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] against civilians.

[[Edward S.

'''Venetian glass''' is a type of [[glass]] object made in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], primarily on the island of [[Murano]].  It is world-renowned for being colorful, elaborate, and skillfully made.

Many of the important characteristics of these objects had been developed by the thirteenth century. Toward the end of that century, the centre of the Venetian glass industry moved to [[Murano]].

[[Byzantine glass|Byzantine]] craftsmen played an important role in the development of Venetian glass,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.about-venice-travel-guide.com/arts-and-crafts-in-venice.html "Arts and Crafts in Venice"] About Venice Travel Guide&lt;/ref&gt; an art form for which the city is well known.  When [[Constantinople]] was sacked by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, some fleeing artisans came to Venice{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}. This happened again when the [[Ottomans]] took Constantinople in 1453, supplying Venice with still more glassworkers{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}. By the sixteenth century, Venetian artisans had gained even greater control over the colour and transparency of their glass, and had mastered a variety of decorative techniques.

Despite efforts to keep Venetian glassmaking techniques within Venice, they became known elsewhere, and Venetian-style glassware was produced in other Italian cities and other countries of Europe.

Some of the most important brands of glass in the world today, including Venini,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venini.com/eng/storia.htm] History of Venini&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barovier &amp; Toso]], [[Pauly &amp; C. - Compagnia Venezia Murano|Pauly]] and [[Seguso]],&lt;ref&gt;Carl I. Gable,
''Murano Magic: Complete Guide to Venetian Glass, its History and Artists'' (Schiffer, 2004). {{ISBN|0-7643-1946-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; are still produced in the historical glass factories on Murano. Barovier &amp; Toso is considered to be one of the 100 [[List of oldest companies|oldest companies]] in continuous operation in the world, having been founded in 1295.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barovier.com/s_company/chi_storia.asp] Barovier&amp;Toso - A Time-Honoured Heritage&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Murano Glassmaking==

[[File:Venetian glass goblet.jpg|thumb|Goblet, 1675-1725, Venice V&amp;A Museum no. 108-1853]]
[[File:Venetian glass.jpg|thumb|Venetian glass in the shop window]]

Murano’s reputation as a centre for glassmaking was born when the [[Venetian Republic]], fearing fire and destruction to the city’s mostly wood buildings, ordered the destruction of all the foundries within the city in 1291.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crouzet-Pavan |first=Elisabeth |translator=Lydia G. Cochrane |title=Venice Triumphant |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=0-8018-8189-7 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Republic ordered the destruction of the foundries, it authorised and encouraged construction outside the city, and by the late 13th century, the glassmaking industry was centred in Murano. Murano glass is still interwoven with Venetian glass.

Murano's glassmakers were soon the island’s most prominent citizens. By the 14th century, glassmakers were allowed to wear swords, enjoyed immunity from prosecution by the Venetian state and found their daughters married into Venice’s most affluent families. Of course there was a catch: Glassmakers were not allowed to leave the Republic. Many craftsmen took this risk, however, and set up glass furnaces in surrounding cities and as far afield as England and the Netherlands.

Murano’s glassmakers held a monopoly on quality glassmaking for centuries, developing or refining many technologies including crystalline [[glass]], [[enameled glass]] (''smalto''), glass with threads of gold (''aventurine''), multicoloured glass (''[[millefiori]]''), [[milk glass]] (''lattimo''), and imitation gemstones made of glass.  Today, the artisans of Murano are still employing these centuries-old techniques, crafting everything from contemporary art glass and glass jewelry to Murano glass chandeliers and wine stoppers.

Today, Murano is home to the ''[[Museo Vetrario]]'' or Glass Museum in the Palazzo Giustinian, which holds displays on the history of glassmaking, as well as glass samples ranging from Egyptian times through the present day.

==The art of glassmaking==
The process of making Murano glass is rather complex. The glass is made from [[silica]], which becomes liquid at high temperatures.  As the glass passes from a [[liquid]] to a [[solid]] state, there is an interval when the glass is soft before it hardens completely.  This is when the glass-master can shape the material.

[[File:Muranobeads.jpg|thumb|Orange Murano beads]]

===Materials===
The other raw materials, called [[ceramic flux]]es or melting agents, allow the glass to soften at lower temperatures.  The more [[sodium oxide]] present in the glass, the slower it solidifies.  This is important for hand-working because it allows the glassmaker more time to shape the material.  The various raw materials an artisan might add to a glass mixture are [[sodium]] (to reduce melting temperature), [[nitrate]] and [[arsenic]] (to eliminate bubbles) and colouring or opacifying substances.

===Colours, techniques and materials===
[[File:Venetian Goblet QM r.jpg|thumb|Venetian artisans use special tools including: borselle (tongs to hand-form the red-hot glass); canna da soffio (a blowing pipe); pontello (an iron rod that helps with adding the finishing touches); scagno (a work bench); and tagianti (glass-cutting clippers)]]

Colours, techniques and materials vary depending upon the look a glassmaker is trying to achieve.  Aquamarine is created through the use of copper and cobalt compounds, whereas ruby red uses a gold solution as a colouring agent. [[Murrine]] technique begins with the layering of coloured liquid glass, which is then stretched into long rods called canes ([[caneworking]]) different color canes are then arranged in a mold to form a design. Then they are heated to fusing temperatures and when fused then pulled (stretched) again like taffy to reduce diameters. Then when cold, these canes are then sliced in cross-section, which show a layered pattern.  The better-known term ''millefiori'' is a way of using lots of sliced murrine that being picked up from the marver by a  gather of hot molten glass. When the amalgam of this type of murrine shows the likeness of many flowers, thus mille (thousand) fiori (flowers). [[Filigree]] (a type of [[caneworking]]), ''incalmo'', [[vitreous enamel|enamel painted]], [[glass engraving]], gold engraving, ''lattimo'', ribbed glass and submersion are just a few of the other techniques a glassmaker can employ many of which have not changed since Roman times (the Romans promoted their glass industry wherever they went).

===Tools===
Murano artisans use the specialised tools of their trade in the making of their glass.  Some of these tools (which under different names have been used by glassblowers since Roman times) include ''borselle'' (tongs or pliers used to hand-form the red-hot glass), ''canna da soffio'' (blowing pipe), ''pontello'' (an iron rod to which the craftsman attaches the glass after blowing to add final touches), ''scagno'' (the glass-master's work bench) and ''tagianti'' (large glass-cutting clippers).

'''Visual research''' is a qualitative research methodology that relies on the use of artistic mediums to "produce and represent knowledge." These artistic mediums include, but are not limited to: [[film]], [[photography]], [[drawing]]s, [[painting]]s, and [[sculptures]]. The artistic mediums provide a rich source of information that has the ability of capturing reality. They also reveal information about what the medium captures, but the artist or the creator behind the medium. Using photography as an example, the photographs taken illustrate reality and give information about the photographer through the angle, focus of the image, and the moment in which the photograph was taken.

==  Research process, a definition and visual images ==

Images are an essential component for different sorts on inquires in a wide range of topics and research questions may call for a visual component in a variety of ways. One way could be to the research questions or the phenomena being examined, or the researcher could be the one making new images. After the visual material is created the resulting collection may be the base of further discussion, interviews, and or analysis, although the process of creating images is often a large part of the research process itself.

== Participant generated visual methodologies ==

This method of data collection is often used to elicit data or opinion, here the participant is the one who would be generating the visual data. If it is a photograph she or he has taken  it, or for a video, she or he has shot the visual data that will be further analysed. This is important as it allows the researcher to understand participants' views and perceptions.
 definition

=== Photovoice ===
Caroline C. Wang and Mary Anne Burris conceptualized the visual methodology called [[photovoice]].  Participants are provided with a camera and asked to produce an image-based account of their experiences and/or those things that are important to them in a particular context. These projects share the assumption that increased participant control of data generation through production of visual images will help to highlight important aspects of lived experience that might otherwise have been overlooked or ignored by researchers. This method is often used in social science and health research.

=== Fotohistorias ===
Ricardo Gomez and Sara Vannini (&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, Ricardo &amp; Vannini, Sara (2015). Fotohistorias: Participatory Photography and the Experience of Migration. CreateSpace, Bilingual: English &amp; Spanish&lt;/ref&gt;) introduced a variation of photovoice called Fotohistorias, that combines participant-generated photos and semistructured interviews to elicit lived experiences of immigrants and other marginalized communities. Fotohistorias combines the power of images and the richness of stories. Together, they yield more depth and sensitivity than either photos or interviews alone. Fotohistorias helps to quickly get to deep conversation about profound and meaningful topics, by focusing on the photos as a pretext for conversation. Fotohistorias helps elicit multiple perspectives and symbols from the same image or place, emphasizing how people’s perceptions and feelings shape meaning and experience. Fotohistorias participants frequently feel empowered, heard and valued, and gain a new perspective and agency over their current situation and context. &lt;ref&gt;www.fotohistorias.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photo-elicitation ===
The photo-elicitation approach can include researcher or participant generated photographs. Photographs are introduced to the context of research interview based off the "assumption about the role and utility of photographs in promoting reflections that words alone cannot." Participant generated photo elicitation puts significance to the participants role in shaping the creation of visual images. It is important to note the value of the technique for "bridging culturally distinct worlds of the researcher and the researched." The term photo-elicitation originated from a paper published by Collier (1957), when it was initiated as a solution to the practical difficulties that research teams were having in relation to agreeing on categories for quality housing. Collier extended the method to examine how families adapted to residence among ethnically different people, and to new forms of work in urban factories, interviewing families and communities with photographs created by researchers. Reflecting on the use of photo-elicitation, Collier (1957, p.&amp;nbsp;858), argued that ‘pictures elicited longer and more comprehensive interviews but at the same time helped subjects overcome the fatigue and repetition of conventional interviews’ and noted the technique’s ‘compelling effect upon the informant, its ability to prod latent memory, to stimulate and release emotional statements about the informant’s life’. Photo-elicitation with researcher-initiated productions has been taken up by a range of researchers across the social sciences and related disciplines (Mannay 2016)&lt;ref&gt;Mannay, D. 2016 Visual, Narrative and Creative Research Methods Application, reflection and ethics. Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film-elicitation ===

This technique of data collection is mostly used by researchers who believe in Positivist or realist view of the world.
Making a film as opposed to simply shooting footages, involves editing and other post production tasks, such as adding subtitles, but it also rests upon a series of ideas concerning the place of visual representation within social science itself. 
This technique of data collection or data analysis is not widely used because of its multiple requirements. 
Making films – to elicit data or opinion, can be of 3 basic types:
1.Documenting or filming the subjects
2.Showing a film to the subjects and asking about their opinion 
3.Asking the subjects to make a film

There are 3 basic concerns when it comes to analysis of a film or a video: 
1. the analytical approach taken towards film or video.
2. method employed to derive data.
3. the kind of issue being analysed.

=== Benefits and limitations ===

This methodology is beneficial in its applicability to participants who may be [[illiterate]] or have difficulty communicating because of [[language barrier]]s, lack of education, or a disability. This characteristic of Photovoice allows researchers who choose to use this methodology to choose participants from a large sample pool because there are no language or literacy requirements. Photovoice may be a powerful research tool because it allows the researcher to see the topic being studied from the participant's perspective. It also encourages the participants and the researcher to reflect on the images and meaning behind them as they highlight an aspect or perspective of the research topic perhaps not previously considered. In this way visual methods of data production can act as tools of defamilairisation, fighting familiarity for both researchers and participants and allowing space for a more nuanced understanding of the topics studies (Mannay 2010)&lt;ref&gt;Mannay, D. 2010. Making the familiar strange: Can visual research methods render the familiar setting more perceptible?. Qualitative Research 10(1), pp. 91-111&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The use of Photovoice also has its limits. It requires the researcher to budget for the equipment used to carry it out, such as cameras, ink and printing costs. This may be problematic for the researcher if the research has been given limited or insufficient funds.
 
Another problem that may arise in the use of Photovoice is the question of photograph ownership. The researcher may be providing the equipment, but it is the participants who are taking the pictures. To avoid any potential issues regarding photograph ownership, it is advised that researchers obtain from their participants permission to use the photographs they take. It is particularly important to think carefully about informed consent in an era of digital dissemination and open access publication where images can be reworked, redistributed and recirculated in the digital economy, in ways that may not have been envisaged at the time of the research study (Mannay, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Mannay, D. 2014. Story telling beyond the academy: exploring roles, responsibilities and regulations in the Open Access dissemination of research outputs and visual data. The Journal of Corporate Citizenship 54, pp. 109-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical warnings ==

=== Deception or manipulation ===

These are activities where the experimenters are either not disclosing their real identity, or their true purpose for the activity.  This includes assuming a [[pseudonym|false identity]] such as creating an avatar in an online game, or pretending to be a tourist while looking at statutes. This could also includes manipulating settings in order to observe reactions.

=== Observing and objectifying people by looking covertly from a distance ===

These activities concern individuals who feel that a particular population is being treated in a dispassionate manner or similar to scientists observing natural phenomena in a clinical way. Examples of this would be the exercises which you ask to observe the waiting behaviors of people in public places (either in person from a distance or via [[webcam]]).

=== Intimate or detailed observations of personal places or behavior ===

This category refers to a in-depth analysis of intimate, meaningful or personal places activities or spaces, and may include making judgments which could sadden or offend people. An example of this could be coding or commenting on gravestone trends or personal graffiti.

=== Possibility of causing discomfort or concern ===

This is a category, in which the exercise or project may upset some people, or create anxiety or fear (including and potentially, in the researcher). This may happen due to situations which could include wasting people's time or not conforming to societal norms, such as in 'breaching' experiments. The visual offers a range of exciting possibilities for social research but it also brings an array of challenges and ethical difficulties. Visual Ethics can now be regarded as a specialist area within visual methodologies. Much mainstream engagement with the ethics of visual ethnography focuses on issues of anonymity of place and participants so that the focus is on who is taking the picture, who is in the picture; and what else can be known from the geography or materiality of the image. Thus, the moral maze of image ethics has been centrally concerned with the creator of images in relation to informed consent and the tension between revealing and concealing the contents of visual images; and who has ‘the right’ to claim ownership of images to in turn edit their content and show them to others (Mannay 2016).Once a visual image is created it becomes very difficult to control its use or remove it from the public arena if participants decide that they no longer want to be represented in a fixed visual trope for time immemorial. Even if images are successfully anodised, acts to disguise images can be seen as tantamount to silencing the voice of research participants. This is particularly problematic where researchers invest in the epistemological aims of participatory approaches predicated on giving ‘voice’.

'''''Worldwide Day of Play''''' is an annual event designed to encourage children and parents to turn off the television and play, especially outdoors. The yearly event officially began on all US Nickelodeon channels: [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids|Nick GAS]] (until 2008), [[Nick Jr.|Noggin]] (now [[Nick Jr.]]), [[TeenNick|The N]] (now [[TeenNick]]), [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] and [[NickMusic]] on October 1, 2005. The event was first shown on October 2, 2004 on Nickelodeon. Some foreign versions of Nick also participated. The event is designed as a finale for Nick's six-month-long '''Let's Just Play''' campaign. In addition, Nick.com would also have special features for children to learn how to stay active and healthy.

==General purpose==
The event encourages children to think about getting away from the TV and being physically active. Schools and educational organizations have also been encouraged to host events around this theme.

As it has since 2004 (except 2018), Nickelodeon will suspend programming on WWDoP across all of its TV channels–Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Nicktoons and TeenNick– and websites from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. (ET/PT) (where TV grid listings have this listed as "[[Off-the-air|Off air]]" or "Worldwide Day of Play") urging kids to “get up, go outside and play.”  According to Viacom, the owner of the Nickelodeon networks, millions of children and adults are expected to participate in "thousands of events in dozens of countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickpress-worldwidedayofplay.com/|publisher=Viacom International Inc|title=NICKELODEON TO CELEBRATE 10TH ANNUAL WORLDWIDE DAY OF PLAY WITH FLAGSHIP EVENT IN BROOKLYN’S PROSPECT PARK ON SEPT. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ''Let's Just Play'' campaign ended in September, Nickelodeon aired the finale during the last Saturday of September, the "Worldwide Day of Play". Nickelodeon and its sister channels suspend programming for three hours from 12 Noon to 3PM ET/PT. During the time there was no programming, a special message would appear on the screen. There was no ''Let's Just Play'' campaign in 2008, though the Day of Play was held that year.

Nickelodeon's 15th WWDoP will be taking place on September 29, 2018, but there is no "Off-Air" screen this year on the Nick networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickpress.com/press-releases/2018/05/23/nickelodeon-kicks-off-summer-celebration-of-play-bringing-worldwide-day-of-play-events-to-cities-across-the-country|publisher=Viacom International Inc|title=NICKELODEON KICKS OFF SUMMER CELEBRATION OF PLAY, BRINGING WORLDWIDE DAY OF PLAY EVENTS TO CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New episodes of Nickelodeon series==
After Nickelodeon resumes airing, they usually air marathons and premieres of [[TeenNick]] series, or ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. In 2007, ''SpongeBob SquarePants'', ''[[Just Jordan]]'', ''[[Tak and the Power of Juju (TV series)|Tak and the Power of Juju]]'', ''[[Zoey 101]]'', ''[[iCarly]]'', ''[[Back at the Barnyard]]'' had new episodes.  Following in 2008 was the season premiere of ''iCarly'' and the finale of ''[[My Family's Got GUTS]]''. Following in 2009 and 2010, ''iCarly'' and ''[[True Jackson, VP]]'', and ''[[Big Time Rush]]'' had new episodes, with the inclusion of Nickelodeon's rebrand. Later followed in 2011, new episodes of ''iCarly'', ''Big Time Rush'' and ''[[Supah Ninjas]]'' aired. In 2012, before the Worldwide Day of Play begin, new episodes of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' and ''[[Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness]]'' aired as well with an hour-long final season premiere of "iCarly" later that night with a sneak peek of See Dad Run following iCarly. For 2013, new episodes of ''[[Sanjay and Craig]]'' and ''[[Rabbids Invasion]]'' aired prior to the event, while premieres of ''[[Sam &amp; Cat]]'' and ''[[The Haunted Hathaways]]'' were shown that evening. In 2014, new episodes of ''Sanjay And Craig'' and ''[[Breadwinners (TV series)|Breadwinners]]'' were shown prior to the event, while new episodes of ''The Haunted Hathaways'', ''[[Henry Danger]]'', ''[[Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn]]'', ''[[The Thundermans]]'', and ''[[AwesomenessTV (TV series)|AwesomenessTV]]'' were shown in the evening. In 2015, new episodes of Henry Danger, Game Shakers, and 100 Things To Do Before High School had aired that evening. In 2016, season premieres of Henry Danger, Game Shakers, &amp; School Of Rock had aired that evening. In 2017, new episodes of Henry Danger and Game Shakers had aired that evening.

'''Zurich University of the Arts''' (ZHdK, {{lang-de|'''Zürcher Hochschule der Künste'''}}) has approximately 2,500 students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK)|url=http://www.cumulusassociation.org/component/members/view/110|work= cumulusassociation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes it the largest arts university in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Departement Design &amp; Art Education Zurich University of the Arts|url=http://www.cumulusassociation.org/component/members/view/110|work= cumulusassociation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was established in 2007, following the merger between Zurich’s School of Art and Design (HGKZ) and the School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT). ZHdK is one of four universities affiliated to [[Zürcher Fachhochschule]].

ZHdK offers Bachelor’s and master's degree courses and further education programmes in [[art]], [[design]], [[music]], [[art education]], [[theatre]], [[film]], [[dance]], transdisciplinary studies as well as PhD programmes in collaboration with different international Art Uniuversities and with [[ETH Zurich]]. ZHdK holds an active role in research, especially in artistic research and design research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zürcher Hochschule der Künste|url=http://www.eenc.info/fr/organisation/zurich-university-of-the-arts/|work= eenc.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affiliated to ZHdK are the [[Museum of Design, Zurich]], the Theater der Künste (Theatre of the Arts), the Mehrspur Music Club, and the Media and Information Centre (MIZ).

== History ==
Established on 1 August 2007, Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) resulted from the merger between the [[Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst Zürich]] (HGKZ), which had arisen from the [[Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich]] (founded in 1878), and the School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zurich University of the Arts Universities Handbook |url=http://www.universitieshandbook.com/directory/canton-zurich/zurich-university-of-the-arts |work= universitieshandbook.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501144050/http://www.universitieshandbook.com/directory/canton-zurich/zurich-university-of-the-arts |archivedate=May 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding president of the new arts university was Professor Hans-Peter Schwarz. Since November 2009, Professor Thomas D. Meier has been president of ZHdK.

The Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst Zürich (HGKZ) arose from the [[Kunstgewerbeschule]] Zürich (founded in 1878). It was located in a building constructed by architects Adolf Steger and Karl Egender, which today also houses the [[Museum of Design, Zurich]].

The School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT) was the result of a merger in 1999 between Winterthur and Zurich conservatories of music, Zurich’s Jazz School, Zurich’s Theatre and Acting Academy, and the Swiss Professional Ballet School. ZHdK’s programme in Theatre Studies (affiliated to the Department of Performing Arts and Film) was originally established in 1937, in the context of the [[Schauspielhaus Zürich]] (the city’s principal theatre), and known as the  Bühnenstudio Zürich. It was renamed Schauspiel-Akademie Zürich in the early 1970s.

Following the 2007 school merger, ZHdK occupies 35 sites, spread across the cities of Zurich (Ausstellungsstrasse, Florhof, Mediacampus, Gessnerallee) and Winterthur. In the autumn of 2014, ZHdK will be relocating to its new campus: the Toni Areal (under construction) in the city’s thriving western district ([[Zurich West]]). With the exception of its Gessnerallee annex, ZHdK will be leaving all other sites to unite the arts under one roof. The [[Museum of Design, Zurich]] and the Bellerive Museum will remain at their current locations.

== Teaching and research ==
ZHdK offers taught Bachelor’s and master's degree courses, which have replaced the former diploma courses in the wake of the [[Bologna Process]]. Places on all degree courses are limited. The university also offers a foundation course in art and design and various further educating courses, leading either to a Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) or a Master of Advanced Studies (MAS).

With research becoming more firmly established at universities of applied sciences, ZHdK has significantly intensified its research activities. Its seven research institutes and two centres of excellence focus on artistic research in particular. Research is also undertaken in the fields of [[design]], [[art history]], art education, and [[musicology]]. And, ZhdK is also running several joint PhD programmes in cooperation with national and international universities.

== Departments ==
ZHdK has five departments:

The '''Department of Music''' is the largest department at ZHdK. It provides instrumental and voice training in Classical, Jazz, and Popular Music, as well as programmes in conducting and composition. The department also includes the Institute for Computer Music and Sound Technology (ICST) and undertakes specialised research in music interpretation. The department has its own record label, ZHdK Records, through which first-class in-house productions are released. CDs are distributed by Phonag Records.

The '''Department of Performing Arts and Film''' offers taught degrees and professional training in theatre (acting, directing, dramaturgy, scenography, theatre education), film, and dance. The department also includes the Institute for Performing Arts and Film (IPF).

The '''Department of Art &amp; Media''' offers various taught degrees in fine arts, with focuses on painting/drawing, photography, installation/sculpture, video/moving images, sound, performance, language,digitality, and practices of aesthetic theory in its BFA programme and focuses in Fine Arts, Language, Curating and Aesthetic Theory in its MFA programme The department includes the Institute for Contemporary Art Research (IFCAR) and the Public City Centre of Excellence as well as a PhD programme (in collaboration with Kunstuniversität Linz/Austria).

The '''Department of Cultural Analysis''' provides training for future drawing teachers, cultural journalists, exhibition-makers, and adult education specialists. The department also offers a Master of Arts in Transdisciplinary Studies and has several affiliated research institutes —Institute for Theory (ith), Institute for Art Education (IAE), and Institute for Cultural Studies in the Arts (ICS). Among others, research focuses on transdisciplinarity.

The '''Department of Design''' offers degree programs in Cast/Audiovisual Media, [http://gamedesign.zhdk.ch Game Design], [http://vid.zhdk.ch Industrial Design], [http://iad.zhdk.ch Interaction Design], Trends &amp; Identity, [http://kvis.zhdk.ch Knowledge Visualization] and [http://vvk.zhdk.ch Visual Communication]. The department also includes the Institute for Design Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zurich University of the Arts|url=http://www.sharenetwork.eu/artistic-research-overview/switzerland/zurich-university-of-the-arts|work= sharenetwork.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
