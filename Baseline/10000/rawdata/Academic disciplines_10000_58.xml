'''Arlene Blum''' (born March 1, 1945&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;Breaking Trail: A Climbing Life, page 344 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ra3565NlWLsC&amp;pg=PA344 Chapter 24 ]&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American [[mountaineering|mountaineer]], writer, and [[environmental health|environmental health scientist]]. She is best known for leading an all-woman ascent of [[Annapurna]] (I), a climb that was also the first successful American ascent. She was also a deputy leader of the first all-woman ascent of [[Mount Denali]] and the first American woman to attempt to ascend [[Mount Everest]]&lt;ref name="BA1"&gt;Blum, Arlene. Personal Interview. December 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and Executive Director of the [http://greensciencepolicy.org/ Green Science Policy Institute].

==Start in mountaineering==
Blum was born in [[Davenport, Iowa]], and raised from the age of five on in Chicago by her [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] mother and grandparents.&lt;ref name="birth" /&gt; In the early 1960s, she attended [[Reed College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Her first climb was in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], where she failed to reach the summit of [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]]. However, she persevered, climbing throughout her college days. She was rejected from an Afghanistan expedition in 1969, with its leader writing to her, "One woman and nine men would seem to me to be unpleasant high on the open ice, not only in excretory situations but in the easy masculine companionship which is so vital a part of the joy of an expedition."&lt;ref name="jwa.org"/&gt; In 1970, she requested to join a high altitude expedition, but was told that she was welcome to come as far as the base camp to "help with the cooking."&lt;ref name="jwa.org"&gt;http://jwa.org/blog/climb-every-mountain&lt;/ref&gt; However, she was able to go climbing as part of her research for her senior thesis, which was on the topic of volcanic gases on [[Oregon]]'s [[Mount Hood]]. Blum graduated from Reed and attended [[MIT]] and [[UC Berkeley]], where she earned a PhD in [[Biophysics|biophysical chemistry]] in 1971. After graduate school, Blum embarked on what she called the "endless winter" – spending more than a year climbing peaks all over the world.

==Major climbs==
As deputy leader, Blum was part of the first all-woman team to ascend [[Alaska]]'s [[Mount Denali]] in 1970. She participated in a 1976 expedition up [[Mount Everest]] as part of the [[American Bicentennial]] Everest Expedition, but did not reach the summit. In 1978, she organized a team of eleven women to climb [[Annapurna]] (I) in [[Nepal]] which, until then, had been climbed by only eight people (all men). It was called American Women's Himalayan Expeditions – Annapurna. They raised money for the trip in part by selling T-shirts with the slogan "A woman's place is on top". The first summit team, comprising [[Vera Komarkova]] and [[Irene Miller]] and [[Sherpas]] [[Mingma Tsering]] and [[Chewang Ringjing]], reached the top at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on October 15, 1978. The second summit team, [[Alison Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz]] and [[Vera Watson]], died during this climb. After the event, Blum wrote a book about her experience on Annapurna, called ''Annapurna: A Woman's Place''.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Arlene, ''Annapurna: A Woman's Place'' (Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, 1980) {{ISBN|0-87156-236-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She led the first expedition to climb [[Bhrigupanth]] in the Indian [[Himalayas]], leading a team of Indian and American women. She then attempted what she called the "Great Himalayan Traverse", a two-thousand-mile journey across the treacherous but beautiful peaks of the Himalayas from [[Bhutan]] to India. She crossed the [[Alps]] from [[Yugoslavia]] to France, bearing her baby Annalise on her back in a backpack.

==Current science policy work==
As a researcher at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in the late 1970s, Blum's research contributed to the regulation of two cancer-causing chemicals used as flame retardants on children's sleepwear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml77/77030.html CPSC Bans TRIS-Treated Children's Garments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320211451/http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml77/77030.html |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blum taught at [[Stanford University]], [[Wellesley College]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

After a long hiatus, Blum returned to science and policy work in 2006—when her daughter started college—and her memoir ''Breaking Trail: A Climbing Life'' ({{ISBN|0156031167}}) was published. She discovered that the same [[Tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate|Tris]] her research had helped remove from children's pajamas was back in California couches and baby products.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/business/18chemical.html?pagewanted=all Chemical Suspected in Cancer Is in Baby Products]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Blum co-founded the Green Science Policy Institute (GSP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://greensciencepolicy.org/ Green Science Policy Institute (GSP)]&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of bringing scientific research results into policy decisions to protect human health and the environment from toxic chemicals. As executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute, Blum and her team have led several successful national and international campaigns against the use of toxic chemicals, particularly halogenated [[flame retardants]].

Blum has published articles about science policy in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', and ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' magazine.

===Current GSP projects===
* Helping create safer standards for consumer products, including bedding materials, furniture, and baby products.
* Reducing the use of toxic chemicals in buildings by informing architects and builders of alternative materials, building codes, and the adverse health effects associated with exposure to [[flame retardants]].
* Working with Chinese scientists, industry leaders, academics, and government to create greater awareness of the growing chemical-flame-retardant industry in China.
* Conducting research on exposure to toxic chemicals and health of fire fighters, flight attendants, and U.S. and Chinese workers.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Arlene. [http://greensciencepolicy.org/our-mission-and-goals "Our Mission and Goals."] Green Science Policy Institute. December 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and awards==
Her first book, ''[[Special: BookSources/1578050227|Annapurna: A Woman's Place]]'' was included in [[Fortune Magazine]]'s 2005 list of "The 75 Smartest Business Books We Know" and chosen by ''[[National Geographic Adventure Magazine]]'' as one of the 100 top adventure books of all time. Her award-winning memoir, ''[[Special: BookSources/0156031167|Breaking Trail: A Climbing Life]]'' tells the story of how Blum realized improbable dreams among the world's highest mountains, in the chemistry laboratory, and in public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blum|first1=Arlene; foreword by Maurice Herzog|title=Annapurna, a woman's place|date=1998|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=1-57805-022-7|edition=20th anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blum's books can also be viewed as works that contribute to showing the hardships faced by women geographers in a male dominated field (at that time).

Blum's awards include a Purpose Prize&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purposeprize.org/video/yt_video.cfm?candidateID=3527 Purpose Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; to those over 60 who are solving society's greatest problems, National Women's History Project selection as one of "100 Women Taking the Lead to Save Our Planet"&lt;ref name="WHM"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2010 | title=Honorees: 2010 National Women's History Month | work=Women's History Month | publisher=[[National Women's History Project]] | url=http://nwhp.org/whm/honorees.php | accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Gold Medal from the Society of Women Geographers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iswg.org/ Society of Women Geographers]&lt;/ref&gt; an honor previously given to only eight other women including Amelia Earhart, Margaret Mead, and Mary Leakey. ''Breaking Trail'' received an Honorable Mention from the [[National Outdoor Book Award]] in 2005.

Arlene Blum is the founder of the annual Berkeley Himalayan Fair and the Burma Village Assistance Project. She serves on the boards of the Society for the Preservation of Afghan Archeology; ISET, an organization dedicated to solving climate, water and disaster problems in South Asia; and the advisory boards for Project REED
which builds libraries in Asia, Environmental Building News, and the [[Plastic Pollution Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Arlene. [http://www.arleneblum.com/about.html "About Arlene Blum."] Arlene Blum. December 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Blum was the winner of the Sierra Club's [[Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award]] for 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sierraclub.org/awards/downloads/award_sr.pdf Sierra Club Awards] – List by Award&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, 2012, the [[American Alpine Club]] inducted Blum into its Hall of Mountaineering Excellence at an award ceremony in [[Golden, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Quotes==

*"With a global and virtual expedition team, we are attempting challenging and important mountains and reaching for the summit of a healthier world to benefit us all."&lt;br&gt;—Purpose Prize profile&lt;ref name="WF1"&gt;[http://www.encore.org/prize/nominate?ref=candidatepage.cfm?candidateid=3527 "Winners and Fellows: Arlene Blum." Encore Careers: The Purpose Prize.] December 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The health and environmental problem from such chemicals could be as threatening as climate change, but I believe it is a problem that can be solved relatively easily. It's a matter of informing the public – and political will."&lt;br&gt;—Purpose Prize profile&lt;ref name="WF1"/&gt;
*"My new adventure in science and policy work is the most challenging and important of my life and I feel lucky to look out at the horizon and see endless rows of mountains to climb."&lt;br&gt;—Reed 100th Anniversary Festschrift Volume&lt;ref name="BA1"/&gt;
*"In America, foods, drugs and pesticides are regulated, you may say they are not well enough regulated, but you really have to provide information because those are the things that go into our mouths. Other chemicals like flame retardants are not regulated, there are not really health requirements but they go into our bodies the same way." -Arlene Blum, as interviewed in [[Stink!]] Movie

==Personal life==

Blum lives and works in [[Berkeley, California]]. She has a daughter, Annalise Blum, a 2010 graduate of [[Stanford University]] in environmental engineering.

'''Auto-vampirism''' is a form of vampirism that refers to drinking one's own [[blood]], typically as a form of sexual gratification. Although closely related to vampirism, the two differ in that vampirism is a sadistic act while auto-vampirism is on the side of masochism. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourguignon|first=A|date=February 1977|title=[Status of vampirism and autovampirism]|url=https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/883741|journal=Annales medico-psychologiques|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|issn=0003-4487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with drinking their own blood, most practitioners of auto-vampirism also engage in [[self-harm]] in order to obtain the blood.&lt;ref&gt;McCully, R. S. (1964). Vampirism: Historical perspective and underlying process in relation to a case of auto-vampirism. ''Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 139,'' 440–451.&lt;/ref&gt;    

V[[Clinical vampirism|ampirism]] also includes any violent or sexual act done to or in the presence of the body of a dead being, not just drinking the blood of a fellow, living human. Auto-vampirism is typically the first stage of [[Clinical vampirism|Clinical Vampirism,]] or more commonly known as Renfield's Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourguignon|first=A|date=1977/02|title=[Status of vampirism and autovampirism]|url=https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/883741|journal=Annales medico-psychologiques|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|issn=0003-4487}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The habit of drinking ones own blood usually begins during childhood, most commonly as a result of a traumatic event that results in a person linking pleasure with violence and more specifically blood. It develops by first scraping or cutting one's own skin to extract and ingest blood, later resulting in learning where and how to cut and open major [[Vein|veins]] and [[Artery|arteries]] for larger amounts of blood&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olry|first=Régis|last2=Haines|first2=Duane E.|date=2011-10|title=Renfield's Syndrome: A Psychiatric Illness Drawn from Bram Stoker'sDracula|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F0964704X.2011.595655|journal=Journal of the History of the Neurosciences|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=368–371|doi=10.1080/0964704x.2011.595655|issn=0964-704X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Sometimes, they will also store their own blood for later consumption or just because they like to look at it. Eventually, auto-vampirism develops into clinical vampirism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218202138/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/vampires/7.html|title=Vampire Killers - murderers who were inspired by a lust for blood - The Crime library|date=2007-12-18|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the child goes through puberty, they begin to link sexuality to the pleasure that is already derived from vampirism. There is also usually a sense that seeing or drinking their blood gives them power or increased health, as in general vampirism. At this point, it is considered fetishistic.

There are cases where vampirism and auto-vampirism are one of many symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. This was illustrated in the case of a 35- year old woman with schizophrenia who experienced severe depersonalization and auditory hallucinations that commanded her to drink her own blood. Auto-vampirism, for her, was part of a delusion about a purification process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Hans Mørch|last2=Poulsen|first2=Henrik Day|date=January 2002|title=Auto-vampirism in schizophrenia|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08039480252803918?src=recsys|journal=Nordic Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=56|issue=1|pages=47–48|doi=10.1080/08039480252803918|issn=0803-9488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auto-vampirism can cause anemia, abdominal pain, nausea, and more. It's difficult to determine all the consequences of auto-vampirism due to the difficulty of finding people who drink their own blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jali|first=H M|date=1989-10|title=Tuberculous Anal Ulcer|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/014107688908201026|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|language=en|volume=82|issue=10|pages=629–630|doi=10.1177/014107688908201026|issn=0141-0768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bangladesh National Nutrition Council was established in 1975 on the orders of the [[President of Bangladesh]]. Since 1998 the council observes National Nutrition Week every year at national, district, and upazila level. The council publishes a journal twice every year called the South Asian Journal of Nutrition. The council also helps plan nutritional nutrient programs for relevant seventeen ministries.&lt;ref name="nnv"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mahmud|first1=Iffat|last2=Mbuya|first2=Nkosinathi|title=Water, Sanitation, Hygiene, and Nutrition in Bangladesh: Can Building Toilets Affect Children's Growth?|date=2015|publisher=World Bank Publications|isbn=9781464806995|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlz1CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Bangladesh+National+Nutrition+Council&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SaoRQ1IYK9&amp;sig=e3lcptxCj6gO99S3LjSU7IEwWIA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKho3S_orYAhUJkeAKHZKmBSgQ6AEIlQEwFw#v=onepage&amp;q=Bangladesh%20National%20Nutrition%20Council&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 with the help of the World Bank it carried out a national nutritional survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Per head daily intake declined by 250 calories in 32 yrs|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news/per-head-daily-intake-declined-by-250-calories-in-32-yrs|accessdate=15 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|date=1 August 1997|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the center==
The CWGL is both an academic center at a major public research university as well as a [[non-governmental organization]] with [[ECOSOC]] Special [[Consultative Status]] at the [[United Nations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esango.un.org/paperless/Web?page=static&amp;content=intro |title=ECOSOC Consultative Status |publisher=Esango.un.org |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esango.un.org/paperless/content/E2009INF4.pdf |title=Etpu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; working on policy and advocacy. CWGL works to develop and facilitate women's leadership worldwide not only for women's human rights, but also for international social justice.

Integrating gender and women's human rights into the work of local, national, regional and international institutions, CWGL's programs inform and mobilize advocates for women's human rights around specific events and build linkages among them to enhance their capacity to influence policy making.&lt;ref name="witness"&gt;{{cite web|last=Intern |first=Hub |url=http://hub.witness.org/en/node/5387 |title=The Hub, Page on Charlotte Bunch and CWGL |publisher=Hub.witness.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Center's programmatic work stems from footholds made at the 1993 Vienna [[World Conference on Human Rights]] and the 1995 Beijing [[Fourth World Conference on Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Source: UN NGLS 06/01/2010 11:47&amp;nbsp;am |url=http://www.awid.org/eng/Issues-and-Analysis/Library/NGLS-Interviews-Radhika-Balakrishnan-Executive-Director-Center-for-Women-s-Global-Leadership |title=CWGL Director Interviewed about Implementation of the Beijing Declaration |publisher=Awid.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210143313/http://www.awid.org/eng/Issues-and-Analysis/Library/NGLS-Interviews-Radhika-Balakrishnan-Executive-Director-Center-for-Women-s-Global-Leadership# |archive-date=2010-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working in collaboration with women leaders and NGOs around the world—whether at UN meetings such as the [[Commission on the Status of Women]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/ |title=Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; international mobilization campaigns, such as the [[16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence]],&lt;ref name="16 Days Campaign Homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgl.rutgers.edu/16days/home.html |title=16 Days Campaign Homepage |publisher=Cwgl.rutgers.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://everyhumanhasrights.org/the-center-for-global-womens-leadership-rutgers-university Every Human Has Rights, CWGL Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208110201/http://everyhumanhasrights.org/the-center-for-global-womens-leadership-rutgers-university |date=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or through global education endeavors—CWGL has helped secure international policy commitments that clearly state "women's rights are human rights".

With these policy benchmarks in place, the Center has turned its energy toward implementation of this concept and holding policy making bodies accountable to their promises to the world's women. Core activities in this program area include UN Monitoring and Advocacy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing15/index.html |title=CSW's 54th Session: Beijing+15 |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cwgl.rutgers.edu/globalcenter/policy/b15/index.html |title=CSW's 54th Session: Beijing+15, CWGL's Participation |publisher=Cwgl.rutgers.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701160615/http://www.cwgl.rutgers.edu/globalcenter/policy/b15/index.html# |archive-date=2010-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the coordination of international mobilization campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/HRW/12591b1bfbce72205743c4c1a8443977.htm |title=AlertNet article about CWGL and Activism against Violence Against Women |publisher=Alertnet.org |date=2006-10-09 |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its new executive director in place, the Center is continuing with programmatic work on ending violence against women, protecting women [[human rights defenders]], and encouraging UN reform with a new body to monitor the realization of women's human rights. Moreover, the Center is expanding into considerations of the application of macroeconomic policies and the relationship between women and development within a human rights framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/radhika-balakrishnan/making-the-international_b_549976.html |title=Article on the IMF and Human Rights by CWGL Executive Director |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2010-04-23 |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgl.rutgers.edu/docman/annual-reports/525-cwgl-annual-report-2011-12/file|title=CWGL 2011-12 Annual Report|date=|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgl.rutgers.edu/resources-139/publications|title=Publications of the Center for Women's Global Leadership|date=2008-10-16|publisher=Cwgl.rutgers.edu|accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At Rutgers University==
In addition to bridging the worlds of academia and activism, CWGL spans two different areas of academia at [[Rutgers University]], and the Center is a unit of International Programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sasip.rutgers.edu/ |title=Office of International Programs at Rutgers |publisher=Sasip.rutgers.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the School of Arts and Sciences. The CWGL has a special position within this department because the other programs of the Office of International Programs are either focused on the [[United Nations]] or broken up into regional studies with regional scopes. Thus, the CWGL plays a unique role by fostering women's leadership globally and having an international scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sasip.rutgers.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=68 |title=Office of International Programs, Center for Women's Global Leadership Page |publisher=Sasip.rutgers.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The CWGL is also a member of the [[Institute for Women's Leadership]] (IWL),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwl.rutgers.edu/ |title=Institute for Women's Leadership Homepage |publisher=Iwl.rutgers.edu |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; a consortium of eight women's programs at Rutgers University created to study and promote how and why women lead, and to develop programs that prepare women of all ages to lead effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwl.rutgers.edu/units_cwgl.html |title=Institute for Women's Leadership, CWGL Member Page |publisher=Iwl.rutgers.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poster collection===

The [http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/foster Margery Somers Foster Center], [http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/ Rutgers University Libraries], in collaboration with the Department of Women's and Gender Studies and the Center for Women's Global Leadership (CWGL), both of the School of Arts and Sciences, have developed the [http://www.cwgl.rutgers.edu/resources-139/cwgls-poster-collection Poster Collection portal], which provides digitized access to approximately 300 posters published by women's rights organizations worldwide and housed at CWGL. The posters chronicle 20 years of transnational women's activism and advocacy, while documenting evolving issues of the global women's movement. The digital repository is housed in [http://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu RUcore, the Rutgers Community Institutional Repository], an online archive, where they are accessible to all. [[The American Library Association (ALA)|The American Library Association]] recognized the CWGL poster collection in 2012, and were awarded the 2012 Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Women and Gender Studies Section (WGSS) Award for Significant Achievement in Woman's Studies Librarianship.&lt;ref name="rutgers2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cwgl.rutgers.edu/resources-139/cwgls-poster-collection|title=ALA Recognition|publisher=cwgl.rutgers.edu|accessdate=2015-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection is also featured on Discovering American Women's History Online.&lt;ref name="mtsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.mtsu.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/women|title=Discovering American Women's History Online|publisher=digital.mtsu.edu|accessdate=2015-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At the United Nations==
At the [[United Nations]], CWGL plays a major role at various meetings addressing the implementation of commitments from world conferences including the [[Vienna Conference (1993)]], [http://www.cwgl.rutgers.edu/publications/coalition-building/156-publications/cb/310-from-vienna-to-beijing-the-cairo-hearing-on-reproductive-health-and-human-rights Cairo Hearing on Reproductive Health and Human Rights], [http://www.cwgl.rutgers.edu/docman/coalition-building-publications/367-copenhagen-hearing-on-economic-justice/file Copenhagen Hearing on Economic Justice and Women's Human Rights], and the [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/ Beijing Conference], particularly at the [[UN Commission on the Status of Women]], the [[UN Human Rights Council]], and at the reviews of these UN World Conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgl.rutgers.edu/events/past-events|title=CWGL Past Events|date=2003-11-17|publisher=Cwgl.rutgers.edu|accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several critical meetings at the [[United Nations]] that serve as important opportunities for women's human rights advocates to assess successes and failures in implementing commitments to women. As an ECOSOC accredited [[NGO]], the CWGL participates directly in roundtables organized by the NGO Committee on the Status of Women in preparation for each session of the [[Commission on the Status of Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/NGO.html |title=NGO Participation in the Commission on the Status of Women |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this capacity, the CWGL plays a multifaceted role by:
*Facilitating planning sessions in which women's human rights defenders and advocates can both monitor and contribute to meetings effectively
*Convening a women's human rights caucus and other gatherings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing15/index.html|title=NGLS Discussion of the Conclusion of the 54th Session of the CSW in March 2010|date=|publisher=Un-ngls.org|accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/conf/seforms/dspUNcalendar2.html |title=Calendar of NGO caucuses at 52nd annual CSW |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cwgl.rutgers.edu/globalcenter/policy/unadvocacy/CSW%2008%20Linkage%20Statement.pdf |title=Statement from the UN 52nd Annual CSW Linkage Caucus |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720040934/http://www.cwgl.rutgers.edu/globalcenter/policy/unadvocacy/CSW%2008%20Linkage%20Statement.pdf# |archive-date=2011-07-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Organizing monitoring and other advocacy training {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
*Sending out alerts and reports both before and after such meetings

In March 2007, the [[Women's Environment &amp; Development Organization]] (WEDO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wedo.org/ |title=WEDO Homepage |publisher=Wedo.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with the Center for Women's Global Leadership, convened a meeting of 50 women activists from around the world to develop a comprehensive and multi-faceted strategy for global, regional and national action to gain the UN General Assembly's approval of a stronger, single, fully resourced women's entity at the UN. As a result of that meeting and the continued need for women's collaborative advocacy on this issue, WEDO and the CWGL, along with hundreds of activists spanning all regions, launched the [[Gender Equality Architecture Reform]] (GEAR) campaign in February 2008, to mobilize women's groups and allies to push for the adoption of the new UN entity for gender equality and women's empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-ngls.org/IMG/pdf_ROUNDUP.2.pdf |title=NGLS March 2010 RoundUp of CSW 54th Session, including interviews with Charlotte Bunch and information about CWGL with regard to the GEAR Campaign |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On June 30, 2010, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution was agreed to and subsequently formally adopted by the General Assembly on Friday, July 2, to establish "[[UN Women]]", the new gender equality entity at the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gearcampaign.org/news_events/uncategorized/un-women-born-civil-society-celebrates-creation-of-gender-equality-entity-after-four-years-of-advocacy/ |title=GEAR Campaign Press Release &amp;#124; UN Women Born! |publisher=Gearcampaign.org |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2010-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801012123/http://www.gearcampaign.org/news_events/uncategorized/un-women-born-civil-society-celebrates-creation-of-gender-equality-entity-after-four-years-of-advocacy/ |archivedate=2012-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for research on Children, Adolescents and the Media (CCAM)''' at the [[University of Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]], was founded in 2005 by [[Patti Valkenburg]]. Since then, it has grown into one of the largest research centers in its kind worldwide.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} CCAM hosts 25 international researchers from 9 academic disciplines. It is part of the [[Amsterdam School of Communication Research]] ASCoR. Since 2009, CCAM researchers have organized an international master program on Youth and Media.

==Focus==

Children and adolescents have become the defining users of [[media (communication)|media]] and technologies. Despite a booming media industry aimed at young people, little is known about the uses and effects of these media and technologies. CCAM strives to better understand the role of media in [[children]]'s and adolescents' lives. What are the intended and unintended effects of [[advertising]]? Which children are particularly susceptible to potential negative effects of advertising, pornography, and media [[violence]]? When do [[social media]] have positive and negative influences on young people? Researchers in CCAM have published dozens of articles and chapters that provide answers on questions like these.

==Open access==

CCAM has an [[open access]] policy. All publications can be downloaded from the publication section. In addition, all instruments that CCAM researchers have created to investigate their theories and models are freely accessible via the website of CCAM.

==Knowledge dissemination==

Research within CCAM is targeted at an academic audience as well as the public at large. Every three months, the center publishes a news bulletin to inform the broader audience of the latest research insights.

The '''chameleon''' is a hypothetical [[scalar particle]] that couples to matter more weakly than gravity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2015/08/tiny-fountain-atoms-sparks-big-insights-dark-energy  Tiny fountain of atoms sparks big insights into dark energy] by Adrian Cho on August 20, 2015. Published at the "American Association for the Advancement of Science"&lt;/ref&gt; postulated as a [[dark energy]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;J Khoury and A. Weltman, Phys. Rev. D '''69''', 044026 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a non-linear self-interaction, it has a variable effective mass which is an increasing function of the ambient energy density—as a result, the range of the force mediated by the particle is predicted to be very small in regions of high density (for example on Earth, where it is less than 1mm) but much larger in low-density intergalactic regions: out in the cosmos chameleon models permit a range of up to several thousand [[parsecs]]. As a result of this variable mass, the hypothetical [[fifth force]] mediated by the chameleon is able to evade current constraints on [[equivalence principle]] violation derived from terrestrial experiments even if it couples to matter with a strength equal or greater than that of gravity. Although this property would allow the chameleon to drive the currently observed acceleration of the [[cosmic inflation|universe's expansion]], it also makes it very difficult to test for experimentally.

==Hypothetical properties==
Chameleon particles were proposed in 2003 by Khoury and Weltman.

In most theories, chameleons have a mass that scales as some power of the local energy density: &lt;math&gt;m_\text{eff} \sim \rho^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha \simeq 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Chameleons also couple to photons, allowing photons and chameleons to oscillate between each other in the presence of an external [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Chameleons can be confined in hollow containers because their mass increases rapidly as they penetrate the container wall, causing them to reflect. One strategy to search experimentally for chameleons is to direct photons into a cavity, confining the chameleons produced, and then to switch off the light source. Chameleons would be indicated by the presence of an afterglow as they decay back into photons.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Steffen et al., "Constraints on chameleons and axion-like particles from the GammeV experiment" [https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5070]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of experiments have attempted to detect chameleons along with [[axions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The GammeV experiment&lt;ref&gt;[http://gammev.fnal.gov/ GammeV experiment at Fermilab]&lt;/ref&gt; is a search for axions, but has been used to look for chameleons too. It consists of a cylindrical chamber inserted in a 5 [[Tesla (unit)|T]] magnetic field. The ends of the chamber are glass windows, allowing light from a laser to enter and afterglow to exit.  GammeV set the limited coupling to photons in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Search for Chameleon Particles Using a Photon-Regeneration Technique|date = 22 Jan 2009|journal =  Physical Review Letters|accessdate = |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.030402|pmid = 19257328|arxiv = 0806.2438 |bibcode = 2009PhRvL.102c0402C |volume=102|issue = 3|pages = 030402|last1 = Chou|first1 = A.

The '''conservation and restoration of archaeological sites''' is the process of professionally protecting an archaeological site from further damage and restore it to a previous state. 
Archaeological sites require an extra level of care in regards to their conservation and restoration. Archaeology, even with through documentation, is a destructive force. This is because once a site has been even partially excavated, it cannot be put back the way it was, so in order to continue getting information from the site, it must be conserved to the current best standards.

==Life of a site==
According to Ashurst and Shalom, archaeological sites have several phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashurst|first1=John|last2=Shalom|first2=Asi|title=Reading 38: Short Story: The Demise, Discovery, Destruction and Salvation of a Ruin (2007) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|page=353-364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Creation of the Site:''' During this phase, the site is in use and has been established.
#'''Deterioration:''' After the site has been abandoned, natural forces take hold of the area and begin to weaken any structures that have been built. Animals also will burrow through the remnants, destroying floors, walls, and moving objects around. As walls and structures fall, they settle in different patterns and wind and water fill in the openings with dirt and dust.
#'''Identification:''' The site might be identified by archaeologists, or it might be identified by locals or other non-professionals. 
#'''Excavation:''' There are many ways that an excavation can take place. One is that locals or other interested people decide that they want to investigate themselves. Whether this is simply for pot hunting (illegal digging and collecting of artifacts) or as more of an actual attempt at amateur excavation, it can easily damage the site and regularly makes interpretation more difficult. Even when excavated by professionals, sometimes improper techniques or documentation can actually lead to further damage. If done properly, archaeological excavations will reveal many aspects, while still protecting others and detailed documentation takes place to allow the site to be virtually reconstructed as best as possible.
#'''Further Deterioration:''' If the site is then left open, there is a renewal of deterioration since areas are now re-exposed to the weather. 
#'''Ignorant Repair:''' There are many instances where people, with good intentions, attempt to conserve and repair a site. However, it results in more damage than assistance. Some ways that this happens is the use of inappropriate materials, inappropriate uses, as well as the lack of understanding of the original condition of the site (example: construction techniques, last used layout, et cetera). 
#'''Correct Conservation:''' In this instance, correct conservation materials and techniques are used in order to preserve the condition the site was found in, and in rare cases rebuild where things have fallen over. The basic goal, however, is simply to preserve how it was found.
#'''Reburial:''' In the case that the site cannot be properly preserved while in the open (due to funding or other reasons), one of the better conservation techniques is simply to rebury the site in order to protect it from further deterioration.&lt;ref name="Reburial"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demas|first1=Martha|title="Site unseen": The Case for Reburial of Archaeological Sites|journal=Conservation and Management of Archaeological Sites|volume=6|issue=3-4|pages=137-154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these phases can be repeated and happen in a variety of orders.

==Dangers==
===Weathering===
The source of most damage is weather. Erosion through wind, rain, freeze-thaw, and evaporation are extremely common and other than covering the site entirely cannot be prevented. However, more dramatic factors are natural disasters: floods, fires, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, et cetera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meier|first1=Hans-Rudolf|last2=Petzet|first2=Michael|last3=Will|first3=Thomas|title=Cultural Heritage and Natural Disasters| date=2008|publisher=TUDpress|location=Germany|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/2007/natural_disasters/HR_Special_2007_Disasters_ebook_20091116.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best way to protect archaeological sites from these larger events is to formulate a [[risk management]] plan. The basics of this are to first identify what threatens the site the most and then determine its susceptibility to it. This plan will be much like that for any structure or area, the only difference is that there are no codes that must be upheld.

An example of how some locations are dealing with this is in Florida, where they have faced many floods as well as soil erosion. A technique they have been putting into effect is easements in order to protect the archaeological sites from this risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation Easements|url=http://dos.myflorida.com/historical/archaeology/cultural-resource-protection/conservation-easements/|website=Florida Division of Historical Resources|publisher=Florida Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Phoenix-Pueblo Grande Ruin-Hohokam Village-2.JPG|thumb|Pueblo Grande Ruin-Hohokam Village. Note the buildings in the background; this is in downtown Phoenix, Arizona.]]
An unfortunate risk to archaeological sites is development itself. As the world continues to develop and build new buildings and roadways, many times archaeological sites are damaged. An example of this is in Arizona. There was an Ancient Puebloan site that dates to A.D. 900-1350 was damaged by construction activities while putting in a new road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeMar|first1=David|title=The Result of a Damage Assessment and Limited Data Recovery Conducted at Site AZ-P-43-22 Located Near Pine Springs Wide Ruins Chapter, Fort Defiance Agency, Apache County, Arizona|date=May 15, 1996|publisher=San Juan County Museum Association|location=Farmington, NM}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the damage was assessed, it was determined that the site is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. However, this determination was made because there is not enough remaining for it to be of any "information important in prehistory or history."

While development cannot be discontinued simply to protect archaeological sites, having a basic understanding of what might be impacted before development takes place could help protect sites and at least the information they can provide. The Arizona Antiquities Act of 1960 is an example of some ways in which archaeological sites can be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haury|first1=Emil|title=The Arizona Antiquities Act of 1960|journal=Kiva|volume=26|issue=1|pages=19-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vandalism===
Vandalism is also a prominent force of damage to archaeological sites. A range of actions can be considered, including graffiti, carving, deconstruction, and burning. These can be intentional or unintentional. Intentional vandalism is when visitors know that there is an archaeological site and yet still chose to harm it in some way. Unintentional vandalism happens when the visitor vandalizes while not realizing they are at an archaeological site.

An example of an unintentional vandalism is if someone is hunting small game and they see several rock around and decide to pile them up into a berm to shoot from behind. Unbeknownst to them, those rocks were not just naturally placed but actually a collapsed wall of an ancient building, with the majority of it underground. An example of intentional vandalism is graffiti. This can be considered intentional even if the visitors are unaware of the location being an archaeological site, because there is purposeful destruction even of a natural location. [[Tumamoc Hill]] in Tucson, Arizona has been subjected to this form of vandalism for centuries. Tumamoc Hill has a site on its top and has rock art all along the sides. It appears as though visitors throughout history have decided to join in on this tradition by adding their own initials and artwork.&lt;ref name="Tumamoc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Gayle|last2=Boyle|first2=Peter|title=New Perspectives on the Rock Art and Prehistoric Settlement Organization of Tumamoc Hill, Tucson, Arizona|date=2013|publisher=Arizona State Museum, The University of Arizona|location=Tucson|isbn=978-1-889747-93-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to protect an archaeological site from vandalism, a combination of techniques needs to be used. The most important is education of the public. This isn't just in terms of explaining that vandalism is bad, but rather to also educate them on the importance of these sites and what can be lost if they do chose to vandalize the site. This can be as easily done as adding signage. Another strategy is to discourage the activity through adding barriers, patrols, or even full-time observation. Another vital way to help is to routinely survey the area in order to track changes. This technique can also assist in terms of weathering damage.&lt;ref name="Tumamoc" /&gt;

===War===
[[File:Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction.jpg|thumb|Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction ]]
Throughout history, war has also caused much destruction of archaeological and historical sites. The Nazis during World War II destroyed many buildings during the [[planned destruction of Warsaw]], including several palaces and other buildings dating back to before the 13th century. In more recent times, the Taliban destroyed the sacred Buddha statue in Afghanistan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rashid|first1=Ahmed|title=After 1,700 Years, Buddhas fall to Taliban dynamite|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1326063/After-1700-years-Buddhas-fall-to-Taliban-dynamite.html|website=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ISIS YouTube videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perez|first1=Chris|title=ISIS ransacks museum, destroys 2,000-year-old artifacts|url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/26/isis-destroys-ancient-iraqi-artifacts/|website=New York Post|publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevention of this is virtually impossible without large-scale efforts such as those done by the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] that has become popularized by the 2014 movie ''[[The Monuments Men]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==People involved==
===Archaeologists===
The goal of archaeologists as well as other archaeological site conservators is "To preserve the physical remains of our past and to employ them in perpetuating our historical heritage."&lt;ref name="Arch" &gt;{{cite book|last1=South|first1=Stanley|title=The Role of the Archaeologist in the Conservation-Preservation Process in "Preservation and Conservation: Principles and Practices"|date=1976|publisher=The Preservation Press|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=35-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way an archaeologist can assist in this is to be as thorough in their documentation as possible. This way, even if the site is physically destroyed, there are existing records of how it once was. It is also important that archaeologists use excavation techniques that impact the site as little as possible and saves features. A current technique used is that the entire site is not actually excavated, only parts that are viewed as being able to answer research questions the best.&lt;ref name="Arch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=John|title=Reading 9: Conservation Manual (1923) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=47-49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A previous technique used was to reconstruct walls and other features of the site in order to make it look more like it did when in use, however that has been mostly going out of style and instead the preservation of how the site was found is growing greater and greater in importance.

===Visitors===
Visitors hold a large responsibility in regards to archaeological site preservation. This goes beyond just vandalism. Even just their presence can be harmful for a site. An example of this happened at [[Recapture Canyon]] in Utah. In 2007, the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had to close access to the canyon to off-road vehicles due to the damage it was causing local archaeological sites.&lt;ref name="BLM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crandall|first1=Megan|title=BLM Statement Regarding Proposed Illegal ATV Ride in Recapture Canyon|url=http://www.blm.gov/ut/st/en/info/newsroom/2014/may/blm_statement_regarding.html|website=BLM}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several visitors did not listen to this and actually created a wider trail through the canyon. Also, in May 2014 a large protest was held. This protest consisted of hundreds of protesters riding off-road vehicles through the canyon itself.&lt;ref name="BLM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuzmanic|first1=Joyce|title=Blanding: OHV riders, militia protest BLM ride through Recapture Canyon|url=http://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2014/05/10/jek-ohv-riders-militia-gather-protest-blm/#.VTFlM5MtwjU|publisher=St. George News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large amount of people going through in such a short amount of time, it is very possible that the protest itself caused further damage.

In order to combat further damage, archaeological sites that are open to the public are given trails that do not actually impact the site while still giving visitors a good view of it. It is important for visitors to understand their own impact on archaeological sites they visit. If there is a designated path, they should remain on it. If they see artifacts, they can point to them and take pictures but not pick them up and move them.

===Conservators===
Conservators are the leaders in going the extra mile for archaeological site conservation. It is these specialists that need to formulate the largest and longest-lasting plan. Martha Demas has created a great outline that conservators can rely on in order to create the most impactful plan.&lt;ref name="Reburial" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Demas|first1=Martha|title=Reading 64: Planning of Conservation and Management of Archaeological Sites: A Values-Based Approach (2000) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=653-675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Identification and description
##Aims: ''What are the aims and expectations of the planning process?''
##Stakeholders: ''Who should be involved in the planning process?''
##Documentation and Description: ''What is known about the site and what needs to be understood?''
#Assessment and Analysis
##Cultural Significance/Values: ''Why is the site important or valued and by whom is it valued?''
##Physical Condition: ''What is the condition of the site or structure; what are the threats?''
## Management Context: ''What are the current constraints and opportunities that will affect the conservation and management of the site?''
#Response
##Establish Purpose and Policies: ''For what purpose is the site being conserved and managed? How are the values of the site going to be preserved?''
##Set Objectives: ''What will be done to translate policies into actions?''
##Develop Strategies: ''How will the objectives be put into practice?''
##Synthesize and Prepare Plan
#Periodic Review and Revision

==Techniques==
The purpose of any technique used on an archaeological site is to strengthen its ability to resist damage and/or reinstate its cultural significance and ability to teach about its history.

===Restoration===
Restoration is the "returning of the existing fabric of a place to a known earlier state by removing accretions or by reassembling existing components without the introduction of new material."&lt;ref name="Rest"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolfitt|first1=Catherine|title=Reading 51: Preventive Conservation of Ruins: Reconstruction, Reburial and Enclosure (2007) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=503-513}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest difficulty in this technique is the lack of introducing new material. Ideally, this is the primary technique to be used in order to strengthen the site from further damage.

===Reconstruction===
[[File:Pucllana Archaeological site - restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Huaca Pucllana]] Reconstruction Effort]]
Reconstruction is "returning a place to a known earlier state; distinguished from restoration by the introduction of new material into the fabric."&lt;ref name="Rest" /&gt; The aim of restoration is to "preserve and reveal the aesthetic and historic value of the monument and is based on respect for original material and authentic documents."&lt;ref name="ICOMOS"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petzet|first1=Michael|title=International Charters for Conservation and Restoration|date=2004|publisher=ICOMOS|location=Germany|edition=2|url=http://openarchive.icomos.org/431/1/Monuments_and_Sites_1_Charters.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also debate on whether this is considered conservation work or not, due to potential miss use of that fact in order to over-reconstruct.&lt;ref name="Rest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rest2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Nicholas|title=Reading 52: The Reconstruction of Ruins: Principles and Practices (2009) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=514-527}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appropriateness of this technique is highly dependent upon the region, the amount of known knowledge of the site itself, as well as the actual condition of the site. The older a site, the more difficult it is to be confident in the reconstruction. Reconstruction should also be identifiable upon inspection as well as reversible.&lt;ref name="Rest2" /&gt; A common form of reconstruction is the re-plastering of floors and walls. Due to weathering, the plaster that originally protected surfaces has eroded away and left the surfaces vulnerable. The re-plastering then adds that layer of protection back and in many cases was at least the same technique as originally even if it isn't exactly the same material.

===Recreation/renovation===
Recreation/renovation is the "speculative creation of a presumed earlier state on the basis of surviving evidence from that place to other sites, and on deductions drawn from that evidence using new materials."&lt;ref name="Rest" /&gt; This is the least favorable option as it is less likely to reinstate the originality of the site and many times includes the destruction of existing authentic materials in order to add new materials. It is deemed justifiable if it is the only form of effective conservation available. 
or if conservation measures prove to be unfeasible.&lt;ref name="ICOMOS" /&gt;

===Relocation===
[[File:Abusimbel.jpg|thumb|Mid-move of the Abu Simbel Temples]]
Relocation is a dramatic form of conservation which involves the physical movement of the site or part of the site itself.&lt;ref name="ICOMOS" /&gt; This should only take place if the site would be heavily damaged or even eliminated if it were to not be moved. A famous example of this is the move of the [[Abu Simbel temples]]. The movement of these temples was expensive as well as challenging, but if the move did not take place they would be completely underwater due to the construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]].

'''Consumer culture theory''' is the study of [[consumption choice]]s and behaviors from a social and cultural point of view, as opposed to an [[Economics|economic]] or [[psychological]] one. It does not offer a grand unifying theory but "refers to a family of theoretical perspectives that address the dynamic relationships between consumer actions, the marketplace, and cultural meanings".&lt;ref name="CCT1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnould|first1=E. J.|last2=Thompson|first2=C. J.|year=2005|title=Consumer culture theory (CCT): Twenty Years of Research|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=31|issue=4|pages=868–882|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/ucpjconrs/v_3a31_3ay_3a2005_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a868-882.htm|doi=10.1086/426626}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflective of a [[Postmodernism|post-modernist]] society, it views cultural meanings as being numerous and fragmented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Firat|first1=A.

Consumer culture is viewed as "social arrangement in which the relations between lived culture and social resources, between meaningful ways of life and the symbolic and material resources on which they depend, are mediated through markets"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnould|first=E.

There is a widely held misperception by people outside CCT researchers that this field is oriented toward the study of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] contexts.&lt;ref name="CCT1" /&gt; Memorable study contexts, such as the [[Harley-Davidson]] subculture&lt;ref name="bikes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schouten|first1=J.|last2=McAlexander|first2=J. H.|year=1995|title=Subcultures of Consumption: An Ethnography of the New Bikers|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=22|issue=3|pages=43–.,./61|url=http://classes.bus.oregonstate.edu/winter-07/ba492/Subcultures%20of%20Consumption.pdf|doi=10.1086/209434}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Burning Man]] festival&lt;ref name="burning"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kozinets|first=Robert V|year=2002|title=Can Consumers Escape the Market? Emancipatory Illuminations from Burning Man|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|publisher=University of Chicago Press|volume=29|issue=1|pages=20–38|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/ucpjconrs/v_3a29_3ay_3a2002_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a20-38.htm|accessdate=7 August 2010|doi=10.1086/339919}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably fueled this perspective, which is far from the theory development aim of this school of thought.

While CCT is often associated with [[qualitative methodology|qualitative methodologies]], such as interviews, case studies, [[Ethnography|ethnographic]], as well as 'netnographic' methods&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Field Behind the Screen: Using Netnography for Marketing Research in Online Communities|url = http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.39.1.61.18935|journal = Journal of Marketing Research|date = February 1, 2002|issn = 0022-2437|pages = 61–72|volume = 39|issue = 1|doi = 10.1509/jmkr.39.1.61.18935|first = Robert V.|last = Kozinets}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are well adapted to study the experiential, sociological and cultural aspects of consumption, these are not a prerequisite to CCT contribution (Arnould &amp; Thompson 2005).

== Fields of study ==
Arnould &amp; Thompson&lt;ref name="CCT1" /&gt; identifies four research programs in CCT: 
*Consumer identity projects, such as Schau &amp; Gilly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schau|first1=H. J.|last2=Gilly|first2=M. C.|year=2003|title=We Are What We Post? Self-Presentation in Personal Web Space|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=30|issue=4|pages=384–404|jstor=3132017|doi=10.1086/378616}}&lt;/ref&gt; study on personal web space, which studied how consumers create a coherent self through marketer-produced materials
*Marketplace culture, such as Schouten &amp; McAlexander&lt;ref name="bikes" /&gt; study on the Harley-Davidson subculture, which looked at consumers as culture producers. This research program builds particularly on Maffesoli's concept of neo-tribes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Time of the Tribes: The Decline of Individualism in Mass Society|url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=36elPGofHRUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=maffesoli+tribes&amp;ots=hV24JGRbE9&amp;sig=oBtoxgJANeqzP2WzuijhDr6y-zY|publisher = SAGE|date = 1995-12-05|isbn = 9781848609532|first = Michel|last = Maffesoli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of consumer tribes have focused, for example, on clubbing culture and surf culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Learning to be tribal: facilitating the formation of consumer tribes|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03090561311306886|journal = European Journal of Marketing|date = May 24, 2013|issn = 0309-0566|pages = 813–832|volume = 47|issue = 5/6|doi = 10.1108/03090561311306886}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Mass-mediated marketplace ideologies and consumers' interpretive strategies, such as Kozinets&lt;ref name="burning" /&gt; study of the Burning Man Festival, which looked at consumer ideologies and identities are influenced by economic and cultural globalisation and how cultural product systems orient consumers toward certain ideologies or identity projects.
*Sociohistoric patterning of consumption, such as Holt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holt|first=D. B.|year=1998|title=Does Cultural Capital Structure American Consumption|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=25|issue=1|pages=1–25|doi=10.1086/209523}}&lt;/ref&gt; study which looked at the influence of social capital on consumption choices.

'''Corymb''' is a [[botany|botanical]] term for an [[inflorescence]] with the [[flower]]s growing in such a fashion that the outermost are born on longer [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]] than the inner, bringing all flowers up to a common level. A cyme has a flattish top superficially resembling an [[umbel]], and may have a branching structure similar to a [[panicle]]. Flowers in a corymb structure can either be parallel, or alternate, and form in either a convex, or flat form.

Many species in the Maloideae, such as hawthorns and rowans, produce their flowers in corymbs. The [[Norway maple]] and [[yerba maté]] are also examples of corymbs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">A '''death in office''' is the death of a person who was [[incumbent]] of an office-position until the time of death. Such deaths have been usually due to natural causes, but they are also caused by [[accident]]s and murders.

The death of most [[monarch]]s and [[pope]]s have been deaths in office, since they have usually held their papacy/reign for the rest of their lives. Otherwise as most office positions require that the person is constantly competent in performing the associated duties, deaths in office are usually premature deaths.

==Consequences==
{{see also|Order of succession|Casual vacancy}}
Systems differ in how they deal with the death of an office holder. In some death results in a [[casual vacancy]], whereby the office is unfilled for a time. The office may subsequently be filled by a [[by-election]] or by appointment. A person may temporarily take the powers and responsibilities of the deceased in an "acting" capacity before a permanent replacement is made. In other systems there may be a legally defined [[order of succession]]. For example, in [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarchies]] reigns are typically expected to end with death and the transition of power to an heir. Many presidential systems have offices of [[Vice president#In government|vice president]], whose principle responsibility is to immediately assume the presidency if the president dies or otherwise leaves the office.

In [[aviation]], '''endurance''' is the maximum length of time that an aircraft can spend in [[Cruise (aeronautics)|cruising flight]].  Endurance is different from [[range (aeronautics)|range]], which is a measure of distance flown. For example, a typical [[sailplane]] exhibits high endurance characteristics but poor range characteristics.

Endurance can be defined as:

&lt;math&gt;E=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}dt=-\int_{W_1}^{W_2}\frac{dW}{F}=\int_{W_2}^{W_1}\frac{dW}{F}&lt;/math&gt;

where W stands for fuel weight, F for fuel flow, and t for time.

Endurance can factor into aviation design in a number of ways. Some aircraft, such as the [[P-3 Orion]] or [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane, require high endurance characteristics as part of their mission profile (often referred to as '''[[Loiter (aeronautics)|loiter]] time (on target)'''). Endurance plays a prime factor in finding out the [[fuel fraction]] for an aircraft.
Endurance, like range, is also related to fuel efficiency; fuel-efficient aircraft will tend to exhibit good endurance characteristics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24204">'''Extra-pair copulation''' ('''EPC''') is a [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]] [[mating]] behaviour in [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous]] species. Monogamy occurs when an individual has only one sexual partner at any one time, forming a long term bond and combining efforts to raise offspring together; extra-pair copulation occurs when one of these individuals mates outside of this pairing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrie|first=Marion|last2=Kempenaers|first2=Bart|date=1998-02-01|title=Extra-pair paternity in birds: explaining variation between species and populations|url=http://www.cell.com/article/S0169534797012329/abstract|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=English|volume=13|issue=2|pages=52–58|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01232-9|issn=0169-5347|pmid=21238200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the animal kingdom, extra-pair copulation is common in [[monogamous]] species, and only a very few [[Pair bond|pair-bonded]] species are thought to be exclusively sexually [[monogamous]]. EPC in the animal kingdom has mostly been studied in birds and mammals.&lt;ref name="Houtman, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gowaty and Bridges 1991a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bollinger and gavin, 1991" /&gt; Possible benefits of EPC can be investigated within non-human species, such as birds.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007" /&gt; In males, a number of theories are proposed to explain extra-pair copulations. One such hypothesis is that males maximise their [[reproductive success]] by copulating with as many females as possible outside of a pair bond relationship because their [[parental investment]] is lower, meaning they can copulate and leave the female with minimum risk to themselves. Females, on the other hand, have to invest a lot more in their offspring; extra-pair copulations produce a greater cost because they put the resources that their mate can offer at risk by copulating outside the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite this, females do seek out extra pair copulations,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forstmeier|first=Wolfgang|last2=Martin|first2=Katrin|last3=Bolund|first3=Elisabeth|last4=Schielzeth|first4=Holger|last5=Kempenaers|first5=Bart|date=2011-06-28|title=Female extrapair mating behavior can evolve via indirect selection on males|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/26/10608|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=108|issue=26|pages=10608–10613|doi=10.1073/pnas.1103195108|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3127899|pmid=21670288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, because of the risk, there is more debate about the evolutionary benefits for females.

==In men==
Extra-pair copulation in men has been explained as being partly due to parental investment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buss|first1=David M|title=Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures.|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=1989|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–49|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00023992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has suggested&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; that copulation poses more of a risk to future investment for women, as they have the potential of becoming pregnant, and consequently require a large parental investment of the [[gestation period]], and then further rearing of the offspring. Contrastingly, men are able to copulate and then abandon their mate as there is no risk of pregnancy for themselves, meaning there is a smaller risk of parental investment in any possible offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Trivers |first1=Robert |title=Parental investment and sexual selection |date=1996 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-35456-3 |pages=795–838 |url=http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy2664/Documents/trivers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Trivers |first1=Robert |title=Parental investment and sexual selection |date=1996 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-35456-3 |pages=795–838 |url=http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy2664/Documents/trivers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to having such low parental investment, it is evolutionarily adaptive for men to copulate with as many women as possible, as it will allow them to spread their genes with little risk of future investment. This may therefore lead to more extra-pair copulation in men, as they are able to copulate with other women without the consequences of having to rear new offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gangestad |first1=Steven |last2=Simpson |first2=Jeffry |title=The evolution of human mating: Trade-offs and strategic pluralism |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=2000 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=573–644 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0000337X |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=65461&amp;fileId=S0140525X0000337X |pmid=11301543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various factors can increase the probability of EPC in males. Firstly, males with low levels of [[fluctuating asymmetry]] are more likely to have EPCs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad|first1=Steven W|last2=Thornhill|first2=Randy|title=The evolutionary psychology of extrapair sex: The role of fluctuating asymmetry|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=1997|volume=18|issue=2|pages=69–88|doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(97)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to the fact that signals of low fluctuating asymmetry suggest that the males have "good genes", making females more likely to copulate with them as it will enhance the genes of their offspring, even if they do not expect long term commitment from the male.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Psychosocial stress early on in life, including behaviours such as physical violence and substance abuse, can predict EPC in later life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koehler|first1=Nicole|last2=Chisholm|first2=James S|title=Early Psychosocial Stress Predicts Extra-pair Copulations|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|date=2007|volume=5|issue=1|pages=184–201|doi=10.1177/147470490700500111}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been explained as being due to Life History Theory, which argues that individuals who are reared in environments, where resources are scarce and life expectancy is low, are more likely to engage in reproductive behaviours earlier in life in order to ensure the proliferation of their genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Hillard S|last2=Gangestad|first2=Steven W|title=Life History Theory and Evolutionary Psychology.|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc (Hoboken, NJ, US)|isbn=0471264032|pages=68–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals reared in these environments are said to have short life histories. With respect to Life History Theory, these finding have been explained by suggesting that males who experienced psychosocial stress early in life have short life histories, making them more likely to try and reproduce as much as possible by engaging in EPC to avoid gene extinction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

However, men may also choose not to have EPCs for multiple reasons. One reason may be that long-term monogamous relationships can help form environments that will aid the successful rearing of offspring, as the male is present to help raise them, leading to an increased probability of the male's genes surviving to the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mellen|first1=Sydney|title=The Evolution of Love|date=1981|publisher=Oxford: WH Freeman|isbn=0716712717|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second reason that EPCs may be avoided by a male is that it can be costly to them; their EPC may be discovered, leading to the dissolution of the long-term relationship with their partner and, in some cases, lead to their partner assaulting or even killing them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Men may also avoid EPCs to minimize the risk of putting themselves at increased opportunity for STD transmission which can be common in EPCs. The partners in the EPC may be promiscuous as well leading to a higher statistical chance and probability of contracting venereal diseases; this would counter the lower incidence of STD transmission among exclusively monogamous sexually active couples. Spousal homicide is more likely to be committed by males rather than females, which may make the ramifications of EPC more relevant to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Martin|last2=Wilson|first2=Margo|title=Homicide|date=1988|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter (Hawthorne, NY, US)|isbn=0202011771|pages=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In women==
From an evolutionary perspective, females have to invest a lot more in their offspring than males due to prolonged pregnancy and child rearing, and a child has a better chance of survival and development with two parents involved in child-rearing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morell|first=Virginia|date=1998-09-25|title=A New Look at Monogamy|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/281/5385/1982|journal=Science|language=en|volume=281|issue=5385|pages=1982–1983|doi=10.1126/science.281.5385.1982|issn=0036-8075|pmid=9767050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, extra-pair copulations have a greater cost for women because they put the support and resources that their mate can offer at risk by copulating outside the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also the increased risk of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is suggested as a possible evolutionary reason for the transition from polygamous to monogamous relationships in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauch|first=Chris T.|last2=McElreath|first2=Richard|date=2016-04-12|title=Disease dynamics and costly punishment can foster socially imposed monogamy|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160412/ncomms11219/full/ncomms11219.html|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=7|pages=11219|doi=10.1038/ncomms11219|pmid=27044573|pmc=4832056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, females do seek out extra-pair copulation, with some research finding that women's levels of [[infidelity]] are equal to that of men's, although this evidence is mixed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David M.|last2=Shackelford|first2=Todd K.|date=1997-06-01|title=Susceptibility to Infidelity in the First Year of Marriage|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656697921759|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=31|issue=2|pages=193–221|doi=10.1006/jrpe.1997.2175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the increased risk, there is more confusion about the evolutionary benefits of extra-pair copulation for females.

The most common theory is that women mate outside of the monogamous relationship to acquire better genetic material for their offspring. A female in a relationship with a male with 'poorer genetic quality' may try to enhance the fitness of her children and therefore the continuation of her own genes by engaging in extra-pair copulation with better quality males.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A second theory is that a woman will engage in extra-pair copulation to seek additional resources for herself or her offspring.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is based on observations from the animal world in which females may copulate outside of their pair-bond relationship with neighbours to gain extra protection, food or nesting materials. Finally, [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] have theorized that extra-pair copulation is an indirect result of [[Natural selection|selection]] on males. The [[allele]]s in males that promote extra-pair copulation as an evolutionary strategy to increase [[reproductive success]] is shared between sexes leading to this behaviour being expressed in females.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are also social factors involved in extra-pair copulation. Both males and females have been found to engage in more sexual behaviour outside of the monogamous relationship when experiencing sexual dissatisfaction in the relationship,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; although how this links to evolutionary theory is unclear. Surveys have found cultural differences in attitudes towards infidelity, though it is relatively consistent that female attitudes are less favorable toward infidelity than male attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CHRISTENSEN|first=HAROLD T.|date=1973-01-01|title=Attitudes Toward Marital Infidelity: A Nine-Culture Sampling of University Student Opinion|jstor=41600842|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|volume=4|issue=2|pages=197–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When EPC occurs in animals which show sustained female-male social bonding, this can lead to extra-pair paternity (EPP), in which the female reproduces with an extra-pair male, and hence produces EPO (extra-pair offspring).&lt;ref name="Gowaty chapter"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gowaty |first1=P.A. |editor1-last=Lucas |editor1-first=Jeffrey |editor2-last=Simmons |editor2-first=Leigh |title=Essays in animal behaviour: Celebrating 50 years of animal behaviour |date=2006 |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Burlington, MA |isbn=0-12-369499-X |pages=221–254 |chapter=Beyond extra-pair paternity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the obvious reproductive success benefits for males,&lt;ref name="Gowaty chapter" /&gt; it used to be thought that males exclusively controlled EPCs.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007" /&gt;  However, it is now known that females also seek EPC in some situations.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akçay|first1=E.|last2=Roughgarden|first2=J.|title=Extra-pair paternity in birds: Review of the genetic benefits|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|date=2007|volume=9|issue=5|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/biology_papers/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===
[[File:Taeniopygia guttata -Bird Kingdom, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada -pair-8a.jpg|thumb|Pair of zebra-finches: Bird Kingdom, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada.]]

In [[Polygyny in animals|socially polygynous]] birds, EPP is only half as common as in [[Monogamy#Varieties in biology|socially monogamous]] birds. Some [[Ethology|ethologists]] consider this finding to be support for the 'female choice' hypothesis of mating systems in birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hasselquist|first1=D.|last2=Sherman|first2=P.|title=Social mating systems and extrapair fertilizations in passerine birds|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=2001|volume=12|issue=4|pages=457–466|doi=10.1093/beheco/12.4.457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In mammals===
[[File:Hylobates lar pair of white and black 02.jpg|thumb|left|Pair of white-handed gibbons]]
Additionally, EPC has been shown in [[monogamous]] [[mammals]], such as the [[white-handed gibbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palombit |first1=Ryne A. |title=Extra-pair copulations in a monogamous ape |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=1994 |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=721–723 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1097|url=http://rci.rutgers.edu/~palombit/Palombit_1994b.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of one group found 88% in-pair copulation and 12% extra-pair copulation.&lt;ref name="Reichard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reichard |first1=U. |title=Extra-pair Copulations in a Monogamous Gibbon (Hylobates lar) |journal=Ethology |date=1995 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=99–112 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1995.tb00319.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is much variability in rates of EPP in mammals.&lt;ref name="Cohas and Allaine 2009" /&gt; One study found that this disparity in EPP is better predicted by the differing social structures of different mammals, rather than differing types of pair bonding. For example, EPP was lower in species who live in pairs compared to those who live in solitary or family structures.&lt;ref name="Cohas and Allaine 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohas|first1=A.|last2=Allaine|first2=D.|title=Social structure influences extra-pair paternity in socially monogamous mammals|journal=Biology Letters|date=2009-03-04|volume=5|issue=3|pages=313–316|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2008.0760|pmid=19324647|pmc=2679913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for evolution===
Some argue that EPC is one way in which [[sexual selection]] is operating for [[genetics|genetic]] benefits which is why the extra-pair males involved in EPC seem to be a non-random subset.&lt;ref name="Houtman, 1992" /&gt; There is some evidence for this in birds.&lt;ref name="gray, 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=E.M.|title=Do female red-winged blackbirds benefit genetically from seeking extra-pair copulations?|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1997|volume=53|issue=3|pages=605–623|doi=10.1006/anbe.1996.0337}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[swallows]], males with longer tails are involved in EPC more than those with shorter tails.&lt;ref name="Moller, 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Møller|first1=A.P.|title=Female choice selects for male sexual tail ornaments in the monogamous swallow|journal=Nature|date=1988-04-14|volume=332|issue=6165|pages=640–642|doi=10.1038/332640a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also female swallows with a shorter-tailed within-pair mates are more likely to conduct EPC than those whose mates have longer tails.&lt;ref name="Moller, 1988" /&gt; A similar pattern has been found for [[black-capped chickadees]], in which all extra-pair males had higher rank than the within-pair males.&lt;ref name="smith, 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=S.M.|title=Extra-Pair Copulations in Black-Capped Chickadees: the Role of the Female|journal=Behaviour|date=1988-01-01|volume=107|issue=1|pages=15–23|doi=10.1163/156853988X00160}}&lt;/ref&gt; But some argue that genetic benefits for offspring is not the reason females participate in EPC.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] of genetic benefits of EPC in 55 bird species found that extra-pair offspring were not more likely to survive than within-pair offspring. Also, extra-pair males did not show significantly better ‘good-genes’ traits than within-pair males, except for being slightly larger overall.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007" /&gt;

Another potential explanation for the occurrence of EPC in organisms where females solicit EPC is that the alleles controlling such behaviour are intersexually pleiotropic. Under the hypothesis of intersexual antagonistic pleiotropy, the benefit males get from EPC cancels out the negative effects of EPC for females. Thus, the allele that controls EPC in both organisms would persist, even if it would be detrimental to the fitness of females. Similarly, according to the hypothesis of intrasexual antagonistic pleiotropy, the allele that controls EPC in females also controls a behaviour that is under positive selection, such as receptiveness towards within-pair copulation.&lt;ref name="ForstmeierNakagawa2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forstmeier|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Nakagawa|first2=Shinichi|last3=Griffith|first3=Simon C.|last4=Kempenaers|first4=Bart|title=Female extra-pair mating: adaptation or genetic constraint?|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=29|issue=8|year=2014|pages=456–464|issn=01695347|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2014.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26887">'''Fungiculture''' is the process of producing food, [[medicinal mushrooms|medicine]], and other products by the cultivation of [[mushrooms]] and other [[fungi]]. A ''mushroom farm'' is in the business of growing fungi.

The word is also commonly used to refer to the practice of cultivating fungi by [[leafcutter ant]]s, [[termite]]s, [[ambrosia beetle]]s, and [[Littoraria irrorata|marsh periwinkle]]s.

== Introduction ==
[[Mushroom]]s are not [[plant]]s, and require different conditions for optimal growth. Plants develop through [[photosynthesis]], a process that converts atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] into [[carbohydrate]]s, especially [[cellulose]]. While [[sunlight]] provides an [[energy]] source for plants, mushrooms derive all of their energy and growth materials from their growth medium, through biochemical [[decomposition]] processes. This does not mean that [[light]] is an irrelevant requirement, since some fungi use light as a signal for fruiting.&lt;ref name="r10"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all the materials for growth must already be present in the growth medium. Mushrooms grow well at relative [[humidity]] levels of around 95–100%, and [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] moisture levels of 50 to 75%.&lt;ref name = "r10" /&gt;

Instead of [[seed]]s, mushrooms reproduce asexually through [[spore]]s. Spores can be contaminated with airborne [[microorganism]]s, which will interfere with mushroom growth and prevent a healthy crop.

[[Mycelium]], or actively growing mushroom culture, is placed on a substrate—usually sterilized grains such as rye or millet—and induced to grow into those grains. This is called inoculation. Inoculated grains are referred to as spawn. Spores are another inoculation option, but are less developed than established mycelium. Since they are also contaminated easily, they are only manipulated in laboratory conditions with a [[laminar flow cabinet]].

== Techniques ==
All mushroom growing techniques require the correct combination of humidity, temperature, substrate (growth medium) and inoculum (spawn or starter culture). Wild harvests, outdoor log inoculation and indoor trays all provide these elements.

=== Outdoor logs ===
[[File:Cultivo tradicional de shiitake en Pradejón.jpg|thumb|right|Cultivated shiitake mushrooms]]
Mushrooms can be grown on logs placed outdoors in stacks or piles, as has been done for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="r18"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Sterilization is not performed in this method. Since production may be unpredictable and seasonal, less than 5% of commercially sold mushrooms are produced this way.&lt;ref name="r19"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Here, tree logs are inoculated with spawn, then allowed to grow as they would in wild conditions. Fruiting, or pinning, is triggered by seasonal changes, or by briefly soaking the logs in cool water.&lt;ref name="r18"/&gt; [[Shiitake]] and [[oyster mushroom]]s have traditionally been produced using the outdoor log technique, although controlled techniques such as indoor tray growing or artificial logs made of compressed substrate have been substituted.&lt;ref name="r19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r20"&gt;

Shiitake mushrooms grown under a forested canopy are considered non-timber forest products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mudge|first=Kenneth|title=Forest Farming|journal=The Magazine of the Arnold Arboretum|volume=67|pages=26–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Northeast{{where|date=August 2017}} shiitake mushrooms can be cultivated on a variety of hardwood logs including oak, American beech, sugar maple and hophornbeam. Softwood should not be used to cultivate shiitake mushrooms.&lt;ref name="Cornell Cooperative Extension"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Shiitake Mushroom Cultivation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resin of softwoods will oftentimes inhibit the growth of the shiitake mushroom making it impractical as a growing substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruhn|first=J.N.|author2=Mihail J.D.|title=Forest farming of shiitake mushrooms: Aspects of forced fruiting|journal=Bioresource Technology|year=2009|volume=100|issue=23|pages=5973–5978|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2009.01.079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to produce shiitake mushrooms, 1 metre (3 foot) hardwood logs with a diameter ranging between {{convert|10|-|15|cm|abbr=on|0}} are inoculated with the mycelium of the shiitake fungus. Inoculation is completed by drilling holes in hardwood logs, filling the holes with cultured shiitake mycelium or inoculum, and then sealing the filled holes with hot wax. After inoculation, the logs are placed under the closed canopy of a coniferous stand and are left to incubate for 12 to 15 months. Once incubation is complete, the logs are soaked in water for 24 hours. 7 to 10 days after soaking, shiitake mushrooms will begin to fruit and can be harvested once fully ripe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leatham|first=G.F.|title=Cultivation of shiitake, the japanese forest mushroom, on logs: A potential industry for the united states|journal=Forest Products Laboratory|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indoor trays ===
Indoor growing provides the ability to tightly regulate light, temperature and humidity while excluding contaminants and pests. This allows consistent production, regulated by spawning cycles.&lt;ref name="r2"/&gt;  This is typically accomplished in windowless, purpose-built buildings, for large scale commercial production.

Indoor tray growing is the most common commercial technique, followed by containerized growing. The tray technique provides the advantages of scalability and easier harvesting. Unlike wild harvests, indoor techniques provide tight control over growing substrate composition and growing conditions. Indoor harvests are much more predictable.

According to [[Daniel Royse]] and [[Robert Beelman]], "[Indoor] Mushroom farming consists of six steps, and although the divisions are somewhat arbitrary, these steps identify what is needed to form a production system. The six steps are phase I composting, phase II fertilizing, spawning, casing, pinning, and cropping."&lt;ref name="r5"&gt;

Complete sterilization is not always required or performed during composting. In some cases, a pasteurization step is not included to allow some beneficial microorganisms to remain in the growth substrate.&lt;ref name="r5" /&gt;

Specific time spans and temperatures required during stages 3–6 will vary respective to species and variety. Substrate composition and the geometry of growth substrate will also affect the ideal times and temperatures.

Pinning is the trickiest part for a mushroom grower, since a combination of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) concentration, temperature, light, and humidity triggers mushrooms towards fruiting.&lt;ref name = "r10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r5" /&gt; Up until the point when [[mycelial cord|rhizomorph]]s or mushroom "pins" appear, the mycelium is an amorphous mass spread throughout the growth substrate, unrecognizable as a mushroom.

Carbon dioxide concentration becomes elevated during the vegetative growth phase, when mycelium is sealed in a gas-resistant plastic barrier or bag which traps gases produced by the growing mycelium. To induce pinning, this barrier is opened or ruptured. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration then decreases from about 0.08% to 0.04%, the ambient [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric level]].&lt;ref name="r5"/&gt;

== Substrates ==
Mushroom production converts the raw natural ingredients into mushroom tissue, most notably the carbohydrate [[chitin]].&lt;ref name = "r10" /&gt;

An ideal substrate will contain enough [[nitrogen]] and [[carbohydrate]] for rapid mushroom growth. Common bulk substrates include several of the following ingredients:&lt;ref name = "r2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;

Mushrooms metabolize complex [[carbohydrates]] in their substrate into [[glucose]], which is then transported through the mycelium as needed for growth and energy. While it is used as a main energy source, its concentration in the growth medium should not exceed 2%. For ideal fruiting, closer to 1% is ideal.&lt;ref name = "r10" /&gt;

=== Coffee grounds ===
One of the most sustainable ways of mushroom cultivation is using coffee grounds as a substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mushroom-cultivation.com/|title=Mushroom-cultivation|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was pioneered by Prof. Chang Shuting &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mushroominfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Chang-Bio-FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1990s while he worked at the Chinese University in Hong Kong. Coffee ground are sterile, and rich in fibers. It is more environmentally-friendly; as an estimated millions of kilos of coffee waste disposed in landfill every day, which could be diverted into [[sustainable]] food production. The spent substrate, after harvesting mushrooms, is enriched in essential amino-acids, and therefore an ideal feed for animals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sistemekofungi.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pests and diseases ==

Parasitic insects, bacteria and other fungi all pose risks to indoor production. The [[sciarid fly]] or [[phorid fly]] may lay eggs in the growth medium, which hatch into [[maggots]] and damage developing mushrooms during all growth stages. Bacterial blotch caused by ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' bacteria or patches of ''[[Trichoderma]]'' green mold also pose a risk during the fruiting stage. Pesticides and sanitizing agents are available to use against these infestations.&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;

[[File:Shiitake growing s.jpg|thumb|right|Home cultivated ''[[shiitake]]'' developing over approximately 24 hours.]]

* ''[[Agaricus bisporus]]'', also known as champignon and the button mushroom. This species also includes the portobello and crimini mushrooms.
*''[[Clitocybe nuda]]'', or blewit, is cultivated in Europe.
* ''[[Cloud ear fungus|Auricularia polytricha]]'' or ''[[Auricularia auricula-judae]]'' (Tree ear fungus), two closely related species of [[jelly fungi]] that are commonly used in [[Chinese cuisine]].

* ''[[Enokitake|Flammulina velutipes]]'', the "winter mushroom", also known as ''enokitake'' in Japan
* ''[[Shimeji|Hypsizygus tessulatus]]'' (also ''Hypsizygus marmoreus''), called ''shimeji'' in Japanese, it is a common variety of mushroom available in most markets in Japan. Known as "Beech mushroom" in Europe.
* ''[[Lentinus edodes]]'', also known as [[shiitake]], [[oak]] mushroom. ''Lentinus edodes'' is largely produced in [[Japan]], [[China]] and [[South Korea]]. ''Lentinus edodes'' accounts for 10% of world production of cultivated mushrooms. Common in Japan, China, Australia and North America.
* ''[[Pleurotus]]'' species are the second most important mushrooms in production in the world, accounting for 25% of total world production. ''Pleurotus'' mushrooms are cultivated worldwide; China is the major producer. Several species can be grown on carbonaceous matter such as straw or newspaper. In the wild they are usually found growing on wood.
** ''[[Pleurotus citrinopileatus]]'' (golden oyster mushroom)
** ''[[Pleurotus cornucopiae]]'' (branched oyster mushroom)
** ''[[Pleurotus eryngii]]'' (king trumpet mushroom)

== Production in Europe ==
The oyster mushroom cultivation lately is taking off in Europe. Many entrepreneurs nowadays find it as a quite profitable business, a start-up with a small investment and good profit. Italy with 785,000 tonnes and Netherlands with 307,000 tonnes are between the top ten mushroom producing countries in the world. The world’s biggest producer of mushroom spawn&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sylvaninc.com/|title=Sylvan Inc. - World's Largest Mushroom Spawn Producer - Spawn|website=www.sylvaninc.com|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also situated in France.

According to a research carried out on Production and Marketing of Mushrooms: Global and National Scenario&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wakchaure|first=G C|date=2011-02-01|title=Production and Marketing of Mushrooms: Global and National Scenario|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235951347_Production_and_Marketing_of_Mushrooms_Global_and_National_Scenario|journal=ResearchGate|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.5012.3682}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poland]], [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Lithuania]] are the major exporting mushrooms countries in [[Europe]] and countries like [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Russia]] are considered to be the major importing countries.

== Education and training ==
[[Pleurotus|Oyster mushroom]] cultivation is a sustainable business where different natural resources can be used as a substrate. The number of people becoming interested in this field is rapidly increasing. The possibility of creating a viable business in urban environments by using coffee grounds is appealing for many entrepreneurs.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Since mushroom cultivation is not a subject available at school, most urban farmers learned it by doing. The time to master mushroom cultivation is time consuming and costly in missed revenue. For this reason there are numerous companies in Europe specialized in mushroom cultivation that are offering training for entrepreneurs and organizing events to build community and share knowledge. They also show the potential positive impact of this business on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rotterzwam.com/|title=RotterZwam|website=www.rotterzwam.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.permafungi.be/|title=PermaFungi {{!}} Eat – Grow – Learn|website=www.permafungi.be|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courses about mushroom cultivation can be attended in many countries around Europe. There is education available for growing mushrooms on coffee grounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mushroom-cultivation.com/mushroom-master-program/|title=Mushroom Master Program — Mushroom-cultivation|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.growmushroomsoncoffee.com/|title=Grow Mushrooms on Coffee {{!}} Learn How To Grow Mushrooms On Coffee|website=www.growmushroomsoncoffee.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; more advanced training for larger scale farming,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ekofungischool.com/|title=Ekofungi School - The smart start to your sustainable mushroom business|website=www.ekofungischool.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; spawn production and lab work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mycelia.be/en/mycelia-school|title=Mycelia - Cleanroom technology training -  Mycelia BVBA|website=www.mycelia.be|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and growing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hongosbiofactory.com/training|title=Cursos cultivo de hongos o setas.

'''Gustav Bergmann''' (May 4, 1906&amp;nbsp;– April 21, 1987) was an Austrian-born American philosopher. He studied at the [[University of Vienna]] and was a member of the [[Vienna Circle]]. Bergmann was influenced by the philosophers [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] who were members of the Circle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://clas.uiowa.edu/philosophy/resources/gustav-bergmann "Gustav Bergmann" (clas.uiowa.edu)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], he was a professor of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] at the [[University of Iowa]].

== Biography ==
Bergmann was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. He earned his Ph.D. in mathematics at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1928. His dissertation, directed by [[Walther Mayer]], was titled ''Zwei Beiträge zur mehrdimensionalen Differentialgeometrie''. While studying for his [[doctorate]], he was invited to join the [[Vienna Circle]], a group of philosophers, mathematicians, scientists, and others committed to a scientific worldview under the name of [[logical positivism]]. In 1930–31, he worked with [[Albert Einstein]] in Berlin. Unable as a Jew to find academic employment, Bergmann obtained a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from the University of Vienna in 1935, and practiced [[corporate law]] until he and his family fled to the United States in 1938. Settling at the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City]] in 1939, Bergmann eventually became professor of both philosophy and psychology.

He died in Iowa City.

'''Human Rights and Climate Change''' is a conceptual and legal framework under which international [[human rights]] and their relationship to [[global warming]] are studied, analyzed, and addressed. The framework has been employed by governments, [[United Nations]] organizations, [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] and [[non-governmental organizations]], human rights and environmental advocates, and academics to guide national and international policy on climate change under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and the core [[international human rights instruments]].
	
	Human rights and climate change analysis focuses on the anticipated consequences to humans associated with global environmental phenomena including [[sea level rise]], [[desertification]], temperature increases, extreme weather events, and changes in precipitation, as well as [[climate change adaptation|adaptation]] and [[climate change mitigation|mitigation]] measures taken by governments in response to those phenomena that may involve human rights or related legal protections.

==History==
In 2005, Inuit activist [[Sheila Watt-Cloutier]] filed a petition to the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] seeking relief "from human rights violations resulting from the impacts of global warming and climate change caused by acts and omissions of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Petition to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights Seeking Relief from Violations Resulting from Global Warming Caused by Acts and Omissions of the United States|date=7 December 2005|url=http://www.inuitcircumpolar.com/files/uploads/icc-files/FINALPetitionICC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was rejected, but the Commission invited and heard testimony on the relationship between human rights and climate change from representatives for the Inuit in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sieg|first=Richard|title=At International Commission, Inuit Want to See Change in U.S. Policy on Global Warming|url=http://www.vjel.org/news/NEWS100058.html|accessdate=25 April 2012|date=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, the Malé Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global Climate Change "stated explicitly (and for the first time in an international agreement) that 'climate change has clear and immediate implications for the full enjoyment of human rights' and called on the United Nations human rights system to address the issue as a matter of urgency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Limon|first=Marc|title=HUMAN RIGHTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE: CONSTRUCTING A CASE FOR POLITICAL ACTION|journal=Harvard Environmental Law Review|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=439–476|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/elr/vol33_2/Limon.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Malé Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global Climate Change|date=14 November 2007|url=http://www.ciel.org/Publications/Male_Declaration_Nov07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council#Climate change|UN Human Rights Council]] (HRC) unanimously adopted Resolution 7/23, recognizing that "climate change poses an immediate and far-reaching threat to people and communities around the world and has implications for the full enjoyment of human rights," and citing the [[Charter of the United Nations]], the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 7/23, Human rights and climate change|date=28 March 2008|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_7_23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HRC reaffirmed and expanded these statements with resolutions 10/4 of 25 March 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 10/4, Human rights and climate change|date=25 March 2009|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_10_4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 18/22 of 30 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=A/HRC/RES/18/22 Human rights and climate change|date=30 September 2011|url=http://daccess-ods.un.org/TMP/6246410.01224518.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) released an analytical study identifying specific rights and people groups likely to be adversely affected by climate disruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=OHCHR|title=Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights|date=15 January 2009|issue=A/HRC/10/61|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/103/44/PDF/G0910344.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report drew on the submissions of some 30 nations as well as ten [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|United Nations Agencies]] and dozens of other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=OHCHR|title=OHCHR study on the relationship between climate change and human rights: Submissions and reference documents received|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/HRAndClimateChange/Pages/Submissions.aspx|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report identified displaced persons, conflict and security risks as well as impaired rights of indigenous peoples, women, and children as major concerns.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite journal|title=Report|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/103/44/PDF/G0910344.pdf?OpenElement}}, n.8, at 15-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I, Annex II countries and developing countries|Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC]] reproduced the HRC's language identifying the relationship between human rights and climate change in its report on the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Cancun]], Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conference of the Parties|title=FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, Report of the Conference of the Parties on its sixteenth session, held in Cancun from 29 November to 10 December 2010, Addendum, Part Two: Action taken by the Conference of the Parties at its sixteenth session|date=15 March 2011|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report on the outcome of the Conference emphasized that "Parties should, in all climate change related actions, fully respect human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Id.''|journal=Decision 1/CP.16, The Cancun Agreements:  Outcome of the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention|date=15 March 2011|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent years have seen an increased recognition of the link between human rights and the environment, yet there are still many questions surrounding the relationship between them. As a result, in 2012 the HRC established a mandate on human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 19/10, Human rights and the environment|date=19 April 2012|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/G12/131/59/PDF/G1213159.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary report by the appointed Independent Expert, John H. Knox, further stated that there needed to be priority in providing greater conceptual clarity to the application of human rights obligations related to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment|date=24 December 2012|issue=A/HRC/22/43|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A-HRC-22-43_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, all 78 of the United Nations Special Procedures Mandate Holders issued a joint statement on [[Human Rights Day]] calling for states to incorporate their existing obligations under the human rights framework into climate change negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15393&amp;|title=OHCHR {{!}} Statement of the United Nations Special Procedures Mandate Holders on the occasion of the Human Rights Day Geneva, 10 December 2014|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have the effect of bringing the rights of those affected by climate change to the forefront of all response strategies. 

As of March 2015, there is now a [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on human rights and the environment, an extension of the mandate of the former Independent Expert on human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 28/11, Human rights and the environment|date=7 April 2015|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G15/071/78/PDF/G1507178.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading up to the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris, the Special Rapporteur informed states that they should ensure their human rights obligations encompass the appropriate perspective towards climate change when negotiating future agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16836&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR {{!}} COP21: "States’ human rights obligations encompass climate change" – UN expert|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paris Agreement''', as adopted on the 12 December 2015 at the Conference of the Parties, is the most important indication of increasing awareness towards the relationship between climate change and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment|date=1 February 2016|issue=A/HRC/31/52|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2729611}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Agreement is the first climate agreement to recognise the relevance of human rights, stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNFCCC|date=12 December 2015|title=Adoption of the Paris Agreement|url=https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf|issue=FCCC/CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Human rights law and climate change ==
Climate change is inducing not only ecological adjustments, but is also impacting the social, economic, political, cultural and legal aspects of societies around the world. The HRC has affirmed that human rights obligations have the ability to strengthen both international and national policy-making in the area of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 10/4, Human rights and climate change|date=25 March 2009|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_10_4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Declaration]] provided the basis for further elaboration of a human right to environmental quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/271647969|title=International law and the environment|last=W.|first=Birnie, Patricia|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Boyle, Alan E., Redgwell, Catherine.|isbn=9780198764229|edition=3rd|location=Oxford|oclc=271647969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental protection is not commonly included in human rights treaties. Rather environmental protection is derived from the rights that those treaties protect, such as the rights to life, food and water and health.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/724352139|title=Human rights and climate change : a review of the international legal dimensions.|last=1974-|first=McInerney-Lankford, Siobhán Alice,|date=2011|publisher=World Bank|others=Darrow, Mac., Rajamani, Lavanya., World Bank.|isbn=9780821387207|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=724352139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving forward, human rights law in the context of climate change policy-making may help to establish minimum standards of basic human rights that can be adopted in international and national mitigation and adaption measures.

==Rights implicated==
	Most international statements on human rights and climate change have emphasized the potential adverse impacts of climate change on the rights to [[right to life|life]], [[right to food|food]], [[right to water|water]], [[right to health|health]], [[right to housing|housing]], [[right to development|development]], and [[right to self-determination|self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Malé Declaration, n.4; UNHRC Resolution 18/22, n.7; A/HRC/10/61, n.8; FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, n.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human rights, climate change and cross-border displacement|url = http://www.universal-rights.org/urg-policy-reports/human-rights-climate-change-and-cross-border-displacement-the-role-of-the-international-human-rights-community-in-contributing-to-effective-and-just-solutions/|website = Universal Rights Group|access-date = 2016-02-10|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights are enumerated in the core conventions of [[international human rights law]], though not all HRC members or UNFCCC parties are signatories of these conventions.

=== Right to life ===
The right to life is protected by Article 6 of the ICCPR where every human being has the inherent right to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=OHCRC|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|date=23 March 1976|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/ccpr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to life is inextricably linked to the measure of fulfilment of other rights. There are both projected and observed effects that climate change will have on the right to life. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] ('''IPCC''') [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|fourth assessment report]] projected an increase in people suffering from death and injury occurring from an increase in floods, storms, heatwaves, fires and droughts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights|date=15 January 2009|issue=A/HRC/10/61|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Press/AnalyticalStudy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change will equally affect the right to life through an increase in hunger and malnutrition and related disorder impacting child growth and development, respiratory morbidity and ground-level ozone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rising sea levels is one of the flow-on effects of climate change, resulting from warming water and melting ice sheets.  Measuring sea level rise is a complicated affair, however the IPCC have projected an increase in global mean sea level&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sealevel.colorado.edu/content/what-definition-global-mean-sea-level-gmsl-and-its-rate|title=What is the definition of global mean sea level (GMSL) and its rate? {{!}} CU Sea Level Research Group|website=sealevel.colorado.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; of between 0.44m and 0.74m by 2100.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=IPCC|first=|date=2007|title=Fourth Assessment Report|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_full_report.pdf|journal=|volume=|issue=AR4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For low-lying coastal islands such as Male', in the Maldives, a sea level rise of 0.5 metres would inundate 15 per cent of the island by 2025, and flood half of it by 2100.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As 42 per cent of the population lives within 100m within the coastline, even partial flooding is likely to result in drowning, injury and loss of life.

Observed effects are those where the right to life has already inhibited the right to life. There is difficulty in studying the impacts of climate change itself because of the issue of scale; climate change is measured in decades.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There is more than 95 per cent chance that [[anthropogenic climate change]] quadrupled the risk of extreme summer heat events in Europe in the decade 1998 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christidis|first=Nikolaos|last2=Stott|first2=Peter A.|last3=Jones|first3=Gareth S.|last4=Shiogama|first4=Hideo|last5=Nozawa|first5=Toru|last6=Luterbacher|first6=Jürg|date=2012-02-01|title=Human activity and anomalously warm seasons in Europe|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.2262/abstract|journal=International Journal of Climatology|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=225–239|doi=10.1002/joc.2262|issn=1097-0088}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a probability of 75 per cent that the 2003 heat wave in Europe was attributable to climate change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On this basis, the excess mortality rate from this event registered at 15,000 deaths in France alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fouillet|first=A.|last2=Rey|first2=G.|last3=Laurent|first3=F.|last4=Pavillon|first4=G.|last5=Bellec|first5=S.|last6=Guihenneuc-Jouyaux|first6=C.|last7=Clavel|first7=J.|last8=Jougla|first8=E.|last9=Hémon|first9=Denis|title=Excess mortality related to the August 2003 heat wave in France|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00420-006-0089-4|journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health|language=en|volume=80|issue=1|pages=16–24|doi=10.1007/s00420-006-0089-4|issn=0340-0131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to food ===
This is derived from Article II of the ICESCR where States party to the Covenant have to maximise their available resources to the achieve the right to adequate food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1966}}: article 2(1), 11(1) and 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change is going to affect all four pillars of [[food security]]; availability, access, utilization and stability. A 2008 report by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food has stated that the way the world grows food will have to undergo radical change to cope with a growing population and the effects of climate change, while avoiding environmental collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Schutter|first=Olivier|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Building resilience: a human rights framework for world food and nutrition security |date=8 September 2008|issue=A/HRC/9/23|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/food/docs/A.HRC.9.23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Agreement recognises the fundamental priority of ensuring food security and the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Article 2 calls for adaption to the adverse impacts of climate change and the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions in a manner that will not threaten food production.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The IPCC fourth assessment report projects that food production will increase in the mid to high latitudes with a temperature increase of between 1° and 3&amp;nbsp;°C, however at lower latitudes crop productivity is set to decrease which increases the risk of food insecurity in poorer regions of the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[United Nations Development Programme]] estimate an additional 600 million people will face malnutrition due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNDP|first=|date=2007|title=Fighting climate change: Human solidarity in a divided world|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/corporate/HDR/2006%20Global%20HDR/HDR-2006-Beyond%20scarcity-Power-poverty-and-the-global-water-crisis.pdf|journal=Human Development Report|volume=|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely to have a particularly devastating effect on Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=IPCC|title=Working Group II Report|date=2007|issue=AR4|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4_wg2_full_report.pdf|pages=275|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to water ===
The [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ('''CESCR''') notes that the right to water is not only an essential condition to survival, but also that it is inextricably linked with other rights, such as; [[right to housing|housing]], [[right to health|attainable standard of health]], [[right to an adequate standard of living|adequate standard of living]], and [[right to food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=CESCR|title=General Comment No. 15: The Right to Water (Arts. 11 and 12 of the Covenant)  |date=20 January 2003|issue=E/C.12/2002/11|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4538838d11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stern Review]] states that people will feel the effects of climate change the most strongly through changes in patterns of water distribution around the globe.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006-12-01|title=The Stern Review on the Economic Effects of Climate Change|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00153.x/abstract|journal=Population and Development Review|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00153.x|issn=1728-4457|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those areas that are already experiencing dry conditions will experience a further decrease in water availability, with several (but not all) climate models predicting up to a 30 per cent decrease in annual run-off in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of southern Africa and South America for a 2&amp;nbsp;°C global temperature rise, and 40 – 50 per cent for 4&amp;nbsp;°C rise.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/652432164|title=Human rights and climate change|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Humphreys, Stephen.|year=|isbn=9780521762762|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=652432164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|IPCC fifth assessment report]] states that freshwater-related risks increase significantly with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, with climate change over the 21st century projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater resources significantly in most dry subtropical regions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=IPCC|first=|date=2014|title=IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf|journal=|volume=AR5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to health ===
Article 12 of the '''ICESCR''' identifies the "right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most national constitutions protect the right to health in some manner, and it is widely safeguarded in other international and regional instruments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Rights and Climate Change : A Review of the International Legal Dimensions|last1=McInerney-Lankford|first1=Siobhan|last2=Darrow|first2=Mac|last3=Rajamani|first3=Lavanya|publisher=World Bank Publications|year=2011|isbn=9780821387207|location=|pages=|at=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change is going to amplify health disparities between the rich and poor in different parts of the world. The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]] ('''WHO''') estimates that since 1970, climate change is responsible for 150,000 deaths every year through increasing incidence in the spread of diarrhoea, malaria and malnutrition predominantly in Africa and other developing regions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Just a 1&amp;nbsp;°C increase in global temperature from pre-industrial levels could double the annual deaths from climate change (according to WHO).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Specific issues==

===Displacement===
Potential climate induced migration is currently one of the most disputed flow-on effects from climate change. Research suggests that climate change may create some 50 to 200 million new [[internally displaced persons]] and international [[refugees]] by the year 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Docherty|first=Bonnie|author2=Tyler Giannini|title=Confronting a Rising Tide: A Proposal for a Convention on Climage Change Refugees|journal=Harvard Environmental Law Review|year=2009|volume=33|pages=349–403|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/elr/vol33_2/Docherty%20Giannini.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mega-deltas" in Asia, Africa, and small islands are at high risk of floods and storms, which will cause large-scale displacement of the local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/displacement-caused-by-the-effects-of-climate-change-who-will-be-affected-and-what-are-the-gaps-in-the-normative-framework-for-their-protection/|title=Displacement Caused by the Effects of Climate Change: Who Will Be Affected and What Are the Gaps in the Normative Framework for Their Protection? {{!}} Brookings Institution|date=2017-02-16|newspaper=Brookings|access-date=2017-02-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change induced migration will either affect or violate basic international human right norms.

=== Climate justice ===
There is significant discussion around the concept of climate justice for the [[environmental migrant]] or 'climate refugee'. This concept aims to fill a gap in the legal and political sectors for the millions of people that are not able to receive international legal protection as this source of migration is yet to be included in regional and international law.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987699915|title=Climate change, migration and human rights law and policy perspectives|others=Manou, Dimitra,, Baldwin, Andrew, 1970-, Cubie, Dug,, Mihr, Anja, 1969-, Thorp, Teresa M., 1968-|isbn=9781317222330|location=London|oclc=987699915}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently no established definition for who can be classified as a climate refugee because it has not yet been enshrined in international law. In 2014 Siego Alesana left the [[Small Island Developing States|small island developing state]] of [[Tuvalu]] because of the uncertainty surrounding the adverse effects of climate change.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|title=AD (Tuvalu )|date=4 June 2014|url=http://www.nzlii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/nz/cases/NZIPT/2014/501370.html?query=AD%20(Tuvalu)|issue=501370|accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvalu is only 4.6m above sea level and faces the imminent danger posed by rising sea levels. Although the impacts of climate change were put forward on behalf of Alesana and his family, the case rested largely on humanitarian grounds. However the [[Immigration and Protection Tribunal]] did state that environmental degradation caused by climate change was already a feature of life in Tuvalu.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Although this decision wasn't based on impacts of climate change that is not to say that climate change related factors weren't taken into consideration at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vernonrive.com/home/climate-refugees-revisited-a-closer-look-at-the-tuvalu-decision|title="Climate refugees" revisited: a closer look at the Tuvalu decision|website=Vernon Rive|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization for Migration]] has put forward a working definition of environmental migrant:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iom.int/definitional-issues|title=Definitional Issues|date=2015-01-29|work=International Organization for Migration|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Environmental migrants are persons or groups of persons who, predominantly for reasons of sudden or progressive change in the environment that adversely affects their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move within their country or abroad.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Until there is a legally binding definition of what constitutes an environmental migrant, it will be difficult for any true justice to be served. The concept of climate justice would see all human rights implemented in the most transparent way in order to maintain basic standards in the face of the somewhat unknown impacts that will be created by climate change.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Conflict===
International peacebuilding NGO [[International Alert]] names 46 countries where climate change effects (including water scarcity, loss of arable land, extreme weather events, shortened growing seasons, and melting glaciers) may interact with economic, social, and political forces to create "a high risk of violent conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dan|author2=Janani Vivekananda|title=A CLIMATE OF CONFLICT: The links between climate change, peace and war|journal=International Alert|date=November 2007|url=http://www.international-alert.org/sites/default/files/publications/A_climate_of_conflict.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous peoples===
[[Indigenous peoples]] have a unique position when it comes to discussion of the impacts climate change will have on a population. Many indigenous populations live subsistence lifestyles, which in turn are disrupted severely when it comes to the impact of climate change. In many countries, municipal law differs in application to indigenous peoples than the rest of the population which complicates any legal remedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811732784|title=Climate change and Indigenous peoples : the search for legal remedies|date=2013|publisher=Edward Elgar|others=Abate, Randall., Kronk, Elizabeth Ann.|isbn=9781783474172|location=Cheltenham, UK|oclc=811732784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change impacts indigenous peoples differently not only because of their physical and spiritual connections to the land and water, but also because they have a specialised ecological and traditional knowledge that can be used to find the best mitigation strategy of those effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerrard|first=Emily|date=2008|title=Climate change and human rights : issues and opportunities for Indigenous peoples|url=|journal=University of New South Wales Law Journal|volume=31|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN Human Rights organs have identified the [[rights of indigenous peoples]] as particularly vulnerable to the disruptive effects of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;OHCHR: Climate change and indigenous peoples, http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/ClimateChangeIP.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hampson|first=Françoise|title=THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN STATES AND TERRITORIES THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS|date=13 July 2004|issue=E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.4/2004/CRP.1|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/IPeoples/WG/crp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to climate change, indigenous people have been threatened with their livelihood and cultural idententies across the world North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Approximately 370 million indigenous people are affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Jay|date=2012-05-01|title=The impact of climate change on indigenous people – the implications for the cultural, spiritual, economic and legal rights of indigenous people|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13642987.2011.632135|journal=The International Journal of Human Rights|volume=16|issue=4|pages=648–688|doi=10.1080/13642987.2011.632135|issn=1364-2987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child Rights===
Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] identified that children in South Asia may be particularly vulnerable to violations of human rights following climate related disasters. These can include gender-based violence, child labour, family break-ups and barriers to their development and learning. The researchers argue that [[child rights]] are rarely prioritised in policies to reduce disaster risk or adapt to climate change and that [[climate change adaptation]] policies must tailor interventions to address critical aspects of child rights, particularly child protection and education.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Harris and Kelly Hawrylyshyn, Climate extremes and child rights in South Asia: a neglected priority, http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/7832.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Given that many of the world's poorest citizens depend directly on the environment for all or part of their daily livelihoods, many international development agencies see climate change and development as "inextricably linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=U.S. Agency for International Development|title=Integrating Climate Change into Development|date=November 2008|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACM036.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|author2=The World Bank|title=DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE A Strategic Framework for the World Bank Group|year=2008|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTCC/Resources/407863-1219339233881/DCCSFTechnicalReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khoday|first=Kishan|title=Climate Change and the Right to Development.

== History ==
At the late of 1970s, Egypt was motivated to build eight [[nuclear power plant]]s and to develop experience at the back end of a [[nuclear fuel cycle]] and was concluded several contracts with an unnamed foreign company to build the Hydrometallurgy Pilot Plant (HPP).&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;

HPP was originally designed as a [[nuclear reprocessing]] facility,&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;&lt;ref name=ffi&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gabrielsen|first1=Andreas|title=Drivers of nuclear weapons proliferation in Egypt and Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.ffi.no/no/Rapporter/13-02307.pdf|website=[[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment]]|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1982, the second laboratory became operational.&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;

== Overview ==
The HPP consists of three laboratories, the first laboratory consists of three hot cells (modules 1-3)&lt;ref name=nti /&gt; with the first module, is [[radiation protection|shielded]] [[alpha particle]] cell dedicated for mechanical shearing of research reactor fuel, it was unfinished due to the inability to secure the necessary export licence for the shearing equipment from the foreign vendor. The second module, is dissolver and [[mixer-settler]]s for first stage fission product separation. The third module, was designed for [[radioactive waste#Vitrification|waste vitrification]] with no equipment had been installed.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;

In November 2004 and January 2005, Egypt declared that, in 1987, it had carried out [[acceptance test]]s in the HPP using unirradiated [[uranyl nitrate]] in chemical reagents purchased from the local market while the uranyl nitrate had been mixed with a solution obtained from the dissolution of domestically produced scrap [[UO2]] pellets (with 1.9&amp;nbsp;kg of uranium compounds). Egypt rationalized that it did not inform the IAEA about the facility, materials nor their use in the tests as the HPP never completed and it was designed for bench scale radiochemistry experiments, while Egypt should declared the HPP to the Agency as early as possible prior to the introduction of nuclear material into the facility, according to the [[IAEA safeguards|Safeguards Agreement]] which came into forece in 1982.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt; Therefore, Between 2004 and 2006, Egypt had submitted design information for the HPP and had provide inventory change reports (ICRs) with respect to the acceptance tests.&lt;ref name=wikileaks /&gt;

[[File:Pollution de l'air.jpg|thumb|Pollution from a factory]]
'''I = PAT''' is the mathematical notation of a formula put forward to describe the [[human impacts on the environment|impact of human activity on the environment]].

:'''I''' = '''P''' × '''A''' × '''T'''

The expression equates [[Environmental issue|human impact on the environment]] to the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of three [[independent variable|factors]]: [[World population|Population]], [[Affluence]], and [[Technology]]. It is similar in form to the [[Kaya identity]] which applies specifically to emissions of the [[greenhouse gas]] [[carbon dioxide]].

The validity of expressing environmental impact as a simple product of independent factors, and the factors that should be included and their comparative importance, have been the subject of debate among environmentalists. In particular, some have drawn attention to potential inter-relationships among the three factors; and others have wished to stress other factors not included in the formula, such as political and social structures, and the scope for beneficial, as well as harmful, environmental actions.

==History==
The equation was developed in 1970 during the course of a debate between [[Barry Commoner]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[John Holdren]]. Commoner argued that [[environmental impact]]s in the United States were caused primarily by changes in its production technology following [[World War II]] and aimed his thoughts on present day deteriorating environmental conditions in the U.S. Ehrlich and Holdren argued that all three factors were important and emphasized in particular the role of human [[population growth]], but focused more on a broader scale, being less specific in space and time.&lt;ref name ="End of Population Growth"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = B.C. |last2 = MacKellar | first2 = F.L. | first3 = W.| last3= Lutz | date = 2004 | chapter = Population, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change | title = The End of World Population Growth in the 21st Century: New Challenges for Human Capital Formation &amp; Sustainable Development | editor1-first = W. | editor1-last = Lutz | editor2-first = W.C. | editor2-last= Sanderson | editor3-first= S. | editor3-last = Scherbov | publisher = Earthscan Press | location = London | pages = 283–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ehrlich  | first1 = Paul R.  | authorlink1 = Paul R.

The equation can aid in understanding some of the factors affecting human impacts on the environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chertow | first1 = M. R. | authorlink1 = Marian Chertow| title = The IPAT Equation and Its Variants | doi = 10.1162/10881980052541927 | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 13–29 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has also been cited as a basis for many of the dire environmental predictions of the 1970s by [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]], [[George Wald]], [[Denis Hayes]], [[Lester R. Brown|Lester Brown]], [[René Dubos]], and [[Sidney Dillon Ripley|Sidney Ripley]] that did not come to pass.&lt;ref name="bailey_2000"&gt;[[Ronald Bailey|R Bailey]] (2000) ''Earth day then and now'', [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] '''32'''(1), 18-28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neal Koblitz]] classified equations of this type as "mathematical [[propaganda]]" and criticized Ehrlich's use of them in the media (e.g. on [[The Tonight Show]]) to sway the general public.&lt;ref name="koblitz_1981"&gt;[[Neal Koblitz|N Koblitz]] (1981) "Mathematics as Propaganda", in ''Mathematics Tomorrow'', ed. [[Lynn Steen]], pp 111-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dependent variable: Impact==
&lt;!-- A definition of impact was missing. Added here.  --&gt;

The variable "I" in the "I=PAT" equation represents environmental impact. The environment may be viewed as a self-regenerating system that can sustain a certain level of impact sustainably. The maximum sustainable impact is called the [[carrying capacity]]. As long as "I" is less than this amount the associated population, affluence, and technology that make up "I" are sustainable. If "I" exceeds the carrying capacity, then the system is said to be in [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot]], which can only be a temporary state. Overshoot may degrade the ability of the environment to sustain impact, therefore reducing the carrying capacity.

Impact may be measured using [[ecological footprint]] analysis in units of [[global hectares]] (gha). Ecological footprint per capita is a measure of the quantity of  Earth's biologically productive surface that is needed to regenerate the resources consumed per capita.

Impact is modeled as the product of three terms, giving gha as a result. Population is expressed in human numbers, therefore Affluence is measured in units of gha per capita. Technology is a unitless efficiency  factor.

==The three factors==
===Population===
{{See also|World population|Human overpopulation}}

[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|right|Population (est.) 10,000 BC – 2000 AD.]]

In the '''I=PAT''' equation, the variable '''P''' represents the population of an area, such as the world. Since the rise of industrial societies, human population has been increasing exponentially. This has caused [[Thomas Malthus]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] and many others{{Who|date=February 2011}} to postulate that this growth would continue until checked by widespread hunger and famine (see [[Malthusian growth model]]).

The United Nations project that world population will increase from 7.6 billion today (2018) to 9.8 billion in 2050 and about 11.2 billion in 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf|title=Population Prospects 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These projections take into consideration that population growth has slowed in recent years as women are having fewer children. This phenomenon is the result of [[demographic transition]] all over the world. The UN projects that human population might stabilize around 11.2 billion in 2100 (up from 9.2 billion).&lt;ref name="End of Population Growth"/&gt; However, since the world population is set to keep rising for the next few decades, this factor of the '''I=PAT''' equation will likely keep increasing [[human impact on the environment]] for the near future.

====Environmental impacts of population====
Increased population increases humans' environmental impact in many ways, which include but are not limited to:

* Increased [[land use]] - Results in habitat loss for other species.
* Increased [[resource use]] - Results in changes in land cover
* Increased [[pollution]] - Can cause sickness and damages [[ecosystem]]s.

===Affluence===
{{Main|Consumption (economics)}}

[[File:World GDP Capita 1-2003 A.D.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|right|World GDP per capita (in 1990 [[Geary-Khamis dollars]])]]

The variable '''A''', in the '''I=PAT''' equation stands for [[affluence]]. It represents the average consumption of each person in the population. As the consumption of each person increases, the total environmental impact increases as well. A common proxy for measuring consumption is through [[GDP per capita]]. While GDP per capita measures production, it is often assumed that consumption increases when production increases.  GDP per capita has been rising steadily over the last few centuries and is driving up human impact in the '''I=PAT''' equation.

====Environmental impacts of affluence====
&lt;!-- Not a great example - needs fleshing out; number of automobiles per capita would be a better example, as it changes, ... --&gt;

Increased consumption significantly increases human environmental impact. This is because each product consumed has wide-ranging effects on the environment. For example, the construction of a car has the following environmental impacts:

* 605,664 gallons of water for parts and tires&lt;ref name ="Phillis"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Andriantiatsaholiniaina | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Kouikoglou | first2 = V. S. | last3 = Phillis | first3 = Y. A. | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2003.08.009 | title = Evaluating strategies for sustainable development: Fuzzy logic reasoning and sensitivity analysis |journal = [[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]| volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 149 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 682&amp;nbsp;lbs. of pollution at a mine for the [[lead battery]].&lt;ref name ="Phillis" /&gt;
* 2178&amp;nbsp;lbs. of discharge into water supply for the 22&amp;nbsp;lbs. of copper contained in the car.&lt;ref name ="Phillis" /&gt;

The more cars per capita, the greater the impact.
Ecological impacts of each product are far reaching, increases in consumption quickly result in large impacts on the environment through direct and indirect sources.

===Technology===
{{See also|Environmental technology|Appropriate technology}}

The '''T''' variable in the '''I=PAT''' equation represents how resource intensive the production of affluence is; how much environmental impact is involved in creating, transporting and disposing of the goods, services and amenities used.  Improvements in efficiency can reduce resource intensiveness, reducing the T multiplier.  Since technology can affect environmental impact in many different ways, the unit for '''T''' is often tailored for the situation '''I=PAT''' is being applied to. For example, for a situation where the human impact on climate change is being measured, an appropriate unit for '''T''' might be greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP.

====Environmental impacts of technology====
Increases in efficiency can reduce overall environmental impact. However, since '''P''' has increased exponentially, and '''A''' has also increased drastically, the overall environmental impact, '''I''', has still increased.

==Criticism==
[[File:Native American fishing at Willamette Falls.jpg|thumb|Native American Fishing Practices (Low Technology) have a vastly smaller Impact than Industrialized Fishing]]
Criticisms of the "I=PAT" formula
* Too Simplistic for complex problem
* Inter dependencies between variables
* General sweeping assumptions of variables’ effect toward environmental impact
* Cultural differences cause wide variation in impact
* Technology cannot properly be expressed in a unit. Varying the unit will prove to be inaccurate, as the result of the calculation depends on one’s view of the situation

===Interdependencies===
The I=PAT equation has been criticized for being too simplistic by assuming that P, A, and T are independent of each other. In reality, at least 7 interdependencies between P, A, and T could exist, indicating that it is more correct to rewrite the equation as I = f(P,A,T).&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alcott | first1 = B. | title = Impact caps: Why population, affluence and technology strategies should be abandoned | doi = 10.1016/j.jclepro.2009.08.001 | journal = [[Journal of Cleaner Production]] | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 552–560 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a doubling of technological efficiency, or equivalently a reduction of the T-factor by 50%, does not necessarily reduce the environmental impact (I) by 50% if efficiency induced price reductions stimulate additional consumption of the resource that was supposed to be conserved, a phenomenon called the [[rebound effect (conservation)]] or [[Jevons Paradox]].  As was shown by Alcott,&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010" /&gt;{{rp|Fig. 5}} despite significant improvements in the carbon intensity of GDP (i.e., the efficiency in carbon use) since 1980, world fossil energy consumption has increased in line with economic and population growth. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of energy and material use were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011).

===Neglect of beneficial human impacts===
There have also been comments that this model depicts people as being purely detrimental to the environment, ignoring any [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] or [[Environmental restoration|restoration]] efforts that societies have made.&lt;ref name=moseley242&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to Human-Environment Geography: Local Dynamics and Global Processes |last=Moseley |first=William |last2=Perramond |first2=Eric |last3=Hapke |first3=Holly |last4=Laris |first4=Paul |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |year=2014 |isbn=9781405189316 |location=Hoboken, NJ |pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neglect of political and social contexts===
Another major criticism of the I=PAT model is that it ignores the political context and decision making structures of countries and groups. This means the equation does not account for varying degrees of power, influence, and responsibility of individuals over environmental impact.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; Also, the P factor does not account for the complexity of social structures or behaviors, resulting in blame being placed on the global poor.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; I=PAT does not account for sustainable resource use among some poor and indigenous populations, unfairly characterizing these populations whose cultures support low impact practices.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; However, the latter criticism not only assumes low impacts for indigenous populations, but also misunderstands the I=PAT equation itself. Environmental impact is a function of human numbers, affluence (ie resources consumed per capita) and technology. It is assumed that small scale societies have low environmental impacts due to their practices and orientations alone but there is little evidence to support this&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Primitive polluters : Semang impact on the Malaysian tropical rain forest ecosystem |last=Rambo |first=A. Terry |date=1985 |publisher=Museum of Anthropology, University of Michigan |isbn=0915703041 |location=Ann Arbor, Mich. |oclc=13516436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The ecological Indian : myth and history |last=Krech |first=Shepard, III |date=1999 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co |isbn=0393321002 |edition=1st |location=New York |oclc=40762824}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact the generally low impact of small scale societies compared to state societies is due to a combination of their small numbers and low level technology. Thus, the environmental sustainability of these societies is largely an epiphenomenon due their ''inability'' to significantly affect their environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Eric Alden|last2=Wishnie|first2=Mark|date=2000|title=Conservation and Subsistence in Small-Scale Societies|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.29.1.493|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=29|issue=1|pages=493–524|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.29.1.493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hames|first=Raymond|date=2007|title=The Ecologically Noble Savage Debate|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123321|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=36|issue=1|pages=177–190 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123321}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That all types of societies are subject to I=PAT was actually made clear in Ehrlich and Holdren's 1972 dialogue with Commoner in ''The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists''&lt;ref name=BAS1/&gt; where they examine the pre-industrial (and indeed prehistoric) impact of human beings on the environment. Their position is further clarified by Holdren's 1993 paper, ''A Brief History of "IPAT"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://mahb.stanford.edu/blog/review-anthrozoology/|title=Paul Ehrlich reviews Tobias and Morrison’s most recent book –“Anthrozoology: Embracing Co-Existence in the Anthropocene” |date=2017-01-31|work=MAHB|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Policy implications===
As a result of the interdependencies between P, A, and T and potential rebound effects, policies aimed at decreasing environmental impacts through reductions in P, A, and T may not only be very difficult to implement (e.g., [[population control]] and material sufficiency and [[degrowth]] movements have been very controversial) but also are likely to be rather ineffective compared to rationing (i.e., quotas) or [[Pigovian tax|Pigouvian taxation]] of resource use or pollution.&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010"/&gt;

Tham|accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the situation in a [[PID feedback controller]] where a large change in setpoint occurs (say a positive change) and the integral terms accumulates a significant error during the rise (windup), thus [[overshoot (signal)|overshooting]] and continuing to increase as this accumulated error is unwound (offset by errors in the other direction). The specific problem is the excess overshooting.

== Solutions ==
This problem can be addressed by
* Initialising the controller integral to a desired value, for instance to the value before the problem
* Increasing the setpoint in a suitable ramp
* Disabling the integral function until the to-be-controlled [[process variable]] (PV) has entered the controllable region
* Preventing the integral term from accumulating above or below pre-determined bounds
* Back-calculating the integral term to constrain the process output within feasible bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Douglas|title=Integral (Reset) Windup, Jacketing Logic and the Velocity PI Form|url=http://www.controlguru.com/2008/021008.html|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Integral windup particularly occurs as a limitation of physical systems, compared with ideal systems, due to the ideal output being physically impossible (process [[Wiktionary:saturation|saturation]]: the output of the process being limited at the top or bottom of its scale, making the error constant). For example, the position of a valve cannot be any more open than fully open and also cannot be closed any more than fully closed. In this case, anti-windup can actually involve the integrator being turned off for periods of time until the response falls back into an acceptable range.

This usually occurs when the controller's output can no longer affect the controlled variable, or if the controller is part of a selection scheme and it is selected right.

Integral windup was more of a problem in [[analog electronics|analog]] controllers. Within modern [[Distributed Control System]]s and [[Programmable Logic Controller]]s, it is much easier to prevent integral windup by either limiting the controller output, or by using external reset feedback, which is a means of feeding back the selected output to the integral circuit of all controllers in the selection scheme so that a [[PID controller|closed loop]] is maintained.

{{Architecture of Italy}}
'''Italian Baroque architecture''' refers to [[baroque architecture]] in [[Italy]].

==Central Italy==
===Rome===
[[File:Palazzo Barberini at night.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Palazzo Barberini]] at night.]]
The sacred architecture of the Baroque period had its beginnings in the Italian [[paradigm]] of the [[basilica]] with [[crossed dome]] and [[nave]]. One of the first Roman structures to break with the [[Mannerist]] conventions exemplified in [[Church of the Gesu|the Gesù]], was the church of [[Santa Susanna]], designed by [[Carlo Maderno]] in 1596. The dynamic rhythm of columns and pilasters, central massing, and the protrusion and condensed central decoration add complexity to the structure. There is an incipient playfulness with the rules of classic design, still maintaining rigor. They had domed roofs.

The same emphasis on plasticity, continuity and dramatic effects is evident in the work of [[Pietro da Cortona]], illustrated by [[San Luca e Santa Martina]] (1635) and [[Santa Maria della Pace]] (1656). The latter building, with concave wings devised to simulate a theatrical set, presses forward to fill a tiny piazza in front of it. Other Roman ensembles of the period are likewise suffused with theatricality, dominating the surrounding cityscape as a sort of theatrical environment.

Probably the best known example of such an approach is trapezoidal [[Saint Peter's Square]], which has been praised as a masterstroke of Baroque theatre. The square is shaped by two colonnades, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] on an unprecedented colossal scale to suit the space and provide emotions of awe. Bernini's own favourite design was the polychromatic oval church of [[Sant'Andrea al Quirinale]] (1658), which, with its lofty altar and soaring dome, provides a concentrated sampling of the new architecture. His idea of the Baroque townhouse is typified by the [[Palazzo Barberini]] (1629) and [[Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi]] (1664), both in Rome.

[[File:RomaSIvoSapienzaCupola.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]]: [[Francesco Borromini]]]]

Bernini's chief rival in the papal capital was [[Francesco Borromini]], whose designs deviate from the regular compositions of the ancient world and Renaissance even more dramatically. Acclaimed by later generations as a revolutionary in architecture, Borromini condemned the anthropomorphic approach of the 16th century, choosing to base his designs on complicated geometric figures (modules). Borromini's architectural space seems to expand and contract when needed, showing some affinity with the late style of [[Michelangelo]]. His iconic masterpiece is the diminutive church of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]], distinguished by a corrugated oval plan and complex convex-concave rhythms. A later work, [[Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza]], displays the same antipathy to the flat surface and playful inventiveness, epitomized by a corkscrew lantern dome.

Following the death of Bernini in 1680, [[Carlo Fontana]] emerged as the most influential architect working in [[Rome]]. His early style is exemplified by the slightly concave façade of [[San Marcello al Corso]]). Fontana's academic approach, though lacking in the dazzling inventiveness of his Roman predecessors, exerted substantial influence on Baroque architecture both through his prolific writings and through a number of architects whom he trained and who would disseminate the Baroque idioms throughout 18th-century Europe.

The 18th century saw the capital of Europe's architectural world transferred from Rome to [[Paris]]. The Italian [[Rococo]], which flourished in Rome from the 1720s onward, was profoundly influenced by the ideas of Borromini. The most talented architects active in Rome — [[Francesco de Sanctis (architect)|Francesco de Sanctis]] ([[Spanish Steps]], 1723) and [[Filippo Raguzzini]] ([[Piazza Sant'Ignazio]], 1727) — had little influence outside their native country, as did numerous practitioners of the [[Sicilian Baroque]], including [[Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]], [[Andrea Palma]], and [[Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia]].

==Southern Italy==

===Naples===
[[File:Reggia di Caserta.png|right|200px|thumb|The Baroque [[Palace of Caserta]] in [[Caserta]], near Naples.]]
The last phase of Baroque architecture in Italy is exemplified by [[Luigi Vanvitelli]]'s [[Caserta Palace]], reputedly the largest building erected in Europe in the 18th century. Indebted to contemporary French and Spanish models, the palace is skillfully related to the landscape. At Naples and Caserta, Vanvitelli practiced a sober classicizing academic style, with equal attention to [[aesthetics]] and engineering, a style that would make an easy transition to [[Neoclassicism]].

===Sicily===
{{main|Sicilian Baroque}}
[[File:Duomo San Giorgio.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The baroque Duomo of San Giorgio in [[Ragusa, Italy]], on the island of Sicily.]]
[[Sicilian Baroque]] is the distinctive form of [[Baroque architecture]] that took hold on the island of [[Sicily]], off the southern coast of Italy, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The style is recognizable not only by its typical Baroque curves and flourishes, but also by its grinning [[mask]]s and [[putto|putti]] and a particular flamboyance that has given Sicily a unique architectural identity.

The Sicilian Baroque style came to fruition during a major surge of rebuilding following a massive [[1693 Sicily earthquake|earthquake in 1693]]. Previously, the Baroque style had been used on the island in a naïve and [[parochialism|parochial]] manner, having evolved from [[Cross-genre|hybrid]] native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of Rome. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural [[engraving]]s that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence in their use of the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly-fashionable [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]].

The highly decorative Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years, and perfectly reflected the [[social order]] of the island at a time when, nominally ruled by Spain, it was in fact governed by a wealthy and often extravagant [[aristocracy]] into whose hands ownership of the primarily agricultural economy was highly concentrated. Its Baroque architecture gives the island an architectural character that has lasted into the 21st century.

==North Italy==

===Turin===
[[File:Mg-k Basilica Superga1.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Basilica di Superga near [[Turin]]: [[Filippo Juvarra]]]]
In the north of Italy, notably [[Turin]], the monarchs from the [[House of Savoy]] were particularly receptive to the new style. They employed a brilliant triad of architects—[[Guarino Guarini]], [[Filippo Juvarra]] and [[Bernardo Vittone]]—to illustrate the grandiose political ambitions and the newly acquired royal status of their dynasty.

Guarini was a peripatetic monk who combined many traditions (including that of [[Gothic architecture]]) to create irregular structures remarkable for their oval columns and unconventional façades. Building upon the findings of contemporary geometry and [[stereotomy (architecture)|stereotomy]], Guarini elaborated the concept of ''architectura obliqua'', which approximated Borromini's style in both theoretical and structural audacity. Guarini's [[Palazzo Carignano]] (1679) may have been the most flamboyant application of the Baroque style to the design of a private house in the 17th century.

Fluid forms, weightless details and airy prospects of Juvarra's architecture anticipated the art of [[Rococo]]. Although his practice ranged well beyond [[Turin]], Juvarra's most arresting designs were created for [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia]]. The visual impact of his [[Basilica di Superga]] (1717) derives from its soaring roofline and masterful placement on a hill above Turin. Rustic ambience encouraged a freer articulation of architectural form at the royal hunting lodge of the [[Palazzina di Stupinigi]] (1729). Juvarra finished his short but eventful career in Madrid, where he worked on the royal palaces at [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]] and [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Aranjuez]].

Among the many who were profoundly influenced by the brilliance and diversity of Juvarra and Guarini none was more important than [[Bernardo Vittone]]. This Piedmontese architect is remembered for an outcrop of flamboyant [[Rococo]] churches, quatrefoil in plan and delicate in detailing. His sophisticated designs often feature multiple vaults, structures within structures and domes within domes.

===Milan===
[[File:IMG 4512 - Milano - Palazzo Litta - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 20-jan 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The baroque [[Palazzo Litta]] in Milan.]]
[[Francesco Maria Richini]] (1584-1658) was the most important [[Milan]]ese architect.&lt;ref name="Diz"&gt;N. Pevsner, J. Fleming, H. Honour, ''Dizionario di architettura'', cit., voce ''Richini, Francesco Maria''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1607 and 1630 he built the Church of [[San Giuseppe (Milan)|San Giuseppe]], which, like [[Chiesa del Gesù]] in Rome, was meant to practice the excess over the Mannerist academic vogue until then.&lt;ref name="Diz"/&gt;
Richini introduced a combined plan, consisting of two central areas derived from Chiesa di [[Sant'Alessandro in Zebedia|Sant' Alessandro]], also in Milan; the plastic effect is also noticeable in the façade, decorated by a series of overlapping niches.

Subsequently, in 1627 he devoted himself to the façade of the [[Palazzo del Senato (Milan)|Collegio Elvetico]] (now the seat of ''Archivio di Stato''), where he aimed at an integration between the interior and exterior through a concave prospectus. This interesting solution, possibly the first curved façade of the Baroque period, predates certain themes later expressed by Borromini, and confirms Richini as one of the greatest architects of the early Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;C. Norberg - Schulz, ''Architettura Barocca'', cit., p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venice===
[[Image:Venedig s maria della salut.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute]], [[Venice]]]]

The Venetian Baroque, according to local practice,&lt;ref&gt;C. Norberg - Schulz, ''Architettura Barocca'', cit., p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; saw Baldassarre Longhena (1598–1682) as its principal exponent.&lt;ref&gt;N. Pevsner, J. Fleming, H. Honour, ''Dizionario di architettura'', cit., voce ''Longhena, Baldassarre''.&lt;/ref&gt; After the pestilence of 1630, he began the construction of the Church of Santa Maria della Salute, using a central plan. In the octagonal body of the basilica, Longhena added a sanctuary bordered on either side by two apses, similar to that adopted by [[Andrea Palladio]] in the Basilica del Santissimo Redentore; this solution strengthens the longitudinal axis of the temple, which in fact became the central body in the proper nave. The baroque style of the temple is evident in the conformation of the external mass, located along the Grand Canal: the octagonal body, covered by a large dome, is flanked by the crown of the shrine and two bell towers.

Longhena also worked within civic architecture: its [[Ca' Pesaro]] presents a seemingly conventional plan, but the play of light and shadows that are set on the richly ornate façade leads to a typically Baroque style.

In any case, the exasperation of Loghena's [[plastic arts|plastic art details]] peaked in the façade of Chiesa dell'Ospedaletto (completed in the 1670s), decorated with a fancifully and richly with atlantes, giant heads and lion masks.

===Genoa===
In Genoa, Baroque architecture, since the end of the 16th century, saw the construction of a series of large buildings that critics have deemed among the most important of the Italian landscape.&lt;ref&gt;N. Pevsner, J. Fleming, H. Honour, ''Dizionario di architettura'', cit., voce ''Italia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these was the [[Palazzo Doria Tursi]], where the planimetric configuration of the vestibule, combined with the highest indoor garden through a wide staircase, declares the presence of a movement in depth.

This solution was taken up by [[Bartolomeo Bianco]] (1590 - 1657) in what may be considered his masterpiece:&lt;ref&gt;C. Norberg - Schulz, ''Architettura Barocca'', cit., p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; the college of the Jesuits, which later became the headquarters of the [[University of Genoa]] (1634, approximately). The building has a U-shaped plan, but compared to previous one shows greater permeability between the inside and the yard; in fact, using the conformation of the very steep terrain, Bianco created a unique urban scenery, with a porch as wide as the yard and a series of overlapping arches and stairways.

'''''Konsthistorisk tidskrift''''' is a quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[academic journal]] on [[art history]] that was established in 1932 by ''Konsthistoriska sällskapet'' (the Society of Art Historians) in [[Stockholm]]. The journal was published until 1967 under the full title ''Konsthistorisk tidskrift: revy för konst och konstforskning''. Since 2002 it has carried the English alternate title ''Journal of Art History''. It was published by the [[Scandinavian University Press]] from 1992 till 1999, and has been published by [[Routledge]] ([[Taylor &amp; Francis Group]]) since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/3417286?vw=full LIBRIS entry for the ''Konsthistorisk tidskrift'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Konsthistoriska sällskapet'',  the Society of Art Historians, was founded in 1914 on the initiative of [[Osvald Sirén]], J. A. Berg Professor of Art History in Stockholm, and [[Johnny Roosval]], then docent of Art History (later professor). The society was clearly Stockholm-centric from the start: Sirén and Roosval became chairman and vice chairman, respectively. The rest of the board consisted of representatives of the major museums in Stockholm, the director of the [[Bukowskis]] auction house there, and the other universities in Lund, Uppsala and Gothenburg each having one representative ([[Ewert Wrangel]], [[August Hahr]] and [[Axel Romdahl]], respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Pettersson (2000), p. 85-86&lt;/ref&gt;

''Konsthistorisk tidskrift'' had a predecessor in the first periodical of the society, ''Konsthistoriska sällskapets publikation'', which was published 1915-1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/420689?vw=full LIBRIS entry for the ''Konsthistoriska Sällskapets Publikation'']&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926, it was absorbed into the journal ''[[Tidskrift för konstvetenskap]]'', which had been published at the [[University of Lund]] since 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/420689?vw=full LIBRIS], [http://libris.kb.se/bib/408986?vw=full LIBRIS]; Ångström-Grandien (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; At the annual meeting of Konsthistoriska sällskapet in 1931, the board of the Society proposed re-establishing a periodical of its own, as {{blockquote|despite the merits of [Tidskrift för konstvetenskap], it has become apparent that it would be more suitable for the publication of the Society to be edited from Stockholm, as most art historical authors and most members live here, and it must, additionally, be easier to satisfy the interests of art history and the art collectors in all parts of the country with Stockholm as the base.&lt;ref&gt;Sjöblom (1932), p. 123-124. Sjöberg's Swedish summary of the prospect presented by the board: "Sällskapets publikation har under senare åren utgjorts av den i Lund utgivna och redigerade Tidskrift för Konstvetenskap. Trots denna tidskrifts förtjänster har det dock visat sig vara mera lämpligt, att Sällskapets publikation redigeras från Stockholm, då de flesta konsthistoriska författarna och de flesta ledamöterna äro bosatta här, och det dessutom måste falla sig lättare att med Stockholm som utgångspunkt allsidigt tillgodose konstvetenskapens och konstsamlarnas intressen i alla delar av vårt land. Styrelsen har därför planerat en Konsthistorisk Tidskrift av ungefär samma format och omfång som den förutvarande Publikationen. Den nya tidskriften kommer att gratis tillsändas ledamöterna, och årsavgiften för ledamotskap förblir oförändrad."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The journal was to be of approximately the same size as the previous publication and would be distributed to members with no change in fees. After a short debate, the meeting agreed to the proposition of the board. Professor Axel Romdahl from Gothenburg suggested a division of the field between the two journals in some way and offered to negotiate this with representatives of the other journal.&lt;ref&gt;Sjöblom (1932), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960-1984 annual volumes of the journal included "Svensk konsthistorisk bibliografi" (from 1976 known as "konstvetenskaplig bibliografi"), an annual cumulative bibliography of art history published in Sweden, covering the years 1959-1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/3417286?vw=full LIBRIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editors==
The journal originally had an editorial group consisting of an ''ansvarig utgivare'' ("publisher", the person responsible for the publication under ''Tryckfrihetsförordningen'', the Swedish [[Constitution of Sweden#Freedom of the press and freedom of expression|Freedom of the Press Act]]) and one or several ''redaktör[er]'' ("editor[s]").&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/3417286?vw=full LIBRIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of ''ansvarig utgivare'' ("publisher") for the journal has been held by:
*[[Johnny Roosval]] (1932-1965:1/2)
*Sten Karling (1965:3/4–1973)
*Patrik Reuterswärd (1974–1990)
*Hans Henrik Brummer (1991)

The position of ''redaktör'', ("editor") for the journal has been held by:
*Georg Svensson (1932–1944)
*Kjell Boström, Aron Andersson, [[Axel Boëthius]] and Georg Svensson (1945)
*Kjell Boström, Aron Andersson and Georg Svensson (1946:1-2)

In [[physical cosmology]], the '''lepton epoch''' was the period in the evolution of the early universe in which the [[lepton]]s dominated the mass of the universe. It started roughly 1 second after the [[Big Bang]], after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the [[hadron epoch]]. During the lepton epoch the temperature of the universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang the temperature of the universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thermal history of the Universe and early growth of density fluctuations|url=http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~gamk/TUM_Lectures/Lecture4.pdf|work=Guinevere Kauffmann|publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]]|accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in [[annihilation]] reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons. The mass of the universe was then dominated by [[photon]]s as it entered the following [[photon epoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First few minutes|work=Eric Chaisson|publisher=Havard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_part3.html|accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of the Big Bang|work=The physics of the Universe|url=http://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/topics_bigbang_timeline.html|accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38077">This is a '''list of nutrition guides'''. A nutrition guide is a [[reference]] that provides [[nutrition]] advice for general [[health]], typically by dividing foods into [[food group]]s and recommending [[serving size|servings]] of each group. Nutrition guides can be presented in written or visual form, and are commonly published by [[government agency|government agencies]], [[health association]]s and [[university]] health [[academic department|departments]].

Most countries also have [[nutrition facts label]]s which are not listed here; many of those reference specific target amounts for various nutrients.

==Historical guides==

===Ancient Greece===
The [[Hippocratic Corpus]] of [[Ancient Greece]] contains one of the earliest known nutrition guides. It recommends a [[season]]al [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. For [[winter]], it advises eating a heavy diet of bread and roasted meat and fish, while avoiding vegetables and restricting liquids to, if anything, strong wine. It then recommends a lighter [[summer]] diet of soft [[barley]] cake, vegetables, boiled meat, and large quantities of diluted wine. Gradual transitions between these two diets are advised in the intervening months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hippocratic Writings|year=1983|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-044451-3|pages=272–273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KKjpaVEpP9oC|author=Various|editor1=G. E. R. Lloyd |editor2=J. Chadwick |editor3=W. N. Mann |accessdate=6 June 2011|chapter=A Regimen for Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial China===
During the [[Tang Dynasty]], [[China|Chinese]] [[physician]] [[Sun Simiao]] is believed to have written the first nutrition guide in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. In his book, ''Precious Prescriptions for Emergencies'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:備|備]][[wikt:急|急]][[wikt:千|千]][[wikt:金|金]][[wikt:要|要]][[wikt:方|方]]|p=Beiji qianjin yaofang}}), the chapter "Dietary Treatment" ({{zh|c=[[wikt:食|食]][[wikt:治|治]]|p=Shiji}}) contains sections describing the effects of eating fruits, vegetables, grains and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hsu|first=Elisabeth|title=Innovation in Chinese Medicine|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-80068-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BbYYstLfSyUC|accessdate=6 June 2011|chapter=Dietetics in Tang China and the first extant works of ''materia diatetica''|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First food pyramid===
Amid high food prices in 1972, [[Sweden]]'s [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] developed the idea of "basic foods" that were both cheap and [[nutritious]], and "supplemental foods" that added nutrition missing from the basic foods. [[Kooperativa Förbundet|KF]], a [[cooperative federation|consumer co-op]] that worked with the Board, sought to illustrate these food groups. KF developed a [[food guide pyramid|food pyramid]] because it could depict basic foods as its base, and introduced the guide to the public in 1974 in their magazine, ''[[:sv:Vi (tidning)|Vi]]''. At the base were bread, cereals, potatoes, milk, cheese and margarine; above it was a large section of supplemental [[vegetables]] and [[fruit]]; and at the top was an apex of supplemental meat, fish and eggs. The pyramid competed with the National Board's "dietary circle," which KF saw as problematic for resembling a cake divided into seven slices, and for not indicating how much of each food should be eaten. While the Board distanced itself from the pyramid, KF continued to promote it, and food pyramids were developed in other [[Scandinavia]]n countries, plus [[West Germany]], [[Japan]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The United States later developed its first food pyramid in 1992.&lt;ref name=KFPyramid&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mersmak.kf.se/Toppmeny-startsida-/KFBibliotek/Kooperativ-kronika-startsida/Sok/KF-Kronika---Visa-artikel/?articleid=641 |title=Ett provkok blev provkök |language=Swedish |date=2008-10-03 |work=KF |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325031502/http://www.mersmak.kf.se/Toppmeny-startsida-/KFBibliotek/Kooperativ-kronika-startsida/Sok/KF-Kronika---Visa-artikel/?articleid=641 |archivedate=2012-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coop.se/Globala-sidor/OmKF/Kooperativ-samverkan/Var-historia1/Tidslinjen/1960-19901/1973/KF-Provkok-lanserar-iden-om-basmat/ |title=KF Provkök lanserar idén om basmat |language=Swedish |year=1973 |work=Coop |publisher=KF |accessdate=2011-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929023533/http://www.coop.se/Globala-sidor/OmKF/Kooperativ-samverkan/Var-historia1/Tidslinjen/1960-19901/1973/KF-Provkok-lanserar-iden-om-basmat/ |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=matpyramid|url=http://www.ne.se/matpyramid|work=Nationalencyklopedin|accessdate=7 June 2011|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government guides==

===Australia===
The [[Australia]]n [[Department of Health and Ageing]] publishes '''''The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating''''', which features a wheel divided into five sections: approximately 40 percent bread, cereals, rice, pasta and noodles; 30 percent vegetables and legumes; 10 percent fruit; 10 percent milk, yogurt and cheese; and 10 percent lean meat, fish, poultry, eggs, nuts and legumes. Below the wheel are reminders to drink plenty of water and eat fats and sweets occasionally or in small amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating – Enjoy a Variety of Foods Every Day|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm|work=Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing|accessdate=3 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319033600/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm|archivedate=19 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specific recommendations are provided based on age, gender, life stage and activity level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating: Background information for consumers|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/E384CFA588B74377CA256F190004059B/$File/fd-cons.pdf|work=Australian Department of Health and Ageing|accessdate=6 June 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
The [[Austria]]n Federal Ministry of Health uses '''The Austrian Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-de|Die Österreichische Ernährungspyramide}}), which is divided into 25 blocks, each block representing a daily serving from a food group. Starting at the base, there are six servings of non-alcoholic beverages (preferably low-energy drinks like water, tea, unsweetened fruit juice and vegetable juice); three servings of vegetables and legumes; two of fruit; four of cereals, bread, pasta, rice and potatoes (preferably whole grains); three of milk and dairy (two "white," like milk, yogurt or cream cheese, and one of yellow cheese); one of fats and oil (preferably olive or canola oil); three of meat, fish, sausage and eggs (preferably fish or lean meat); and three of fatty, sweet and salty foods (though not nutritionally recommended and to be consumed rarely).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Österreichische Ernährungspyramide|url=http://www.bmg.gv.at/home/Schwerpunkte/Ernaehrung/Empfehlungen/DIE_OeSTERREICHISCHE_ERNAeHRUNGSPYRAMIDE|work=Bundesministerium für Gesundheit|accessdate=12 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
The Voedingsdriehoek is a (mostly in Flanders) widely used tool for dietitians, health educators, schools, etc. to explain a balanced diet.
The triangle is constructed as a pyramid with five different layers. The bottom layer is the largest in area, so the most important, the top is narrow and there represents little food, although it is an essential ingredient. The layers are (from top to bottom):
-	Oil / fats
-	Protein: meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, meat substitutes
-	Fruits and vegetables
-	Starch or carbohydrates (bread, potatoes, rice, pasta, etc.)
-	Drinks
In 2005 a (rather symbolically) layer was added at the bottom: sports and exercise. This is not a food, but an important part of a healthy diet and lifestyle. The information services use the "active" food pyramid.

===Brazil===
[[Brazil]]'s [[Ministry of Health (Brazil)|Ministry of Health]] publishes the '''''Food Guide''''' ({{lang-pt|Guia Alimentar}}), which features a map of Brazil depicting each of [[Regions of Brazil|Brazil's five regions]] as puzzle pieces representing a food group. However, Brazil's food recommendations differ from the map, and feature eight food groups: rice, bread, pasta, potato and cassavas (5 servings a day); vegetables and legumes (3 servings); fruits (3); milk, cheese and yogurt (3); beans (1); meat, fish and eggs (1); oils and fats (1); and sugars and sweets (no more than one).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guia Alimentar|url=http://dab.saude.gov.br/portaldab/biblioteca.php?conteudo=publicacoes/guia_alimentar2014|work=Ministério da Saúde|language=Portuguese|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{main|Canada's Food Guide}}
'''''[[Canada's Food Guide]]''''' from [[Health Canada]] is illustrated with a [[rainbow]] of four food groups: vegetables and fruit (7 to 10 servings a day for adults, depending on biological sex), grain products (6 to 8), milk and alternatives (2), and meat and alternatives (2 to 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/index-eng.php|work=Health Canada|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specific recommendations are provided based on age, gender and life stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide – A Resource for Educators and Communicators|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/pubs/res-educat/res-educat-eng.php|work=Health Canada|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada developed its first nutrition guide in 1942 as part of its [[World War II|wartime]] nutrition program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada's Food Guides from 1942 to 1992|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/context/fg_history-histoire_ga-eng.php|work=Health Canada|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[China]]'s [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Health]] uses the '''Balanced Diet [[Pagoda]]''' ({{zh|[[wikt:平|平]][[wikt:衡|衡]][[wikt:膳|膳]][[wikt:食|食]][[wikt:宝|宝]][[wikt:塔|塔]]}}), which is divided into five [[storey|stories]] ascending from largest to smallest. Cereals are at the large base; topped by vegetables and fruits; then fish, poultry, meat, eggs and other animal foods; followed by milk and soy foods; and topped with fats and oils in the small [[spire]]. Beside the pagoda are images representing water and exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Health issued "China's Dietary Guidelines (2007)"|url=http://www.gov.cn/xwfb/2008-01/15/content_858517.htm|work=The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents|url=http://www.lxzfda.gov.cn/news_view.asp?news_id=126869|work=LinXia Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324232342/http://www.lxzfda.gov.cn/news_view.asp?news_id=126869|archivedate=24 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition Dietary Pagoda|url=http://www.scmiyi.gov.cn/smpd/shjk/ysbd/12990.shtml|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805193525/http://www.scmiyi.gov.cn/smpd/shjk/ysbd/12990.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 August 2012|work=Public information network of MIYI county|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
[[Denmark]]'s Food Administration uses the '''Diet Compass''' ({{lang-da|Kostkompasset}}) to depict its "Dietary 8" ({{lang-da|8 kostråd}}) guidelines, with an image on each compass point representing a guideline. Those guidelines are: "Eat 6 fruits and vegetables a day," "Eat fish and seafood several times a week," "Eat potatoes, rice or pasta and whole wheat bread every day," "Cut back on sugar," "Cut back on greasy foods," "Eat a varied diet and maintain a normal weight," "Quench your thirst with water," and, "Be physically active at least 30 minutes a day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kostkompasset|url=http://www.altomkost.dk/Services/Materialer_og_undervisning/Kostkompasset/forside.htm|work=Fødevarestyrelsen|accessdate=12 June 2011|language=Danish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903205510/http://www.altomkost.dk/Services/Materialer_og_undervisning/Kostkompasset/forside.htm|archivedate=3 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[France]]'s [[:fr:Institut national de prévention et d'éducation pour la santé|National Institute for Prevention and Health Education]] has 25 separate food guides under the title '''The Food Guide For All''' ({{lang-fr|Le Guide Alimentaire Pour Tous}}). Each guide is based on a consumer's personality, habits and lifestyle. There are guides for people who: are health-conscious, don't care about food, prepare family meals, are poor, eat at restaurants, skip meals, don't cook, have large appetites, are on diets, prefer certain foods, avoid various foods (including meat), are sedentary, are athletic, and more. Each guide features a "portrait" in the image of a happy face designed out of foods representing that consumer's type. The portraits are billed as nutrition recommendations, though they are more decorative than informative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le guide alimentaire pour tous|url=http://www.inpes.sante.fr/espace_nutrition/guide/presentation/mode.asp|work=Institut national de prévention et d'éducation pour la santé|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
[[Germany]]'s state-funded [[:de:Aid infodienst|Aid Information Service]] uses the '''Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-de|Ernährungspyramide}}), which divides a pyramid into 22 blocks, each block representing a hand-sized serving from a food group. Starting at the base, there are six blocks for beverages, three for vegetables, two for fruit, four for grains, three for dairy, one for meat and fish, one for oils, one for fats, and one for sweets and alcohol. Beverages, vegetables, fruit and grains are marked green for "free travel"; meat and dairy are marked yellow for "caution"; and oils, fats, sweets and alcohol are marked red for "brake lights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die aid-Ernährungspyramide|url=http://www.was-wir-essen.de/gesund/empfehlungen_aid_pyramide.php|work=was-wir-essen|publisher=aid infodienst|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aid also collaborated with the German Nutrition Society to create a [[three-dimensional space|3D]] pyramid model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die dreidimensionale Lebensmittelpyramide|url=http://www.dge.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=481|work=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
[[India]]'s [[National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad|National Institute of Nutrition]] publishes the '''''Dietary Guidelines for Indians''''', which, among other diagrams, includes the Food Pyramid. The pyramid has a base of beans and legumes to eat adequately, a second layer of vegetables and fruit to eat liberally, a third layer of meat, fish, eggs and oils to eat moderately, and an apex of fatty, salty and sugary foods to eat sparingly. Accompanying the pyramid is a recommendation of regular exercise and physical activity, as well as warnings against drinking alcohol and smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Guidelines for Indians|url=http://www.ninindia.org/DietaryguidelinesforIndians-Finaldraft.pdf|work=National Institute of Nutrition|accessdate=12 June 2011|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516002639/http://www.ninindia.org/DietaryguidelinesforIndians-Finaldraft.pdf|archivedate=16 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The island of [[Ireland]]'s [[Food Safety Promotion Board]] uses '''The Food Pyramid''', which is divided into five levels: bread, cereals and potatoes at the large base (6 or more servings); then fruit and vegetables (5); followed by milk, cheese and yogurt (3); then meat, fish, eggs and alternatives (2); and finally fats, high fat/sugar snacks, foods and drinks at the apex (small amounts). At least 8 cups of water a day are also recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Food Pyramid|url=http://www.safefood.eu/en/Consumer/Healthy-Living/Eating-Well/Eating-well1/The-food-pyramid/|work=safefood|publisher=The Food Safety Promotion Board|accessdate=6 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712035747/http://www.safefood.eu/en/Consumer/Healthy-Living/Eating-Well/Eating-well1/The-food-pyramid/|archivedate=12 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
The '''Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-he|[[:he:פירמידת המזון|פירמידת המזון]]}}) from [[Israel]]'s [[Ministry of Health (Israel)|Ministry of Health]] is divided into six levels. At the wide base is water; followed by starches, including pasta, bread, corn and yams; then fruits and vegetables; then meat, fish, eggs and dairy; then fats and oils; and finally sugary foods at the small apex. Images around the pyramid represent exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Pyramid|url=http://www.health.gov.il/pages/default.asp?maincat=33&amp;catid=846|work=Ministry of Health|accessdate=6 June 2011|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
The [[Italy|Italian]] [[Ministry of Health (Italy)|Ministry of Health]] uses the '''Italian Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-it|Piramide Alimentare Italiana}}), which is divided into squares, triangles, [[trapezoid]]s and rectangles that represent one, one-half, one-and-a-half, and two servings, respectively. Beginning from the base, the divisions are: fruit (2 servings), water (1), vegetables (2), bread (1.5), biscotti (0.5), potatoes (0.5), rice and pasta (1.5), meat (1), eggs (0.5), fish (0.5), legumes (0.5), [[cold cut]] meats (0.5), milk (0.5), dairy (0.5), oils and fats (1), sweets (0.5) and wine or beer (0.5). Along the edges of the pyramid are triangles representing physical activity. The pyramid is intended to represent the variety of foods eaten over an entire week, averaged into daily portions. Also provided is an alternative, more traditional pyramid for a single day, divided into six layers representing six food groups; as well as two additional pyramids for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piramide Alimentare Italiana|url=http://www.piramidealimentare.it/|work=Istituto di Scienza dell'Alimentazione|publisher=Università di Roma|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
The '''Food Guide''' ({{lang-ja|食事バランスガイド}}), from [[Japan]]'s [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Health]] and [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|Agriculture]] ministries, is depicted as a [[top|spinning top]] with a wide upper layer tapering to a narrow bottom. At the large upper level is a [[staple food|staple meal]] of carbohydrates, including rice, bread and noodles (5 to 7 servings a day); followed below by a [[side dish]] of vegetables, potatoes, beans (except soybeans), mushrooms and seaweed (5 to 6); then a smaller [[main course]] of protein, including meat, fish, eggs and soy (3 to 5); and finally the narrow point, divided between dairy (2) and fruit (2). The top's handle is filled with "essential" water and tea, and running in circles around the handle is a figure representing moderate exercise. A small [[motion lines|motion line]] beside the top represents sweet beverages in moderation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Guide|url=http://www.maff.go.jp/j/balance_guide/|work=Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries|accessdate=3 June 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
[[Mexico]]'s Department of Nutrition and Health Promotion uses '''The Plate of Good Eating''' ({{lang-es|El Plato del Bien Comer}}), which is divided into thirds: vegetables and fruits (in equal proportion); cereals; and legumes and animal products. The guide further recommends eating "many" vegetables and fruits and "enough" cereals. The legume and animal products section is subdivided, and "few" animal products are recommended, while the guide recommends combining the larger legume section with cereals. Additional recommendations are to include each of the three food groups in each of the three main meals of the day, to eat the greatest possible variety of food, to eat according to individual needs and conditions, and to eat the least possible fats, oils, sugar and salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Plato del Bien Comer|url=http://www.fns.org.mx/index.php?IdContenido=46|work=Fomento de Nutrición y Salud|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The [[Netherlands]] Nutrition Center uses the '''Wheel of Five''' ({{lang-nl|[[:nl:Schijf van vijf|De Schijf van Vijf]]}}), which is divided into five groups: approximately 30 percent vegetables and fruit; 30 percent bread, cereals, potatoes, rice, pasta, couscous, and legumes; 16 percent dairy, meat, fish, eggs and meat substitutes; 16 percent beverages; and 8 percent fats and oils. More specific recommendations are provided based on age and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=De Schijf van Vijf|url=http://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/schijf-van-vijf/schijf.aspx|work=Het Voedingscentrum|accessdate=4 June 2011|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
[[South Korea]]'s Korean Nutrition Society uses the '''Food Bicycle''' ({{lang-ko|식품구성 자전거}}), with a small front wheel filled with water and a large rear wheel composed of approximately one-third grains; 20 percent meat, fish, eggs and beans; 20 percent vegetables; 12 percent fruits; 12 percent dairy; and 3 percent oils and sugars. A person is pedaling the bicycle, representing exercise. More specific recommendations are provided based on age, gender and life stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Koreans 2010|url=http://image.campushomepage.com/users/knsweb/ssugi513/DRIs/2010KDRIs_open_final.pdf|work=The Korean Nutrition Society|accessdate=6 June 2011|language=Korean|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2010, South Korea used a [[:ko:파일:Korean food pyramid.jpg|food pagoda model]] very similar to China's current guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of dietary reference intake publilcations|url=http://www.kns.or.kr/board.asp?catalogid=kns2008&amp;language=en&amp;boardcode=sub07_01|work=The Korean Nutrition Society|accessdate=4 June 2011|location=Select first item dated 2007.04.11 (direct link does not work)|language=English, Korean|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235113/http://www.kns.or.kr/board.asp?catalogid=kns2008&amp;language=en&amp;boardcode=sub07_01|archivedate=24 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
[[Spain]]'s Ministry of Health, Social Policy and Equality uses the '''NAOS Pyramid''' ({{lang-es|Pirámide NAOS}}), which promotes a [[Mediterranean diet]] as well as plenty of physical activity, and is drawn as a sailboat on water. It is divided into beverages and water at the base; an equal division between physical activity and a combination of grains, vegetables, tubers, fruit, olive oil and dairy in the second level, which is labeled "several times a day" and color-coded green; an equal division between sports and a combination of meat, fish, eggs, legumes and nuts in the third level, which is labeled "several times a week" and is color-coded orange; and an apex of saturated fats, sugars, salt, and sedentary activity labeled "occasionally" and color-coded red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pirámide NAOS|url=http://www.naos.aesan.mspsi.es/csym/piramide/|work=Ministerio de Sanidad, Política Social e Igualdad|publisher=Gobierno de España|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301064250/http://www.naos.aesan.mspsi.es/csym/piramide/|archivedate=1 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
[[Sweden]]'s Food Agency uses the '''Plate Model''' ({{lang-sv|Tallriksmodellen}}), which divides a plate into approximately 40 percent potatoes, rice, pasta and bread; 40 percent vegetables and fruit; and 20 percent meat, fish, eggs and legumes. People requiring more energy are allowed a larger share of carbohydrates, while people who are overweight can make up to half their plate vegetables and fruit.&lt;ref name=LVPlate/&gt;

Previously, Sweden used the Dietary Circle created in 1963, while Swedish consumer cooperative KF created the world's first food pyramid in 1974.&lt;ref name=KFPyramid/&gt;

===Switzerland===
[[Switzerland]]'s Federal Office of Public Health uses the '''Food Pyramid''' ({{lang-de|Lebensmittelpyramide}}) developed by the Swiss Society for Nutrition. At the base is 1 to 2 liters of liquids, preferably non-sugared beverages; then three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit of different colors; followed by whole grains, beans, cereals and potatoes to be eaten with each meal; then three servings of milk or dairy; one serving of meat, fish, eggs, cheese or another protein; oils, fats and nuts daily in moderation; and an apex of sweet/salty snacks and sweetened/alcoholic drinks in moderation for pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recommendations for healthy, tasty eating and drinking for adults|url=http://www.sge-ssn.ch/fileadmin/pdf/100-ernaehrungsthemen/10-gesundes_essen_trinken/Food_Pyramid.pdf|work=Swiss Society for Nutrition|accessdate=12 June 2011|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102034630/http://www.sge-ssn.ch/fileadmin/pdf/100-ernaehrungsthemen/10-gesundes_essen_trinken/Food_Pyramid.pdf|archivedate=2 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lebensmittelpyramide|url=http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/ernaehrung_bewegung/05207/05214/index.html|work=Bundesamt für Gesundheit|accessdate=12 June 2011|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928200158/http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/ernaehrung_bewegung/05207/05214/index.html|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
[[Turkey]]'s [[Ministry of Health (Turkey)|Ministry of Health]] uses the '''Basic Food Groups''' ({{lang-tr|Temel Besin Grupları}}), a four-part division of milk and dairy; meat, eggs, fish, legumes and seeds; vegetables and fruit; and bread and cereal. Each food group is accompanied by bullet points, such as serving recommendations or advice to eat more raw vegetables and whole grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temel Besin Grupları|url=http://www.beslenme.saglik.gov.tr/index.php?pid=188|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014130125/http://www.beslenme.saglik.gov.tr/index.php?pid=188|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 October 2010|work=Sağlık Bakanlığı|accessdate=12 June 2011|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Eatwell plate|Dietary Reference Values}}
[[File:Eatwell Plate.png|thumb|The Eatwell plate, as described by the United Kingdom's NHS and FSA.]]
The [[United Kingdom]]'s Department of Health published Dietary Reference Values. These are equivalent to the easier to understand [[Eatwell plate]] used by the [[National Health Service]]. This consists of roughly one-third fruit and vegetables ("at least 5 portions"); one-third bread, rice, potatoes and pasta ("plenty"); a smaller amount of milk and dairy ("some"); meat, fish, eggs and beans in the same proportion as dairy ("some"); and a small wedge of fatty and sugary foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The eatwell plate|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/eatwell-plate.aspx|work=National Health Service|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:USDA MyPlate green.svg|thumb|[[MyPlate]], from the [[United States]] [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]]]]
{{main|MyPlate|History of USDA nutrition guides}}
In the [[United States]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] uses '''[[MyPlate]]''', a plate icon divided into approximately 30 percent grains, 30 percent vegetables, 20 percent fruits and 20 percent protein, accompanied by a smaller circle representing dairy. Additional recommendations include to enjoy food but eat less, avoid oversized portions, make at least half of grains [[whole grain|whole]], switch to fat-free or low-fat milk, choose foods with less sodium, and drink water instead of sugary drinks.

Previous USDA food guides include the [[History of USDA nutrition guides#Basic 7|Basic 7]] (1943–1956), the [[History of USDA nutrition guides#Basic Four|Basic Four]] (1956–1992), the [[Food Guide Pyramid]] (1992–2005), and [[MyPyramid]] (2005–2011).

The [[National Institutes of Health]] uses the Dietary Approaches to Stop [[Hypertension]] ('''DASH''') '''Eating Plan''' for people seeking to lower their [[blood pressure]]. DASH differs from MyPlate in that the protein category is replaced by a smaller proportion of lean meats, [[poultry]], and [[fish (food)|fish]]; there are separate sections for fats and [[vegetable fats and oils|oils]], legumes, and [[confectionery|sweets]]; and fruits and vegetables don't constitute half of the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthier Eating with DASH|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/hbp/prevent/h_eating/h_e_dash.htm|work=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=3 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716051126/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/hbp/prevent/h_eating/h_e_dash.htm|archivedate=16 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is the DASH Eating Plan?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/dash/dash_what.html|work=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion]] in the USDA and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] jointly release a longer textual document called ''[[Dietary Guidelines for Americans]]'', updated in 2015 with the next scheduled revision in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/dietaryguidelines.htm|title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dietary Reference Intake]] values are published by the [[Institute of Medicine]] for general use, but [[nutrition facts label]]s in the U.S. use the older [[Reference Daily Intake]] standards instead.

===World Health Organization===
The [[World Health Organization]] uses '''The 3 Fives''', a guide featuring five key points in each of three categories. The three categories are safer food, a healthy diet, and appropriate physical activity. In the healthy diet category, the five keys are: "Give your baby only breast milk for the first 6 months of life," "Eat a variety of food," "Eat plenty of vegetables and fruit," "Eat moderate amounts of fats and oil," and "Eat less salt and sugar." Each key includes bullet points with further recommendations. The 3 Fives was originally developed for distribution at major sporting events like the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] and the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], but it can also be used for general audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 3 Fives|url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/consumer/3_fives_Beijing/en/index.html|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=3 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609134315/http://www.who.int/foodsafety/consumer/3_fives_Beijing/en/index.html|archivedate=9 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before The 3 Fives, the WHO used the CINDI dietary guide, which included the CINDI pyramid. The guide was intended to help European health professionals and policymakers develop their own national nutrition guides. The pyramid has a large green base representing approximately two-thirds of the triangle's area, which is filled with vegetables, fruits, grains and starches. A middle layer shaded orange for "caution" is divided into two equal sections: low-fat milk and dairy; and beans, lentils, legumes, fish, eggs, poultry and lean meat. At the top is a small "red zone" of fats and sweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CINDI dietary guide|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/119926/E70041.pdf|work=WHO Regional Office for Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)===
FAO provides technical assistance to countries for developing, revising and implementing food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) and food guides in line with current scientific evidence. FAO also carries out periodic reviews on progress made in the development and use of dietary guidelines. FAO's food based dietary guidelines website collects more than 80 national guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food-based dietary guidelines|url=http://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-dietary-guidelines/home/en/|work=Food and Agriculture Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other guides==
*The [[American Diabetes Association]] uses the '''Create Your Plate''' system, which divides a plate into three sections: non-starchy vegetables (the largest section), starchy foods, and meat or meat substitutes. Like [[MyPlate]], the ADA complements its plate with a glass of low-fat or nonfat milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Create Your Plate|url=http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/planning-meals/create-your-plate/|work=American Diabetes Association|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Germany|German]] Nutrition Society ({{lang-de|[[:de:Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung|Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung]]}}) publishes the '''Food Circle''' ({{lang-de|Ernährungskreis}}), which is divided into 30 percent cereals and potatoes; 26 percent vegetables and salad; 17 percent fruit; 18 percent milk and dairy; 7 percent meat, sausage, fish and eggs; and 2 percent fats and oils. Beverages, represented by a glass of water, are placed in the interior of the circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eine runde Sache: Der neue DGE-Ernährungskreis|url=http://www.dge.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=219|work=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der neue DGE-Ernährungskreis|url=http://www.dge.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=413|work=Der neue DGE-Ernährungskreis|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German|date=1 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Harvard School of Public Health]] uses the '''[[Healthy eating pyramid|Healthy Eating Pyramid]]''', which is split into nine sections, including a base of daily exercise and weight control. Compared to MyPlate, grains become whole grains, with refined grains in a "use sparingly" category; protein is split between "fish, poultry and [[egg (food)|eggs]]" and "[[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[Seed#Edible seeds|seeds]], [[bean]]s and [[tofu]]" with [[red meat]] and processed meat in a "use sparingly" category; healthy fats and oils have their own section; and dairy can be substituted with calcium and vitamin D [[dietary supplement|supplements]]. To the side of the pyramid are [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] in moderation and a daily [[multivitamin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Eating Pyramid|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/pyramid/|work=University of Michigan Health System|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Massachusetts]] Department of Health and Human Services uses the '''Plate Method''', which shows a plate that is one-half fruits and vegetables, one-quarter grains and starches, and one-quarter meat and protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use the Plate Method|url=http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eohhs2terminal&amp;L=5&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Consumer&amp;L2=Prevention+and+Wellness&amp;L3=Healthy+Living&amp;L4=Eat+Better&amp;sid=Eeohhs2&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=dph_mass_in_motion_eat_better_plate_method&amp;csid=Eeohhs2|work=Massachusetts Health and Human Services|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Overall Nutritional Quality Index]]
*The [[Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine]] uses the '''Power Plate''', which promotes a [[vegan]] diet and is divided into equal parts fruit, grains, [[legume]]s and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Plate|url=http://www.pcrm.org/health/powerplate/|work=Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[University of Michigan]] Health System uses the '''Healing Foods Pyramid''', which consists of 11 sections, including a base of [[drinking water|water]]. Compared to MyPlate, it adds sections for legumes, [[seasoning]]s, healthy fats, and eggs. Lean meats are in a weekly category, as are fish and [[seafood]]. An optional category includes alcohol, [[tea]] and [[Types of chocolate#Classification|dark chocolate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healing Foods Pyramid 2010|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/umim/food-pyramid|work=University of Michigan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605000847/http://www.med.umich.edu/umim/food-pyramid/|archivedate=2011-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [LiveWell for LIFE] project uses '''National Plates''' to show the ideal composition of diets in various EU countries that are both healthy, environmentally sustainable and affordable. This concept was pioneered by WWF in the UK and is now  financially supported by the  European Commission under the LIFE Plus programme(see [[Sustainable diet]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LiveWell Plate|url=http://www.livewellforlife.eu/|work=LiveWell for LIFE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Media_pluralism_trends_2018.jpg|thumb|436x436px|Media pluralism trends 2018, UNESCO's World Trends Report]]
Media pluralism is often recognized by [[International organization|international organizations]] and [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations]] as being an essential part of a [[Democracy|democratic]] state, [[Reporters Without Borders]] considers ''"access to a plurality of editorial lines and analyses [as] essential for citizens to be able to confront ideas, to make their own informed choices and to conduct their life freely"''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Expanded access to the [[Internet]] and the [[Digital television transition|digital switch-over]] has enabled an increased availability of [[Content (media)|media content]], largely through sharing and [[user-generated content]] on [[social media]], in addition to the digital channels to which individuals have access across television and radio. The diversity of content is however accompanied by what [[Comparing Media Systems|Hallin and Mancini]] call polarized pluralism in a media system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics|last=Hallin|first=Daniel C.|last2=Mancini|first2=Paolo|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0521543088|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to the [[World Trends Report]], a sharper division in the way we use news is coming up due to the interaction between consumption habits, changing [[Economic model|economic models]] and technical systems. This signifies that even if multiple kinds of information and programming are available, each segmented group may only ingest one branch of the whole. The increase of Internet penetration and reliance on online sources for news is thought of to producing siloed debates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

At the [[Infrastructure|infrastructural]] level, ‘[[Zero-rating|zero rating]]’— in which Internet or [[Mobile network operator|mobile service providers]] allow users to access specific content or applications without counting towards the user’s data ‘cap’— expands in parallel to mobile uptakes, particularly in [[Emerging markets|emerging countries]]. Traditional business models for the news media continue to be disrupted, leading to vertical and horizontal concentration and introduction of new types of ownership. Challenges to media funding introduce new types of economic models such as [[Paywall|pay-walls]] and [[Crowdfunding|crowd-funding]] initiatives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Gender equality|Gender]] is a part of media pluralism and is characterized by the under-representation of [[Women in media|women in the media]] workforce, in [[decision-making]] and in media content. People with disabilities are also under-represented in the media system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/resources/disability-and-the-media.html|title=Disability and the Media {{!}} United Nations Enable|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Understanding media pluralism ==

* Pluralism means choice for media consumption and production, as distinct from monopolization of offerings and opportunities.
* Pluralism involves sensitivity to a variety of economic ownership models and a technical architecture of delivery in which multichannel and multi-platform distribution is available.
* Pluralism often resonates with strong commitments on behalf of governments to public service and community media to provide for diversity.

== Access ==
{{Main|Access to information}}Access to information, as the ability for an individual to seek, receive and impart information effectively, is an aspect of media pluralism. It can include or allow "scientific, [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]], and traditional knowledge; freedom of information, building of open knowledge resources, including open Internet and open standards, and open access and availability of data; preservation of digital heritage; respect for cultural and linguistic diversity, such as fostering access to local content in accessible languages; quality education for all, including lifelong and [[Educational technology|e-learning]]; diffusion of new media and information [[literacy]] and skills, and social inclusion online, including addressing inequalities based on skills, education, gender, age, race, ethnicity, and accessibility by those with disabilities; and the development of connectivity and affordable ICTs, including mobile, the Internet, and broadband infrastructures".&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232563E.pdf|title=Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=261065&amp;set=005B054385_2_76&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Buckland defines six types of barriers that have to be overcome in order for access to information to be achieved: identification of the source, availability of the source, price of the user, cost to the provider, cognitive access, acceptability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/access.html|title=Access to information.|website=people.ischool.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While “[[access to information]]”, “right to information”, “right to know” and “freedom of information” are sometimes used as synonyms, the diverse terminology does highlight particular (albeit related) dimensions of the issue.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Internet and mobile ===
According to the World Trends Report, access to all types of media has increased between 2012 and 2017, but this is especially true for access to the Internet. International commitments such as the [[Sustainable Development Goals|UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]], the work of the [[Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development]] and the [[Internet Governance Forum]]’s intersessional work on ‘Connecting the Next Billion’ testify of this.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), by the end of 2017, an estimated 48 per cent of individuals regularly connect to the internet, up from 34 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 2017a.

Available at https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/publications/wtid.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the significant increase in absolute numbers, however, in the same period the annual growth rate of Internet users has slowed down, with five per cent annual growth in 2017, dropping from a 10 per cent growth rate in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 2017b.

==== Limitations ====
[[File:Number_of_mobile_cellular_subscriptions_2012-2016.svg|thumb|344x344px|Number of mobile cellular subscriptions 2012-2016]]
[[Mobile Web|Mobile Internet]] connectivity has an impact in expanding access. The number of unique mobile cellular subscriptions increased from 3.89 billion in 2012 to 4.83 billion in 2016, two-thirds of the world’s population, with more than half of subscriptions located in [[Asia-Pacific|Asia and the Pacific]]. The number of subscriptions is predicted to rise to 5.69 billion users in 2020. As of 2016, almost 60 per cent of the world’s population had access to a 4G broadband cellular network, up from almost 50 per cent in 2015 and 11 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;GSMA. 2017. The Mobile Economy 2017. Available at https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the open web affords explorations beyond a user’s immediate range of interests, Mobile Internet has the singularity of creating siloed information spaces predisposing mobile users to access only a limited portion of the available information. [[Censorship]] and [[surveillance]] are also factors of media pluralism as they cause different experiences for users accessing the Internet in different States.

==== Zero-rating ====
The limits that users face on accessing information via mobile applications coincide with a broader process of fragmentation of the Internet. [[Zero-rating]], the practice of internet providers allowing users free connectivity to access specific content or applications for free, has offered some opportunities for individuals to surmount economic hurdles, but has also been accused by its critics as creating a ‘two-tiered’ internet. To address the issues with zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of ‘equal rating’ and is being tested in experiments by [[Mozilla]] and [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] in Africa. Equal rating prevents prioritization of one type of content and zero-rates all content up to a specified data cap. Some countries in the region had a handful of plans to choose from (across all mobile network operators) while others, such as [[Colombia]], offered as many as 30 pre-paid and 34 post-paid plans.&lt;ref&gt;Galpaya, Helani. 2017. Zero-rating in Emerging Economies. London: Chatham House. Available at https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/documents/GCIG%20 no.47_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study led by the [[Alliance for Affordable Internet]] (A4AI) of eight countries in the [[Global South]] found that zero-rated data plans exist in every country, although there is a great range in the frequency with which they are offered and actually used in each.&lt;ref&gt;Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI). 2015. Models of Mobile Data Services in Developing Countries. Research brief. The Impacts of Emerging Mobile Data Services in Developing Countries. Available at http://a4ai.org/the-impacts-of-emerging-mobile-data-services-in-developing-countries/ The study looked at the top three to five carriers by market share in Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Peru and Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the 181 plans examined, 13 per cent were offering zero-rated services. Another study, covering [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[South Africa]], found Facebook’s Free Basics and [[Wikipedia Zero]] to be the most commonly zero-rated content.&lt;ref&gt;Gillwald, Alison, Chenai Chair, Ariel Futter, Kweku Koranteng, Fola Odufuwa, and John Walubengo. 2016.

=== Broadcast media ===
[[File:Main_source_of_news_by_age.svg|thumb|248x248px|Main source of news by age]]
In Western Europe and North America, the primacy of [[television]] as a main source of information is being challenged by the internet, while in other regions, such as Africa, television is gaining greater audience share than [[radio]], which has historically been the most widely accessed media platform.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In the Arab region, geopolitical interests has contributed to the growing reach of state-owned global news broadcasters and has determined the launching of Arabic-language channels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Generational trends ====
Age plays a profound role in determining the balance between radio, television and the Internet as the leading source of news. According to the 2017 [[Reuters]] Institute Digital News Report, in 36 countries and territories surveyed, 51 per cent of adults 55 years and older consider television as their main news source, compared to only 24 per cent of respondents between 18 and 24.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Newman, Nic, Richard Fletcher, Antonis Kalogeropoulos, David A. L. Levy, and Rasmus Kleis Nielsen. 2017. Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2017. Oxford: Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Available at https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Digital%20News%20Report%202017%20 web_0.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern is reversed when it comes to [[Digital media|online media]], chosen by 64 per cent of users between 18 and 24 as their primary source, but only by 28 per cent of users 55 and older.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  According to the Arab Youth Survey, in 2016, 45 per cent of the young people interviewed considered social media as a major source of news.&lt;ref&gt;ASDA’A Burson-Marsteller. 2016. Arab Youth Survey Middle East – Findings. Available at http://www.arabyouthsurvey.com/. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Digital transition ====
{{See also|Digital television transition}}Digital transition is the process in which older [[Analog TV|analog television]] [[broadcasting]] is converted to and replaced by [[digital television]].The [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) has been mapping the progress in [[Digital television transition|digital switchovers]] across the globe. According to them, the switch from [[Analog television|analogue television]] to [[digital television]] has been completed in 56 countries in 2017, and was ongoing in 68, steadily increasing the range of channels to which individuals have access.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 2017b.

[[File:Status_of_the_transition_to_Digital_Terrestrial_Television_Broadcasting.svg|thumb|275x275px|Status of the transition to Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting]]

==== Expansion strategies ====

* Satellite television has continued to add global or transnational alternatives to national viewing options for many audiences. Global news providers such as the [[BBC News|BBC]], [[Al Jazeera]], [[Agence France-Presse]], [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (formerly Russia Today) and the Spanish-language [[EFE|Agencia EFE]], have used the internet and satellite television to better reach audiences across borders and have added specialist broadcasts to target specific foreign audiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Reflecting a more outward looking orientation, [[China]] [[Global Television Network]] (CGTN), the multi-language and multi-channel grouping owned and operated by [[China Central Television]], changed its name from CCTV-NEWS in January 2017.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* After years of budget cuts and shrinking global operations, in 2016 BBC announced the launch of 12 new language services (in [[Oromo language|Afaan Oromo]], [[Amharic]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Pidgin]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]), branded as a component of its biggest expansion ‘since the 1940s’.&lt;ref&gt;BBC. 2016. BBC World Service announces biggest expansion ‘since the 1940s’. BBC News, sec. Entertainment &amp; Arts. Available at https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainmentarts-37990220. Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also expanding access to content are changes in usage patterns with non-linear viewing, as [[Streaming media|online streaming]] is becoming an important component of users’ experience. Since expanding its global service to 130 new countries in January 2016, [[Netflix]] experienced a surge in subscribers, surpassing 100 million subscribers in the second quarter of 2017, up from 40 million in 2012. The audience has also become more diverse with 47 per cent of users based outside of the [[United States]], where the company began in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Huddleston, Tom. 2017. Netflix Has More U.S. Subscribers Than Cable TV. Fortune. Available at http://fortune.com/2017/06/15/netflix-more-subscribersthan-cable/. Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newspaper industry ===
The [[Internet]] has challenged the press as an alternative source of information and opinion but has also provided a new platform for newspaper organizations to reach new audiences. Between 2012 and 2016, print newspaper circulation continued to fall in almost all regions, with the exception of Asia and the Pacific, where the dramatic increase in sales in a few select countries has offset falls in historically strong Asian markets such as [[Japan]] and the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]]. Between 2012 and 2016, [[India]]’s print circulation grew by 89 per cent.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Campbell, Cecilia. 2017. World Press Trends 2017. Frankfurt: WAN-IFRA.&lt;/ref&gt; As many newspapers make the transition to online platforms, revenues from digital subscriptions and [[Online advertising|digital advertising]] have been growing significantly. How to capture more of this growth remains a pressing challenge for newspapers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Advertising issues ====
Print media is continuously affected by changing trends in advertising: in 2012 its share of total news media revenues globally dropped below 50 per cent and continued falling to 38 per cent in 2016. Newspapers transition to online platforms increase the volume of revenues from digital subscriptions and [[Online advertising|digital advertising]]. The main challenge that [[Newspaper|newspapers]] face, according to Cecilia Campbell, is how to capture more of the digital subscriptions and advertising growth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Economic models ==
Media systems are built from a variety of economic models including mixes of [[Market economy|market]], [[public service]], [[community]] and [[State-owned enterprise|state entities]]. A plurality of media owners and economic models serves as an essential element of external pluralism, guaranteed by competition in the market. Nonprofit public service and [[community media]] can help achieve internal pluralism by incorporating social and [[cultural diversity]] in the content they produce. Community media, drawing especially on volunteers, can be a unique source of local dialogue and [[information exchange]]. The lack of adaption and of efficient economic strategies from [[Old media|traditional media]] has led to proliferation of privately owned media. This involves a diversification of newspapers but may also affects quality journalism and [[media independence]], especially with the financial contributions from "backers".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Pluralism in media ownership ===

==== State-owned media ====
In 2012, the [[Arab States Broadcasting Union]] (ASBU) counted 1,230 television stations broadcasting via Arab and international satellites, of which 133 were state-owned and 1,097 private.&lt;ref&gt;Arab States Broadcasting Union. 2015. Arab Satellite Broadcasting Annual Report 2015. Available at http://www.asbu.net/medias/NewMedia_2016/text/asbu_report_2015.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of [[government]] owned channels in the media sector is paralleled by a growth in outlets with a [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] agenda. In some countries, private media outlets often maintain close ties to governments or individual politicians , while media houses owned by politically non-aligned individuals have struggled to survive, often in the face of advertising boycotts by state agencies. According to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), public service broadcasting tend to struggle with fundings and to decline since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;European Broadcasting Union (EBU). 2015. Funding of Public Service Media 2015. Available at https://www.ebu.ch/publications/funding-of-public-service-med-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Controlled liberalization ====
Media [[privatization]] and the lessening of the State dominance over media content is a global trend, according to the [[World Trends Report]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Establishing profitable models of [[State ownership|state-owned]] but relatively independent papers is part of the controlled liberalization process and is a common practice in the [[Asia-Pacific|Asia Pacific]] region.
* State owned papers are top selling in Africa and the Arab region but often lack in reflecting society's plurality.
* [[Vertical integration]] and concentration in [[Mature market|mature markets]] are found in Central and Eastern Europe, but they tend to lack [[Transparency (market)|transparency]] on ownership and of institutional safeguards with regard to pluralism (e.g. monitoring of concentration and regulatory intervention).
* Limits to [[Concentration of media ownership|concentration]] are clearly set out in Western Europe but they face [[Lobbying|lobbies]] from media actors who are able to loosen norms and the enforcement of the law.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== New types of cross-ownership ====
{{See also|Cross ownership}}[[Cross ownership|Cross-ownership]] is a method of reinforcing business relationships by owning stock in the companies with which a given company does business. Drawing the line between the media and other industries is a challenge for new types of cross-ownership. The acquisition of the [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] by the founder of online retailer [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] raised concerns about the newspaper independence, the newspaper has significantly increased its standing in the [[Digital media|online media]]—and print—and introduced significant innovations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Community-centered media ownership model ====
Most common in isolated, rural or disadvantaged areas [[Community media|community-centered media]] ownership is also mostly pertaining to radio. Through this model, not-for-profit media outlets are run and managed by the communities. They are also characterized as "independent and governed by and in the service of the communities they serve"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/community-media-sustainability/policy-series/defining|title=Community media sustainability|last=|first=|date=2017-04-07|website=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represent what UNESCO calls &lt;ref&gt;Steve Buckley, 2011, Community Media: A Good Practice Handbook.

=== Advertising, between old and new models ===
[[File:Internet_advertising_revenue_2012-2016.svg|thumb|286x286px|Internet advertising revenue 2012-2016]]
One of the challenges to [[Old media|traditional media]] is [[Advertising|advertisement]], which has evolved since 2010. According to the World Trends Report&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, between 2012 and 2016, revenues from advertisement in print have decreased by 27 percent In 2012, print advertising’s share of total news advertising revenue was 48 per cent, falling to 38 per cent by 2016.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Circulation of [[Digital newspaper|digital versions of traditional newspapers]] and digital advertisements have grown significantly, but have not been sufficient to offset losses in print. Once the transitioning phase from old media to digital media is over, revenues from digital advertisement tend to increase.&lt;ref&gt;PwC. 2017. IAB internet advertising revenue report 2016 full year results. Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). The trend captured by the study of the Internet Advertising Bureau is limited to the USA, where the largest multinational companies  that are responsible for transformations in digital advertisement are headquartered&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon pushed advertisers to pay premium prices to quality publications.

Tauel Harper considers that with the rise of [[big data]], media have been seen to lose the "advertising [[subsidy]]" for journalistic content, through which "private" advertising paid for "[[Civic journalism|public journalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Tauel. 2016.

=== New platforms and business models ===
The [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in the [[United States]], or the [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] in [[South Africa]] use extensions or variations of existing schemes such as pay-walls created by publications considered to be of particularly high quality or addressing a particular niche.

The [[The Guardian|Guardian]] uses [[Wikipedia]]'s borrowed strategy of frequently asking readers for [[Donation|donations]] in support to quality journalism or [[free content]].

In various sectors, the number of [[Crowdfunded Journalism|crowdfunded journalism]] projects has increased significantly. While in 2012, 88 projects received funding through the platform, in 2015, the number of projects rose to 173, scattered across 60 countries (even if North America continues to register the majority of funded projects). The funds collected grew from $1.1 million in 2012 to $1.9 million in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, Nancy, and Amy Mitchell. 2016. Crowdfunded Journalism: A Small but Growing Addition to Publicly Driven Journalism. Available at http://www.journalism.org/2016/01/20/crowdfunded-journalism/. Accessed 23 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Share_of_Internet_advertising_revenue_by_platform_2012-2016.svg|thumb|284x284px|Share of Internet advertising revenue by platform 2012-2016]]
Economic models also depend on larger structural reconfiguration of the market. While in 2012 advertising revenues from [[Mobile advertising|mobile]] represented a tiny portion of the market in the [[United States]], in 2016 they surpassed revenues from all other platforms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Media actors have also started testing new formats and technologies of journalism, experimenting with how [[virtual reality]] or [[Video game journalism|gaming]] can facilitate immersive experiences of relatively distant events. In 2015 for example, the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] opened its Virtual Reality Lab, seeking to provide original perspectives on issues ranging from the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], to the [[South Sudanese Civil War|conflict in South Sudan]], to the thinning of the [[Antarctica|ice cap in Antarctica]].

== Content ==
According to [[Cisco Systems]], in 2016 an average of 96,000 [[Petabyte|petabytes]] was transferred monthly over the Internet, more than twice as many as in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Cisco Systems. 201.

Total number of websites.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== User-generated content ===
Reaching two billion daily active users in June 2017, [[Facebook]] has emerged as the most popular social media platform globally.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters. 2017. Mark Zuckerberg Says Facebook Now Has 2 Billion Users Worldwide. Fortune. Available at http://fortune.com/2017/06/27/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-userbase/. Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Other social media platforms are also dominant at the regional level such as: [[Twitter]] in [[Japan]], [[Naver]] in the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], [[Instagram]] (owned by Facebook) and [[LinkedIn]] (owned by [[Microsoft]]) in [[Africa]], [[VKontakte]] (VK) and [[Odnoklassniki]] in [[Russia]] and other countries in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], [[WeChat]] and [[Tencent QQ|QQ]] in [[China]].

However, a concentration phenomenon is occurring globally giving the dominance to a few online platforms that become popular for some unique features they provide, most commonly for the added privacy they offer users through disappearing messages or [[end-to-end encryption]] (e.g. [[WhatsApp]], [[Snapchat]], [[Signal (software)|Signal]], and [[Telegram (service)|Telegram]]), but they have tended to occupy niches and to facilitate the exchanges of information that remain rather invisible to larger audiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Production of freely accessible information has been increasing since 2012. In January 2017, [[Wikipedia]] had more than 43 million articles, almost twice as many as in January 2012. This corresponded to a progressive diversification of content and increase in contributions in languages other than English. In 2017, less than 12 per cent of Wikipedia content was in English, down from 18 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Wikimedia Foundation. 2017. Wikipedia Statistics. Available at https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Graham, Straumann, and Hogan say that increase in the availability and diversity of content has not radically changed the structures and processes for the production of knowledge. For example, while content on Africa has dramatically increased, a significant portion of this content has continued to be produced by contributors operating from North America and Europe, rather than from Africa itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Divisions of Labor and Informational Magnetism: Mapping Participation in Wikipedia.|last=Graham|first=Mark|last2=Staumann|first2=Ralph K.|last3=Hogan|first3=Bernie|publisher=Annals of the Association of American Geographers 105 (6): 1158–1178.|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Algorithms, echo chambers and polarization ===
The proliferation of online sources represents a vector leading to an increase in pluralism but [[Algorithm|algorithms]] used by [[Social networking service|social networking platforms]] and [[Web search engine|search engines]] to provide users with a personalized experience based on their individual preferences represent a challenge to pluralism, restricting exposure to differing viewpoints and news feed. This is commonly referred to as "eco-chambers" and "[[Filter bubble|filter-bubbles]]".

With the help of algorithms, filter bubbles influence users choices and perception of reality by giving the impression that a particular point of view or representation is widely shared. Following the 2016 [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum of membership of the European Union in the United Kingdom]] and the [[United States presidential election|United States presidential elections]], this gained attention as many individuals confessed their surprise at results that seemed very distant from their expectations. The range of pluralism is influenced by the personalized individualization of the services and the way it diminishes choice.

The term "[[fake news]]" gained importance with the electoral context in Western Europe and North America. It is determined by [[Fraud|fraudulent]] content in news format and its velocity. According to Bounegru, Gray, Venturini and Mauri, fake news is when a deliberate lie "is picked up by dozens of other [[Blog|blogs]], retransmitted by hundreds of websites, cross-posted over thousands of social media accounts and read by hundreds of thousands" that it then effectively becomes "fake news".&lt;ref&gt;Bounegru, Liliana, Jonathan Gray, Tommaso Venturini, and Michele Mauri. 2017.

=== Marginalized groups ===
The media covering of [[Social exclusion|marginalized groups]] such as refugees tend to be influenced by and influence the political and social perceptions. While a large proportion of the European press initially articulated a sympathetic and empathetic response towards the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict in [[Syria]], according to Georgiou and Zaborowski, this sentiment was gradually replaced by suspicion and, in some cases, hostility towards [[Refugee|refugees]] and migrants.&lt;ref&gt;Georgiou, Myria, and Rafal Zaborowski. 2016. Media coverage of the “refugee crisis”: A cross-European perspective. London: London School of Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the quality and [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid press]] tended to employ ‘established, stereotyped narratives’ of security threats and economic costs.&lt;ref&gt;Greussing, Esther, and Hajo G.

=== News players ===
[[Gatekeeping (communication)|Gate-keeping]] mechanisms continue to influence not only what is being communicated, but also who is given the opportunity to frame events. Citizens’ voices have indeed increased in new stories, individuals included in these stories tend to be treated, not as agents capable of asserting their world views and their interpretation of events, but rather as [[Vox populi|vox-pol]], employed to add color to a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;van der Meer, Toni G.L.A., Piet Verhoeven, Johannes W.J. Beentjes, and Rens Vliegenthart. 2016. Disrupting gatekeeping practices: Journalists’ source selection in times of crisis. Journalism 18 (9): 1107-1124&lt;/ref&gt; Harlow and Johnson consider that in the case of protests, demonstrations or conflicts, established institutions and elites tend to prevail as news sources.&lt;ref&gt;Harlow, Summer, and Thomas J. Johnson. 2011. The Arab Spring| Overthrowing the Protest Paradigm? How The New York Times, Global Voices and Twitter Covered the Egyptian Revolution. International journal of Communication 5: 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Although novel media operations and actors have had a smaller impact on mainstream reporting, they have been instrumental in animating intermediate spaces, which aggregate content in ways that can reach broader audiences.

As users increasingly move from broadcast to online media to access information, the same large media institutions tend to predominate online spaces, even if filtered and mediated in much of their social media presence. A decade later, the majority of the most visited and viewed news websites remain traditional media outlets ([[CNN]], New York Times, the Guardian, [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]], [[BBC News|BBC]]), although news aggregation websites such as [[Reddit]] and [[Google News]] have emerged among the top five sites with the highest [[web traffic]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexa. 2017.

=== Media and information literacy ===
Authors Frau-Meigs, Velez, and Michel (2017) and Frau-Meigs and Torrent (2009) consider diversity in media can also be enhanced by [[Information and media literacy|media and information literacy]] (MIL).&lt;ref&gt;Frau-Meigs, Divina, and Jordi Torrent. 2009. Mapping media education policies in the world: visions, programmes and challenges. Revista Comunicar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frau-Meigs, Divina, Irma Velez, and Julieta Flores Michel. 2017.

Accessed 22 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that it can be useful in understanding the consequences of algorithms on modes of diffusion. Many types of MIL exist from [[information literacy]], [[media literacy]], news literacy, advertising literacy, [[digital literacy]], media education, to digital and media literacy. A few initiatives already exist in the field:

* UNESCO launched in 2013 the Global Alliance for Partnerships on Media and Information Literacy (GAPMIL), as an "effort to promote international cooperation to ensure that all citizens have access to media and information competencies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/media-development/media-literacy/global-alliance-for-partnerships-on-media-and-information-literacy/about-gapmil/|title=About GAPMIL - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The recent annual yearbook by the [[The International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media|International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media]] focuses on trends and opportunities for MIL in the [[Arab world|Arab region]].
* There have also been efforts to embed media and information literacy initiatives and requirements into legislation in countries such as [[Serbia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/five-serbian-ministries-government-joined-forces-enable-media-and-information-literacy-policies|title=Five Serbian Ministries Government Joined Forces to Enable Media and Information Literacy Policies|last=|first=|date=2017-03-16|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Finland]]&lt;ref&gt;Finnish Media Education.

* Education initiatives have been proliferating online reflecting a growth of [[Massive open online course|MOOCs]] or massive online courses. Available on platforms such as [[Coursera]] and [[edX]], as well as by [[Public broadcasting|public service broadcasters]], these courses target both students and consumers of media, as well as teachers.
* There have also been a growing number of initiatives launched by internet companies to combat [[online hate speech]] or the proliferation of ‘fake news’, largely built on users’ inputs and support in flagging content that appears to not comply with a platform’s [[terms of service]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanford History Education Group. 2016.

Tuchman, Daniels, and Benoit (1978) use the term "[[symbolic annihilation]]" (originally credited to [[George Gerbner]]) to describe women's relationship to and visibility in [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, Gaye, A.K. Daniels, and J Benoit. 1978. Hearth and Home: Images of Women the Mass Media. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]], women’s visibility in newspaper, television and radio increased by only seven percentage points between 1995 (17 per cent) and 2015 (24 per cent).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who Makes the News?

[[Regional organization|Regional]] and [[International organization|international organizations]] also recognize gender and media pluralism as often being problematic:

* In 2010, [[UNESCO]] developed a comprehensive set of Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media, aimed at encouraging media organizations to benchmark themselves against equality criteria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* In 2013, the Council of the [[European Parliament]] adopted the recommendation made by the European Institute for Gender Equality, that the media industry should adopt and implement gender equality indicators relating to women in decision-making, gender equality policies and women on boards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* In 2016, [[UN Women]] launched a new partnership with major media organizations to draw attention to and act on eradicating all forms of inequalities. The Step it Up for Gender Equality Media Compact comprises a coalition of media outlets from around the globe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The media workforce ===
According to Byerly, in many countries, as many women as men are graduating from media, journalism and communication degree programmes and entering the industry.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Byerly, Carolyn M. 2011. Global Report on Status of Women in News Media. Washington D. C.: intercultural dialogue. Nordicom. Available at http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A769151&amp;dswid=-8862. Accessed 22 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, when the first substantial analysis of [[Women in media|women media]] professionals across 43 nations was produced, women constituted around 40 per cent of the media workforce.&lt;ref&gt;National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch). 1995. Global Media Monitoring Project: Women’s Participation in the News. National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch).&lt;/ref&gt; A [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]] (GMMP) 2015 report found that 31 per cent of stories on politics and 39 per cent of stories about the economy have female by-lines.&lt;ref&gt;The Global Media Monitoring Project is the longest-running longitudinal and global study of gender and news media and provides a snapshot of how women and men feature in, make and report the news on one day every five years. The first GMMP report was in 1995 and the most recent one (in 2015) published its findings in November 2015. The Project provides comparative data across time and region. Teams in 114 countries who monitored 22,136 stories published, broadcast or tweeted by 2,030 distinct media outlets carried out the 2015 report. In sum, data were collected on the work of 26,010 journalists and the representation of 45,402 individuals who featured in or were quoted in the stories.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the US, Harp, Bachmann, and Loke, show that while women journalists are writing on a wider range of topics, they are still a minority of columnist at the major dailies.&lt;ref&gt;Harp, Dustin, Ingrid Bachmann, and Jaime Loke. 2014. Where are the women? The presence of female columnists in US opinion pages. Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly 91 (2): 289–307.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of presenting on broadcast news, the 2015 GMMP found that the global proportion of women was 49 per cent, the same as in 2000 and two percentage points below the 1995 finding. Since 2005, the number of women working as reporters in broadcast news has dropped by four percentage points in television and radio.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Closer analysis shows that women were more numerous on television (57 per cent), for example, and less numerous on radio (41 per cent), where ‘looks’ are obviously far less important. The majority of younger presenters were women, but that trend reversed for older presenters, nearly all of whom were men. There were almost no women reporters recorded as older than 65. Part of this is likely due to recent improvements that have allowed more young women to enter the field, but it could also relate to the differences in how aging is perceived between men and women, as well as limitations in career advancement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Women's Media Center|Women’s Media Center]] (WMC) 2017 report on women and the media in the USA shows that at 20 of the nation’s top news outlets, women produced 37.7 per cent of news reports, an increase of 0.4 percentage points compared to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Women’s Media Center. 2017. The Status of Women in U.S. Media 2017. Available at https://www.womensmediacenter.com/reports/the-status-of-women-in-u.s.-media-2017. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In broadcast news, women’s presence as anchors, reporters and field journalists actually declined by nearly seven percentage points between 2015 and 2016.

=== Women and decision-making ===
[[File:Gender_equality_in_decision-making_positions_and_on_boards_in_media_organizations_in_Europe.svg|thumb|439x439px|Gender equality in decision-making positions and on boards in media organizations in Europe]]
The Global Report on the Status of Women in the News Media found that women in media occupied just over a quarter of the jobs in top [[management]] (27 per cent) and [[governance]] (26 per cent) positions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The regions that fared best for women representation were [[Central Europe|Central]] (33 per cent) and [[Eastern Europe]] (43 per cent) and the [[Nordic countries]] (36 per cent). Elsewhere, women comprised only about a fifth of governance positions and held less than 10 per cent of top management jobs in [[Asia-Pacific|Asia and the Pacific]] region. A major European project funded by the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE) found very similar findings: men held most of the senior management positions and board membership in 99 media houses across the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). 2017. Gender Statistics Database. Available at http://eige.europa.eu/gender-statistics/dgs. Accessed 8 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Asia and Pacific region, a joint report by the UNESCO Office in [[Bangkok]], UN Women and the [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) Asia Pacific&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Bangkok Office, UN Women and International Federation of Journalists 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; found women were significantly under-represented in decision-making roles.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In [[Southern Africa]], a Gender Links study found that women constitute 40 per cent of media employees and 34 per cent of media managers.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Ndlovu, Sikhonzile, and Tarisai Nyamweda. 2016. Whose news, whose views? Southern Africa Gender and Media Progress Study 2015. Johannesburg: Gender Links. Available at http://genderlinks.org.za/shop/whose-news-whose-views/. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The study also revealed that [[sexual harassment]] remains a key issue for women: just under 20 per cent of women media professionals said that they had personal experience of sexual harassment and the majority of those women said that the perpetrator was a senior colleague.

=== Representation ===
The 2015 [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|GMMP]] made a comparison across 20 years of women's representation in the media and assessed that between 1995 (17 percent) and 2015 (24 percent), female appearances in television, radio and print rose by only seven percentage points.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Sarah Macharia highlights the fact that where women most often appear in media, it is when they speak from personal experience (representing 38 per cent), while only 20 per cent of [[Spokesperson|spokespersons]] and 19 per cent of [[Expert|experts]] featured in stories are women.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women featured in stories as 32 per cent of experts interviewed in [[North America]], followed by the [[Caribbean]] (29 per cent) and [[Latin America]] (27 per cent). In the [[Southern Africa|southern African]] region, Gender Links’ 2016 Gender and Media Progress Study covered 14 countries and found that women’s views and voices accounted for a mere 20 per cent of news sources across Southern Africa media.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''Melzer's reagent''' (also known as '''Melzer's solution''' or informally as '''Melzer's''') is a [[chemical reagent]] used by [[mycologist]]s to assist with the identification of [[fungi]].

==Composition==
Melzer's reagent is an [[aqueous solution]] of [[chloral hydrate]], [[potassium iodide]], and [[iodine]]. Depending on the formulation, it consists of approximately 2.50-3.75% potassium iodide and 0.75–1.25% iodine, with the remainder of the solution being 50% water and 50% chloral hydrate.&lt;ref name=largent&gt;Largent D, et al. 1977. ''How to Identify Mushrooms to Genus III: Microscopic Features''. Arcata, CA: Mad River Press. {{ISBN|0-916422-09-7}}. p 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller OK, Miller H. 2006. ''North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi''. Guilford, CT: Falcon Guide. {{ISBN|0-7627-3109-5}}. p 549.&lt;/ref&gt; Melzer's is toxic to humans if ingested due to the presence of iodine and chloral hydrate.&lt;ref name=leonard/&gt; Due to the legal status of [[chloral hydrate]], Melzer's reagent is difficult to obtain. To cope with the problems procuring chloral hydrate, Rutgers scientists have developed a working substitute for use in Microscopy known as  [http://visikol.com Visikol™],&lt;ref&gt;http://otc.rutgers.edu/pdf/Simon-2012-146.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is compatible with [[Lugol's iodine]], forming a legal but mediocre replacement for Melzer's.

Melzer's reagent is part of a class of iodine/potassium iodide (IKI)-containing reagents used in biology; Lugol's iodine is another such formula.

==Reactions==
Melzer's is used by exposing fungal tissue or cells to the reagent, typically in a [[microscope slide]] preparation, and looking for any of three color reactions:
* [[Amyloid (mycology)|Amyloid]] or Melzer's-positive reaction, in which the material reacts blue to black.
* Pseudoamyloid or [[dextrinoid]] reaction, in which the material reacts brown to reddish brown.
* Inamyloid or Melzer's-negative, in which the tissues do not change color, or react faintly yellow-brown.&lt;ref name=largent/&gt;

Among the amyloid reaction, two types can be distinguished:
* Euamyloid reaction, in which the material turns blue without [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH)-pretreatment.
* Hemiamyloid reaction, in which the material turns red in [[Lugol's solution]], but shows no reaction in Melzer's reagent; when KOH-pretreated it turns blue in both reagents.&lt;ref name=baral&gt;Baral H-O. 1987. [http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0029/0399.htm Lugol's solution/IKI versus Melzer's reagent: Hemiamyloidity, a universal feature of the ascus wall.] ''Mycotaxon'' 29:399–450.&lt;/ref&gt;

Melzer's reactions are typically almost immediate, though in some cases the reaction may take up to 20 minutes to develop.&lt;ref name=largent/&gt;

The function of the chemicals that make up Melzer's reagent are several. The chloral hydrate is a [[clearing agent]], bleaching and improving the transparency of various dark-colored microscopic materials. The potassium iodide is used to improve the [[solubility]] of the iodine, which is otherwise only semi-soluble in water. Iodine is thought to be the main active staining agent in Melzer's; it is thought to [[iodine test|react with starch-like polysaccharides]] in the cell walls of amyloid material, however, its mechanism of action is not entirely understood. It has been observed that hemiamyloid material reacts differently when exposed to Melzer's than it does when exposed to other IKI solutions such as Lugol's, and that in some cases an amyloid reaction is shown in material that had prior exposure to KOH, but an inamyloid reaction without such pretreatment.&lt;ref name=baral/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohn LM, Korf RP. 1975. [http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0003/001/0165.htm Variation in ascomycete iodine reactions: KOH pretreatment explored.] ''Mycotaxon'' 3:165–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment in which spores from 35 species of [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycetes]] were tested for reactions to both Melzer's and Lugol's showed that spores in a large percentage of the species tested display very different reactions between the two reagents. These varied from being weakly or non-reactive in Lugols, to giving iodine-positive reactions in Lugol's but not in Melzer's, to even giving dextrinoid reactions in Lugol's while giving amyloid reactions in Melzer's.&lt;ref name=leonard&gt;Leonard LM. 2006. [http://www.namyco.org/images/pdf%20files/Melzer__Lugo.pdf Melzer's, Lugol's, or iodine for identification of white-spored Agaricales?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720025325/http://www.namyco.org/images/pdf%20files/Melzer__Lugo.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }} ''McIlvainea'' 16(1):43–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Melzer's degrades into a cloudy precipitate when combined with alkaline solutions,&lt;ref name=largent/&gt; hence it cannot be used in combination or in direct series with such common mycological reagents such as potassium hydroxide or [[ammonium hydroxide]] solutions. When potassium hydroxide is used as a pretreatment, the alkalinity must be first neutralized before adding Melzer's.

==History==
The use of iodine-containing solutions as an aid to describing and identifying fungi dates back to the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=leonard/&gt;

Melzer's reagent was first described in 1924 and takes its name from its inventor, the mycologist [[Václav Melzer]], who modified an older chloral hydrate-containing IKI solution developed by botanist [[Arthur Meyer (botanist)|Arthur Meyer]].&lt;ref name=baral/&gt; Melzer was a specialist in ''[[Russula]]'', a genus in which the amyloidy on the [[spore]] ornamentation or entire spore is of great taxonomic significance.&lt;ref&gt;The Russulales News Team. 2007. Introduction to the Russulales: [http://www.mtsn.tn.it/russulales-news/in_characteristics.asp Characteristics of the russuloid fungi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707154827/http://www.mtsn.tn.it/russulales-news/in_characteristics.asp |date=2013-07-07 }}, ''Russulales News'' (website).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Palo Alto Mental Research Institute''' (MRI) is one of the founding institutions of [[Brief psychotherapy|brief]] and [[family therapy]].&lt;ref name="Nichols, M. 2005"&gt;Nichols, M., &amp; Schwartz, R. (2005). ''Family Therapy: Concepts and Methods'' (7th Edition), New York City: [[Prentice Hall]].&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Don D. Jackson]] and colleagues in 1958, MRI has been one of the leading sources of ideas in the area of interactional/systemic studies, [[psychotherapy]], and family therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Weakland, J., &amp; Ray, W. (1995). ''Propagations: Thirty years of Influence from the Mental Research Institute'', New York: [[Haworth Press|Haworth]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
According to an article in the ''Psychotherapy Networker'' on [[Jay Haley]] (a  Research Associate at MRI in the 1960s) MRI "became the go-to place for any therapist who wanted to be on the cutting edge of psychotherapy research and practice. Fostering a climate of almost untrammeled experimentalism, MRI started the first formal training program in family therapy, produced some of the seminal early papers and books in the field, and became a place where some of the field's leading figures - [[Paul Watzlawick]], [[Richard Fisch]], Jules Riskin, [[Virginia Satir]], [[Salvador Minuchin]], [[R.D. Laing]], [[Irvin D. Yalom]], [[Cloe Madanes]] - came to work or just hang out".&lt;ref&gt;''Psychotherapy Networker'', November/December, 2007, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the Brief Therapy Center at MRI presented an innovative model for the comprehensive approach to brief psychotherapy, a model which, in turn, has influenced subsequent brief therapy approaches  throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Nichols, M. 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/us/15watzlawick.html Paul Watzlawick, Therapist Behind Rapid Diagnosis Strategy, Dies at 85 - [[New York Times]]&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Brief Therapy Center at MRI was founded by Dick Fisch, [[John Weakland]], and [[Paul Watzlawick]]. Continuing applied research and theory development have expanded the use of interactional concepts to community, school and business. Thousands of professionals within the U.S. as well as from many countries of the world have attended MRI training programs.&lt;ref&gt;[[www.mri.org MRI website]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''ménage à trois''''' ({{lang-en|"household of three"}}) is a domestic arrangement in which three people have [[romance (love)|romantic]] or [[sexual relations]] with each other, typically occupying the same household. A form of [[polyamory]], contemporary arrangements are sometimes identified as a '''throuple'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/throuple-meaning-what-you-do-in-a-three-person-relationship_uk_5798ba5be4b0796a0b611e7a Throuple Relationships vs Threesomes Explained: What It's Like To Be In A Three-Person Romance], ''[[HuffPost]]'', 2016 July 28.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''thruple'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/11/22/this-thruple-of-two-men-and-a-woman-want-to-adopt-kids/ A thruple of a married male couple and their girlfriend want to have kids], ''[[PinkNews]]'', 2017 November 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical instances==
&lt;!-- sorted in chronological order, where possible --&gt;

History has a number of examples of ''ménages à trois'' relationships.

Speculation exists that, in 1547–48, Queen [[Catherine Parr]], widow of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and her fourth husband [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]] were involved in a ''ménage'' with the future [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].  This is probably exaggerated, although  episodes of sexually charged horseplay involving the three were well attested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David |last=Starkey |authorlink=David Starkey |date=2000-04-27 |title=Elizabeth |isbn=0-7011-6939-7 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Linda |last=Porter |authorlink=Linda Porter (historian) |date=2010-03-19 |title=Katherine the Queen: The Remarkable Life of Katherine Parr |isbn=0-230-71039-5 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his youth, thirteen years her junior, the French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was a [[Wiktionary:protégé|protégé]] of the French noblewoman [[Françoise-Louise de Warens]], who would become his first lover. He lived with her at her estate on and off since his teenage years, and in 1732, after he reached the age of 20, she initiated a sexual relationship with him while also being open about her sexual involvement with the steward of her house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Rousseau|first=Jean-Jacques|title=Confessions|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-31500-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German intellectual [[Dorothea von Rodde-Schlözer]], her husband Mattheus Rodde and the French philosopher [[Charles de Villers]] also had a ''ménage à trois'' from 1794 until her husband's death in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Poulet|first=Anne L. |title=Jean-Antoine Houdon: Sculptor of the Enlightenment |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2003-12-12 |page=319 |chapter=Dorothea von Rodde-Schlözer (1770–1825) |isbn=0-226-67647-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EV0BgrzV-fkC&amp;pg=PA319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]] (British ambassador to Naples), his wife [[Emma Hamilton]], and her lover, the naval hero Admiral Horatio [[Lord Nelson]], were in a ''ménage à trois'' from 1799 until Nelson's death in 1805.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Constantine |first=David |authorlink=David Constantine |date=2001-03-08 |title=Fields of Fire: a life of Sir William Hamilton |page=242 et seq. |location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |isbn=1-84212-581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the age of 16, in 1813, the future author of [[Frankenstein]], [[Mary Shelley|Mary Godwin]], eloped with her to-be husband [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and engaged in a ''ménage'' with [[Claire Clairmont]], future lover of [[Lord Byron]], with whom the Shelleys would later have an extensive relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Who's who in British History: A-H|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fLeeV-mqlJMC&amp;pg=PA1115|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|date = 1998-01-01|isbn = 9781884964909|language = en|first = Geoffrey Russell Richards|last = Treasure|page = 1115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political philosopher [[Friedrich Engels]] lived in a ''ménage à trois'' with his mistress Mary Burns and her sister Lizzie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hands|first1=Gill|title=Marx: A complete introduction|date=2015|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9781473608696|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882 the Russian-born psychoanalyst and author [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]] invited the German philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Paul Rée]] to live with her, both of whom were in love with her. She kept her relationship with the two men celibate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Hollingdale |first=R. J. |author-link=R. J.

In 1913, [[psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]] began a relationship with a young patient, [[Toni Wolff]], which lasted for some decades. [[Deirdre Bair]], in her biography of Carl Jung,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Deirdre |last=Bair |authorlink=Deirdre Bair |date=2003-11-13 |title=Jung: A Biography  |location=Boston |publisher=Little, Brown |isbn=0-316-07665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes his wife [[Emma Jung]] as bearing up nobly as her husband insisted that Toni Wolff become part of their household, saying that Wolff was "his other wife".

The Russian and Soviet poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] lived with [[Lilya Brik]], who was considered his muse, and her husband [[Osip Brik]], an ''avant garde'' writer and critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Gray |first=du Plessix Gray |authorlink=Francine du Plessix Gray |date=2006-06-06 |title=Them: A Memoir of Parents

Computational and [[data mining]] tools are currently being developed and incorporated into the NBI to provide a logical framework to conduct species, route, dose, and scenario extrapolations and identify key data required to predict the biological interactions of nanomaterials.

Information currently being gained in the emerging field of [[nanotechnology]] is extremely diverse including a multitude of widely varying nanomaterials that are being or will be tested in a broad array of animal systems and [[in vitro]] assays. Knowledge of nanomaterial-biological interactions will likely only be arrived at upon inclusion and consideration of the entire body of data produced from global efforts in this research area. Compilation of this data will allow for the definition of nanomaterial structure-activity relationships. Such mathematical representations can be used to predict nanomaterial properties in the absence of [[empirical data]].

A '''near-death experience''' ('''NDE''') is a [[personal experience]] associated with death or impending [[death]]. When positive, such experiences may encompass a variety of sensations including detachment from the body, feelings of levitation, total serenity, security, warmth, the experience of absolute dissolution, and the presence of a light. When negative, such experiences may include sensations of torment and torture. &lt;ref name=Sleutjes2014rev&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25357254 | doi=10.1097/NMD.0000000000000205 | volume=202 | issue=11 | title=Almost 40 years investigating near-death experiences: an overview of mainstream scientific journals | year=2014 | journal=J.

Different models have been described to explain NDEs.&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt; [[Neuroscience]] research suggests that an NDE is a [[wikt:subjective#Adjective|subjective]] phenomenon resulting from "disturbed bodily multisensory integration" that occurs during life-threatening events.&lt;ref name=blanke2009&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Neurology of Consciousness|last=Blanke|first=Olaf|publisher=London: Academic Publishers, 2009|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374168-4|location=London|pages=303–324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 013.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Ascent of the Blessed]]'' by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] is associated by some NDE researchers with aspects of the NDE.&lt;ref name="Lommel2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pim van Lommel |title=Consciousness Beyond Life: The science of the near-death experience |publisher=HarperOne |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-06-177725-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Evelyn Elsaesser Valarino |title=On the Other Side of Life: Exploring the phenomenon of the near-death experience |year=1997 |publisher=Perseus Publishing |isbn=978-0-7382-0625-7 |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The equivalent [[french language|French]] term ''expérience de mort imminente'' (experience of imminent death) was proposed by the French [[psychologist]] and [[epistemology|epistemologist]] [[Victor Egger]] as a result of discussions in the 1890s among [[philosopher]]s and psychologists concerning [[Climbing|climbers']] stories of the panoramic life review during falls.&lt;ref&gt;Egger, Victor (1896). "Le moi des mourants", ''Revue Philosophique'', XLI : 26–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Neurological Disorders in Famous Artists, Part 3 |author=J. Bogousslavsky, M. G.

This was also the first time the phenomenon was described as clinical syndrome.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; In 1968 [[Celia Green]] published an analysis of 400 first-hand accounts of [[out-of-body experiences]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''Out-of-the-body Experiences'', London: Hamish Hamilton, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; This represented the first attempt to provide a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of such experiences, viewed simply as anomalous perceptual experiences, or [[hallucinations]]. In 1969, Swiss-American [[psychiatrist]] and pioneer in near-death studies [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross|Elisabeth Kubler-Ross]] published her groundbreaking book ''[[On Death and Dying|On Death and Dying: What the dying have to teach doctors, nurses, clergy, and their own families.]]'' These experiences were also popularized by the work of [[psychiatrist]] [[Raymond Moody]], who in 1975 coined the term "near-death experience" (NDE) as an umbrella term for the different elements (out of body experiences, the "panoramic life review," the Light, the tunnel, or the border). &lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; The term "near-death experience" had already been used by [[John C. Lilly]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Schlieter, Jens (2018). What is it like to be Dead? Near-death Experiences, Christianity, and the Occult. New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 205-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Common elements===
[[Research]]ers have identified the common elements that define near-death experiences.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop&gt;Mauro, James. "Bright lights, big mystery", ''Psychology Today'', July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Greyson]] argues that the general features of the experience include impressions of being outside one's physical body, visions of deceased relatives and religious figures, and transcendence of egotic and spatiotemporal boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Greyson, Bruce (2003) "Near-Death Experiences in a Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic Population". Psychiatric Services, December, Vol. 54 No. 12. The American Psychiatric Association&lt;/ref&gt; Many common elements have been reported, although the person's interpretation of these events often corresponds with the [[Culture|cultural]], [[philosophy|philosophical]], or [[religion|religious]] beliefs of the person experiencing it. For example, in the US, where 46% of the population believes in [[guardian angel]]s, they will often be identified as angels or deceased loved ones (or will be unidentified), while Hindus will often identify them as messengers of the god of death.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennard, Mary J 1998"&gt;Kennard, Mary J. "A Visit from an Angel." The American Journal of Nursing 98.3 (1998): 48–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Common traits that have been reported by NDErs are as follows:
* A sense/awareness of being dead.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;
* A sense of [[peace]], [[well-being]] and painlessness. Positive [[emotion]]s. A sense of removal from the world.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;
* An [[out-of-body experience]]. A perception of one's body from an outside position, sometimes observing medical professionals performing resuscitation efforts.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 4003364 | volume=139 | issue=6 | title=Near-death experiences in a pediatric population.

* A "tunnel experience" or entering a darkness. A sense of moving up, or through, a passageway or staircase.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"/&gt;
* A rapid movement toward and/or sudden immersion in a powerful light (or "Being of Light") which communicates with the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iands.org/ndes/nde-stories/iands-nde-accounts/1067-three-beings-of-light.html|title=Three Beings of Light|last=Lovins|first=LaDonna|website=iands.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An intense feeling of [[unconditional love]] and [[acceptance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/06/29/people-who-had-near-death-experiences-consistently-report-one-thing-gods-love/|title=Opinion {{!}} Stories of God's love common among those who almost die, says doctor who studies them|last=Long|first=Dr Jeffrey|date=2016-06-29|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encountering "Beings of Light", "Beings dressed in white", or similar. Also, the possibility of being reunited with deceased loved ones.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"/&gt;
* Receiving a [[life review]], commonly referred to as "seeing one's life flash before one's eyes".&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;
* Approaching a border or a decision by oneself or others to return to one's body, often accompanied by a reluctance to return.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"/&gt;
* Suddenly finding oneself back inside one's body.&lt;ref name= "Moody1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moody|first=Raymond|title=Life After Life|year=1975|isbn=978-0-89176-037-5|publisher=Mockingbird Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Connection to the cultural beliefs held by the individual, which seem to dictate some of the phenomena experienced in the NDE and particularly the later interpretation thereof.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Holden|editor1-first=Janice Miner|editor2-last=Greyson|editor2-first=Bruce|editor3-last=James|editor3-first=Debbie|title=The handbook of near-death experiences thirty years of investigation|date=2009|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-35865-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2017}}

===Stages===
[[Kenneth Ring]] (1980) subdivided the NDE on a five-stage [[continuum (theory)|continuum]]. The subdivisions were:&lt;ref&gt;Ring, K. (1980). Life at death: A scientific investigation of the near-death experience. New York: Coward, McCann, &amp; Geoghegan., p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;
# Peace
# Body separation
# Entering darkness
# Seeing the light
# Entering the light

Charlotte Martial, a neuropsychologist from the [[University of Liège|University of Liège and University Hospital of Liège]] who led a team that investigated 154 NDE cases, concluded that there is not a fixed sequence of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/near-death-experiences-what-happens-when-you-die-643032|title=What happens when you die? Scientists attempt to find out how similar near-death experiences really are|date=2017-07-27|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical circumstances===
Kenneth Ring argues that attempted suicides do not lead more often to unpleasant NDEs than unintended near-death situations.&lt;ref&gt;Ring, Kenneth. ''Heading toward Omega. In search of the Meaning of Near-Death Experience'', 1984, p. 45. "Subsequent research on suicide-related NDEs by Stephen Franklin and myself [Ring] and by Bruce Greyson has also confirmed my earlier tentative findings the NDEs following suicide attempts, however induced, conform to the classic prototype."&lt;/ref&gt;

===After-effects===
NDEs are associated with changes in personality and outlook on life.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt; Ring has identified a consistent set of value and belief changes associated with people who have had a near-death experience. Among these changes, he found a greater appreciation for life, higher self-esteem, greater compassion for others, less concern for acquiring material wealth, a heightened sense of purpose and self-understanding, desire to learn, elevated spirituality, greater ecological sensitivity and planetary concern, and a feeling of being more intuitive.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt; However, not all after-effects are beneficial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 7754094 | volume=18 | issue=3 | title=The meaning of survival: the early aftermath of a near-death experience | date=June 1995 | journal=Res Nurs Health | pages=239–47 | last1 = Orne | first1 = RM | doi=10.1002/nur.4770180307}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Greyson describes circumstances where changes in attitudes and behavior can lead to psychosocial and psychospiritual problems.&lt;ref name=Greyson1997&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9171810 | volume=185 | issue=5 | title=The near-death experience as a focus of clinical attention | date=May 1997 | journal=J.

==Research==
===Near-death studies===
{{Main|Near-death studies}}
[[Bruce Greyson]] ([[psychiatrist]]), [[Kenneth Ring]] ([[psychologist]]), and [[Michael Sabom]] ([[cardiologist]]), helped to launch the field of [[near-death studies]] and introduced the study of near-death experiences to the academic setting. From 1975 to 2005, some 2,500 self-reported individuals in the US had been reviewed in retrospective studies of the phenomena&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; with an additional 600 outside the US in the West,&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; and 70 in Asia.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; Additionally, prospective studies had identified 270 individuals. Prospective studies review groups of individuals (e.g., selected emergency room patients) and then find who had an NDE during the study's time; such studies cost more to perform.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; In all, close to 3,500 individual cases between 1975 and 2005 had been reviewed in one or another study. All these studies were carried out by some 55 researchers or teams of researchers.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt;

[[Melvin L. Morse|Melvin Morse]], head of the Institute for the Scientific Study of Consciousness, and colleagues&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morse M, Castillo P, Venecia D, Milstein J, Tyler DC. (1986) "Childhood near-death experiences". ''American Journal of Diseases of Children'', Nov;140(11):1110–4.&lt;/ref&gt; have investigated near-death experiences in a pediatric population.

=== Clinical research in cardiac arrest patients ===
==== Parnia 2001 study ====
In 2001, [[Sam Parnia]] and colleagues published the results of a year-long study of cardiac arrest survivors that was conducted at Southampton General Hospital. 63 survivors were interviewed. They had been resuscitated after being [[clinical death|clinically dead]] with no pulse, no respiration, and fixed dilated pupils. Parnia and colleagues investigated [[out-of-body experience]] claims by placing figures on suspended boards facing the ceiling, not visible from the floor.  Four had experiences that, according to the study criteria, were NDEs but none of them experienced the [[out-of-body experience]]. Thus, they were not able to identify the figures.&lt;ref name=Parnia2001primary&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parnia|first=S.|last2=Waller|first2=D.

Psychologist [[Chris French]] wrote regarding the study "unfortunately, and somewhat atypically, none of the survivors in this sample experienced an OBE".&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt;

==== Van Lommel's study ====
[[File:Pim van Lommel-1.jpg|250x250px|thumb|[[Pim van Lommel]]]]
In 2001 [[Pim van Lommel]], a cardiologist from the Netherlands, and his team conducted a study on NDEs including 344 cardiac arrest patients who had been successfully resuscitated in 10 Dutch hospitals. Patients not reporting NDEs were used as controls for patients who did, and psychological (e.g. fear before cardiac arrest), demographic (e.g. age, sex), medical (e.g. more than one [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR)) and pharmacological data were compared between the 2 groups. The work also included a longitudinal study where the 2 groups (those who had had an NDE and those who had not had one) were compared at 2 and 8 years, for life changes. One patient had a conventional out of body experience. He reported being able to watch and recall events during the time of his cardiac arrest. His claims were confirmed by hospital personnel. "This did not appear consistent with hallucinatory or illusory experiences, as the recollections were compatible with real and verifiable rather than imagined events".&lt;ref name=Parnia2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lommel2001primary&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Lommel|first1=P|last2=van Wees| first2=R|last3=Meyers|first3=V|last4=Elfferich|first4=I|title=Near-death experience in survivors of cardiac arrest: a prospective study in the Netherlands| journal=Lancet |date=15 December 2001 |volume=358 |issue=9298 |pages=2039–45|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)07100-8|pmid=11755611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Awareness during Resuscitation (AWARE) study ====
While at University of Southampton, Parnia was the principal investigator of the AWARE Study, which was launched in 2008.&lt;sup&gt;[[Sam Parnia#cite note-TIME magazine 2008-13|[13]]]&lt;/sup&gt; This study which concluded in 2012 included 33 investigators across 15 medical centers in the UK, Austria and the US and tested consciousness, memories and awareness during cardiac arrest. The accuracy of claims of visual and auditory awareness was examined using specific tests.&lt;ref name=Parnia2015primary&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parnia|first=Sam|last2=Spearpoint|first2=Ken|last3=de Vos|first3=Gabriele |last4=Fenwick |first4=Peter |last5=Goldberg |first5=Diana|last6=Yang|first6=Jie|last7=Zhu|first7=Jiawen|last8=Baker|first8=Katie|last9=Killingback|first9=Hayley|date=2014-12-01 |title=AWARE-AWAreness during REsuscitation-a prospective study |journal=Resuscitation|volume=85|issue=12|pages=1799–1805 |doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2014.09.004 |pmid=25301715}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such test consisted in installing shelves, bearing a variety of images and facing the ceiling, hence not visible by hospital staff, in rooms where cardiac-arrest patients were more likely to occur. The results of the study were published in October 2014; both the launch and the study results were widely discussed in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/04/the-science-of-near-death-experiences/386231/ |title=The science of near-death experiences: Empirically investigating brushes with the afterlife|last=Lichfield|first=Gideon|date=April 2015|website=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic|access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201409/seeing-the-light|title=Seeing the light |last=Weintraub |first=Pamela |date=September 2014 |website=Psychology Today|publisher=Psychology Today|access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review article analyzing the results reports that, out of 2060 cardiac arrest events, 101 of 140 cardiac arrest survivors could complete the questionnaires. Of these 101 patients 9% could be classified as near death experiences. 2 more patients (2% of those completing the questionnaires) described "seeing and hearing actual events related to the period of cardiac arrest". These two patients' cardiac arrests did not occur in areas equipped with ceiling shelves hence no images could be used to objectively test for visual awareness claims. One of the two patients was too sick and the accuracy of her recount could not be verified. For the second patient instead, it was possible to verify the accuracy of the experience and to show that awareness occurred paradoxically some minutes after the heart stopped, at a time when "the brain ordinarily stops functioning and cortical activity becomes isoelectric." The experience was not compatible with an illusion, imaginary event or hallucination since visual (other than of ceiling shelves' images) and auditory awareness could be corroborated.&lt;ref name=Parnia2014rev/&gt;

==== AWARE II ====
{{as of|2016|May}}, a posting at the UK Clinical Trials Gateway website described plans for [[Out-of-body experience#AWARE Study II|AWARE II]], a two-year multicenter observational study of 900-1500 patients experiencing cardiac arrest, which said that subject recruitment had started on 1 August 2014 and that the scheduled end date was 31 May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;UK Clinical Trials Gateway. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160509201054/https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/trials/trial-details/trial-details?trialId=31651 Primary Trial ID Number 17129], entitled "AWARE II (AWAreness during REsuscitation) A Multi-Centre Observational Study of the Relationship between the Quality of Brain Resuscitation and Consciousness, Neurological, Functional and Cognitive Outcomes following Cardiac Arrest" Last updated May 3, 2016. Page archived May 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The study was extended, and it is currently expected to end in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;https://psi-encyclopedia.spr.ac.uk/articles/aware-nde-study&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanatory models ==
In a review article, psychologist [[Chris French]]&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt; has grouped approaches to explain NDEs in three broad groups which "are not distinct and independent, but instead show considerable overlap": spiritual theories (also called transcendental), psychological theories, and physiological theories that provide a physical explanation for NDEs.

=== Spiritual or transcendental theories ===
French summarizes this model by saying : "the most popular interpretation is that the NDE is exactly what it appears to be to the person having the experience".&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt; The NDE would then represent evidence of the supposedly immaterial existence of a soul or mind, which would leave the body upon death. An NDE would then provide information about an immaterial world where the soul would journey upon ending its physical existence on earth.&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt;

According to Greyson&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; some NDE phenomena cannot be easily explained with our current knowledge of human physiology and psychology. For instance, at a time when they were unconscious patients could accurately describe events as well as report being able to view their bodies "from an out-of-body spatial perspective". In two different studies of patients who had survived a cardiac arrest, those who had reported leaving their bodies could describe accurately their resuscitation procedures or unexpected events, whereas others "described incorrect equipment and procedures".&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; Sam Parnia also refers to two cardiac arrest studies and one deep hypothermic circulatory arrest study where patients reported visual and/or auditory awareness occurring when their brain function had ceased. These reports "were corroborated with actual and real events".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parnia|first=Sam|date=February 2017|title=Understanding the cognitive experience of death and the near-death experience|url=https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article-abstract/110/2/67/2681812?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=QJM: An International Journal of Medicine|volume=110(2)|pages=67–69|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parnia2014rev" /&gt;

Five prospective studies have been carried out, to test the accuracy of out of body perceptions by placing "unusual targets in locations likely to be seen by persons having NDEs, such as in an upper corner of a room in the emergency department, the coronary care unit, or the intensive care unit of a hospital." Twelve patients reported leaving their bodies, but unfortunately none could describe the hidden visual targets. Although this is a small sample, the failure of purported out-of-body experiencers to describe the hidden targets raises questions about the accuracy of the anecdotal reports described above.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt;

Psychologist [[James Alcock]] has described the afterlife claims of NDE researchers as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. Alcock has written the spiritual or transcendental interpretation "is based on belief in search of data rather than observation in search of explanation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|title=Paranormal Borderlands of Science|date=1981|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Buffalo, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-87975-148-7|pages=153–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris French has noted that "the survivalist approach does not appear to generate clear and testable hypotheses.

=== Psychological explanations ===
French summarises the main psychological explanations which include: the depersonalization, the expectancy and the dissociation models.&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt;

==== Depersonalization model ====
A depersonalization model was proposed in the 1970s by professor of psychiatry Russell Noyes and clinical psychologist Roy Kletti, which suggested that the NDE is a form of [[depersonalization]] experienced under emotional conditions such as life-threatening danger, potentially inescapable danger, and that the NDE can best be understood as an hallucination.&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Noyes |first1 = R |year = 1972 |title = The experience of dying |url = |journal = Psychiatry |volume = 35 |issue = 2|pages = 174–184 |doi=10.1080/00332747.1972.11023710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Noyes |first1 = R. |last2 = Kletti |first2 = R. |year = 1976 |title = Depersonalisation in the face of life-threatening danger: an interpretation |url = |journal = Omega |volume = 7 |issue = 2|pages = 103–114 |doi=10.2190/7qet-2vau-ycdt-tj9r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Noyes |first1 = R. |last2 = Kletti |first2 = R. |year = 1977 |title = Depersonalisation in the face of life-threatening danger |url = |journal = Compr. Psychiat |volume = 18 |issue = |pages = 375–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noyes, R. and Slymen, D. (1978–1979) ''The subjective response to life-threatening danger''. ''Omega'' 9: 313–321.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, those who face their impending death become detached from the surroundings and their own bodies, no longer feel emotions, and experience time distortions.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt;

This model suffers from a number of limitations to explain NDEs for subjects who do not experience a sensation of being out of their bodies; unlike NDEs, experiences are dreamlike, unpleasant and characterized by "anxiety, panic and emptiness".&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; Also, during NDEs subjects remain very lucid of their identities, their sense of identify is not changed unlike those experiencing depersonalization.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt;

==== Expectancy model ====
Another psychological theory is called the expectancy model. It has been suggested that although these experiences could appear very real, they had actually been constructed in the mind, either consciously or subconsciously, in response to the stress of an encounter with death (or perceived encounter with death), and did not correspond to a real event. In a way, they are similar to wish-fulfillment: because someone thought they were about to die, they experienced certain things in accordance with what they expected or wanted to occur. Imagining a heavenly place was in effect a way for them to soothe themselves through the stress of knowing that they were close to death.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt; Subjects use their own personal and cultural expectations to imagine a scenario that would protect them against an imminent threat to their lives.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

Subjects' accounts often differed from their own "religious and personal expectations regarding death" which contradicts the hypothesis they may have imagined a scenario based on their cultural and personal background.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

Although the term NDE was first coined in 1975 and the experience first described then, recent descriptions of NDEs do not differ from those reported earlier than 1975. The only exception is the more frequent description of a tunnel.  Hence, the fact that information about these experiences could be more easily obtained after 1975, did not influence people's reports of the experiences.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

Another flaw of this model can be found in children's accounts of NDEs. These are similar to adults', and this despite children being less affected by religious or cultural influences about death.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

==== Dissociation model ====
The dissociation model proposes that NDE is a form of withdrawal to protect an individual from a stressful event. Under extreme circumstances some people may detach from certain unwanted feelings in order to avoid experiencing their emotional impact and suffering associated with them. The person also detaches from one's immediate surroundings.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

==== Birth model ====
The birth model suggests that near death experiences could be a form of reliving the trauma of birth. Since a baby travels from the darkness of the womb to light and is greeted by the love and warmth of the nursing and medical staff, and so, it was proposed, the dying brain could be recreating the passage through a tunnel to light, warmth and affection.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

Reports of leaving the body through a tunnel are equally frequent among subjects who were born by cesarean section and natural birth. Also, newborns do not possess "the visual acuity, spatial stability of their visual images, mental alertness, and cortical coding capacity to register memories of the birth experience".&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

=== Physiological explanations (organic theories) ===
A wide range of physiological theories of the NDE have been put forward including those based upon [[cerebral hypoxia]], anoxia, and [[hypercapnia]]; endorphins and other neurotransmitters; and abnormal activity in the [[temporal lobe]]s.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

Neurobiological factors in the experience have been investigated by researchers in the field of medical science and psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Mayank and Mukesh, 2004; Jansen, 1995; Thomas, 2004; Fenwick and Fenwick 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Among the researchers and commentators who tend to emphasize a naturalistic and neurological base for the experience are the [[Great Britain|British]] [[psychologist]] [[Susan Blackmore]] (1993), with her "dying brain hypothesis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bassham |first1=Gregory|title=Critical Thinking: A Student's Untroduction|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-07-287959-9 |page=485 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Neuroanatomical models ====
Neuroscientists Olaf Blanke and Sebastian Dieguez (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Leaving Body And Life Behind:[http://lnco.epfl.ch/files/content/sites/lnco/files/shared/publications/lnco/2009_Dieguez_NC(chap)_leaving%20body%20and%20life%20behind-out%20of%20body%20and%20near%20death%20experience.pdf lnco.epfl.ch]&lt;/ref&gt; from the ''[[Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]]'', [[Switzerland]], propose a brain based model with two types of NDEs : 
* "type 1 NDEs are due to bilateral frontal and occipital, but predominantly right hemispheric brain damage affecting the right temporal parietal junction and characterized by out of body experiences, altered sense of time, sensations of flying, lightness vection and flying" &lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt;
* "type 2 NDEs are also due to bilateral frontal and occipital, but predominantly left hemispheric brain damage affecting the left temporal parietal junction and characterized by feeling of a presence, meeting and communication with spirits, seeing of glowing bodies, as well as voices, sounds, and music without vection" &lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt;
They suggest that damage to the bilateral [[Occipital lobe|occipital cortex]] may lead to visual features of NDEs such as seeing a tunnel or lights, and "damage to unilateral or bilateral temporal lobe structures such as the [[hippocampus]] and amygdala" may lead to emotional experiences, memory flashbacks or a life review. They concluded that future neuroscientific studies are likely to reveal the neuroanatomical basis of the NDE which will lead to the demystification of the subject without needing paranormal explanations.&lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt;

[[File:Temporal lobe animation.gif|thumb|160px|left|Animation of the human left temporal lobe]]

French has written that the "temporal lobe is almost certain to be involved in NDEs, given that both damage to and direct cortical stimulation of this area are known to produce a number of experiences corresponding to those of the NDE, including OBEs, hallucinations, and memory flashbacks".&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

Vanhaudenhuyse ''et al''. 2009 reported that recent studies employing [[deep brain stimulation]] and [[neuroimaging]] have demonstrated that out-of-body experiences result from a deficient [[multisensory integration]] at the [[temporoparietal junction]] and that ongoing studies aim to further identify the functional neuroanatomy of near-death experiences by means of standardized EEG recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intensive Care Medicine |date=2009|publisher=Springer New York | isbn=978-0-387-92277-5 |location=[S.l.] |pages=961–968 |last1=Vincent |first1=Jean-Louis|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-92276-6_85|chapter=Towards a Neuro-scientific Explanation of Near-death Experiences?|citeseerx=10.1.1.368.4580}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to Greyson&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; multiple neuroanatomical models have been proposed where NDEs have been hypothesized to originate from different anatomical areas of the brain, namely: the limbic system, the hippocampus, the left temporal lobe, Reissen's fiber in the central canal of the spinal cord, the prefrontal cortex, the right temporal lobe.

Blanke et al.&lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt; admit that their model remains speculative to the lack of data. Likewise Greyson&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; writes that although some or any of the neuroanatomical models proposed may serve to explain NDEs and pathways through which they are expressed, they remain speculative at this stage since they have not been tested in empirical studies.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

==== Neurochemical models ====
Some theories hypothesize that drugs used during resuscitation induced NDEs, for example, [[ketamine]] or as resulting from endogeneous chemicals that transmit signals between brain cells, [[neurotransmitter]]s:&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt;
* In the early eighties, Daniel Carr wrote that NDE has characteristics are suggestive of a [[limbic lobe]] syndrome and that the NDE can be explained by the release of [[endorphins]] and [[enkephalin]]s in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carr | first1 = Daniel | year = 1981 | title = Endorphins at the Approach of Death | url = |journal = Lancet | volume = 317 | issue = 8216| page = 390 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(81)91714-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carr |first1 = Daniel | year = 1982 | title = Pathophysiology of Stress-Induced Limbic Lobe Dysfunction: A Hypothesis Relevant to Near-Death Experiences | url = | journal = Anabiosis: The Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 75–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endorphins are endogenous molecules "released in times of stress and lead to a reduction in pain perception and a pleasant, even blissful, emotional state." &lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt; 
* Judson and Wiltshaw (1983) noted how the administration of endorphin-blocking agents such as [[naloxone]] had been occasionally reported to produce "hellish" NDEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wiltshaw|first2=E.|year=1983|title=A near-death experience|url=|journal=Lancet|issue=8349|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(83)90582-2 |pages=561–562|last1=Judson|first1=I. R|volume=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be coherent with endorphins' role in causing a "positive emotional tone of most NDEs".&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt; 
* Morse ''et al''. 1989 proposed a model arguing that [[serotonin]] played a more important role than endorphins in generating NDEs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morse | first1 = M. L | last2 = Venecia | first2 = D | last3 = Milstein | first3 = J. | year = 1989 | title = Near-death experiences: A neurophysiological explanatory model | url = | journal = Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 45–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "at least with respect to mystical hallucinations and OBEs".&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt;

According to Parnia, neurochemical models are not backed by data. This is true for "NMDA receptor activation, serotonin, and endorphin release" models.&lt;ref name="Parnia2014rev" /&gt; Parnia writes that no data has been collected via thorough and careful experimentation to back "a possible causal relationship or even an association" between neurochemical agents and NDE experiences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Multi-factorial models ====
The first formal neurobiological model for NDE, included endorphins, neurotransmitters of the [[limbic system]], the temporal lobe and other parts of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gómez-Jeria|first2=Juan S.|year=1989|title=A Neurobiological Model for Near-Death Experiences|url=http://200.89.70.78:8080/jspui/handle/2250/14775|journal=Journal of Near-Death Studies|volume=7|issue=4|pages=205–222|doi=10.1007/bf01074007|last1=Saavedra-Aguilar|first1=J.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions and variations of their model came from other scientists such as Louis Appleby (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1989|title=Near·death experience: Analogous to other stress induced psychological phenomena|url=|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=298|issue=|pages=976–977|last1=Appleby|first1=L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors suggest that all components of near-death experiences can be explained in their entirety via psychological or neurophysiological mechanisms, although the authors admit that these hypotheses have to be tested by science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mobbs|first=Dean|last2=Watt|first2=Caroline|date=October 2011|title=There is nothing paranormal about near-death experiences: how neuroscience can explain seeing bright lights, meeting the dead, or being convinced you are one of them|url=|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=15|issue=10|pages=447–449|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2011.07.010|pmid=21852181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Low oxygen levels (and G-LOC) model  ====
Low oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxia or anoxia) have been hypothesized to induce hallucinations and hence possibly explain NDEs.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt; This is because low oxygen levels characterize life-threatening situations and also by the apparent similarities between NDEs and G-force induced loss of consciousness ([[G-LOC]]) episodes.

These episodes are observed with fighter pilots experiencing very rapid and intense acceleration that result in lack of sufficient blood supply to the brain. Whinnery&lt;ref name="Whinnery"&gt;Whinnery, J. E. (1997). ''Psychophysiologic correlates of unconsciousness and near-death experiences''. J. Near Death Stud 15: 231–258.&lt;/ref&gt; studied almost 1000 cases and noted how the experiences often involved "tunnel vision and bright lights, floating sensations, automatic movement, autoscopy, OBEs, not wanting to be disturbed, paralysis, vivid dreamlets of beautiful places, pleasurable sensations, psychological alterations of euphoria and dissociation, inclusion of friends and family, inclusion of prior memories and thoughts, the experience being very memorable (when it can be remembered), confabulation, and a strong urge to understand the experience."&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whinnery" /&gt;

However, hypoxia-induced acceleration's primary characteristics are "rythmic jerking of the limbs, compromised memory of events just prior to the onset of unconsciousness, tingling of extremities ..." that are not observed during NDEs.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; Also G-LOC episodes do not feature life reviews, mystical experiences and "long-lasting transformational aftereffects", although this may be due to the fact that subjects have no expectation of dying.&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt;

Also, hypoxic hallucinations are characterized by "distress and agitation" and this is very different from near death experiences which subjects report as being pleasant.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

==== Altered blood gas levels models ====
Some investigators have studied whether [[wikt:hypercarbia|hypercarbia]] or higher than normal carbon dioxide levels, could explain the occurrence of NDEs. However, studies are difficult to interpret since NDEs have been observed both with increased levels as well as decreased levels of carbon dioxide, and finally some other studies have observed NDEs when levels had not changed, and there is little data.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

==== Other models ====
French said that at least some reports of NDEs might be based upon [[False memory syndrome|false memories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = French | first1 = Chris | authorlink = Chris French | year = 2001 | title = Dying to Know the Truth: Visions of a Dying Brain, or False Memories? | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 358 | issue = 9298| pages = 2010–2011 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(01)07133-1| pmid = 11755600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Engmann (2008) near-death experiences of people who are [[clinical death|clinically dead]] are psychopathological symptoms caused by a severe malfunction of the brain resulting from the cessation of cerebral blood circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Engmann, Birk. (2008). ''Near-death Experiences: A review on the thesis of pathoclisis, neurotransmitter abnormalities, and psychological aspects''. MMW-Fortschr.Med.Nr.51-52/2008(150.Jg.) pp.42–43. {{PMID|19156957}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important question is whether it is possible to "translate" the bloomy experiences of the reanimated survivors into psychopathologically basic phenomena, e.g., acoasms (nonverbal auditory hallucinations), central narrowing of the visual field, [[autoscopy|autoscopia]], [[visual hallucinations]], activation of limbic and memory structures according to Moody's stages. The symptoms suppose a primary affliction of the [[occipital lobe|occipital]] and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] cortices under clinical death. This basis could be congruent with the thesis of [[pathoclisis]]—the inclination of special parts of the brain to be the first to be damaged in case of disease, lack of oxygen, or malnutrition—established eighty years ago by [[Cécile Vogt-Mugnier|Cécile]] and [[Oskar Vogt]].&lt;ref&gt;Vogt C, Vogt O. (1922). ''Erkrankungen der Großhirnrinde im Lichte der Topistik, Pathoklise und Pathoarchitektonik''. Journal für Psychologie und Neurologie; Bd. 28. Joh.- Ambr.- Barth- Verlag. Leipzig. (German).&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of neurology [[Terence Hines]] (2003) claimed that near-death experiences are hallucinations caused by [[Cerebral hypoxia|cerebral anoxia]], drugs, or brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hines|first1=Terence|title=Pseudoscience and the Paranormal|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, N.Y.|isbn=978-1-57392-979-0|pages=101–104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-cultural aspects==
Gregory Shushan published an analysis of the afterlife beliefs of five ancient civilisations (Old and Middle Kingdom Egypt, Sumerian and Old Babylonian Mesopotamia, Vedic India, pre-Buddhist China, and pre-Columbian Mesoamerica) and compared them with historical and contemporary reports of near-death experiences, and [[shamanism|shaman]]ic afterlife "journeys". Shushan found similarities across time, place, and culture that he found could not be explained by coincidence; he also found elements that were specific to cultures; Shushan concludes that some form of mutual influence between experiences of an afterlife and culture probably influence one another and that this inheritance in turn influences individual NDEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shushan|first1=Gregory|title=Conceptions of the Afterlife in Early Civilizations: Universalism, Constructivism, and Near-Death Experience|date=2009|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-0-8264-4073-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, it has been argued that near-death experiences and many of their elements (vision of God, judgment, the tunnel, or the life review) are closely related to religious and spiritual traditions of the West. It was mainly Christian visionaries, Spiritualists, Occultists, and Theosophists of the 19th and 20th century that reported them (Schlieter 2018).

According to Parnia, near death experiences' interpretations are influenced by religious, social, cultural backgrounds. However, the core elements appear to transcend borders and can be considered universal. In fact, some of these core elements have even been reported by children &lt;3 years old (this occurred over many months, whilst playing and communicated using children's language). In other words, at an age where they should not have been influenced by culture or tradition.&lt;ref name="Parnia2014rev" /&gt;

Also, according to Greyson,&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; the central features of NDEs are universal and have not been influenced by time. These have been observed throughout history and in different cultures. This notwithstanding, cultural influences have probably played a role in some NDEs' reported descriptions.

'''Neurovirology''' is an interdisciplinary field which represents a melding of clinical [[neuroscience]], [[virology]], [[immunology]], and [[molecular biology]]. The main focus of the field is to study [[viruses]] capable of infecting the [[nervous system]]. In addition to this, the field studies the use of viruses to trace neuroanatomical pathways, for [[gene therapy]], and to eliminate detrimental populations of neural cells.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Johnson, R (1995). "Neurovirology: evolution of a new discipline", ''Journal of Neurovirology'', 1(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The field of neurovirology was formed within the past 30 years.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It was founded upon the discovery that a large number of viruses are capable of invading and establishing latent infections in nervous tissue. Such viruses have been shown to produce slow, chronic, or progressive nervous system diseases.&lt;ref name="McKendall"&gt;McKendall, R and Stroop, W (1994). "Handbook of Neurovirology".&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|v}} Neurovirology incorporates the related fields of [[virology]], [[neuroscience]], [[neurology]], [[immunology]], and [[molecular biology]]. The main focus of the field is to study the molecular and biological basis of virus induced diseases of the nervous system. In addition to this, the field studies the use of these viruses as tracers of neuroanatomical pathways and as vectors for gene therapy.

The field relies upon [[neuroimaging]], isolation of the virus from brain tissue or CSF, serological testing of serum and CSF, and microscopic examination of tissue to diagnose nervous system infections.

==History==

Neurovirology only became an official field within the past 30 years.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, the true origin of neurovirology can be accredited to the discovery that some viruses may have an affinity for nervous system tissue. This discovery was made in the late 1880s with research involving rabies.&lt;ref name="Gosztonyi"&gt;Gosztonyi, G (2001). ''The Mechanisms of Neuronal Damage in Virus Infections of the Nervous System''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

In 1881, while studying rabies, Louis Pasteur demonstrated that the central nervous system played a crucial role in the progression of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Baer, T. R. Shanthaveerappa, G. H. Bourne (1965). "Studies on the Pathogenesis of Fixed Rabies Virus in Rats", ''Bull. Org. mond. Sante'', 33(783).&lt;/ref&gt; Following this discovery, in 1890, Schaffer demonstrated histological evidence that the rabies virus spread via neural networks.

In 1929 Heinrich Pette established the first classification criteria for inflammatory diseases of the nervous system. This classification separated the diseases into two groups: gray matter acute and white matter acute inflammatory diseases. Gray matter acute inflammatory diseases were characterized by damage to neurons with [[myelin]] remaining intact. White matter acute inflammatory diseases were characterized by destruction of the myelin, with neurons remaining intact.&lt;ref name="Gosztonyi"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

In 1938, Sbin and Olitsky discovered that the distribution of the virus within the body depended on its mechanism of entry.&lt;ref name="Gosztonyi"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

In 1965, ZuRhein and Chou established that destruction of myelin could result from primary virus infection, not only from autoimmune response to the virus.&lt;ref name="Gosztonyi"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Most of the research of which the field of neurovirology is based upon occurred in the late 1980s and the 1900s.&lt;ref name="Gosztonyi"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

Beginning in 1999 the International Society of Neurovirology has recognized and awarded individuals who have contributed significantly to the field with the Pioneer in NeuroVirology Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isnv.org/pioneer/past.php|title=International Society for NeuroVirology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viral entry into the nervous system==

Viruses have evolved mechanisms enabling them to easily infiltrate the nervous system. Two main methods of viral entry have been identified: transneuronal spread and hematogenous spread.

===Transneuronal spread===

The mechanism behind transneuronal spread is not entirely known yet, but it involves the virus escaping the immune system by traveling up the axons of the nerves.&lt;ref&gt;Wright E, Brew B, Wesselingh S (2008). "Pathogenesis and Diagnosis of Viral Infections of the Nervous System". ''Neurologic Clinics''. 26 (617).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hematogenous spread===

There are two main ways that a virus is thought to enter the brain via hematogenous spread. The first is by infecting an immune cell, which then carries the virus to the nervous tissue. Viral examples of this include the JC virus which infects B cells and HIV which infects CD4 T cells and macrophages to infiltrate the brain. The second is by crossing the blood capillaries as a free virus or in leukocytes.&lt;ref name="Nath"/&gt;{{rp|23}}

===Advantages of infecting the nervous system===

Neurons lack molecules necessary to present viral peptides on the surface to killer cells, which means they provide a safe house for viruses to replicate. Once viruses get in neurons they can persist for the hosts lifetime and can influence the factors that disturb the function of neurons and the homeostasis of the nervous system, leading to nervous system diseases.&lt;ref name="Nath"/&gt;{{rp|26}}

==Tools used for diagnosing neuroviral infections==

There are several diagnostic tools which have become invaluable to diagnosing viral infections of the nervous system. In the past, more invasive methods of obtaining samples for diagnosis were needed such as the use of [[brain biopsy]]. Now, with the advancement of technology, less invasive means are used more frequently, such as [[neuroimaging]] and the analysis of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF).

===Neuroimaging===

[[CT scans]] and [[MRI scans]] are useful in visualizing inflammation and lesions caused by viral infection of the CNS. MRI is used to visualize deep white matter and temporal lobe lesions, which are not well defined by a CT scan.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, E et al (2008). ''Pathogenesis and Diagnosis of Viral Infections of the Nervous System''. 26(617).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lumbar puncture and CSF analysis===

This method is valuable in diagnosing viral infections of the CNS. CSF analysis typically involves determining the patients total white cell count, glucose level, and protein level in the CSF. Viral infection of the CNS tends to increase the total white cell count, while increasing the level of protein. The levels of glucose tend to be decreased by viral infection, due to an increased glucose consumption.

===CSF nucleic acid amplification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)===

PCR is frequently used to for rapid identification of specific DNA viruses from the CSF, while Reverse transcriptase PCR is commonly used to identify RNA viruses in the CSF.&lt;ref&gt;Irani, D (2008). "Aseptic Meningitis and Viral Myelitis", ''Neurologic Clinics'', 26(635).&lt;/ref&gt;  The accuracy of this diagnostic tool is limited by the amount of the virus present in the CSF. Viral replication tends to peak early and then decline to undetectable levels in CNS infection. Within the first 5 days of symptom onset, before the decline of viral replication, PCR assays have a higher incidence of detecting CNS infection.&lt;ref&gt;Davies NW, Brown LJ, Irish D, et al. (2005). "Factors influencing PCR detection of viruses in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with suspected CNS infections". ''Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry''. 76 (82).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serology===

[[Serology]] is useful in diagnosing viral infections of the CNS when PCR analysis returns negative results.

===Brain biopsy===

In recent years, due to the development of less invasive diagnosis techniques, brain biopsies are no longer frequently used for diagnosing viral infections of the nervous system.&lt;ref name="Nath"/&gt;{{rp|35}} However, some viral infections of the CNS cannot be diagnosed without histological and electron microscopic evidence. In these cases, brain biopsies are only performed when the patient has a serious neurological illness and is in need of immediate therapy, an alternative procedure will not lead to a specific diagnosis, and the information gained by the brain biopsy will outweigh the risks.

==Research and therapy==

===Use of antivirals to treat CNS infection===

The use of antiviral treatment with both Multiple Sclerosis and AIDS dementia has proven ineffective as a treatment. In patients with Multiple Sclerosis, antiviral treatment of EBV with Acyclovir showed no significant difference from the placebo.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In patients with AIDS dementia, despite antiretroviral therapy, CNS function remains diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris M, Mactutus C, Booze R (2008). "Neurotoxic profiles of HIV, psychostimulant drugs of abuse, and their concerted effect on the brain: Current status of dopamine system vulnerability in NeuroAIDS". ''Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews'' 32(883).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of viruses for gene therapy===

HSV-1 is a promising gene therapy agent, which could be used for gene delivery to neurons. This therapy may be used to treat metabolic brain diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, or to help enhance repair of brain tissue in neurological diseases.&lt;ref name="Nath"/&gt;{{rp|121}}

==Future of field==

New viruses and viral infections of the nervous system will continue to emerge and the field of neurovirology must constantly expand to meet these growing needs.&lt;ref name="Nath"/&gt;{{rp|v}} While the interest in researching viruses that infect the nervous system has increased dramatically over the past 40 years, there are three key components vital for the continued advancement of the field:

# Training: New researchers and clinicians need to be trained about the significance of viral infection in the progression of neurological diseases.
# Technology: New technology needs to be refined and developed which will aid in the progression of research.
# Development of Therapy: Insight gained by research should be applied to the therapy of neurological diseases.

A [[slurry]] mixture of the non-explosive demolition agent and water is poured into the drill holes. Over the next few hours the slurry expands, cracking the rock in a pattern somewhat like the cracking that would occur from conventional explosives.

Non-explosive demolition agents offer many advantages including that they are silent and do not produce vibration the way a conventional explosive would. In some applications conventional explosives are more economical than non-explosive demolition agents. In many countries these are available without restriction, unlike explosives which are highly regulated.

These agents are much safer than explosives, but they have to be used as directed to avoid [[steam explosion]]s during the first few hours after being placed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19963">'''Pollution prevention (P2)''' is a strategy for reducing the amount of waste created and released into the environment, particularly by industrial facilities, agriculture, or consumers. Many large corporations view P2 as a method of improving the efficiency and profitability of production processes by [[Waste minimisation|waste reduction]] and technology advancements.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-05-01|title=Cleaner production and profitability: analysis of 134 industrial pollution prevention (P2) project reports |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652604000071 |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=13 |issue=6|pages=593–605|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2003.12.025|issn=0959-6526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative bodies have enacted P2 measures, such as the [[Pollution Prevention Act of 1990]] and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990]] by the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Harry |last2=Harten |first2=Teresa |last3=Springer |first3=Johnny|last4=Randall|first4=Paul|last5=Curran|first5=Mary Ann|last6=Stone|first6=Kenneth|date=1992|title=Industrial Pollution Prevention!

== Background ==
[[File:Los Angeles Pollution.jpg|thumb|303x303px|The pollution in Los Angeles is very evident, prompting calls for pollution prevention strategies.]]

=== Significance ===
Pollution prevention is any action (large or small) that reduces the amount of contaminants released into the environment. By implementing P2 processes, fewer hazards will be posed to both public health and natural well being. Thus, P2 is a key method to preserving [[natural resource]]s. It can also have significant financial benefits in large scale processes.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/p2/learn-about-pollution-prevention |title=Learn About Pollution Prevention |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC |access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long run, by implementing suggested P2 processes, large corporations may realize great benefits. If companies produce less waste, they do not have to worry about proper disposal. Thus, P2 is also a proactive measure to reduce costs of waste disposal and elimination.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

=== Sources ===
[[File:Port Auckland (373471767).jpg|thumb|Ships in port often have engines idling for days, releasing copious amounts of pollutants.]]
[[Port|Shipping ports]] are a significant source of pollution due to the heavy cargo traffic that these areas receive. The impact of these ships is quite widespread, affecting coastal communities and ecosystems across the globe. Most major shipping ports are located near environmentally sensitive [[Estuary|estuaries]]. These areas are particularly impacted by high levels of [[diesel exhaust]], [[Particulates|particulate matter]], [[nitrogen oxide]]s, [[ozone]], and [[sulfur oxide]]s. The solution for reducing port-related pollution is multi-fold, encompassing attainable alternatives and long-term reduction goals. Examples of simple steps include a restriction on engine idling for ships in the port and the use of cleaner grade diesel fuels. Some more expensive measures can be taken to mitigate the pollution of ships. Replacing older model ships with ships containing new engines allows the ships to meet modern emission standards. Exhaust systems can also be retrofitted in order to reduce exhaust emissions. Looking ahead into the future, there are a few technologies being developed. For example, plugging ships into “shore-side” power sources may eliminate the need for idling engines. Additionally, various sources of alternative fuel are being developed, the most significant of which is a [[fuel cell]] unit.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2004-10-01 |title=Pollution prevention at ports: clearing the air |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195925504000745 |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |volume=24 |issue=7-8 |pages=749–774 |doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2004.06.005 |issn=0195-9255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to increased trade, the emissions from ships are expected to become the second largest source of diesel particulate matter by 2020. One approach to reduction as set forth by the International Forum on Globalization (IFG) is to increase the amount of local trading, thereby reducing the number of miles that ships have to travel. Another approach regards the strategic placement of ports close to land transportation infrastructure (i.e. roads and railroads). Again, this reduces the number of miles that vehicles have to travel between the initial and final destinations. Railroads that reach all the way to ports are a significant way to produce less toxic pollutants, as this eliminates the need for less-efficient trucks to transport the goods from the coastal port to the inland railroad infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

=== Health Hazards ===
There are many health hazards associated with pollution that P2 strategies aim to mitigate. Long-term exposure to certain pollutants can cause cancer, heart disease, asthma, birth defects, and premature death.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Additionally, excessive pollution to water sources can be detrimental to the [[biodiversity]] present in different areas around the globe.

== U.S. Legislation ==
=== Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 ===
In order to enforce some of the notions of P2, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Pollution Prevention Act of 1990]]. Congress declared that pollution should be prevented and reduced wherever possible; in addition, any waste that must be released into the environment must be done in a responsible, environmentally-conscious manner. The law requires the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to:
* create effective policies
* establish a standard form of measurement of P2
* establish a network and advisory board among EPA offices to coordinate the prevention initiatives and data collection
* create a training program to be distributed to EPA offices
* identify aspects of policies that can be presented to and enforced by Congress
* create a model of source reduction that can be used to teach interested industries of P2 opportunities
* integrate a reward program to encourage companies to comply with regulations.

In order to enforce the points outlined in the Act, EPA is directed to present a report to Congress biennially. Another aspect of the report required that companies fill out a toxic chemical release form allowing EPA to collect information on the levels of pollution released into the environment.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

=== Clean Air Act ===
The [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990]] provided many P2 strategies, including governmental intervention, research and development programs, guidelines for efficient technologies, reduction of vehicle emissions, and a suggested Congressional status report.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

=== 2010-2014 Pollution Prevention Program Strategic Plan ===
The EPA ''2010-2014 Pollution Prevention Program Strategic Plan'' introduced a number of ways to reduce harmful industrial outputs (i.e. [[greenhouse gas]]es, hazardous materials) while conserving natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/p2/pollution-prevention-law-and-policies |title=Pollution Prevention Law and Policies |publisher=EPA |access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production techniques==
As an environmental management strategy, P2 shares many attributes with [[cleaner production]], a term used more commonly outside the [[United States]]. Pollution prevention encompasses more specialized sub-disciplines including [[green chemistry]] and [[Sustainable design|green design]] (also known as environmentally conscious design).

== Pollution Prevention in Industrial Processes ==
[[File:Truck load of ponderosa pine, Edward Hines Lumber Co, operations in Malheur National Forest, Grant County, Oregon, July 1942.jpg|thumb|Lumber is an example of a raw material that can be saved through implementation of pollution prevention processes.]]
The possibilities of P2 strategies are still being implemented at the corporate level, but benefits are already being realized by many companies. Recently, the view of P2 in industrial businesses has shifted from one of necessity to one of strategic advantage. If companies invest in P2 methods early in their development, they realize greater gains not too far down the road.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Additionally, if companies do not produce waste, they do not have to worry about properly disposing of it. Thus, P2 is a proactive measure taken to reduce costs in the long run that would have been dedicated to disposal and elimination of waste.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

There are two main ways to reduce waste through P2: waste reduction and technology improvements. Waste reduction at the source implies the same amount of input raw materials with less waste and more output of the product. Technology improvements imply changes to the production process that reduce the amount of output waste, such as an improved [[recycling]] process. Companies are moving past simply complying with the minimum environmental requirements, and they are taking a more strategic, forward-thinking stance on tackling the issue. However, the advancements in technology are still limited, implying that P2 techniques are still in the early stages of formation. The most profitable strategy is “in-process recycling.” Though it is not the most efficient form of “reduction at the source,” recycling is very profitable due to its ease of process. By engaging in recycling practices, industries not only cut down on the amount of material discarded as environmentally-hazardous waste, but they also increase profitability by reducing the amount of [[raw material]] purchased. The most widespread strategy is “reduction at the source,” which is the idea that byproducts of production can be reduced through efficient and careful use of natural resources. This method reduces the amount of dangerous pollutants present in waste before the waste is released. In turn, this creates a safer environment free of hazardous waste. This idea ties strongly into the benefits to corporations of investing in newer, more efficient technology.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Pollution Prevention Strategies ==

=== P2 Task Force ===
In order to reduce costs of P2 techniques, many officials are turning to pollution elimination strategies, thereby eliminating any need for end-of-pipe solutions. A task force was created by the EPA in order to directly target reduction strategies. The P2 program task force has 5 main goals:

# create feasible P2 objectives and corresponding time frames
# provide training to the individuals involved in the effort
# oversee the program's main tasks and measure progress
# evaluate the progress of the effort
# maintain the program's goals long term&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2008-01-15 |title=Sustainable development of process facilities: State-of-the-art review of pollution prevention frameworks |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438940701237X |journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials |volume=150 |issue=1 |pages=4–20 |doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.08.062 |issn=0304-3894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voluntary Approach ===
Voluntary approaches to P2 are on the rise. Governmental organization often collaborate with businesses and regulatory agencies to create a structure of guidelines. There are four types of voluntary approach programs: public voluntary programs, negotiated agreements, unilateral commitments, and private agreements. Public voluntary agreements are the least restrictive. Environmental authorities collaborate and create specific guidelines. Companies are then invited to follow these procedures on a strictly voluntary basis. Negotiated agreements are created through collaboration between public authorities and industry authorities. The agreement establishes bargains that are beneficial to the industry. Unilateral commitments are established by industry authorities alone, and the guidelines they set are [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulated]]. Private agreements are established between “polluters” and other affected parties. The regulations set forth create a compromise regarding a variety of pollution regulation strategies. The United States mainly follows the end-of-pipe prevention strategy. However, US President [[Richard Nixon]] created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970, and one of its principal missions was to regulate pollution. EPA’s implementation of policies is almost entirely voluntary.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2011-03-01 |title=A review of international practice in the design of voluntary Pollution Prevention Programs |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652610001150 |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=542–551 |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.03.015 |issn=0959-6526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few keys to a successful voluntary approach. First, the program needs a dependable source of funding (from the government, usually). The program also needs a dynamic relationship with the targeted industries. This creates a base of trust between all involved in the agreement. In terms of regulation, the program should be monitored by a reliable source. In order to assure that the program will establish itself long term, there should be visible benefits to the participants and obvious results to the greater community. The long-term establishment of the program also comes from setting attainable goals to measure progress.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Governmental Approach ===
EPA has published waste minimization guidelines that comprise 5 major steps:
# organizing the primary task force
# assessing the current pollution situation
# evaluating the feasibility of different program options
# reporting and planning the preparations based upon the analysis
# implementing the program.

This framework mainly benefits smaller facilities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Waste Reduction Approach ===
The Waste Reduction Algorithm (WRA) is used to quantitatively describe the benefits of different P2 strategies based on each unique facility. The WRA tracks pollutants through the entire production process in order to obtain accurate measurements.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Industrial Efforts ===
By maximizing P2 opportunities, some companies choose to redesign their entire industrial process. Managers focus more on what enters and moves through the entire process, instead of only focusing on the output. Overall, the P2 strategies that financially benefit companies are the most likely to be implemented. However, since P2 has only recently been realized as a cost benefit, many corporations have not adopted significant measures to realize the potential gain.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lober |first=Douglas J. |date=1998 |title=Pollution prevention as corporate entrepreneurship |url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/09534819810369554 |journal=Journal of Organizational Change Management |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=26–37 |doi=10.1108/09534819810369554 |issn=0953-4814|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Potential Benefits ====
Pollution prevention can also be viewed as a form of environmental entrepreneurship, as companies are increasingly concerned with the cost benefits of reducing the amount of waste created. For example, [[3M]] has accrued a savings of over $750 million since 1973 due to their implementation of P2 incentives. If implemented correctly, P2 strategies can result in an increase in yield, a commonly sought after result of industrial processes. Pollution prevention can also reduce the cost of waste removal because of the reduces amount of waste to remove. By preventing the amount of pollution released, companies can avoid some of the liability costs imposed when large amounts of pollution are released and contaminate the land on which the facility is located.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Individual Efforts ===
[[File:Senate Energy-efficient Lighting (28475055803).jpg|thumb|Installing energy efficient lighting and appliances are a relatively cheap way to reduce pollution on a smaller scale.]]
According to EPA, there are some everyday steps that can be taken to prevent pollution:

* Use paper in limited quantities, and print double-sided. Also, look for paper that has been made with recycled materials.
* When shopping, buy in bulk in order to reduce the amount of packaging required to package the goods. Look for products made with recycled materials. Bring reusable bags in which to carry purchased goods in order to reduce the number of disposed paper/plastic bags.
* Use water sparingly by installing water-efficient shower heads and faucets, and install [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient appliances]]. Make sure that sinks and hoses are not dripping. Do not excessively water plants.
* Use transportation efficiently, and utilize mass transportation when possible. Recycling used motor oil is also a way to eliminate the disposal of a hazardous material.
* Eating locally produced foods reduces the amount of fuel required for the food's transportation.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

Additional examples of P2 include using energy efficient machinery, developing clean-burning fuel, reducing the amount of chemicals released into water sources, creating a production process that results in a reduced amount of waste, and utilizing water conservation techniques.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

[[File:Gorn-1922.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Gorn'' (Furnace), an official organ of Proletkult]]
'''Proletkult''' ({{lang-rus|Пролетку́льт|p=prəlʲɪtˈkulʲt}}), a [[portmanteau]] of the Russian words "proletarskaya kultura" ([[proletarian culture]]), was an experimental Soviet artistic institution that arose in conjunction with the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917. This organization, a federation of local cultural societies and [[avant-garde]] artists, was most prominent in the visual, literary, and [[drama]]tic fields. Proletkult aspired to radically modify existing artistic forms by creating a new, revolutionary [[working class|working-class]] aesthetic, which drew its inspiration from the construction of modern industrial society in backward, agrarian Russia.

Although funded by the [[People's Commissariat for Education]] of [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]], the Proletkult organization sought autonomy from state control, a demand which brought it into conflict with the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] hierarchy and the Soviet state bureaucracy. Some top party leaders, such as [[V.I. Lenin]], sought to concentrate state funding on the basic education of the working class rather than on whimsical artistic endeavors. He and others also saw in Proletkult a hotbed of [[bourgeois]] intellectuals and potential political oppositionists.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

At its peak in 1920, Proletkult had 84,000 members actively enrolled in about 300 local studios, clubs, and factory groups, with an additional 500,000 members participating in its activities on a more casual basis.

== History ==

=== Factional background ===
[[File:A A Bogdanov.jpg|thumb|[[Bolshevik]] philosopher [[Alexander Bogdanov]], one of the founding fathers of the Proletkult movement]]

The earliest roots of the Proletarian Culture movement, better known as Proletkult, are found in the aftermath of the failed [[Revolution of 1905|1905-1907 Revolution]] against [[Nicholas II of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Mally, ''Culture of the Future: The Proletkult Movement in Revolutionary Russia.'' Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1990; pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[censorship]] apparatus of the Tsarist regime had stumbled briefly during the upheaval, broadening horizons, but the revolution had ultimately failed, resulting in dissatisfaction and second-guessing, even within [[Bolshevik Party]] ranks.

In the aftermath of the Tsar's reassertion of authority a radical political tendency known as the "[[Left Bolsheviks]]" emerged, stating their case in opposition to party leader [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].&lt;ref name=Mally4&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  This group, which included such luminaries as philosophers [[Alexander Bogdanov]] and [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] and writer [[Maxim Gorky]], argued that the [[intelligentsia]]-dominated Bolsheviks must begin following more inclusive tactics and working to develop more [[working class]] political activists to assume leadership roles in the next round of anti-Tsarist revolution.&lt;ref name=Mally4 /&gt;

Among the Left Bolsheviks, Anatoly Lunacharsky in particular had been intrigued with the possibility of making use of art as a means to inspire revolutionary political action.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, together with the celebrated Gorky, Lunacharsky hoped to found a "human religion" around the idea of [[socialism]], motivating individuals to serve a greater good outside of their own narrow self-interests.&lt;ref name=Mally5&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Working along similar lines simultaneously was Lunacharsky's brother-in-law Bogdanov, who even in 1904 had published a weighty philosophical tome called ''Empiriomonism'' which attempted to integrate the ideas of non-Marxist thinkers [[Ernst Mach]] and [[Richard Avenarius]] into the socialist edifice.&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;  (Lunacharsky had studied under Avenarius in Zurich and was responsible for introducing Bogdanov to his ideas.)  Bogdanov believed that the socialist society of the future would require forging a fundamentally new perspective of the role of science, ethics, and art with respect to the individual and the state.&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;

Together all these ideas of Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, Gorky, and their co-thinkers came to be known in the language of the day as "god-building" ''(bogostroitel'stvo).''&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;

These ideas did not exist in a vacuum; there was a political component as well. During the period between the failure of the 1905 revolution and the outbreak of [[World War I]], Alexander Bogdanov stood as the chief rival to Lenin for leadership of the Bolshevik party.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks: Lenin and His Critics.'' Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1986; pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the intellectually rigid Lenin, Bogdanov was not only a political rival, but also a positive threat to the [[ideology]] of [[Marxism]]. Lenin saw Bogdanov and the "god-building" movement with which he was associated as purveyors of a reborn [[Idealism|philosophical idealism]] that stood in diametrical opposition to the fundamental [[materialism|materialist]] foundation of Marxism. So disturbed was Lenin that he spent much of 1908 combing more than 200 books to pen a thick polemical volume in reply — ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism|Materialism and Empirio-Criticism: Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy]].''&lt;ref&gt;For ''Materialism and Empirio-Criticism,'' see: V.I. Lenin, ''Collected Works: Volume 14.'' Abraham Fineberg, trans. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1962; pp. 17-361. Details of Lenin's writing process may be found in the same volume, page 366, footnote 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenin ultimately emerged triumphant in the struggle for hegemony of the Bolshevik faction. Relations between them in Western European exile remained tense. During the first decade of the 20th Century Bogdanov wrote two works of [[utopianism|utopian]] [[science fiction]] about socialist societies on [[Mars]], both of which were rejected by Lenin as attempts to smuggle "Machist idealism" into the radical movement.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pp. 169-170.&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these, a book called ''Engineer Menni'' (1913), was pronounced by Lenin to be "so vague that neither a worker nor a stupid editor at ''Pravda'' [a rival publication] could understand it."&lt;ref name=Williams170&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pg. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 Bogdanov, a student of the [[Scientific management|Taylor system]] of factory work-flow rationalization, published a massive work on the topic, ''General Organizational Science,'' which Lenin liked no better.&lt;ref name="Williams170"/&gt;

The pair went their separate ways, with Bogdanov dropping out of radical politics at the end of 1913, returning home with his wife to [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pg. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; He would later be reinvigorated by the course of events to become a leading figure in the Moscow Proletkult organization — a fact which emphasizes the tension between that organization and state authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Mally argues that this traditional emphasis on Alexander Bogdanov as the "best known leader" of Proletkult helps obscure the fact that Proletkult's ongoing battle for "autonomy" ''(samostoiatel'nost')'' was in essence a fight with the state bureaucracy rather than the Communist Party, per se. See: Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The birth of Proletkult===
[[File:Moscow SpiridonovkaStreet Morozova Palace 01-2017.jpg|thumb|right|Morozova Palace, home of Proletkult]]
====Preliminary conference====
[[File:Anatoly Lunacharsky.jpg|thumb|left|Anatoly Lunacharsky, a founding father of the Proletkult organization, was People's Commissar of Education of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1929.]]

The [[February Revolution|February Revolution of 1917]] which overthrew the Tsarist regime came comparatively easily. So, too, did the [[October Revolution]] which followed, events which overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] of [[Alexander Kerensky]] and brought Lenin and the Bolsheviks to the seat of power. The [[Russian Civil War]] was another matter altogether — a long and brutal struggle which strained every sinew.

The radical intelligentsia of Russia was mobilized by these events. Anatoly Lunacharsky, who had briefly broken with Lenin and the Bolshevik Party to become a [[newspaper correspondent]] in [[France]] and [[Italy]], returned to Russia in May 1917 and rejoined the party in August.&lt;ref name=Fitz310&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment: Soviet Organization of Education and the Arts under Lunacharsky.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1970; pg. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the October Revolution, Lunacharsky was appointed Commissar of Education of the new regime.&lt;ref name=Fitz310 /&gt;

Lunacharsky's factional ally, Alexander Bogdanov, remained sharply critical of Lenin and his political tactics and never rejoined the Communist Party, however.&lt;ref name=Fitz295&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he served at the front as a doctor during World War I, returning home to Moscow in 1917 and becoming involved there as a founder of the Proletarian Culture organization, Proletkult.&lt;ref name=Fitz295 /&gt;

The aim of unifying the cultural and educational activities of the Russian labour movements first occurred at the Agitation Collegium of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet which met on 19 July 1917 with 120 participants. It was attended by many different currents, and when the [[Menshevik]] Dementiev suggested that the meeting just be confined to public lectures and that the [[Bolsheviks]] should be excluded, but this was soundly rejected. Consequently, the Central Council of [[Factory committee|Factory Committee]]s was instructed to work with the [[Petrograd Soviet]] to organise a second conference of "proletarian cultural-educational organizations" to bring them together in a centralized organization.&lt;ref name=Fitz89&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; A first conference of these groups was held in [[Petrograd]] from October 16 to 19, 1917 &lt;small&gt;(O.S.)&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=Fitz89 /&gt; The conclave was called by Lunacharsky in his role as head of the Cultural-Educational Commission of the Petrograd Bolshevik organization and was attended by 208 delegates representing Petrograd trade unions, factory committees, army and youth groups, city and regional dumas, as well as the Petrograd Committee of the Bolshevik and [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist-Revolutionary]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

This October 1917 conference elected a Central Committee of Proletarian Cultural-Educational Organizations of Petrograd which included among its members Lunacharsky, Lenin's wife [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]], talented young journalist [[Larisa Reisner]], and a long-time [[Vpered]] associate of Bogdanov and Lunacharsky named [[Fedor Kalinin]], among others.&lt;ref name=Fitz90&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Also playing a key role was [[Pavel Lebedev-Polianskii]], another former member of Bogdanov and Lunacharsky's émigré political group.&lt;ref name=Fitz306&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these would be catapulted into leading roles in the People's Commissariat of Education following the Bolshevik seizure of power which followed less than two weeks later.&lt;ref name=Fitz90 /&gt;

====After the Bolshevik seizure of state power====

Nikitin, Vasili Ignatov Standing from left to right: [[Stefan Krivtsov]], [[Karl Ozol-Prednek]], Anna Dodonova, N. M. Vasilevskii, [[Vladimir Kirillov]]]]
The October Revolution led to a marked increase in the number of new cultural organizations and informal groups.&lt;ref name=Mally33&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Clubs and cultural societies sprung up affiliated with newly empowered factories, unions, cooperatives, and [[soviet (council)|workers' and soldiers' councils]], in addition to similar groups attached to more formal institutions such as the [[Red Army]], the Communist Party, and [[Komsomol|its youth section]].&lt;ref name=Mally33 /&gt; The new government of Soviet Russia was quick to understand that these rapidly proliferating clubs and societies offered a potentially powerful vehicle for the spread of the radical political, economic, and social theories it favored.&lt;ref name=Mally33 /&gt;

The chief cultural authority of the Soviet state was its People's Commissariat of Education ([[Narkompros]]), a bureaucratic apparatus which quickly came to include no fewer than 17 different departments.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Headed by Anatoly Lunacharsky, this organization sought to expand adult literacy and to establish a broad and balanced general school curricula, in opposition to pressure from the trade unions and the [[Supreme Council of National Economy]], which sought to give preference to [[vocational education]].&lt;ref name=Mally35&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The as-yet loosely organized Proletkult movement emerged as another potential competitor to the primacy of Narkompros.

This confusing welter of competing institutions and organizations was by no means unique to the cultural field, as historian Lynn Mally has noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"All early Soviet institutions struggled against what was called 'parallelism,' the duplication of services by competing bureaucratic systems. The revolution raised difficult questions about governmental organization that were only slowly answered during the first years of the regime. Political activists disputed the authority of the central state, the role of the Communist Party within it, and the influence national agencies should wield over local groups. Altercations over scarce resources and institutional authority were intertwined with theoretical debates over the ideal structure of the new policy."&lt;ref name=Mally34&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, in the early revolutionary period control over local institutions by the central government of the Soviet state was weak, with factory workers often ignoring their trade unions and teachers the curriculum instructions of central authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt; In this political environment any centrally-devised scheme for a division of authority between Narkompros and the federated artistic societies of Proletkult remained largely a theoretical exercise. In the early days of the Bolshevik regime the local apparatus of Proletkult retained the most powerful hand.&lt;ref name=Mally36&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With its adherent Anatoly Lunacharsky at the helm of Narkompros, the Proletkult movement had an important patron with considerable influence over state policy and the purse. This did not mean an easy relationship between these institutions, however. Early in 1918 leaders of Petrograd Proletkult refused to cooperate with an effort by Narkompros to form a citywide theatre organization, declaring their refusal to work with non-proletarian theatre groups.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moscow Proletkult, in which Alexander Bogdanov played a leading role, attempted to extend its independent sphere of control even further than the Petrograd organization, addressing questions of food distribution, hygiene, vocational education, and issuing a call for establishment of a proletarian university at its founding convention in February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Some hardliners in the Proletkult organization even insisted that Proletkult be recognized as the "ideological leader of all public education and enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;Vasilii Ignatov, writing in ''Griadushchee'' (The Future) 1918, no. 4 (April 1918), pg. 15. Quoted in Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, however, the vision of Proletkult as the rival and guiding light of Narkompros fell by the wayside, subdued by the Proletkult's financial reliance on the Commissariat for operational funding.&lt;ref name=Mally44&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Proletkult received a budget of 9.2 million gold rubles for the first half of 1918 — nearly one-third of the entire budget for Narkompros's Adult Educational Division.&lt;ref name=Mally44 /&gt; Requisitioned buildings were put to the organization's use, with the Petrograd organization receiving a large and posh facility located on one of the city's main thoroughfares, [[Nevsky Prospect]] — the name of which was actually changed to "Proletkult Street" ''(Ulitsa Proletkul'ta)'' in the organization's honor.&lt;ref name=Mally44 /&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Plakat mayakowski gross.jpg|thumb|The poet as graphic artist: "proletarian art" in a civil war era poster by the [[Russian futurism|futurist]] poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], published by Narkompros. Mayakovsky makes use of stencil, simple agitational poetry, and primitive workerist graphics to create an almost [[folk art]] effect.]]

While the Proletkult movement began as independent groups in Petrograd (October 1917) and Moscow (February 1918), it was not long before the group's patrons in the Soviet state intervened to help forge a national organization.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet government itself moved from Petrograd to Moscow in March 1918 and the center of Proletkult's own organizational gravity shifted simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Mally45&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lines became blurred between the Proletkult organization and the Division for Proletarian Culture of the People's Commissariat of Education, headed by Proletkult activist Fyodor Kalinin.&lt;ref name=Mally45 /&gt; While the organization retained its staunch supporters in the Narkompros apparatus seeking to coordinate activities, it also contained no small number of activists like Alexander Bogdanov who tried to promote the organization as an independent cultural institution with a homogeneous working class constituency.&lt;ref name=Mally45 /&gt;

In September 1918 the first national conference of Proletkult was convened in Moscow, including 330 delegates and 234 guests from local organizations from around Soviet Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; While no delegate list has survived, the stenogram of the conference indicates that the bulk of attendees hailed from trade unions, factory organizations, cooperatives, and workers' clubs.&lt;ref name=Mally46&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates were split between those favoring an autonomous and leading role for the organization in general education in Soviet society and those who favored a more narrow focus for the group as a subordinate part of the Narkompros bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

While those favoring autonomy were in the majority at the first national conference, the ongoing problem of organizational finance remained a real one, as historian Lynn Mally has observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Although the Proletkult was autonomous, it still expected Narkompros to foot the bills. The government would supply the central Proletkult with a subsidy, to be distributed among provincial affiliates. But because financial dependence on the state clearly contradicted the organization's claims to independence, the central leaders held out the hope that their affiliates would soon discover their own means of support."&lt;ref name=Mally48&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proletkult and its desire for autonomy also had another powerful patron in the person of [[Nikolai Bukharin]], editor of ''[[Pravda]].''&lt;ref name=Fitz94&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Bukharin provided favorable coverage for Proletkult during the organization's formative period, welcoming the idea that the group represented a "laboratory of pure proletarian ideology" with a legitimate claim to independence from Soviet governmental control.&lt;ref name=Fitz94 /&gt;

Proletkult made use of different organizational forms. In large industrial cities, the organization set up an elaborate bureaucratic apparatus resembling that of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Fitz98&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow Proletkult, for example, had departments for literary publishing, theatre, music, art, and clubs.&lt;ref name=Fitz98 /&gt; In addition to this central bureaucracy, Proletkult established factory cells attached to the highly concentrated mills and manufacturing facilities.&lt;ref name=Fitz98 /&gt; Finally, Proletkult established "studios" — independent facilities in which workers learned and developed the techniques of the various arts.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narkompros, for its part, sought to influence Proletkult to concentrate its efforts upon the expansion of the network of studios.&lt;ref name=Fitz99&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1919 People's Commissar of Education Lunacharsky declared that Proletkult "should concentrate all its attention on studio work, on the discovery and encouragement of original talent among the workers, on the creation of circles of writers, artists, and all kinds of young scholars from the working class..."&lt;ref&gt;A. Lunacharsky, "Once Again on Proletkult and Soviet Cultural Organizations," ''Izvestiia VTsIK,'' No. 80 (April 13, 1919), pg. 2. Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proletkult and its studios and clubs gained a certain measure of popularity among a broad segment of the urban Russian population, particularly factory workers.&lt;ref name=Siegelbaum&gt;Lewis H. Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1992; pg. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1918 the organization counted 147 local affiliates, although the actual number of functioning units was probably somewhat fewer.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 51. See especially footnote 57 on that page.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peak of the organization's strength in 1920, Proletkult claimed a total of 84,000 members in 300 local groups, with an additional 500,000 more casual followers.&lt;ref&gt;Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929,'' pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 15 different Proletkult periodicals were produced over the course of the organization's short existence,&lt;ref name=Maguire157&gt;Robert A. Maguire, ''Red Virgin Soil: Soviet Literature in the 1920s.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1968; pg. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; including most importantly ''Proletarskaia kultura'' (Proletarian Culture — 1918 to 1921) and ''Gorn'' (Furnace — 1918 to 1923).&lt;ref&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/litenc/encyclop/le9/le9-5192.htm "Пролеткульт,"] (Proletkult). Fundamental Electronic Library of Russian Literature and Folklore, feb-web.ru/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideology===

Historically the relationship between the Russian liberal [[intelligentsia]] and the working class was that of teacher and student.&lt;ref name=CultFront19&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front: Power and Culture in Revolutionary Russia.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1992; pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This situation presumed a "higher" level of culture on the part of the aristocratic teachers — an accepted premise of the Bolsheviks themselves during the pre-revolutionary period.&lt;ref name=CultFront19 /&gt;

Under Marxist theory, however, culture was conceived as a part of the [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] associated with the dominant class in society — in the Russian instance, that of the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref name=CultFront20&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front,'' pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a workers' state, some [[theoretician (Marxism)|Marxist theoreticians]] believed, the new proletarian ruling class would develop its own distinct class culture to supplant the former culture of the old ruling order.&lt;ref name=CultFront20 /&gt; Proletkult was seen as a primary vehicle for the development of this new "proletarian culture."

The nature and function of Proletkult was described by [[Platon Kerzhentsev]], one of the movement's top leaders in 1919:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The task of the 'Proletkults' is the development of an independent proletarian spiritual culture, including all areas of the human spirit — science, art, and everyday life. The new socialist epoch must produce a new culture, the foundations of which are already being laid. This culture will be the fruit of the creative efforts of the working class and will be entirely independent. Work on behalf of proletarian culture should stand on a par with the political and economic struggle of the working class.

"But in creating its own culture, the working class by no means should reject the rich cultural heritage of the past, the material and spiritual achievements, made by classes which are alien and hostile to the proletariat. The proletarian must look it over critically, choose what is of value, elucidate it with his own point of view, use it with a view to producing his own culture. *  *  *

"This work on a new culture ought to proceed along a completely independent path. 'Proletkults' should be class-restricted, workers' organizations, completely autonomous in their activities."&lt;ref&gt;V. Kerzhentsev, ''Oktiabr'skii perevorot i diktatura proletariata'' (The October Overturn and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat). Moscow: 1919;  pp. 154-161. Reprinted in William G. Rosenberg (ed.), ''Bolshevik Visions: First Phase of the Cultural Revolution in Soviet Russia.'' Second Edition. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 1990; pp. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proletkult's theorists generally espoused a hardline [[economic determinism]], arguing that only purely working class organizations were capable of advancing the cause of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; An early editorial from the official Proletkult journal ''Proletarskaia Kultura'' (Proletarian Culture) demanded that "the proletariat start right now, immediately, to create its own ''socialist forms of thought, feeling, and daily life,'' independent of alliances or combinations of political forces."&lt;ref&gt;"From the Editors," ''Proletarskaia Kul'tura,'' 1918, no. 3 (March 1918), pg. 36. Emphasis in original. Quoted in Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of Alexander Bogdanov and other Proletkult theoreticians, the arts were not the province of a specially gifted elite, but rather were the physical output of individuals with a set of learned skills.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt; All that was required, it was assumed, was for one to study basic artistic technique in a very few lessons, after which anyone was capable of becoming a proletarian artist.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt; The movement by Proletkult to establish a network of studios in which workers could enroll was seen as an essential part of training this new cohort of proletarian artists.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt;

Despite the organization's rhetoric about its proletarian exclusivity, however, the movement was guided by intellectuals throughout its entire brief history, with its efforts to promote workers from the bench to leadership positions largely unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929,'' pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on the various arts===

====Literature====

Proletkult expended great energy in attempting to launch a wave of worker-poets, with only limited artistic success. The insistence upon developing new poets of questionable talent led to a split of the Proletkult in 1919, when a large group of young writers, most of whom were poets, broke from the organization due to what they believed to be a stifling of individual creative talent.&lt;ref name=Maguire158&gt;Maguire, ''Red Virgin Soil,'' pg. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

These defectors from Proletkult initially formed a small, elite organization called Kuznitza (The Forge) before again launching a new [[mass organization]] known as the [[All-Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]] (VAPP) a year later.&lt;ref name=Maguire158 /&gt;

====Theater====
{{main|Proletcult Theatre}}
The Proletkult organizations of Petrograd and Moscow controlled their own dramatic theatrical network, including under its umbrella a number of smaller city clubs maintaining their own theatrical studios.&lt;ref name=Acts31&gt;Lynn Mally, ''Revolutionary Acts: Amateur Theater and the Soviet State, 1917-1938.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2000; pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrograd Proletkult opened a large central studio early in 1918 which staged a number of new and experimental works with a view to inspiring similar performances in other amateur theaters around the city.&lt;ref name=Acts31 /&gt; Moscow Proletkult opened its own central theater several months later.&lt;ref name=Acts31 /&gt;

Proletkult constituted the leading center of a radical minority within the theatrical community of the day which aspired to promote so-called "proletarian theater."&lt;ref name=Acts22&gt;Mally, ''Revolutionary Acts,'' pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Development of this new form was defined in one early conference resolution as "the task of workers themselves, along with those peasants who are willing to accept their ideology."&lt;ref name=Acts22 /&gt; Conventional modes of performance were discouraged, in favor of unconventional stagings designed to promote "mass action" — including public processions, festivals, and social dramas.&lt;ref name=Acts22 /&gt;

===Contemporary criticism===

Artists in the Proletkult movement, while not by any means a homogeneous bloc, were influenced to a great extent by the [[iconoclasm]], technological orientation, and revolutionary enthusiasm bound up in the thematic movements of the day, [[Russian futurism|futurism]] and [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]].&lt;ref name=Fitz100&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite lip service paid to classical forms of poetry, drama, writing, sculpture, and painting, strong encouragement was given to the use of new techniques and forms in so-called "proletarian art," including the use of photography, cinematography, and collage.&lt;ref name=Fitz100 /&gt;

This commitment to experimentalism drew the fire of those party leaders who preferred more classical modes of artistic expression. Petrograd Communist Party leader [[Grigory Zinoviev]]  took the lead at a conference of "proletarian writers" held in that city in the fall of 1919, declaring that while previously "we allowed the most nonsensical futurism to get a reputation almost as the official school of Communist art" and let "doubtful elements attach themselves to our Proletkults."&lt;ref name=Zin&gt;Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; it was henceforth "time to put an end to this," Zinoviev demanded.&lt;ref name=Zin /&gt;

Also among those critical of the Proletkult movement and its vision to create a wholly new proletarian culture was top Soviet party leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]. At a public speech in May 1919 Lenin declared any notions of so-called "proletarian culture" to be "fantasies" which he opposed with "ruthless hostility."&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Lenin, ''Polnoe sobranie sochineniia: Tom 38, Mart—Iiun' 1919.'' Moscow: Politizdat, 1969; pp. 368-369. Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, Lenin had profound misgivings about the entire institution of Proletkult, viewing it as (in historian [[Sheila Fitzpatrick|Sheila Fitzpatrick's]] words) "an organization where futurists, idealists, and other undesirable bourgeois artists and intellectuals addled the minds of workers who needed basic education and culture..."&lt;ref name=CultFront22&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front,'' pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin also may have had political misgivings about the organization as a potential base of power for his long-time rival [[Alexander Bogdanov]] or for ultra-radical [[Left communism|"Left Communists"]] and the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] dissidents who comprised the [[Workers' Opposition]].&lt;ref name=CultFront22 /&gt;

===Dissolution===
[[File:Vintage Potemkin.jpg|thumb|The ethic of Proletkult is found in the early cinematic works of Sergei Eisenstein. This promotional poster for his 1926 film ''The Battleship Potemkin'' making use of indistinct masses of people and diagonal lines is exemplary of [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]].]]

By the fall of 1920 it became increasingly clear that the Soviet regime would emerge from the Russian Civil War victorious. With fall of the [[White movement|Whites]], a common enemy which united disparate factions around the Soviet banner, much unity was loosened. Dissident groups such as the so-called Workers' Opposition and the [[Group of Democratic Centralism|Democratic Centralists]] emerged in the Communist Party, widespread dissatisfaction among the [[peasantry]] over forced grain requisitioning resulted in isolated uprisings. All of these factors prompted a wave of debate about the institutions that had sprung up in Soviet society during wartime, including Proletkult.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its short history, Proletkult had sought both autonomy from state control and hegemony in the cultural field. This had created a substantial number of critics and rivals. These included leaders of the Soviet trade union movement, who saw the management of workers' cultural opportunities as part of their own purview; local Communist Party committees, which sought centralization under their own direction rather than a hode-podge of autonomous civic institutions; and the People's Commissariat of Education (Narkompros), which believed its own mission included the cultural training of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, Narkompros proved the most outspoken and unyielding in its criticism.&lt;ref name=Mally197&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since 1918 [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]] — the wife of Vladimir Lenin — had sought to reign in Proletkult and integrate it under the agency in which she herself played a leading role, the Adult Education Division of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally197 /&gt; A May 1919 conference of adult education workers had, spurred on by Krupskaya, determined that Proletkult was an adult education agency owing to its studio system, and therefore rightfully part of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally197 /&gt;

Bureaucratic wrangling between top leaders of Proletkult and the Adult Education Division of Narkompros had produced a working agreement in the summer of 1919 bringing Proletkult formally under the auspices of the latter, albeit with its own separate budget.&lt;ref name=Mally198&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; This proved, however, to be a stop-gap and institutional conflict remained.&lt;ref name=Mally198 /&gt;

Proletkult leaders subsequently made an effort to expand their movement on an international basis at the [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern|2nd World Congress of the Communist International]] in August 1920, founding [[Kultintern]], an international organization headed by Anatoly Lunacharsky.&lt;ref name=Mally200&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's grandiose vision and practical efforts to expand the Proletkult movement globally was particularly concerning to Lenin, himself a man of staid and traditional cultural tastes who had already come to see Proletkult as utopian and wasteful.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 199, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurred to action by Lenin, in the fall of 1920 the governing Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) &lt;!---this is the correct name and capitalization for the organization---&gt; began to take an active interest in the relationship of Proletkult with other Soviet institutions for the first time.&lt;ref name=Mally198 /&gt; Lenin sought and obtained information from [[M. N. Pokrovsky|M.N. Pokrovsky]], second in command at Narkompros, and top Proletkult leaders about the organization's budget and semi-independent status and pushed through a decision to absorb Proletkult into Narkompros to end the situation of parallelism once and for all.&lt;ref name=Mally201&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

The already scheduled National Congress of Proletkult, held in Moscow from October 5 to 12, 1920, was to be the occasion for the announcement.&lt;ref name=Mally201 /&gt; While Lunacharsky, head of Narkompros but a patron of Proletkult and its interests, dragged his feet on the merger, the congress eventually — following long debate and a stern appeal to party discipline — formally approved the Central Committee's decision to directly integrate Proletkult into Narkompros.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The integration was not a smooth one, however, and Proletkult activists fought to the last ditch to retain organizational autonomy even within Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally203&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Committee reacted with a scathing decree denouncing Proletkult that was published in ''Pravda'' on December 1, 1920.

===Legacy===

Despite its formal termination as an organization, the Proletkult movement continued to influence and inform early Soviet culture. Historian Peter Kenez has noted the heavy influence of the Proletkult ethic in the work of pioneer Soviet filmmaker [[Sergei Eisenstein]], director of the classic films ''[[Strike (1925 film)|Strike]]'' (1925), ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1926), and ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]'' (1927):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The intellectual content of [Eisenstein's] early films was profoundly influenced by his earlier association with Proletkult, a complex politicocultural movement that reached the height of its influence during the revolutionary period.... [Its leaders] argued that the new, socialist culture would be profoundly different from what it replaced. In their view there could be no accommodation with the old world; the proletariat on the basis of its experience would create a new culture that would reflect the spirit of the collective. It followed that the new art had to emphasize not the accomplishments of individuals but those of the workers and peasants. Eisenstein was attracted to this movement because it justified the necessity of a complete break with the art of the '[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]' world. All of his early films expressed, though in his own idiom, the ideology of Proletkult."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kenez, ''Cinema and Soviet Society, 1917-1953.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992; pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:T72 Georgia.jpg|thumb|right|A [[T-72]] tank layered with reactive armour bricks.]]

'''Reactive armour''' is a type of [[vehicle armor|vehicle armour]] that reacts in some way to the impact of a weapon to reduce the damage done to the vehicle being protected. It is most effective in protecting against [[shaped charge]]s and specially hardened [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s. The most common type is ''explosive reactive armour'' (ERA), but variants include ''self-limiting explosive reactive armour'' (SLERA), ''non-energetic reactive armour'' (NERA), ''non-explosive reactive armour'' (NxRA), and electric reactive armour. NERA and NxRA modules can withstand multiple hits, unlike ERA and SLERA, but a second hit in exactly the same location may potentially penetrate any of those.

Essentially all anti-tank munitions work by piercing the armour and killing the crew inside, disabling vital mechanical systems, or both. Reactive armour can be defeated with multiple hits in the same place, as by [[tandem-charge]] weapons, which fire two or more [[shaped charge]]s in rapid succession. Without tandem charges, hitting the same spot twice is much more difficult.

==History==
[[File:IDET2007 reactive armor DYNA.jpg|thumb|right|Reactive armour "DYNA" for T-72 MBT]]

The idea of counterexplosion (''kontrvzryv'' in Russian) in armour was first proposed by the Scientific Research Institute of Steel (NII Stali) in 1949 in the USSR by academician [http://www.prometeus.nsc.ru/eng/science/schools/voitsekh/ Bogdan Vjacheslavovich Voitsekhovsky]{{failed verification|date=November 2017}}
(1922–1999). The first pre-production models were produced during the 1960s. However, insufficient theoretical analysis during one of the tests resulted in all of the prototype elements being blown up.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} For a number of reasons, including the accident, as well as a belief that Soviet tanks had sufficient armour, the research was ended. No more research was conducted until 1974 when the Ministry of the Defensive Industry announced a contest to find the best tank protection project.

A West German researcher, Manfred Held carried out similar work with the [[Israeli defence force|IDF]] in 1967–69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TtpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=Israel's+Clandestine+Diplomacies+MANFRED+HELD&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hmAx-J-DRN&amp;sig=5Q-zQU9yxOFn60BOqmWU9vbvs-Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXmcyY37XUAhXHDxoKHVypARQQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Israel's+Clandestine+Diplomacies+MANFRED+HELD&amp;f=false|title=Israel's Clandestine Diplomacies|first1=Clive|last1=Jones|first2=Tore T.|last2=Petersen|date=1 November 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactive armour created on the basis of the joint research was first installed on Israeli tanks during the [[1982 Lebanon war]] and was judged very effective.{{bywhom|date=June 2017}}

== Explosive reactive armour ==
[[File:Indian Army T-90.jpg|thumb|left|The advanced [[Kontakt-5]] explosive reactive armour on this [[T-90]]S is arranged in pairs of plates, giving the turret its prominent triangular profile.]]

[[File:IDET2007 reactive armor detail2.jpg|thumb|right|Reactive armour detail]]

[[File:Image Explosive Reactive Armor.png|thumb|right]]

An element of explosive reactive armour consists of a sheet or slab of high explosive sandwiched between two plates, typically metal, called the reactive or dynamic elements. On attack by a penetrating weapon, the explosive detonates, forcibly driving the metal plates apart to damage the penetrator. Against a shaped charge, the projected plates disrupt the metallic jet penetrator, effectively providing a greater path-length of material to be penetrated. Against a kinetic energy penetrator, the projected plates serve to deflect and break up the rod.

The disruption is attributed to two mechanisms.  First, the moving plates change the effective velocity and angle of impact of the shaped charge jet, reducing the angle of incidence and increasing the effective jet velocity versus the plate element.  Second, since the plates are angled compared to the usual impact direction of shaped charge warheads, as the plates move outwards the impact point on the plate moves over time, requiring the jet to cut through fresh plate material.  This second effect significantly increases the effective plate thickness during the impact.

To be effective against kinetic energy projectiles, ERA (Explosive Reactive Armour) must use much thicker and heavier plates and a correspondingly thicker explosive layer.  Such "heavy ERA," such as the Soviet-developed [[Kontakt-5]], can break apart a penetrating rod that is longer than the ERA is deep, again significantly reducing penetration capability.

An important aspect of ERA is the [[brisance]], or detonation speed of its explosive element.  A more brisant explosive and greater plate velocity will result in more plate material being fed into the path of the oncoming jet, greatly increasing the plate's effective thickness. This effect is especially pronounced in the rear plate receding away from the jet, which triples in effective thickness with double the velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Held|first1=Manfred|title=Dr.|journal=Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics|date=20 Aug 2004|volume=29|issue=4|page=245|doi=10.1002/prep.200400051|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prep.200400051/pdf|accessdate=20 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERA also counters explosively forged projectiles, as produced by a shaped charge.  The counter-explosion must disrupt the incoming projectile so that its momentum is distributed in all directions rather than towards the target, greatly diminishing its effectiveness.

Explosive reactive armour has been valued by the [[Soviet Union]] and its now-independent component states since the 1980s, and almost every tank in the eastern-European military inventory today has either been manufactured to use ERA or had ERA tiles added to it, including even the [[T-55]] and [[T-62]] tanks built forty to fifty years ago, but still used today by reserve units. The U.S. Army uses reactive armour on its Abrams tanks as part of the TUSK (Tank Urban Survivability Kit) package and on Bradley vehicles and the Israelis use it frequently on their American built [[M60 Patton|M60]] tanks.

ERA tiles are used as add-on (or "appliqué") armour to the portions of an [[armoured fighting vehicle]] that are most likely to be hit, typically the front ([[glacis]]) of the hull and the front and sides of the turret. Their use requires that a vehicle be fairly heavily armoured to protect itself and its crew from the exploding ERA.

A further complication to the use of ERA is the inherent danger to anyone near the tank when a plate detonates, disregarding that a [[high explosive anti-tank warhead|high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) warhead explosion would already cause great danger to anyone near the tank. Although ERA plates are intended only to bulge following detonation, the combined energy of the ERA explosive, coupled with the kinetic or explosive energy of the projectile, will frequently cause explosive fragmentation of the plate. The explosion of an ERA plate creates a significant amount of shrapnel, and bystanders are in grave danger of fatal injury. Thus, infantry must operate some distance from vehicles protected by ERA in combined arms operations.

== Non-explosive and non-energetic reactive armour ==

NERA and NxRA operate similarly to explosive reactive armour, but without the explosive liner.  Two metal plates sandwich an inert liner, such as rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defense-update.com/features/du-1-04/feature-armor-protection.htm |title=Protection Systems For Future Armored Vehicles |accessdate=2008-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830004857/http://defense-update.com/features/du-1-04/feature-armor-protection.htm |archive-date=2008-08-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When struck by a shaped charge's metal jet, some of the impact energy is dissipated into the inert liner layer, and the resulting high pressure causes a localized bending or bulging of the plates in the area of the impact.  As the plates bulge, the point of jet impact shifts with the plate bulging, increasing the effective thickness of the armour.  This is almost the same as the second mechanism that explosive reactive armour uses, but it uses energy from the shaped charge jet rather than from explosives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220060011057%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20060011057&amp;RS=DN/20060011057 Non-explosive energetic material and a reactive armour element using same], US Patent Application 20060011057, accessed August 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the inner liner is non-explosive, the bulging is less energetic than on explosive reactive armour, and thus offers less protection than a similarly-sized ERA.  However, NERA and NxRA are lighter, safe to handle, safer for nearby infantry, can theoretically be placed on any part of the vehicle, and can be packaged in multiple spaced layers if needed. A key advantage of this kind of armour is that it cannot be defeated via tandem warhead shaped charges, which employ a small forward warhead to detonate ERA before the main warhead fires.

== Electric reactive armour ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}
A new technology called ''electric reactive armour'' (also termed ''electromagnetic reactive armour'', or colloquially as ''electric armour'') is in development. This armour is made up of two or more conductive plates separated by an air gap or by an insulating material, creating a high-power [[capacitor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2002/08/54641 U.S. Military Uses the Force] (Wired News)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,539143,00.html 'Star Trek' shields to protect supertanks] (The Guardian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

When an incoming body penetrates the plates, it closes the [[Electrical network|circuit]] to discharge the capacitor, dumping a great deal of energy into the penetrator, which may vaporize it or even turn it into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], significantly diffusing the attack. It is not public knowledge whether this is supposed to function against both kinetic energy penetrators and shaped charge jets, or only the latter. This technology has not yet been introduced on any known operational platform. 

Another electromagnetic alternative to ERA uses layers of plates of electromagnetic metal with silicone spacers on alternate sides. The damage to the exterior of the armour passes electricity into the plates causing them to magnetically move together. As the process is completed at the [[speed of electricity]] the plates are moving when struck by the projectile causing the projectile energy to be deflected whilst the energy is also dissipated in parting the magnetically attracted plates.

== Directed energy reactive armour ==

Some active protection systems, like the German [[AMAP-ADS]] or the American [[Iron Curtain (countermeasure)|Iron Curtain]], have explosive modules that destroy projectiles with a directed energy explosion. This type of explosive module is similar in concept to the classic ERA, but without the metal plates and with directed energy explosives. The composition materials of the explosive modules are not public. The designer of the AMAP-ADS claims that his AMAP-ADS systems are effective against [[Explosively formed penetrator|EFP]] and [[Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot|APFSDS]].

The objective of security sector reform (SSR) is to achieve good security sector governance (SSG)—where security actors are effective and accountable to their people. For example, SSR might guide decision-making on what form should the oversight of armed forces take or how transparent will intelligence agencies be according to legislation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2151(2014)|title=UN Security Council Resolution 2151 (S/RES/2151) on Security sector reform: challenges and opportunities|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121073122/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S%2FRES%2F2151%282014%29|archivedate=2017-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different nomenclature of the same overall framework include '''security system reform''' ('''SSR'''), '''security sector reconstruction''' ('''SSR''') and '''justice and security sector reform''' ('''JSSR''').&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DCAF_BG_2_Security%20Sector%20Reform.pdf|title=Security Sector Reform: Applying the principles of good governance to the security sector|last=|first=|publisher=DCAF|year=2015|isbn=|series=SSR Backgrounder Series|location=Geneva|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183845/http://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DCAF_BG_2_Security%20Sector%20Reform.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1994, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) adopted a Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security stating that the democratic control of the security sector as essential to stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.osce.org/fsc/41355?download=true|title=Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security|last=|first=|publisher=OSCE|year=1994|isbn=|location=Vienna|pages=3|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829145812/http://www.osce.org/fsc/41355?download=true|archivedate=2017-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A framework for security sector reform (SSR) emerged in 1999 after [[international development]] actors observed from examples in [[South Africa]], [[Indonesia]] and countries in Eastern Europe that national security and its components were considered crucial in a state recovering from [[War|conflict]] or an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian regime]]. Reportedly, the increasing number of [[Civil war|civil wars]] led development actors to look at the problem of insecurity from the perspective of good governance. The conclusion was that the security sector should adhere to the same rules of good governance as any other public service to curb conflict and violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clingendael.nl/publication/ssr-securing-its-success-justifying-its-relevance|title=SSR: Securing its success, justifying its relevance|last=Price|first=Megan|date=2014-08-19|work=Clingendael|access-date=|last2=van Veen|first2=Erwin|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234737/https://www.clingendael.nl/publication/ssr-securing-its-success-justifying-its-relevance|archivedate=2017-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Female police officer of Denmark.jpg|thumb|The [[Service quality|quality of the service]] provided by the police, such as the pictured [[Police of Denmark]], is a component of security sector governance and reform]]There is no single globally accepted definition of security sector reform (SSR), but it generally refers to a process to reform or rebuild a state's [[National security|security sector]] towards good security sector governance (SSG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sites/devco/files/joint-communication-ssr-20160705-p1-854572_en.pdf|title=Elements for an EU-wide strategic framework to support security sector reform, JOIN(2016) 31 final|last=|first=|publisher=European Commission|year=2016|isbn=|location=Strasbourg|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825234526/https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sites/devco/files/joint-communication-ssr-20160705-p1-854572_en.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/115810.pdf|title=Security Sector Reform|last=|first=|publisher=USAID, US Departments of Defense and State|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107024030/https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/115810.pdf|archivedate=2017-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good SSG is usually defined as a number of idealized principles and good practices of a healthy security sector servicing its people. Likewise, the objective of SSR is defined as the application of the same principles of [[good governance]] to the security sector as to any other public sector service delivery, such as [[public health]] or [[education]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dcaf.ch/about-ssgr|title=About SSG/R|last=|first=|date=|website=DCAF (Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces)|language=en|access-date=2017-11-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012716/http://dcaf.ch/about-ssgr|archivedate=2017-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (]]OECD) has defined four standards that SSR should strive for:&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Establishment of effective governance, oversight and accountability in the security system; 2) improved delivery of security and justice services; 3) development of local leadership and ownership of the reform process; and 4) sustainability of justice and security service delivery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The target of SSR are the components of the state that uphold [[national security]]. Although the security sector is therefore a wide term open to interpretation, it is generally used to describe the structures, institutions and personnel responsible for the management, provision and oversight of security in a certain country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/ssr/ssr_perspective_2012.pdf|title=The United Nations SSR Perspective|last=|first=|publisher=UN SSR Unit|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519215426/http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/ssr/ssr_perspective_2012.pdf|archivedate=2017-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the scope and target of SSR has usually been defined comprising the following four groups:
* Core security actors, such as armed forces, police, gendarmerie, border guards, customs and immigration, and intelligence and security services;
* security management and oversight bodies, such as ministries of defence and internal affairs, financial management bodies and public complaints commissions;
* justice and law enforcement institutions, such as the judiciary, prisons, prosecution services, traditional justice systems; and
* non-statutory security forces, such as private security companies, guerrilla armies and private militia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/deza/en/documents/themen/fragile-kontexte/224402-oecd-handbook-security-system-reform_EN.pdf|title=The OECD DAC Handbook on Security System Reform (SSR) - Supporting Security and Justice|last=|first=|publisher=OECD DAC|year=2007|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821172956/https://www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/deza/en/documents/themen/fragile-kontexte/224402-oecd-handbook-security-system-reform_EN.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/%28httpAssets%29/904B9EE812B7591FC12573F400322816/$file/Joint+Seminar_A-62-659_S-2008-39.pdf|title=Securing peace and development: the role of the United Nations in supporting security sector reform - Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/659)|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905032133/http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/904B9EE812B7591FC12573F400322816/$file/Joint+Seminar_A-62-659_S-2008-39.pdf|archivedate=2014-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fba.se/en/how-we-work/security-sector-reform/|title=Security Sector Reform|last=|first=|date=|work=Folke Bernadotte Academy|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826130304/https://fba.se/en/how-we-work/security-sector-reform/|archivedate=2016-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objective ==
[[File:SSG and SSR.png|thumb|A diagram of the relationship between security sector reform and governance relative to time and quality|left]]To observe and measure the quality of SSG as well as set more definite objectives, [[international development]] actors generally break down good security sector governance into different principless that are believed to showcase different subparts of a healthy security sector under democratic control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/resources/what-good-governance|title=What is Good Governance?|last=|first=|date=2009-06-10|website=United Nations ESCAP|language=en|access-date=2017-04-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423153306/http://www.unescap.org/resources/what-good-governance|archivedate=2017-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While exact configurations vary, some of the most common principles or objectives of good SSG that are commonly used include [[accountability]], [[rule of law]], and [[effectiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.osce.org/secretariat/231176|title=Security Sector Governance and Reform: Guidelines for OSCE Staff|last=|first=|publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)|year=2016|isbn=|location=Vienna|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825185357/http://www.osce.org/secretariat/231176|archivedate=2017-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Thomas G.|date=2000-10-01|title=Governance, good governance and global governance: Conceptual and actual challenges|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713701075|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=21|issue=5|pages=795–814|doi=10.1080/713701075|issn=0143-6597}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A multitude of different practical situations of good SSG exist according to development actors: For example, in a security sector lead by good governance, the [[use of force]] is defined by a legal framework. This subsequently requires, among others, that publicly transparent [[law]]s are in place; oversight and [[separation of powers]] mechanisms are established and working; and the state's [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] use of force is regulated through strategies and policies.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An operational level example would be improved and open interaction between the public and the security sector, including functioning [[freedom of information]] and [[complaint]] institutes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

SSR is aimed at the existence of both national security and [[human security]]. However, the goals of providing national and human security can be conflictual in the context of conflict-torn societies which lack the framework of democratic governance. According to Florian Weigand, the experiences of SSR in [[Afghanistan]], for example, have prompted a debate on the advantages of providing human rather than state security in the process of state-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/internationalDevelopment/pdf/WP/WP135.pdf|title=How can security sector reforms contribute to State-Building?

SSR is not understood by researchers to be limited to a single political situation, but rather can be introduced in various contexts. The circumstances under which reform efforts are undertaken are often classified as three different reform environments: post-conflict, [[Provisional government|transitional]] and [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Nevertheless, security sector reform is most commonly introduced in post-conflict settings after [[war]] has ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/security-governance-post-conflict-peacebuilding|title=Security Governance in Post-Conflict Peacebuilding|last=Bryden|first=Alan|last2=Hänggi|first2=Heiner|publisher=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)|year=2005|isbn=978-3-8258-9019-3|location=Geneva|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915024200/http://www.dcaf.ch/security-governance-post-conflict-peacebuilding|archivedate=2017-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its insensitive application to such contexts has raised criticism. For example, Jane Chanaa has argued that there is a concept–context divide because conceptualisation overshadowed the understanding on how the idea adapts to the local situations whereas Safal Ghimire has noted that such a chasm exists also because the 'SSR' concept does not talk about reforms in the benefactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chanaa, Jane.

'''''The Faith of Our Fathers: a Plain Exposition and Vindication of the Church Founded by Our Lord Jesus Christ''''' is a book by archbishop [[James Gibbons]] which was published in Baltimore in 1876,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=0pM77M1OrkrTDGast4&amp;id=uIVNCtk5bSwC&amp;pg=PA3 The Faith of Our Fathers]''&lt;/ref&gt; which became a best-selling conversion manual in the [[United States]] and by 1980 was in its 111th printing. 

In his 1917 preface to the 83rd edition, the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] noted that "since the first edition appeared, in 1876 up to the present time, fourteen hundred thousand copies have been published and the circulation of the book is constantly increasing. The work has been translated into nearly all the [[languages of Europe]]." The well-known agnostic, literary critic and fellow Baltimorean [[H. L. Mencken]] wrote, in his survey of religion ''Treatise on the Gods'', that "the best exposition of [[Catholic]] doctrine is probably ''The Faith of our Fathers''', by the late Cardinal Gibbons."

[[File:The Frythe, Welwyn (without border).png|thumb|The Frythe|350px]]
'''The Frythe''' is a [[country house]] set in its own grounds in rural [[Hertfordshire]], just south of the village of [[Welwyn]], about 30 miles north of [[London]].

==History==
===Early history===
The Frythe was part of the property of [[Holywell Priory, Shoreditch]], and in 1523 William Wilshere obtained a sixty-year lease of the Frythe from the priory. As a result of the [[dissolution of the monasteries]], in 1539 the property was granted to Sir [[John Gostwick]] and Joan his wife. Within ten years, Wilshere had purchased The Frythe from Gostwick's heirs, and the property remained in the possession of the Wilshere family for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43597 |title=''Parishes: Welwyn'', A History of the County of Hertford|volume=3 |year=1912|page=165-171|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present "Gothic revival" mansion was built in 1846 for [[William Wilshere]] (MP for [[Great Yarmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Yarmouth]] from 1837 to 1846). The architects were Thomas Smith and [[Edward Blore]]. After William Wilshere's death in 1867 the house was enlarged by his brother Charles Willes Wilshere who inherited it. In 1908 on Charles Wilshere's death, it passed on to his three unmarried daughters until the last one died in 1934. The estate passed to a great-nephew, Captain Gerald Maunsell Gamul Farmer who ran the house as "The Frythe Residential and Private Hotel".&lt;ref name=knaggs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jefferyknaggs.webspace.virginmedia.com/Frythe.html|title=The Frythe, Welwyn, Hertfordshire|accessdate=6 January 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313105638/http://www.jefferyknaggs.webspace.virginmedia.com/Frythe.html|archivedate=13 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'The Frythe' was commandeered in August 1939 by the British [[Military Intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Timelapse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timelapse.dk/soe.php|title=S.O.E.|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[World War II|Second World War]] it became a secret British [[Special Operations Executive]] factory known as [[Station IX]] making commando equipment. Secret research included military vehicles and equipment, explosives and technical sabotage, [[camouflage]], [[Biological warfare|biological]] and [[chemical warfare]]. In the grounds of The Frythe small cabins and barracks functioned as laboratories and workshops.&lt;ref name="Timelapse"/&gt;

===Research facility===
The Frythe was for many years a commercial research facility, operated by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] from 1946, by [[Unilever]] from 1963 and by [[Smith, Kline &amp; French]] from 1977.&lt;ref name=knaggs/&gt;

====Unilever====
From 1946 to 1963 the site was shared by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] with [[Unilever]].&lt;ref name=knaggs/&gt; New buildings were built by Unilever in the 1960s, with a contract for £400,000 in 1964 to [[Taylor Woodrow]]. Research was conducted on edible oils, margarine, ice cream, and frozen foods in the 1960s. Techniques included [[molecular biophysics]], [[X-ray crystallography]], [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (NMR), [[mass spectrometry]], ESR spectroscopy ([[electron paramagnetic resonance]]), and [[infrared spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=knaggs/&gt;

'''The Primordial Tradition''' is a school of religious philosophy which holds its origins in the [[philosophia perennis]], or [[perennial philosophy]], which is in turn a development of the [[prisca theologia]] of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Faivre and Karen-Claire Voss, Western Esotericism and the Science of Religions, in Numen, Vol. 42 (E. J. Brill, Leiden 1995) 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

The Primordial Tradition seeks to establish a fundamental origin of religious belief in all authentic religious teachings, adhering to the principle that universal truths are a cross cultural phenomenon and transcendent of their respective traditions, mythologies, and religious beliefs. The idea of the Primordial Tradition was well received by both practitioners and the academic community, and its development was actively endorsed by the International Conference of Religions in Chicago, 1893&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Faivre and Karen-Claire Voss, Western Esotericism and the Science of Religions, in Numen, Vol. 42 (E. J. Brill, Leiden 1995) 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The Primordial Tradition does not elevate any tradition or religion above another and instead upholds the truth claims of all authentic religions and spiritual movements. Adherents of the Primordial Tradition can be found in any religious system such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Paganism]], [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]].

By examining the foundations of religious thought as philosophical [[truth value]]s, the Primordial Tradition seeks to produce a level of wisdom or gnosis which is greater than that which would be provided by the study of a single religious system. The process utilized is similar to the study of the [[history of religions]] and [[comparative mythology]] as is found in the works of authors such as [[Mircea Eliade]]. It can also be found in the school of archetypal psychology and in the ideas of [[Carl Jung]]

Key proponents of the Primordial Tradition have included [[Rene Guenon]], [[Frithjof Schuon]], [[Julius Evola]], [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], [[Elémire Zolla]], [[Alain Danielou]], [[Jean-Louis Michon]],  [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Aldous Huxley]], and [[Plato]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The [[Traditionalist School]] bases its teachings on religious belief on the concept of a  pre-existent primordial tradition found in different religions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Unanimous Tradition, Essays on the essential unity of all religions'', by Joseph Epes Brown, Titus Burckhardt, Rama P. Coomaraswamy, Gai Eaton, Isaline B. Horner, Toshihiko Izutsu, Martin Lings, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Lord Northbourne, Marco Pallis, Whitall N. Perry, Leo Schaya, Frithjof Schuon, Philip Sherrard, William Stoddart, Elémire Zolla, edited by Ranjit Fernando, Sri Lanka Institute of Traditional Studies, 1991 {{ISBN|955-9028-01-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''toxidrome''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[toxic]]'' and ''[[syndrome]]'') is a syndrome caused by a dangerous level of [[toxin]]s in the body. The term was coined in 1970 by Mofenson and Greensher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often the consequence of a drug [[overdose]].  Common [[symptom]]s include [[dizziness]], [[disorientation]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[oscillopsia]].  A toxidrome may indicate a [[medical emergency]] requiring treatment at a [[poison control center]].  Aside from [[poison]]ing, a systemic [[infection]] may also lead to a toxidrome.

==Anticholinergic==&lt;!-- section is linked from [[Atropine]] --&gt;
The symptoms of an [[anticholinergic]] toxidrome include blurred vision, [[coma]], decreased [[bowel]] sounds, [[delirium]], dry [[skin]], [[fever]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[hallucination]]s, [[ileus]], [[memory loss]], [[mydriasis]] (dilated [[pupils]]), [[myoclonus]], [[psychosis]], [[seizure]]s, and [[urinary retention]].  [[Complication (medicine)|Complication]]s include [[hypertension]], [[hyperthermia]], and [[tachycardia]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include  [[antihistamine]]s, [[antipsychotic]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, [[antiparkinsonian]] drugs, [[atropine]], [[benztropine]], [[datura]], and [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]].&lt;ref name="firstaid" /&gt;

==Cholinergic==
The symptoms of a cholinergic toxidrome include [[bronchorrhea]], [[confusion]], [[defecation]], [[diaphoresis]], [[diarrhea]], [[emesis]], [[lacrimation]], [[miosis]], [[muscle fasciculation]]s, [[salivation]], [[seizure]]s, [[urination]], and weakness.  Complications include [[bradycardia]], [[hypothermia]], and [[tachypnea]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[carbamate]]s, [[mushroom]]s, and [[organophosphate]]s.

==Hallucinogenic==
The symptoms of a hallucinogenic toxidrome include [[disorientation]], [[hallucination]]s, hyperactive bowel sounds, [[panic]], and [[seizure]]s.  Complications include [[hypertension]], [[tachycardia]], and [[tachypnea]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[substituted amphetamine]]s, [[cocaine]], and [[phencyclidine]].

==Opiate==
The symptoms of an opiate toxidrome include the classic triad of [[coma]], [[miosis|pinpoint pupils]], and [[hypoventilation|respiratory depression]]&lt;ref name = firstaid/&gt; as well as [[Altered state of consciousness|altered mental state]]s, [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], [[pulmonary edema]] and unresponsiveness.  Complications include [[bradycardia]], [[hypotension]], and [[hypothermia]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome are [[opioids]].

==Sedative/hypnotic==
The symptoms of sedative/hypnotic toxidrome include [[ataxia]], blurred vision, [[coma]], [[confusion]], [[delirium]], deterioration of [[central nervous system]] functions, [[diplopia]], [[dysesthesias]], [[hallucination]]s, [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[paresthesias]], [[sedation]], slurred speech, and [[stupor]].  [[Apnea]] is a potential complication.  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[anticonvulsant]]s, [[barbiturate]]s, [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid]], [[Methaqualone]], and [[ethanol]]. While most sedative-hypnotics are [[anticonvulsant]], some such as GHB and methaqualone instead lower the seizure threshold, and so can cause paradoxical [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] in overdose.

==Sympathomimetic==
The symptoms of a sympathomimetic toxidrome include [[anxiety]], [[delusion]]s, [[diaphoresis]], [[hyperreflexia]], [[mydriasis]], [[paranoia]], [[piloerection]], and [[seizure]]s.  Complications include [[hypertension]], and [[tachycardia]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[salbutamol]], [[amphetamine]]s, [[cocaine]], [[ephedrine]] ([[Ma Huang]]), [[methamphetamine]], [[phenylpropanolamine]] (PPA's), and [[pseudoephedrine]]. It may appear very similar to the anticholinergic toxidrome, but is distinguished by hyperactive bowel sounds and sweating.&lt;ref name = firstaid/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1964">In [[actor-network theory]] (ANT), '''translation''' is the process that allows a network to be represented by a single entity, which can in itself be an individual or another network.&lt;ref&gt;Callon, M. &amp; Latour, B., 1981.

In 1986, [[Michel Callon]] published the seminal article [http://www.vub.ac.be/SOCO/tesa/RENCOM/Callon%20%281986%29%20Some%20elements%20of%20a%20sociology%20of%20translation.pdf "Some elements of a sociology of translation"],&lt;ref&gt;Callon, M., 1986.

London: Macmillan, p. 19–34.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he summarized the process of translation as four 'moments' or phases:

# [[Problematization]] - the definition of the nature of the problem in a specific situation by an actor (a group or an individual) and the consequential establishment of dependency
# [[Interessement]] - "locking" other actors into the roles that were proposed for them in the actor's &lt;!--approach/--&gt;programme for resolving that problem
# [[Enrolment (sociology)|Enrolment]] - the definition and interrelation of the roles that were allocated to other actors in the previous step
# [[Mobilization (translation)|Mobilization]] - ensuring that supposed spokespersons for relevant collective entities are properly representative of all members of the network that are acting as a single agent.

:''For the [[Pitchshifter (band)|Pitchshifter]] song, see [[Underachiever (song)]]. For the hip hop duo, see [[The Underachievers]].''

An '''underachiever''' is a person who fails to achieve his or her [[potential]] or does not do as well as expected.{{by whom?|date=November 2012}}

Of particular interest is '''academic underachievement'''.  Studies of individuals who have not realized their apparent potential have identified [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], and many other educational problems, and subsequently enabled methods of addressing these problems.  Current theories among academic scholars prefer to address underperformance problems with remedial help.  

The term is also used more generally; for example, a sports team that contains many star players but still loses games against teams with relatively little obvious talent might be termed underachieving. A [[stock]] which achieves poor [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] and/or [[capital gain]]s despite sound underlying business and/or [[asset]]s may be called underachieving.

==Examples of usage==
  
The [[marketer]] Matt Bailey described it as "a desire to see something done, but not enough desire to make it happen".&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Matt Bailey, "Viral marketing", excerpt "Analytics 1.0 - A Case of Velleity," found at [http://www.sitelogicmarketing.com/blog/07-analytics-velleity Site Logic marketing website].  Accessed April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern writing===

Matt Bailey expressed an attempt "to bring it back, as it has more relevance now than ever."&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt;  He writes that:
{{quote|Velleity is what keeps companies locked in this mindset of reporting useless numbers. Desiring, even expecting to someday have an epiphany of change, but not willing to change the mindset or the culture of locked-in reporting to achieve it. Nor are they willing to ask the hard questions in order to uncover what must be done.|Matt Bailey, marketing writer&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt;}}

===In philosophy===

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] describes the velleity of an [[artist]] as a "desire to ''be'' 'what he is able to represent, conceive, and express'...."&lt;ref&gt;
Aaron Ridley, in "Nietzsche, philosophy and the arts," ed. by Salim Kemal, Ivan Gaskell, Daniel W. Conway, at pp. 128-131 (Cambridge University Press, 2002) {{ISBN|0-521-52272-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-52272-4}} (emphasis provided), found at [https://books.google.com/books?id=8GzFg3pH4SIC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=Velleity+%2B+philosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MljPsygceA&amp;sig=SWt2zXpiLVhU9oBymK3jfNIAKQs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TrH4SfCODNOGmQeOj-GYDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#PPA134,M1 Google Book search]. Accessed April 29, 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Nietzsche championed the [[will to power]], which can be encapsulated{{by whom?|date=November 2012}} as starting with velleity, in his [[free-will theorem]].

Keith David Wyma refers frequently to the "concept of velleity", citing [[Thomas Aquinas]] as a pioneer of introducing the idea into philosophy.&lt;ref name=Wyma&gt;
Keith David Wyma, ''Crucible of reason'', pp. 197, 221, 223, 225, 227 (Rowman and Littlefield 2004).  {{ISBN|978-0-7425-3538-1}}.

===In psychology===
{{Main|Volition (psychology)}}
Psychologist Avi Sion writes, "''Many psychological concepts may only be defined and explained with reference to velleity''." (''Emphasis in original''.)&lt;ref name=Sion&gt;Avi Sion, "Volition and allied causal concepts," p. 190 (2004). {{ISBN|978-2-9700091-6-0}}.

Also found at [http://www.thelogician.net/4b_volition/4b_chapter_09.htm The Logician website].  All accessed June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example he cites is that "an ordinarily desirable object can only properly be called 'interesting' or 'tempting' to that [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] at that time, if he manifests some velleity...."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;
He distinguishes between the two types of velleity - "''to do'' something and one ''not to do'' something...."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;  Furthermore, he asserts, "The concept of velleity is also important because it enables us to understand the co-existence of conflicting values."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;  A person could thus have "double velleity" or "a mix of velleity for something and a volition for its opposite: the latter dominates, of course, but that does not erase the fact of velleity."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;

Kathy Kolbe also lists velleity as a "key concept of [[conation]]."&lt;ref name=Kolbe&gt;See [http://www.kolbe.com/knol/keyConceptsOfConation.htm Kathy Kolbe's website page on Conation].  Accessed June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
