'''''35 Bar and Grille LLC, et al. v. The City of San Antonio''''' was a court case in U.S. District court. The case addressed a city ordinance about the amount of bodily coverage needed by [[semi-nude dancer]]s in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. The case reached notoriety in international press when the press discovered that Chief U.S. District Judge [[Fred Biery]]'s April 29, 2013 order denying a motion for a preliminary injunction was full of puns and [[double entendre]]s about stripping and sexuality. During its press coverage, the case was also known by the humorous title applied to the judge's opinion of the case, '''''The Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Bikini Top v The (More) Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Pastie''''' (a reference to the song "[[Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini]]").&lt;ref name = Telegraph&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10030421/The-Itsy-Bitsy-Teeny-Weeny-Bikini-opinion-Texas-judge-issues-worlds-cheekiest-written-ruling.html | newspaper = The Telegraph (UK)| title =The Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Bikini opinion: Texas judge issues world's cheekiest written ruling| first = Daniel|last =  Easterman | date = 1 May 2013| accessdate = 2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 2012, the city of San Antonio amended its city ordinances dealing with "[[sexually oriented business]]es", or SOBs. Among other changes, the amendment redefined "nudity" to include "a state of dress that fails to completely and opaquely cover...the entire female breast".&lt;ref name=law&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.municode.com/index.aspx?clientId=11508|accessdate=3 May 2013|title=Chapter 21, Article IX|work=San Antonio, Texas, Code of Ordinances|publisher=Municode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas female dancers had previously been able to avoid being classified as "nude" by wearing [[pasties]] over their nipples, the new law required that they wear at minimum a [[Brassiere|bra]] or [[bikini]] top.&lt;ref name=kv&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kvue.com/news/state/182534241.html |author=Conger, Joe |title=San Antonio city hall redefines 'sexually-oriented business' |date=7 December 2012 |publisher=KVUE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505145227/http://www.kvue.com/news/state/182534241.html |archivedate=2013-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any business not meeting that requirement had to seek a permit as a SOB.&lt;ref name=law/&gt; The law also augmented fines associated with failure to comply with these regulations.&lt;ref name=kv/&gt;

The amendments were proposed to address concerns from parents about the proximity of semi-nude dance clubs to schools.&lt;ref name=kv/&gt; Police Chief Bill McManus applauded the amendment because it simplified enforcement by eliminating legal "grey areas"; he also noted connections between the presence of such establishments and area crime rates.&lt;ref name=ks&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ksat.com/news/Sexually-oriented-business-amendments-approved-by-SA-City-Council/-/478452/17684814/-/13fqyvz/-/index.html|date=6 December 2012|publisher=KSAT|author=Venema, Paul|title=Sexually oriented business amendments passed by SA City Council|access-date=2013-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620105717/http://www.ksat.com/news/Sexually-oriented-business-amendments-approved-by-SA-City-Council/-/478452/17684814/-/13fqyvz/-/index.html|archive-date=2013-06-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[strip club]]s objected on the grounds that no consultation or public hearings had taken place prior to the amendments being passed.&lt;ref name=ks/&gt; Richard Deegear, a lawyer representing several establishments, noted that "This entire process has been a disappointment because there hasn't been any process to speak of" and stated that he intended to bring the matter to court.&lt;ref name=ks/&gt; Previous attempts by the city in 2005 to regulate these business had also been challenged in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://radio.woai.com/pages/localnews.html?feed=119078&amp;article=10614210|publisher=WOAI|date=4 December 2012|title=City to try again to regulate strip clubs|access-date=2013-05-03|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630161854/http://radio.woai.com/pages/localnews.html?feed=119078&amp;article=10614210|archive-date=2013-06-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings==
A case challenging the amendments was filed against the city on 11 January 2013 in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas]]. The plaintiffs in the case were: 35 Bar and Grille, LLC; C. B. Restaurants, Inc.; E &amp; I Enterprises, Inc.; Endless Music, LLC; FLWW, Inc.; Hacienda Club, LLC; KHG of San Antonio; Michael D's Restaurant San Antonio, Inc.; RCI Entertainment (San Antonio), Inc.; Sacolo, LTD.; Spiros Partnership, Ltd.; Tripolis Enterprises, Inc.; and the Players Club, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/texas/txwdce/5:2013cv00034/600906/|accessdate=3 May 2013|title=35 Bar and Grille LLC, et. al. v. The City of San Antonio, Texas|publisher=Justia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was assigned to Chief U.S. District Judge [[Fred Biery]] in February 2013. Biery had previously presided over a 2003 case involving nude dancing.&lt;ref name=current&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.sacurrent.com/news/newsmonger-strip-club-regs-stalled-military-still-mishandling-sexual-assault-reports-1.1439915|date=8 February 2013|work=San Antonio Current|author=Barajas, Michael|title=Newsmonger: Strip-club regs still stalled, military still mishandling sexual assault reports|access-date=2013-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210153916/http://m.sacurrent.com/news/newsmonger-strip-club-regs-stalled-military-still-mishandling-sexual-assault-reports-1.1439915|archive-date=2013-02-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plaintiffs argued that the amendments violated their [[first amendment]] right to [[free speech in the United States|free speech]]. They also complained that forcing their dancers to be more covered would reduce the [[profit margin]] of their companies.&lt;ref name=fix&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsfixnow.com/2013/05/01/federal-judge-rules-san-antonio-strippers-must-wear-bikini-tops/|accessdate=3 May 2013|title=Federal judge warns San Antonio strippers must wear bikini tops|publisher=NewsFix}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sought an injunction against enforcement of the ordinance.&lt;ref name=kabb&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsanantonio.com/newsroom/top_stories/videos/vid_15239.shtml|date=29 April 2013|publisher=KABB Fox|author=Virgin, Yami|title=Bikini tops or pasties?|access-date=2013-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503080818/http://foxsanantonio.com/newsroom/top_stories/videos/vid_15239.shtml|archive-date=2013-05-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early February, Biery issued an order that the city not enforce the ordinance until the request for injunction was considered at a hearing.&lt;ref name=current/&gt;

===Decision===
On 29 April 2013, Judge Biery issued a decision denying the request for an injunction.&lt;ref name=kabb/&gt; He found that the plaintiffs had not met the burden of proof to justify an injunction.{{sfn|Biery|2013|pp=5&amp;ndash;6}} His decision included a loose paraphrase of the Bible and other works of literature (for example ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'') and a photograph of "Miss Wiggles", a 1960s-era clothed exotic dancer, in addition to the usual case references.{{sfn|Biery|2013|pp=1, 3, 7}} The decision concluded "Should the parties choose to [[G-string|string]] this case out to trial on the merits, the Court encourages reasonable discovery [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] as they navigate the peaks and valleys of litigation, perhaps to reach a [[:wikt:happy ending|happy ending]]".{{sfn|Biery|2013|p=8}}

When discussing the importance of the argument, despite its playfulness, the press described the opinion as highlighting important problems in American society.&lt;ref name = Telegraph/&gt; In particular, Biery's opinion also highlighted the problems inherent with the assumptions from lawmakers about stemming crime related to Sexually Oriented Businesses writing:&lt;ref name = HP/&gt;
{{quote|While the court finds these businesses to be nefarious magnets of mischief, the court doubts several square inches of fabric will stanch the flow of violence and other secondary effects emanating from these businesses. Indeed, this case exposes the underbelly of America's Romanesque passion for entertainment, sex and money, sought to be covered with constitutional prophylaxis.}}

==Response==

In the press following the ruling, many newspapers commented on the humor and amount of careful use of suggestive language within the opinion. [[The Daily Telegraph|''The Telegraph'']] called the case "world's cheekiest written ruling".&lt;ref name =Telegraph/&gt; Similarly the [[Huffington Post]] business section called the case "one of the funniest, most eloquent court documents we've ever seen."&lt;ref name = HP&gt;{{cite news| title = Texas Judge's Order Upholding 'Bikini Tops For Strippers' Law Is Completely Hilarious| newspaper =The Huffington Post| first =Hunter|last = Stuart| date = April 30, 2013| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/30/texas-judge-bikini-strippers_n_3186442.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawyer representing the strip clubs expressed a similar opinion to the press when talking about the ruling telling local press "one of the most entertaining things I've ever seen".&lt;ref name = Telegraph/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1440">In 1865, at [[Boston, Massachusetts]], a society for the study of social questions was organized and given the name  '''American Social Science Association'''. The group grew to where its membership totaled about 1,000 persons. About 30 corresponding members were located in [[Europe]].  It published annually the  ''[[Journal of Social Science]]''.  

Members of the group worked in five departments:  
* Education and art
* Health
* Trade and finance
* Social economy
* Jurisprudence

In 1898, the society founded the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] which developed into the [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters|American Academy of Arts and Letters]].

'''Antiques restoration''' is restoring an [[antique]] or work of [[art]] to a like-new condition, or preserving an antique or work of art against further deterioration as in [[art conservation|conservation]].

==Restoration==

Restoration can be as simple as light cleaning to remove disfiguring dirt or grime, such as on the surface of a painting, or it may include near complete rebuilding or replacement, as might be the case with old [[automobile]]s or [[furniture]]. Often done in preparation for sale, or by a [[art collector|collector]] upon acquiring a new piece, the main goal of restoration is to "restore" the original appearance or functionality of a piece.

There is a lot of difference between restoring and repairing. Functionality may be achieved by a repair, but restoring an item properly is an art-form. Finishes might/may be stripped and redone, but it is essential that the original [[patina]]tion is retained, if possible. Stripping is only done as a last resort, especially with antique furniture. Engines might be rebuilt with new parts as necessary, or holes in a silver pot might/may be patched. While some of these practices are frowned on by many museums, scholars, and other experts, for many people{{fact|date=December 2015}} there is little value in an antique that is unusable or not able to be displayed. Poor restoration is the bane of a trained restorer. Working on someone else's bad repair is the worst possible situation. Often with antique restoration, there are also other issues as well. For example, some collectors value "patina", or also want an item to still reflect an aesthetic that shows its age- in this respect, an "over restored" item can actually take away from its value than if nothing has been done to the item at all. Therefore, restoration of valuable objects should always be left to professionals who are sensitive to all of the issues, ensuring that a piece retains or increases its value after restoration.

Original artwork can sustain all sorts of damage over its lifetime. Conservatorshave an obligation to the artwork to recommend the best techniques for preserving it for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiebold.com/paintings_and_frames "Paintings and Frames"] 2000-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Restorers are often trained craftspersons, such as furniture makers, [[mechanic]]s, or [[smith (metalwork)|metalsmiths]]. Some have years of experience in their fields, whereas others are self-taught volunteers. Many of the antique aircraft around the [[United States]] are restored by trained aircraft engineers assisted by volunteers, some of whom are men who flew those same aircraft years ago.

Given that a single piece of furniture may include wood, glass, inlay, leather and fabric, antique restoration encompasses several skills. Caldararo estimates that 90 percent of USA restorers are self-taught, or cobble together their skills from idiosyncratic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Davis Kho. [http://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/article/Restoring-antiques-a-nearly-lost-art-3253209.php "Restoring antiques a nearly lost art."] ''San Francisco Chronicle''. January 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[French polish|French Polishing]]" was the industry standard in [[Europe]] during the 18th and 19th centuries, pushed aside by the efficient advantage of modern methods in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. [[Lacquer]]s and spray systems replaced the original French polish finish, which is impractical for mass furniture production due to the labor-intensive process of application. As the desire for antiques was not idle, neither was the need for them to be appropriately restored; thus, the trade has been kept alive by a thread.

===Restoration terminology===
*[[Conservation-restoration|Conservation]]: Detail-oriented process designed to preserve as much original finish and materials as possible while bringing the piece back to as close to its original condition as possible.
*[[Finish restoration]]: Finish restoration is the process of bringing an existing finish back to life. This involves re-emulsifying the original finish, either shellac or varnish. By using the original solvents to liquefy the solids, their ability to adhere to and penetrate the piece returns. The process also removes the dirt and grime accumulated over years of use. If the finish is very thin, additional layers of the same finish may be applied to bolster the restored finish and ensure longevity. Finish restoration results in an original finish rating: for example, 85% of the original finish remains. The more original finish that remains, the more antique value remains.
*[[Historic preservation|Preservation]]: The process of stopping or slowing deterioration usually does not involve actual restoration or attempts to return the piece to its original condition. Damage and finish deterioration are left intact, but prevented from going further. This process is usually done on museum works; we recommend a conservation or restoration process for home use of antiques. In most cases this is a chemical process that prevents further oxidation of the wood and metals, and in addition adds moister to the existing finish. 
*[[Refinishing]]: Removing a finish and applying a new finish in its place. This process destroys significant portions of antique value in furniture and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. 
*[[Repair]]: Physical structural replacement or reinforcement of parts of the original piece. May involve addition of new materials altered to appear aged or the application of antique materials to improve appearance of repair and preserve as much value as possible. 
*[[Art restoration|Restoration]]: Bringing a piece back to close to its original condition including structural and finish repairs. 
*[[Paint stripper|Stripping]]:  stripping involves dipping the piece in a chemical bath that will remove finish, patina, and in some cases the glue holding the piece together.&lt;ref&gt;Eric &amp; Stanley Saperstein [http://www.artisansofthevalley.com/docs/the_philosophy_of_restoration.pdf "The Philosophy of Restoration"] December 2002 page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salvage==
On the other extreme, though most bad old pieces were thrown away long ago, there are pieces that, because of their original design or workmanship or because of damage, are not worth restoring but that are made of re-usable materials such as hard wood, amber, pewter or ivory.  As the number of people increases and the number of trees and other natural products in the world decreases, wood and other materials becomes more scarce.  So the fact that the material was not worth doing a good job with when an item was made does not mean that the material should be discarded along with the object now.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10130">The '''behavioral immune system''' is a phrase coined by the psychological scientist [[Mark Schaller]] to refer to a suite of psychological mechanisms that allow individual organisms to detect the potential presence of disease-causing [[parasite]]s in their immediate environment, and to engage in behaviors that prevent contact with those objects and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1702_2 |last=Schaller |first=M. |year=2006 |title=Parasites, behavioral defenses, and the social psychological mechanisms through which cultures are evoked |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages= 96–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sd2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Duncan, L.A. |title=Evolution and the social mind: Evolutionary psychology and social cognition |editor=J.P. Forgas, M.G. Haselton &amp; W. von Hippel |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=293–307 |chapter=The behavioral immune system: Its evolution and social psychological implications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0963721411402596 |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Park, J.H. |year=2011 |title=The behavioral immune system (and why it matters) |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=99–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These mechanisms include sensory processes through which cues connoting the presence of parasitic infections are perceived (e.g., the smell of a foul odor, the sight of [[Acne scarring|pox]] or [[pustules]]), as well as [[stimulus–response]] systems through which these sensory cues trigger a cascade of aversive affective, cognitive, and behavioral reactions (e.g., arousal of [[disgust]], automatic activation of cognitions that connote the threat of disease, behavioral avoidance).&lt;ref name="sd2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oaten |first=M. |author2=Stevenson, R.J. |author3=Case, T.I. |date=March 2009 |title=Disgust as a disease–avoidance mechanism |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=303–21 |doi=10.1037/a0014823 |pmid=19254082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of a behavioral immune system has been documented across many animal species, including humans. It is theorized that the mechanisms that comprise the behavioral immune system evolved as a crude first line of defense against disease-causing pathogens.&lt;ref name="sd2007"/&gt;

==Implications for human behavior==
Within the [[psychological sciences]], there is extensive research linking the behavioral immune system to a variety of prejudices—including prejudices against people who aren't actually diseased but are simply characterized by some sort of visual characteristics that deviate from those of a subjectively prototypical human being. The disease–avoidant processes that characterize the behavioral immune system have been shown to contribute to prejudices against [[obese]] individuals, [[elderly]] individuals, and people with physical disfigurements or [[disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Park |first=J.H. |author2=Faulkner, J. |author3=Schaller, M. |date=June 2003 |title=Evolved disease-avoidance processes and contemporary anti-social behavior: Prejudicial attitudes and avoidance of people with physical disabilities |journal= Journal of Nonverbal Behavior |publisher=Springer Netherlands |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=65–87 |issn=1573-3653 |doi=10.1023/A:1023910408854 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l147k15h81282134/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Park |first=J. |author2=Schaller, M. |author3=Crandall, C.S. |year=2007 |title=Pathogen-avoidance mechanisms and the stigmatization of obese people |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=410–4 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/ParkSchallerCrandall2007.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duncan |first=L.A. |author2=Schaller, M. |date=October 27, 2009 |title=Prejudicial Attitudes Toward Older Adults May Be Exaggerated When People Feel Vulnerable to Infectious Disease: Evidence and Implications |journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy |publisher=The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=97–115 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122665436/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2009.01188.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the behavioral immune system appears to contribute to [[xenophobia]] and [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faulkner |first=J. |author2=Schaller, M. |author3=Park, J.H. |author4= Duncan, L.A.  |year=2004 |title=Evolved Disease–Avoidance Mechanisms and Contemporary Xenophobic Attitudes |journal=Group Processes and Intergroup Relations |volume=7 |issue=4 |doi=10.1177/1368430204046142 |pages=333–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Navarrete |first=C.D. |author2=D. Fessler|author3=S. Eng |year=2007 |title=Elevated ethnocentrism in the first trimester of pregnancy |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=60–5 |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fessler/pubs/NavarretePregEthnocentr2007.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2006.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; One implication is that these prejudices tend to be exaggerated under conditions in which people feel especially vulnerable to the potential transmission of infectious diseases.

Additional lines of research on the behavioral immune system have shown that people engage in more reticent and conservative forms of behavior under conditions in which they feel more vulnerable to disease transmission. For instance, when the potential threat of disease is made salient, people tend to be less extraverted or sociable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0956797610361706 |last=Mortensen |first=C.R. |author2=Becker, D.V. |author3=Ackerman, J.M. |author4=Neuberg, S.L. |author5=Kenrick, D.T. |year=2010 |title=Infection breeds reticence: The effects of disease salience on self-perceptions of personality and behavioral tendencies |journal=Psychological Science |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=440–7 |pmid=20424082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that the behavioral immune system also incorporates mechanisms designed to search out and process (heuristic) signs of disease at the level of basic visual attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.12.008 |last=Ackerman |first=J.M. |author2=Becker, D.V. |author3=Mortensen, C.R. |author4=Sasaki, T. |author5=Neuberg, S.L.  |author6=Kenrick, D.T. |year=2009 |title=A pox on the mind: Disjunction of attention and memory in the processing of physical disfigurement |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages= 478–85 |url=http://web.mit.edu/joshack/www/Ackerman_Pox-on-the-mind2009.pdf |pmid=19578547 |pmc=2699287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for human culture==
The behavioral immune system also has consequences at a [[cultural]] level of analysis. Under ecological circumstances in which diseases are more prevalent, people also tend to display more reticent and socially restricted forms of behavior, and human cultures are defined by more conservative norms and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fincher |first=C.L. |author2=Thornhill, R. |author3=Murray, D.R. |author4= Schaller, M.  |year=2008 |title=Pathogen prevalence predicts human cross-cultural variability in individualism/collectivism |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=275 |issue=1640 |pages=1279–85 |pmid=18302996 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/FincherThornhillMurraySchaller2008.pdf |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0094 |pmc=2602680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Murray, D.R. |date=July 2008 |title=Pathogens, personality, and culture: Disease prevalence predicts worldwide variability in sociosexuality, extraversion, and openness to experience |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=212–21 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2008-08084-014&amp;CFID=5418322&amp;CFTOKEN=19787463 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.1.212 |pmid=18605861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for immunology==
Some research suggests that the behavioral immune system has implications for the functioning of the physiological [[immune system]] too. One study found that the mere visual perception of diseased-looking people stimulated white blood cells to respond more aggressively to infection (as indicated by the production of the proinflammatory [[cytokine]] [[Interleukin 6]] in response to a bacterial stimulus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Miller, G.E. |author3=Gervais, W.M. |author4=Yager, S. |author5= Chen, E.  |year=2010 |title=Mere visual perception of other people's disease symptoms facilitates a more aggressive immune response |journal=Psychological Science |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=649–52 |pmid=20483842 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/SchallerMillerGervaisYagerChen2010.pdf |doi=10.1177/0956797610368064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also indicates that immune-relevant interventions which target pathogen transmission can interrupt behavioral responses. For example, receiving a flu vaccination or washing one's hands can reduce the extent of negative interpersonal and intergroup attitudes elicited by disease cues and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huang|first=J.Y. |author2=Sedlovskaya, A. |author3=Ackerman, J.M. |author4= Bargh, J.A.  |year=2011 |title=Immunizing Against Prejudice: Effects of Disease Protection on Attitudes Toward Out-Groups |journal=Psychological Science |volume=22 |issue=12 |pages=1550–56 |pmid=22058107 |doi=10.1177/0956797611417261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''calligram''' is a text visually arranged in a way that it forms an image associated with the text's contents. It can be a [[Poetry|poem]], a phrase, a portion of [[scripture]], or a single word; the visual arrangement can rely on certain use of the [[typeface]], [[calligraphy]] or [[handwriting]], for instance along non-parallel and curved text lines, or in shaped paragraphs. The image created by the words illustrates the text by expressing visually what it says, or something closely associated; it can also, on purpose, show something contradictory with the text or otherwise misleading.

[[Guillaume Apollinaire]] was a famous calligram writer and author of a book of poems called ''[[Calligrammes]]''.

A '''cellular automaton''' (pl. '''cellular automata''', abbrev. '''CA''') is a [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] model studied in [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[complexity science]], [[theoretical biology]] and [[microstructure]] modeling. Cellular automata are also called '''cellular spaces''', '''tessellation automata''', '''homogeneous structures''', '''cellular structures''', '''tessellation structures''', and '''iterative arrays'''.&lt;ref name=reviews&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/articles/ca/83-statistical/ | author=Wolfram, Stephen | authorlink=Stephen Wolfram | title=Statistical Mechanics of Cellular Automata | journal=Reviews of Modern Physics | issue=3 | volume=55 | pages=601–644 | year=1983 | doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.55.601 | bibcode=1983RvMP...55..601W | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of ''cells'', each in one of a finite number of ''[[State (computer science)|states]]'', such as ''on'' and ''off'' (in contrast to a [[coupled map lattice]]). The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. For each cell, a set of cells called its ''neighborhood'' is defined relative to the specified cell. An initial state (time ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell. A new ''generation'' is created (advancing ''t'' by 1), according to some fixed ''rule'' (generally, a mathematical function)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cellular Automata Machines: A New Environment for Modeling|first1=Tommaso|last1=Toffoli|first2=Norman|last2=Margolus|publisher=MIT Press|year=1987|isbn=9780262200608|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBlJzrBKUTEC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt; that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood. Typically, the rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell and does not change over time, and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Schiff, Joel L. | title=Cellular Automata: A Discrete View of the World | year=2011 | publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc | isbn=9781118030639 | ref=schiff|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXJC2C2sRbIC&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt; though exceptions are known, such as the [[stochastic cellular automaton]] and [[asynchronous cellular automaton]].

The concept was originally discovered in the 1940s by [[Stanislaw Ulam]] and [[John von Neumann]] while they were contemporaries at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. While studied by some throughout the 1950s and 1960s, it was not until the 1970s and [[Conway's Game of Life]], a two-dimensional cellular automaton, that interest in the subject expanded beyond academia. In the 1980s, [[Stephen Wolfram]] engaged in a systematic study of one-dimensional cellular automata, or what he calls [[elementary cellular automaton|elementary cellular automata]]; his research assistant [[Matthew Cook]] showed that one of these rules is [[Turing-complete]]. Wolfram published ''[[A New Kind of Science]]'' in 2002, claiming that cellular automata have applications in many fields of science. These include computer processors and [[cryptography]].

The primary classifications of cellular automata, as outlined by Wolfram, are numbered one to four. They are, in order, automata in which patterns generally stabilize into [[homogeneity]], automata in which patterns evolve into mostly stable or oscillating structures, automata in which patterns evolve in a seemingly chaotic fashion, and automata in which patterns become extremely complex and may last for a long time, with stable local structures.  This last class are thought to be [[computationally universal]], or capable of simulating a [[Turing machine]]. Special types of cellular automata are ''reversible'', where only a single configuration leads directly to a subsequent one, and ''totalistic'', in which the future value of individual cells only depends on the total value of a group of neighboring cells. Cellular automata can simulate a variety of real-world systems, including biological and chemical ones.

One way to simulate a two-dimensional cellular automaton is with an infinite sheet of [[graph paper]] along with a set of rules for the cells to follow. Each square is called a "cell" and each cell has two possible states, black and white. The ''neighborhood'' of a cell is the nearby, usually adjacent, cells. The two most common types of neighborhoods are the ''[[von Neumann neighborhood]]'' and the ''[[Moore neighborhood]]''.&lt;ref name=kier-seybold-cheng-15&gt;{{Harvnb|Kier, Seybold, Cheng|2005|p=15|ref=kier-seybold-cheng}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former, named after the founding cellular automaton theorist, consists of the four [[orthogonal]]ly adjacent cells.&lt;ref name=kier-seybold-cheng-15/&gt; The latter includes the von Neumann neighborhood as well as the four remaining cells surrounding the cell whose state is to be calculated.&lt;ref name=kier-seybold-cheng-15/&gt; For such a cell and its Moore neighborhood, there are 512 (= 2&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) possible patterns. For each of the 512 possible patterns, the rule table would state whether the center cell will be black or white on the next time interval. [[Conway's Game of Life]] is a popular version of this model. Another common neighborhood type is the ''extended von Neumann neighborhood'', which includes the two closest cells in each orthogonal direction, for a total of eight.&lt;ref name=kier-seybold-cheng-15/&gt; The general equation for such a system of rules is ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''k'' is the number of possible states for a cell, and ''s'' is the number of neighboring cells (including the cell to be calculated itself) used to determine the cell's next state.&lt;ref name=bialynick-9&gt;{{Harvnb|Bialynicki-Birula, Bialynicka-Birula|2004|p=9|ref=bialynick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the two dimensional system with a Moore neighborhood, the total number of automata possible would be 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or {{val|1.34|e=154}}.

It is usually assumed that every cell in the universe starts in the same state, except for a finite number of cells in other states; the assignment of state values is called a ''configuration''.&lt;ref name=schiff-41&gt;{{Harvnb|Schiff|2011|p=41|ref=schiff}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, it is sometimes assumed that the universe starts out covered with a periodic pattern, and only a finite number of cells violate that pattern. The latter assumption is common in one-dimensional cellular automata.

[[File:Torus.png|thumb|right|A [[torus]], a toroidal shape]]
Cellular automata are often simulated on a finite grid rather than an infinite one. In two dimensions, the universe would be a rectangle instead of an infinite plane. The obvious problem with finite grids is how to handle the cells on the edges. How they are handled will affect the values of all the cells in the grid. One possible method is to allow the values in those cells to remain constant. Another method is to define neighborhoods differently for these cells. One could say that they have fewer neighbors, but then one would also have to define new rules for the cells located on the edges. These cells are usually handled with a ''toroidal'' arrangement: when one goes off the top, one comes in at the corresponding position on the bottom, and when one goes off the left, one comes in on the right. (This essentially simulates an infinite periodic tiling, and in the field of [[partial differential equations]] is sometimes referred to as ''periodic'' boundary conditions.) This can be visualized as taping the left and right edges of the rectangle to form a tube, then taping the top and bottom edges of the tube to form a [[torus]] (doughnut shape). Universes of other [[dimensions]] are handled similarly. This solves boundary problems with neighborhoods, but another advantage is that it is easily programmable using [[modular arithmetic]] functions. For example, in a 1-dimensional cellular automaton like the examples below, the neighborhood of a cell ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' is {''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup style="margin-left:-2ex;"&gt;''t''−1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''t''−1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup style="margin-left:-2ex;"&gt;''t''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}, where ''t'' is the time step (vertical), and ''i'' is the index (horizontal) in one generation.

==History==

[[Stanislaw Ulam]], while working at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in the 1940s, studied the growth of crystals, using a simple [[Lattice model (physics)|lattice network]] as his model.&lt;ref name=pickover&gt;{{cite book | author=Pickover, Clifford A. | title=The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics | page=406 | year=2009| publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc | isbn=978-1402757969}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[John von Neumann]], Ulam's colleague at Los Alamos, was working on the problem of [[self-replicating system]]s.&lt;ref name=schiff-1&gt;{{Harvnb|Schiff|2011|p=1|ref=schiff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann's initial design was founded upon the notion of one robot building another robot. This design is known as the kinematic model.&lt;ref&gt;John von Neumann, "The general and logical theory of automata," in [[Lloyd A. Jeffress|L.A. Jeffress]], ed., Cerebral Mechanisms in Behavior – The Hixon Symposium, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1951, pp. 1–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kemeny | first1 = John G. | year = 1955 | title = Man viewed as a machine | url = | journal = Sci. Am. | volume = 192 | issue = 4| pages = 58–67 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0455-58| bibcode = 1955SciAm.192d..58K}}; ''Sci. Am.'' 1955; 192:6 (errata).&lt;/ref&gt; As he developed this design, von Neumann came to realize the great difficulty of building a self-replicating robot, and of the great cost in providing the robot with a "sea of parts" from which to build its replicant. Neumann wrote a paper entitled "The general and logical theory of automata" for the [[Lloyd A. Jeffress#The Hixon Symposium|Hixon Symposium]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=schiff-1/&gt; Ulam was the one who suggested using a ''discrete'' system for creating a reductionist model of self-replication.&lt;ref name=schiff-3&gt;{{Harvnb|Schiff|2011|p=3|ref=schiff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ilachinski-xxix&gt;{{Harvnb|Ilachinski|2001|p=xxix|ref=ilachinski}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nils Aall Barricelli]] performed many of the earliest explorations of these models of artificial life.
[[File:John von Neumann ID badge.png|thumb|left|upright|[[John von Neumann]], [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] ID badge]]
Ulam and von Neumann created a method for calculating liquid motion in the late 1950s. The driving concept of the method was to consider a liquid as a group of discrete units and calculate the motion of each based on its neighbors' behaviors.&lt;ref name=bialynick-8&gt;{{Harvnb|Bialynicki-Birula, Bialynicka-Birula|2004|p=8|ref=bialynick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus was born the first system of cellular automata. Like Ulam's lattice network, [[Von Neumann cellular automata|von Neumann's cellular automata]] are two-dimensional, with his self-replicator implemented algorithmically. The result was a [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal copier and constructor]] working within a cellular automaton with a small neighborhood (only those cells that touch are neighbors; for von Neumann's cellular automata, only [[orthogonal]] cells), and with 29 states per cell.&lt;ref name=wolfram-876&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfram|2002|p=876|ref=wolfram}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann gave an existence proof that a particular pattern would make endless copies of itself within the given cellular universe by designing a 200,000 cell configuration that could do so.&lt;ref name=wolfram-876/&gt; This design is known as the [[tessellation]] model, and is called a [[von Neumann universal constructor]].&lt;ref name=TSRA&gt;{{cite book | author=von Neumann, John |author2=Burks, Arthur W. | title=Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata | year=1966 | publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1940s, [[Norbert Wiener]] and [[Arturo Rosenblueth]] developed a model of excitable media with some of the characteristics of a cellular automaton.&lt;ref name="Wiener-Rosenblueth"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiener | first1 = N. | last2 = Rosenblueth | first2 = A. | year = 1946 | title = The mathematical formulation of the problem of conduction of impulses in a network of connected excitable elements, specifically in cardiac muscle | url = | journal = Arch. Inst. Cardiol. México | volume = 16 | issue = | page = 205 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their specific motivation was the mathematical description of impulse conduction in cardiac systems. However their model is not a cellular automaton because the medium in which signals propagate is continuous, and wave fronts are curves.&lt;ref name="Wiener-Rosenblueth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reshodko"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Letichevskii|first1=A. A. |last2= Reshodko|first2=L. V.|title=N.

M. Greenberg and S. P. Hastings in 1978; see [[Greenberg-Hastings cellular automaton]]. The original work of Wiener and Rosenblueth contains many insights and continues to be cited in modern research publications on [[cardiac arrhythmia]] and excitable systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/355349a0 | last1 = Davidenko | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Pertsov | first2 = A.

By the end of the 1950s it had been noted that cellular automata could be viewed as [[parallel computer]]s, and particularly in the 1960s a sequence of increasingly detailed and technical theorems—often analogous to ones about Turing machines—were proved about their formal computational capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=877|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, cellular automata were studied as a particular type of [[dynamical system]] and the connection with the mathematical field of [[symbolic dynamics]] was established for the first time. In 1969, [[Gustav A. Hedlund]] compiled many results following this point of view&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01691062 | last1 = Hedlund | first1 = G. A. | authorlink = Gustav A. Hedlund | year = 1969 | title = Endomorphisms and automorphisms of the shift dynamical system | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/k62915l862l30377/ | journal = Math. Systems Theory | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 320–3751 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; in what is still considered as a seminal paper for the mathematical study of cellular automata. The most fundamental result is the characterization in the [[Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem]] of the set of global rules of cellular automata as the set of [[continuous function|continuous]] [[endomorphisms]] of [[shift space]]s.

In 1969, German computer pioneer [[Konrad Zuse]] published his book ''[[Calculating Space]]'', proposing that the physical laws of the universe are discrete by nature, and that the entire universe is the output of a deterministic computation on a single cellular automaton; "Zuse's Theory" became the foundation of the field of study called ''[[digital physics]]''.&lt;ref name=schiff-182&gt;{{Harvnb|Schiff|2011|p=182|ref=schiff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1969 computer scientist [[Alvy Ray Smith]] completed a Stanford PhD dissertation on Cellular Automata Theory, the first mathematical treatment of CA as a general class of computers. Many papers came from this dissertation: He showed the equivalence of neighborhoods of various shapes, how to reduce a Moore to a von Neumann neighborhood or how to reduce any neighborhood to a von Neumann neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Alvy Ray|title=Cellular Automata Complexity Trade-Offs|url=http://alvyray.com/Papers/CA/TradeOff.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proved that two-dimensional CA are computation universal, introduced 1-dimensional CA, and showed that they too are computation universal, even with simple neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Alvy Ray|title=Simple Computation-Universal Cellular Spaces|url=http://alvyray.com/Papers/CA/UniversalCA_1D.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed how to subsume the complex von Neumann proof of construction universality (and hence self-reproducing machines) into a consequence of computation universality in a 1-dimensional CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Alvy Ray|title=Simple Nontrivial Self-Reproducing Machines|url=http://alvyray.com/Papers/CA/alife2_optimized.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intended as the introduction to the German edition of von Neumann's book on CA, he wrote a survey of the field with dozens of references to papers, by many authors in many countries over a decade or so of work, often overlooked by modern CA researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Alvy Ray|title=Introduction to and Survey of Cellular Automata or Polyautomata Theory|url=http://alvyray.com/Papers/CA/PolyCA76.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s a two-state, two-dimensional cellular automaton named [[Game of Life]] became widely known, particularly among the early computing community. Invented by [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] and popularized by [[Martin Gardner]] in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gardner | first1 =Martin | year = 1970 | title = Mathematical Games: The fantastic combinations of John Conway's new solitaire game "life" | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/october1970.html | journal = Scientific American | issue = 223 | pages = 120–123 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; its rules are as follows:
# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
Despite its simplicity, the system achieves an impressive diversity of behavior, fluctuating between apparent [[randomness]] and order. One of the most apparent features of the Game of Life is the frequent occurrence of ''gliders'', arrangements of cells that essentially move themselves across the grid. It is possible to arrange the automaton so that the gliders interact to perform computations, and after much effort it has been shown that the Game of Life can emulate a universal [[Turing machine]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Chapman. Life universal computer. http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/ November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; It was viewed as a largely recreational topic, and little follow-up work was done outside of investigating the particularities of the Game of Life and a few related rules in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=Wainwright-16&gt;{{Harvnb|Wainwright|2010|p=16|ref= Adamatzky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Wolfram]] independently began working on cellular automata in mid 1981 after considering how complex patterns seemed formed in nature in violation of the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name=wolfram-880/&gt; His investigations were initially spurred by an interest in modelling systems such as [[neural network]]s.&lt;ref name=wolfram-880/&gt; He published his first paper in ''[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]'' investigating ''[[elementary cellular automaton|elementary cellular automata]]'' ([[Rule 30]] in particular) in June 1983.&lt;ref name=reviews/&gt;&lt;ref name=wolfram-880&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfram|2002|p=880|ref=wolfram}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected complexity of the behavior of these simple rules led Wolfram to suspect that complexity in nature may be due to similar mechanisms.&lt;ref name=wolfram-880/&gt; His investigations, however, led him to realize that cellular automata were poor at modelling neural networks.&lt;ref name=wolfram-880/&gt; Additionally, during this period Wolfram formulated the concepts of intrinsic [[randomness]] and [[computational irreducibility]],&lt;ref name=wolfram-881&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfram|2002|p=881|ref=wolfram}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that [[rule 110]] may be [[Turing-complete|universal]]—a fact proved later by Wolfram's research assistant [[Matthew Cook]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mitchell, Melanie | authorlink=Melanie Mitchell | title=Is the Universe a Universal Computer? | journal=[[Science (magazine)|Science]] | date=4 October 2002 | volume=298 | issue=5591 | pages=65–68 | doi=10.1126/science.1075073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Wolfram published a 1280-page text ''[[A New Kind of Science]]'', which extensively argues that the discoveries about cellular automata are not isolated facts but are robust and have significance for all disciplines of science.&lt;ref name=wolfram-1-7&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfram|2002|pp=1–7|ref=wolfram}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite confusion in the press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/09/books/review/09JOHNSOT.html | author=Johnson, George | title='A New Kind of Science': You Know That Space-Time Thing?

==Classification==
Wolfram, in ''A New Kind of Science'' and several papers dating from the mid-1980s, defined four classes into which cellular automata and several other simple computational models can be divided depending on their behavior. While earlier studies in cellular automata tended to try to identify type of patterns for specific rules, Wolfram's classification was the first attempt to classify the rules themselves. In order of complexity the classes are:
*Class 1: Nearly all initial patterns evolve quickly into a stable, homogeneous state. Any randomness in the initial pattern disappears.&lt;ref name=ilachinski-12&gt;{{Harvnb|Ilachinsky|2001|p=12|ref=ilachinski}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Class 2: Nearly all initial patterns evolve quickly into stable or oscillating structures. Some of the randomness in the initial pattern may filter out, but some remains. Local changes to the initial pattern tend to remain local.&lt;ref name=ilachinski-12/&gt;
*Class 3: Nearly all initial patterns evolve in a pseudo-random or chaotic manner. Any stable structures that appear are quickly destroyed by the surrounding noise. Local changes to the initial pattern tend to spread indefinitely.&lt;ref name=ilachinski-12/&gt;
*Class 4: Nearly all initial patterns evolve into structures that interact in complex and interesting ways, with the formation of local structures that are able to survive for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=ilachinski-13&gt;{{Harvnb|Ilachinsky|2001|p=13|ref=ilachinski}}&lt;/ref&gt; Class 2 type stable or oscillating structures may be the eventual outcome, but the number of steps required to reach this state may be very large, even when the initial pattern is relatively simple. Local changes to the initial pattern may spread indefinitely. Wolfram has conjectured that many, if not all class 4 cellular automata are capable of universal computation. This has been proven for Rule 110 and Conway's game of Life.

These definitions are qualitative in nature and there is some room for interpretation. According to Wolfram, "...with almost any general classification scheme there are inevitably cases which get assigned to one class by one definition and another class by another definition. And so it is with cellular automata: there are occasionally rules...that show some features of one class and some of another."&lt;ref name=wolfram-231&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfram|2002|p=231|ref=wolfram}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfram's classification has been empirically matched to a clustering of the compressed lengths of the outputs of cellular automata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zenil|first=Hector|title=Compression-based investigation of the dynamical properties of cellular automata and other systems|journal=Complex Systems|year=2010|volume=19|issue=1|url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/19-1-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several attempts to classify cellular automata in formally rigorous classes, inspired by the Wolfram's classification. For instance, Culik and Yu proposed three well-defined classes (and a fourth one for the automata not matching any of these), which are sometimes called Culik-Yu classes; membership in these proved [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]].&lt;ref name="DelormeMazoyer1998"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=M.

Wolfram's class 2 can be partitioned into two subgroups of stable (fixed-point) and oscillating (periodic) rules.&lt;ref name=li-packard&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/04-3-3.pdf | author1=Li, Wentian | authorlink1=Wentian Li | author2=Packard, Norman | title=The structure of the elementary cellular automata rule space | journal=Complex Systems | pages=281–297 | volume=4 | year=1990 | accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that there are 4 classes of dynamical system came originally from nobel-prize winning chemist [[Ilya Prigogine]] who identified these 4 classes of for thermodynamical systems - (1) systems in thermodynamic equilibrium, (2) spatially/temporally uniform systems, (3) chaotic systems, and (4) complex far-from-equilibrium systems with dissipative structures (see figure 1 in Nicolis' paper (Prigogine's student)).&lt;ref name=nicolis&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/04-3-3.pdf | author1=Nicolis | title=Dissipative Structures, Catastrophes, and Pattern Formation: A Bifurcation Analysis | journal=PNAS | pages=2748–2751 | volume=71 | number=7 | year=1974 | accessdate=25 March 2017 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.71.7.2748| pmid=16592170 | pmc=388547 | bibcode=1974PNAS...71.2748N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reversible===
{{main|Reversible cellular automaton}}
A cellular automaton is ''reversible'' if, for every current configuration of the cellular automaton, there is exactly one past configuration ([[preimage]]).&lt;ref name=kari-379&gt;{{Harvnb|Kari, Jarrko|1991|p=379|ref=gutowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one thinks of a cellular automaton as a function mapping configurations to configurations, reversibility implies that this function is [[bijective]].&lt;ref name=kari-379/&gt; If a cellular automaton is reversible, its time-reversed behavior can also be described as a cellular automaton; this fact is a consequence of the [[Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem]], a topological characterization of cellular automata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=D.|last=Richardson|title=Tessellations with local transformations|journal=J.

For one-dimensional cellular automata there are known algorithms for deciding whether a rule is reversible or irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amoroso | first1 = Serafino | last2 = Patt | first2 = Yale N. | year = 1972 | title = Decision Procedures for Surjectivity and Injectivity of Parallel Maps for Tessellation Structures | url = | journal = J.

The proof by [[Jarkko Kari]] is related to the tiling problem by [[Wang tile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Jarkko|last=Kari|authorlink=Jarkko Kari|title=Reversibility of 2D cellular automata is undecidable|journal=Physica D|volume=45|issue=1–3|year=1990|pages=379–385|doi=10.1016/0167-2789(90)90195-U|bibcode = 1990PhyD...45..379K|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reversible cellular automata are often used to simulate such physical phenomena as gas and fluid dynamics, since they obey the laws of [[thermodynamics]]. Such cellular automata have rules specially constructed to be reversible. Such systems have been studied by [[Tommaso Toffoli]], [[Norman Margolus]] and others. Several techniques can be used to explicitly construct reversible cellular automata with known inverses. Two common ones are the [[second order cellular automaton]] and the [[block cellular automaton]], both of which involve modifying the definition of a cellular automaton in some way. Although such automata do not strictly satisfy the definition given above, it can be shown that they can be emulated by conventional cellular automata with sufficiently large neighborhoods and numbers of states, and can therefore be considered a subset of conventional cellular automata. Conversely, it has been shown that every reversible cellular automaton can be emulated by a block cellular automaton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the circuit depth of structurally reversible cellular automata|first=Jarkko|last=Kari|authorlink=Jarkko Kari|journal=Fundamenta Informaticae|volume=38|year=1999|pages=93–107|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Representing reversible cellular automata with reversible block cellular automata|last=Durand-Lose|first=Jérôme|journal=Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science|volume=AA|year=2001|pages=145–154|url=http://www.dmtcs.org/dmtcs-ojs/index.php/proceedings/article/download/264/855|ref=harv|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515134011/http://www.dmtcs.org/dmtcs-ojs/index.php/proceedings/article/download/264/855|archivedate=15 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Totalistic===
A special class of cellular automata are ''totalistic'' cellular automata. The state of each cell in a totalistic cellular automaton is represented by a number (usually an integer value drawn from a finite set), and the value of a cell at time ''t'' depends only on the ''sum'' of the values of the cells in its neighborhood (possibly including the cell itself) at time&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=wolfram-60&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfram|2002|p=60|ref=wolfram}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cadu"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cellular automata: a discrete universe|first=Andrew|last=Ilachinski|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001|isbn=978-981-238-183-5|pages=44–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Hx2lx_pEF8C&amp;pg=PA4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the state of the cell at time ''t'' depends on both its own state and the total of its neighbors at time&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 then the cellular automaton is properly called ''outer totalistic''.&lt;ref name="cadu"/&gt; [[Conway's Game of Life]] is an example of an outer totalistic cellular automaton with cell values 0 and 1; outer totalistic cellular automata with the same [[Moore neighborhood]] structure as Life are sometimes called [[{{Not a typo|Life-like}} cellular automaton|{{Not a typo|life-like}} cellular automata]].&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "{{Not a typo|life-like}} cellular automaton" dates back at least to {{harvtxt|Barral|Chaté|Manneville|1992}}, who used it in a broader sense to refer to outer totalistic automata, not necessarily of two dimensions. The more specific meaning given here was used e.g. in several chapters of {{harvtxt|Adamatzky|2010}}. See: {{Cite journal|title=Collective behaviors in a family of high-dimensional cellular automata|first1=Bernard|last1=Barral|first2=Hugues|last2=Chaté|first3=Paul|last3=Manneville|journal=Physics Letters A|volume=163|issue=4|year=1992|pages=279–285|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(92)91013-H|ref=harv|bibcode = 1992PhLA..163..279B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eppstein-72-73&gt;{{Harvnb|Eppstein|2010|pp=72–73|ref=Adamatzky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related automata===
There are many possible generalizations of the cellular automaton concept.

[[File:Oscillator.gif|right|frame|A cellular automaton based on hexagonal cells instead of squares (rule 34/2)]]
One way is by using something other than a rectangular (cubic, ''etc.'') grid. For example, if a plane is [[hexagonal tiling|tiled with regular hexagons]], those hexagons could be used as cells. In many cases the resulting cellular automata are equivalent to those with rectangular grids with specially designed neighborhoods and rules. Another variation would be to make the grid itself irregular, such as with [[Penrose tiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22134-first-gliders-navigate-everchanging-penrose-universe.html|title=First gliders navigate ever-changing Penrose universe|author=Jacob Aron|work=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, rules can be probabilistic rather than deterministic. Such cellular automata are called [[probabilistic cellular automata]]. A probabilistic rule gives, for each pattern at time ''t'', the probabilities that the central cell will transition to each possible state at time ''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. Sometimes a simpler rule is used; for example: "The rule is the Game of Life, but on each time step there is a 0.001% probability that each cell will transition to the opposite color."

The neighborhood or rules could change over time or space. For example, initially the new state of a cell could be determined by the horizontally adjacent cells, but for the next generation the vertical cells would be used.

In cellular automata, the new state of a cell is not affected by the new state of other cells. This could be changed so that, for instance, a 2 by 2 block of cells can be determined by itself and the cells adjacent to itself.

There are ''[[continuous automaton|continuous automata]]''. These are like totalistic cellular automata, but instead of the rule and states being discrete (''e.g.'' a table, using states {0,1,2}), continuous functions are used, and the states become continuous (usually values in [[unit interval|[0,1]]]). The state of a location is a finite number of real numbers. Certain cellular automata can yield diffusion in liquid patterns in this way.

[[Continuous spatial automata]] have a continuum of locations. The state of a location is a finite number of real numbers. Time is also continuous, and the state evolves according to differential equations. One important example is [[reaction-diffusion]] textures, differential equations proposed by [[Alan Turing]] to explain how chemical reactions could create the stripes on [[zebra]]s and spots on leopards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Murray | first = J.|title = Mathematical Biology II |publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these are approximated by cellular automata, they often yield similar patterns. MacLennan [http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/contin-comp.html] considers continuous spatial automata as a model of computation.

There are known examples of continuous spatial automata, which exhibit propagating phenomena analogous to gliders in the Game of Life.&lt;ref&gt;Pivato, M: "RealLife: The continuum limit of Larger than Life cellular automata",  ''Theoretical Computer Science'', 372 (1), March 2007, pp. 46–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elementary cellular automata==
{{Main|Elementary cellular automaton}}
The simplest nontrivial cellular automaton would be one-dimensional, with two possible states per cell, and a cell's neighbors defined as the adjacent cells on either side of it. A cell and its two neighbors form a neighborhood of 3 cells, so there are 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8 possible patterns for a neighborhood. A rule consists of deciding, for each pattern, whether the cell will be a 1 or a 0 in the next generation. There are then 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;256 possible rules.&lt;ref name=bialynick-9/&gt; 

[[File:One-d-cellular-automate-rule-30.gif|thumb|An animation of the way the rules of a 1D cellular automaton determine the next generation.]]

These 256 cellular automata are generally referred to by their [[Wolfram code]], a standard naming convention invented by Wolfram that gives each rule a number from 0 to 255. A number of papers have analyzed and compared these 256 cellular automata. The [[rule 30]] and [[rule 110]] cellular automata are particularly interesting. The images below show the history of each when the starting configuration consists of a 1 (at the top of each image) surrounded by 0s. Each row of pixels represents a generation in the history of the automaton, with ''t''=0 being the top row. Each pixel is colored white for 0 and black for&amp;nbsp;1.

Rule 30 exhibits ''class 3'' behavior, meaning even simple input patterns such as that shown lead to chaotic, seemingly random histories.

Rule 110, like the Game of Life, exhibits what Wolfram calls ''class 4'' behavior, which is neither completely random nor completely repetitive. Localized structures appear and interact in various complicated-looking ways. In the course of the development of ''[[A New Kind of Science]]'', as a research assistant to Wolfram in 1994, [[Matthew Cook]] proved that some of these structures were rich enough to support [[Universal Turing Machine|universality]]. This result is interesting because rule 110 is an extremely simple one-dimensional system, and difficult to engineer to perform specific behavior. This result therefore provides significant support for Wolfram's view that class 4 systems are inherently likely to be universal. Cook presented his proof at a [[Santa Fe Institute]] conference on Cellular Automata in 1998, but Wolfram blocked the proof from being included in the conference proceedings, as Wolfram did not want the proof announced before the publication of ''A New Kind of Science''.&lt;ref name=giles&gt;{{cite journal | author=Giles, Jim | title=What Kind of Science is This? | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=417 | issue=6886 | pages=216–218 | year=2002|doi=10.1038/417216a | pmid=12015565 | bibcode=2002Natur.417..216G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Cook's proof was finally published in Wolfram's journal ''[[Complex Systems (journal)|Complex Systems]]'' (Vol. 15, No. 1), over ten years after Cook came up with it. Rule 110 has been the basis for some of the smallest universal Turing machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2002/oct/24/is-the-universe-a-computer/?pagination=false | author=Weinberg, Steven | title=Is the Universe a Computer? | journal=[[The New York Review of Books]] | date=24 October 2002 | accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rule space==
An elementary cellular automaton rule is specified by 8 bits, and all elementary cellular automaton rules can be considered to sit on the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the 8-dimensional unit [[hypercube]]. This unit hypercube is the cellular automaton rule space. For next-nearest-neighbor cellular automata, a rule is specified by 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;32 bits, and the cellular automaton rule space is a 32-dimensional unit hypercube. A distance between two rules can be defined by the number of steps required to move from one vertex, which represents the first rule, and another vertex, representing another rule, along the [[edge (geometry)|edge]] of the hypercube. This rule-to-rule distance is also called the [[Hamming distance]].

Cellular automaton rule space allows us to ask the question concerning whether rules with similar dynamical behavior are "close" to each other. Graphically drawing a high dimensional hypercube on the 2-dimensional plane remains a difficult task, and one crude locator of a rule in the hypercube is the number of bit-1 in the 8-bit string for elementary rules (or 32-bit string for the next-nearest-neighbor rules). Drawing the rules in different Wolfram classes in these slices of the rule space show that class 1 rules tend to have lower number of bit-1's, thus located in one region of the space, whereas class 3 rules tend to have higher proportion (50%) of bit-1's.&lt;ref name=li-packard /&gt;

For larger cellular automaton rule space, it is shown that class 4 rules are located between the class 1 and class 3 rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Physica D|volume=45|issue=1–3|year=1990|pages=77–94|title= Transition phenomena in cellular automata rule space |author1=Wentian Li |author2=Norman Packard |author3=Chris G Langton |doi=10.1016/0167-2789(90)90175-O|url= |bibcode = 1990PhyD...45...77L |citeseerx=10.1.1.15.2786}}&lt;/ref&gt; This observation is the foundation for the phrase [[edge of chaos]], and is reminiscent of the [[phase transition]] in [[thermodynamics]].

==Biology==
[[File:Textile cone.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Conus textile]]'' exhibits a cellular automaton pattern on its shell.&lt;ref name=coombs/&gt;]]
{{further|Patterns in nature}}

Some biological processes occur—or can be simulated—by cellular automata.

Patterns of some [[seashell]]s, like the ones in the genera ''[[Cone snail|Conus]]'' and ''[[Cymbiola]]'', are generated by natural cellular automata. The [[pigment]] cells reside in a narrow band along the shell's lip. Each cell [[secretion|secretes]] pigments according to the activating and inhibiting activity of its neighbor pigment cells, obeying a natural version of a mathematical rule.&lt;ref name=coombs&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.maths.nott.ac.uk/personal/sc/pdfs/Seashells09.pdf | last=Coombs |first=Stephen |title=The Geometry and Pigmentation of Seashells | pages=3–4 | date=15 February 2009 | accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cell band leaves the colored pattern on the shell as it grows slowly. For example, the widespread species ''[[Conus textile]]'' bears a pattern resembling Wolfram's [[rule 30]] cellular automaton.&lt;ref name=coombs/&gt;

Plants regulate their intake and loss of gases via a cellular automaton mechanism. Each [[Stomata|stoma]] on the leaf acts as a cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0307811100 | last1 = Peak | first1 = West | last2 = Messinger | first2 = Mott | year = 2004 | title = Evidence for complex, collective dynamics and emergent, distributed computation in plants | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/101/4/918 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 101 | issue = 4| pages = 918–922 |bibcode = 2004PNAS..101..918P | ref = harv | pmid=14732685 | pmc=327117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving wave patterns on the skin of [[cephalopod]]s can be simulated with a two-state, two-dimensional cellular automata, each state corresponding to either an expanded or retracted [[chromatophore]].&lt;ref&gt;http://gilly.stanford.edu/past_research_files/APackardneuralnet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fibroblast]]s bear similarities to cellular automata, as each fibroblast only interacts with its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Disordered Systems and Biological Organization|year=1986|pages=374–375|author=Yves Bouligand|authorlink=Fibroblasts, Morphogenesis and Cellular Automata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical types==
The [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]] is a spatio-temporal chemical oscillator that can be simulated by means of a cellular automaton. In the 1950s [[Anatol Zhabotinsky|A. M. Zhabotinsky]] (extending the work of [[B. P. Belousov]]) discovered that when a thin, homogenous layer of a mixture of [[malonic acid]], acidified bromate, and a ceric salt were mixed together and left undisturbed, fascinating geometric patterns such as concentric circles and spirals propagate across the medium. In the "Computer Recreations" section of the August 1988 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'',&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Dewdney, The hodgepodge machine makes waves, Scientific American, p. 104, August 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. K. Dewdney]] discussed a cellular automaton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerhardt | first1 = M. | last2 = Schuster | first2 = H. | year = 1989 | title = A cellular automaton describing the formation of spatially ordered structures in chemical systems | url = | journal = Physica D | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 209–221 | doi=10.1016/0167-2789(89)90081-x| bibcode = 1989PhyD...36..209G }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by Martin Gerhardt and Heike Schuster of the University of Bielefeld (Germany). This automaton produces wave patterns that resemble those in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.

==Applications==

===Computer processors===
Cellular automaton processors are physical implementations of CA concepts, which can process information computationally. Processing elements are arranged in a regular grid of identical cells. The grid is usually a square tiling, or [[tessellation]], of two or three dimensions; other tilings are possible, but not yet used. Cell states are determined only by interactions with adjacent neighbor cells. No means exists to communicate directly with cells farther away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Muhtaroglu, Ali | title=Cellular Automaton Processor Based Systems for Genetic Sequence Comparison/Database Searching | chapter=4.1 Cellular Automaton Processor (CAP) | pages=62–74 | publisher=Cornell University |date=August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such cellular automaton processor array configuration is the [[systolic array]]. Cell interaction can be via electric charge, magnetism, vibration ([[phonons]] at quantum scales), or any other physically useful means. This can be done in several ways so no wires are needed between any elements. This is very unlike processors used in most computers today, [[Von Neumann architecture|von Neumann designs]], which are divided into sections with elements that can communicate with distant elements over wires.

===Cryptography===
[[Rule 30]] was originally suggested as a possible [[block cipher]] for use in [[cryptography]]. Two dimensional cellular automata can be used for constructing a [[pseudorandom number generator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=M. | last1=Tomassini | first2=M. | last2=Sipper | first3=M. | last3=Perrenoud | title=On the generation of high-quality random numbers by two-dimensional cellular automata | journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers | volume=49 | issue=10 | pages=1146–1151 | year=2000 | doi=10.1109/12.888056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellular automata have been proposed for [[public key cryptography]]. The [[one-way function]] is the evolution of a finite CA whose inverse is believed to be hard to find. Given the rule, anyone can easily calculate future states, but it appears to be very difficult to calculate previous states. &lt;!-- However, the designer of the rule can create it in such a way as to easily invert it.  Therefore, it is apparently a [[trapdoor function]], and can be used as a public-key cryptosystem.  The security of such systems is not currently known. --&gt;

===Error correction coding===
CA have been applied to design [[ECC memory|error correction codes]] in a paper by D. Roy Chowdhury, S. Basu, I. Sen Gupta, and P. Pal Chaudhuri. The paper defines a new scheme of building single bit error correction and double bit error detection (SEC-DED) codes using CA, and also reports a fast hardware decoder for the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Design of CAECC - cellular automata based error correcting code | first1=D. Roy | last1=Chowdhury | first2=S. | last2=Basu | first3=I. Sen | last3=Gupta | first4=P. Pal | last4=Chaudhuri | journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Computers]] | volume=43 | issue=6 | date=June 1994 | doi=10.1109/12.286310 | pages=759–764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modeling physical reality==
{{main|Digital physics|digital philosophy}}
As Andrew Ilachinski points out in his ''Cellular Automata'', many scholars have raised the question of whether the universe is a cellular automaton.&lt;ref name=ilachinski-660&gt;{{Harvnb|Ilachinsky|2001|p=660|ref=ilachinski}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilachinski argues that the importance of this question may be better appreciated with a simple observation, which can be stated as follows. Consider the evolution of [[rule 110]]: if it were some kind of "alien physics", what would be a reasonable description of the observed patterns?&lt;ref name=ilachinski-661-662&gt;{{Harvnb|Ilachinsky|2001|pp=661–662|ref=ilachinski}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an observer did not know how the images were generated, that observer might end up conjecturing about the movement of some particle-like objects. Indeed, physicist [[James P. Crutchfield|James Crutchfield]] has constructed a rigorous mathematical theory out of this idea, proving the statistical emergence of "particles" from cellular automata.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Crutchfield, [http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/papers/CalcEmerg.pdf &lt;nowiki&gt;"The Calculi of Emergence: Computation, Dynamics, and Induction"&lt;/nowiki&gt;], [[Physica (journal)#Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena|Physica D]] 75, 11–54, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, as the argument goes, one might wonder if ''our'' world, which is currently well described, at our current level of understanding, by [[particle physics|physics with particle-like objects]], could be a CA at its most fundamental level with the gaps in information or incomplete understanding of fundamental data appearing as an arbitrary random order that would seem contrary to CA.

While a complete theory along this line has not been developed, entertaining and developing this hypothesis led scholars to interesting speculation and fruitful intuitions on how we can make sense of our world within a discrete framework. [[Marvin Minsky]], the AI pioneer, investigated how to understand particle interaction with a four-dimensional CA lattice;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Minsky | first1 = M. | year = 1982| title = Cellular Vacuum | url = | journal = International Journal of Theoretical Physics | volume = 21 | issue = 537–551| page = 1982 | doi=10.1007/bf02650183| bibcode = 1982IJTP...21..537M}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Konrad Zuse]]—the inventor of the first working computer, the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]]—developed an irregularly organized lattice to address the question of the information content of particles.&lt;ref&gt;K. Zuse, "The Computing Universe", Int. Jour. of Theo. Phy. 21, 589–600, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Edward Fredkin]] exposed what he terms the "finite nature hypothesis", i.e., the idea that "ultimately every quantity of physics, including space and time, will turn out to be discrete and finite."&lt;ref&gt;E. Fredkin, "Digital mechanics: an informational process based on reversible universal cellular automata", Physica D 45, 254–270, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Fredkin and Wolfram are strong proponents of a CA-based physics. In 2016 [[Gerard 't Hooft]] published a book-length development of the idea to rebuild [[quantum mechanics]] using cellular automata.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard 't Hooft, 2016, ''The Cellular Automaton Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics'', Springer International Publishing, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-41285-6, [[Open access]]-[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-41285-6]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, other suggestions along these lines have emerged from literature in non-standard computation. Wolfram's ''[[A New Kind of Science]]'' considers CA the key to understanding a variety of subjects, physics included. The ''Mathematics of the Models of Reference''—created by [[iLabs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilabs.it/|title=Ilabs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; founder Gabriele Rossi and developed with Francesco Berto and Jacopo Tagliabue—features an original 2D/3D universe based on a new "rhombic dodecahedron-based" lattice and a unique rule. This model satisfies universality (it is equivalent to a Turing Machine) and perfect reversibility (a ''desideratum'' if one wants to conserve various quantities easily and never lose information), and it comes embedded in a first-order theory, allowing computable, qualitative statements on the universe evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmdr.it/defaultEN.asp F. Berto, G. Rossi, J. Tagliabue, The Mathematics of the Models of Reference], [[College Publications]], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Each selected faculty member identifies 2-5 of her/his students for participation based on demographic guidelines established by CURM.&lt;ref name=FullDescription/&gt; Special emphasis is given to females, minorities, 1st generation college students, and disabled students. The number of participating faculty and students depends on funding.

==The Program==

Faculty members whose applications are accepted by CURM are awarded grants of $15,000-$25,000.&lt;ref name=FullDescription/&gt; These consist of a $3,000 stipend for each participating student, a $6,000 stipend for each professor/mentor, $250 in supply funds, and up to $650 per participant for travel.&lt;ref&gt;Kwembe, T., Leonard, K., Pineda, A. "Academic Year Undergraduate Research: The CURM Model," ''Involve'', 2013, pp. 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Student participants give a presentation at the spring Student Research Conference usually held at [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneseo.edu/math/rault-CURM|title=Undergraduate Research 2014-15 working group|website=Geneseo University|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty members also come to BYU for a 3-day workshop on mentoring skills.&lt;ref name=FullDescription/&gt;

'''Common knowledge''' is a special kind of [[knowledge]] for a group of [[wiktionary:agent|agent]]s. There is ''common knowledge'' of ''p'' in a group of agents ''G'' when all the agents in ''G'' know ''p'', they all know that they know ''p'', they all know that they all know that they know ''p'', and so on ''ad infinitum''.&lt;ref name=Osborne&gt;Osborne, Martin J., and [[Ariel Rubinstein]]. ''A Course in Game Theory''. Cambridge, MA: MIT, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was first introduced in the philosophical literature by [[David Kellogg Lewis]] in his study ''Convention'' (1969).  The sociologist Morris Friedell defined common knowledge in a 1969 paper.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedell, "On the Structure of Shared Awareness," Behavioral Science 14 (1969): 28–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first given a mathematical formulation in a [[set theory|set-theoretical]] framework by [[Robert Aumann]] (1976). [[computer science|Computer scientists]] grew an interest in the subject of [[epistemic logic]] in general&amp;nbsp;– and of common knowledge in particular&amp;nbsp;– starting in the 1980s.{{ref|CSTexts}}  There are numerous [[Logic puzzle|puzzles]] based upon the concept which have been extensively investigated by mathematicians such as [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Math Hysteria| author=Ian Stewart |year=2004 |publisher=OUP |chapter=I Know That You Know That... |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Stephen Schiffer]], in his book ''Meaning'', independently developed a notion he called "mutual knowledge" which functions quite similarly to Lewis's "common knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Schiffer, ''Meaning'', 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, 1988.  The first edition was published by OUP in 1972.  For a discussion of both Lewis's and Schiffer's notions, see Russell Dale, ''[http://www.russelldale.com/dissertation/1996.RussellDale.TheTheoryOfMeaning.pdf The Theory of Meaning]'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

=== Puzzle ===

The idea of common knowledge is often introduced by some variant of the following puzzle:{{ref|Sevitan}}

On an island, there are ''k'' people who have blue eyes, and the rest of the people have green eyes. At the start of the puzzle, no one on the island ever knows their own eye color. By rule, if a person on the island ever discovers they have blue eyes, that person must leave the island at dawn; anyone not making such a discovery always sleeps until after dawn. On the island, each person knows every other person's eye color, there are no reflective surfaces, and there is no communication of eye color.

At some point, an outsider comes to the island, calls together all the people on the island, and makes the following public announcement: "At least one of you has blue eyes". The outsider, furthermore, is known by all to be truthful, and all know that all know this, and so on: it is common knowledge that he is truthful, and thus it becomes common knowledge that there is at least one islander who has blue eyes. The problem: assuming all persons on the island are completely logical and that this too is common knowledge, what is the eventual outcome?

=== Solution ===

The answer is that, on the ''k''th dawn after the announcement, all the blue-eyed people will leave the island.

==== Proof ====
The solution can be seen with an inductive argument. If ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (that is, there is exactly one blue-eyed person), the person will recognize that they alone have blue eyes (by seeing only green eyes in the others) and leave at the first dawn. If ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, no one will leave at the first dawn. The two blue-eyed people, seeing only one person with blue eyes, ''and'' that no one left on the 1st dawn (and thus that ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1), will leave on the second dawn. Inductively, it can be reasoned that no one will leave at the first ''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 dawns if and only if there are at least ''k'' blue-eyed people. Those with blue eyes, seeing ''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 blue-eyed people among the others and knowing there must be at least ''k'', will reason that they must have blue eyes and leave.

What's most interesting about this scenario is that, for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, the outsider is only telling the island citizens what they already know: that there are blue-eyed people among them. However, before this fact is announced, the fact is not ''common knowledge''.

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, it is merely "first-order" knowledge. Each blue-eyed person knows that there is someone with blue eyes, but each blue eyed person does ''not'' know that the other blue-eyed person has this same knowledge.

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, it is "second order" knowledge. Each blue-eyed person knows that a second blue-eyed person knows that a third person has blue eyes, but no one knows that there is a ''third'' blue-eyed person with that knowledge, until the outsider makes his statement.

In general: For ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, it is "(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)th order" knowledge. Each blue-eyed person knows that a second blue-eyed person knows that a third blue-eyed person knows that.... (repeat for a total of ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 levels) a ''k''th person has blue eyes, but no one knows that there is a "''k''th" blue-eyed person with that knowledge, until the outsider makes his statement. The notion of ''common knowledge'' therefore has a palpable effect. Knowing that everyone knows does make a difference. When the outsider's public announcement (a fact already known to all) becomes common knowledge, the blue-eyed people on this island eventually deduce their status, and leave.

== Formalization ==

=== Modal logic (syntactic characterization) ===

Common knowledge can be given a logical definition in [[Modal logic|multi-modal logic]] systems in which the modal operators are interpreted [[epistemic logic|epistemically]]. At the propositional level, such systems are extensions of [[propositional logic]]. The extension consists of the introduction of a group ''G'' of ''agents'', and of ''n'' modal operators ''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (with ''i'' = 1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'') with the intended meaning that "agent ''i'' knows." Thus ''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'' (where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula of the calculus) is read "agent ''i'' knows &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;." We can define an operator ''E&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the intended meaning of "everyone in group ''G'' knows" by defining it with the axiom

: &lt;math&gt;E_G \varphi \Leftrightarrow \bigwedge_{i \in G} K_i \varphi,&lt;/math&gt;

By abbreviating the expression &lt;math&gt;E_GE_G^{n-1} \varphi&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;E_G^n \varphi&lt;/math&gt;  and defining &lt;math&gt;E_G^0 \varphi = \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, we could then define common knowledge with the axiom

: &lt;math&gt;C \varphi \Leftrightarrow \bigwedge_{i = 0}^\infty E^i \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

There is however a complication. The languages of epistemic logic are usually ''finitary'', whereas the [[axiom]] above defines common knowledge as an infinite conjunction of formulas, hence not a [[well-formed formula]] of the language. To overcome this difficulty, a ''fixed-point'' definition of common knowledge can be given. Intuitively, common knowledge is thought of as the fixed point of the "equation" &lt;math&gt;C_G \varphi=\varphi\wedge E_G (C_G \varphi)&lt;/math&gt;. In this way, it is possible to find a formula &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; implying &lt;math&gt;E_G (\varphi \wedge C_G \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; from which, in the limit, we can infer common knowledge of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

This ''syntactic'' characterization is given semantic content through so-called ''Kripke structures''. A Kripke structure is given by (i) a set of states (or possible worlds) ''S'', (ii) ''n'' ''accessibility relations'' &lt;math&gt;R_1,\dots,R_n&lt;/math&gt;, defined on &lt;math&gt;S \times S&lt;/math&gt;, intuitively representing what states agent ''i'' considers possible from any given state, and (iii) a valuation function &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; assigning a [[truth value]], in each state, to each primitive proposition in the language. The semantics for the knowledge operator is given by stipulating that &lt;math&gt;K_i \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at state ''s'' iff &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at ''all'' states ''t'' such that &lt;math&gt;(s,t) \in R_i&lt;/math&gt;. The semantics for the common knowledge operator, then, is given by taking, for each group of agents ''G'', the reflexive and transitive closure of the &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, for all agents ''i'' in ''G'', call such a relation &lt;math&gt;R_G&lt;/math&gt;, and stipulating that &lt;math&gt;C_G \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at state ''s'' iff &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at ''all'' states ''t'' such that &lt;math&gt;(s,t) \in R_G&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Set theoretic (semantic characterization) ===

Alternatively (yet equivalently) common knowledge can be formalized using [[set theory]] (this was the path taken by the Nobel laureate  [[Robert Aumann]] in his seminal 1976 paper).  We will start with a set of states ''S''.  We can then define an event ''E'' as a subset of the set of states ''S''.  For each agent ''i'', define a [[Partition of a set|partition]] on ''S'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.  This partition represents the state of knowledge of an agent in a state.  In state ''s'', agent ''i'' knows that one of the states in ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') obtains, but not which one. (Here ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') denotes the unique element of ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' containing ''s''. Note that this model excludes cases in which agents know things that are not true.)

We can now define a knowledge function ''K'' in the following way:

: &lt;math&gt;K_i(e) = \{ s \in S \mid P_i(s) \subset e\}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''e'') is the set of states where the agent will know that event ''e'' obtains. It is a subset of ''e''.

Similar to the modal logic formulation above, we can define an operator for the idea that "everyone knows ''e''".

: &lt;math&gt;E(e) = \bigcap_i K_i(e)&lt;/math&gt;

As with the modal operator, we will iterate the ''E'' function, &lt;math&gt;E^1(e) = E(e)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^{n+1}(e) = E(E^{n}(e))&lt;/math&gt;.  Using this we can then define a common knowledge function,

: &lt;math&gt;C(e) = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} E^n(e).&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalence with the syntactic approach sketched above can easily be seen: consider an Aumann structure as the one just defined. We can define a correspondent Kripke structure by taking (i) the same space ''S'', (ii) accessibility relations &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; that define the equivalence classes corresponding to the partitions &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;, and (iii) a valuation function such that it yields value ''true'' to the primitive proposition ''p'' in all and only the states ''s'' such that &lt;math&gt;s \in E^p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E^p&lt;/math&gt; is the event of the Aumann structure corresponding to the primitive proposition ''p''. It is not difficult to see that the common knowledge accessibility function &lt;math&gt;R_G&lt;/math&gt; defined in the previous section corresponds to the finest common coarsening of the partitions &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i \in G&lt;/math&gt;, which is the finitary characterization of common knowledge also given by Aumann in the 1976 article.

== Applications ==

Common knowledge was used by David Lewis in his pioneering game-theoretical account of convention. In this sense, common knowledge is a concept still central for linguists and philosophers of language (see Clark 1996) maintaining a Lewisian, conventionalist account of language.

[[Robert Aumann]] introduced a set theoretical formulation of common knowledge (theoretically equivalent to the one given above) and proved the so-called [[Aumann's agreement theorem|agreement theorem]] through which: if two agents have common [[prior probability]] over a certain event, and the [[posterior probabilities]] are common knowledge, then such posterior probabilities are equal. A result based on the agreement theorem and proven by Milgrom shows that, given certain conditions on market efficiency and information, speculative trade is impossible.

The concept of common knowledge is central in [[game theory]]. For several years it has been thought that the assumption of common knowledge of rationality for the players in the game was fundamental. It turns out (Aumann and Brandenburger 1995) that, in 2-player games, common knowledge of rationality is not needed as an epistemic condition for [[Nash equilibrium]] [[strategy (game theory)|strategies]].

Computer scientists use languages incorporating epistemic logics (and common knowledge) to reason about distributed systems. Such systems can be based on logics more complicated than simple propositional epistemic logic, see Wooldridge ''Reasoning about Artificial Agents'', 2000 (in which he uses a first-order logic incorporating epistemic and temporal operators) or van der Hoek et al. "Alternating Time Epistemic Logic".

In his 2007 book,  ''[[The Stuff of Thought|The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature]],'' [[Steven Pinker]] uses the notion of common knowledge to analyze the kind of indirect speech involved in innuendoes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5418">A '''deliberatorium''' or '''collaboratorium''' is a form of online collaborative [[argument mapping]]. It was first deployed as the [[MIT]] Collaboratorium, and directed at the question of [[climate change]]. 

==History==

In December 2008,  Center for Collective Intelligence at the [[MIT]] Mark Klein tested a prototype of the collaboratorium at the [[University of Naples]] featuring a 200 student debate on biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bringing order to online discussions about climate change |url=http://blogs.nature.com/boston/2008/04/10/bringing-order-to-online-discussions-about-climate-change |website=Nature.com |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Features==

Deleiberatoriums work by deploying a website which allows the public to post the latest scientific results about climate change. Once done, people can debate how to get rid of carbon emissions which is how politicians get feedback on public opinion.  

The site operates similar to [[Wikipedia]] for authoritative reports but with a more structured, organized debate featuring an argument tree. These reports for the site come from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

'''Derek John de Solla Price''' (22 January 1922&amp;nbsp;– 3 September 1983) was a [[physics|physicist]], [[history of science|historian of science]], and [[information science|information scientist]],
credited as the father of [[scientometrics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Crawford | first1=S. | year=1984 | title=Derek John De Solla Price (1922-1983): The man and the contribution | journal=Bulletin of the Medical Library Association | volume=72 | issue=2 | pages=238–239 | pmid=6375781 | pmc=227421}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mackay | first1=Alan | last2= | first2= | year=1984 | title=Derek John de Solla Price: An Appreciation | journal=Social Studies of Science | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=315–320 | publisher= | jstor=284662 | doi=10.1177/030631284014002013 | url= | format= | access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Price was born in [[Leyton]], [[England]], to Philip Price, a [[tailor]], and Fanny de Solla, a singer. He began work in 1938 as an assistant in a physics laboratory at the [[Waltham Forest College|South West Essex Technical College]], before studying [[Physics]] and [[Mathematics]] at the [[University of London]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1942. He obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in [[experimental physics]] from the [[University of London]] in 1946.

In 1948 Price worked as a teacher of applied mathematics at Raffles College, which was to become part of the [[National University of Singapore]]. It was there that he formulated his theory on the exponential growth of science, an idea that occurred to him when he noticed the characteristic logarithmic curve of the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' between 1665 and 1850, which he had stacked against his wall at home while Raffles College had its library built.

After three years, Price returned to England to work on a second Ph.D., in the [[history of science]], this time at the [[University of Cambridge]]. During his Ph.D. studies, he accidentally discovered ''Equatorie of the Planetis'', a [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]] manuscript in [[Cambridge University Library]], written in [[Middle English]], which he attributed to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. It is now attributed to a [[St Albans]] monk called John Westwyk.

Around 1950, Price adopted his mother's [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] name, "de Solla", as a middle name. He was a "British [[Atheism|Atheist]]&amp;nbsp;... from a rather well-known Sephardic Jewish family", and although his [[Denmark|Danish]] wife, Ellen, had been christened as a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], he did not, according to their son [[Mark de Solla Price|Mark]], regard their marriage as "mixed", because they were both atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.markandvinny.com/Mark_de_Solla_Price_UU_Sermon_Gay_Pride_2007.pdf | title=Mark de Solla Price UU Sermon Gay Pride 2007 | last=Price | first=Mark de Solla | date=2007-06-17 | access-date=2008-08-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining his second doctorate, Price moved to the [[United States]], where he served as a consultant to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and as a fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. His next post was at [[Yale University]], where he worked until his death, serving as the Avalon Professor of the History of Science, and as chair of a new department that encompassed the histories of science, technology, and medicine.

In 1984, Price received, posthumously, the [[Association for Information Science and Technology|ASIS Research Award]] for outstanding contributions in the field of information science.

==Scientific contributions==
Price's major scientific contributions include:
* '''Price's square root law''' or '''Price's law''' pertains to the relationship between the literature on a subject and the number of authors in the subject area, stating that half of the publications come from the square root of all contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222619181_Price%27s_square_root_law_Empirical_validity_and_relation_to_Lotka%27s_law| author=Travis Nicholls, Paul| title= Price's square root law: Empirical validity and relation to Lotka's law. |publisher=ResearchGate |doi= 10.1016/0306-4573(88)90049-0 |date=December 1988 |access-date= September 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if 100 papers are written by 25 authors, five authors will have contributed 50 papers. Price's law is related to [[Lotka's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allison |first1=Paul D. |last2=Price |first2=Derek de Solla |last3=Griffith |first3=Belver C. |last4=Moravcsik |first4=Michael J. |last5=Stewart |first5=John A. |title=Lotka's Law: A Problem in Its Interpretation and Application |journal=Social Studies of Science |date=1976 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=269–276 |jstor=284934}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Studies of the exponential growth of science and the half-life of scientific literature;
* Quantitative studies of the network of citations between scientific papers (Price 1965), including the discovery that both the in- and out-degrees of a citation network have power-law distributions, making this the first published example of a [[scale-free network]];
* '''[[Price's model]]''', a mathematical theory of the growth of citation networks, based on what would now be called a [[preferential attachment]] process (Price 1976);&lt;ref&gt;The technical elements of Price's treatment relied heavily upon previous work by [[Herbert A. Simon]], but Price was the first to apply the idea to the growth of a network.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An analysis of the [[Antikythera mechanism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink=Derek J. de Solla Price | first=D.J. de Solla | last=Price | date=November 1974 | title=Gears from the Greeks.

'''Diaspora studies''' is an academic field established in the late 20th century to study dispersed [[ethnicity|ethnic]] populations, which are often termed [[diaspora peoples]]. The usage of the term [[diaspora]] carries the [[connotation]] of forced resettlement, due to expulsion, coercion, slavery, [[racism]], or war, especially [[nationalism|nationalist]] conflicts. 

==Academic institutes==
* The International Institute for Diasporic and Transcultural Studies (IIDTS) — a transnational institute incorporating [[Jean Moulin University]] ([[Lyon]]s, France), the [[University of Cyprus]], [[Sun Yat-sen University]] ([[Guangzhou]], China) and [[Liverpool Hope University]] (UK) — is a dedicated research network operating in a transdisciplinary logic and focused on cultural representation (and auto-representation) of diasporic communities throughout the world. The institute sponsors the trilingual publication ''Transtext(e)s-Transcultures: A Journal of Global Cultural Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transtexts.net ''Transtext(e)s-Transcultures website]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Nehru University's School of International Studies, [http://Jawaharlal%20Nehru%20University,%20New%20Delhi www.jnu.ac.in] has a strong research programme, DIMP (Diaspora and International Programme) and its faculty run a network [http://ODI www.odi.in] (Organisation for Diaspora Initiatives), an international network of higher academic researchers focused on studying Diaspora from International Perspective and examining diaspora as a resource in international relations. ODI publishes a research journal [http://Diaspora%20Studies www.tandfonline/rdst] with Routledge, London.

'''Erotic target location error''' ('''ETLE''') is having a sexual preference or strong sexual interest in features that are somewhere other than on one's sexual partners.&lt;ref name = Lawrence2009&gt;{{Cite journal

When one's sexual arousal is based on imagining oneself in another physical form (such as an animal, an infant, or an amputee) the erotic target is said to be one's self, or erotic target identity inversion.&lt;ref name = Blanchard&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Freund K

The terms "erotic target location error" and "erotic target identity inversion" were first used in 1993 by [[sexologist]] [[Ray Blanchard]].&lt;ref name =Blanchard/&gt;

== Types ==
The best known examples of erotic target identity inversions are biological males who experience sexual arousal in response to imagining themselves as women (called [[autogynephilia]]), but at least one case of anatomic [[autoandrophilia]] has also been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

| doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9446-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Beauty Myth]]'' (1990) by [[Naomi Wolf]], Wolf writes, "Women tell me they're jealous of the men who get so much pleasure from the female body; that they imagine being inside the male body that is inside their own so that they can vicariously experience desire."&lt;ref name="Wolf1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naomi Wolf|title=The Beauty Myth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0naAAAAMAAJ|year=1990|pages=127–|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|isbn=978-0-7011-3431-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas [[gynephilia]] refers to the sexual preference for women, autogynephilia refers to a male's sexual interest in being a woman.  Autogynephilia can be associated with [[gender dysphoria]] and [[gender identity disorder]], discontent with one's biological sex and the desire to undergo [[sex reassignment surgery|surgery for sex reassignment]] and permanently take on a role and life of the other sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Several other sexual interests also exist in ETLE forms:

{{anchor|Autozoophilia}}

== Sexuality in subcultures ==
There are many subcultures of people who are interested in transforming themselves to various degrees and interacting in their new role or identity.  Such interactions can include sexual interactions with other members of the community.  There is debate in these communities regarding whether their desire to transform is based on their sexual interests in the new form or based on [[autozoophilia|feeling like they are part animal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Winterman | first = D | title = What are the furries? | publisher = [[BBC News]] | accessdate = 2012-08-07 | date = 2009-11-13 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8355287.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In a letter to the editor of ''[[The Journal of Sex Research]],'' San Francisco-based physician and activist [[Charles Allen Moser]] criticized Lawrence' endorsement of the concept of ETLEs.&lt;ref name = MoserResponse&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that "there is nothing wrong with creating or expanding a classification system of sexual interests" but believed that Lawrence "pathologizes nonstandard sexual expression" and that "ETLEs are a [[slippery slope]]," whereas Moser's view is that all sexual phenomena should be removed from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)]].  Lawrence responded that "Moser's critiques of the paraphilias rely on fallacious reasoning" and that "most of his other criticism...results from his having ignored or misinterpreted my statements, either inadvertently or for rhetorical purposes." She indicated that "Moser correctly observed that such an unwarranted generalization would lead to ludicrous conclusions; but these would be wholly attributable to Moser's ludicrous misinterpretation of what I actually wrote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lawrence | first1 = A.

The '''history of Asian art''' or '''Eastern art''', includes a vast range of influences from various cultures and religions. Developments in Asian art historically parallel those in [[Western art]], in general a few centuries earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''The Meeting of Eastern and Western Art'', Revised and Expanded edition (Hardcover) by [[Michael Sullivan (art historian)|Michael Sullivan]],&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese art]], [[Indian art]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EED91E3CF933A25754C0A962958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2] NY Times, Holland Cotter, accessed online October 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korean art]], [[Japanese art]],&lt;ref&gt;Japonisme: The Japanese Influence on Western Art Since 1858 (Paperback)

==Buddhist art==

'''Buddhist art''' originated in the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the centuries following the life of the historical [[Gautama Buddha]] in the 6th to 5th century BCE, before evolving through its contact with other cultures and its diffusion through the rest of Asia and the world. Buddhist art traveled with believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art, until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century CE due in part to the vigorous expansion of Islam alongside     [[Hinduism]].

A common visual device in Buddhist art is the [[mandala]]. From a viewer's perspective, it represents schematically the ideal universe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blume|first1=Nancy|title=Exploring the Mandala|url=http://asiasociety.org/exploring-mandala|website=Asia Society|publisher=Asia Society|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Violatti|first1=Cristian|title=Mandala|url=https://www.ancient.eu/mandala/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of aspirants and adepts, a spiritual teaching tool, for establishing a [[temenos|sacred space]] and as an aid to [[meditation]] and [[trance]] induction. Its symbolic nature can help one "to access progressively deeper levels of the unconscious, ultimately assisting the meditator to experience a mystical sense of oneness with the ultimate unity from which the cosmos in all its manifold forms arises."&lt;ref&gt;See David Fontana: "Meditating with Mandalas", p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]] saw the mandala as ''"a representation of the center of the unconscious self,"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netreach.net/~nhojem/jung.htm Carl Jung and the Mandala] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024061549/http://www.netreach.net/~nhojem/jung.htm |date=October 24, 2009 }} Retrieved January 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and believed his paintings of mandalas enabled him to identify emotional disorders and work towards wholeness in personality.&lt;ref&gt;See C G Jung: ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', pp.186–197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bhutanese art==
{{Main article|Bhutanese art}}
[[File:Bhutanese thanka of Mt. Meru and the Buddhist Universe.jpg|thumb|upright|Bhutanese [[thanka]] of [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Mt. Meru]] and the Buddhist Universe, 19th century, [[Trongsa|Trongsa Dzong]], [[Trongsa|Trongsa, Bhutan]]]]

'''Bhutanese art''' is similar to the [[art of Tibet]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], with its pantheon of divine beings.

The major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu|Kagyu School]] and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma order is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]], who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find. The [[Terton|treasure finders]] ([[Terton|''tertön'']]) are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.

Each divine being is assigned special shapes, colors, and/or identifying objects, such as lotus, conch-shell, thunderbolt, and begging bowl. All sacred images are made to exact specifications that have remained remarkably unchanged for centuries.

Bhutanese art is particularly rich in bronzes of different kinds that are collectively known by the name ''Kham-so'' (made in [[Kham]]) even though they are made in Bhutan, because the technique of making them was originally imported from the eastern province of [[Tibet]] called Kham. Wall paintings and sculptures, in these regions, are formulated on the principal ageless ideals of Buddhist art forms. Even though their emphasis on detail is derived from Tibetan models, their origins can be discerned easily, despite the profusely embroidered garments and glittering ornaments with which these figures are lavishly covered. In the grotesque world of demons, the artists apparently had a greater freedom of action than when modeling images of divine beings.

The arts and crafts of Bhutan that represents the exclusive “spirit and identity of the Himalayan kingdom’ is defined as the art of ''Zorig Chosum'', which means the “thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan”; the thirteen crafts are carpentry, painting, paper making, blacksmithery, weaving, sculpting and many other crafts. The Institute of Zorig Chosum in [[Thimphu]] is the premier institution of traditional arts and crafts set up by the Government of Bhutan with the sole objective of preserving the rich culture and tradition of Bhutan and training students in all traditional art forms; there is another similar institution in eastern Bhutan known as Trashi Yangtse. Bhutanese rural life is also displayed in the ‘[[Folk Heritage Museum]]’ in Thimphu. There is also a ‘Voluntary Artists Studio’ in Thimphu to encourage and promote the art forms among the youth of Thimphu. The thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan and the institutions established in Thimphu to promote these art forms are:&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 104"&gt;Brown, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arts&gt;{{cite web|title= Bhutan:Arts &amp; Crafts|url=http://www.tourism.gov.bt/about-bhutan/arts-crafts|accessdate=June 7, 2010|publisher=Tourism Council of Bhutan:Government of Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cambodian art==
[[File:Fronton Cambodge Musée Guimet 9972.jpg|thumb|right|Stone carving at [[Banteay Srei]] ([[Angkor]])]]
{{Main article|Culture of Cambodia|Cambodian art|Khmer sculpture}}
'''Cambodian art''' and the culture of [[Cambodia]] has had a rich and varied history dating back many centuries and has been heavily influenced by [[India]]. In turn, Cambodia greatly influenced [[Thailand]], Laos and vice versa. Throughout Cambodia's long history, a major source of inspiration was from religion. Throughout nearly two millennium, a Cambodians developed a unique [[Khmer people|Khmer]] belief from the syncreticism of indigenous [[animistic]] beliefs and the Indian religions of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. Indian culture and civilization, including its language and arts reached mainland Southeast Asia around the 1st century CE. It is generally believed that seafaring merchants brought Indian customs and culture to ports along the gulf of Thailand and the Pacific while trading with China. The first state to benefit from this was [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]]. At various times, Cambodia culture also absorbed elements from [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Chinese culture|Chinese]], [[Culture of Laos|Lao]], and [[Thailand|Thai]] cultures.

===Visual arts of Cambodia===
[[File:Bayon Angkor Relief1.jpg|thumb|left|Stone bas-relief at [[Bayon]] temple depicting the [[Cambodia|Khmer]] army at war with the [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]], carved c. 1200 CE]]

The history of [[Visual arts of Cambodia]] stretches back centuries to ancient crafts; Khmer art reached its peak during the [[Angkor]] period. Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include textiles, non-textile [[weaving]], [[silversmithing]], [[stone carving]], [[lacquerware]], [[Pottery|ceramics]], [[wat]] [[murals]], and [[kite]]-making. Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.

'''Khmer sculpture''' refers to the stone sculpture of the [[Khmer Empire]], which ruled a territory based on modern Cambodia, but rather larger, from the 9th to the 13th century. The most celebrated examples are found in [[Angkor]], which served as the seat of the empire.

By the 7th century, Khmer sculpture begins to drift away from its Hindu influences – pre-Gupta for the Buddhist figures, Pallava for the Hindu figures – and through constant stylistic evolution, it comes to develop its own originality, which by the 10th century can be considered complete and absolute. Khmer sculpture soon goes beyond religious representation, which becomes almost a pretext in order to portray court figures in the guise of gods and goddesses. But furthermore, it also comes to constitute a means and end in itself for the execution of stylistic refinement, like a kind of testing ground. We have already seen how the social context of the Khmer kingdom provides a second key to understanding this art. But we can also imagine that on a more exclusive level, small groups of intellectuals and artists were at work, competing among themselves in mastery and refinement as they pursued a hypothetical perfection of style.
[[File:Fronton Cambodge Musée Guimet 9971.jpg|thumb|Relief from Angkor]]

The gods we find in Khmer sculpture are those of the two great religions of India, [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. And they are always represented with great iconographic precision, clearly indicating that learned priests supervised the execution of the works. Nonetheless, unlike those Hindu images which repeat an idealized stereotype, these images are treated with great realism and originality because they depict living models: the king and his court. The true social function of Khmer art was, in fact, the glorification of the [[aristocracy]] through these images of the gods embodied in the princes. In fact, the cult of the “deva-raja” required the development of an eminently aristocratic art in which the people were supposed to see the tangible proof of the sovereign’s divinity, while the aristocracy took pleasure in seeing itself – if, it’s true, in idealized form – immortalized in the splendour of intricate adornments, elegant dresses and extravagant jewelry.

The sculptures are admirable images of a gods, royal and imposing presences, though not without feminine sensuality, makes us think of important persons at the courts, persons of considerable power. The artists who sculpted the stones doubtless satisfied the primary objectives and requisites demanded by the persons who commissioned them. The sculptures represent the chosen divinity in the orthodox manner and succeed in portraying, with great skill and expertise, high figures of the courts in all of their splendour, in the attire, adornments and jewelry of a sophisticated beauty.

==Chinese art==
{{Main article|Chinese art|Chinese painting|Chinese ceramics|Chinese jade|Chinese calligraphy}}
'''Chinese art''' (Chinese: 中國藝術/中国艺术) has varied throughout its [[History of China|ancient history]], divided into periods by the ruling [[dynasties of China]] and changing technology. Different forms of art have been influenced by great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political leaders. Chinese art encompasses [[fine art]]s, [[folk art]]s and [[performance art]]s. Chinese art is art, whether modern or ancient, that originated in or is practiced in China or by Chinese artists or performers.

In the [[Song Dynasty]], poetry was marked by a lyric poetry known as [[Ci (poetry)|Ci]] (詞) which expressed feelings of desire, often in an adopted persona. Also in the Song dynasty, paintings of more subtle expression of landscapes appeared, with blurred outlines and mountain contours which conveyed distance through an impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. It was during this period that in painting, emphasis was placed on spiritual rather than emotional elements, as in the previous period. [[Kunqu]], the oldest extant form of Chinese opera developed during the Song Dynasty in [[Kunshan]], near present-day Shanghai. In the [[Yuan dynasty]], painting by the Chinese painter [[Zhao Mengfu]] (趙孟頫) greatly influenced later Chinese landscape painting, and the Yuan dynasty opera became a variant of Chinese opera which continues today as [[Cantonese opera]].

{{Main article|Indian art|Indian painting|Rangoli}}
'''Indian art''' can be classified into specific periods, each reflecting certain religious, political and cultural developments. The earliest examples are the [[petroglyph]]s such as those found in [[Bhimbetka]], some of them dating to before 5500&amp;nbsp;BC. The production of such works continued for several millenniums. 

The art of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] followed. Later examples include the carved [[column|pillars]] of [[Ellora]], Maharashtra [[States and territories of India|state]]. Other examples are the [[fresco]]es of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves]].

The contributions of the [[Mughal Empire]] to Indian art include [[Mughal painting]], a style of miniature painting heavily influenced by [[Persian miniature|Persian miniatures]], and [[Mughal architecture]]. 

During the [[British Raj]], [[modern Indian painting]] evolved as a result of combining traditional Indian and European styles. [[Raja Ravi Varma]] was a pioneer of this period. The [[Bengal School of Art|Bengal school of Art]] developed during this period, led by [[Abanindranath Tagore|Abanidranath Tagore]], [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Mukul Dey]] and [[Nandalal Bose]].

One of the most popular art forms in [[India]] is called [[Rangoli]]. It is a form of [[sandpainting]] decoration that uses finely ground white powder and colours, and is used commonly outside homes in India.

The visual arts (sculpture, painting and architecture) are tightly interrelated with the non-visual arts. According to [[Kapila Vatsyayan]], "Classical Indian architecture, sculpture, painting, literature (kaavya), music and dancing evolved their own rules conditioned by their respective media, but they shared with one another not only the underlying spiritual beliefs of the Indian religio-philosophic mind, but also the procedures by which the relationships of the symbol and the spiritual states were worked out in detail."

Insight into the unique qualities of Indian art is best achieved through an understanding of the philosophical thought, the broad cultural history, social, religious and political background of the artworks.

Specific periods: 	

*[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] of the ancient period (3500 [[BCE]] – present)
 	
*Islamic ascendancy (712–1757 [[Common Era|CE]])

*The colonial period (1757–1947)

*Modern and Postmodern art in India 

*Independence and the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] period (Post-1947)

'''Indonesian art''' and culture has been shaped by long [[interaction]] between original indigenous customs and multiple foreign influences. [[Indonesia]] is central along ancient [[Trade route|trading routes]] between the Far East and the Middle East, resulting in many cultural practices being strongly influenced by a multitude of [[eastern religions|religions]], including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and Islam, all strong in the major trading cities. The result is a complex cultural mixture very different from the original indigenous cultures.
Indonesia is not generally known for paintings, aside from the intricate and expressive [[Bali]]nese paintings, which often express natural scenes and themes from the traditional dances.

[[File:Kenyah mural painting.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] mural painting in Long Nawang, [[East Kalimantan]].]]
Other exceptions include indigenous [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] paint designs based on, as commonly found among [[Austronesian]] cultures, endemic natural motifs such as ferns, trees, dogs, hornbills and human figures. These are still to be found decorating the walls of Kenyah Dayak [[longhouse]]s in [[East Kalimantan]]'s Apo Kayan region.

Indonesia has a long-he [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s, but the art-form particularly flourished from the 8th century to the 10th century, both as stand-alone works of art, and also incorporated into temples.

[[File:Borobudur Relief Panel I.b119, 0972.jpg|right|thumb|Relief sculpture from [[Borobudur]] temple, c. 760–830&amp;nbsp;AD]]
Most notable are the hundreds of meters of relief sculpture at the temple of [[Borobudur]] in central [[Java]]. Approximately two miles of exquisite relief sculpture tell the story of the life of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and illustrate his teachings. The temple was originally home to 504 statues of the seated Buddha. This site, as with others in central Java, show a clear Indian influence.

Calligraphy, mostly based on the [[Qur'an]], is often used as decoration as Islam forbids naturalistic depictions. Some foreign painters have also settled in [[Indonesia]]. Modern Indonesian painters use a wide variety of styles and themes.

===Balinese art===

[[File:Kerta Gosa, Ramayana Scene, Bali 1543.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Balinese painting of [[Ramayana]] scene from Kerta Gosha, depicting Rama versus Dasamukha (Ravana).]]
'''Balinese art''' is art of [[Hindu]]-[[Java]]nese origin that grew from the work of artisans of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit Kingdom]], with their expansion to [[Bali]] in the late 13th century. From the 16th until the 20th centuries, the village of Kamasan, Klungkung (East Bali), was the centre of classical Balinese art. During the first part of the 20th century, new varieties of Balinese art developed. Since the late twentieth century, [[Ubud]] and its neighboring villages established a reputation as the center of Balinese art. Ubud and [[Batuan, Bali|Batuan]] are known for their paintings, [[Mas, Indonesia|Mas]] for their woodcarvings, Celuk for gold and silversmiths, and Batubulan for their stone carvings.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes Balinese art as, "... a highly developed, although informal Baroque folk art that combines the peasant liveliness with the refinement of classicism of Hinduistic Java, but free of the conservative prejudice and with a new vitality fired by the exuberance of the demonic spirit of the tropical primitive". Eiseman correctly pointed out that Balinese art is actually carved, painted, woven, and prepared into objects intended for everyday use rather than as ''object d 'art.''&lt;ref name="Eiseman"&gt;

In the 1920s, with the arrival of many western artists, Bali became an artist enclave (as [[Tahiti]] was for [[Paul Gauguin]]) for avant-garde artists such as [[Walter Spies]] (German), [[Rudolf Bonnet]] (Dutch), [[Adrien-Jean Le Mayeur]] (Belgian), [[Arie Smit]] (Dutch) and [[Donald Friend]] (Australian) in more recent years. Most of these western artists had very little influence on the Balinese until the post-World War Two period, although some accounts over-emphasise the western presence at the expense of recognising Balinese creativity.

This groundbreaking period of creativity reached a peak in the late 1930s. A stream of famous visitors, including [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the [[anthropologist]]s [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Margaret Mead]], encouraged the talented locals to create highly original works. During their stay in Bali in the mid-1930s, Bateson and Mead collected over 2000 paintings, predominantly from the village of Batuan, but also from the coastal village of Sanur.&lt;ref name="Geertz-Images_of_Power"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among western artists, Spies and Bonnet are often credited for the modernization of traditional Balinese paintings. From the 1950s onwards Baliese artists incorporated aspects of perspective and anatomy from these artists.&lt;ref name="JC"&gt;

More importantly, they acted as agents of change by encouraging experimentation, and promoted departures from tradition. The result was an explosion of individual expression that increased the rate of change in Balinese art.

'''Japanese art''' and architecture is works of art produced in Japan from the beginnings of human habitation there, sometime in the 10th millennium BC, to the present. Japanese art covers a wide range of art styles and media, including ancient pottery, sculpture in wood and bronze, ink painting on silk and paper, and a myriad of other types of works of art; from ancient times until the contemporary 21st century.

The art form rose to great popularity in the metropolitan culture of [[Edo]] (Tokyo) during the second half of the 17th century, originating with the single-color works of [[Hishikawa Moronobu]] in the 1670s. At first, only [[India ink]] was used, then some prints were manually colored with a brush, but in the 18th century [[Suzuki Harunobu]] developed the technique of polychrome printing to produce ''[[nishiki-e]].''
[[File:Hiroshige Snow falling on a town.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroshige]], ''Snow falling on a town'', c. 1833, [[ukiyo-e]] print]]
{{nihongo|'''Japanese painting'''|絵画|Kaiga}} is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. As with the history of Japanese arts in general, the history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas.

The origins of painting in Japan date well back into [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan's prehistoric period]]. Simple stick figures and geometric designs can be found on [[Jōmon period]] pottery and [[Yayoi period]] (300&amp;nbsp;BC – 300&amp;nbsp;AD) ''[[dōtaku]]'' bronze bells. [[Mural]] paintings with both geometric and figurative designs have been found in numerous [[tumulus]] from the [[Kofun period]] (300–700&amp;nbsp;AD).

Ancient '''Japanese sculpture''' was mostly derived from the [[idol worship]] in [[Buddhism]] or animistic rites of [[Shinto]] deity. In particular, sculpture among all the arts came to be most firmly centered around Buddhism. Materials traditionally used were metal—especially [[bronze]]—and, more commonly, wood, often [[lacquer]]ed, [[gilding|gilded]], or brightly painted. By the end of the [[Tokugawa period]], such traditional sculpture – except for miniaturized works – had largely disappeared because of the loss of patronage by Buddhist temples and the nobility.

''[[Ukiyo]]'', meaning "floating world", refers to the impetuous young culture that bloomed in the urban centers of [[Edo]] (modern-day Tokyo), [[Osaka]], and [[Kyoto]] that were a world unto themselves. It is an ironic allusion to the [[homophone]] term "Sorrowful World" (憂き世), the earthly plane of death and rebirth from which Buddhists sought release.

==Korean art==
[[File:Geumgangjeondo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeong Seon]], ''General View of Mt. Geumgang'' (금강전도, 金剛全圖), Korea, c.1734]]

{{Main article|Korean art|Korean painting|Korean calligraphy}}
'''Korean art''' is noted for its traditions in pottery, music, calligraphy, painting, sculpture, and other genres, often marked by the use of bold color, natural forms, precise shape and scale, and surface decoration.

While there are clear and distinguishing differences between three independent cultures, there are significant and historical similarities and interactions between the arts of [[Korea]], China and Japan.

The study and appreciation of [[Korean art]] is still at a formative stage in the West. Because of [[Korea]]’s position between China and Japan, Korea was seen as a mere conduit of Chinese culture to Japan. However, recent scholars have begun to acknowledge Korea’s own unique art, culture and important role in not only transmitting Chinese culture but assimilating it and creating a unique culture of its own. ''An art given birth to and developed by a nation is its own art.''

Generally, the history of '''Korean painting''' is dated to approximately 108 C.E., when it first appears as an independent form. Between that time and the paintings and frescoes that appear on the [[Goryeo]] dynasty tombs, there has been little research. Suffice to say that til the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty the primary influence was Chinese painting though done with Korean landscapes, facial features, Buddhist topics, and an emphasis on celestial observation in keeping with the rapid development of Korean astronomy.

Throughout the history of Korean painting, there has been a constant separation of monochromatic works of black brushwork on very often mulberry paper or silk; and the colourful folk art or ''min-hwa'', ritual arts, tomb paintings, and festival arts which had extensive use of colour.

This distinction was often class-based: scholars, particularly in [[Confucian art]] felt that one could see colour in monochromatic paintings within the gradations and felt that the actual use of colour coarsened the paintings, and restricted the imagination. Korean folk art, and painting of architectural frames was seen as brightening certain outside wood frames, and again within the tradition of Chinese architecture, and the early Buddhist influences of profuse rich thalo and primary colours inspired by [[Indian art|Art of India]].

'''Contemporary art in Korea:''' The first example of [[Western-style oil painting]] in Korean art was in the self-portraits of Korean artist [[Go Hui-dong|Ko Hu i-dong]] (1886-1965). Only three of these works still remain today. these self-portraits impart an understanding of medium that extends well beyond the affirmation of stylistic and cultural difference. by the early twentieth century, the decision to paint using oil and canvas in Korea had two different interpretations. One being a sense of enlightenment due to western ideas and art styles. This enlightenment derived from an intellectual movement of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Ko had been painting with this method during a period of Japans' annexation of Korea. During this time many claimed his art could have been political, however, he himself stated he was an artist and not a politician. Ko stated "While I was in Tokyo, a very curious thing happened. At that time there were fewer than one hundred Korean students in Tokyo. All of us were drinking the new air and embarking on new studies, but there were some who mocked my choice to study art. A close friend said that it was not right for me to study painting in such a time as this."  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kee|first=Joan|date=April 2013|title=Contemporary Art in Early Colonial Korea: The Self Portraits of Ko Hui-dong|url=|journal=Art History|volume=36|pages=392|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Korean pottery''' was recognized as early as 6000 BCE. This pottery was also referred to as comb-patterned pottery due to the decorative lines carved onto the outside. early Korean societies were mainly dependent on fishing. So, they used the pottery to store fish and other things collected from the ocean such as shellfish. Pottery had two main regional distinctions. Those from the East coast tends to have a flat base, whereas pottery on the South coast had a round base. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2007|title=Early Korean History|url=|journal=Early Korean history|volume=|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laotian art==
{{Main article|Lao art}}
[[File:Lan Xang - Seated Buddha - bronze.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lan Xang]] bronze Buddha, 17th century [[Laos]]]]
[[File:Stone carving in Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|Stone carvings, called Chaityas, seen even in street corners and courtyards of [[Kathmandu]]|298x298px]]
'''Laotian art''' includes [[Lao ceramics|ceramics]], [[Lao Buddhist sculpture]], and [[Lao music]].

Lao Buddhist sculptures were created in a large variety of material including gold, silver and most often [[bronze]]. Brick-and-mortar also was a medium used for colossal images, a famous of these is the image of ''Phya Vat'' (16th century) in [[Vientiane]], although a renovation completely altered the appearance of the sculpture, and it no longer resembles a Lao Buddha. Wood is popular for small, votive Buddhist images that are often left in caves. Wood is also very common for large, life-size standing images of the Buddha. The most famous two sculptures carved in semi-precious stone are the Phra Keo (The [[Emerald Buddha]]) and the Phra Phuttha Butsavarat. The Phra Keo, which is probably of Xieng Sen ([[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]]) origin, is carved from a solid block of jade. It rested in Vientiane for two hundred years before the Siamese carried it away as booty in the late 18th century. Today it serves as the [[palladium (mythology)|palladium]] of the Kingdom of Thailand, and resides at the [[Grand Palace]] in Bangkok. The Phra Phuttha Butsavarat, like the Phra Keo, is also enshrined in its own chapel at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. Before the Siamese seized it in the early 19th century, this crystal image was the palladium of the Lao kingdom of [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champassack]].

Many beautiful Lao Buddhist sculptures are carved right into the [[Pak Ou caves]]. Near ''Pak Ou'' (mouth of the Ou river) the ''Tham Ting'' (lower cave) and the ''Tham Theung'' (upper cave) are near [[Luang Prabang]], Laos. They are a magnificent group of caves that are only accessible by boat, about two hours upstream from the center of [[Luang Prabang]], and have recently become more well known and frequented by tourists.The caves are noted for their impressive [[Buddhist]] and [[Laotian art|Lao]] style sculptures carved into the cave walls, and hundreds of discarded [[Buddhist]] figures laid out over the floors and wall shelves. They were put there as their owners did not wish to destroy them, so a difficult journey is made to the caves to place their unwanted statue there.

==Nepalese art==
{{see also|Culture of Kathmandu|Culture of Nepal}}
The ancient and refined traditional '''culture of [[Kathmandu]]''', for that matter in the whole of '''[[Nepal]],''' is an uninterrupted and exceptional meeting of the [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] ethos practiced by its highly religious people. It has also embraced in its fold the cultural diversity provided by the other religions such as [[Jainism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].

==Thai art==
{{Main article|Thai art}}
[[File:Suphannahongsa bow.jpg|thumb|left|The bow of [[Royal Barge Procession|Royal Barge]] Suphannahong of Thailand. |222px]]
'''Thai art''' and [[Thai art|visual art]] was traditionally and primarily [[Buddhist art|Buddhist]] and Royal Art. Sculpture was almost exclusively of [[Buddha image]]s, while painting was confined to [[illustration]] of books and decoration of buildings, primarily [[palace]]s and temples. Thai [[Buddha image]]s from different periods have a number of distinctive styles. Contemporary Thai art often combines traditional Thai elements with [[modern art|modern]] techniques.

Traditional Thai paintings showed subjects in two [[dimension]]s without [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The size of each element in the picture reflected its degree of importance. The primary technique of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] is that of apportioning areas: the main elements are isolated from each other by space transformers. This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of Western influence in the mid-19th century.

The most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the [[Jataka]] stories, episodes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the Buddhist [[heaven]]s and [[hell]]s, and scenes of daily life.

The Sukhothai period began in the 14th century in the [[Sukhothai kingdom]]. Buddha images of the Sukhothai period are elegant, with sinuous bodies and slender, oval faces. This style emphasized the spiritual aspect of the Buddha, by omitting many small [[anatomy|anatomical]] details. The effect was enhanced by the common practice of [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] images in metal rather than [[Wikt:carving|carving]] them. This period saw the introduction of the "walking Buddha" pose.

Sukhothai artists tried to follow the canonical defining marks of a Buddha, as they are set out in ancient [[Pāli|Pali]] texts:
*[[Human skin|Skin]] so smooth that dust cannot stick to it; 
*[[human leg|Leg]]s like a deer;
*[[Thigh]]s like a [[banyan tree]];
*[[Shoulder]]s as massive as an elephant's head;
*Arms round like an elephant's trunk, and long enough to touch the knees;
*Hands like lotuses about to bloom;
*[[Fingertip]]s turned back like petals;
*[[human head|head]] like an egg;
*Hair like scorpion stingers;
*[[Chin]] like a mango stone;
*[[Human nose|Nose]] like a parrot's beak;
*[[Earlobe]]s lengthened by the earrings of royalty;
*[[Eyelash]]es like a cow's;
*[[Eyebrow]]s like drawn bows.

Sukhothai also produced a large quantity of [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]d [[ceramic]]s in the [[Sawankhalok]] style, which were traded throughout south-east Asia.

==Tibetan art==
[[File:Amazing sand mandala.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Sand mandala]] displaying its materials]]
{{Main article|Tibetan art|Sand mandala}}

'''Tibetan art''' refers to the art of [[Tibet]] and other present and former [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] kingdoms ([[Bhutan]], [[Ladakh]], Nepal, and [[Sikkim]]). Tibetan art is first and foremost a form of [[sacred art]], reflecting the over-riding influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] on these cultures. The Sand Mandala ([[Tibetic languages|Tib]]: ''kilkhor'') is a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition which symbolises the transitory nature of things. As part of [[Buddhist]] canon, all things material are seen as transitory. A sand [[mandala]] is an example of this, being that once it has been built and its accompanying ceremonies and viewing are finished, it is systematically [[Art destruction|destroyed]].

As [[Mahayana Buddhism]] emerged as a separate school in the 4th century BC it emphasized the role of [[bodhisattva]]s, compassionate beings who forgo their personal escape to [[Nirvana]] in order to assist others. From an early time various bodhisattvas were also subjects of statuary art. Tibetan Buddhism, as an offspring of Mahayana Buddhism, inherited this tradition. But the additional dominating presence of the [[Vajrayana]] (or Buddhist tantra) may have had an overriding importance in the artistic culture. A common bodhisattva depicted in Tibetan art is the deity [[Chenrezig]] (Avalokitesvara), often portrayed as a thousand-armed saint with an eye in the middle of each hand, representing the all-seeing compassionate one who hears our requests. This deity can also be understood as a [[Yidam]], or 'meditation Buddha' for Vajrayana practice.

Tibetan Buddhism contains [[Tantric Buddhism]], also known as [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism for its common symbolism of the ''vajra'', the diamond thunderbolt (known in [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] as the [[dorje]]). Most of the typical Tibetan Buddhist art can be seen as part of the practice of tantra. Vajrayana techniques incorporate many visualizations/imaginations during meditation, and most of the elaborate tantric art can be seen as aids to these visualizations; from representations of meditational deities ([[yidam]]s) to [[mandala]]s and all kinds of ritual implements.
[[File:Mantras caved into rock in Tibet.jpg|thumb|In [[Tibet]], many [[Buddhist]]s carve mantras into rocks as a form of devotion.]]
A visual aspect of Tantric Buddhism is the common representation of [[wrathful deities]], often depicted with angry faces, circles of flame, or with the skulls of the dead. These images represent the ''Protectors'' ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]. [[dharmapala]]) and their fearsome bearing belies their true compassionate nature. Actually, their wrath represents their dedication to the protection of the [[dharma]] teaching as well as to the protection of the specific tantric practices to prevent corruption or disruption of the practice. They are most importantly used as wrathful psychological aspects that can be used to conquer the negative attitudes of the practitioner.

Historians note that [[Chinese painting]] had a profound influence on Tibetan painting in general. Starting from the 14th and 15th century, Tibetan painting had incorporated many elements from the Chinese, and during the 18th century, Chinese painting had a deep and far-stretched impact on Tibetan visual art.&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;McKay, Alex. The History of Tibet. Routledge. 2003. p. 596-597. {{ISBN|0-7007-1508-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Giuseppe Tucci]], by the time of the Qing Dynasty, "a new Tibetan art was then developed, which in a certain sense was a provincial echo of the Chinese 18th century's smooth ornate preciosity."&lt;ref name=McKay/&gt;

==Vietnamese art==
[[File:Ngoc Lu bronze drum surface.gif|thumb|upright|Ngoc Lu bronze drum's surface, 2nd to 3rd century BCE]]

{{Main article|Vietnamese art}}
'''Vietnamese art''' is from one of the oldest of such cultures in the Southeast Asia region. A rich artistic heritage that dates to prehistoric times and includes: silk painting, sculpture, pottery, ceramics, woodblock prints, architecture, music, dance and theatre.
[[File:To Ngoc Van thieu nu ben hoa hue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Tô Ngọc Vân, ''Thiếu nữ bên hoa huệ (Young Woman with Lily)'', 1943, oil]]
[[Vietnamese art|Traditional Vietnamese art]] is art practiced in Vietnam or by Vietnamese artists, from ancient times (including the elaborate [[Đông Sơn drums]]) to post-[[History of Vietnam|Chinese domination]] art which was strongly influenced by [[Buddhist art|Chinese Buddhist art]], among other philosophies such as [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The art of [[Champa]] and [[French art]] also played a smaller role later on.



The Chinese influence on Vietnamese art extends into [[Vietnamese ceramics|Vietnamese pottery and ceramics]], calligraphy, and traditional architecture. Currently, Vietnamese lacquer paintings have proven to be quite popular.

The [[Nguyễn dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam (c. 1802–1945), saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art. Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.

Despite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguyễn dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguyễn dynasty.

Beginning in the 19th century, [[modern art]] and French artistic influences spread into Vietnam. In the early 20th century, the École Supérieure des Beaux Arts de l’Indochine (Indochina College of Arts) was founded to teach European methods and exercised influence mostly in the larger cities, such as [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx Art History – A Brief History Of Vietnam Fine Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304044904/http://vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx |date=March 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel restrictions imposed on the Vietnamese during France's 80-year rule of Vietnam and the long period of war for national independence meant that very few Vietnamese artists were able to train or work outside of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="vcw"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ngoc|first=Huu|year=2000|title=Modern Painting: Tracing the Roots|journal=Vietnam Cultural Window|publisher=Thế Giới Publishers|volume=29|url=http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&amp;idmagazines=267|accessdate=April 23, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013739/http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&amp;idmagazines=267|archivedate=March 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}} [http://www.particulargallery.com/Articles/Articles5.aspx Full text available here]&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of artists from well-to-do backgrounds had the opportunity to go to France and make their careers there for the most part.&lt;ref name="vcw"/&gt; Examples include Le Thi Luu, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Le Van De, Le Ba Dang and Pham Tang.&lt;ref name="vcw"/&gt;

Modern Vietnamese artists began to utilize French techniques with many traditional mediums such as silk, lacquer, etc., thus creating a unique blend of eastern and western elements.

===Vietnamese calligraphy===
Calligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using [[Chinese characters]] along with [[chữ nôm]]. However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based [[Quốc Ngữ]], which has proven to be very popular.

In the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life. On special occasions such as the [[Tết|Lunar New Year]], people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words). People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at temple shrines.

==Filipino art==

[[File:Filipino Painting 12.jpg|left|thumb|285x285px|[[José Honorato Lozano]] painting of Calle Sebastian, Quiapo, Manila in the mid-1800s with its iconic [[Bahay na bato]] architectures. The painting style strongly indicates a melting pot of east and west that resulted to its own originality.]]
[[Philippines|Filipino]] identity was born at the same time as its creation, Mainly from its Pre-Colonial/Pre-Philippines Cultures that merged with the influenced of the Colonizers and Chinese traders that melted and evolved to its own unique Classical Filipino Identity. Before the Philippines was born, It was a divided set of nations, islands and tribes being ruled by their own specific Social Kings, Chieftains, Lakans, Datus, Rajahs and Sultans.  Every nation has its own identity and some are even part of a larger Empire outside of the modern day map of what is now the Philippines, for example; [[Manila]] was once part of the [[Bruneian Empire]]. Another example is many parts of the modern day [[Mindanao]] is [[theorized]] to be part of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit empire]] with its capital being located in [[East Java]] in the modern day [[Indonesia]]. The Advent of the Colonial arrival to the islands started The modern day Philippines, as it was during that time that what is now a united islands of today now known as the Philippines was created. The [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] influenced has been felt throughout [[Southeast Asia]] through trade, even before the Colonization of the region specifically [[Ming dynasty]] and other earlier dynasties as early as the 9th century. But it was during the Spanish colonization that modern day Chinese Filipino signature-mark on what is now the Philippines was developed. These cultures the melted from pre-colonial internal and external influence is very evident in the Pre-modern arts and tradition of the Philippines. Paintings of [[José Honorato Lozano]] has clear indication of East and West influence.
[[File:0201jfSan Agustin Church Museum Manilafvf 07.jpg|thumb|Filipino Baroque is Baroque incorporating motifs based on Filipino Culture, Environment  and everyday life ]]
Kutkut art is another technique of combining ancient Oriental and European art process. Considered lost art and highly collectible art form. Very few known art pieces existed today. The technique was practiced by the indigenous people of Samar Island between early 1600 and late 1800 A.D. ''Kut-kut'' is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques—sgraffito, encaustic and layering. The merging of these ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines, multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space. The Filipino signature is also very evident in architecture. One famous examples of this is how the Philippines intentionally adapted the [[Baroque]] style of architecture which is famous in Europe at that time to the earthquake-prone environment of the Philippines with ornamentation portraying Philippine culture, environment and everyday life incorporating local motifs, for example; using things such as Banana leaves which is very common in the Philippines. This became known as the [[Baroque Churches of the Philippines|Filipino Baroque]] with the [[Earthquake Baroque]] being its famous variant that is present in the famous churches of the Philippines. Some Pre-Colonial art has made its way to the modern Filipino society especially in the Mindanao and other uncolonized parts of the Philippines one example of this is the [[Sarimanok]] symbolism on art.

'''''How Music Works''''' is a non-fiction book by [[David Byrne]], a musician, writer, and public figure best known for his work with the group [[Talking Heads]]. He discusses the form and influence of music in a non-linear narrative fashion, using a variety of experiences from his career to create something part [[autobiography]] and part [[music theory]]. The book was published through [[McSweeney's]] on September 12, 2012, and was named as one of [[Amazon.com]]'s "Best Books of the Month" in that same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000829021|title=Best Books of the Month: September 2012|accessdate=November 3, 2012|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=keens/&gt; It has received mainly positive reviews.&lt;ref name=keens/&gt;&lt;ref name=club/&gt;&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt;&lt;ref name=post/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Contents==
[[File:Talking Heads band3.jpg|thumb|Talking Heads performing at [[Horseshoe Tavern]] in [[Toronto]] in 1978.]]

The book, despite being non-fiction, has a highly non-linear structure with manual-like information, elements of Byrne's [[autobiography]], and anthropological data on [[music theory]] all intermixed, each chapter able to stand alone. Byrne looks at the influence of music, even in such subtle forms as birdsongs, from a rational perspective that eschews [[romanticism]].&lt;ref name=keens/&gt; Overall, he writes that no music "is aimed exclusively at either the body or the head", with complex human beings interacting with it on different levels.&lt;ref name=club/&gt;

He discusses his career with [[Talking Heads]], detailing many points of background for their music. He describes how the lyrics to the 1980 song "[[Once in a Lifetime (Talking Heads song)|Once in a Lifetime]]" drew inspiration from a recording of a preacher as well as how the oversize suits worn in their [[concert film]] ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'' drew inspiration from ancient Japanese theatre.&lt;ref name=keens/&gt; Byrne avoids bringing back up the personality conflicts leading to the band's demise, and he instead goes through their history, [[Talking Heads discography|album by album]], to detail his views on performances versus recordings as well as the effects of money and fame. In particular, he spends a chapter on the [[CBGB]] [[nightclub]] and the underlying conditions that supported the development of new, avant-garde artists such as [[Patti Smith]], [[the Ramones]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], and others besides his own band.&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-byrne/how-music-works/|publisher=''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''|accessdate=November 3, 2012|title=HOW MUSIC WORKS|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrne writes,
{{quote|"I’ve made money, and I’ve been ripped off... I’ve had creative freedom, and I’ve been pressured to make hits. I have dealt with diva behavior from crazy musicians, and I have seen genius records by wonderful artists get completely ignored... If you think success in the world of music is determined by the number of records sold, or the size of your house or bank account, then I’m not the expert for you. I am more interested in how people can manage a whole lifetime in music."&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinion/how-music-works-by-david-byrne/2012/09/22/341d210e-fb73-11e1-b2af-1f7d12fe907a_story.html|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|title="How Music Works" by David Byrne|date=September 22, 2012|author=[[Tim Page (music critic)|Tim Page]]|accessdate=November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reviews==
A supportive review ran in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', with Oliver Keens stating that "David Byrne deserves great praise". Keens referred to the book as "as accessible as pop yet able to posit deep and startlingly original thoughts and discoveries in almost every paragraph", and he added that "this book will make you hear music in a different way." He remarked as well that "Talking Heads fans will find much to savour" and that "Byrne shows not just how music works, but how music publishing should work too."&lt;ref name=keens&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/artsandentertainmentbooksreview/9573776/How-Music-Works-by-David-Byrne-review.html|title=How Music Works by David Byrne: review|date=1 October 2012|accessdate=3 November 2012|first=Oliver|last=Keens|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The A.V. Club]]'' also published a positive review. Critic Jason Heller remarked that "joy—of singing and playing, of thinking and dancing, of listening and wondering—renders almost every page a song." In addition, he wrote, "Byrne’s knack for paradox and passion carries his erratic narrative."&lt;ref name=club&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/david-byrne-how-music-works,84993/|first=Jason|last=Heller|date=September 17, 2012|accessdate=November 3, 2012|publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]''|title=David Byrne: How Music Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' critic [[Tim Page (critic)|Tim Page]] commented, "This is a decidedly generous book—welcoming, informal, digressive, full of ideas and intelligence—and one has the pleasant sense that Byrne is speaking directly to the reader, sharing a few confidences he has picked up over the years." Stating that "Byrne has plenty of smart things to say about pop music", Page lauded the "ambitious" work.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' praised the book as "a supremely intelligent, superbly written dissection of music as an art form and way of life." The magazine stated in addition that "anyone at all interested in music will learn a lot from this book."&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt;

On the other hand, for ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]], the book is "a roll of mental wallpaper, a textbook for a survey course you didn’t mean to sign up for. It drifts between music history, sonic anthropology, mild biographical asides, broad pop theory and grandfatherly financial and artistic advice. It’s all the things Mr. Byrne’s twitchy and alienated music with Talking Heads never was: genial, well-meaning, as forgettable as a real estate agent’s handshake." &lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/books/how-music-works-by-david-byrne.html?_r=0|first=Dwight|last=Garner|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=February 23, 2013|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|title=A Talking Head Has Something to Say. ‘How Music Works,’ by David Byrne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How Sex Works: Why We Look, Smell, Taste, Feel, and Act the Way We Do'''''' is a 2009 book by [[evolutionary biologist]] and ''[[New York Times]]'' [[Bestselling book|bestselling author]] [[Sharon Moalem]], published by [[HarperCollins]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web|last=Cruz|first=Gilbert|title=How Sex Works|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1895544,00.html|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oprah&gt;{{cite web|last=Winter|first=Jessica|title=Between the Covers|url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/How-Sex-Works-by-Sharon-Moalem-Book-Review|publisher=Oprah}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book examines the scientific reasons people are attracted to one another including the evolutionary underpinnings of [[sexual attraction]], [[monogamy]], and [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|title=EXCERPT: 'How Sex Works'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Books/story?id=7472408|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Lynn|title=Lynn Harris Reviews 'Behind the Bedroom Door,' 'How Sex Works,'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/21/AR2009072102755.html|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''How Sex Works'' uses [[evolutionary biology]] to explore human sexuality, and how sexuality can influence society in terms of human relations and belief systems. The author examines the physiological purpose behind how sensory data is interpreted by the human body and its effect on human sexuality.&lt;ref name=Kirkus&gt;{{cite web|title=HOW SEX WORKS Why We Look, Smell, Taste, Feel, and Act the Way We Do|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sharon-moalem/how-sex-works/|publisher=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moalem arguest that menstruation, fertility, penis size, orgasm, ejaculation and contraception all have traces back to the “[[survival of the fittest]]” and human's desire to find a healthy partner for reproduction.&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{cite web|title=The Daily Beast Recommends|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2009/04/28/the-daily-beast-recommends-7.html|publisher=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book covers other evolutionary factors influencing sexual attraction include pheremones, genetic makeup, immune system compatibility and ovulation.&lt;ref name=tbt&gt;{{cite web|last=A. Miller|first=Jen|title=Review: 'How Sex Works: Why We Look, Smell, Taste, Feel, and Act the Way We Do,' by Dr. Sharon Moalem|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/health/review-how-sex-works-why-we-look-smell-taste-feel-and-act-the-way-we-do/1003125|publisher=Tampa Bay Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book uses various examples to illustrate the author's central point, including:&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref name=oprah/&gt;
* Body scents are linked to strength of immune systems, signaling potential mates on the viability of producing healthy offspring
* Brazilian waxes have become more desirable as our subconscious attempts to eradicate pubic lice
* Men watching pornography with other men in the shot (along with a female) can lead to increased sperm production due to the perceived competition
* Women are more likely to fantasize about men who aren't their partners during ovulation, more likely to lead to fraternal twins
* Men are attracted to women with low waist-to-hip ratio (hourglass shape) because fatty acids stored in hip fat aid brain development in fetuses and lead to smarter children

[[Kirkus Reviews]] called the book "provocative and entertaining" describing it as "a volume stuffed with information that avoids getting bogged down in difficult medical terms or complex biological concepts."&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

[[File:How to draw manga.jpg|thumb|The cover of ''How to Draw Manga: Bodies &amp; Anatomy'']]
'''''How to Draw Manga''''' is a series of instructional books on drawing [[manga]] published by Graphic-sha, by a variety of authors. Originally in Japanese for the Japanese market, many volumes have been translated into English and published in the United States. Of the wide range of manga-how-tos available for westerners, the series is seen as one of the more useful, both for its provenance and wide range of practical tips.{{ref|twoeasylessons}} The English-language volumes in the series were co-produced by Graphic-sha and two other Japanese companies, Japanime Co. Ltd. and Japan Publications Trading Co.

== List of books in the series ==
This is a list of books in the main ''HTDM'' set and other sets that relate to the main series.

Originally there were no volume numbers on the English versions, because the original [[Japanese language|Japanese]] version did not have them. Only volumes 1 - 8 were given numbers. With continued reprints and more books being released, all volumes gained a number. The dates given are the first printing. Several of these books have been discontinued, and are considered hard to find.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13198">The '''Institut für Sexualwissenschaft''' was an early private [[sexology]] research institute in Germany from 1919 to 1933. The name is variously translated as ''Institute of Sex Research'', ''Institute of Sexology'', ''Institute for Sexology'' or ''Institute for the Science of Sexuality''. The Institute was a non-profit foundation situated in [[Tiergarten, Berlin]]. It was headed by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. Since 1897 he had run the ''[[Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee]]'' ("Scientific-Humanitarian Committee"), which campaigned on conservative and rational grounds for [[gay rights]] and tolerance. The Committee published the long-running journal ''[[Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen]]''. Hirschfeld built a unique library on same-sex love and eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Oosterhuis. (Ed.) ''Homosexuality and Male Bonding in Pre-Nazi Germany: The Youth Movement, the Gay Movement, and Male Bonding Before Hitler's Rise: Original Transcripts from Der Eigene, the First Gay Journal in the World''. (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Nazi book burnings]] in Berlin included the archives of the Institute. After the Nazis gained control of Germany in the 1930s, the institute and its libraries were destroyed as part of a [[Censorship in Nazi Germany|Nazi government censorship]] program by youth brigades, who burned its books and documents in the street.&lt;ref name="Qualia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Sexology|url=http://www.qualiafolk.com/2011/12/08/institute-of-sexology/|website=qualiafolk.com|publisher=Qualia Folk|accessdate=18 January 2015|date=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and purpose==
[[File:Hedwig W. and friend (ca 1922).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Herbert W. (left) was a transgender friend of Magnus Hirschfeld, and lived for two years in Berlin under his chosen name. This photo is from Hirschfeld's ''Sexual Intermediates'' (1922).]]The ''Institute of Sex Research'' was opened in 1919 by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and his collaborator [[Arthur Kronfeld]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgipt.org/gesch/kronf/kronf_e.htm ''In Memory of Arthur Kronfeld''])&lt;/ref&gt; a once famous psychotherapist and later professor at the [[Charité]]. As well as being a research library and housing a large archive, the Institute also included medical, psychological, and ethnological divisions, and a marriage and sex counseling office. The Institute was visited by around 20,000 people each year, and conducted around 1,800 consultations. Poorer visitors were treated for free. In addition, the institute advocated [[sex education]], [[contraception]], the treatment of [[sexually transmitted diseases]], and [[feminism|women's emancipation]], and was a pioneer worldwide in the call for civil rights and social acceptance for homosexual and [[transgender]] people.

The Institute became a point of scientific and research interest for many scientists of sexuality, as well as scientific, political and social reformers in Germany and Europe, particularly from socialist, liberal and social-democratic circles. In 1923 the Institute was visited by [[Nikolai Semashko (medicine)|Nikolai Semashko]], Commissar for Health in the Soviet Union. This was followed by numerous visits and research trips by health officials, political, sexual and social reformers, and scientific researchers from the Soviet Union interested in the work of Hirschfeld.&lt;ref&gt;Homosexual Desire in Revolutionary Russia: The Regulation of Sexual and Gender Dissent, Dan Healey, 2001, pp.132-133&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 a delegation from the institute, led by Hirschfeld, reciprocated with a research visit to Moscow. In 1929 Hirschfeld presided over the third international congress of the [[World League for Sexual Reform]] at [[Wigmore Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Times]], ''League For Sexual Reform International Congress Opened'', 9 September 1929;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Transgender pioneers==
Magnus Hirschfeld coined the term [[transsexualism]],&lt;ref&gt;Ekins R., King D. (2001) ''Pioneers of Transgendering: The Popular Sexology of David O. Cauldwell.'' IJT 5,2 ([http://www.symposion.com/ijt/cauldwell/cauldwell_01.htm  text online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428021447/http://www.symposion.com/ijt/cauldwell/cauldwell_01.htm |date=2006-04-28 }})&lt;/ref&gt; identifying the clinical category which his colleague [[Harry Benjamin]] would later develop in the United States. Transgender people were on the staff of the Institute, as well as being among the clients there. Various endocrinologic and surgical services were offered, including the first modern sex reassignment surgeries in the 1930s. Hirschfeld also worked with Berlin's police department to curtail the arrest of cross-dressed individuals, including those suspected of wearing certain clothing in connection with sex work, through the creation of [[transvestite]] passes issued on behalf of the Institute to those who had a personal desire to wear clothing associated with a gender other than the one assigned to them at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aO7YCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=gay+berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ7az2qKHWAhVETSYKHWznCn0QuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity|last=Beachy|first=Robert|date=2015|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=|isbn=0307473139|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/12/17/371424790/between-world-wars-gay-culture-flourished-in-berlin|title=Between World Wars, Gay Culture Flourished In Berlin|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They later attacked it, looting the archives, and setting afire much of the material.|alt=|left]]
[[Image:Vitahomosexualis.JPG|thumb|''Vita homosexualis'', a 1902 collection of August Fleischmann’s popular pamphlets on [[third gender]] and against [[§175]] - a [[Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee]] library copy, confiscated on 6 May 1933, annotated on the endpaper: ''By [[Reichspräsident]]’s [[Reichstag Fire Decree|decree of 28.02.1933]] destined [[Nazi_book_burnings|for destruction]]!'' and hidden from the publique (label "Secr.") as [[Nazi plunder]] by the [[Prussian State Library]].

This book, and other that may have survived the destruction of the Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee and the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft, are sought after by the Magnus-Hirschfeld-Gesellschaft in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://magnus-hirschfeld.de/bibliothek-und-archiv/sammlungsschwerpunkte/gesucht-und-gefunden/|title=Dinge, die wir suchen|website=magnus-hirschfeld.de|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]]In late February 1933, as the influence of [[Ernst Röhm]] weakened, the Nazi Party launched its purge of gay (then known as ''[[homophile]]'') clubs in Berlin, outlawed sex publications, and banned organised [[gay]] groups. As a consequence, many fled Germany (including, for instance, [[Erika Mann]]). In March 1933 the Institute's main administrator, [[Kurt Hiller]], was sent to a concentration camp. The buildings were later taken over by the Nazis for their own purposes. They were a bombed-out ruin by 1944, and were demolished sometime in the mid-1950s. Hirschfeld tried, in vain, to re-establish his Institute in Paris, but he died in France in 1935.

On 6 May 1933, while Hirschfeld was in [[Ascona]], Switzerland, the ''[[Deutsche Studentenschaft]]'' made an organised attack on the Institute of Sex Research. A few days later, the Institute's library and archives were publicly hauled out and [[Nazi book burnings|burned]] in the streets of the [[Opernplatz (Berlin)|Opernplatz]]. Around 20,000 books and journals, and 5,000 images, were destroyed. Also seized were the Institute's extensive lists of names and addresses. In the midst of the burning, [[Joseph Goebbels]] gave a political speech to a crowd of around 40,000 people. The leaders of the Deutsche Studentenschaft also proclaimed their own ''Feuersprüche'' (fire decrees). Also books by Jewish writers, and pacifists such as [[Erich Maria Remarque]], were removed from local public libraries and the [[Humboldt University]], and were burned.&lt;ref&gt;Leonidas Hill (2001). "The Nazi Attack on 'Un-German' Literature, 1933-1945" IN: ''The Holocaust and the Book: Destruction and Preservation''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many fled into exile, the radical activist [[Adolf Brand]] made a stand in Germany for five months after the book burnings, but in November 1933 he was forced to announce the formal end of the organised homosexual emancipation movement in Germany. On 28 June 1934 Hitler conducted a purge of gay men in the ranks of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] wing of the Nazis, which involved murdering them in the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. This was then followed by stricter laws on homosexuality and the round-up of gay men. The address lists seized from the Institute are believed to have aided Hitler in these actions. Many tens of thousands of arrestees found themselves, ultimately, in slave-labour or death camps. Karl Giese committed suicide in 1938 when the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia and his heir, lawyer Karl Fein, was murdered in 1942 during deportation.

==After World War II==
The charter of the institute had specified that in the event of dissolution, any assets of the Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld Foundation (which had sponsored the Institute since 1924) were to be donated to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. Hirschfeld also wrote a personal will while in exile in Paris, leaving any remaining assets to his students and heirs Karl Giese and Li Shiu Tong (Tao Li) for the continuation of his work. However, neither stipulation was carried out. The West German courts found that the foundation's dissolution and the seizure of property by the Nazis in 1934 was legal. The West German legislature also retained the Nazi amendments to [[Paragraph 175]], making it impossible for surviving gay men to claim restitution for the destroyed cultural center.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Steakley. ''The Early Homosexual Emancipation Movement in Germany''. (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

Li Shiu Tong lived in Switzerland and the United States until 1956, but as far as is known, he did not attempt to continue Hirschfeld's work. Some remaining fragments of data from the library were later collected by [[W. Dorr Legg]] and [[ONE, Inc.]] in the USA in the 1950s.

== Later developments ==
[[Image:Berlin hirschfeld gedenktafel.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Memorial to [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and his Institute for Sex Research, Berlin [[Tiergarten (park)|Tiergarten]], 2005]]
In 1973 a new ''Institut für Sexualwissenschaft'' was opened at the University of Frankfurt am Main (director: [[Volkmar Sigusch]]), and 1996 at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].

'''Interpersonal deception theory'''
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Interpersonal.png|thumb]] --&gt;
('''IDT''') attempts to explain how individuals handle actual (or perceived) deception at the conscious or subconscious level while engaged in face-to-face communication. IDT assumes that communication is not static; it is influenced by personal goals and the meaning of the interaction as it unfolds. The sender's overt (and covert) communications are affected by the overt and covert communications of the receiver, and vice versa. Intentional deception requires greater cognitive exertion than truthful communication, regardless of whether the sender attempts falsification ([[Lie|lying]]), [[:wikt:concealment|concealment]] (omitting material facts) or [[equivocation]] (skirting issues by changing the subject or responding indirectly). IDT explores the interrelation between the sender's communicative meaning and the receiver's thoughts and behavior in deceptive exchanges.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Theoretical perspective{{anchor|Theoretical Perspective}}==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Theoretical.png|thumb]] --&gt;
IDT views deception through the lens of interpersonal communication, considering deception as an interactive process between sender and receiver. In contrast with previous studies of deception (which focused on the sender and receiver individually), IDT focuses on the [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] and relational nature of deceptive communication. Behaviors by sender and receiver are dynamic, multifunctional, multidimensional and multi-modal.&lt;ref&gt;Buller and Burgoon, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyadic communication is communication between two people; a dyad is a group of two people between whom messages are sent and received. Relational communication is communication in which meaning is created by two people simultaneously filling the roles of sender and receiver. [[Dialogic]] activity is the active communicative language of the sender and receiver, each relying upon the other in the exchange.

In [[psychotherapy]] and psychological counseling, dyadic, relational and dialogic activity between therapist and patient relies on honest, open communication if the patient is to recover and be capable of healthier relationships. Deception uses the same theoretical framework in reverse; the communication of one participant is deliberately false.

==History==
[[Sigmund Freud]] studied nonverbal cues to detect deception about a century ago. Freud observed a patient being asked about his darkest feelings. If his mouth was shut and his fingers were trembling, he was considered to be lying. In 1989, DePaulo and Kirkendol developed the Motivation Impairment Effect (MIE). MIE states the harder people try to deceive others, the more likely they are to get caught. Burgoon and Floyd, however, revisited this research and formed the idea that deceivers are more active in their attempt to deceive than most would anticipate or expect.

IDT was developed by two communication professors, David B. Buller and [[Judee K. Burgoon]]. Prior to their study, deception had not been fully considered as a communication activity. Previous work had focused upon the formulation of principles of deception. These principles were derived by evaluating the lie detection ability of individuals observing unidirectional communication. These early studies found initially that "although humans are far from infallible in their efforts to diagnose lies, they are substantially better at the task than would result merely by chance." Buller and Burgoon discount the value of highly controlled studies – usually one-way communication experiments – designed to isolate unmistakable cues that people are lying. Therefore, IDT is based on two-way communication and intended to describe deception as an interaction communicative process.&lt;ref&gt;https://managingresearchlibrary.org/glossary/communicative-interaction&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|18 Propositions|18 propositions}}Propositions==
IDT's model of interpersonal deception has 18 verifiable propositions. Based on assumptions of interpersonal communication and deception, each proposition can generate a testable hypothesis. Although some propositions originated in IDT, many are derived from earlier research. The propositions attempt to explain the cognition and behavior of sender and receiver during the process of deception, from before interaction through interaction to the outcome after interaction.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"&gt;Buller and Burgoon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|The Superordinate Role of Context and Relationship|The superordinate role of context and relationship}}Context and relationship===
IDT's explanations of interpersonal deception depend on the situation in which interaction occurs and the relationship between sender and receiver. 
:1. Sender and receiver cognition and behaviors vary, since deceptive communication contexts vary in access to social cues, immediacy, relationship, conversational demands and spontaneity. 
:2. In deceptive interchanges, sender and receiver cognition and behaviors vary; relationships vary in familiarity (informational and behavioral) and [[Valence (psychology)|valence]].&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

==={{anchor|Other Communication-Relevant Preinteraction Factors|Other communication-relevant preinteraction factors}}Other factors before interaction===
Individuals approach deceptive exchanges with factors such as expectancy, knowledge, goals or intentions and behaviors reflecting their communication competence. IDT posits that these factors influence the deceptive exchange.
:3. Compared with truth-tellers, deceivers engage in more strategic activity designed to manage information, behavior and image and have more nonstrategic arousal cues, negative and muted [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and non-involvement.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

==={{anchor|Effects of Preinteraction Features on Senders’ Initial Detection Apprehension and Deception Displays|Effects of preinteraction features on senders' initial detection apprehension and deception displays}}Effects on sender's deception and fear of detection===
IDT posits that factors before the interaction influence the sender's [[deception]] and fear of detection.
:4. Context moderates deception; increased interaction produces greater strategic activity (information, behavior and image management) and reduced nonstrategic activity (arousal or muted affect) over time.
:5. Initial expectations of honesty are related to the degree of interactivity and the relationship between sender and receiver.
:6. Deceivers' fear of detection and associated strategic activity are inversely related to expectations of honesty, a function of context and relationship quality.
:7. Goals and motivation influence behavior.
:8. As receivers' informational, behavioral and relational familiarity increase, deceivers have a greater fear of detection and exhibit more strategic information, behavior and image management and nonstrategic leakage behavior.
:9. Skilled senders convey a truthful demeanor, with more strategic behavior and less nonstrategic leakage, better than unskilled ones.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

==={{anchor|Effects of Preinteraction Features and Initial Interaction on Receiver Cognitions|Effects of preinteraction features and initial interaction on receiver cognitions}}Effects on receiver cognition===
IDT also posits that factors before the interaction, combined with initial behavior, affect receiver suspicion and detection accuracy.
:10. Receiver judgment of sender credibility is related to receiver truth biases, context interactivity, sender encoding skills and sender deviation from expected patterns.
:11. Detection accuracy is related to receiver truth biases, context interactivity, sender encoding skills, informational and behavioral familiarity, receiver decoding skills and sender deviation from expected patterns.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

==={{anchor|Iterative Interactional Patterns|Iterative interactional patterns}}Interaction patterns===
IDT describes receiver suspicion and sender reaction.
:12. Receiver suspicion is displayed in a combination of strategic and nonstrategic behavior.
:13. Senders perceive suspicion.
:14. Suspicion, perceived or actual, increases senders' strategic and nonstrategic behavior.
:15. Deception and suspicion displays change over time.
:16. Reciprocity is the predominant interaction pattern between senders and receivers during interpersonal deception.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

==={{anchor|Postinteraction Outcomes|Postinteraction outcomes}}Outcomes===

IDT posits that interaction between sender and receiver influences how credible the receiver thinks the sender is and how suspicious the sender thinks the receiver is.
:17. Receiver detection accuracy, bias, and judgments of sender credibility after an interaction are functions of receiver cognition (suspicion and truth bias), receiver decoding skill and final sender behavior.
:18. Sender perceived deception success is a function of final sender cognition (perceived suspicion) and receiver behavior.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Receiver's Role in IDT|Receiver's role in IDT}}Receiver's role==
Although most people believe they can spot deception, IDT posits that they cannot. A deceiver must manages his or her verbal and nonverbal cues to ensure that what they are saying appears true. According to IDT, the more [[Social intelligence|socially aware]] a receiver is, the better he or she is at detecting deceit.

In a common social agreement, people are honest with one another and believe that others will be honest with them. If a deceiver begins a deceptive exchange with an accurate statement, the statement may induce the receiver to believe the rest of the deceiver's story is also true. The sender prepares the receiver to accept his or her information as truth, even if some (or all) of the dialogue is false. If the sender repeats the same tactic, the receiver will become more aware that the sender is lying.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Emotion in IDT}}Emotion==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:20160425153327-emotions-mosaic-different-expressions-faces-angry-mad-sad-smile-feelings.jpg|thumb]] --&gt;
Emotion plays a central role in IDT as a motivation and result of deception. Emotion can motivate deception, with the sender relying on relevant knowledge (informational, relational and behavioral familiarity)&lt;ref&gt;Buller &amp; Burgoon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve goals such as self-gratification, avoiding a negative emotional outcome or creating a negative emotional outcome for the target of deception. Emotion can be a result of deception, since a physical response occurs in the sender (usually arousal and negative affect).&lt;ref&gt;Ekman &amp; Friensen, 1969; Zuckerman, DePaulo et al., 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leakage===
Leakage in deception is manifested most overtly in nonverbal signals; studies indicate that over 90 percent of emotional meaning is communicated non-verbally. Humans are sensitive to body signals, and communication is often ambiguous; something is communicated verbally and its opposite non-verbally. Leakage occurs when nonverbal signals betray the true content of a contradictory verbal message. Facial expression is difficult to read, and the [[Facial Action Coding System]] (FACS) is a means of uncovering deception. Small facial movements, known as micro-expressions, can be detected in this system using action units.

==={{anchor|Micro-expressions and Action Units}}Micro-expressions and action units===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Micro expressions.png|thumb]] --&gt;
Action units (AUs) can be examined frame by frame, since these micro-expressions are often rapid. [[Paul Ekman]]’s research in facial deception has found several constants in certain expressions, with the action units relating to lip-corner pulling (AU12) and cheek-raising (AU6) qualifiers for happiness in most people. Brow-lowering (AU4) and lip-stretching (AU20) are disqualifiers for happiness. Emotional leakage appears in these fleeting expressions.

A study of Ekman’s observations revealed that AUs appear in over 90 percent of facial expressions. Despite the progress of the facial deception theory and the use of video to capture micro-expressions, it is more practical to search the body for signs of betraying what the sender is trying to communicate. The following signs may indicate deception: 
*Increased, rapid, or strained blinking
*Dilation of the pupils
*Pitch change in voice
*Increased tempo or rate of speech
*Hesitations more pronounced
*Nonverbal and verbal inconsistencies
*Sweating

University of Virginia social psychologist [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/bella-depaulo-phd Bella DePaulo] has said, "Facial cues&amp;nbsp;... are indeed faking cues".{{cn|date=July 2015}}

====Facial expression{{anchor|Facial Expression}}====
Seven basic emotions are communicated through facial expression: [[anger]], [[fear]], [[sadness]], [[joy]], [[disgust]], [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]] and [[contempt]]. These emotions are recognized universally. These expressions are innate of develop through [[socialization]].

Cultures have a variety of rules governing the social use of facial expression; for example, the Japanese discourage the display of negative emotions. Individuals may find it difficult to control facial expression, and the face may "leak" information about how they feel.

====Gaze====
{{Main|Eye contact}}
People use eye contact to indicate threat, intimacy and interest. Eye contact is used to regulate [[turn-taking]] in conversation, and indicates how interested the listener (receiver) is in what the speaker is saying. Receivers make eye contact about 70–75 percent of the time, with each contact averaging 7.8&amp;nbsp;seconds.

====Gesture====
[[Gestures]] are among the most culture-specific forms of nonverbal communication, and may lead to misinterpretation. Involuntary self-touching, such as touching the face, scratching, gripping the hands together or putting the hands in (or near) the mouth, occur when people experience intense emotions such as depression&lt;ref&gt;https://psychcentral.com/disorders/depression/&lt;/ref&gt;, elation or extreme anxiety.

Ekman and Friesen demonstrated gesture leakage by showing films of a depressed woman to a group, which was asked to judge the woman's mood. Those shown only the woman's face thought she was happy and cheerful, while the group who saw only her body thought she was tense and disturbed.

====Touch====
Touch can reassure and indicate understanding. Humans touch one another in sexual intimacy, affiliation and understanding; in greetings and farewells; as an act of aggression, and to demonstrate dominance. According to Argyle (1996), there "appear to be definite rules which permit certain kinds of touch, between certain people, on certain occasions only. Bodily contact outside these narrow limits is unacceptable".

=={{anchor|Criticism of IDT}}Criticism==
DePaulo, Ansfield and Bell questioned IDT: "We can find the 'why' question in Buller and Burgoon's synthesis. There is no intriguing riddle or puzzle that needs to be solved, and no central explanatory mechanism is ever described."&lt;ref&gt;DePaulo et al., 1996, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Although they praised Buller and Burgoon's 18 propositions as a comprehensive description of the timeline of deceptive interactions, they said the propositions lacked the interconnectedness and predictive power of a unifying theory. DePaulo ''et al.'' criticized IDT for failing to distinguish between interactive communication (which emphasizes the situational and contextual aspects of communicative exchanges) from interpersonal communication, which emphasizes exchanges in which the sender and receiver make psychological predictions about the other's behavior based on specific prior knowledge; this conceptual ambiguity limited IDT's explanatory power.&lt;ref&gt;DePaulo et al., 1996; see also Stiff, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==David Buller and Judee Burgoon==
Buller and Burgoon have conducted over two dozen experiments in which they ask participants to deceive another person, and the researchers have found that people often find themselves in situations where they make statements that are not completely honest "to avoid hurting or offending another person, to emphasize their best qualities, to avoid getting into a conflict, or to speed up or slow down a relationship".&lt;ref name="afirstlook.com"&gt;http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/interpersdecep.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Experiments}}Experiment==
Buller and Burgoon asked participants to put themselves in the following situation:
"You've been dating Pat for nearly three years and feel quite close in your relationship. Since Pat goes to a different school upstate, the two of you have agreed to date other people. Nevertheless, Pat is quite jealous and possessive. During the school year you see Pat only occasionally, but you call each other every Sunday and talk for over an hour. On Friday one of your friends invites you to a party on Saturday night, but the party is 'couples only' so you need a date. There's no way that Pat could come down for the weekend. You decide to ask someone from your class who you've been attracted to so that you can go to the party. The two of you go and have a great time. On Sunday afternoon, there's a knock on your door and it's Pat. Pat walks in and says, 'Decided to come down and surprise you, tried calling you all last night, but you weren't around. What were you doing?{{'"}} The researchers listed three possible responses: lying ("I was at the library getting ready for my theory exam"), telling part of the truth while omitting important details ("Went to a party at a friend's apartment") or being intentionally vague or evasive ("Went out for a while").&lt;ref name="afirstlook.com"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Interpersonal Deception and Online Dating}}Online dating==
A [[Qualitative research|qualitative study]] investigated deception in online dating. The study focused on four questions: (1) About what characteristics are online daters deceptive? (2) What motivation do online daters have for their deception of others in the online-dating environment? (3) What perceptions do online daters have about other daters' deceit towards them in the online-dating environment? (4) How does deception affect romantic relationships formed in the online-dating environment? In an online survey, data was collected from 15 open-ended questions. The study had 52 participants, ranging in age from 21 to 37, and found that most online daters consider themselves (and others) mostly honest in their online self-presentation. Online daters who used deception were motivated to do so by the desire to attract partners and project a positive self-image. Daters were willing to overlook deception in others if they viewed the dishonesty as a slight exaggeration or a characteristic of little value to the dater. Despite deception, participants believe that the online-dating environment can develop successful romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Wagner|first=Lyndsey|type=Master's thesis|title=Interpersonal Relationships and Online Dating|url=http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/masters/210/|publisher=[[Liberty University]]|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land recycling''' is the reuse of abandoned, vacant, or underused properties for [[redevelopment]] or repurposing.

Land recycling aims to ensure the reuse of [[developed land]] as part of: new developments; [[decontamination|cleaning up]] contaminated properties; reuse and/or making use of used land surrounded by development or nearby infrastructure. End-uses from land recycling may include: mixed-use, residential, commercial, or industrial developments; and/or [[Public space|public open space]] such as [[urban open space]] use by [[urban park]]s, [[community garden]]s; or larger [[open space reserve]]s such as [[regional park]]s.

Since many abandoned and underutilized properties lie within economically distressed and disadvantaged communities, land recycling often benefits and stimulates re-investment in historically under-served areas. The real or perceived presence of [[xenobiotic]] [[hazardous substance]]s from historical previous uses or ''in situ'' [[land pollution]], causing [[soil contamination]] and [[groundwater pollution]], may complicate the redevelopment of such properties. Such environmentally distressed properties, with site cleanup and mitigation considerations, are commonly referred to as [[brownfield]]s.

==Synonyms==
Other commonly used terms can relate to or serve as synonyms of land recycling:

* '''[[Infill|Infill development]]''': development that takes place within existing communities, making maximum use of the existing [[infrastructure]] instead of building on previously undeveloped land; 
* '''[[Sustainable development]]''': Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs; and
* '''[[Brownfield land|Brownfield development]]''': development of [[real property]] for which its reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a [[dangerous goods|hazardous substance]], pollutant or contaminant.

==Benefits==

The US Government [[Accountability Office]] estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfields and almost {{convert|15|e6acre|km2}} of potentially contaminated properties across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Brownfield Redevelopment: Stakeholders Report That EPA's Program Helps to Redevelop Sites, but Additional Measures Could Complement Agency Efforts
GAO-05-94; December 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; These sites sit idle and neglected, serving as desolate eyesores within their communities. By putting these barren infill sites to use, land recycling revitalizes communities, promotes [[sustainable development]], and preserves precious [[land resource|resources]]. The social, economic, environmental, and other benefits of land recycling include:

* Social and economic [[revitalization]]
* Sustainability
* An alternative to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]
* Direction of [[economic development|development]] to urban cores
* Addressing [[climate change]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Social and economic revitalization===

Land recycling helps clean up and revitalize inner cities by returning abandoned, idle, or underused sites to productive use, bolstering [[community spirit]], creating jobs and boosting local tax-revenues.

The re-use of land revitalizes communities and renews economic activity, particularly in under-served urban areas. Abandoned, idled, and vacant properties often lie in former industrial and commercial areas, typically in urban and historically disadvantaged areas. These sites can be community eyesores, negatively impacting social and economic development, and often human and [[environmental health]]. The failure to redevelop brownfields in particular translates into potentially more exposure to toxics and the loss of economic and housing benefits that can come from appropriate redevelopment.

By putting these properties to new and productive use, land recycling encourages growth of [[business]]es and services in such areas, helping to break up concentrations of [[poverty]], creating jobs, and stimulating additional private investment and local tax-revenue. An abandoned, well-situated, factory site can be cleaned up and redeveloped into a much-needed mixed-use development with a grocery store, senior housing, and access to public transportation. The addition of neighborhood-serving retail, affordable housing, or a clean public park in a disadvantaged community can boost local spirit and improve overall quality of life.

===Sustainability===
[[Sustainability]] involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Land recycling expresses an inherently sustainable idea, based on the same common-sense as recycling an aluminum can. Like other natural resources, land represents a shared investment that should be reused and recycled, rather than [[land consumption|consumed]] and abandoned after use. [[Recycling paper]] saves trees, reusing land saves land.

By encouraging the recycling rather than the consumption of land, land recycling promotes [[smart growth]] and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, {{convert|4.5|acre|m2}} of undeveloped land is conserved.
[http://www.gwu.edu/~eem/Brownfields/project_report/chapters-html.htm#chapter5 Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials]. As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption. Each infill development prevents sprawl into open space, forests and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.

===An alternative to sprawl===
Land recycling increases density in urban areas, by reducing [[urban sprawl]] and unplanned, low-density, [[automobile]]-dependent developments.

Sprawl development scatters housing, public transit, jobs and other amenities farther apart, demanding more frequent use of cars for travel. The increase in vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) produces a range of health and environmental problems, including air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased incidence of traffic jams and asthma. This results in a lower quality of life for residents, ever-increasing commute times, and the health implications of smog.

By moving new jobs, economic opportunities and community amenities farther from established populations, sprawl development can cripple once-thriving cities. This trend takes a toll on the socio-economic health of urban communities as growth retreats from the urban center.

Rather than take advantage of existing infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and public works, building sprawl projects abandons these resources and demands further consumption of land and resources.

Land recycling offers an intelligent alternative to sprawl development. It reuses vital infrastructure and public resources and creates compact, full-service neighborhoods that reduce [[vehicle use]] and [[carbon dependence]]. Rebuilding in urban neighborhoods generates reinvestment in vibrant economic and cultural centers, rather than drawing away much-needed resources. Compact, urban development through land recycling is essential to sustainable development and is key to managing rapid population growth across the United States and beyond. As daily commute times decrease, the general quality of life improves as residents have more time to enjoy the world around them.

===Directing development to urban cores===
Redirecting population growth and growth of businesses to already urbanized areas is integral to fostering sustainable communities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Applying sustainable principles to land use and growth management requires that growth be redirected from scattered fringe areas back to our urban cores, where people, services and infrastructure already exist. Building up our urban areas positively increases population density, providing the critical mass to support local services from coffee shops to grocery stores, public transit to libraries and symphony halls. Land recycling provides opportunities for urban renewal and to build truly livable communities: efficient, compact, vibrant urban neighborhoods integrated with public transit systems, which offer a mix of uses as well as affordable housing.

===Addressing climate change===
Land recycling effectively curbs [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] emissions by encouraging smart, compact growth that reduces [[vehicle dependence]]. Redevelopment within an urban core reduces commuting distances and therefore average vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by creating residential, office, and other amenities within close proximity. Since transportation alone accounts for a third of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the United States, land recycling offers a key tool in any fight against climate change.  A recent Urban Land Institute study found that compact urban developments reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by 20 to 40 percent &lt;ref&gt;Urban Land Institute.  Growing Cooler: The Evidence of Urban Development and Climate Change.  Available at  {{cite web|url=http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; because users are closer to amenities and can more easily rely on public transportation. Smart urban planning is therefore crucial to maximizing energy savings and overall reduction of greenhouse gases.

{{As of | 2009}} the green movement has started to emphasize the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System, a certification system that rewards the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. LEED certification signifies incorporation of smart building design and technology to reduce energy use and minimize waste. However, even if a building is energy-efficient, the energy required to travel to and from a LEED certified site may well exceed the energy saved through energy-efficient features. LEED certified buildings and other developments best benefit climate change when they reuse infill sites and access existing resources.

==Challenges==
While land recycling has great economic and environmental benefits, without the right tools, skills, and knowledge, reusing land can produce certain challenges.  Obstacles to redevelopment may include lack of funding and increased scrutiny. These can particularly impede projects on brownfields, which carry the stigma of contamination. Because of these concerns, the perceived ease of developing on open land, or [[greenfield land|greenfields]], remains alluring to many. Factors that hinder land recycling include:

* market factors
* environmental-liability risks
* uncertainty and cost
* complicated/confusing regulatory requirements
* difficulty in obtaining project financing
* the lure of greenfields

===Market factors===
As the saying goes, in [[real estate]] only three things matter: location, location, location. Because idled and underused infill sites are often located in distressed urban areas concerns arise about crime, safety, and access to quality education and services. These and other market factors frequently pull development to open land near traditionally desirable communities and away from urban infill sites.

====Greenfields competition====
Brownfields and infill sites must compete with attractive, undeveloped suburban and rural land, also called [[greenfield land]]. When considering the real or perceived risks and costs of land recycling, a greenfield development may seem more economically sensible as the immediate costs are typically less than developing on an infill or brownfield site. However, it is important to consider the long-term economic gain of land recycling and the added social and environmental rewards of sustainable development.

===Brownfields===
As defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, a [[brownfield]] site is “real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant”. In other words, brownfield sites comprise abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.

====Uncertainty and costs====
Assessing whether or not a site is contaminated can be a costly process that deters land reuse. Potential purchasers are often unwilling or unable to risk an investment in a site assessment for a property that may require cleanup they cannot afford. Even if a site has been purchased, concerns over cleanup costs may further stall redevelopment. Uncertainty over time, cost or a high price for cleanup leaves many brownfield sites in development limbo.

====Project financing====
Obtaining private front-end financing for brownfield cleanup can be a difficult process{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Since financing is more readably available for development on greenfields, infill and brownfield sites are often passed over.

===Environmental-liability risks===
Although recent changes in some country's federal laws provide some liability relief to new purchasers of contaminated properties, the law remains very complex and many state laws still have strict liability covering real property. Thus, in many cases, any current or past property owner can potentially be legally and financially liable regardless of who is responsible for contamination. This liability web continues to throw a chill on many brownfield projects even in the presence of regulatory reforms designed to encourage redevelopment. A common belief among many brownfield owners is that it is less risky and cheaper to abandon or “mothball” a facility than to conduct a site assessment that could trigger large cleanup costs and potential liability.

====Regulatory requirements====
The potentially complex process of successfully redeveloping an infill site, particularly a brownfield, can challenge land recycling interest and proposals.  Understanding and complying with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements can be daunting for some property owners and developers. Guidance from legal specialists and environmental cleanup consultants is often needed to design, develop, and guide a project through the process of regulatory requirements and permitting approvals.

'''Lawrence University''' is a liberal arts college and conservatory of music in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], United States. Founded in 1847, the school held its first classes on November 12, 1849. Lawrence was the second college in the United States to be founded as a [[coeducational]] institution. 

In a study by the [[National Science Foundation]], Lawrence ranked 28th nationally in the percentage of graduates who go on to earn doctorates in science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf13323/|title=National Science Foundation, Baccalaureate Origins of U.S.-trained S&amp;E Doctorate Recipients}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence is consistently ranked in the top tier of national liberal arts colleges by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/lawrence-university-3856| title =Lawrence University; US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==
The {{convert|84|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} campus is located in downtown Appleton, divided into two parts by the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]]. The academic campus is on the north shore of the river, and the major athletic facilities (including the 5000-seat Banta Bowl) are on the southeast shore. Lawrence also has a {{convert|425|acre|ha|sing=on}} northern estate called [[Björklunden]] (full name: Björklunden vid sjön), which serves as a site for retreats, seminars, concerts, and theatrical performances.  It contains a chapel for weddings.  Donald and Winifred Boynton of [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]], [[Illinois]], donated the property in [[Door County, Wisconsin|Door County]] to Lawrence in 1963.

===Campus development===
In the mid-1980s, the Physics Department built a $330,000 small laser laboratory (known as the "laser palace"), which includes 800 5&amp;nbsp;mW small lasers and more than 500 mirrors.

In 2009, Lawrence opened the Richard and Margot Warch Campus Center, a gathering place for students, faculty, staff, alumni, and guests from the Fox Cities community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrence.edu/s/warch_campus_center/about |title=About the Campus Center |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 107,000 square foot building is situated on the Fox River on the site of the former Hulburt House. The Warch Campus Center includes a cinema, campus dining services, campus mailboxes, and various meeting and event spaces. The building has earned a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold certification for meeting sustainability goals in energy conservation, environmental friendliness, and green building.

The college has a long history of razing buildings on its campus, because of the limited land available for constructing new buildings. Many buildings on campus are built on the site of former buildings. Some razed buildings include:
* Peabody Hall of Music (20th century)
* Hamar Union (1960)
* Underwood Observatory (1962)
* Alexander Gym I (1962)
* Carnegie Library (1964)
* Worcester Art Center (1987)
* Stephenson Hall of Science (1998)
* Hulbert House (2006) (new construction: Warch Campus Center, 2009)

==History==
Lawrence's first president, William Harkness Sampson, founded the school with [[Henry R. Colman]], using $10,000 provided by [[philanthropist]] [[Amos Adams Lawrence]], and matched by the [[Methodist]] church. Both founders were ordained Methodist [[minister of religion|ministers]], but Lawrence was [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]]. The school was originally named '''Lawrence Institute of Wisconsin''' in its 1847 charter from the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature, but the name was changed to Lawrence University before classes began in November 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrence.edu/library/archives/history.shtml |title=Lawrence History &amp;#124; Lawrence University |publisher=Lawrence.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also  Charles Breunig’s book, A Great and Good Work: A History of Lawrence University, 1847-1964.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its oldest extant building, [[Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall]], was built in 1853.&lt;ref name=hcap&gt;Council of Independent Colleges, "[http://hcap.artstor.org/cgi-bin/library?a=d&amp;d=p976 Main Hall]", Historic Campus Architecture Project.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence University was the second coeducational institution in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawrence.edu/admissions/about/president |title=President Mark Burstein |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Lawrence University |publisher=Lawrence University |access-date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence's first period of major growth came during the tenure of [[alumnus]] [[Samuel G. Plantz]] as president. From 1894 to 1924, when Plantz presided over the school, its student body grew from 200 to 800.

From 1913 until 1964, the school was named '''Lawrence College''', to emphasize its small size and [[liberal arts]] education focus. The name was changed to Lawrence University when it merged with [[Milwaukee-Downer College]]. The state of Wisconsin then purchased the Milwaukee-Downer property and buildings to expand the campus of the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]. Initially, the university designated two entities: Lawrence College for Men and Downer College for Women. This separation has not lasted in any material form, though degrees are still conferred "on the recommendation of the Faculty of Lawrence and Downer Colleges" and the university by-laws still make the distinction.

During [[World War II]], Lawrence College was one of 131 colleges and universities in the nation that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name="lawrence-v-12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myhistorymuseum.org/WWII/1943/lawrence.htm |title=Call to Duty, Lawrence University's V-12 Program |publisher=Outagamie County Historical Society (OCHS) |last= |first= |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |year=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208022740/http://www.myhistorymuseum.org/WWII/1943/lawrence.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lawrence Conservatory of Music, usually referred to as "the Con", was founded in 1874.  Lawrence offers two degrees: a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and a [[Bachelor of Music]]. It also offers a five-year dual degree program, where students can receive both B.A. and B.Mus. degrees. 

Freshman Studies at Lawrence is a mandatory two-term class, in which all students study the same selected 11 classic works of literature, art, and music. President [[Nathan M. Pusey]] is credited with initiating the program in 1945, although Professor Waples chaired the Freshman Studies Committee and was responsible for implementing the program. The program continues to this day, despite being temporarily suspended in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freshman Studies History|url=http://www.lawrence.edu/academics/study/freshman_studies/history|website=Lawrence University|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Lawrence University initiated a capital campaign called "More Light!", which aimed at raising $150 million. By October 2011 the college had raised $160,272,839, with the conclusion event held on October 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lawrence.edu/mlfinale/2011/10/photos-from-the-more-light-finale-celebration.html |title=Photos From the More Light! Finale Celebration « More Light Finale |publisher=Blogs.lawrence.edu |date=2011-10-29 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence University is part of the [[Oberlin Group]], a consortium of liberal arts college libraries.

===Milwaukee-Downer traditions===
[[File:Lawrence University.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The cupola on [[Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall]] at Lawrence University is an Appleton landmark.]]
The [[traditions]] and heritage of Milwaukee-Downer are woven into the Appleton campus, from the grove of [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] trees (called Hawthornden) between Brokaw and Colman halls, to the [[sundial]] on the back of [[Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall]], to the bestowing upon each class a class color and banner.

The Lawrence Dean of Women was referred to as the "Dean of Downer", but when the offices of Dean of Men and Dean of Women were merged to form the Dean of Students, the substantive duties of the "Dean of Downer" came to an end; the title is still borne by a senior female professor, but her only duty is to carry the Downer Mace in academic processions. For many years the women's choir was called the Downer Chorus.  At one time the BA was conferred upon women in the name of "Downer College of Lawrence University" and upon men in the name of "Lawrence College of Lawrence University"; now all B.A. degrees are conferred in the name of "Lawrence &amp; Downer Colleges of Lawrence University." (The B.Mus. degree is from "the Lawrence University Conservatory of Music.)

==Academics==
[[File:muddlib.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Seeley G. Mudd Library. The library contains over 420,000 volumes.]]
Lawrence University operates on a [[Academic term|trimester]] calendar. The academic year runs from mid-September to mid-June. The student/faculty ratio at Lawrence is 9:1.&lt;ref name="lawrence1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawrence.edu/admissions/about/international/ |title=International Resources - Lawrence University |publisher=Lawrence.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511013306/http://lawrence.edu/admissions/about/international/ |archive-date=2012-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence grants Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Music degrees, with a [[double degree]] possible. Lawrence offers a number of cooperative degree programs in areas such as [[engineering]], [[health sciences]] and [[environmental studies]].

The college offers majors in most of the [[liberal arts]]. The school also offers the option of [[interdisciplinary]] areas of study and allows students to design their own majors.  All students are required to take Freshman Studies, which introduces students to broad areas of study and provides a common academic experience for the college. Lawrence's freshman studies program focuses on a mixture of Great Books and more contemporary, influential works. The 2013–2014 list included Plato's ''Republic'' and Alison Bechdel's ''Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic''.

The school has an independent study option that allows students to design their own courses. This allows students to explore academic interests not covered by Lawrence’s classes or to explore topics more deeply. Over 90% of the students take advantage of the independent study program.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Conservatory of Music===
The [[Lawrence University Conservatory of Music]] was founded in 1874 and has been a part of Lawrence University ever since. The Conservatory offers Bachelor of Music degrees in Performance, Theory/Composition, Music Education, and a five-year double degree option that grants both a BM degree from the Conservatory and a BA degree from the College.  Approximately 25% of the Lawrence student body, or 350 students, is in the Conservatory. The Conservatory has three choirs, two bands, two jazz ensembles, a symphony orchestra, an improvisation collective, five world music ensembles, and numerous chamber music groups.

==Student body==
[[File:Hietthall.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hiett Hall, a dormitory]]
Lawrence enrolls about 1,500 students who hail from nearly every U.S. state. The total enrollment in academic year 2010-2011 was 1,566 students,&lt;ref name=2010profile&gt;As of Fall 2010. {{cite web | title = 2010 Profile | publisher = Lawrence University | url = http://lawrence.edu/about/lu_factsheet.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120511014100/http://lawrence.edu/about/lu_factsheet.pdf | archivedate = May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest student body in Lawrence University's history. Over 75% of the students identify as white.&lt;ref name=2010profile/&gt;  About 12% are [[international student]]s.&lt;ref name="lawrence1"/&gt; About 25% of students study in the conservatory of music.  In the fall of 2014, a quarter of the incoming class were domestic students of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hail to the Class of 2018: Lawrence Welcomes More than 400 New Students|url=https://blogs.lawrence.edu/news/2014/09/hail-to-the-class-of-2018-lawrence-welcomes-more-than-400-new-students.html|date=2014-09-09|accessdate=2014-12-02|work= Lawrence University News Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student traditions==
At the beginning of every academic year in September, incoming freshmen arrive a week before returning students to partake in Welcome Week. During Welcome Week, various activities are planned in order to help the incoming class get to know one another and to help them acclimate to college life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome Week 2016 Schedule|url=https://www.lawrence.edu/mw/DS16-111%20WW%20Schedule-Domestic%20Students_1.pdf|website=Lawrence University|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first night of Welcome Week, students and their parents attend the President's Welcome, which concludes with the traditional matriculation handshake, where every member of the incoming class shakes hands and exchanges words with the university's president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome Week 2016 Schedule|url=https://www.lawrence.edu/mw/DS16-111%20WW%20Schedule-Domestic%20Students_1.pdf|website=Lawrence University|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the fall term, the on-campus fraternity [[Beta Theta Pi]] hosts the annual Beach Bash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lawrentian.com/archives/104359 |last1=Denault|first1=Ethan|title=Y’all gonna make me act a fool|website=The Lawrentian|publisher=The Lawrentian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324213703/http://www.lawrentian.com/archives/104359 |archivedate=24 March 2016 |accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this event, the brothers of Beta Theta Pi shovel approximately 14 tons of sand into the fraternity house basement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birch|first1=Hannah|title=Senator Tim Kaine campaigns on campus, pushes early voting|url=http://www.lawrentian.com/archives/1009298|website=The Lawrentian|publisher=The Lawrentian|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and install a boardwalk and a lifeguard station that doubles as a DJ booth.

During Spring Term, Lawrence University hosts a music festival, LU-aroo (a play on words on the popular music festival [[Bonnaroo]]). Held on the quad, the festival features many talented student bands, both from the college and the conservatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Senye|first1=Yame|title=LUAROO|url=http://blogs.lawrence.edu/admissions-studentstories/2014/05/luaroo.html|website=Lawrence University Student Stories|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the musician [[The Tallest Man on Earth]] played at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyman|first1=Shane|title=LU to host Tallest Man on Earth|url=http://www.postcrescent.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/04/05/lu-host-tallest-man-earth/82656062/|website=The Post-Crescent|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the university's Spring Term, many seniors participate in the Senior Streak, which typically happens during the eighth week of the term.&lt;ref name="The Lawrentian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Staff Editorial: Senior streak re-revisited|url=http://www.lawrentian.com/archives/108681|website=The Lawrentian|publisher=The Lawrentian|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the senior streak is to provide seniors with one last opportunity to let loose before finals, graduation, and post-college life.&lt;ref name="The Lawrentian"/&gt; Although rumor says that the senior streak was created as a result of former president [[Richard Warch]]'s aversion to the activity, this has been proven to be false.&lt;ref name="The Lawrentian"/&gt; Students, often coming from Lawrence's on-campus bar, the Viking Room, strip their clothes and run around the area of Main Hall, as one last hurrah before finals and graduation.

==Media==
The student newspaper, ''[[The Lawrentian]]'', has been published for over a century. 

Lawrence University hosts the [[Great Midwest Trivia Contest]], webcast every January over the college radio station, [[WLFM]].

In 2011 Lawrence's men's cross country team won the Midwest Conference championships for the first time since 1985, beating [[Grinnell College]] and ending its 14-year winning streak.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8781">Obstetric complications are those complications that develop during pregnancy. A woman may develop an infection, syndrome or complication that is not unique to pregnancy and that may have existed before pregnancy. Pregnancy often is complicated by preexisting and concurrent conditions. Though these pre-existing and concurrent conditions may have great impact on pregnancy, they are not included in the following list.

==History==
For as long as there have been words and pictures, the people of the world have been consuming media. Improved [[technology]] such as the [[printing press]] has fed increased consumption. Around 1600 the [[camera obscura]] was perfected. Light was inverted through a small hole or lens from outside, and projected onto a surface or screen, creating a moving image. This new medium had a very small effect on society compared to the old ones. The [[History of photography|development of photography]] in the middle 19th century made those images permanent, greatly reducing the cost of pictures. By the end of the century millions of consumers were seeing new, professionally-made photographs every day.

In the 1860s mechanisms such as the [[zoetrope]], [[mutoscope]] and [[praxinoscope]] that produced two-dimensional drawings in motion were created. They were displayed in public halls for people to observe.&lt;ref name="Wright &amp; Pritchard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=A. |last2=Pritchard |first2=M. E. |title=An examination of the relation of gender, mass media influence, and loneliness to disordered eating among college students |journal=Eating and Weight Disorders – Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity |year=2009 |volume=14 |issue=2–3 |pages=e144–e147 |doi=10.1007/BF03327813}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[new media]] foreshadowed the [[mass media]] consumption of later years.

Around the 1880s, the development of the [[motion picture camera]] allowed individual component images to be captured and stored on a single reel. Motion pictures were projected onto a screen to be viewed by an audience. This moving camera affected the progression of the world immensely, beginning the [[American film industry]] as well as early international movements such as [[German Expressionism]], [[Surrealism]] and the [[Soviet Montage]]. For the first time people could tell stories on film, and distribute their works to consumers worldwide.

In the 1920s electronic [[History of television|television was working]] in laboratories,&lt;ref name="Berg, Patricia 2007" /&gt; and in the 1930s hundreds of receivers were in use worldwide. By 1941 the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS) was broadcasting two 15-minute newscasts a day to a tiny audience on its New York television station. However, the television industry did not begin to boom until the general [[post–World War II economic expansion]].&lt;ref name="Hobza et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hobza |first1=C. L. |last2=Walker |first2=K. E. |last3=Yakushko |first3=O. |last4=Peugh |first4=J. L. |year=2007 |title=What about men?

Computers were developed in the middle 20th century, and commercialized in the 1960s. Apple and other companies sold computers for hobbyists in the 1970s, and in 1981 [[IBM]] released computers intended for consumers.

On August 6, 1991 the [[internet]] and [[World Wide Web]], long in use by computer specialists, became available to the public. This was the start of the commercialized Internet that people use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andreassen |first=C. S. |title=Online Social Network Site Addiction: A Comprehensive Review |journal=Current Addiction Reports |year=2015 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=175–184 |doi=10.1007/s40429-015-0056-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Friends Reunited]], the first [[social media]] site, was released to the public. Since then, [[Myspace]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and other social networks have been created. Facebook and Twitter are the top social media sites in terms of usage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Amanda L. |last1=Forest |first2=Joanne V. |last2=Wood |title=When Social Networking Is Not Working: Individuals With Low Self-Esteem Recognize but Do Not Reap the Benefits of Self-Disclosure on Facebook |journal=Psychological Science |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=295–302 |doi=10.1177/0956797611429709}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Facebook has a total of 1,230,000,000 consumers while Twitter has 645,750,000. Both companies are worth billions of dollars, and continue to grow.&lt;ref name="L. Burrow, Anthony 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burrow |first1=Anthony L. |last2=Rainone |first2=Nicolette |year=2017 |title=How many ''likes'' did I get?: Purpose moderates links between positive social media feedback and self-esteem |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=69 |pages=232–236 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2016.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall media consumption has immensely increased over time, from the era of the introduction of motion pictures, to the age of social networks and the internet.

==People involved==

Media is the sum of information and entertainment media taken in by an individual or group. The first source of media was solely word of mouth. When written language was established, scrolls were passed, but mass communication was never an option. It wasn't until the printing press that media could be consumed on a high level. Johannes Gutenberg, a goldsmith and businessman from the mining town of Mainz in southern Germany printing press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=Johannes Gutenberg and the Printing Press|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/gstartinventors/a/Gutenberg.htm|publisher=Inventors.About}}&lt;/ref&gt; His technology allowed books, newspapers, and flyers to be printed and distributed on a mass level.

The first newspaper written on paper was done by Benjamin Harris in the British-American Colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ringer|first=Wesley|title=History of the Bible: How The Bible Came To Us|url=http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/bibleorigin.html|publisher=godandscience|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of a newspaper was one of the most influential pieces in media consumption history, because it pertained to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benjamin Harris|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/255892/Benjamin-Harris|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually communication reached an electronic state, and the telegraph was invented. Harrison Dyar, who sent electrical sparks through chemically treated paper tape to burn dots and dashes, invented the first telegraph in the USA.&lt;ref name="Bellis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=The History of the Electric Telegraph and Telegraphy|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/tstartinventions/a/telegraph.htm|publisher=inventors.about}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telegraph was the first piece of equipment that allowed users to send electronic messages. A more developed version came from Samuel Morse, whose telegraph printed code on tape and was operated using a keypad and an earpiece.&lt;ref name="Bellis"/&gt; The pattern of communication soon became known as Morse code.

Inventors Elisha Gray and Alexander Graham Bell both independently designed the telephone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=The History of the Telephone – Alexander Graham Bell|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventors/a/telephone.htm|publisher=inventors.about|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telephone was simple enough for everyone to use and didn't require learning a code.

Soon after the telephone came the radio. Combining technology from both the telegraph and telephone, Guglielmo Marconi sent and received his first radio signal in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=The Invention of Radio|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/rstartinventions/a/radio.htm|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally in 1947, after a long period of development, television exploded as a medium. Not one person is responsible for the creation of the television, but Marvin Middlemark invented "rabbit ears" in 1930, which allowed for televisions to be a commercial product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=Television history|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/tstartinventions/a/Television.htm|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television has by far been the most influential consumed media, and allowed news to spread on a visual level.

In 1976, Apple created the first consumer computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Computers|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/blcoindex.htm|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The computer was the start of mass written communication using email. Apple continues to be a leading company in computer use.

In 1998, the first ever social media site [[SixDegrees.com]] was created by [[Andrew Weinreich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/NewMedia/SocialMedia/SocialMediaHistory.html|title=The Brief History of Social Media|date=2012-03-16|access-date=2017-10-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316122748/http://www.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/NewMedia/SocialMedia/SocialMediaHistory.html|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It enabled users to upload a profile and make friends with other users. Shortly later in 1999, [[Friends Reunited]] was created by Steve and Julie Pankhurst and friend Jason Porter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/advice/12114738/Steve-Pankhurst-Friends-Reunited-millionaire-Geeky-techies-are-the-new-celebrities.html|title=Steve Pankhurst, Friends Reunited millionaire: 'Geeky techies are the new celebrities'|last=Stanford|first=Peter|date=2016|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sites like MySpace created by [[Tom Anderson]] gained prominence in the early 2000s. By 2006, Facebook created by [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and Twitter created by [[Jack Dorsey]] both became available to users throughout the world. These sites remain some of the most popular social networks on the Internet.

==Increase==

Among other factors, a person's access to media technology affects the amount and quality of his or her intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Aeron|title=Political Communication and Social Theory|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, for instance, "U.C. San Diego scientists in 2009 estimated the 'average' American consumes 34 [[gigabyte]]s of media a day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phelps|first=Andrew|title=Ethan Zuckerman wants you to eat your (news) vegetables – or at least have better information|journal=Nieman Journalism Lab|date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of media consumption among individuals is increasing as new technologies are created. According to phys.org, a new study done by a researcher at the San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California, says that by 2015, the sum of media asked for and delivered to consumers on mobile devices and their homes would take more than 15 hours a day to see or hear,&lt;ref name="Zverin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zverin|first=Jan|title=U.S. Media Consumption to Rise to 15.5 Hours a Day – Per Person – by 2015|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/u.s._media_consumption_to_rise_to_15.5_hours_a_day_per_person_by_2015|publisher=UC San Diego New Press|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an amount equivalent to watching nine DVDs' worth of data per person per day.&lt;ref name="Zverin"/&gt;

With [[social media]] networks rapidly growing such as [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]], our world of media consumption is reaching a younger and younger age group, making our consumption that much larger as a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lunden|first=Ingrid|title=Instagram is the Fastest-Growing Social Site Globally, Mobile Devices Rule Over PCs For Access|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/21/instagram-is-the-fastest-growing-social-site-globally-mobile-devices-rule-over-pcs-for-social-access/|publisher=Tech Crunch|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Networking Fact Sheet|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/social-networking-fact-sheet/|publisher=Pew Research Internet Project|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing Media: We Need a Plan|url=http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/managing-media-we-need-a-plan.aspx|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[mobile device]]s such as [[smartphone]]s, news, entertainment, shopping and buying are all now at the tip of our fingers, anytime, anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vanac|first=Mary|title=A Whole Grocery Store at Your Fingertips|date=January 4, 2013|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive effects==
There are a number of positive effects of media consumption. Television can have positive effects on children as they are growing up. Shows like ''Sesame Street'' teach valuable lessons to children in developmental stages, such as math, the alphabet, kindness, racial equality, and cooperation.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Center for Biotechnology Information|pmc=2792691|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dora the Explorer'' introduces foreign language to children of all backgrounds in a fun, cooperative environment.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"/&gt;

[[Mass media]] has a huge grasp on today's adolescents.  Many young people use different types of social media daily.  Mass media can be used to socialize adolescents from around the world and can help to give them a fundamental understanding of [[social norm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christopher E|first=Beaudoin|year=2014|title=The Mass Media and Adolescent Socialization: A Prospective Study in the Context of Unhealthy Food Advertising|url=|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly; Columbia|volume=91|pages=544–561|via=ABI/INFORM Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media relating to advertising can also have a positive effect. Some alcohol manufacturers are known to spend at least ten percent of their budget on warnings about the dangers of drinking and driving.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"/&gt; Also, studies show that milk consumption (though controversial) shot up in children fifteen years of age and younger due to print and broadcast advertisements.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"/&gt;

Many [[video game]]s can also have positive effects. Games like [[Wii]] Tennis and Wii Fit improve hand-eye coordination as well as general mental and physical health.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2013/11/video-games.aspx|title=Video Games Play May Provide Learning, Health, Social Benefits|website=www.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games, including shooting games, with an abundance of violence, improves a child's learning, physical as well as mental health and social skills. These games that are rated for mature adults are beneficial to the development of children according to a study that was published by the American Psychological Association ([[American Psychological Association|APA]]). The study showed that there is a need to look at the positive effects as well as the negative ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Granic|first=Isabela|last2=Lobel|first2=Adam|last3=Engels|first3=Rutger C. M. E.|date=January 2014|title=The benefits of playing video games|journal=The American Psychologist|volume=69|issue=1|pages=66–78|doi=10.1037/a0034857|issn=1935-990X|pmid=24295515}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a child plays a video game, they naturally develop problem-solving skills. Strategic video games, such as role-playing games, release statistics that the more intense game play improved in problem solving skills and there is a significant rise in school grades as well, according to a study that was taken over a several year span but was published in 2013.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The study also showcased that the creativity of children was also enhanced by playing all genres of video games, including once again violent games. Research revealed that video games benefit children more than using other sources of technology.

The internet itself is a huge positive for people of all ages, as it now is a personal library for anyone who has access.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"/&gt; The number of educational websites and services offered are so immense that research has become a task much easier than it was in the past. Social media has also provided many benefits for people over time, as it has been evaluated as a pro-social way of interacting with people all over the world.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbooks Online"&gt;{{cite web|title=Children's Media Use: A Positive Psychology Approach – Oxford Handbooks|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195398809.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195398809-e-10|accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those in education, on both sides of the fence media consumption is crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://youthrelationships.org/free-lesson-plans|title=Critical Media Literacy: Free Lesson Plans|last=|first=|date=|website=Western Centre for School and Mental Health|access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instructors as well as students across all grade levels consume media for school curricula in Ontario.  Media literacy is prominent to the youth who enter an era where the media is a surrounding factor.  When a student learns to approach certain media sources with a critical lens, its understood that all forms of media have no sense of neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Converging Media: A New Introduction to Mass Communication, 5th edition|last=Pavlik, McIntosh|first=John, Shawn|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who consume media are capable of questioning the media they are consuming, that relatively improves knowledge. To broaden their understanding and knowledge, they often find it easier to question an author's purpose, the reasoning for certain images being used, the representation of content and its meaning to certain individuals, and overall the effects of the media being consumed and a personal as well as social level. Media relating to learning is a source as well as a tool. Since its start many use [[Rosetta Stone (software)]] to help guide them into learning a new language. It is a source that is compatible because it is portable and can be used in several platforms i.e. (iPad, Tablet, Phone Apps Websites).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecv.missouri.edu/Word%20and%20PDF/Issue%206/6-2.pdf|title=Rosetta Stone and Language Proficiency of International Secondary School|last=Griffin|first=Robert|last2=Martinez|first2=James|date=2014|website=|publisher=ECV: Engaging Cultures and Voices|access-date=March 24, 2017|last3=Martin|first3=Ellice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative effects==
Media consumption can have a wide range of negative behavioral and emotional effects.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Thompson 2013 155"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant, Thompson|first=Jennings, Susan|title=Fundamentals of Media Effects|year=2013|publisher=Waveland Press Inc.|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many instances of [[violence in movies]], television, video games and websites which can affect one's level of aggression. These violent depictions can desensitize viewers to acts of violence and can also provoke mimicking of the acts. Since violence is so rampant in media, viewers believe they live in a more violent world than they actually do.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Thompson 2013 155"/&gt;

The reach of media is expanding globally and with this television has become a vice around the world. Television addiction has been labeled as the plug in drug since 1977. Over the years televisions are now located in almost every home, according to most recent estimates taken by Nielsen in the U.S. alone there are 116.4&amp;nbsp;million T.V. homes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/nielsen-estimates-116-4-million-tv-homes-in-the-us-for-the-2015-16-tv-season.html|title=NIELSEN ESTIMATES 116.4 MILLION TV HOMES IN THE U.S. FOR THE 2015–16 TV SEASON|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television can have a negative impact on adolescents and cause them to behave in a manner that is not part of normal social norm. In an article about media violence on society it states that extensive TV viewing among adolescents and young adults is associated with subsequent aggressive acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/295/5564/2377.full|title=The Effects of Media Violence on Society|first1=Craig A.|last1=Anderson|first2=Brad J.|last2=Bushman|date=29 March 2002|journal=Science|volume=295|issue=5564|pages=2377–2379|doi=10.1126/science.1070765}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs that portray violent acts can change an adolescent's view on violence and this may lead them to develop aggressive behavior.  These shows usually portray a person who commits a crime or resorts to violence.  They also show that these people go unpunished for their crime, creating the notion that crime is something a person can get away with.  Studies show that 65% of people between the age of 8 to 18 have a television in their room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/107/2/423|title=Children, Adolescents, and Television|author=American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Public Education|journal=Pediatrics|year=2001|volume=107|issue=2|doi=10.1542/peds.107.2.423|pmid=11158483}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average high-schooler watches, on average,14 hours of television a week.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=May–June 2003|title=Impact of media use on children and youth|journal=Paediatr Child Health|volume=8|pages=301–306|via=|pmc=2792691|pmid=20020034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive television viewing and computer game playing has also been associated with many psychiatric symptoms, especially emotional and behavioral symptoms, somatic complaints, attention problems such as hyperactivity, and family interaction problems.&lt;ref name="pediatrics.aappublications.org"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/5/978 |first1=Markus |last1=Dworak |first2=Thomas |last2=Schierl |first3=Thomas |last3=Bruns |first4=Heiko Klaus |last4=Strüder |title=Impact of Singular Excessive Computer Game and Television Exposure on Sleep Patterns and Memory Performance of School-aged Children |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-0476 |pmid=17974734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When adolescents watch television for long periods of time they spend less time being active and engaged in physical activity. Many adolescents who spend large amounts of time watching television see actors as role models and try to emulate them by trying to be like them this can also have a negative impact on people's [[body image]]s, mostly women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After seeing beautiful and thinner than average women in the media, viewers may feel worse about themselves and sometimes develop eating disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamamiya|first=Yuko|first2=Thomas F. |last2=Cash |first3=Susan E. |last3=Melnyk |first4=Heidi D. |last4=Posavac |first5=Steven S. |last5=Posavac |title=Women's exposure to thin-and-beautiful media images: body image effects of media-ideal internalization and impact-reduction interventions|year=2005|journal=Body Image|volume=2|issue=1|pages=74–80|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2004.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the reason obesity rates have greatly increased in the last 20 years is due to increased media consumption. This is due to the fact that children are spending much more time playing video games and watching television than exercising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boero|first=Natalie|title=All the News that's Fat to Print: The American 'Obesity Epidemic' and the Media|journal=Qualitative Sociology|year=2007|volume=30|issue=1|pages=41–60|doi=10.1007/s11133-006-9010-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Social media is said to also cause anxiety and depression. Research suggests that young people who spend more than 2 hours per day on social media are more likely to report poor mental health, including psychological distress.

Numerous studies have also shown that media consumption has a significant association with poor sleep quality. Television and computer game exposure affect children's sleep and deteriorate verbal cognitive performance.&lt;ref name="pediatrics.aappublications.org"/&gt;

Another problem that has developed due to increased media consumption is that people are becoming less independent. With [[text messaging]] and social media, people want [[instant gratification]] from their friends and often feel hurt if they do not receive an immediate response. Instead of having [[self-validation]], people often need validation from others.&lt;ref name="Turkle 2011 Chapter 9"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turkle|first=Sherry|title=Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other|year=2011|publisher=Basic Books|at=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue with independence is that since children frequently get cellphones when they are very young, they are always connected and never truly alone. Today, many children do not have the [[rite of passage]] of being on their own because they can always call their parents if they need help or are frightened.&lt;ref name="Turkle 2011 Chapter 9"/&gt;

Minorities are often put in a negative light in the media as well, with blacks being portrayed as criminals, Hispanics portrayed as illegal aliens, and people from the Middle East portrayed as terrorists. Research has shown that consuming much media with headlines that depict minorities in negative ways can affect how people think.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callanan|first=Valerie|year=2012|title=Media Consumption, Perceptions of Crime Risk and Fear of Crime: Examining Race/Ethnic Differences|url=http://proxygsu-alta.galileo.usg.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/952541470?accountid=14055|journal=Media Consumption, Perceptions of Crime Risk and Fear of Crime: Examining Race/Ethnic Differences|volume=55|pages=93–115|doi=10.1525/sop.2012.55.1.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="Berg, Patricia 2007" /&gt;

==Effects on Self-Esteem ==
Media has played a huge role in society for years in selling people on the expectations of how an ideal male and female body should look. These images of the "ideal body" can have a very negative effect on self-esteem in both men and women.&lt;ref name="Paxton, S. J. 2006"/&gt; These images can play significant roll in eating disorders in men and women as well.&lt;ref name="Wright &amp; Pritchard" /&gt; The idea of body comparison goes back to Festinger's (1954) Social Comparison Theory. Festinger argues that individuals make body comparisons in areas for which they relate. If someone who is over weight and is an environment that focuses on health, thinness, or body images (e.g. the gym or the beach) they may be more likely to see thinness as an ideal that can increase dissatisfaction with their own body.The more a person engages in body comparison, the more likely they may struggle with low self-esteem and a negative body image.&lt;ref name="Berg, Patricia 2007"/&gt; Women are sold to believe that to be beautiful, they must be a size zero and have long legs.  Men are sold the notion that they must big biceps and zero body fat. Reading magazines with images of toned muscular men has been reported to lower body and self-esteem in men and they start worrying more about their own health and physical fitness.&lt;ref name="Hobza et al." /&gt;

== Social Media ==
The amount of time spent on social media can inform people about their self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Andreassen, C.S. Curr Addict Rep (2015) 2: 175. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-015-0056-9&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that individuals with lower self-esteem may have an easier time expressing themselves on social media rather than in the real world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many people use metrics such as how many people are following them and likes to measure acceptance or rejection from peers. One study from the ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', argues that individuals who feel accepted and part of the "in crowd" have a higher sense of self-esteem than those who do not feel as though they are a part of these crowds.&lt;ref name="L. Burrow, Anthony 2016"/&gt;

==Semiotics of American youth media consumption==
American youth have personal [[television set]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[iPod]]s and [[cell phone]]s all at their disposal. They spend more time with media than any single activity other than sleeping.  As of 2008, the average American age 8 to 18 reported more than 6 hours of daily media use. The growing phenomenon of "[[media multitasking]]"—using several forms of media at the same time—multiplies that figure to 8.5 hours of media exposure daily. Media exposure begins early, increases until children begin school, then climbs to peak at almost 8 hours daily among 11 and 12-year-old children. Media exposure is positively related to risk-taking behaviors and is negatively related to personal adjustment and school performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=D|first2=Ulla|last2=Foehr|title=Trends in Media Use|journal=The Future of Children|year=2008|volume=18|issue=1|pages=11–37|doi=10.1353/foc.0.0000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of [[teenager]]s ages 12 to 17, 78% have a cell phone, and 47% of those own [[smartphone]]s. 23% of teens have a [[tablet computer]] and 93% have a computer or access to one at home. Of teenagers ages 14 to 17, 74% access the Internet on [[mobile device]]s occasionally. One in four teens are cell-mostly users, meaning that when accessing the Internet, they mostly use their cell phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teens and Technology 2013|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2013/PIP_TeensandTechnology2013.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media consumption, especially [[social media]] consumption, plays a major role in the [[socialization]] and social habits of [[adolescent]]s. Socializing through media differs from socializing through school, community, family, and other social situations. Since the adolescents have a greater control over their media choices than over other social situations face-to-face, many develop self-socialization. This is where we actively influence our own social development and outcomes because of the vast array of choices. Adolescents can choose media that best fits their personalities and preferences, which in turn create youth that have a skewed view of the world and limited [[social interaction]] skills. Socialization can be awkward for youth, especially with the integration of media. Media, parents, and peers may all convey differing messages to adolescents. With multiple views of how to approach a situation, confusion can be apparent and the youth may often give up or internalize their social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnett|first=J|title=Adolescents' uses of media for self-socialization|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|year=1995|volume=24|issue=5|pages=519–533|doi=10.1007/bf01537054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social semiotics]] make up a large part of how adolescents learn and employ social interaction. Impressionable adolescents regularly imitate the sign systems they see in the media. These [[semiotic]] systems affect their behavior through [[connotations]], [[narratives]], and [[myths]]. Adolescents are shaped by the sign systems in the media they consume. For example, many young girls in the 1990s dressed and acted like the [[Spice Girls]], a popular band. Similarly, [[boy bands]] created a trend of many teenage boys frosting their hair in the early 2000s. With more exposure to the media and images of models, young women are more likely to conform to the ideal of being thin. [[Anorexia nervosa|Anorexia]], [[bulimia]] and models smoking convey to girls that a feminine person is thin, beautiful, and must do certain things to her body to be attractive. A code of femininity (see [[media and gender]]) implies today that a "true" woman is thin, girlish, frail, passive, and focused on serving others.  On the other hand, the code of masculinity for a young boy growing up in our culture may include the ideals of cowboys and secret agents. The images, myths, and narratives of these ideas imply that a "true" man is a problem solver, physically strong, emotionally inexpressive, and a daredevil who doesn't care about rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dotson|first=M. J.|first2=E. M.|last2=Hyatt|title=Major influence factors in children's consumer socialization|journal=Journal of Consumer Marketing|volume=22|issue=1|pages=35–42|doi=10.1108/07363760510576536|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flood of signs, images, narratives, and myths surrounding us influence our behavior by the use of codes. [[Codes]] are maps of meaning, systems of signs that people use to interpret their own and others' behavior. Codes connect semiotic systems of meaning with social structure and values. The idea of being judged on femininity or clothing relates to experiences later in life with job interviews and being successful.&lt;ref name="Semiotics and Advertising"&gt;{{cite web|title=Semiotics and Advertising|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~tstreete/semiotics_and_ads/index.html|accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signs, myths, and codes do not affect us physically like a drug, but psychologically. We think with signs, though we don't eat, breathe, or physically interact with them. The power that sign systems have is their role in generating and maintaining shared expectations and shared interpretive frameworks. [[Sign]]s do not force us to have certain interpretations. They open a door, creating the context for other people's interpretations of us, and even more importantly, our own expectations of what others think. Sign systems are merely tools, but they have become the common currency for communicating. Signs have become something we can accept or criticize, but not ignore.&lt;ref name="Semiotics and Advertising"/&gt;

Media consumption has become part of our culture code and has shaped the youth through socialization and how they interpret the signs and world around them. For example, older generations see the symbol for a phone and think that it is something to call someone with. The younger generations, especially the youth now, see a phone as a mini-computer and a way to avoid physical contact or face-to-face communication.

== Effect on Public Attitudes Regarding Crime and Justice==
[[File:Law and Order SVU.png|thumb|Law &amp; Order: SVU
Television viewers of crime based shows are more fearful of crime.
]]
Media consumption affects the public's perception of the justice system through the relationship of fear regarding crime, the perceived effectiveness of law enforcement, and the general attitudes about punishment for crime.  The law and the legal system have continually been portrayed in mass media through negative portrayals of criminals, deviants, and law enforcement officials, which in turn affects the overall perception of these by the public.

A research study done by Dowler in 2003, showed that the effects of media consumption does influence public attitudes regarding crime and justice.  In this study a relationship between media and crime was found to be dependent on characteristics of the message and receiving audience, where substantial amounts of local crimes reported raised fear, while lower crime amounts lead to a feeling of safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol10is2/dowler.html|title=Media consumption and public attitudes toward crime and justice: The relationship between fear of crime, punitive attitudes, and perceived police effectiveness|last=Dowler|first=K.|year=2003|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=109–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Gerbner's empirical studies of the impact of media consumption discovered that television viewers of crime based shows are more fearful of crime than those who are not consuming that type of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerbner|first=G.|last2=Gross|first2=L.|last3=Morgan|first3=M.|last4=Signorielli|first4=N.|date=1986|title=Living with television: The dynamics of the cultivation process|url=http://wiki.commres.org/pds/CultivationTheory/LivingWithTelevision_TheDynamicsoftheCultivationProcess.pdf|journal=Perspectives on media effects|volume=|pages=17–40|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Chermak, McGarrell, &amp; Gruenewald focused on media coverage of police misconduct which produced results where the more the citizens consumed the misconduct media the more they believed in the officer's guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chermak|first=S.|last2=McGarrell|first2=E.|last3=Gruenewald|first3=J.|date=2006-04-01|title=Media coverage of police misconduct and attitudes toward police|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/13639510610667664|journal=Policing: An International Journal|volume=29|issue=2|pages=261–281|doi=10.1108/13639510610667664|issn=1363-951X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings showed the more a citizen exposed themselves to media consumption regarding a specific case, the more likely they felt about the officer's guilt.  This same study also indicated that race effects were more pronounced after media coverage of the case.  The indication that news consumption had no significant effects on the general attitudes towards police, police services, or concerns about police harassment were also concluded.

      <comment>This is a misreading of Aristotle's position, see Poetics p.4 ISBN 014-04-4636-2, Aristotle specifically defines poetry as written language and even notes that the term is often incorrectly applied to people who write non-fiction in verse form</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8170">{{Other uses|Mode (disambiguation){{!}}Mode}}

In [[literature]] and other artistic media, a '''mode''' is an unspecific critical term usually designating a broad but identifiable kind of [[literary method]], [[Mood (literature)|mood]], or manner that is not tied exclusively to a particular [[List of narrative forms|form]] or [[Literary genre|genre]]. Examples are the ''satiric'' mode, the ''ironic'', the ''comic'', the ''pastoral'', and the ''didactic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] uses 'mode' in a more specific sense. Kinds of poetry, he writes, may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'' of [[mimesis|imitation]], according to their ''objects'' of imitation, and according to their mode or 'manner' of imitation (section I). "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section III). According to this definition, 'narrative' and 'dramatic' are modes of fiction:
:"This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in Aristotle's differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''[[mimesis]]'' (direct imitation). It has, as we shall see, important consequences for both the logic and the language of the drama."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Elam|1980|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction-writing==
[[Fiction]] is a form of [[narrative]], one of the four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse.  Fiction-writing also has distinct forms of expression, or modes, each with its own purposes and conventions.  Agent and author [[Evan Marshall (agent)|Evan Marshall]] identifies five [[fiction-writing mode]]s: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Marshall|1998|pp=143–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author and writing-instructor [[Jessica Page Morrell]] lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Morrell|2006|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Selgin|2007|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summarization===
Summarization (also referred to as summary, narration, or narrative summary) is the fiction-writing mode whereby story events are condensed.  The reader is told what happens, rather than having it shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Marshall|1998|pp=144–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fiction-writing axiom "[[Show, don't tell]]" the "tell" is often in the form of summarization.

Summarization has important uses:
* To connect one part of a story to another
* To report events whose details aren't important
* To telescope time
* To convey an emotional state over an extended period of time&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Marshall|1998|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To vary the rhythm and texture of the writing&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Browne|King|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of summary is that it takes up less space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Selgin|2007|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to author [[Orson Scott Card]], either action or summarization could be right, either could be wrong.  Factors such as rhythm, pace, and tone come into play.  The objective is to get the right balance between telling versus showing, action versus summarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Card|1988|pp=140–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introspection===
{{main|Introspection}}
Introspection (also referred to as internal dialogue, interior monologue, self-talk) is the fiction-writing mode used to convey a character's thoughts.  As explained by Renni Browne and Dave King, "One of the great gifts of literature is that it allows for the expression of unexpressed thoughts ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Browne|King|2004|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Nancy Kress]], a character's thoughts can greatly enhance a story: deepening characterization, increasing tension, and widening the scope of a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kress|2003|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As outlined by Jack M. Bickham, thought plays a critical role in both [[scene (fiction)|scene]] and [[sequel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bickham|1993|pp=12–22,50–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essay-writing==
According to Frederick Crews, it is traditional and useful to think of essays as falling into four types, corresponding to four basic functions of prose:  ''description'', or picturing; ''narration'', or telling; ''exposition'', or explaining; and ''argument'', or convincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Anker distinguishes between nine different modes of essay writing:  ''narration'', or writing that tells stories; ''illustration'', or writing that gives examples; ''description'', or writing that creates pictures in words; ''process analysis'', or writing that explains how things happen; ''classification'', or writing that sorts things into groups; ''definition'', or writing that tells what something means; ''comparison and contrast'', or writing that shows similarities and differences; ''cause and effect'', or writing that explains reasons or results; and ''argument'', or writing that persuades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Anker|2004|pp=97–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Music]] can be described and represented in many different ways including [[sheet music]], symbolic representations, and audio recordings. For each of these representations, there may exist different versions that correspond to the same musical work. The general goal of '''music alignment''' (sometimes also referred to as '''music synchronization''') is to automatically link the various data streams, thus interrelating the multiple information sets related to a given musical work. More precisely, music alignment is taken to mean a procedure which, for a given position in one representation of a piece of music, determines the corresponding position within another representation.&lt;ref name=Mueller15_Chapter3FMP_SPRINGER&gt;

==Basic procedure==
[[File:MusicAlignment Procedure.png|thumb|300px|right|Overview of the processing pipeline of a typical music alignment procedure.]]

Given two different music representations, typical music alignment approaches proceed in two steps.&lt;ref name=Mueller15_Chapter3FMP_SPRINGER/&gt; In the first step, the two representations are transformed into sequences of suitable features. In general, such feature representations need to find a compromise between two conflicting goals. On the one hand, features should show a large degree of [[robustness]] to variations that are to be left unconsidered for the task at hand. On the other hand, features should capture enough characteristic information to accomplish the given task. For music alignment, one often uses '''[[chroma feature|chroma-based features]]''' (also called [[chromagram]]s or [[harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]]), which capture harmonic and melodic characteristics of music, while being robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation, are being used.

In the second step, the derived feature sequences have to be brought into (temporal) correspondence. To this end, techniques related to '''[[dynamic time warping|dynamic time warping (DTW)]]''' or '''[[hidden Markov model|hidden Markov models (HMMs)]]''' are used to compute an optimal alignment between two given feature sequences.

==Related tasks==
Music alignment and related synchronization tasks have been studied extensively within the field of [[music information retrieval]]. In the following, we give some pointers to related tasks. Depending upon the respective types of music representations, one can distinguish between various synchronization scenarios. For example, audio alignment refers to the task of temporally aligning two different audio recordings of a piece of music. Similarly, the goal of score–audio alignment is to coordinate note events given in the score representation with audio data. In the  [[offline]] scenario, the two data streams to be aligned are known prior to the actual alignment. In this case, one can use global optimization procedures such as [[dynamic time warping|dynamic time warping (DTW)]] to find an optimal alignment. In general, it is harder to deal with scenarios where the data streams are to be processed online. One prominent online scenario is known as '''[[score following]]''', where a musician is performing a piece according to a given musical score. The goal is then to identify the currently played musical events depicted in the score with high accuracy and low latency.&lt;ref&gt;

In this context, alignment techniques such as hidden Markov models or particle filters have been employed, where the current score position and tempo are modeled in a statistical sense.&lt;ref&gt;

However, as a main disadvantage, an online strategy is very sensitive to local tempo variations and deviations from the score - once the procedure is out of sync, it is very hard to recover and return to the right track. A further online synchronization problem is known as '''[[Pop music automation#Automatic accompaniment|automatic accompaniment]]'''. Having a solo part played by a musician, the task of the computer is to accompany the musician according to a given score by adjusting the tempo and other parameters in real time. Such systems were already proposed some decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When analysing the regularities and structure of [[music]] as well as the processing of music in the [[brain]], certain findings lead to the question of whether music is based on a [[syntax]] that could be compared with [[linguistic syntax]]. To get closer to this question it is necessary to have a look at the basic aspects of syntax in [[language]], as language unquestionably presents a complex syntactical system. If music has a matchable syntax, noteworthy equivalents to basic aspects of linguistic syntax have to be found in musical structure. By implication the processing of music in comparison to language could also give information about the structure of music.

==Comparison to linguistic syntax==
Syntax in general can be referred to as a study of the principles and rules needed for the construction of a language or as a term in particular describing these principles and rules for a special language.

===Linguistic syntax – three principles&lt;ref name=Patel2008&gt;Patel, A.D. (2008). Music, Language, and the Brain. Oxford University Press, USA&lt;/ref&gt;===
Linguistic syntax is especially marked by its structural richness, which becomes apparent in its multi layered organization as well as in the strong relationship between syntax and meaning. That is that there are special linguistic syntactic principles that define how the language is formed out of different subunits, such as words out of [[morphemes]], phrases out of words and sentences out of phrases. Furthermore, linguistic syntax is featured by the fact that a word can take on abstract [[grammatical functions]] that are less defined through properties of the word itself and more through the context and structural relations. This is for example that every [[noun]] can be used as a [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[object (grammar)|object]] or [[indirect object]], but without a sentence as the normal context of a word, no statement about its [[grammatical function]] can be made. At last, linguistic syntax is marked by abstractness. This means that only conventional structural relations and not psychoacoustic relationships are the basis for the linguistic syntax.

===Musical syntax&lt;ref name=Patel2008/&gt;===
Concerning musical syntax these three aspects of richness in linguistic syntax as well as the abstractness should be found in music too, if one wants to claim that music has a comparable syntax. An annotation that has to be made concerns the fact that most of the studies dealing with musical syntax are confined to the consideration of Western European tonal music. Thus this article can also only focus on [[tonality|Western tonal music]].

====Multilayered organization====
Considering the multilayered organization of music, three levels of [[pitch organization]] can be found in music.

=====Scale degrees=====
The lowest level are [[musical scales]], which consist of seven tones or "scale degrees" per [[octave]] and have an asymmetric pattern of [[interval (music)|intervals]] between them (for example the C-major scale). They are built up out of the 12 possible [[pitch class]]es per octave (A, A{{music|#}},B, C, C{{music|#}}, D, D{{music|#}}, E, F, F{{music|#}}, G, G{{music|#}}) and the different scale tones are not equal in their structural stability. Empirical evidence indicates that there is a hierarchy concerning the stability of the single tones. The most stable one is called the "[[tonic (music)|tonic]]" and embodies the tonal centre of the scale. The most unstable tones were the ones closest to the tonic (scale degrees 2 and 7), which are called the "[[supertonic]]" and the "[[leading tone]]". In studies scale degrees 1, 3 and 5 have been judged as closely related. It was also shown that an implicit knowledge of scale structure has to be learned and developed in childhood and is not inborn.

=====Chord structure=====
The next superordinate level of pitch organization is the [[chord (music)|chord]] structure, which means that three scale tones with a distance of two scale steps each are played simultaneously and are therefore combined into chords. When building up chords on the basis of a musical scale there are three different kinds of chords resulting, namely "major"(e.g. C-E-G), "minor" (e.g. D-F-A) and "diminished" (e.g. B-D-F) triads. This is due to the asymmetric intervals between the scale tones. These asymmetric intervals effect, that a distance of two scale steps can comprise either three or four semitones and therefore be an interval of a minor (with three semitones) or a major (with four semitones) third. A [[major triad]] consists of a major third followed by a minor third and is built on scale degrees 1, 3 and 5 (or 4, 6 and 1, for the subdominant, and 5, 7 and 2, for the dominant, the other two major triads that can be formed from the major scale). A [[minor triad]] consists of a minor third followed by a major third and is built on scale degrees 2, 4 and 6 (or 3, 5 and 7, for the mediant, and 6, 1 and 4, for the submediant). Only on scale degree 7 the triad consists of two minor thirds and is therefore defined as a [[diminished triad]].
Chordal syntax touches mainly four basic aspects. The first is, that the lowest [[Musical note|note]] in each triad functions as a fundament of the chord and therefore as the structural most important pitch. The chord is named after this note as well as the chord's harmonic label is grounded on it. The second aspect is, that chord syntax provides norms for altering chords by additional tones. One example is the addition of a fourth tone to a triad, which is the seventh tone of the scale (e.g. in a C-major scale the addition of F to the triad G-B-D would lead to a so-called "[[dominant seventh chord]]"). Concerning norms for the progression of chords in time the third aspect focuses on the relationship between chords. The patterning of chords in a [[cadence (music)|cadence]] for example indicates a movement from a V chord to a I chord. The fact that the I chord is perceived as a resting point in a musical phrase implicates, that the single chords built up on notes of a scale are not equal in there stability but show the same differences in stability as the notes of the scale do. This describes the fourth basic aspect of chordal syntax. The tonic chord (the one built on the tonic, C-E-G in C-major, for example) is the most stable and central chord, followed by the dominant chord (built on the 5th scale degree) and the subdominant chord (built on the 4th scale degree).
"

=====Key structure=====
The highest level of pitch organization can be seen in [[key (music)|key structure]]. In Western European tonal music the key is based on a scale with its associated chords and chord relations. Scales can be built up as minor or major scales (differing in the succession of intervals between the scale tones) on each of the 12 pitch classes and therefore there are 24 possible keys in tonal music. Analysing [[key (music)|key]] structure in context of musical syntax means to examine the relationship between keys in a piece of music. Usually, not only one key is used to build up a composition, but also so-called key "[[modulation]]s" (in other words the alteration of keys) are utilized. In these modulations a certain recurring pattern can be perceived. Switches from one key to another are often found between related keys. Three general principles for relationship between keys can be postulated on the basis of perceptual experiments and also neural evidence for implicit knowledge of key structure. Looking at the C-major key as an example, there are three close related keys: G-major, A-minor and C-minor. C-major and G-major are keys whose 1st scale degrees are separated by a musical fifth (the pattern of relations is represented in the [[circle of fifths]]" for major keys). A-minor and C-major share the same notes of the scale but with a different tonic (so-called [[relative minor key]], i.e. C-major and A-minor). And C-major and C-minor have the same tonic in their scales.
All in all it can be said that music like the human language has a considerable multi layered organization.

====Hierarchical structure====
Considering the last two basic aspects of linguistic syntax, namely the considerable significance of the order of subunits for the meaning of a sentence as well as the fact that words undertake abstract grammatical functions defined through context and structural relations, it seems to be useful to analyse the hierarchical structure of music to find correlations in music.

=====Ornamentation=====
One aspect of hierarchical structure of music is the [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]]. The meaning of the word "ornamentation" points to the fact that there are events in a musical context that are less important to form an idea of the general gist of a sequence than others. The decision on the importance of events not only comprises harmonic considerations, but also rhythmic and motivic information. But a classification of events simply into ornamental and structural events would be too superficial. In fact the most common hypothesis implies, that music is organized into structural levels, which can be pictured as branches of a tree. A pitch that is structural at a higher level may be ornamental at a deeper level. This can be compared with the hierarchical syntactic structure of a [[sentence (music)|sentence]] in which there are structural elements that are necessary to build up a sentence like the noun phrase and the verb phrase but looking at a deeper level the structural elements also contain additional or ornamental constituents.

=====Tension and resolution=====
Searching for other aspects of hierarchical structure of music there is a controversial discussion, if the organization of [[Tension (music)|tension]] and [[Resolution (music)|resolution]] in music can be described as hierarchical structure or only as a purely sequential structure. According to [[Patel]]&lt;ref name =Patel2008/&gt; research in this area has produced apparently contradictory evidence, and more research is needed to answer this question.
The question concerning the kind of structure that features tension and resolution in music is linked very close to the relationship between order and meaning in music. Considering tension and resolution as one possible kind of meaning in music a hierarchical structure would imply that a change of order of musical elements would have an influence on the meaning of the music.

====Abstractness====
The last aspect to examine is the [[abstraction|abstractness]] of linguistic syntax and its correlate in music. There are two contradicting points of views. The first one claims that the foundation for musical scales and for the existence of a [[tonal centre]] in music can be seen in the physical basis of [[overtone]] series or in the psychoacoustic properties of chord in tonal music respectively. But in recent time there is strong evidence for the second point of view that syntax reflects abstract cognitive relationships.

All in all the consideration of syntax in music and language shows, that music has a syntax comparable to the linguistic syntax especially concerning a great complexity and a hierarchical organization. Nevertheless, it has to be emphasized, that musical syntax is not a simple variant of linguistic syntax, but a similar complex system with its own substance. That means that it would be the wrong way just to search for musical analogies of linguistic syntactic entities such as nouns or verbs.

==Neuronal processing of musical and linguistic syntax==

Investigating the neuronal processing of musical syntax can serve two proposed aspects.'''&lt;ref&gt;Patel, A.D. (2003). Language, music, syntax and the brain. Nature Neuroscience. 6(7):674-681&lt;/ref&gt;''' The first is to learn more about the processing of music in general. That is, which areas of the [[brain]] are involved and if there are specific markers of brain activity due to the processing of music and musical syntax. The second aspect is to compare the processing of musical and linguistic syntax to find out, if they have an effect upon each other or if there even is a significant overlap. The verification of an overlap would support the thesis, that syntactic operations (musical as well as linguistic) are modular. "Modular" means, that the complex system of processing is decomposed into subsystems with modular functions. Concerning the processing of syntax this would mean, that the [[domain knowledge|domain]] of music and language each have specific syntactic representations, but that they share [[neural resources]] for activating and integrating these representations during [[syntactic processing]].

===Processing of music and musical syntax===

====Requirements====

Processing of music and musical syntax comprises several aspects concerning melodic, rhythmic, metric, timbral and harmonic structure. For the processing of [[Diatonic function|chord functions]] four steps in processing can be described.
(1)Primarily, a tonal centre has to be detected out of the first chords of a sequence. Often the first chord is interpreted as the tonal centre of a sequence and a reevaluation is necessary, if the first chord has another harmonic function.
(2)Successive chords are related to this tonal centre concerning their [[harmonic distance]] from the tonal centre.
(3)As described above (Does music have a syntax?), music has a hierarchical structure in terms of pitch organization and organization of tensioning and releasing in music. Pitch organization concerning chords means, that in a musical phrase the tonic is the most stable chord and experienced as the resting point. The dominant and subdominant anon are more stable than the submediant and the supertonic. The progression of chords in time forms a tonal structure based on pitch organization, in which moving away from the tonic is perceived as tensioning and moving towards the tonic is experienced as releasing. Therefore, hierarchical relations may convey organized patterns of meaning.
(4)Concerning harmonic aspects of major-minor tonal music, Musical syntax can be characterized by statistical regularities in the succession of chord functions in time, that is probabilities of chord transitions. As these regularities are stored in a [[long-term memory]], predictions about following chords are made automatically, when listening to a musical phrase.

====MMN and ERAN&lt;ref&gt;Koelsch, S. (2009). "Music-syntactic Processing and Auditory Memory – Similarities and Differences between ERAN and MMN". Psychophysiology, 46(1): 179-190.&lt;/ref&gt;====

The violation of these automatically made predictions lead to the observation of so-called [[Event-related potential|ERPs]] (event related potential, a stereotyped electrophysiological response to an internal or external stimulus). Two forms of ERPs can be detected in the context of processing music. One is the [[Mismatch negativity|MMN]] (mismatch negativity), which has first been investigated only with physical deviants like [[frequency]], [[sound intensity]], [[timbre]] deviants (referred to as [[phMMN]]) and could now also be shown for changes of abstract auditory features like tone pitches (referred to as [[afMMN]]). The other one is the so-called [[Electroencephalography|ERAN]] (early right anterior negativity), which can be elicited by syntactic irregularities in music. Both the ERAN and the MMN are ERPs indicating a mismatch between predictions based on regularities and actually experienced acoustic information. As for a long time it seemed to be, that the ERAN is a special variant of the MMN, the question arises, why they are told apart today. There are several differences between the MMN and the ERAN found in the last years:

=====Differences – occurrence=====
Even though music syntactic regularities are often simultaneously acoustical similar and music syntactic irregularities are often simultaneously acoustical different, an ERAN but not an MMN can be elicit, when a chord does not represent a physical but a syntactic deviance. To demonstrate this, so-called "Neapolitan sixth chords" are used. These are consonant chords when played solitary, but which are added into a musical phrase of in which they are only distantly related to the harmonic context. Added into a chord sequence of five chords, the addition of a [[Neapolitan sixth chord]] at the third or at the fifth position evokes different amplitudes of ERANs in the [[EEG]] with a higher [[amplitude]] at the fifth position. Nevertheless, when creating a chord sequence in which the [[Neapolitan chord]] at the fifth position is music-syntactically less irregular than a Neapolitan chord at the third position, the amplitude is higher at the third position (see figure 4...). In opposition to the MMN, a clear ERAN is also elicited by using syntactically irregular chords, which are acoustically more similar to a proceeding harmonic context than syntactically regular chords. Therefore, the MMN seems to be based on an on-line establishment of regularities. That means, that the regularities are extracted on-line from the acoustic environment. In opposition, the ERAN rests upon representations of music-syntactic regularities which exist in a [[long-term memory]] format and which are learned during early childhood.

=====Differences – development=====
This is represented in the development of the ERAN and MMN. The ERAN cannot be verified in newborn babies, whereas the MMN can actually be demonstrated in [[fetus]]. In two-year-old children, the ERAN is very small, in five-year-old children a clear ERAN is found, but with a longer latency than in adults. With the age of 11 years children show an ERAN similar to ERANs in adults. Out of these observation the thesis can be built that the MMN is essential for the establishment and maintenance of representations of the acoustic environment and for processes of the auditory scene analysis. But only the ERAN is completely based on learning to build up a structural model, which is established with reference to representations of syntactic regularities already existing in a long-term memory format. Considering effects of [[training]] both the ERAN and the MMN can be modulated by training.

=====Differences – neural sources=====
Differences between the ERAN and the MMN also exist in the [[neural sources]] for the main contributions to the ERPs. The sources for the ERAN are located in the [[pars opercularis]] of the [[inferior fronto-lateral cortex]] (inferior [[Brodmann's area]] with contributions from the ventrolateral [[premotor cortex]] and the [[anterior superior temporal gyrus]], whereas the MMN receives its main contributions from and within the vicinity of the [[primary auditory cortex]] with additional sources in the [[frontal cortex|frontal cortical areas]]. Therefore, the sources for the ERAN basically lie in the frontal cortex whereas the sources for the MMN are located in the [[temporal lobe]]. Other hints for this thesis emerge from the fact that under a [[propofol]] sedation which mainly affects the frontal cortex, the ERAN is abolished while the MMN is only reduced. At last, the amplitude of the ERAN is reduced under ignore conditions whereas the MMN is largely unaffected by attentional modulations.

=====Processes to elicit the MMN or ERAN=====

(1)First, a separation of sound sources, an extraction of sound features and the establishment of representations of auditory objects of the incoming acoustic input have to be made. The same processes are required for the MMN and ERAN.

(2)For the MMN regularities are filtered on-line out of the input to create a model of the acoustic environment. At this point, there is a difference to the ERAN as for the ERAN representations of regularities already exist in a long-term memory format and the incoming sound is integrated into a pre existent model of [[musical form|musical structure]].

(3)According to the model of musical structure, predictions concerning forthcoming auditory events are formed. This process is similar for the ERAN and for the MMN.

(4)At least a comparison between the actually incoming sound and the predictions based on the model is made. This process is partly the same for the MMN and the ERAN as well.

=== Comparison of the processing of musical and linguistic syntax&lt;ref name=Patel2008/&gt;===

As the ERAN is similar to an ERP called [[Early Left Anterior Negativity|ELAN]] which can be elicited by violation of linguistic syntax it seems to be obvious that the ERAN really represents syntactic processing. Deduced from this thought an interaction between music-syntactic and language-syntactic processing would be very likely.There are different possibilities in [[neuroscience]] to approach to an answer to the question of an overlap between the neuronal processing of linguistic and musical syntax.

====Neuropsychological approach====
This method deals with the question, how structure and function of the [[brain]] relate to outcomes in behaviour and other psychological processes. From this area of research there has been evidence for the dissociation between musical and linguistic syntactic abilities. In case reports it was possible to show that [[amusia]] ( a deficiency in fine-grainded perception of pitch which leads to musical tone-deafness and can be congenital or acquired later in life as from brain damage) is not necessarily linked to [[aphasia]] (severe language impairments following brain damage) and vice versa. This means that individuals with normal speech and language abilities showed musical tone-deafness as well as individuals with language impairments had sufficient means of musical syntactic abilities. The problem of neuropsychologic research is that there has not been a former case report which showed that aphasia does not necessarily entail amusia in non-musicians, to the contrary newer findings suggest that amusia is almost always linked to aphasia.

====Neuroimaging====
Furthermore, results from [[neuroimaging]] led to the "[[shared syntactic integration resource hypothesis]]" (SSIRH), which supports the presumption, that there is an overlap between the processing of musical and linguistic syntax and that syntactic operations are modular. Furthermore, research using the method of [[electroencephalography]] has shown that a difficulty or irritation in musical as well as in linguistic syntax elicit ERPs which are similar to each other.

How can the discrepancy between [[neuropsychology]] and neuroimaging be explained?

====Modularity====
In fact, the concept of modularity itself can help to understand the different and apparently contradicting findings in neuropsychologic research and neuroimaging. Introducing the concept of a dual system, in which there is a distinction between syntactic representation and syntactic processing, this could mean, that there is a distinction between long-term structural knowledge in a [[domain knowledge|domain]] (representation) and operations conducted on that knowledge (syntactic processing). A damage in an area representing long-term musical knowledge would lead to amusia without aphasia, but a damage in an area representing syntactic processing would cause an impairment of both musical and linguistic syntactic processing.

====Comparison of syntactic processing-three theories====
The comparison of the syntactic processing of language and music is based on three theories which should be mentioned but which are not explained in detail. The first two, the "dependency locality theory" and the "expectancy theory" refer to syntactic processing in language, whereas the third one, the "tonal pitch space theory", relates to the syntactic processing in music.

The language theories contribute to the concept that in order to conceive the structure of a sentence, resources are consumed. If the conception of a this structure is difficult due to the fact that distant words belong to each other or an expected structure of the sentence is violated, more resources, namely the ones for activating low-activation items, are consumed.

Violating an anticipated structure in music could mean a harmonically unexpected note or chord in a musical sequence. As in language this is associated with a "processing cost due to the tonal distance" (Patel, 2008) and therefore means that more resources are needed for activating low-activation items.

====SSIRH – the leading concept====
Overall these theories lead to the "shared syntactic integration resources hypothesis" as the areas from which low-activation items are activated could be the correlate to the overlap between linguistic and musical syntax.
Strong evidence for the existence of this overlap comes from studies, in which music-syntactic and a linguistic-syntactic irregularities were presented simultaneously. They showed an interaction between the ERAN and the [[LAN]] (left anterior negativity;ERP which is elicited by linguistic-syntactic irregularities). The LAN elicited was reduced when an irregular word was presented simultaneously with an irregular chord compared to the condition when an irregular word was presented with a regular chord. Contrary to this finding the phMMN elicited by frequency deviants did not interact with the LAN.

From this facts it can be reasoned that the ERAN relies on neural resources related to syntactic processing (Koelsch 2008). Furthermore, they give strong evidence for the thesis, that there is an overlap between the processing of musical and linguistic syntax and therefore that syntactic operations (musical as well as linguistic) are modular.

{{Nuclear physics}}

'''Nuclear physics''' is the field of [[physics]] that studies [[atomic nuclei]] and their constituents and interactions. Other forms of [[nuclear matter]] are also studied.&lt;ref name=nupecc_report&gt;{{cite report

Nuclear physics should not be confused with [[atomic physics]], which studies the [[atom]] as a whole, including its [[electron]]s.

Discoveries in nuclear physics have led to [[nuclear technology|applications]] in many fields. This includes [[nuclear power]], [[nuclear weapons]], [[nuclear medicine]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]], industrial and agricultural isotopes, [[ion implantation]] in [[materials engineering]], and [[radiocarbon dating]] in [[geology]] and [[archaeology]]. Such applications are studied in the field of [[nuclear engineering]].

[[Particle physics]] evolved out of nuclear physics and the two fields are typically taught in close association. [[Nuclear astrophysics]], the application of nuclear physics to [[astrophysics]], is crucial in explaining the inner workings of [[stars]] and the [[nucleosynthesis|origin of the chemical elements]].

==History==
[[File:Portrait of Antoine-Henri Becquerel.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Becquerel]]]]
[[File:Cloud chambers played an important role of particle detectors.jpg|thumb|Since 1920s [[cloud chamber]]s played an important role of particle detectors and eventually lead to the discovery of [[positron]], [[muon]] and [[kaon]].]]

The history of nuclear physics as a discipline distinct from [[atomic physics]] starts with the discovery of [[radioactivity]] by [[Henri Becquerel]] in 1896,&lt;ref name=brm&gt;{{cite book

Thomson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first=Joseph John|author1-link=Joseph John Thomson|title=Cathode Rays|year=1897|journal=[[Royal Institution|Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain]]|volume=XV|pages=419–432|url=https://archive.org/stream/proceedings15roya#page/418/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; a year later was an indication that the atom had internal structure. At the beginning of the 20th century the accepted model of the atom was J. J. Thomson's [[Plum pudding model|"plum pudding" model]] in which the atom was a positively charged ball with smaller negatively charged electrons embedded inside it.

In the years that followed, radioactivity was extensively investigated, notably by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] as well as by [[Ernest Rutherford]] and his collaborators. By the turn of the century physicists had also discovered three types of [[radiation]] emanating from atoms, which they named [[alpha decay|alpha]], [[beta decay|beta]], and [[gamma decay|gamma]] radiation. Experiments by [[Otto Hahn]] in 1911 and by [[James Chadwick]] in 1914 discovered that the beta decay [[spectrum]] was continuous rather than discrete. That is, electrons were ejected from the atom with a continuous range of energies, rather than the discrete amounts of energy that were observed in gamma and alpha decays. This was a problem for nuclear physics at the time, because it seemed to indicate that [[conservation of energy|energy was not conserved]] in these decays.

The 1903 [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics was awarded jointly to Becquerel for his discovery and to Marie and Pierre Curie for their subsequent research into radioactivity. Rutherford was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908 for his "investigations into the disintegration of the elements and the chemistry of radioactive substances".

In 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] formulated the idea of [[mass–energy equivalence]]. While the work on radioactivity by Becquerel and Marie Curie predates this, an explanation of the source of the energy of radioactivity would have to wait for the discovery that the nucleus itself was composed of smaller constituents, the [[nucleon]]s.

=== Rutherford's team discovers the nucleus ===
In 1906 [[Ernest Rutherford]] published "Retardation of the α Particle from Radium in passing through matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rutherford|first=Ernest|author-link1=Ernest Rutherford|title=On the retardation of the α particle from radium in passing through matter|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]|year=1906|volume=12|number=68|pages=134–146|doi=10.1080/14786440609463525}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Geiger]] expanded on this work in a communication to the [[Royal Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geiger|first=Hans|author-link1=Hans Geiger|title=On the scattering of α-particles by matter|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|year=1908|volume=81|number=546|pages=174–177|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/81/546/174|doi=10.1098/rspa.1908.0067 |bibcode=1908RSPSA..81..174G}}&lt;/ref&gt; with experiments he and Rutherford had done, passing alpha particles through air, aluminum foil and gold leaf. More work was published in 1909 by Geiger and [[Ernest Marsden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Geiger | first1 =Hans| author-link1=Hans Geiger|last2=Marsden|first2=Ernest|author-link2=Ernest Marsden| title=On the diffuse reflection of the α-particles | year =1909 | volume=82| pages =495|number=557|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/82/557/495 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1909.0054 |bibcode=1909RSPSA..82..495G}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further greatly expanded work was published in 1910 by Geiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geiger|first=Hans|author-link1=Hans Geiger|title=The scattering of the α-particles by matter|year=1910|volume=83|number=565|pages=492–504|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/83/565/492|doi=10.1098/rspa.1910.0038|bibcode=1910RSPSA..83..492G}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911–1912 Rutherford went before the Royal Society to explain the experiments and propound the new theory of the atomic nucleus as we now understand it.

The key experiment behind this announcement was performed in 1910 at the [[University of Manchester]]: Ernest Rutherford's team performed a remarkable [[Geiger–Marsden experiment|experiment]] in which Geiger and Marsden under Rutherford's supervision fired alpha particles ([[helium]] nuclei) at a thin film of [[gold]] foil. The [[plum pudding model]] had predicted that the alpha particles should come out of the foil with their trajectories being at most slightly bent. But Rutherford instructed his team to look for something that shocked him to observe: a few particles were scattered through large angles, even completely backwards in some cases. He likened it to firing a bullet at tissue paper and having it bounce off. The discovery, with Rutherford's analysis of the data in 1911, led to the Rutherford model of the atom, in which the atom had a very small, very dense nucleus containing most of its mass, and consisting of heavy positively charged particles with embedded electrons in order to balance out the charge (since the neutron was unknown). As an example, in this model (which is not the modern one) nitrogen-14 consisted of a nucleus with 14 protons and 7 electrons (21 total particles) and the nucleus was surrounded by 7 more orbiting electrons.

Around 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] anticipated the discovery and mechanism of [[nuclear fusion]] processes in [[star]]s, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.&lt;ref name=eddington&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eddington |first=A. S. |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |journal=The Scientific Monthly |volume=11 |issue=4 |year=1920 |pages=297–303 |jstor=6491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eddington2&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1916MNRAS..77...16E|title=On the radiative equilibrium of the stars|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=77|pages=16–35|author1=Eddington|first1=A. S.|year=1916|doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered.

The Rutherford model worked quite well until studies of [[spin (physics)|nuclear spin]] were carried out by [[Franco Rasetti]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1929. By 1925 it was known that protons and electrons each had a spin of {{frac|+/-1|2}}. In the Rutherford model of nitrogen-14, 20 of the total 21 nuclear particles should have paired up to cancel each other's spin, and the final odd particle should have left the nucleus with a net spin of {{frac|1|2}}. Rasetti discovered, however, that nitrogen-14 had a spin of 1.

=== James Chadwick discovers the neutron ===
{{Main|Discovery of the neutron}}
In 1932 Chadwick realized that radiation that had been observed by [[Walther Bothe]], [[Herbert Becker (physicist)|Herbert Becker]], [[Irène Joliot-Curie|Irène]] and [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]] was actually due to a neutral particle of about the same mass as the proton, that he called the [[neutron]] (following a suggestion from Rutherford about the need for such a particle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chadwick|first=James|author-link1=James Chadwick|title=The existence of a neutron|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|year=1932|volume=136|number=830|pages=692–708| url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/136/830/692|doi=10.1098/rspa.1932.0112 |bibcode=1932RSPSA.136..692C}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year [[Dmitri Ivanenko]] suggested that there were no electrons in the nucleus — only protons and neutrons — and that neutrons were spin {{frac|1|2}} particles which explained the mass not due to protons. The neutron spin immediately solved the problem of the spin of nitrogen-14, as the one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron in this model each contributed a spin of {{frac|1|2}} in the same direction, giving a final total spin of 1.

With the discovery of the neutron, scientists could at last calculate what fraction of [[binding energy]] each nucleus had, by comparing the nuclear mass with that of the protons and neutrons which composed it. Differences between nuclear masses were calculated in this way. When nuclear reactions were measured, these were found to agree with Einstein's calculation of the equivalence of mass and energy to within 1% as of 1934.

=== Proca's equations of the massive vector boson field ===
[[Alexandru Proca]] was the first to develop and report the massive vector [[boson]] [[field equation]]s and a theory of the [[meson]]ic field of [[nuclear force]]s. Proca's equations were known to [[Wolfgang Pauli]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Pauli'', Nobel lecture'', December 13, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; who mentioned the equations in his Nobel address, and they were also known to Yukawa, Wentzel, Taketani, Sakata, Kemmer, Heitler, and Fröhlich who appreciated the content of Proca's equations for developing a theory of the atomic nuclei in Nuclear Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1051/epn:2006504  |title=Alexandru Proca (1897–1955) and his equation of the massive vector boson field |first=Dorin N. |last=Poenaru |first2=Alexandru |last2=Calboreanu |journal=[[Europhysics News]]|via=http://www.europhysicsnews.org  |volume=37|issue=5|pages=25–27 |bibcode = 2006ENews..37...24P |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''G.

===Yukawa's meson postulated to bind nuclei===
In 1935 [[Hideki Yukawa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.11429/ppmsj1919.17.0_48}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the first significant theory of the [[strong force]] to explain how the nucleus holds together. In the [[Yukawa interaction]] a [[virtual particle]], later called a [[meson]], mediated a force between all nucleons, including protons and neutrons. This force explained why nuclei did not disintegrate under the influence of proton repulsion, and it also gave an explanation of why the attractive [[strong force]] had a more limited range than the electromagnetic repulsion between protons. Later, the discovery of the [[pi meson]] showed it to have the properties of Yukawa's particle.

With Yukawa's papers, the modern model of the atom was complete. The center of the atom contains a tight ball of neutrons and protons, which is held together by the strong nuclear force, unless it is too large. Unstable nuclei may undergo alpha decay, in which they emit an energetic helium nucleus, or beta decay, in which they eject an electron (or [[positron]]). After one of these decays the resultant nucleus may be left in an excited state, and in this case it decays to its ground state by emitting high energy photons (gamma decay).

The study of the strong and weak nuclear forces (the latter explained by [[Enrico Fermi]] via [[Fermi's interaction]] in 1934) led physicists to collide nuclei and electrons at ever higher energies. This research became the science of [[particle physics]], the crown jewel of which is the [[Standard Model|standard model of particle physics]] which describes the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces.

==Modern nuclear physics==
{{Main|Liquid-drop model|Nuclear shell model|Nuclear structure}}
A heavy nucleus can contain hundreds of [[nucleon]]s. This means that with some approximation it can be treated as a [[Newtonian mechanics|classical system]], rather than a [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] one. In the resulting [[liquid-drop model]],&lt;ref&gt;J.M.Blatt and V.F.Weisskopf, Theoretical Nuclear Physics, Springer, 1979, VII.5&lt;/ref&gt; the nucleus has an energy which arises partly from [[surface tension]] and partly from electrical repulsion of the protons. The liquid-drop model is able to reproduce many features of nuclei, including the general trend of [[binding energy]] with respect to mass number, as well as the phenomenon of [[nuclear fission]].

Superimposed on this classical picture, however, are quantum-mechanical effects, which can be described using the [[nuclear shell model]], developed in large part by [[Maria Goeppert Mayer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.75.1969|title = On Closed Shells in Nuclei. II|journal = Physical Review|volume = 75|issue = 12|pages = 1969–1970|year = 1949|last1 = Mayer|first1 = Maria Goeppert}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. Hans D. Jensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.75.1766.2|title = On the "Magic Numbers" in Nuclear Structure|journal = Physical Review|volume = 75|issue = 11|pages = 1766|year = 1949|last1 = Haxel|first1 = Otto|last2 = Jensen|first2 = J. Hans D|last3 = Suess|first3 = Hans E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclei with certain numbers of neutrons and protons (the [[Magic number (physics)|magic numbers]] 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126, ...) are particularly stable, because their [[Nuclear shell model|shells]] are filled.

Other more complicated models for the nucleus have also been proposed, such as the [[interacting boson model]], in which pairs of neutrons and protons interact as [[boson]]s, analogously to [[Cooper pair]]s of electrons.

[[ab initio methods (nuclear physics)|Ab initio methods]] try to solve the nuclear many-body problem from the ground up, starting from the nucleons and their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephenson|first1=C.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Topological properties of a self-assembled electrical network via ab initio calculation|journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7|issue=1|pages=932|date=2017|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-01007-9|pmid=28428625|pmc=5430567|bibcode=2017NatSR...7..932B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of current research in nuclear physics relates to the study of nuclei under extreme conditions such as high [[spin (physics)|spin]] and excitation energy. Nuclei may also have extreme shapes (similar to that of [[Rugby ball]]s or even [[pear]]s) or extreme neutron-to-proton ratios. Experimenters can create such nuclei using artificially induced fusion or nucleon transfer reactions, employing ion beams from an [[particle accelerator|accelerator]]. Beams with even higher energies can be used to create nuclei at very high temperatures, and there are signs that these experiments have produced a [[phase transition]] from normal nuclear matter to a new state, the [[quark–gluon plasma]], in which the [[quark]]s mingle with one another, rather than being segregated in triplets as they are in neutrons and protons.

===Nuclear decay===
{{Main|Radioactivity|Valley of stability}}
Eighty elements have at least one [[stable isotope]] which is never observed to decay, amounting to a total of about 254 stable isotopes. However, thousands of [[isotope]]s have been characterized as unstable. These "radioisotopes" decay over time scales ranging from fractions of a second to trillions of years.  Plotted on a chart as a function of atomic and neutron numbers, the binding energy of the nuclides forms what is known as the [[valley of stability]].  Stable nuclides lie along the bottom of this energy valley, while increasingly unstable nuclides lie up the valley walls, that is, have weaker binding energy.

The most stable nuclei fall within certain ranges or balances of composition of neutrons and protons: too few or too many neutrons (in relation to the number of protons) will cause it to decay. For example, in [[beta decay]] a [[nitrogen]]-16 atom (7 protons, 9 neutrons) is converted to an [[oxygen]]-16 atom (8 protons, 8 neutrons)&lt;ref&gt;Not a typical example as it results in a "doubly magic" nucleus&lt;/ref&gt; within a few seconds of being created. In this decay a neutron in the nitrogen nucleus is converted by the [[weak interaction]] into a proton, an electron and an [[antineutrino]]. The element is transmuted to another element, with a different number of protons.

In [[alpha decay]] (which typically occurs in the heaviest nuclei) the radioactive element decays by emitting a helium nucleus (2 protons and 2 neutrons), giving another element, plus helium-4. In many cases this process continues through several steps of this kind, including other types of decays (usually beta decay) until a stable element is formed.

In [[gamma decay]], a nucleus decays from an excited state into a lower energy state, by emitting a [[gamma ray]]. The element is not changed to another element in the process (no [[nuclear transmutation]] is involved).

Other more exotic decays are possible (see the first main article). For example, in [[internal conversion]] decay, the energy from an excited nucleus may eject one of the inner orbital electrons from the atom, in a process which produces high speed electrons, but is not [[beta decay]], and (unlike beta decay) does not transmute one element to another.

===Nuclear fusion===
In [[nuclear fusion]], two low mass nuclei come into very close contact with each other, so that the strong force fuses them. It requires a large amount of energy for the strong or [[nuclear force]]s to overcome the electrical repulsion between the nuclei in order to fuse them; therefore nuclear fusion can only take place at very high temperatures or high pressures. When nuclei fuse, a very large amount of energy is released and the combined nucleus assumes a lower energy level. The binding energy per nucleon increases with mass number up to [[nickel]]-62. [[Star]]s like the Sun are powered by the fusion of four protons into a helium nucleus, two [[positron]]s, and two [[neutrinos]]. The uncontrolled fusion of hydrogen into helium is known as thermonuclear runaway. A frontier in current research at various institutions, for example the [[Joint European Torus]] (JET) and [[ITER]], is the development of an economically viable method of using energy from a controlled fusion reaction.
Nuclear fusion is the origin of the energy (including in the form of light and other electromagnetic radiation) produced by the core of all stars including our own Sun.

===Nuclear fission===
[[Nuclear fission]] is the reverse process to fusion. For nuclei heavier than nickel-62 the binding energy per nucleon decreases with the mass number. It is therefore possible for energy to be released if a heavy nucleus breaks apart into two lighter ones.

The process of [[alpha decay]] is in essence a special type of spontaneous [[nuclear fission]]. It is a highly asymmetrical fission because the four particles which make up the alpha particle are especially tightly bound to each other, making production of this nucleus in fission particularly likely.

From certain of the heaviest nuclei whose fission produces free neutrons, and which also easily absorb neutrons to initiate fission, a self-igniting type of neutron-initiated fission can be obtained, in a [[chain reaction]]. Chain reactions were known in chemistry before physics, and in fact many familiar processes like fires and chemical explosions are chemical chain reactions. The fission or [[Nuclear chain reaction|"nuclear" chain-reaction]], using fission-produced neutrons, is the source of energy for [[nuclear power]] plants and fission type nuclear bombs, such as those detonated in [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], Japan, at the end of [[World War II]]. Heavy nuclei such as [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] may also undergo [[spontaneous fission]], but they are much more likely to undergo decay by alpha decay.

For a neutron-initiated chain reaction to occur, there must be a [[critical mass]] of the relevant isotope present in a certain space under certain conditions. The conditions for the smallest critical mass require the conservation of the emitted neutrons and also their slowing or [[neutron moderator|moderation]] so that there is a greater [[Neutron cross section|cross-section]] or probability of them initiating another fission.

=== Production of "heavy" elements (atomic number greater than five) ===
{{main|nucleosynthesis}}
According to the theory, as the Universe cooled after the [[Big Bang]] it eventually became possible for common subatomic particles as we know them (neutrons, protons and electrons) to exist. The most common particles created in the Big Bang which are still easily observable to us today were protons and electrons (in equal numbers). The protons would eventually form hydrogen atoms. Almost all the neutrons created in the Big Bang were absorbed into [[helium-4]] in the first three minutes after the Big Bang, and this helium accounts for most of the helium in the universe today (see [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]).

Some relatively small quantities of elements beyond helium (lithium, beryllium, and perhaps some boron) were created in the Big Bang, as the protons and neutrons collided with each other, but all of the "heavier elements" (carbon, element number 6, and elements of greater [[atomic number]]) that we see today, were created inside stars during a series of fusion stages, such as the [[proton-proton chain]], the [[CNO cycle]] and the [[triple-alpha process]]. Progressively heavier elements are created during the [[stellar evolution|evolution]] of a star.

Since the binding energy per [[nucleon]] peaks around iron (56 nucleons), energy is only released in fusion processes involving smaller atoms than that. Since the creation of heavier nuclei by fusion requires energy, nature resorts to the process of neutron capture. Neutrons (due to their lack of charge) are readily absorbed by a nucleus. The heavy elements are created by either a ''slow'' neutron capture process (the so-called ''s'' process) or the ''rapid'', or ''r'' process. The ''s'' process occurs in thermally pulsing stars (called AGB, or asymptotic giant branch stars) and takes hundreds to thousands of years to reach the heaviest elements of lead and bismuth. The ''r'' process is thought to occur in [[supernova explosions]] which provide the necessary conditions of high temperature, high neutron flux and ejected matter. These stellar conditions make the successive neutron captures very fast, involving very neutron-rich species which then beta-decay to heavier elements, especially at the so-called waiting points that correspond to more stable nuclides with closed neutron shells (magic numbers).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1863">The '''Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans''' ('''PISCO''') is a long-term [[ecosystem]] research and monitoring program, studying marine communities along the west coast of [[North America]].

Activities are conducted at the [[latitudinal]] scale of the [[California Current]] Large Marine Ecosystem along the west coast of North America, anchored around the dynamics of hard-bottom habitats such as [[kelp forests]] and [[Intertidal|rocky shores]] and the [[oceanography]] of the [[Littoral zone|nearshore]] ocean. The program studies changes in the ocean environment through both [[environmental monitoring]] and experiments, examining the causes and consequences of ecosystem changes over spatial scales that are the most relevant to marine species and management, but largely unstudied elsewhere.

Core elements of the program include the following:
* [[Ecosystem ecology|Interdisciplinary ecosystem science]]
* Data archiving and sharing&lt;ref&gt;http://www.piscoweb.org/data&lt;/ref&gt;
* Outreach to public and decision‐making user groups&lt;ref&gt;http://www.piscoweb.org/publications&lt;/ref&gt;
* Interdisciplinary training&lt;ref&gt;http://www.piscoweb.org/education&lt;/ref&gt;
* Coordination of a distributed research team

== History ==
The program was established in 1999 with funding from the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]], and is led by scientists from [[Oregon State University]]; [[Stanford University]]'s [[Hopkins Marine Station]]; [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (UCSC); and [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB). As of 2005, core PISCO activities were funded by collaborative grants from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]].

'''Physical geography''' (also known as '''geosystems''' or '''physiography''') is one of the two major sub-fields of [[geography]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/1b.html Fundamentals of Physical Geography, 2nd Edition, by M. Pidwirny, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physical Geography|first1=Michael |last1=Pidwirny |first2=Scott |last2=Jones|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net|year=1999–2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Physical Geography: Great Systems and Global Environments |first1=William M. |last1=Marsh |first2=Martin M.|last2=Kaufman |publisher=Cambridege University Press |year=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=uF3aJSC20yMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=physical+geography+system#v=onepage&amp;q=physical%20geography%20system&amp;f=false|isbn=9780521764285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical geography is that branch of [[natural science]] which deals with the study of processes and patterns in the [[natural environment]] like the [[atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[biosphere]], and [[geosphere]], as opposed to the cultural or [[built environment]], the domain of [[human geography]].

==Sub-branches==
[[Image:Delicate Arch LaSalle.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A [[natural arch]].]]
Physical Geography can be divided into several sub-fields, as follows:

* '''[[Geomorphology]]''' is the field concerned with understanding the [[lithosphere|surface]] of the Earth and the processes by which it is shaped, both at the present as well as in the past. Geomorphology as a field has several sub-fields that deal with the specific landforms of various environments e.g. [[desert]] geomorphology and [[fluvial]] geomorphology; however, these sub-fields are united by the core processes which cause them, mainly tectonic or climatic processes. Geomorphology seeks to understand [[landform]] history and dynamics, and predict future changes through a combination of field observation, physical experiment, and numerical modeling ([[Geomorphometry]]). Early studies in geomorphology are the foundation for pedology, one of two main branches of [[soil science]]

[[Image:Meander-en.svg|thumb|right|100px|[[Meander]] formation.]]

* '''[[Hydrology]]''' is predominantly concerned with the amounts and quality of water moving and accumulating on the land surface and in the soils and rocks near the surface and is typified by the [[hydrological cycle]]. Thus the field encompasses water in [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, [[aquifer]]s and to an extent [[glacier]]s, in which the field examines the process and dynamics involved in these bodies of water. Hydrology has historically had an important connection with [[engineering]] and has thus developed a largely quantitative method in its research; however, it does have an [[earth science]] side that embraces the systems approach. Similar to most fields of physical geography it has sub-fields that examine the specific bodies of water or their interaction with other  spheres e.g. [[limnology]] and [[ecohydrology]].
*'''[[Glaciology]]''' is the study of [[glacier]]s and [[ice sheets]], or more commonly the [[cryosphere]] or [[ice]] and phenomena that involve ice. Glaciology groups the latter (ice sheets) as continental glaciers and the former (glaciers) as alpine glaciers. Although  research in the areas are similar with research undertaken into both the dynamics of ice sheets and glaciers, the former tends to be concerned with the interaction of ice sheets with the present climate and the latter with the impact of glaciers on the landscape. Glaciology also has a vast array of sub-fields examining the factors and processes involved in ice sheets and glaciers e.g. [[snow]] hydrology and [[glacial geology]].
* '''[[Biogeography]]''' is the science which deals with geographic patterns of species distribution and the processes that result in these patterns. Biogeography emerged as a field of study as a result of the work of [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], although the field prior to the late twentieth century had largely been viewed as historic in its outlook and descriptive in its approach. The main stimulus for the field since its founding has been that of [[evolution]], [[plate tectonics]] and the theory of island biogeography. The field can largely be divided into five sub-fields: [[island biogeography]], paleobiogeography, [[phylogeography]], [[zoogeography]] and [[phytogeography]]
* '''[[Climatology]]''' is the study of the [[climate]], scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a long period of time. Climatology examines both the nature of micro (local) and macro (global) climates and the natural and [[wiktionary:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]] influences on them. The field is also sub-divided largely into the climates of various regions and the study of specific phenomena or time periods e.g. [[tropical cyclone rainfall climatology]] and [[paleoclimatology]].
* '''[[Meteorology]]''' is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the atmosphere that focuses on weather processes and short term forecasting (in contrast with climatology). Studies in the field stretch back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the eighteenth century. Meteorological phenomena are observable weather events which illuminate and are explained by the science of meteorology.
* '''[[Pedology (soil study)|Pedology]]''' is the study of soils in their natural environment. It is one of two main branches of [[soil science]], the other being [[edaphology]]. Pedology mainly deals with [[pedogenesis]], [[soil morphology]], [[soil classification]]. In physical geography pedology is largely studied due to the numerous interactions between climate (water, air, temperature), soil life (micro-organisms, plants, animals), the mineral materials within soils ([[biogeochemical cycles]]) and its position and effects on the landscape such as [[Tropical rainforest#Characteristics|lateralization]].
* '''[[Palaeogeography]]''' is a cross-disciplinary study that examines the preserved material in the stratigraphic record to determine the distribution of the continents through geologic time.  Almost all the evidence for the positions of the continents comes from [[geology]] in the form of [[fossil]]s or [[paleomagnetism]].  The use of this data has resulted in evidence for [[continental drift]], [[plate tectonics]], and [[supercontinents]].  This, in turn, has supported palaeogeographic theories such as the [[Wilson cycle]].
* '''[[Coastal geography]]''' is the study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology, and oceanography) and the human geography of the coast. It involves an understanding of coastal [[weathering]] processes, particularly wave action, sediment movement and weathering, and also the ways in which humans interact with the coast. Coastal geography, although predominantly geomorphological in its research, is not just concerned with coastal landforms, but also the causes and influences of [[sea level change]].
* '''[[Oceanography]]''' is the branch of physical geography that studies the Earth's oceans and seas. It covers a wide range of topics, including marine organisms and ecosystem dynamics ([[biological oceanography]]); ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics ([[physical oceanography]]); plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor ([[geological oceanography]]); and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries ([[chemical oceanography]]). These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within it.
* '''[[Quaternary science]]''' is an inter-disciplinary field of study focusing on the [[Quaternary]] period, which encompasses the last 2.6 million years. The field studies the last ice age and the recent [[interstadial]] the [[Holocene]] and uses proxy evidence to reconstruct the past environments during this period to infer the climatic and environmental changes that have occurred.
* '''[[Landscape ecology]]''' is a sub-discipline of [[ecology]] and geography that address how spatial variation in the landscape affects ecological processes such as the distribution and flow of energy, materials and individuals in the environment (which, in turn, may influence the distribution of landscape "elements" themselves such as hedgerows). The field was largely founded by the German geographer [[Carl Troll]]. Landscape ecology typically deals with problems in an applied and holistic context. The main difference between biogeography and landscape ecology is that the latter is concerned with how flows or energy and material are changed and their impacts on the landscape whereas the former is concerned with the spatial patterns of species and chemical cycles.
* '''[[Geomatics]]''' is the field of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information, or spatially referenced information.  Geomatics includes geodesy (scientific discipline that deals with the measurement and representation of the earth, its gravitational field, and other geodynamic phenomena, such as crustal motion, oceanic tides, and polar motion), [[Geographic information science|geographical information science (GIS)]] and [[remote sensing]] (the short or large-scale acquisition of information of an object or phenomenon, by the use of either recording or real-time sensing devices that are not in physical or intimate contact with the object).
* '''[[Environmental geography]]''' is a branch of geography that analyzes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world. The branch bridges the divide between human and physical geography and thus requires an understanding of the dynamics of geology, meteorology, hydrology, biogeography, and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment. Although the branch was previously more visible in research than at present with theories such as [[environmental determinism]] linking society with the environment. It has largely become the domain of the study of environmental management or anthropogenic influences.

==Journals and literature==
Physical geography and earth science journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions. Most journals cover a specific field and publish the research within that field, however unlike human geographers, physical geographers tend to publish in inter-disciplinary journals rather than predominantly geography journal; the research is normally expressed in the form of a [[scientific paper]]. Additionally, textbooks, books, and magazines on geography communicate research to laypeople, although these tend to focus on [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]] or cultural dilemmas. Examples of journals that publish articles from physical geographers are:

==Historical evolution of the discipline==
{{cleanup|section|date=November 2009}}
From the birth of geography as a science during the Greek classical period and until the late nineteenth century with the birth of [[anthropogeography]] (human geography), geography was almost exclusively a natural science: the study of location and descriptive gazetteer of all places of the known world. Several works among the best known during this long period could be cited as an example, from [[Strabo]] (''Geography''), [[Eratosthenes]] (''Geographika'') or Dionisio Periegetes (''Periegesis Oiceumene'') in the Ancient Age to the [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (''Kosmos'') in the nineteenth century, in which geography is regarded as a physical and natural science, of course, through the work ''Summa de Geografía'' of [[Martín Fernández de Enciso]] from the early sixteenth century, which indicated for the first time the New World.

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a controversy exported from geology, between supporters of [[James Hutton]] (uniformitarianism thesis) and [[Georges Cuvier]] (catastrophism) strongly influenced the field of geography, because geography at this time was a natural science since Human Geography or Anthropogeography had just developed as a discipline in the late nineteenth century.

Two historical events during the nineteenth century had a great effect in the further development of physical geography. The first was the European colonial expansion in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]] and even [[United States|America]] in search of raw materials required by industries during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This fostered the creation of geography departments in the universities of the colonial powers and the birth and development of national geographical societies, thus giving rise to the process identified by Horacio Capel as the institutionalization of geography.

One of the most prolific empires in this regard was Russia. In the mid-eighteenth century many geographers were sent by the Russian altamirazgo different opportunities to perform geographical surveys in the area of Arctic [[Siberia]]. Among these is who is considered the patriarch of Russian geography, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]]. In the mid-1750s Lomonosov began working in the Department of Geography, Academy of Sciences to conduct research in Siberia, their contributions are notable in this regard, showing the soil organic origin and developing a comprehensive law on the movement of the ice that still governs the basics, thereby founding a new branch of geography: glaciology. In 1755 his initiative was founded [[Moscow University]] where he promotes the study of geography and the training of geographers. In 1758 he was appointed director of the Department of Geography, Academy of Sciences, a post from which would develop a working methodology for geographical survey guided by the most important long expeditions and geographical studies in Russia. Thus followed the line of Lomonosov and the contributions of the Russian school became more frequent through his disciples, and in the nineteenth century we have great geographers as [[Vasily Dokuchaev]] who performed works of great importance as a "principle of comprehensive analysis of the territory" and "Russian Chernozem" latter being the most important where introduces the geographical concept of soil, as distinct from a simple geological strata, and thus founding a new geographic area of study: pedology. Climatology also receive a strong boost from the Russian school by [[Wladimir Köppen]] whose main contribution, climate classification, is still valid today. However, this great geographer also contributed to the paleogeography through his work "The climates of the geological past" which is considered the father of [[paleoclimatology]]. Russian geographers who made great contributions to the discipline in this period were: [[NM Sibirtsev]], [[Pyotr Semyonov]], [[Konstantin Glinka|K.D. Glinka]], [[Neustrayev]], among others.

The second important process is the theory of evolution by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] in mid-century (which decisively influenced the work of [[Ratzel]], who had academic training as a zoologist and was a follower of Darwin's ideas) which meant an important impetus in the development of Biogeography.

Another major event in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries will give a major boost to development of geography and will take place in the [[United States]]. It is the work of the famous geographer [[William Morris Davis]] who not only made important contributions to the establishment of discipline in his country, but revolutionized the field to develop [[geographical cycle]] theory which he proposed as a paradigm for geography in general, although in actually served as a paradigm for physical geography. His theory explained that mountains and other landforms are shaped by the influence of a number of factors that are manifested in the geographical cycle. He explained that the cycle begins with the lifting of the relief by geological processes (faults, volcanism, tectonic upheaval, etc.). Geographical factors such as rivers and runoff begins to create the V-shaped valleys between the mountains (the stage called "youth"). During this first stage, the terrain is steeper and more irregular. Over time, the currents can carve wider valleys ("maturity") and then start to wind, towering hills only ("senescence"). Finally, everything comes to what is a plain flat plain at the lowest elevation possible (called "baseline") This plain was called by Davis' "peneplain" meaning "almost plain" Then the rejuvenation occurs and there is another mountain lift and the cycle continues. Although Davis's theory is not entirely accurate, it was absolutely revolutionary and unique in its time and helped to modernize and create geography subfield of geomorphology. Its implications prompted a myriad of research in various branches of physical geography. In the case of the Paleogeography this theory provided a model for understanding the evolution of the landscape. For hydrology, glaciology, and climatology as a boost investigated as studying geographic factors shape the landscape and affect the cycle. The bulk of the work of William Morris Davis led to the development of a new branch of physical geography: Geomorphology whose contents until then did not differ from the rest of geography. Shortly after this branch would present a major development. Some of his disciples made significant contributions to various branches of physical geography such as [[Curtis Marbut]] and his invaluable legacy for Pedology, [[Mark Jefferson (geographer)|Mark Jefferson]], [[Isaiah Bowman]], among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29000">'''Precycling''' is the practice of [[waste reduction|reducing waste]] by attempting to avoid bringing items which will generate [[waste]] into home or business. The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) also cites that precycling is the preferred method of integrated [[solid waste management]] because it cuts waste at its source and therefore trash is eliminated before it is created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|pages=1382–1390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the EPA, precycling is also characterized as a decision-making process on the behalf of the consumer because it involves making informed judgments regarding a product’s waste implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Leary|first1=Philip R|last2=Walsh|first2=Patrick W|title=Source Reduction: Final Report|journal=Decision Maker's Guide to Solid Waste Management|date=1999|volume=2|page=5|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/dmg2/chapter5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implications that are taken into consideration by the consumer include: whether a product is [[Reuse|reusable]], [[durable]], or [[repairable]]; made from renewable or [[non-renewable resource]]s; [[over-packaged]]; and whether or not the container is reusable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Leary|first1=Philip R|last2=Walsh|first2=Patrick W|title=Source Reduction: Final Report|journal=Decision Maker's Guide to Solid Waste Management|date=1999|volume=2|page=6|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/dmg2/chapter5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
Precycling has the ability to build industrial, social, environmental, and economic circumstances that allow for old products to be converted into new resources &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1385}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Industrial: increasing the independence from accumulative substances, such as heavy metals, fossil fuels, synthetics, etc.
*Economic: create a [[circular economy]]
*Ecological/environmental: allowance for more extensive and diverse [[natural habitat]]s where the resources are returned to nature
*Societal: extend the capacity of precycling to meet everyone’s needs
The concept of ‘precycling’ was coined in 1988 by [[social marketing]] executive Maureen O’Rorke in a public waste education campaign for the City of Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=DiChristina|first1=Mariette|title=How We Can Win The War Against Garbage|magazine=Popular Science|year=1990|volume=237|issue=4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The application of precycling is not limited to large corporations, but can be administered on smaller scales in local communities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The reason precycling is effective on large scales and on small scales stems from the idea that it shares a common language between experts and non-experts, buyers and sellers, economists and environmentalists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, it is important to consider that waste prevention systems, such as precycling, require the collaborative effort from several working parts.  These parts include prevention targets, producer responsibility, householder charging, funding for pilot projects, public involvement, engagement of private and third sectors, and public campaigns that spread awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|pages=193–219|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration of waste management==
The original three-pronged push for [[waste management]] is "[[Reduce, Reuse, Recycle]]." Precycling emphasizes "reducing and reusing", while harnessing and questioning the momentum and popularity of the term "recycle." In addition to this strategy, precycling incorporates four supplementary R’s: [[Repair]], Recondition, [[Remanufacturing|Remanufacture]] and Refuse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|pages=257–267|url= http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/5495/ |doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste is a resource that can be reused, recycled, recovered, or treated.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1646|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precycling differs from other singular forms of waste prevention because it encompasses not one behavior, but many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=212|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reduce===
Reduce is a form of precycling that allows for the preservation of [[natural resources]] and also saves money on behalf of the manufacturer, the consumer, and the waste manager.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, effective source reduction slows the [[resource depletion|depletion of environmental resources]], prolongs the life of waste management facilities, and makes combustion and [[landfill]]s safer by removing [[toxic waste]] components.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Reuse===
[[Reuse]] is a form of precycling that reinvents items after their initial life and avoids creating additional waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bushnell|first1=Kristen|last2=Harpster|first2=Amy|last3=Simchuk|first3=Sarah|last4=Manckia|first4=Jen|last5=Stevens|first5=Cathy|title=Reduce, Reuse, Recycle|date=2009|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recycle===
Although precycling harnesses the familiarity of the term recycling, it is still important to note the difference between recycling and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=195|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since precycling focuses on the prevention of waste production, this entails that measures are taken before a substance, material, or product has become waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=195|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas recycling is a type of precycling that involves taking action before existing waste is abandoned to nature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Recycling is a process where discarded materials are collected, sorted, processed, and used in the production of new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=263|url=http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/5495/|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every time a person engages in the act of recycling, they help increase the market and bring the cost down.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"/&gt; However, current research from the American Plastics Council states that only 25% of the nation’s recycling capabilities are being utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krug|first1=Donna|last2=County Agency|first2=Barton|title=It's Easy to be Green|date=2009|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally [[recycling]] requires large amounts of energy to "melt down" and then re-manufacture items. While this may cut down on the amount of trash that is going into [[landfill]]s, it is not sustainable unless the underlying energy supply is sustainable. In addition, recycling often means [[downcycling]] and always involves at least some loss of the original material, so primary extraction is still required to make up the difference. Precycling reduces these problems by using less material in the first place, so less has to be recycled.

===Repairing===
[[Repair]] is a type of precycling that corrects specified faults in a product, however the quality of a repaired product is inferior to reconditioned or remanufactured items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=260|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; One survey found that 68% of the respondents believed repairing was not cost efficient and sought alternative methods such as reconditioning or remanufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=260|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconditioning===
[[Reconditioning]] is a type of precycling that requires the rebuilding of major components to restore a product’s working condition, which is expected to be inferior to the original product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remanufacturing===
[[Remanufacturing]] is another type of precycling that involves the greatest degree of work content, which results in superior quality of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to remanufacture a product, it requires a total dismantling of the product and the subsequent restoration and replacement of its parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remanufacturing is a preferred method of waste reduction compared to repairing and reconditioning because it preserves the [[embodied energy]] that has been used to shape the components of a product for their first life and it only requires 20-25% of the initial energy used in formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refuse===
Refusal to buy certain products due to detrimental impacts on the environment or wasteful packaging is another type of precycling because the rejection of such items paves the way for products that can be reduced, reused, or recycled.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"/&gt;

==Zero-waste strategy==
A [[zero waste]] approach aims to prevent rather than just reduce accumulated waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curbside Cleanup|first1=Day|title=Garbage &amp; Recycling|journal=Earth 7|date=2012|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zero-waste goes beyond recycling to include the whole system, which includes the flow of resources and waste through human society.&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"/&gt; This “design principle” works to maximize recycling, minimize waste, reduce consumption and ensures that products are reused, repaired or recycled back into nature or the market.&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"/&gt; This preventative approach is more manageable and effective than incremental approaches that focus on gradually reducing the amount of impact because it is less complex and contains less information, which permits wider public participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
In regards to sustainability, the term itself is often associated with resource constraints and maintenance of the status quo rather than growth and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1649|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the implementation of a zero-waste management strategy, sustainable practices can push the status quo in order to create a society that is capable of development, technically and culturally advanced, dynamic in population and production, thoughtful with the use of non-renewable resources, and diverse, democratic, and challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1649|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic effects===
Increased waste production is often negatively associated with increased [[economic growth]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; However, a zero-waste management strategy allows for economic growth that works cohesively with sustainability rather than against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of a zero-waste strategy is part of an economic goal-set that aims to create a circular economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1383}}&lt;/ref&gt; A circular economy refers to a closed-loop socio-economic system that focuses on minimizing wastes while simultaneously maximizing stocks of resources for the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1384}}&lt;/ref&gt; This closed-loop design diverts linear (open-loop) waste disposal streams into new raw material streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=259|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a circular economy, one way to minimize waste is through the employment of precycling insurance, which allows for a full range of financed waste prevention opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of insurance would set premiums related to the risk of a product ending up as waste, and these premiums would serve to fund actions concerning waste prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; When establishing a premium for precycling insurance several factors need to calculated: recyclability or biodegradability; provision of infrastructure, habitat or collaborations for the generation of the product from new resources; the ecosystem concentrations of product components above natural levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of precycling insurance is plausible considering the aim of insurance industries is to avoid losses rather than paying for losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order for this idea to work, private and third sectors need to be involved and engaged in the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, a third sector refers to small charities and a handful of societal enterprises that coordinate with charity shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=204|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the “Extended Producer Responsibility” principle,  impacts are substantially determined at the point of design where key decisions are made on materials, production process, and how products are used and disposed of at the end of life-cycle, which falls on the producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=258|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a circular economy there is the recognition that nature’s capacity needs to be maximized through the reprocess of biodegradable wastes produced by industries and human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task is accomplished through the procurement and funding of precycling insurance premiums that invest in systematic preservation of endangered habitats, careful harvesting of biological resources and expansions of productive ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in terms of climate change, precycling insurance offers a flexible alternative to the binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions and international taxation on mineral fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[waste management]] systems, the environment benefits from the reparation of products to the greatest degree because less energy is required and the majority of the original material is kept intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=265|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Societal effects===
The social structure operating under a circular economy is referred to as a circular society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of a circular society is to create a cooperative culture by means of problem-prevention, resource-availability and fuller participation, with reference to precycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One critique of this approach, in terms of waste management, is that it is difficult to maintain a cooperative culture within a society because it is constantly evolving and changing.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"/&gt;

==Raising awareness==
There is an increasing [[public awareness]] on the need for [[sustainable production]] and consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopewell|first1=Jefferson|last2=Dvorak|first2=Robert|last3=Kosior|first3=Edward|title=Plastics recycling: challenges and opportunities|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2009|volume=364|issue=1526|page=2124|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0311|pmid=19528059|pmc=2873020}}&lt;/ref&gt; One campaign that aimed at raising awareness of precycling focused on whether people’s self-reported behaviors were affected by exposure to precycling advertisements on the radio, television, or in-store flyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=12|doi=10.1080/00958964.1996.9942810}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that the most effective results stemmed from the inclusion of social rewards that invoke an intrinsic motivation to engage in precycling behaviors.&lt;ref name=gillian&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=16|doi=10.1080/00958964.1996.9942810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to raise awareness is through statistics that highlight the potential impacts that can be achieved through waste prevention. For instance, if 70 million Americans bought a half-gallon [[plastic-coated carton]] container of milk each week (instead of two quarts), then 41.6 million pounds of paper discards and 5.7 pounds of plastic discards would be reduced annually.  This transition from two quarts to a half-gallon would save $145.6 million on packaging each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
In order to effectively implement precycling practices and behaviors, the public needs to feel "enabled", "engaged", "encouraged", and "exemplified" in their efforts to partake in precycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=196|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only can the average consumer practice precycling, but industries can also participate. Purchasing from parts suppliers, reuse of chemicals, and reduction of unnecessary packaging are some methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Precycling|work=Environmental Encyclopedia|publisher=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some companies and countries that have taken it upon themselves to implement more sustainable practices that align with precycling principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1647|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Fonterra]] reduced its packaging through the implementation of bulking, reuse and redesign.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"/&gt; Further, [[Waste in New Zealand|Waste Management New Zealand]] created Recycle New Zealand, which provided a subsidiary focusing on the collection of materials that could be diverted and sorted prior to the operations of reducing, recycling, or recovering.  Moving forward, free-trade organizations can further implement precycling practices by exploring this strategy as a new way to reduce regulations and to promote greater industrial freedom of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the individual consumer can develop precycling habits by engaging in the following practices and behaviors:

==="Enviro-shopping"===
Enviro-shopping is considered shopping with the environment and implements a precycling strategy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Bringing one's own grocery bag or bring old ones back to the store 
*Buying packages with the least amount of packaging 
*Buying in bulk, but not buying more than one will use
*Looking for products with reusable dishes

===Product selection===
Products to choose from in accordance with precycling principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curbside Cleanup|first1=Day|title=Garbage &amp; Recycling|journal=Earth 7|date=2012|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Plastic milk jugs or glass milk containers (no cartons)
*Fresh fruit and vegetables
*Concentrated products that involves less packaging
*Recycled products
*[[Rechargeable battery|Rechargeable batteries]]

===Behaviors===
In addition to shopping practices that implement precycling principles, there are also behaviors that can be undertaken to prevent waste:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=200|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Home [[compost]]ing
*Avoid [[Advertising mail|junk mail]]
*Buy [[used good|second-hand]]
*One way to participate in precycling is to carry a "precycling kit". Include a [[Tupperware]] or non-[[disposable]] container, [[silver (household)|silverware]] set, a [[napkin|cloth napkin]] or [[handkerchief]], and a [[thermos]] or water-bottle within a [[cloth]] bag that can double as a [[grocery bag|grocery/shopping bag]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4235">'''Rata Die''' ('''R.D.''') is a system for assigning numbers to calendar days (optionally with time of day), independent of any calendar, for the purposes of [[calendrical calculation]]s. It was named (after the [[Latin]] [[Ablative#Latin|ablative]] feminine singular for "from a [[wikt:rata#Latin|fixed]] [[wikt:dies#Latin|date]]") by Howard Jacobson.&lt;ref name="the_book" /&gt; The same system (including the same epoch) was used earlier, e.g., the [[REXX]] programming language since about 1980:&lt;ref&gt;[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r3/topic/books/sc415729.pdf REXX/400 Reference manual] page 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote cite="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r3/topic/books/sc415729.pdf"&gt;
The base date of 1 January 0001 is determined by extending the current Gregorian calendar backward (365 days each year, with an extra day every year that is divisible by 4 except century years that are not divisible by 400).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rata Die is somewhat similar to [[Julian Date]]s (JD), in that the values are plain [[real number]]s that increase by 1 each day.
The systems differ principally in that JD takes on a particular value at a particular absolute time, and is the same in all contexts, whereas R.D. values may be relative to [[timezone]], depending on the implementation.  This makes R.D. more suitable for work on calendar dates, whereas JD is more suitable for work on time per se. The systems also differ trivially by having different epochs: R.D. is 1 at midnight (00:00) local time on January 1, AD 1 in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]], JD is 0 at noon (12:00) [[Universal Time]] on January 1, 4713 BC in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]], and the [[REXX]] count of days begins with 0 at midnight (00:00) local time on January 1, AD 1 in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.

==Forms==
===Dershowitz and Reingold===
There are three distinct forms of R.D.  In this section they will each be defined in terms of Julian Dates.

The first form of R.D. is a continuously-increasing fractional number, taking integer values at midnight local time.  It may be defined in terms of the Julian Date as
:RD = JD &amp;minus; 1&amp;#x202F;721&amp;#x202F;424.5

In the second form, R.D. is an integer that labels an entire day, from midnight to midnight local time.  This is the result of rounding the first form of R.D. downwards (towards negative infinity).  It is the same as the relation between Julian Date and Julian Day Number (JDN).  Thus:
:RD = floor( JD &amp;minus; 1&amp;#x202F;721&amp;#x202F;424.5 )

In the third form, the R.D. is an integer labelling noon time, and incapable of labelling any other time of day. This is defined as
:RD = JD &amp;minus; 1&amp;#x202F;721&amp;#x202F;425
where the R.D. value must be an integer, thus constraining the choice of JD. This form of R.D. is used in the book for conversion of calendar dates between calendars that separate days on different boundaries.

The book does not explicitly distinguish between these three forms, using the abbreviation "R.D." for all of them.&lt;ref name="the_book"&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=0-521-70238-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book does not say that the RD is based on Greenwich time, but page&amp;nbsp;10 states that an R.D. with a decimal fraction is called a moment, and the function '''moment-from-jd''' takes a floating point number as an argument and returns the argument minus 1721424.5&amp;#x202F;; there is no requirement or opportunity to supply a time zone offset as an argument.

===REXX===
The DATE function of the REXX computer language can return the number of complete days (that is, not including the current day) since and including the base date, 1 January AD 1 Gregorian, if the "Base" option is specified. This function uses local, not Greenwich, time. REXX does not use the name "Rata Die".

'''Refund to Savings''' (R2S) is an innovative, rigorously designed and scalable program intended to help low-income households build savings and increase financial security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csd.wustl.edu/AssetBuilding/Pages/Refund-to-savings.aspx Refund to Savings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204204502/http://csd.wustl.edu/AssetBuilding/Pages/Refund-to-savings.aspx |date=2013-02-04 }}. Center for Social Development, Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of a collaboration between the [[Center for Social Development]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], [[Duke University]], and [[Intuit|Intuit Inc]]. R2S is the largest savings experiment conducted in the United States to date. This initiative builds on Intuit’s [[TurboTax]] Free File Alliance Online product, available free to lower-income taxpayers, to reach thousands of households.

The goal of the initiative is to design and test a low-touch, scalable intervention that can transform the tax-refund windfall into savings to improve financial security. The intervention builds on existing infrastructure and integrates with normal financial behavior, so it can quickly and inexpensively be expanded to reach millions of American households.

==Key Researchers and Partners==

The experiment was developed by economics professors [[Michal Grinstein-Weiss]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and  [[Dan Ariely]] at [[Duke University]] and uses [[Intuit Inc|Intuit's]] TurboTax tax preparation software.

==Background==

The moment people are notified about their tax refund is a golden opportunity to divert money into short- and long-term savings. The participant just learned they will be receiving money, the money feels like a windfall (outside of their normal income pattern) and they do not yet have the money in hand.

The R2S initiative capitalizes on this opportunity. The R2S initiative is designed to help us better understand the exact mechanisms that would convince individuals to divert money to savings and debt clearing at this golden moment. For example, would mentioning the names of the taxpayer’s children increases the desire to divert money? Or would providing taxpayers a sense 
of common behavior among their peers motivate increased debt clearing?

The R2S initiative is designed to help us better understand the exact mechanisms that would convince individuals to divert money to savings and debt clearing at this golden moment. The prompts are informed by behavioral economics principles and have been shown in prior research to significantly increase savings intention in lower-income taxpayers. The variation in the prompts tests the influence of particular motivations on financial decision-making, compared with an unprompted control group. The variation in defaults tests the effect of defaults and of anchoring on savings behavior.

==Research Agenda==

The R2S initiative involves collecting three streams of data to evaluate the impact of the intervention and inform the design of future innovations to build savings, including the Intention Survey, In-Product Saving Offer, and Household Financial Survey.

===Intention Survey===

The Intention Survey is cross-sectional and designed to elicit information about possible behaviors and responses to behavioral economics-inspired prompts. It also gauges ownership of financial products (e.g., checking account, savings bond) and interest in using or opening these products at tax time. Findings from the Intention Survey contributed to the development of the In-Product Saving Offer and the Household Financial Survey. In 2012, 4,087 Intuit customers responded to the Intention Survey.

===In-Product Saving Offer===
The In-Product Saving Offer is the largest saving experiment ever undertaken in the U.S. TurboTax Freedom Edition users with refunds are assigned randomly to a treatment condition or control group. The control group uses the regular TurboTax program. The treatment group uses a version of the program in which they receive a prompt and a saving opportunity designed to increase saving. Data generated by program use and refund allocation behavior will be evaluated to determine whether the prompts, saving opportunity, or both increased saving levels compared to the control groups. In 2012, 150,000 people were included in the study, and about 1 million tax filers are expected to be included in 2013.

===Household Financial Survey===
The Household Financial Survey (HFS) is a longitudinal cohort study designed to determine the impact of tax-time saving and examine the effects of supply (e.g., availability of and access to savings products) and demand (e.g., awareness of the need for [[precautionary savings]]) factors that may influence the use and impact of the intervention. HFS participants will be sampled from those randomized in the In-Product Saving Offer and surveyed immediately after tax filing and again six months later. The HFS will allow R2S researchers to understand the impact of saving on the financial lives of households by (a) describing the context in which people choose to save at tax time, (b) determining if savings initiated by the In-Product Offer are new (i.e., not money that would have been saved in the absence of the intervention), and (c) verifying whether the savings ultimately increase households’ financial security. In 2012, the HFS pilot included about 350 households, and the research team expects about 12,000 households to participate in the study in 2013.

==Impact==
Ultimately, R2S has numerous implications for ongoing policy discussions at state and federal levels. First, the findings will show whether (a) the use of behavioral economics-inspired interventions can increase saving at tax time and (b) saving-promotion efforts yield increased financial security and improved household balance sheets. Second, the project could provide evidence on the effect of supply- and demand-side constraints to saving and thus inform policy discussions regarding financial access, financial knowledge, and consumer protection. Third, the design and operation of the R2S initiative may be of interest to those considering policy innovations that leverage private-sector resources or incorporate public-private partnerships to achieve public policy objectives.

The team is also planning an ambitious program of dissemination to share R2S findings with a variety of audiences. Several policy, academic, and general interest publications will be produced detailing the impact of the experiment and findings from the research in each year. R2S also plans to host events to share interesting findings with the research and policy communities and with the general public.

Sir '''Robert Christison''', 1st Baronet, &lt;small&gt;[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[FRCSE]] [[FRCPE]]&lt;/small&gt; (18 July 1797 – 27 January 1882),&lt;ref&gt;National Probate Calendar, Index of Wills and Administrations&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[toxicologist]] and [[physician]] who served as president of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] (1838–40 and 1846-8) and as president of the [[British Medical Association]] (1875).&lt;ref name="Waterston"&gt;{{cite book

==Life==
Christison was born in [[Edinburgh]],&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Christison, Sir Robert|volume=6|pages=292–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Prof [[Alexander Christison]] [[FRSE]] (1753–1820).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/19th-december-1885/18/a-scotch-physicians-autobiography-the-late-sir-rob |title=A Scotch Physician’s Autobiography |journal=[[The Spectator]] |date=19 December 1885 |pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a twin, his elder brother (by a few minutes) being later Rev. Alexander Christison (1797–1874).&lt;ref&gt;Men of the Time Alaric A Watts&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]] before studying Medicine at [[University of Edinburgh]], graduating in 1819.

He then spent a short time in [[London]], studying under [[John Abernethy (surgeon)|John Abernethy]] and Sir [[Sir William Lawrence, 1st Baronet|William Lawrence]], and in [[Paris]], where he learnt [[analytical chemistry]] from [[Pierre Jean Robiquet|Pierre Robiquet]] and [[toxicology]] from [[Mathieu Orfila]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In 1822 he returned to Edinburgh as professor of medical [[jurisprudence]], and set to work to organise the study of his subject on a sound basis. On [[poison]]s in particular he speedily became a high authority; his well-known treatise on them was published in 1829, and in the course of his inquiries he did not hesitate to try such daring experiments on himself as taking large doses of [[Calabar bean]] ([[Physostigmine]]). In 1827, he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]], a position he held until 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=A. Logan|title=Story of a Great Hospital: The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh 1729–1929|date=1937|publisher=Oliver and Boyd|location=Edinburgh|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attainments in [[medical jurisprudence]] and toxicology procured him the appointment, in 1829, of medical officer to [[the crown]] in [[Scotland]], and from that time until 1866 he was called as a witness in many celebrated criminal cases.

In 1832, Christison gave up the chair of medical jurisprudence and accepted that of medicine and therapeutics, which he held until 1877; at the same time he became professor of clinical medicine, and continued in that capacity until 1855. At this time his address is listed as 3 Great Stuart Street on the Moray Estate, a very large Georgian townhouse in the west end of [[Edinburgh]], a highly desirable area.&lt;ref name="digital"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/directories/browse/pageturner.cfm?id=83400027&amp;mode=transcription|title=(72) - Scottish Post Office Directories &amp;gt; Towns &amp;gt; Edinburgh &amp;gt; 1805-1834 - Post Office annual directory &amp;gt; 1832-1833 - Scottish Directories|website=National Library of Scotland|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chairman of a Committee of the General Medical Council he was responsible for the compilation of the first ''[[Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia|Pharmacopoeia of Great Britain and Ireland]]''. In 1842 he published his ''Dispensatory'', a commentary on the Pharmacopoeia. By his laboratory research, by his writings, by his collections of botanical specimens, Professor Christison became recognised as a world authority on therapeutics, on the manufacture of drugs, and on their presentation to patients.

His fame as a toxicologist and medical jurist, together with his work on the [[pathology]] of the [[kidney]]s and on [[fever]]s, secured him a large private practice, and he succeeded to a fair share of the honors that commonly attend the successful physician, being appointed physician to [[Queen Victoria]] in 1848 and receiving a [[baronet]]cy in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=23798 |date=21 November 1871 |page=4795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the books which he published were a treatise on ''Granular Degeneration of the Kidneys'' (1839), and a ''Commentary on the Pharmacopoeias of Great Britain'' (1842).

Christison was a strong opposer of women in the field of medicine, a view in Edinburgh eventually undermined by his colleague, [[Patrick Heron Watson]]'s admission of women students to his extra mural surgery classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=1033587 | pmid=5325874 | volume=10 | issue=2 | title=An Edinburgh surgeon of the Crimean war--Patrick Heron Watson (1832–1907) | year=1966 | journal=Med Hist | pages=166–76 | last1 = Watson | first1 = WB | doi=10.1017/s0025727300010954}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further (still controversial) proposal was his creation of a system of [[Lethal injection]] (through the discovery of [[Physostigmine]] in 1846) for human execution, in place of hanging. For various reasons, although this seems to pre-date its introduction into American use by 40 years, the method never appealed to British sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rcpe.ac.uk/sites/default/files/notable_fellow.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Christison served as Vice President of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] 1845–1868 and was its President from 1868 to 1873.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Robert Christison, who retained remarkable physical vigour and activity until extreme old age, died at Edinburgh on 27 January 1882. He is buried in [[New Calton Cemetery]] in a family plot created by his father, Alexander Christison (who is buried in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] and only memorialised here), on one of the south-facing terraces.

==Opposition to Women Doctors==
Sir Robert Christison was unequivocally opposed to the notion of women studying medicine and qualifying as doctors and led the campaign against [[Sophia Jex-Blake]] and the [[Edinburgh Seven]]. He was an influential figure both within the University and in the wider civic life of Edinburgh; his opinion was held in high regard.

When the Senatus met on 9 April 1870 to discuss the issue of [[Edith Pechey|Edith Pechey's]] right to a Hope Scholarship having come top of the class in the Chemistry exam, he made his opinions very clear.

He shared the view of many of his contemporaries that Nature intended women to be mothers and housekeepers, and lacked the intellectual ability and stamina of men. Consequently, if women were to enter any learned profession in significant numbers they would lower its standards.

His influence was largely responsible for the eventual decision taken by the University not to allow the women to graduate.

[[James Stansfeld]], who had been very closely associated with the London campaign (following the failure of the Edinburgh campaign) wrote, in his brief history of the events, in 1877:

″Dr Sophia Jex-Blake has made the greatest of all contributions to the end attained. I do not say that she has been the ultimate cause of success. The ultimate cause has been simply this, that the time was at hand. It is one of the lessons of the history of progress that when the time for reform has come you cannot resist it, though if you make the attempt, what you may do is to widen its character or precipitate its advent. Opponents, when the time has come, are not merely dragged at the chariot wheels of progress - they help to turn them. The strongest forces, whichever way it seems to work, does most to aid. The forces of greatest concentration here have been, in my view, on the one hand the Edinburgh University led by Sir Robert Christison, on the other the women claimants led by Dr Sophia Jex-Blake.″

==Family==

Christison's wife was Henrietta Sophia Brown (1799–1843).

Their children included Sir Alexander Christison, baronet and Dr David Christison MD LLD (1830-1912).

The '''Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies''' ("SCJS"), founded in August 1990 by Rabbi Joshua Stampfer of [[Portland, Oregon]], and Dr. Stanley Hordes of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], is the major academic organization conducting and encouraging research on the [[Crypto-Jews]]{{ref|1}} of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] and their descendants today. This also involves significant attention being given to the [[Inquisition]] and to its ramifications for [[Sephardic Jews]] as well as for the general [[Jewish]] community. 

Membership in the SCJS is composed of scholars interested in crypto-Jews, descendants of crypto-Jews, and others interested in the topic from a historical, sociological, anthropological, religious, ethnic, literary, philosophical, or other perspective. The Society is nonreligious, and membership is open to all. Today, there is much interest, both academic and personal, in the history and contemporary status of crypto-Jews, and a number of distinguished scholars have published in the area. Especially in recent years, a number of people, especially, but not limited to, [[Hispanics]], have returned or converted to Judaism, frequently in part because of knowledge of a previously-suppressed Jewish heritage. [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]], [[Arizona]], and [[California]] are major areas of interest, but significant interest also is found in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], [[Orlando, Florida]], [[New York City]], [[Portland, Oregon]], and other areas with large numbers of [[Hispanic]]s. This contemporary phenomenon of returning/converting also is of specific interest to some academic researchers.

The SCJS publishes ''HaLapid'': The Journal of the Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies, a combination newsletter and journal. Published four times per year, ''HaLapid'' (Hebrew for The Torch) mostly includes refereed academic research articles, personal stories by descendants of crypto-Jews, and news items, but also includes occasional poetry, links for related websites, and other items of interest. The SCJC also hosts a website, and helps answer questions and make referrals for interested persons.

The Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies meets annually for a three-day conference which includes a keynote speaker, sessions on recent research findings, personal stories of returnees, business sessions, and various forms of entertainment. At the 2003 annual conference in San Antonio, Texas, the keynote speaker was retired Rabbi Samuel Lerer who spent much of his 51-year career working with anusim in Mexico. The SCJS has taken a lead in interest in [[DNA]] studies, especially as it applies to crypto-Jews, other Sephardim, and the Jewish community in general.

{{political anthropology}}
'''State formation''' is the process of the development of a centralized government structure in a situation where one did not exist prior to its development.  State formation has been a study of many disciplines of the [[social science]]s for a number of years, so much so that Jonathan Haas writes that "One of the favorite pastimes of social scientists over the course of the past century has been to theorize about the evolution of the world's great civilizations."{{sfn|Haas|1982|p=1}} The study of state formation is divided generally into either the study of early states (those that developed in [[Stateless society|stateless societies]]) or the study of modern states (particularly of the form that developed in Europe in the 17th century and spread around the world). Academic debate about various theories is a prominent feature in fields like Anthropology, Sociology, Economics and Political Science.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=523}}

==The state==
{{main|State (polity)}}
A state is a political system with a centralized government, a military force, a civil service, an arranged society, and literacy. Though, there is no clear agreement on the defining characteristics of a state and the definition can vary significantly, based upon the focus of the particular definition.{{sfn|Haas|1982|pp=2-3}} The state is considered to be territoriality bound and is distinct from tribes or units without centralized institutions.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|pp=2-5}}

According to Painter &amp; Jeffrey, there are 5 distinctive features of the modern state:

1) They are ordered by precise boundaries with administrative control across the whole;

2) They occupy large territories with control given to organized institutions;

3) They have a capital city and are endowed with symbols that embody state power;

4) The government within state creates organizations to monitor, govern and control its population through surveillance and record keeping;

5) They increase monitoring over time.{{sfn|Painter|Jeffrey|2009|pp=22-24}}

Additionally, Herbst holds that there is another relevant characteristic of modern states: [[nationalism]]. This feeling of belonging to a certain territory plays a central role in state formation since it increases citizens' willingness to pay taxes.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}}

==Explaining early states and explaining modern states==
Theories of state formation have two distinct focuses, depending largely on the field of study:

# The early transition in human society from tribal communities into larger political organizations.  Studies of this topic, often in [[anthropology]], explore the initial development of basic administrative structures in areas where states developed from stateless societies.{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=129}} Although state formation was an active research agenda in anthropology and archaeology until the 1980s, some of the effort has changed to focus not on why these states formed but on how they operated.{{sfn|Marcus|Feinman|1998|p=3}} 
# In contrast, studies in [[political science]] and in [[sociology]] have focused significantly on the formation of the modern state.{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=131}}

States are minimally defined by anthropologist David S. Sandeford as socially stratified and bureaucratically governed societies with at least four levels of settlement hierarchy (e.g., a large capital, cities, villages, and hamlets). Primary states are those state societies that developed in regions where no states existed before. These states developed by strictly internal processes and interaction with other non-states societies.{{sfn|Sandeford|2018}} The exact number of cases which qualify as primary states is not clearly known because of limited information about political organization before the development of writing in many places,{{sfn|Wright|1977|p=386}} but Sandeford lists ten likely cases of primary state formation in Eurasia, the Americas, and the Pacific.{{sfn|Sandeford|2018}}

Studies on the formation of '''early states''' tend to focus on processes that create and institutionalize a state in a situation where a state did not exist before. Examples of early states which developed in interaction with other states include the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean Bronze Age Greek civilizations]] and the [[Malagasy culture#Madagascar|Malagasy civilization in Madagascar]].{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=306}} Unlike primary state formation, early state formation does not require the creation of the first state in that cultural context or development autonomously, independently from state development nearby. Early state formation causation can thus include borrowing, imposition, and other forms of interaction with already existing states.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=50}}

===Modern state formation===
Theories on the formation of modern states focus on the processes that support the development of modern states, particularly those that formed in late-medieval Europe and then spread around the world with colonialism. Starting in the 1940s and 1950s, with [[decolonization]] processes underway, attention began to focus on the formation and construction of modern states with significant bureaucracies, ability to tax, and territorial sovereignty around the world.{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=153}}{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=132}} However, some scholars hold that the modern state model formed in other parts of the world prior to colonialism, but that colonial structures replaced it.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=13}}

==Theories about early state development==
There are a number of different theories and hypotheses regarding early state formation that seek generalizations to explain why the state developed in some places but not others. Other scholars believe that generalizations are unhelpful and that each case of early state formation should be treated on its own.{{sfn|Spencer|Redmond|2004|p=174}}

===Voluntary theories===
[[File:City context.svg|thumb|right|Uruk one of the prime sites for research into early state formation]]
Voluntary theories contend that diverse groups of people came together to form states as a result of some shared rational interest.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}} The theories largely focus on the development of agriculture, and the population and organizational pressure that followed and resulted in state formation.  The argument is that such pressures result in integrative pressure for rational people to unify and create a state.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=21}} Much of the [[social contract]] philosophical tradition proposed a voluntary theory for state formation.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=21-23}}

One of the most prominent theories of early and primary state formation is the ''hydraulic hypothesis'', which contends that the state was a result of the need to build and maintain large-scale irrigation projects.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}} The theory was most significantly detailed [[Karl August Wittfogel]]'s argument that, in arid environments, farmers would be confronted by the production limits of small-scale irrigation. Eventually different agricultural producers would join together in response to population pressure and the arid environment, to create a state apparatus that could build and maintain large irrigation projects.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=734}}

In addition to this, is what Carneiro calls the ''automatic hypothesis'', which contends that the development of agriculture easily produces conditions necessary for the development of a state. With surplus food stocks created by agricultural development, creation of distinct worker classes and a division of labor would automatically trigger creation of the state form.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}}

A third voluntary hypothesis, particularly common with some explanations of early state development, is that long distance trade networks created an impetus for states to develop at key locations: such as ports or oases. For example, the increased trade in the 16th century may have been a key to state formation in West African states such as [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]], [[Dahomey]], and the [[Benin Empire]].{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}}

===Conflict theories===
Conflict theories of state formation regard conflict and dominance of some population over another population as key to the formation of states.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=734}} In contrast with voluntary theories, these arguments believe that people do not voluntarily agree to create a state to maximize benefits, but that states form due to some form of oppression by one group over others. A number of different theories rely on conflict, dominance, or oppression as a causal process or as a necessary mechanism within certain conditions and they may borrow from other approaches. In general the theories highlight: ''economic stratification'', ''conquest of other peoples'', conflict in ''circumscribed areas'', and the neoevolutionary growth of bureaucracy. 
[[File:Panorama of Monte Alban from the South Platform.jpg|thumb|center|650px|Panorama of Monte Albán in present-day Mexico, seen from the South Platform. Archeologists oftentimes look for evidence of such "large-scale construction projects, trade networks, and religious systems" to identify early states.{{sfn|Haas|1981|p=82}}]]

:*'''''Economic stratification'''''
:: [[Friedrich Engels]] articulated one of the earliest theories of the state based on anthropological evidence in ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' (1884).{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=6}} The theory of Engels developed from study of ''Ancient Society'' (1877) by [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and from the sketches of this work by [[Karl Marx]] on the [[Asiatic mode of production]].{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=25-26}} Engels argues that the state developed as a result of the need to protect private property. The theory contended that surplus production as a result of the development of agriculture created a division and specialization of labor: leading to classes who worked the land and to those who could devote time to other tasks. Class antagonism and the need to secure the private property of those living on the surplus production produced by agriculturalists resulted in the creation of the state.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=7}} The anthropologist [[Morton Fried]] (1923-1986) further developed this approach, positing social stratification as the primary dynamic underlying the development of the state.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=28-29}}

:*'''''Conquest theories'''''
:: Similar to the economic stratification theories, the conquest theory contends that a single city establishes a state in order to control other tribes or settlements it has conquered. The theory has its roots in the work of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1406) and of [[Jean Bodin]] (1530–1596), but it was first organized around anthropological evidence by [[Franz Oppenheimer]] (1864-1943).{{sfn|Service|1978|p=24}}{{sfn|Gross|1999|p=5}} Oppenheimer argues that the state was created to cement inequality between peoples that resulted from conquest.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=10}}

::[[Robert Carneiro]] developed a theory (1970){{sfn|Carneiro|1970}} aiming to provide a more nuanced understanding of state formation by accounting for the fact that many factors (surplus agriculture, warfare, irrigation, conquest, etc.) did not produce states in all situations. He concluded that while population pressure and warfare were mechanisms of state formation, they only created states in geographic regions circumscribed, or walled off from the surrounding area.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=13}} Geographic barriers (or in some cases barriers created by nomadic raiders or by rival societies) create limitations on the ability of the people to deal with production shortfalls, and the result is that warfare results in state creation.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=28-29}} In situations of unlimited agricultural land (like the Amazon or the Eastern United States), Carneiro believes that the pressures did not exist and so warfare allowed people to move elsewhere and thus did not spur creation of a state.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|pp=734-735}}

:*'''''Neoevolutionary theories'''''
:{{further|Neoevolutionism}}
::A number of different theories, sometimes connected with some of the processes above, explain state formation in terms of the [[Sociocultural evolution|evolution]] of [[leadership]] systems. This argument sees human society as evolving from [[tribe]]s or [[chiefdom]]s into states through a gradual process of transformation that lets a small group hierarchically structure society and maintain order through appropriation of [[symbol]]s of power.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=8}} Groups that gained power in tribal society gradually worked towards building the hierarchy and segmentation that created the state.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=9}}

::[[Elman Service]] (1915-1996) proposed that, unlike in economic stratification theories, the state largely creates stratification in society rather than being created to defend that stratification.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=38}} Bureaucracy evolves to support the leadership structure in tribes and uses religious hierarchy and economic stratification as a means to further increase its power.{{sfn|Haas|1982|p=73}} Warfare may play a key role in the situation, because it allows leaders to distribute benefits in ways that serve their interests, however it is a constant that feeds the system rather than an autonomous factor.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=51}} Similarly, anthropologist [[Henry T. Wright]] argues (2006) that competitive and conflictual environments produce political experimentation leading to the development of the state. As opposed to theories that the state develops through chance or tinkering, experimentation involves a more directed process where tribal leaders learn from organization forms of the past and from the outcomes they produced.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=316}}

===Other theories===
Other aspects are highlighted in different theories as of contributing importance. It is sometimes claimed that technological development, religious development, or socialization of members are crucial to state development. However, most of these factors are found to be secondary in anthropological analysis.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|pp=61-68}} In addition to conquest, some theories contend that the need for defense from military conquest or the military organization to conquer other peoples is the key aspect leading to state formation.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}}

===Discredited theories===
Some theories proposed in the 19th century and early 20th century have since been largely discredited by anthropologists. Carneiro writes that theories "with a racial basis, for example, are now so thoroughly discredited that they need not be dealt with...We can also reject the belief that the state is an expression of the 'genius' of a people, or that it arose through a 'historical accident.' Such notions make the state appear to be something metaphysical or adventitious, and thus place it beyond scientific understanding."{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}} Similarly, [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] perspectives like those of [[Walter Bagehot]] in ''Physics and Politics'' argued that the state form developed as a result of the best leaders and organized societies gradually gaining power until a state resulted. Such explanations are not considered sufficient to explain the formation of the state.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=24}}{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=42}}

==Theories about modern state development==
In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] (500-1400) in Europe, there were a variety of authority forms throughout the region. These included feudal lords, empires, religious authorities, free cities, and other authorities.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527}} Often dated to the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], there began to be the development in Europe of modern states with large-scale capacity for taxation, coercive control of their populations, and advanced bureaucracies.{{sfn|Axtmann|2004|p=260}} The state became prominent in Europe over the next few centuries before the particular form of the state spread to the rest of the world via the colonial and international pressures of the 19th century and 20th century.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=535}} Other modern states developed in Africa and Asia prior to colonialism, but were largely displaced by colonial rule.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=12}}

Political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists began studying the state formation processes in Europe and elsewhere in the 17th century—beginning significantly with [[Max Weber]]. However, state formation became a primary interest in the 1970s. The question was often framed as a contest between state forces and society forces and the study of how the state became prominent over particular societies.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=525}} A number of theories developed regarding state development in Europe. Other theories focused on the creation of states in late colonial and post-colonial societies.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=530}}  The lessons from these studies of the formation of states in the modern period are often used in theories about [[State-building]]. Other theories contend that the state in Europe was constructed in connection with peoples from outside Europe and that focusing on state formation in Europe as a foundation for study silences the diverse history of state formation.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=8}}

Based on the model of European states, it has been commonly assumed that development is the natural path that states will eventually walk through. However, Herbst holds that in the case African states, as well as in developing countries of other regions, development need not be the natural step. States that struggle their consolidation could remain permanently weak.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}}

===Warfare theories===
[[File:Defenestration-prague-1618.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A woodcut of the [[Defenestrations of Prague]] in 1618—which began the [[Thirty Years' War]] and ended with the Peace of Westphalia that started the recognition of the modern state]]

Two related theories are based on military development and warfare, and the role that these forces played in state formation. [[Charles Tilly]] developed an argument that the state developed largely as a result of "state-makers" who sought to increase the taxes they could gain from the people under their control so they could continue fighting wars.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527}} According to Tilly, the state makes war and war makes states.{{sfn|Tilly|1985|p=170}} In the constant warfare of the centuries in Europe, coupled with expanded costs of war with mass armies and gunpowder, warlords had to find ways to finance war  and control territory more effectively. The modern state presented the opportunity for them to develop taxation structures, the coercive structure to implement that taxation, and finally the guarantee of protection from other states that could get much of the population to agree.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527-528}} Taxes and revenue raising have been repeatedly pointed out as a key aspect of state formation and the development of state capacity. Economist [[Nicholas Kaldor]] emphasized on the importance of revenue raising and warned about the dangers of the dependence on foreign aid.{{sfn|Kaldor|1963}} Tilly argues, state making is similar to organized crime because it is a "quintessential protection racket with the advantage of legitimacy."{{sfn|Tilly|1985|p=169}}

[[Michael Roberts (historian)|Michael Roberts]] and [[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]], in contrast, finds that the primary causal factor was not the "state-makers" themselves, but simply the military revolutions that allowed development of larger armies.{{sfn|Thompson|Rasler|1999|p=5}} The argument is that with the expanded state of warfare, the state became the only administrative unit that could endure in the constant warfare in the Europe of this period, because only it could develop large enough armies.{{sfn|Thompson|Rasler|1999|p=6}} 
This view—that the modern state replaced chaos and general violence with internal disciplinary structures—has been challenged as ethnocentric, and ignoring the violence of modern states.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=19}}

War has played a key role not only in the consolidation of European states but also of some third world states. According to Herbst, external security threats have had a fundamental role in the development of the [[South Korea]]n and [[Taiwan]]ese states.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}} A 2017 study which tests the predictions of warfare theories of Tilly and others found that the predictions do not match the empirical record.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The study found that median state size decreased from 1100 to 1800, and that the number of states increases rapidly between the twelfth and thirteen centuries and remained constant until 1800.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}}

===Commerce theories===
[[Stein Rokkan]] and others have argued that the modern territorial state developed in places that were peripheral to the commercial "city belt" ("a central regional band extending, roughly, in an arc from the Low Countries, through the Rhineland and into Northern Italy") that ran through Central Europe.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The existence of prosperous urban centers that relied on commerce in Central Europe prevented rulers from consolidaing their rule over others.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The elites in those urban centers could rely on their wealth and on collective security institutions (like the Hanseatic or Swabian league) with other urban centers to sustain their independence. A lower density of urban centers in England and France made it easier for rulers to establish rule over expansive territories.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}}

===Feudal crisis theories===
Another argument contends that the state developed out of economic and social crises that were prominent in late-medieval Europe. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants, and the involvement of leaders in the domains of other leaders under religious reasons was the primary problem dealt with in the Peace of Westphalia.{{sfn|Axtmann|2004|p=260}} In addition, Marxist theory contends that the economic crisis of feudalism forced the aristocracy to adapt various centralized forms of organization so they could retain economic power, and this resulted in the formation of the modern state.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=529}}

===Cultural theories===
Some scholarship, linked to wider debates in Anthropology, has increasingly emphasized the state as a primarily cultural artifact, and focuses on how symbolism plays a primary role in state formation.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=9}} Most explicitly, some studies emphasize how the creation of national identification and citizenship were crucial to state formation. The state then is not simply a military or economic authority, but also includes cultural components creating consent by people by giving them rights and shared belonging.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=530}}

===Outside Europe===
While modern states existed without European influence around the world before colonialism,{{sfn|Ejogu|2011|p=595}} post-colonial state formation has received the most significant attention.{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=155}} While warfare is primary in theories about state formation in Europe, the development of the international norm of [[non-interventionism]] means that other processes of state formation have become prominent outside Europe (including colonial imposition, assimilation, borrowing, and some internal political processes.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=531}}{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=155}} [[John W. Meyer|John W. Meyer's]] ''World Society Theory'' contends that the state form was exported from Europe, institutionalized in the United Nations, and gradually the modern nation-state became the basis for both those in power and those challenging power.{{sfn|Wimmer|Feinstein|2010|p=769}} In addition, because many of the early modern states like the United Kingdom and France had significant empires, their institutional templates became standard for application globally.{{sfn|Wimmer|Feinstein|2010|p=769}}

'''Transport geography''', also ''transportation geography'', is a branch of [[geography]] that investigates the movement and connections between people, goods and information on the [[Earth's surface]].

==Aims and scope==
Transportation geography detects, describes, and explains the Earth's surface's transportation spaces regarding location, substance, form, function, and genesis. It also investigates the effects of transportation on land use, on the physical material patterns at the surface of the earth known as 'cover patterns', and on other spatial processes such as environmental alterations. Moreover, it contributes to [[Transport planning|transport]], urban, and regional [[planning]].

[[Transportation]] is fundamental to the economic activity of exchange. Therefore, transport geography and [[economic geography]] are largely interrelated. At the most basic level, humans move and thus interact with each other by walking, but transportation geography typically studies more complex regional or global systems of transportation that include multiple interconnected modes like [[public transit]], personal [[cars]], [[bicycles]], freight [[railroads]], [[the Internet]], [[airplanes]] and more. Such systems are increasingly urban in character. Thus, transport and [[urban geography]] are closely intertwined. [[Cities]] are very much shaped, indeed created, by the types of exchange and interaction facilitated by movement.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. 1949 / 1995 The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Phillip II. Berkeley: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly since the 19th century, transportation is seen as a way cities, countries or firms compete with each other in a variety of spaces and contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S., Marvin, S. 2001. Splintering Urbanism: Networked Infrastructures, Technological Mobilities and the Urban Condition: Networked Infrastructures, Technological Mobilites and the Urban Condition. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation modes==
{{Transportation geography graphical timeline}}
In terms of transport modes, the primary forms are [[Air transport|air]], [[Road transport|road]], [[Water transport|water]], and [[Rail transport|rail]].  Each form has its own cost associated with 'speed of movement', which is affected by friction, place of origin, and destination.  [[Ship]]s are generally used for moving large amounts of goods.  Maritime [[shipping]] is able to carry more around the world at a cheaper cost.   For moving people who prefer to minimize travel time and maximize comfort and convenience, road and air are the most common modes in use. A railroad is often used to transport goods in areas away from water. Railroads may also be the source of transportation for people as well.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
" Transportation modes are an essential component of transport systems since they are the means by which mobility is supported. Geographers consider a wide range of modes that may be grouped into three broad categories based on the medium they exploit: land, water and air. Each mode has its own requirements and features, and is adapted to serve the specific demands of freight and passenger traffic. This gives rise to marked differences in the ways the modes are deployed and used in different parts of the world. Recently, there is a trend towards integrating the modes through intermodality and linking the modes ever more closely into production and distribution activities. At the same time; however, passenger and freight activity is becoming increasingly separated across most modes." &lt;ref&gt;Dr. [[Jean-Paul Rodrigue]], Dept. of Economics &amp; Geography, Hofstra University&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Road transportation===
{{Main|Road transport}}
Road transportation networks are connected with movements on constructed roads; carrying people and goods from one place to another by means of lorries, cars, etc. Transportation may be further categorized by the vehicle used or the purpose for transport itself.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Maritime transportation===
{{Main|Maritime transport}}
Water transportation is the slowest form of transportation in the movement of goods and people.
Strategic chokepoints around the world have continued to play significant roles in maritime industry. Although the slowest form of transportation compared to road and rail transport, it is the most cost effective.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

=== Rail Transportation ===

[[Rail transport]]ation is the movement of cargo, goods, and passengers on trains as a form of transportation. Transportation by rails has been established as one of the safest modes of transportation over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://election.princeton.edu/2015/05/13/train-travel-is-incredibly-safe/|title=Train travel is incredibly safe|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges for transportation==
[[File:Seattle Traffic.jpg|thumb|Seattle traffic at I-5 and Yesler Way]]
Transportation availability on existing streets, highways, and rail facilities no longer match the transportation demands created by subsequent population growth and new location patterns of economic activity. Besides an increase in population, another problem is vehicles overloading the network of highways and arterial streets. See [[Traffic congestion]], [[Transport network|Transportation network]], and [[Population densities]]

The well-being of poor people and people who live in developing areas can be threatened by systems of transportation that fail to connect them to jobs and medical assistance. For example, areas of [[Southern California]] have transportation systems that do not connect the homeless to these necessities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laris|first1=William G. Moseley, Eric Perramond, Holly M. Hapke, &amp; Paul|title=An introduction to human-environment geography : local dynamics and global processes|date=2014|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester (West Sussex)|isbn=978-1-4051-8931-6|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Environmental Justice]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11106">'''World Federation for Medical Education''' (WFME) is a [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisation]] concerned with education and training of medical doctors worldwide. WFME’s main objective is to "enhance the quality of medical education worldwide, with promotion of the highest scientific and ethical standards in medical education". The organisation develops standards for medical education and promotes accreditation of medical schools. It also co-manages the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdoms.org/|title=World Directory of Medical Schools|website=www.wdoms.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WFME works in partnership with its six Regional Associations for Medical Education&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/about/member-associations|title=WFME Member Associations|last=|first=|date=|website=wfme.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other international organisations including the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/register-nonstate-actors/nsa.aspx?id=151|title=WHO Register of non-State actors (Pilot)|website=apps.who.int|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Medical Association]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wma.net/who-we-are/alliance-and-partner/partners/|title=WMA - The World Medical Association-Partners|website=www.wma.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; with WFME’s associate members, and with medical schools worldwide.

== History ==
WFME was founded on the 30 September 1972 in [[Copenhagen]]. The founding organisations included the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[World Medical Association]] (WMA).

In 1988 the Edinburgh declaration was approved at the World Conference on Medical Education, calling for greater co-operation between the health system and the education system, reflecting national needs in medical education and continuing lifelong education of medical staff to achieve quality in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/projects/wfme-publications/99-the-edinburgh-declaration/file|title=The Edinburgh Declaration 1989|last=|first=|date=|website=wfme.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration was adopted by the [[World Health Assembly]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/172229/1/WHA42_R38_eng.pdf|title=Edinburgh Declaration on the reform of medical education|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of medical education responding to the national needs was also stressed at the World Summit on Medical Education 1993.

WFME participated in the Global Consensus Project for Social Accountability of Medical Schools initiated in 2010, which further focused on the co-operation and link between medical education and the society, highlighting the necessity to meet the health care needs of patients and societies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/documents/about-wfme/79-wfme-history-of-the-first-forty-years-1972-2012/file|title=WFME History of the first 40 years|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 2008-2014 WFME maintained the [[Avicenna Directories|Avicenna]] directory, a public database of worldwide&amp;nbsp;[[medical schools]],&amp;nbsp;[[Pharmacy school|schools of pharmacy]], schools of&amp;nbsp;[[public health]]&amp;nbsp;and educational institutions of other academic health professions, which was later merged with [[International Medical Education Directory|IMED]] to create the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]].&lt;ref name="wdoms.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdoms.org/about/|title=World Directory of Medical Schools {{!}} About|website=www.wdoms.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WFME previously had offices in Bethesda, [[Maryland]] (USA) and [[Edinburgh]] (UK), and most recently in [[Copenhagen]] (Denmark) and Ferney-Voltaire (France). The organisation is currently registered in the UK and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uia.org/s/or/en/1100024502|title=World Federation for Medical Education {{!}} Yearbook Profile {{!}} Union of International Associations|website=www.uia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/home/contact|title=WFME Contact page|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The three major projects WFME currently prioritises are the creation of global standards&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/standards|title=WFME Standards|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for quality improvement of medical education, managing the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/projects/directories|title=WFME Directories|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Recognition of Accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/accreditation|title=WFME Accreditation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing Global Standards, the WFME appointed three International Task Forces, one for each of the three phases of medical education:
* basic (undergraduate) Medical Education (BME)
* postgraduate medical education (PME)
* continuing medical education (CME)/professional development of medical doctors (CPD)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
Building on the standards, WFME provides guidance on establishing medical schools in the context of global standards but also with respect to the national need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/projects/guidance|title=WFME Criteria for establishment of a new medical school|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with FAIMER, WFME co-manages the [[World Directory of Medical Schools|World Directory of Medical School]], a public database of medical schools worldwide.&lt;ref name="wdoms.org"/&gt;

WFME Recognition Programme aims to ensure that [[accreditation]] of medical schools in the world, is at an internationally accepted standard. WFME awards Recognition Status to the [[accrediting agencies]] that apply and are assessed to be up to the agreed standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/accreditation/accrediting-accreditors/recognition-process|title=WFME Recognition process|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates|ECFMG]] published&amp;nbsp;a press release stating that students applying for [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates|ECFMG]] Certification&amp;nbsp;after 2023 will be required to have graduated from a medical school that has been "appropriately accredited by an agency that uses criteria comparable to those established for U.S. medical schools by the&amp;nbsp;[[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]] (LCME)&amp;nbsp;or that uses other globally accepted criteria, such as WFME’s".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecfmg.org/forms/9212010.press.release.pdf|title=ECFMG 2023 press release|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WFME also develops a project on the Role of the Doctor in the modern society, reflecting the changing position of the medical professions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/projects/role-of-the-doctor|title=WFME Role of the Doctor|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
WFME strategy is developed and agreed at the yearly Executive Council meeting. The Executive Council includes &amp;nbsp;the directors of the six regional organisations, representatives of the founding organisations ([[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Medical Association|WMA]]) and collaborating organisations ([[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates|ECFMG]], [[International Federation of Medical Students' Associations|IFMSA]]) The [[Junior Doctors Network]] of WMA also attends by invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/about/executive-council|title=WFME Executive council|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
