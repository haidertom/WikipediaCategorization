'''''Art Workers News''''', also known as '''''Art &amp; Artists''''', was the highly influential artist-run publication of the [[Foundation for the Community of Artists]] (FCA), an organization that grew out of the National Art Workers Community (a splinter group of the [[Art Workers Coalition|Art Workers’ Coalition]]). From 1971 to 1989, the publication was the paper of record for the world of working artists. Its circulation reached a high of 40 thousand subscribers.
{{infobox newsletter
|image=Art and Artists Full Page.jpg
}}

Originally a four-page newsletter, ''Art Workers News'' grew into a monthly newspaper. During the early 1980s, FCA changed the publication’s name to ''Art&amp;Artists'' and made it a bi-monthly.

Rather than reviewing shows, AWN/A&amp;A focused on topics central to the lives of working artists in the 1970s and ’80s, (and continuing today): artist housing, health hazards, business practices, health insurance, women’s issues, issues affecting artists of color, law and the arts and censorship were impacting the daily life of artists. The publication featured, as well, contemporary theories and philosophies in the arts, general news articles, a select number of book reviews, commentaries, editorials and special issues.

The special issues were wide-ranging, reflecting the times and the interests of the editors and writers who were involved at a given time over the course of its existence.

Special issues included: “Art Against Apartheid.” “Art and Sports,” “Are There Too Many Artists?,” “Tilted Arc by Richard Serra,” "Museums," and “Artists Against US Intervention in Central America.”

''Art Workers News'' was also the publication of record for the [[CETA_Artists_Project_(NYC_Cultural_Council_Foundation_1978-80)|Comprehensive Employment Act (CETA) Artists Program]] in New York City and documented the work of artists in all media associated with the project.&lt;ref&gt;Judd Tully, a writer for the CETA Artists Project, has digitized some of his ''AWN'' articles (retrieved 1/30/18) &lt;http://juddtully.net/publications/art-workers-news/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

''AWN/A&amp;A'' produced 160 issues over eighteen years. Editors and production staff were volunteers; writers and photographers were paid (minimally) in accordance with the belief that people, including artists and writers, deserved to be paid for their work. The journal newspaper gave voice to many artists, critics and journalists who were prominent in the cultural milieu of its time, as well as to younger professionals at the start of their careers.

Many of the original newsprint issues and some microfiche editions are catalogued in libraries across the U.S., Canada and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;WorldCat lists the number of libraries archiving AWN/A&amp;A at 44 (retrieved 1/30/18) &lt;http://www.worldcat.org/title/artworkers-news/oclc/3257241&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Fales Library at New York University has most of the volumes, and is a source for researchers, artists, art historians, students and scholars. Gwen Allen, a professor at San Francisco State University includes additional information about the publication in her book, ''Artists’ Magazines: An Alternative Space for Art.''&lt;ref&gt;''Artists’ Magazines: An Alternative Space for Art'', Gwen Allen, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2011, p 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Austral University of Chile''' ({{lang-es|Universidad Austral de Chile}} or UACh) is a [[research university]] in [[Chile]] based in [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]] although it has some institutions and programs in [[Puerto Montt]]. Founded by decree on 7 September 1954 it is one of the eight original [[Chilean Traditional Universities]]. Juridically it is a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] self-owned [[corporation]] under [[private law]] and is significantly [[Subsidy|state-financed]].

==History==

===Foundation and early years (1942-1968)===
The history of UACh dates back to 1942 when a society called ''Sociedad de Amigos del Arte'' was formed in the city of Valdivia to promote culture. One of the society's main goals was the establishment of a university in the city.  The idea of creating a university was presented to the national congress in the 1950s by the [[Senate of Chile|senator]] for Valdivia, Carlos Acharán Pérez de Arce, who later succeeded in consolidating the project. In a meeting held on 16 February 1954 supporters of installing a university created a directory and proclaimed [[Eduardo Morales Miranda]] as president of it.  The initial founding depended on donations from private persons including some industrial businessmen. After have been founded by decree on 7 September 1954 the university was [[inauguration|inaugurated]] on 12 March 1955 by president [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]]. The inauguration was also attended by the rectors of the [[University of Chile]] and the States Technical University as well as the ambassadors of [[Venezuela]] and [[Argentina]] and representatives of the Netherlands, Germany and the United States.

The first degree programmes to be taught at the university were [[fine art]]s, [[agronomy]], [[forestry|forestry engineering]] and [[veterinary medicine]], each of which had also its own faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uach.cl/historia.php Historia de la Universidad Austral de Chile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130030424/http://www.uach.cl/historia.php |date=January 30, 2009 }} Austral University of Chile&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3 of 1968 UACh was granted autonomy from the University of Chile as law 16.848 was enacted. The autonomy did that UACh became allowed to decide its own plans and study programs and put the university out of the tutelage of the University of Chile.

===Development (1969-1999)===
[[Image:Casas UACh.JPG|240px|thumb|right|Picture of one of the "A"-houses of Universidad Austral near [[Valdivia River]] in [[Isla Teja]] Campus]]
During the [[Chile under Pinochet|military regime's]] privatization of higher education in the 1980s UACh incorporated the successor regional see of ''Universidad Técnica del Estado'', the ''Instituto Profesional de Valdivia''. By doing this, UACh prevented an offshoot university from being created there as it happened around the country with regional sees of major universities. With the incorporation of ''Instituto Profesional de Valdivia'', that corresponds to present day 'Campus Miraflores, UACh started to grant [[bachelor degree]]s in engineering and got its Engineering Faculty.

In 1993 the university held the [[Valdivia International Film Festival]] for the first time to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its cinema Cine Club which has since then developed to one of the most important film festivals in Chile.

===Recent history (2000-present)===
With the arrival of [[Centro de Estudios Científicos]] (CECS) to Valdivia in 2000 the city was further outlined as a research center, as CECS brought expertise on [[biophysics]], [[molecular physiology]], [[theoretical physics]], [[glaciology]] and [[climate change]] to the city. The arrival of CECS was seen as positive by UACh's administration since CECS research do not overlap UACh's main research areas and, as a scientific research corporation, do not compete in student enrollment. However, in 2007 UACh and CECS got involved in a controversy when the Regional Council of [[Los Lagos Region]] granted regional funds that had been put into [[Call for bids|tender]] to CECS without attending to the meeting where UACh's and [[University of Los Lagos]] joint project was presented. Deputy [[Gabriel Ascencio]] ([[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|DC]]) accused [[Claudio Bunster]], director of CECS, of using his personal influence among politicians and the Council of Innovation for Competitiveness (of which he is member of) to gain more resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Es icon}} [http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20070512/pags/20070512224215.html "http://www.lannacion.cl"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012424/http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20070512/pags/20070512224215.html |date=2007-09-27 }} ''[[La Nación (Santiago)|La Nación]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 3 December 2007 the  Emilio Pugín building of the Faculty of Sciences caught fire. The building, located on [[Teja island]] Campus housed considerable amounts of chemicals and scientific equipment which could not be saved. Several research projects had to be halted or aborted due to loss of equipment, samples and data. Due to the spreading of toxic smoke the  police had to evacuate a total of 10,000 people from Isla Teja. Firefighting companies from the neighboring cities of [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]], [[La Unión, Chile|La Unión]] and [[Paillaco]] had to come to assist to control and extinguish the fire. The building hosted the institutes of chemistry, physics, zoology, microbiology and botanics, including some laboratories. The cost of the damage was estimated at about 5000 million [[Chilean peso]]s (about 10 million US dollars).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elnaveghable.cl/admin/render/noticia/12467 Incendio en Universidad Austral de Chile], ''[[El Naveghable]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, 22% of the damage were not covered by the according insurances, but [[Subsidy|directly financed]] by the [[Chilean government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uach.cl/organizacion/rectoria/noticia.php?codigo%3D8427 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728100459/http://www.uach.cl/organizacion/rectoria/noticia.php?codigo=8427 |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13 of 2008 the [[student federation]] of UACh decided to go on [[Student strike|strike]] since they considered that a request list sent to the university administration was answered in too loose terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elnaveghable.cl/admin/render/noticia/14307 ¡A la calle!: a los estudiantes de la UACh se les acabó la paciencia], [[El Naveghable]]&lt;/ref&gt; The strike and occupation of the university by students ended in late June when the rector Victor Cubillos and the directory ceded on several points but was however still heavily criticized both from students and from sectors of the [[teacher|faculty]] where they considered that he had ceded too much to students. On April 2010 the reconstruction of the Emilio Pugin building of the Sciencie Faculty, started the competitive bidding. And in this year it would start the reconstruction. Cubillos won the 2010 election with 229 votes, 13 less than the prior election. the second term ended in June 2014.

==Campus==

UACh main campus, Isla Teja Campus, occupies the whole northwest of [[Isla Teja]] in Valdivia. Campus Isla Teja is the home of UACh's administration, [[Cine Club]], [[botanical garden]] and most faculties. The botanical garden is a recreational area as well as a place of study with a total of around 950 plant species growing in its 12 [[hectare|ha]].&lt;ref name=jardin&gt;[http://www.ciencias.uach.cl/unidades/jardin-botanico.php Jardín Botánico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315061756/http://www.ciencias.uach.cl/unidades/jardin-botanico.php |date=2012-03-15 }}. Revised on April 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Most plants in the botanical garden belong to [[Valdivian temperate rain forest]] but there are others with exotic origins. The waters of [[Cau-Cau River]] that flows through the northern parts of the botanical garden allows a section of wetland plant species included in the garden.

The engineering faculty operates in Campus Miraflores located along [[Valdivia River]] south of Valdivia's [[Valdivia, Chile|Plaza de Armas]]. A third campus exists in [[Puerto Montt]] where [[administration (business)|business administration]], [[speech and language pathology]] and [[aquaculture]] are studied.  UACh has apart from the campuses several properties spread through [[Los Ríos Region|Los Ríos]] and [[Los Lagos Region]] such as Parque [[Arboretum]] in northern Isla Teja, the Calfuco field station in the coast near [[Niebla, Chile|Niebla]] and the [[Valdivian temperate rainforest|forests of San Pablo de Tregua]] in the Andean foothills.

==Research==
[[Image:Sanpablotregua.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Faculty of UACh in the forests of San Pablo de Tregua]]
UACh is one of the leading universities of Chile in matters of scientific research. It was ranked second only to the University of Chile in scientific research by ''[[El Mercurio]]'' and was the third university to receive most of government ''Mecesup'' research funds in 2008.&lt;ref name=emol/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universia.cl/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad.jsp?noticia=143845 Universidad Austral de Chile se adjudica 1.582 millones en el Concurso Mecesup 2008]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Universia&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the fields where UACh scientists have made contributions include:

*'''Archaeology:''' In [[archeology]] university scientists [[Mario Pino Quivira|Mario Pino]] and [[Tom Dillehay]], led the excavations of at [[Monte Verde]], one of the earliest [[archaeological site]]s in the Americas. Another site investigated by university scientists is [[Chan-Chan]] a site that gives name to the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] [[Chan-Chan|Chan-Chan Complex]].&lt;ref name=pino&gt;{{es icon}} [[Mario Pino Quivira|Pino, Mario]] and Navarro, Rayen.

''[[Andean Geology|Revista Geológica de Chile]]'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Dairy technology and science:''' The university's ''Centro Tecnológico de la Leche'' (lit. Milk Technology Centre) have been credited by scholar Paulina Rytkönen for being behind the higher dairy productivity in [[Los Ríos Region]] when compared with adjacent [[Los Lagos Region]].&lt;ref&gt;Rytkönen, P. Fruits of Capitalism: Modernization of Chilean Agriculture, 1950-2000. ''Lund Studies in Economic History'', 31, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Dendrochronology:''' Scientists at the [[Dendrochronology]] Laboratory of UACh has set up the longest dendrochronology in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] going back 5666 years. Researchers have also reconstructed the temperatures of the last 3622 years with [[tree ring]]s from [[Fitzroya]] and have used  a dendrochronology network of [[Lenga Beech]], spanning from [[Talca]] to [[Navarino Island]], to investigate [[global warming]] in the recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dendrocronologia.cl/lab_quienes.html ¿Quiénes somos?] Laboratorio de Dendrocronología&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mapudungun language:''' UACh is one of the main sites of [[Mapudungun language|Mapudungun linguistic]] studies and teaching. This is partly due to Professor [[María Catrileo Chiguailaf]], who received in 2009 the ''Provincial Prize for Conservation of National Monuments'' for her studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uach.cl/rrpp/online/ver.php?not=2124 Académica de la Universidad Austral de Chile Recibió Premio Provincial de Conservación de Monumentos Nacionales]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Noticias UACh&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has focused on the [[phonology]] and morpho-[[syntax]] of the Mapudungun language and especially the [[verb form]]s. Catrileo may be the only living [[Mapuche]] to have mastered Spanish, English, and Mapudungun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/36/3c/eb.pdf María Catrileo's Works on the Tagmemics of Mapuche]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Palaeontology:''' [[paleontology|Palaeontological]] studies at [[Southern Chile]] have involved several UACh academics among them [[geoarchaeology|geoarchaeologist]] [[Mario Pino Quivido|Mario Pino]] who participated at the excavation of the [[Quaternary]] fossil site of [[Pilauco Bajo]] in [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]] where the remains of a species of ''[[Gomphotherium]]'' were discovered. Two other ''Gomphotherium'' fossil sites in [[Los Ríos Region]] are planned to be excavated by university scientists in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uach.cl/rrpp/online/ver.php?not=12419 Presentaron Libro sobre Sitio Paleontológico Pilauco Bajo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203234657/http://www.uach.cl/rrpp/online/ver.php?not=12419 |date=December 3, 2008 }} Noticias UACh&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Virology:''' Researchers from the Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Science led a series of joint medical, [[virus|viral]] and [[zoological]] research on the transmittance of [[Hantavirus]] between [[rodent]]s and humans. Hantavirus was first detected in Chile in 1995 but is believed to have been present much time before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0034-98872003000200006&amp;script=sci_arttext Síndrome pulmonar por Hantavirus] Revista médica de Chile&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Luis Zaror the most important UACh discovery regarding Hantavirus was made in 2005 when Hanta [[antigen]]s were found on the [[salivary gland]]s of deceased persons. UACh academics working at the Laboratory of [[Virology]] had contributed to diminish the initial [[Mortality rate|mortality]] of [[Hantavirus|Pulmonar Hantavirus]] with 60% in [[Los Ríos Region]] below the national average of 37%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universia.cl/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad.jsp?noticia=128553 Universidad Austral de Chile: Una década de vanguardia académica e investigación]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Universia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific journals===
The university publishes several [[scientific journal]]s three of them, ''[[Bosque (journal)|Bosque]]'', ''[[Archivos de Medicina Veterinaria]]'' and ''[[Estudios filológicos]]'' are part of [[Institute for Scientific Information|ISI]]'s [[bibliographic database]]. ''BOSQUE'' is published by the Faculty of Forest Science. ''BOSQUE's'' first number was published in 1975 and was yearly issued until 1985. From 1985 to 2003 it was issued twice a year and from 2003 on thrice a year. The topics covered in ''BOSQUE'' are management and production of forestry resources, wood science and technology, [[silviculture]], [[forest ecology|forestry ecology]], natural resources conservation, and [[rural development]] associated with forest ecosystems. Contributions are articles, notes and opinions, both in Spanish and English. ''BOSQUE'' became part of ISI's bibliographic database in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universia.cl/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad.jsp?noticia=145321 Celebran indexación de publicación de la Universidad Austral de Chile en ISI]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Universia&lt;/ref&gt;

In matters of literature, [[Communication sciences|communication science]] and [[linguistics]] the university has published the journal ''Documentos Lingüísticos y Literarios'' (DLL) since 1977. ''Documentos Lingüísticos y Literarios'' has two sections, one dedicated to articles and comments on literature, linguistics and communication science and another were original literary pieces are published. DLL is one of the few journals containing native [[Mapudungun]] literature and linguistic articles.

== Museum network ==
Universidad Austral de Chile runs through its [[museology]] department several museums in Valdivia and southern Chile, including; [[Museo de Arte Contemporaneo|UACh's Contemporary Art Museum]], [[Museo de la Exploración Rudolph Amandus Philippi|Philippi Museum]] on the 19th century exploration and settlement of southern Chile and [[Museo Histórico y Antropológico Maurice van de Maele|Maurice van de Maele Museum]] on history and anthropology. The museology department has collections of indigenous artifacts including early indigenous ceramics as well as [[Mapuche silverwork]] and textiles. In addition to this there is a collection of objects from the early human settlement of [[Monte Verde]]. Other collections include 19th century clothing and toys and an extensive photographical archive dating back to 1850.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uach.cl/direccion/museologica/c_archfoto.htm Dirección Museológica UACh] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728100553/http://www.uach.cl/direccion/museologica/c_archfoto.htm |date=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rankings==
[[image:UACh-Centro de Educación Continua-noche.JPG|thumb|190px|Centro de Educación continua building in downtown Valdivia]]
In a 2011 university ranking of [[Quacquarelli Symonds]] the Austral University of Chile was ranked 30th among Latin American universities, 5th among Chilean universities and second among Chilean universities outside Santiago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/latin-american-university-rankings/2011 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[El Mercurio]]'''s 2006 ranking of the "Best Universities in the Country", UACh received the highest score in "teaching quality" of any Chilean university.  The same article also listed UACh second only to [[Universidad de Chile]] in research quality, and ranked the Valdivia-based university third place overall among Chilean universities.  As both universities that earned higher rankings are located in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] (U. de Chile and [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]]), UACh thus became the highest ranking university in Chile outside of the nation's capital.&lt;ref name=emol&gt;[http://www.emol.com/especiales/infografias/ranking_universidad/index.htm# El Mercurio Ranking of Universities]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most recent Chilean university ranking released by AméricaEconomía magazine, released in 2009, UACh earned an overall ranking of 7th place, and 4th among universities outside Santiago. In the undergraduate ranking, nursing performed best with 3rd place, then medicine and agronomy at 4th place, then law at 7th place, kinesiology at 8th place and Business Administration (Ingeniería Comercial) at 10th place.&lt;ref name="AmericaEconomía"&gt;[http://rankings.americaeconomia.com/pregrado-chile/ranking_universidades_pregrado_chile.html Ranking 2009 Las mejores universidades de Chile]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 UACh's medical students got the second highest marks in Chile in the National Medicine Exam after [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile|PUC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universia.cl/html_estatico/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad/param/noticia/bbggcf.html Medicine exam in Universia.cl] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919162720/http://www.universia.cl/html_estatico/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad/param/noticia/bbggcf.html |date=September 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, though, UACh medical students dropped down to fifth place, and by 2008 they were down to sixth place.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050205124944/http://www.emn.cl/resultados.html Resultados por escuela 2003-2008] Examen Medico Nacional&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''battery electric vehicle''' ('''BEV'''), '''pure electric vehicle''' or '''all-electric vehicle''' is a type of [[electric vehicle]] (EV) that uses [[chemical energy]] stored in [[rechargeable battery]] [[battery pack|packs]]. BEVs use [[electric motor]]s and [[motor controller]]s instead of [[internal combustion engine]]s (ICEs) for propulsion. They derive all power from battery packs and thus have no internal combustion engine, [[fuel cell]], or [[fuel tank]]. BEVs include - but are not limited to&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boringcompany.com/faq/|title=FAQ|website=The Boring Company|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"literally hundreds of electric thrusters now operating in orbit on communications satellites, and ion and Hall thrusters both having  been  successfully  used..." -https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/SciTechBook/series1/Goebel__cmprsd_opt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; - motorcycles, bicycles, scooters, skateboards, rail cars, watercraft, forklifts, buses, trucks, and cars.

==Terminology==
{{See also|Hybrid electric vehicle|Plug-in hybrid|Plug-in electric vehicle}}
Vehicles using both electric motors and internal combustion engines are examples of [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s, and are not considered pure or all-electric vehicles because they cannot be externally charged (operate in charge-sustaining mode) and instead they are continually recharged with power from the [[internal combustion engine]] and [[regenerative braking]].&lt;ref name=PEVs/&gt;

[[Hybrid vehicle]]s with batteries that can be charged externally to displace some or all of their internal combustion engine power and [[gasoline]] fuel are called [[plug-in hybrid]] electric vehicles (PHEV), and run as BEVs during their [[charge-depleting]] mode. PHEVs with a [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain#Series hybrid|series]] [[powertrain]] are also called range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs), such as the [[Chevrolet Volt]] and [[Fisker Karma]].

[[Plug-in electric vehicle]]s (PEVs) are a subcategory of [[electric vehicle]]s that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and [[electric vehicle conversion]]s of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles.&lt;ref name=PEVs&gt;{{cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|editor=[[David B. Sandalow]]|year=2009 |publisher=The Brookings Institution |isbn=978-0-8157-0305-1|edition=1st.|url=http://www.brookings.edu/press/Books/2009/pluginelectricvehicles.aspx|pages=2–5}}''See definition on pp. 2.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CSE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energycenter.org/index.php/technical-assistance/transportation/electric-vehicles|title=Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs)|publisher=Center for Sustainable Energy, California|accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, plug-in electric vehicles, together with hybrid electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).&lt;ref name=NEVs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTNEWSCHINESE/Resources/3196537-1202098669693/EV_Report_en.pdf|title=The China New Energy Vehicles Program - Challenges and Opportunities |author=PRTM Management Consultants |publisher=World Bank |date=April 2011|accessdate=2012-02-29}} ''See Acronyms and Key Terms, pp. v''&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States, [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s (NEVs) are battery electric vehicles that are legally limited to roads with posted speed limits no higher than 45 miles per hour (72&amp;nbsp;km/h), are usually built to have a top speed of 30 miles per hour (48&amp;nbsp;km/h), and have a maximum loaded weight of 3,000&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/02/06/greenlings-what-is-a-neighborhood-electric-vehicle-nev/|title=What is a neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV)?|date=2009-02-06|publisher= AutoblogGreen| accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vehicles by type==
The concept of battery electric vehicles is to use charged [[electric vehicle battery|batteries]] on board vehicles for propulsion. Battery electric cars are becoming more and more attractive with the advancement of new battery technology ([[Lithium Ion]]) that have higher power and [[energy density]] (i.e., greater possible acceleration and more range with fewer batteries) and higher oil prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4futureenergy.com/BatteryElectric.htm|title=-|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205073246/http://www.4futureenergy.com/BatteryElectric.htm|archivedate=5 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BEVs include [[automobile]]s, [[Truck#Light trucks|light trucks]], and [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s.

A battery-powered [[electric car]] is an [[automobile]] which is [[ground propulsion|propelled]] by [[electric motor]]s.

Although electric cars often give good acceleration and have generally acceptable top speed, the lower [[specific energy]] of production batteries available in 2015 compared with [[carbon-based fuel]]s means that electric cars need batteries that are fairly large fraction of the vehicle mass but still often give relatively low range between charges. Recharging can also take significant lengths of time. For journeys within a single battery charge, rather than long journeys, electric cars are practical forms of transportation and can be recharged overnight.

[[Formula E]] is a fully electric international single seater championship. The series was conceived in 2012, and the inaugural championship started in Beijing on 13 September 2014. The series is sanctioned by the FIA. Alejandro Agag is the current CEO of Formula E.

The Formula E championship is currently contested by ten teams with two drivers each (after the withdrawal of Team Trulli, there are temporarily only nine teams competing). Racing generally takes place on temporary city-center street circuits which are approximately 2 to 3.4&amp;nbsp;km (1.2 to 2.1&amp;nbsp;mi) long. Currently, only the Mexico City ePrix takes place on a road course, a modified version of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.

===Environmental benefits of the use of electric vehicles===
Electric vehicles produce no [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions, at the tailpipe.
So they are considered 'green' because they have no emissions in the place where they are used.
However, battery electric vehicles can be considered [[Zero emission engines]] only locally, because they generally produce GHG in the power plants where electricity is generated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-exec-summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
The two factors driving these GHG emissions of Battery Electric Vehicles are:
* the Carbon intensity of the electricity used to recharge the Electric Vehicle (commonly expressed in grams of CO2 per kWh)
* the consumption of the specific vehicle (in kilometers/kWh)
The Carbon Intensity of electricity can largely vary, depending on the electricity mix of the geographic region where electricity is consumed (a Country with high shares of renewables in his electricity mix will have a low C.I.).
In the European Union, in 2013, the Carbon Intensity had a strong geographic variability, but in almost all the Member States Electric vehicles were "greener" than conventional ones. On average, Electric car saved 50%-60% of CO2 emissions compared to diesel and gasoline fuelled engines. 
Moreover, the de-carbonisation process is constantly reducing the GHG emissions due to the use of Electric Vehicles. In the European Union, on average, between 2009 and 2013 there was a reduction of the electricity Carbon Intensity of 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Lonza L|title=Electricity carbon intensity in European Member States: Impacts on GHG emissions of electric vehicles|journal=Transportation Research part D, 2017|doi=10.1016/j.trd.2017.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Life-cycle assessment]] perspective, considering the GHG necessary to build the battery and its end-of-life, the GHG savings are 10-13% lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Helmers E|title=A new hybrid method for reducing the gap between WTW and LCA in the carbon footprint assessment of electric vehicles|journal=Int J Life Cycle Assess (2017) 22: 4|doi=10.1007/s11367-015-0954-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special-purpose vehicles===

[[Special-purpose vehicle]]s come in a wide range of types, ranging from relatively common ones such as [[golf cart]]s, things like [[electric golf trolley]]s, [[milk float]]s, [[all-terrain vehicle]]s, [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s, and a wide range of other devices. Certain manufacturers specialize in electric-powered "in plant" work machines.

===Electric motorcycles, scooters and rickshaws===

===Motor controllers===
{{Main|Motor controller}}
The motor controller receives a signal from [[potentiometers]] linked to the accelerator pedal, and it uses this signal to determine how much electric power is needed&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork"&gt;{{cite web |title=How Exactly Do Electric Cars Work? |url=https://www.greencarfuture.com/electric/2018/11/11/how-exactly-do-electric-cars-work.html|website=Green Car Future |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This [[DC power]] is supplied by the battery pack, and the controller regulates the power to the motor, supplying either variable pulse width DC or variable frequency variable amplitude AC, depending on the motor type. The controller also handles [[regenerative braking]], whereby electrical power is gathered as the vehicle slows down and this power recharges the battery&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;. In addition to power and motor management, the controller performs various safety checks such as anomaly detection, functional safety tests and failure diagnostics&lt;ref name="HitachiReview"&gt;{{cite web |title=Components and Systems for Electric Vehicles (HEVs/EVs) |url=http://www.hitachi.com/rev/archive/2018/r2018_01/10b02/index.html|website=Hitachi Review |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.


===Battery Pack===
{{main|Battery (electricity)}}

Most electric vehicles today use an [[electric battery]], consisting of [[electrochemical cell]]s with external connections in order to provide power to the vehicle.&lt;ref name=battRef2000&gt;
{{cite book |title=Battery Reference Book |edition=third|last=Crompton|first=T. R. |date=2000-03-20 |publisher=Newnes |page=Glossary 3 |isbn=0080499953 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=QmVR7qiB5AUC&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;ots=ckHhIPVdcC&amp;dq=battery%20one%20or%20more%20cells&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2016-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Battery technology for EVs has developed from early [[lead-acid batteries]] used in the late 19th Century to the 2010s, to [[lithium-ion batteries]] which are found in most EVs today&lt;ref name="HitachiReview" /&gt;. The overall battery is referred to as a [[battery pack]], which is a group of multiple battery modules and cells. The battery pack powering modern EVs can have as little as 96 battery cells to as many as 2,976 cells&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;.

===Motors===
{{Main|Traction motor}}
Electric cars have traditionally used series wound DC motors, a form of [[brushed DC electric motor]]. Separately excited and permanent magnet are just two of the types of DC motors available. More recent electric vehicles have made use of a variety of [[AC motor]] types, as these are simpler to build and have no brushes that can wear out. These are usually [[induction motor]]s or [[brushless AC electric motor]]s which use permanent magnets. There are several variations of the permanent magnet motor which offer simpler drive schemes and/or lower cost including the [[brushless DC electric motor]].

Once electric power is supplied to the motor (from the controller), the magnetic field interaction inside the motor will turn the [[drive shaft]] and ultimately the vehicle's wheels&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;.

In [[linguistics]], a '''binomial pair''' or '''binomial''' is a sequence of two or more words or phrases belonging to the same grammatical category, having some semantic relationship and joined by some syntactic device such as ''and'' or ''or''. Examples in English include ''through and through'', ''(without) let or hindrance'', and ''chalk and cheese''.

Several [[legal term]]s are binomial pairs, often (but not necessarily) consisting of one [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word and one [[Romance languages|Romance]] word, such as ''(last) will and testament'' or ''cease and desist''.

Binomials are often irreversible; that is, they occur only in one order. For example, one says ''bow and arrow'' but not ''*arrow and bow''; one says ''here and there'' and ''that's neither here nor there'', but not ''*there and here'' or ''*that's neither there nor here''.

'''Clarion West Writers Workshop''' is an intensive six-week program for writers preparing for professional careers in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]. It runs annually from late June through the end of July. The workshop is limited to 18 students per year. Each of the six weeks is instructed by a different professional writer or editor. The roster of guest instructors changes yearly. Founded in [[Seattle]], Washington in 1971, the workshop has been held continuously since 1984. Clarion West celebrated its 25th anniversary of continuous instruction in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;"Clarion West Turns 25". Locus Magazine, September 2008: Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clarion West board of directors currently includes Karen G. Anderson, Kelley Eskridge, Tod McCoy, Jeffrey Lemkin, Felicia Gonzalez, Phoebe Harris, V.N. Saunders, and Nisi Shawl.

== History ==

The 1971 Clarion West Writers Workshop was founded by [[Vonda N. McIntyre]], a [[Clarion Workshop]] graduate and [[Nebula Award|Nebula]] and [[Hugo Award]]-winning author, with the support of original Clarion founder [[Robin Scott Wilson]]. It was modeled after the original Clarion Workshop founded in 1968 at [[Clarion University of Pennsylvania]] (itself inspired by the [[Milford Writer's Workshop]]). The original Clarion Workshop was slated to close after holding final classes in 1970, and the effort was made to establish and continue Clarion workshops in other locations. The 1971 successor workshops that sprang from this effort were Clarion West Workshop founded in Seattle, and [[Clarion Workshop]] revived in New Orleans (later moved to Michigan in 1972, and San Diego in 2007). Clarion West operated until 1973, before a hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhem, Kate.  ''Storyteller: Writing Lessons and More from 27 Years of the Clarion Writers' Workshop'', Small Beer Press, Easthampton, MA 2005 {{ISBN|978-1-931520-16-4}}: Pages 32-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Clarion West graduate J.T. Stewart and Seattle writer, Marilyn J. Holt, reconvened the workshop with the support of founder [[Vonda N. McIntyre]]. Clarion West incorporated as a nonprofit organization with a board of directors in 1986 with the help of many dedicated Clarion West alumni. Currently the workshop is administered by [[Neile Graham]] and Huw Evans.  Although the workshop is located in close proximity to the [[University of Washington]], it is not associated with the university. It has operated continuously to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;About Clarion West: http://www.clarionwest.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workshop format ==

The workshop is combination of instruction and mutual student critique using the Clarion Method. The emphasis of learning is primarily geared toward hours spent reading, writing and critiquing.  Normally, students are expected to write one complete draft of a story per week, to be critiqued the following week. Ideas for these stories are up to the student, but the emphasis is that the writing takes place on premises where fresh lessons and insight can be immediately applied to new story ideas. Work on 'trunk' stories, written before the workshop, is discouraged.

The class lecture and critique runs weekdays from morning to early afternoon. The remainder of the day is typically divided between writing for the next week's story deadline, reading, and preparing critiques. The workload is intense, but breaks and socializing are typical at all hours. Weekends are free time to socialize, explore the local sights, and catch up on unfinished writing and reading.

Each student typically gets a weekly private conference with each instructor to ask questions and gain insight from that professional writer or editor.

Although the focus of the workshop is on [[speculative fiction]], such as [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]], other genres, including [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[comedy]], [[Mystery (fiction)|mystery]], and [[fiction|literary]] writing (and mixtures thereof) regularly grace the workshop stories. The workshop focuses on writing and critiquing [[short story|short stories]], but many aspects of [[novel]] writing are also discussed in workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Clarion West Introductory Information for Students Handout, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extracurricular activities ==

The speculative fiction community around the Seattle area has built support for the workshop over the years, and many special events have become part of the Clarion West tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Howle, Leslie. "Twenty Five Years of Clarion West". Seventh Week, Fall 2008: Pages 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

*Clarion West Parties: These invitation-only events are attended by the students and administrators, graduated alumni, and many established writers, editors, agents, and fans in the industry.  
* Readings and Book Signings: These public events allow students and the public to experience readings by the instructing writers.  They are regularly hosted by the local [[University Book Store]].&lt;ref&gt;University Book Store : http://www.ubookstore.com/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame]]/[[Locus Award]]s weekend: frequently the workshop coincides with the yearly Locus Awards and Science Fiction Hall of Fame weekend events. This is a chance for students to participate in events that typically draw writers and professionals from around the globe.

== Traditions ==

There are a number of class traditions passed down from one class to the next in the manner of a secret society. Traditions that are publicly known include the yearly Clarion West class shirt (designed by the class and limited only to the classmates and instructors of that year),&lt;ref&gt;Example of a Clarion West class shirt, 2004: https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/343613/&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice of presenting unusual gifts to each of the instructors.  Classes often come up with new traditions and items to pass on to the next year's class.

== Applications ==

Space in the workshop is awarded to the top 18 applicants of all submissions received. The average number of applications is not disclosed and varies year to year.

The application window typically opens January 1 and runs through March 1 for the year attending. Students are usually selected and informed of acceptance by the end of March.&lt;ref&gt;Workshop Application Guidelines: http://www.clarionwest.org/workshop/apply&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Clarion West, [[Clarion Workshop|Clarion]], and Clarion South are run independently, they follow the same workshop method and are considered sister schools. Since both Clarion West and Clarion workshops run concurrently, students are often encouraged to apply to both workshops to increase their chances of attending that year. Students accepted to both programs must choose their preferred workshop. Each of the schools has similar but distinct guidelines.

Students that graduate one of the Clarion workshops are considered alumni of all the Clarion programs, and may not re-apply for any other Clarion Workshop.

{{for|clausula in medieval music|Clausula (music)}}

In Roman rhetoric, a '''clausula''' /'klɔːzi̯ʊlə/ (Latin "little close or conclusion"; plural ''clausulae'' /'klɔːzi̯ʊli/) was a [[Foot (prosody)|rhythmic figure]] used to add finesse and finality to the end of a sentence or phrase. There was a large range of popular clausulae. Most well known is the classically Ciceronian ''esse videatur'' type.

Every long sentence can be divided into rhythmical ''cola'' (singular ''colon''), in Latin ''membra'' (singular ''membrum''), and the last few syllables of every colon tend to conform to certain favourite rhythmic patterns, which are known as ''clausulae''.&lt;ref&gt;Habinek (1985), pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter ''cola'' were known as ''commata'' /ˈkɒmətə/ (singular ''comma''), in Latin ''incisa'' (singular ''incisum''), which also often display rhythmic endings.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham (1957), p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clausulae in Cicero's speeches==

The constant use of clausulae in Cicero's speeches was first thoroughly investigated by the Polish philologist [[Tadeusz Stefan Zieliński|Tadeusz Zieliński]] in a monumental work published in German in 1904, following an earlier dissertation by G. Wüst in 1881 and work by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905).&lt;/ref&gt; Zieliński established that a Ciceronian clausula had two parts: a "base", generally a cretic | – u – | or a variation on it, and a "cadence", generally of a [[trochee|trochaic]] rhythm such as | – x |, | – u x |, or | – u – x |.&lt;ref name=Sre150&gt;Srebrny (1947 (2013)), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; (Here "–" indicates a long syllable, "u" a short syllable, and "x" a syllable which can be either long or short.)

The most common clausulae in Cicero are the following:&lt;ref&gt;Berry (1996), pp. 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*| – u – | – x | and variations (32.4% of Cicero's clausulae)
*| – x – | – u x | (24.4%)
*| – x – | – u – x | (30.1%)

Variations may include resolving one of the long syllables in the rhythm into two short ones, for example | – u uu | – x | (''esse videatur'') instead of | – u – | – x |. Another type of allowable variation is to substitute | – uu – | or | – u – – | for the base.&lt;ref name=Cla167&gt;Clark (1905), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The above clausulae account for about 87% of Cicero's clausulae. Other clausulae are rarer. For example, the cadence may have five elements | – u – u – | or consist of two [[spondee]]s | – – – – |. This last type (commoner in Livy than in Cicero) is compared by Zieliński to the blows of a hammer.&lt;ref name=Cla167 /&gt; Certain clausulae, such as the [[hexameter]] ending | – u u | – x |, were avoided (it occurs in Cicero, but only in about 0.6% of cases, and often for a reason such a mock-heroic description).&lt;ref&gt;Berry (1996), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Zieliński noted that Cicero's preferences changed gradually over the years. For example, the rhythm | – – – | – u x | was more common in his earlier speeches, while from his consulate onwards he preferred the lighter | – u – | – u x |.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Zieliński, it is a principle of clausulae that the word-accent tends to follow the ictus of the feet, that is, there is usually an accent on the first syllable of the base and on the penultimate long syllable of the cadence, e.g. ''ílla tempéstas'', ''egéstas audácia'', ''incéndium civitátis'', ''Cáesari d(e) eius áctis'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are often exceptions to this rule, and Cicero was not so strict as later writers such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Arnobius]].&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Dennison (1970), §16, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no doubt that the skilful use of clausulae was one of the techniques which an orator used to excite an audience. Cicero writes of one occasion when the use of a certain clausula (a dichoreus or double [[trochee]] – u – x) by the orator [[Gnaeus Papirius Carbo|Carbo the Younger]] was so effective that the audience all gave a shout.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Orator'' 214; cf. Adams (2013), p. 8; Cunningham (1957), p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples from Cicero==
An example of Cicero's use of clausulae in a speech is given below, with the two sentences divided into cola:&lt;ref&gt;Grillo (2015), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
::Ecce '''ílla tempéstas''', | – u – | – – | 
::cālīgo bonorum et subita atque impro'''vísa formído''', | – u – | – – | 
::téne'''brae rei públicae''', | – u – | – u – |
::ruina atque in'''céndium civitátis''', | – u – | – u – – | 
::terror iniectus '''Cáesari d(e) eius áctis''', | – u – | – u – – |
::metus cáe'''dis bonis ómnibus''', | – u – | – u – | 
::consulum scelus, cupiditas, e'''géstas, audácia'''! | – – – | – u – |
 
::Si non sum ad'''iútus, non débui'''; | – – – | – u – |
::si desertus, sibi for'''tásse provídit'''; | – u – | – – |
::si etiam oppugnatus, ut quid(am) '''áut putant áut volunt''', | – u – | – u – |
::vio'''lát(a) amicítia (e)st''', | – u – | uu – | 
::'''áccep(i) iniúriam'''; | – – – | – u – | 
::inimicus esse '''débui, nón nego'''. | – u – | – u – |&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Provinciis consularibus'', 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Behold that storm, the gloom of good men and a sudden and unforeseen fear, the darkness of the republic, the ruin and conflagration of the state, terror given to Caesar concerning his acts, fear of slaughter for all good men, the wickedness, greed, indigence, and audacity of the consuls! If I was not helped, I did not deserve it; if I was deserted, perhaps he was providing for his own safety; if I was even attacked, as certain people either think or wish, our friendship was violated, I received an injury; I should have been his enemy, I do not deny it."

The "heroic clausula" (– uu – x), which resembles a hexameter ending, is rare but can be used for comic effect, as in the following quotation from ''pro Caelio'':&lt;ref&gt;''pro Caelio'' §63; cf. Adams (2013), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
::In '''bálneis delituérunt''': | – u – | – uu – – |
::'''téstis egrégios'''! | – – – | uu – |
::'''Déin temerē prósiluérunt''': | – uu – | – uu – – |
::'''homines témperántis'''! | uu – | – u – – |

:"They hid in the baths. Outstanding witnesses! Then they rashly leapt out. Cool-headed men!"

As Adams points out, the passage is made even more funny by the pun on ''testes'', which can mean "testicles" as well as "witnesses".

The following passage from the 2nd Catilinarian oration shows some of the less commonly used cadences, including the five-syllable | – u – u – | and the "hammer-blow" spondaic | – – – – |:&lt;ref&gt;''in Catilinam'' 6; cf. Riggsby (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; 
::Non est iam '''lénitatí locus'''; | – u – | – u – |
::severi'''tátem res ípsa flágitat'''. | – – – | – u – u – |
::'''Ún(um) etiam núnc concédam''': | – uu – | – – – – |
::exe'''ánt, proficiscántur'''; | – uu – | – – |
::ne patiantur desiderio sui Catilinam '''míserum tabéscere'''. | uu – – | – u – |
::Demons'''tráb(o) iter: Auréliā viā proféctus est'''; | – uu – | – u – u – u – u – |
::si accelerare volent, ad '''vésperam cónsequéntur'''. | – u – | – u – – |

:"There is no place for leniency any longer; the situation itself calls for severity. But one thing I will concede even now: let them go out, let them depart; let them not allow Catiline to pine away miserably with desire for them. I will show them the route: he departed by the Aurelian Way. If they are willing to hurry, by evening they will catch up with him."

It is characteristic of the emphatic spondaic ending (– – – –) that in Cicero there is always a word-break between the base and the cadence. With the clausula – u – – x on the other hand, as in ''illa tempestas'', the most usual place for a word-break is after the second syllable.&lt;ref name="Cla167"/&gt;

The following passage from the ''pro Scauro'' is analysed explicitly by Cicero himself into four ''incisa'' (commata), followed by two ''membra'' (cola), and then a long spondaic period ending in a ''dichoreus'' or double trochee:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Orator'' 222–26; analysed in Cunningham (1957), pp. 499–500.&lt;/ref&gt;
::do'''mús tibi déerat'''? at habébas. | u | – u – | – – || uu – – |
::pe'''cúnia superábat'''? at egébas. | u | – u uu | – – || uu – – |
::incur'''ríst(i) amens ín colúmnas''', | – – | – – – | – u – – |
::in alienos in'''sánus insanísti'''; | u u u – – – | – u – | – – – |
::depressam, cae'''cám, iacentém domum''' | – – – – | – u – | – u – |
::pluris quam t(e) et quam fortu'''nás tuas áestimásti'''. | – – – – – – – | – u – | – u – – |

:"Did you lack a house? No, you already had one. Did you have enough money? No, you didn't have any. You ran madly into the columns, you raged crazily against other people's slaves; you reckoned a decrepit, dark, fallen down house as worth more than yourself and your fortunes."

Cicero comments that the ''incisa'' (commata), because of their shortness, are rather freer in their rhythm, and should be used "like little daggers". The rhythmical period (''numerosa comprehensio''), he says, is a longer sentence composed of at least two cola, and is more sparingly used. The style which consists of a mixture of commata, cola, and the occasional longer period is particularly effective, he says, in passages arguing a case or refuting one.

==Clausulae in other writers==
Clausulae are found not only in Cicero but in many Roman (as well as Greek and medieval) writers, especially in oratory but also in other types of writing. Each writer has their own preferences and "rhythmic signature".&lt;ref name=Sre150 /&gt; For example, Livy avoids clausulae which are common in Cicero, such as | – u – | – x |, but frequently ends a sentence with a series of long syllables, for example ''legati Roman(i) occurrērunt''.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), pp. 167, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest orator to make extensive use of rhythmic prose in Greek is said to have been the sophist [[Thrasymachus]] of Chalcedon (the same person who appears as a speaker in book 1 of Plato's ''Republic'').&lt;ref name=Cla164&gt;Clark (1905), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] himself favoured the clausulae | – u – | – u x |, | – – – | – u x |, and | – u u | – u x |, among others. His preferences changed in the course of his life, and he used | u u u x | and | – u u u – x | more often in the later works.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lysias]], [[Aeschines]], [[Isaeus]], [[Plutarch]] and others also had their own preferences. Clausulae are prominent in the orations of [[Demosthenes]], especially the ditrochaeus (– u – x), dispondaeus (– – – x), cretic + trochee (– u – – x), and choriamb + trochee (– uu – – x).&lt;ref name=Cla164 /&gt; But his most characteristic practice (known as "Blass's Law") is to avoid series of more than three short syllables anywhere in his sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §10.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers such as [[Thucydides]], wrote prose almost free of rhythmical influence, however.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin, rhythmical prose was characteristic of the so-called "Asiatic" style of oratory, whereas followers of the plainer "Attic" style avoided it.&lt;ref name="Cla164"/&gt; The younger [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Suetonius]], [[Apuleius]] and [[Tertullian]] more or less followed the Ciceronian pattern, though several writers avoided | – – – | – u x | and the famous ''esse videatur'' clausula, as being overly Ciceronian.&lt;ref name=Cla164 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §17f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval clausulae (''cursus'')==

In the medieval period, Latin ceased to be pronounced in a quantitative way, and clausulae tended to be accentual rather than based on quantity. Three end-of-sentence rhythms were especially favoured, the so called ''planus'' (– x x – x) (where – indicates an accented syllable and x an unaccented one), the ''tardus'' (– x x – x x), and the ''velox'' (– x x x x – x). These rhythms are found for example in the writings of [[Gregory of Tours]] (6th century), [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and [[Héloïse]] (12th century), and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] (13th-14th century).&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §21.&lt;/ref&gt; They are known to modern scholars (although apparently not to the medieval writers themselves) as ''cursus''. However, not all writers made use of them.&lt;ref&gt;Tunberg (1996), pp. 114-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The professors of the period specified that the last word of the sentence had to be of either three or four syllables.&lt;ref&gt;Tunberg (1996), pp. 115-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient writers on clausulae==
The first writer to mention rhythm in prose is [[Aristotle]] in his ''Ars Rhetorica''; he says that prose should not be entirely metrical, like poetry, but also not unrhythmical either.&lt;ref&gt;1408b; cf. Adams (2013), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero himself discusses the use of clausulae in his books on oratory, especially in ''[[de Oratore]]'' 173-198, and ''[[Orator]]'' 204-226.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), pp. 164-5; Adams (2013), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terentianus|Terentianus Maurus]] (c. 290 AD) also discusses clausulae in a work itself written in verse. He says of the cretic (– u –) that it is the best kind of foot, especially when used in penultimate position before a dactyl (– u x).&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher of rhetoric [[Quintilian]] treats clausulae at length, especially in books 5 and 9; like Terentianus, he approves of the double cretic | – u – | – u x |,&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian 9.4.107; Clark (1905), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; but recommends avoiding the heroic clausula | – x – | – uu – x |, since it too much resembles the end of a line of verse.&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian 9.4.102; Clark (1905), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of clausula-study==
The analysis of a piece of Latin into cola and clausulae can not only of help the modern student to read the passage with authentic phrasing, but also is a useful tool in investigating an author's style. So, for example, Riggsby notes that the cola in the earlier part of the 2nd Catilinarian oration are shorter, and the clausulae more varied, than in the last paragraph. He takes this as an indication of Cicero's shift in emphasis from chaos and danger to peace and resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Riggsby (2010), pp. 101-102; cf. Adams (2013), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the clausulae will throw light on the writer's choice of word, tense or word order.&lt;ref name=Cla171&gt;Clark (1905), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''patent portae, proficiscere!''&lt;ref&gt;''In Catilinam'' 1.10.&lt;/ref&gt; "the gates are open; depart!" makes an effective clausula, whereas *''portae patent, proficiscere'' does not. Clausulae can also help editors decide which of two manuscript readings is the correct one, or whether an editor's conjecture is acceptable.&lt;ref name=Cla170&gt;Clark (1905), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clausulae have sometimes helped editors to decide on the authenticity or otherwise of a work. For example, the speech ''de domo sua'', whose authorship was once in doubt, has been shown to exhibit exactly the same proportions of clausulae as Cicero's other speeches.&lt;ref name=Cla171 /&gt; In the case of authors whose practice varied over the years, such as Plato, clausulae analysis can throw light on the date of a work.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §22.&lt;/ref&gt;

From examining the clausulae it is sometimes possible to uncover the exact pronunciation of individual words by a particular author. For example, it appears that Cicero pronounced ''redduco'' "I bring back" and ''relliquus'' "remaining" with a long first syllable, as did [[Lucretius]].&lt;ref name=Cla170 /&gt; ''Nōn modō'' "not only" was pronounced with the last vowel long. For ordinary nouns ending in ''-ium'' or ''-ius'', the genitive ''-i'' was preferred by Cicero (e.g. ''iudici'' "of the trial"), although in proper names such as ''Clodii'' "of Clodius" the ending "-ii" was often used. In ''nil'' and ''nihil'' "nothing" and ''periculum'' and ''periclum'' "danger" both forms occur.&lt;ref name=Cla170 /&gt; In the future perfect tense, as in ''fecerīmus'' "we'll have made", it appears that Cicero, contrary to the rule given in some grammars such as Kennedy,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, B. ''Revised Latin Primer'', 1962 ed. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; pronounced the "i" long, as did his contemporary [[Catullus]].&lt;ref&gt;Fordyce, C.J. (1961) ''Catullus: A commentary'', note on 5.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the discipline|the journal|Communication Theory (journal)}}
'''Communication theory''' is a field of [[information theory]] and [[mathematics]] that studies the technical process of information&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Mathematical Theory of Communication |last=Shannon |first=Claude Elwood |date=2011 |origyear=July and October 1948 |publisher=The Bell System Technical Journal |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=55 |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the process of [[human communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Applying Communication Theory for Professional Life |last=Dainton |first=Marianne |authorlink= |author2=Elain D. Zellei |year=2011 |publisher= Sage Publications |location= |isbn=1-4129-7691-X |page= |pages=247 |url= http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/4983_Dainton_Chapter_1.pdf |accessdate= November 4, 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally communication theory is “any systematic summary about the nature of the communication process” (Dainton, 2019). It “is a coherent field of metadiscursive practice, a field of discourse about discourse with implications for the practice of communication” (Craig, 1999, pg. 120) and seeks to “provide conceptual resources for reflecting on communication problems” (p. 130).

== History ==
{{Main|A Mathematical Theory of Communication|Jakobson's functions of language|Outline of communication|Harold Innis's communications theories}}

=== Origins ===
"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; [[Claude Shannon]] (1916–2001)

The origins of communication theory is linked to the development of [[information theory]] in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Management Effectiveness and Communication, MBA 665, Online Resources, Communication Models |year=2008 |publisher=Bob Jones University |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.shkaminski.com/Classes/Handouts/Communication%20Models.htm |accessdate= November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at [[Bell Labs]], all implicitly assuming events of equal probability.

[[Harry Nyquist]]'s 1924 paper, ''Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed'', contains a theoretical section quantifying "intelligence" and the "line speed" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system.

[[Ralph Hartley]]'s 1928 paper, ''Transmission of Information,'' uses the word "information" as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other. The natural unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, much later renamed the [[Hartley (unit)|hartley]] in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information.

[[Alan Turing]] in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma]] ciphers.

The main landmark event that opened the way to the development of communication theory was the publication of an article by [[Claude Shannon]] in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'' in July and October 1948 under the title "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]".&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; Shannon focused on the problem of how best to encode the information that a sender wants to transmit. He also used tools in [[probability theory]], developed by [[Norbert Wiener]]. They marked the nascent stages of applied communication theory at that time. Shannon developed [[information entropy]] as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory.

In 1949, in a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of [[cryptography]] ("[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]"), he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the [[one-time pad]]. He is also credited with the introduction of [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|sampling theory]], which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later.

In 1951, Shannon made his fundamental contribution to [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]] with his article "Prediction and Entropy of Printed English" (1951), providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.

=== Models of communication ===
{{Main|Models of communication}}

The studies on information theory by Claude Elwood Shannon, [[Warren Weaver]] and others, prompted research on new [[Conceptual model|models]] of communication from other scientific perspectives like [[psychology]] and sociology. In science, a model is a structure that represents a theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Models in Science |last=Frigg, Roman and [[Stephan Hartmann|Hartmann, Stephan]] |first= |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/#ModThe |accessdate= November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars from disciplines different from [[mathematics]] and engineering began to take distance from the Shannon and Weaver models as a 'transmissible model':

{{Quotation|They developed a model of communication which was intended to assist in developing a mathematical theory of communication. Shannon and Weaver's work proved valuable for communication engineers in dealing with such issues as the capacity of various communication channels in 'bits per second'. It contributed to computer science. It led to very useful work on redundancy in language. And in making 'information' 'measurable' it gave birth to the mathematical study of 'information theory'|[[Daniel Chandler|D. Chandler]]|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Transmission Model of Communication |last=Chandler |first=Daniel |year=1994 |publisher=University of Western Australia |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/trans.html |accessdate= November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Robert T. Craig in his foundational publication, ''Communication Theory as a Field'' (1999), communication theory “consist of seven traditions that are […] characteristic of the field: rhetoric, semiotics, phenomenology, cybernetics, sociopsychology, sociocultural theory, and the critical approach.”

"Communication is a process of expression, interaction, and influence, in which the behavior of humans or other complex organisms expresses psychological mechanisms, states, and traits and, through interaction with the similar expressions of other individuals, produces a range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral effects.” (Craig, 1999, p. 143)

== Elements of communication ==

Basic elements of communication made the object of study of the communication theory:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Communication process |publisher=Center for Literacy Studies of the University of Tennessee |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.cls.utk.edu/pdf/ls/Week1_Lesson7.pdf |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Communication source|Source]]''': Shannon calls this element the "information source", which "produces a message or sequence of messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Sender''': Shannon calls this element the "transmitter", which "operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for transmission over the channel."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; In Aristotle, this element is the "speaker" (orator).&lt;ref name="Rhetoric"&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Rhetoric: Comprising an Analysis of the Laws of Moral Evidence |author1=Richard Whately |author2=Douglas Ehninger |author3=David Potter |year=1963 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8093-2974-8 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYbgnLDdOkQC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Ehninger,+Aristotles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bkxHTlw9DZ&amp;sig=YdmF1zKKM74WOgoI_0jvYq6kUpo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Hku3TsybFoGviQf7of2bAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Channel''': For Shannon, the channel is "merely the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Receiver''': For Shannon, the receiver "performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Destination''': For Shannon, the destination is "the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended".&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Message''': from [[Latin]] ''mittere'', "to send". The message is a [[concept]], information, communication, or [[:wikt:statement|statement]] that is sent in a verbal, written, recorded, or visual form to the recipient.
* '''Feedback'''
* '''Entropic elements, positive and negative'''

'''Computational phylogenetics''' is the application of computational [[algorithm]]s, methods, and programs to [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analyses. The goal is to assemble a [[phylogenetic tree]] representing a hypothesis about the evolutionary ancestry of a set of [[gene]]s, [[species]], or other [[taxa]]. For example, these techniques have been used to explore the family tree of [[hominid]] species&lt;ref name="Strait"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strait | first1 = DS | last2 = Grine | first2 = FE | year = 2004 | title = Inferring hominoid and early hominid phylogeny using craniodental characters: the role of fossil taxa | url = | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 47 | issue = 6| pages = 399–452 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.08.008 | pmid=15566946}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the relationships between specific genes shared by many types of organisms.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hodge | first1 = T | last2 = Cope | first2 = MJ | year = 2000 | title = A myosin family tree | url = | journal = J Cell Sci | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 3353–3354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional phylogenetics relies on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] data obtained by measuring and quantifying the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] properties of representative organisms, while the more recent field of molecular phylogenetics uses [[nucleotide]] sequences encoding genes or [[amino acid]] sequences encoding [[protein]]s as the basis for classification. Many forms of molecular phylogenetics are closely related to and make extensive use of [[sequence alignment]] in constructing and refining phylogenetic trees, which are used to classify the evolutionary relationships between homologous [[gene]]s represented in the [[genome]]s of divergent species. The phylogenetic trees constructed by computational methods are unlikely to perfectly reproduce the [[evolutionary tree]] that represents the historical relationships between the species being analyzed. The historical species tree may also differ from the historical tree of an individual homologous gene shared by those species.

==Types of phylogenetic trees and networks==
[[Phylogenetic tree]]s generated by computational phylogenetics can be either ''rooted'' or ''unrooted'' depending on the input data and the algorithm used. A rooted tree is a [[directed graph]] that explicitly identifies a [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA), usually an imputed sequence that is not represented in the input. Genetic distance measures can be used to plot a tree with the input sequences as [[leaf node]]s and their distances from the root proportional to their [[genetic distance]] from the hypothesized MRCA. Identification of a root usually requires the inclusion in the input data of at least one "outgroup" known to be only distantly related to the sequences of interest.

By contrast, unrooted trees plot the distances and relationships between input sequences without making assumptions regarding their descent. An unrooted tree can always be produced from a rooted tree, but a root cannot usually be placed on an unrooted tree without additional data on divergence rates, such as the assumption of the [[molecular clock]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name="mount"&gt;Mount DM. (2004). ''Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis'' 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: Cold Spring Harbor, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of all possible phylogenetic trees for a given group of input sequences can be conceptualized as a discretely defined multidimensional "tree space" through which search paths can be traced by [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] algorithms. Although counting the total number of trees for a nontrivial number of input sequences can be complicated by variations in the definition of a tree topology, it is always true that there are more rooted than unrooted trees for a given number of inputs and choice of parameters.&lt;ref name="felsenstein"&gt;Felsenstein J. (2004). ''Inferring Phylogenies'' Sinauer Associates: Sunderland, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees can be further generalized to rooted or unrooted [[phylogenetic network]]s, which allow for the modeling of evolutionary phenomena such as [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridization]] or [[horizontal gene transfer]].

==Coding characters and defining homology==
===Morphological analysis===
The basic problem in morphological phylogenetics is the assembly of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] representing a mapping from each of the taxa being compared to representative measurements for each of the phenotypic characteristics being used as a classifier. The types of phenotypic data used to construct this matrix depend on the taxa being compared; for individual species, they may involve measurements of average body size, lengths or sizes of particular bones or other physical features, or even behavioral manifestations. Of course, since not every possible phenotypic characteristic could be measured and encoded for analysis, the selection of which features to measure is a major inherent obstacle to the method. The decision of which traits to use as a basis for the matrix necessarily represents a hypothesis about which traits of a species or higher taxon are evolutionarily relevant.&lt;ref name="Swiderski"&gt;Swiderski DL, Zelditch ML, Fink WL. (1998). Why morphometrics is not special: coding quantitative data for phylogenetic analysis. 47(3):508-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Morphological studies can be confounded by examples of [[convergent evolution]] of phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Gaubert"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaubert | first1 = P | last2 = Wozencraft | first2 = WC | last3 = Cordeiro-Estrela | first3 = P | last4 = Veron | first4 = G | year = 2005 | title = Mosaics of convergences and noise in morphological phylogenies: what's in a viverrid-like carnivoran? | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 54 | issue = 6| pages = 865–894 | doi=10.1080/10635150500232769| pmid = 16282167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major challenge in constructing useful classes is the high likelihood of inter-taxon overlap in the distribution of the phenotype's variation. The inclusion of extinct taxa in morphological analysis is often difficult due to absence of or incomplete [[fossil]] records, but has been shown to have a significant effect on the trees produced; in one study only the inclusion of extinct species of [[ape]]s produced a morphologically derived tree that was consistent with that produced from molecular data.&lt;ref name="Strait" /&gt;

Some phenotypic classifications, particularly those used when analyzing very diverse groups of taxa, are discrete and unambiguous; classifying organisms as possessing or lacking a tail, for example, is straightforward in the majority of cases, as is counting features such as eyes or vertebrae. However, the most appropriate representation of continuously varying phenotypic measurements is a controversial problem without a general solution. A common method is simply to sort the measurements of interest into two or more classes, rendering continuous observed variation as discretely classifiable (e.g., all examples with humerus bones longer than a given cutoff are scored as members of one state, and all members whose humerus bones are shorter than the cutoff are scored as members of a second state). This results in an easily manipulated [[data set]] but has been criticized for poor reporting of the basis for the class definitions and for sacrificing information compared to methods that use a continuous weighted distribution of measurements.&lt;ref name="Wiens"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiens | first1 = JJ | year = 2001 | title = Character analysis in morphological phylogenetics: problems and solutions | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 689–699 | doi=10.1080/106351501753328811| pmid = 12116939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because morphological data is extremely labor-intensive to collect, whether from literature sources or from field observations, reuse of previously compiled data matrices is not uncommon, although this may propagate flaws in the original matrix into multiple derivative analyses.&lt;ref name="Jenner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jenner | first1 = RA | year = 2001 | title = Bilaterian phylogeny and uncritical recycling of morphological data sets | url = | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 730–743 | doi=10.1080/106351501753328857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular analysis===
The problem of character coding is very different in molecular analyses, as the characters in biological sequence data are immediate and discretely defined - distinct [[nucleotide]]s in [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] sequences and distinct [[amino acid]]s in [[protein]] sequences. However, defining [[homology (biology)|homology]] can be challenging due to the inherent difficulties of [[multiple sequence alignment]]. For a given gapped MSA, several rooted phylogenetic trees can be constructed that vary in their interpretations of which changes are "[[mutation]]s" versus ancestral characters, and which events are [[insertion (genetics)|insertion mutations]] or [[deletion (genetics)|deletion mutations]]. For example, given only a pairwise alignment with a gap region, it is impossible to determine whether one sequence bears an insertion mutation or the other carries a deletion. The problem is magnified in MSAs with unaligned and nonoverlapping gaps. In practice, sizable regions of a calculated alignment may be discounted in phylogenetic tree construction to avoid integrating noisy data into the tree calculation.
&lt;!-- more here on the effects of mutation rates--&gt;

==Distance-matrix methods==
{{Main|Distance matrices in phylogeny}}
Distance-matrix methods of phylogenetic analysis explicitly rely on a measure of "genetic distance" between the sequences being classified, and therefore they require an MSA as an input. Distance is often defined as the fraction of mismatches at aligned positions, with gaps either ignored or counted as mismatches.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; Distance methods attempt to construct an all-to-all matrix from the sequence query set describing the distance between each sequence pair. From this is constructed a phylogenetic tree that places closely related sequences under the same [[interior node]] and whose branch lengths closely reproduce the observed distances between sequences. Distance-matrix methods may produce either rooted or unrooted trees, depending on the algorithm used to calculate them. They are frequently used as the basis for progressive and iterative types of [[multiple sequence alignment]]s. The main disadvantage of distance-matrix methods is their inability to efficiently use information about local high-variation regions that appear across multiple subtrees.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===UPGMA and WPGMA===
{{Main|UPGMA}}
{{Main|WPGMA}}

The [[UPGMA]] (''Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean'') and [[WPGMA]] (''Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean'') methods produce rooted trees and require a constant-rate assumption - that is, it assumes an [[ultrametric]] tree in which the distances from the root to every branch tip are equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sokal R and Michener C |title=A statistical method for evaluating systematic relationships |journal=University of Kansas Science Bulletin |volume=38 |pages=1409–1438 |year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neighbor-joining===
{{Main|Neighbor joining}}

Neighbor-joining methods apply general [[cluster analysis]] techniques to sequence analysis using genetic distance as a clustering metric. The simple [[neighbor-joining]] method produces unrooted trees, but it does not assume a constant rate of evolution (i.e., a [[molecular clock]]) across lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saitou|first=N.|last2=Nei|first2=M.|date=1987-07-01|title=The neighbor-joining method: a new method for reconstructing phylogenetic trees.|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/4/406|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=406–425|issn=0737-4038|pmid=3447015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fitch-Margoliash method===
The [[Distance matrices in phylogeny#Fitch-Margoliash method|Fitch-Margoliash method]] uses a weighted [[least squares]] method for clustering based on genetic distance.&lt;ref name="fitch"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WM | authorlink = Walter M. Fitch | authorlink2 = Emanuel Margoliash | last2 = Margoliash | first2 = E. | year = 1967 | title = Construction of phylogenetic trees | url = | journal = Science | volume = 155 | issue = 3760| pages = 279–284 | doi=10.1126/science.155.3760.279 | pmid=5334057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related sequences are given more weight in the tree construction process to correct for the increased inaccuracy in measuring distances between distantly related sequences. The distances used as input to the algorithm must be normalized to prevent large artifacts in computing relationships between closely related and distantly related groups. The distances calculated by this method must be [[linear]]; the linearity criterion for distances requires that the [[expected value]]s of the branch lengths for two individual branches must equal the expected value of the sum of the two branch distances - a property that applies to biological sequences only when they have been corrected for the possibility of [[Mutation#By effect on function|back mutation]]s at individual sites. This correction is done through the use of a [[substitution matrix]] such as that derived from the [[Jukes-Cantor model]] of DNA evolution. The distance correction is only necessary in practice when the evolution rates differ among branches.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; Another modification of the algorithm can be helpful, especially in case of concentrated distances (please report to [[concentration of measure]] phenomenon and [[curse of dimensionality]]): that modification, described in,&lt;ref name="Lespinats"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lespinats | first1 = S. | last2 = Grando | first2 = D. | last3 = Maréchal | first3 = E. | last4 = Hakimi | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Tenaillon | first5 = O. | last6 = Bastien | first6 = O. | year = 2011 | title = How Fitch-Margoliash Algorithm can benefit from Multi Dimensional Scaling | url = | journal = [[Evolutionary Bioinformatics]] | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 61–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been shown to improve the efficiency of the algorithm and its robustness.

The least-squares criterion applied to these distances is more accurate but less efficient than the neighbor-joining methods. An additional improvement that corrects for correlations between distances that arise from many closely related sequences in the data set can also be applied at increased computational cost. Finding the optimal least-squares tree with any correction factor is [[NP-complete]],&lt;ref name="day"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = William HE | year = 1987 | title = Computational complexity of inferring phylogenies from dissimilarity matrices | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092824087800071 | journal = [[Bulletin of Mathematical Biology]] | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 461–467 | doi=10.1016/s0092-8240(87)80007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; so [[heuristic]] search methods like those used in maximum-parsimony analysis are applied to the search through tree space.

===Using outgroups===
Independent information about the relationship between sequences or groups can be used to help reduce the tree search space and root unrooted trees. Standard usage of distance-matrix methods involves the inclusion of at least one [[Outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]] sequence known to be only distantly related to the sequences of interest in the query set.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; This usage can be seen as a type of [[experimental control]]. If the outgroup has been appropriately chosen, it will have a much greater [[genetic distance]] and thus a longer branch length than any other sequence, and it will appear near the root of a rooted tree. Choosing an appropriate outgroup requires the selection of a sequence that is moderately related to the sequences of interest; too close a relationship defeats the purpose of the outgroup and too distant adds [[signal noise|noise]] to the analysis.&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; Care should also be taken to avoid situations in which the species from which the sequences were taken are distantly related, but the gene encoded by the sequences is highly [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] across lineages. [[Horizontal gene transfer]], especially between otherwise divergent [[bacteria]], can also confound outgroup usage.

==Maximum parsimony==
[[Maximum parsimony]] (MP) is a method of identifying the potential phylogenetic tree that requires the smallest total number of [[evolution]]ary events to explain the observed sequence data. Some ways of scoring trees also include a "cost" associated with particular types of evolutionary events and attempt to locate the tree with the smallest total cost. This is a useful approach in cases where not every possible type of event is equally likely - for example, when particular [[nucleotide]]s or [[amino acid]]s are known to be more mutable than others.

The most naive way of identifying the most parsimonious tree is simple enumeration - considering each possible tree in succession and searching for the tree with the smallest score. However, this is only possible for a relatively small number of sequences or species because the problem of identifying the most parsimonious tree is known to be [[NP-hard]];&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; consequently a number of [[heuristic]] search methods for [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] have been developed to locate a highly parsimonious tree, if not the best in the set. Most such methods involve a [[steepest descent]]-style minimization mechanism operating on a [[tree rearrangement]] criterion.

===Branch and bound===
The [[branch and bound]] algorithm is a general method used to increase the efficiency of searches for near-optimal solutions of [[NP-hard]] problems first applied to phylogenetics in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="hendy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hendy | first1 = MD | last2 = Penny | first2 = D | year = 1982 | title = Branch and bound algorithms to determine minimal evolutionary trees | url = | journal = Math Biosci | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 133–142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Branch and bound is particularly well suited to phylogenetic tree construction because it inherently requires dividing a problem into a [[tree structure]] as it subdivides the problem space into smaller regions. As its name implies, it requires as input both a branching rule (in the case of phylogenetics, the addition of the next species or sequence to the tree) and a bound (a rule that excludes certain regions of the search space from consideration, thereby assuming that the optimal solution cannot occupy that region). Identifying a good bound is the most challenging aspect of the algorithm's application to phylogenetics. A simple way of defining the bound is a maximum number of assumed evolutionary changes allowed per tree. A set of criteria known as Zharkikh's rules&lt;ref name="zharkikh"&gt;Ratner VA, Zharkikh AA, Kolchanov N, Rodin S, Solovyov S, Antonov AS. (1995). ''Molecular Evolution'' Biomathematics Series Vol 24. Springer-Verlag: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; severely limit the search space by defining characteristics shared by all candidate "most parsimonious" trees. The two most basic rules require the elimination of all but one redundant sequence (for cases where multiple observations have produced identical data) and the elimination of character sites at which two or more states do not occur in at least two species. Under ideal conditions these rules and their associated algorithm would completely define a tree.

===Sankoff-Morel-Cedergren algorithm===
The Sankoff-Morel-Cedergren algorithm was among the first published methods to simultaneously produce an MSA and a phylogenetic tree for nucleotide sequences.&lt;ref name="sankoff"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sankoff | first1 = D | last2 = Morel | first2 = C | last3 = Cedergren | first3 = RJ | year = 1973 | title = Evolution of 5S RNA and the non-randomness of base replacement | url = | journal = Nature New Biology | volume = 245 | issue = 147| pages = 232–234 | doi=10.1038/newbio245232a0 | pmid=4201431}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method uses a [[maximum parsimony]] calculation in conjunction with a scoring function that penalizes gaps and mismatches, thereby favoring the tree that introduces a minimal number of such events (an alternative view holds that the trees to be favored are those that maximize the amount of sequence similarity that can be interpreted as homology, a point of view that may lead to different optimal trees &lt;ref name="de_laet2005"&gt;De Laet J. (2005). Parsimony and the problem of inapplicables in sequence data. Pp. 81-116 in Albert, V.A. (ed.) ''Parsimony, phylogeny and genomics.'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-856493-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The imputed sequences at the [[interior node]]s of the tree are scored and summed over all the nodes in each possible tree. The lowest-scoring tree sum provides both an optimal tree and an optimal MSA given the scoring function. Because the method is highly computationally intensive, an approximate method in which initial guesses for the interior alignments are refined one node at a time. Both the full and the approximate version are in practice calculated by dynamic programming.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===MALIGN and POY===
More recent phylogenetic tree/MSA methods use heuristics to isolate high-scoring, but not necessarily optimal, trees. The MALIGN method uses a maximum-parsimony technique to compute a multiple alignment by maximizing a [[cladogram]] score, and its companion POY uses an iterative method that couples the optimization of the phylogenetic tree with improvements in the corresponding MSA.&lt;ref name="wheeler"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wheeler | first1 = WC | last2 = Gladstein | first2 = DG | year = 1994 | title = MALIGN: a multiple nucleic acid sequence alignment program | url = | journal = Journal of Heredity | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 417–418 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a111492}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of these methods in constructing evolutionary hypotheses has been criticized as biased due to the deliberate construction of trees reflecting minimal evolutionary events.&lt;ref name="simmons"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simmons | first1 = MP | year = 2004 | title = Independence of alignment and tree search | url = | journal = Mol Phylogenet Evol | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 874–879 | pmid = 15120385 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2003.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, has been countered by the view that such methods should be seen as heuristic approaches to find the trees that maximize the amount of sequence similarity that can be interpreted as homology.&lt;ref name="de_laet2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="de_laet2015"&gt;
{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/cla.12098 | title = Parsimony analysis of unaligned sequence data: maximization of homology and minimization of homoplasy, not Minimization of operationally defined total cost or minimization of equally weighted transformations | year = 2015 | author = De Laet, Jan | journal = Cladistics | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 550 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maximum likelihood==
The [[maximum likelihood]] method uses standard statistical techniques for inferring [[probability distribution]]s to assign probabilities to particular possible phylogenetic trees. The method requires a [[substitution model]] to assess the probability of particular [[mutation]]s; roughly, a tree that requires more mutations at interior nodes to explain the observed phylogeny will be assessed as having a lower probability. This is broadly similar to the maximum-parsimony method, but maximum likelihood allows additional statistical flexibility by permitting varying rates of evolution across both lineages and sites. In fact, the method requires that evolution at different sites and along different lineages must be [[statistically independent]]. Maximum likelihood is thus well suited to the analysis of distantly related sequences, but it is believed to be computationally intractable to compute due to its NP-hardness.&lt;ref name="chor"&gt;Chor B, Tuller T. (2005). Maximum likelihood of evolutionary trees: hardness and approximation. ''Bioinformatics'' 21.suppl 1:  i97-i106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "pruning" algorithm, a variant of [[dynamic programming]], is often used to reduce the search space by efficiently calculating the likelihood of subtrees.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; The method calculates the likelihood for each site in a "linear" manner, starting at a node whose only descendants are leaves (that is, the tips of the tree) and working backwards toward the "bottom" node in nested sets. However, the trees produced by the method are only rooted if the substitution model is irreversible, which is not generally true of biological systems. The search for the maximum-likelihood tree also includes a branch length optimization component that is difficult to improve upon algorithmically; general [[global optimization]] tools such as the [[Newton-Raphson]] method are often used.

==Bayesian inference==&lt;!--There is at least one wikilink here, so fix if you change the section title--&gt;
{{Main|Bayesian inference in phylogeny}}
[[Bayesian inference]] can be used to produce phylogenetic trees in a manner closely related to the maximum likelihood methods. Bayesian methods assume a prior [[probability distribution]] of the possible trees, which may simply be the probability of any one tree among all the possible trees that could be generated from the data, or may be a more sophisticated estimate derived from the assumption that divergence events such as [[speciation]] occur as [[stochastic process]]es. The choice of prior distribution is a point of contention among users of Bayesian-inference phylogenetics methods.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

Implementations of Bayesian methods generally use [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] sampling algorithms, although the choice of move set varies; selections used in Bayesian phylogenetics include circularly permuting leaf nodes of a proposed tree at each step&lt;ref name="Mau"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mau | first1 = B | last2 = Newton | first2 = MA | year = 1997 | title = Phylogenetic inference for binary data on dendrograms using Markov chain Monte Carlo | url = | journal = J Comp Graph Stat | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 122–131 | doi=10.2307/1390728| jstor = 1390728 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and swapping descendant subtrees of a random [[internal node]] between two related trees.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = Z | last2 = Rannala | first2 = B | year = 1997 | title = bayesian phylogenetic inference using DNA sequences: a Markov chain Monte Carlo method | url = | journal = Mol Biol Evol | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 717–724 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Bayesian methods in phylogenetics has been controversial, largely due to incomplete specification of the choice of move set, acceptance criterion, and prior distribution in published work.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;  Bayesian methods are generally held to be superior to parsimony-based methods; they can be more prone to long-branch attraction than maximum likelihood techniques,&lt;ref name="Kolaczkowski2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kolaczkowski | first1 = B. | last2 = Thornton | first2 = J.

Whereas likelihood methods find the tree that maximizes the probability of the data, a Bayesian approach recovers a tree that represents the most likely clades, by drawing on the posterior distribution.  However, estimates of the posterior probability of clades (measuring their 'support') can be quite wide of the mark, especially in clades that aren't overwhelmingly likely. As such, other methods have been put forwards to estimate posterior probability.&lt;ref name="Larget2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Larget | first1 = B. | title = The Estimation of Tree Posterior Probabilities Using Conditional Clade Probability Distributions | doi = 10.1093/sysbio/syt014 | journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 501–511 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23479066| pmc =3676676 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model selection==
Molecular phylogenetics methods rely on a defined [[substitution model]] that encodes a hypothesis about the relative rates of [[mutation]] at various sites along the gene or amino acid sequences being studied. At their simplest, substitution models aim to correct for differences in the rates of [[transition (genetics)|transitions]] and [[transversion]]s in nucleotide sequences. The use of substitution models is necessitated by the fact that the [[genetic distance]] between two sequences increases linearly only for a short time after the two sequences diverge from each other (alternatively, the distance is linear only shortly before [[coalescent theory|coalescence]]). The longer the amount of time after divergence, the more likely it becomes that two mutations occur at the same nucleotide site. Simple genetic distance calculations will thus undercount the number of mutation events that have occurred in evolutionary history. The extent of this undercount increases with increasing time since divergence, which can lead to the phenomenon of [[long branch attraction]], or the misassignment of two distantly related but convergently evolving sequences as closely related.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152633 | title = Model Selection in Phylogenetics | year = 2005 | author = Sullivan, Jack | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 445–466 | last2 = Joyce | first2 = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum parsimony method is particularly susceptible to this problem due to its explicit search for a tree representing a minimum number of distinct evolutionary events.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;

===Types of models===
{{Main|Substitution model}}

All substitution models assign a set of weights to each possible change of state represented in the sequence. The most common model types are implicitly reversible because they assign the same weight to, for example, a G&gt;C nucleotide mutation as to a C&gt;G mutation. The simplest possible model, the [[Jukes-Cantor model]], assigns an equal probability to every possible change of state for a given nucleotide base. The rate of change between any two distinct nucleotides will be one-third of the overall substitution rate.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; More advanced models distinguish between [[transition (genetics)|transitions]] and [[transversion]]s. The most general possible time-reversible model, called the GTR model, has six mutation rate parameters. An even more generalized model known as the general 12-parameter model breaks time-reversibility, at the cost of much additional complexity in calculating genetic distances that are consistent among multiple lineages.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; One possible variation on this theme adjusts the rates so that overall GC content - an important measure of DNA double helix stability - varies over time.&lt;ref name="Galtier"&gt;Galtier N, Guoy M. (1998.) Inferring pattern and process: maximum-likelihood implementation of a nonhomogeneous model of DNA sequence evolution for phylogenetic analysis. ''Mol. Biol. Evol.'' 15:871–879.&lt;/ref&gt;

Models may also allow for the variation of rates with positions in the input sequence. The most obvious example of such variation follows from the arrangement of nucleotides in protein-coding genes into three-base [[codon]]s. If the location of the [[open reading frame]] (ORF) is known, rates of mutation can be adjusted for position of a given site within a codon, since it is known that [[wobble base pair]]ing can allow for higher mutation rates in the third nucleotide of a given codon without affecting the codon's meaning in the [[genetic code]].&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; A less hypothesis-driven example that does not rely on ORF identification simply assigns to each site a rate randomly drawn from a predetermined distribution, often the [[gamma distribution]] or [[log-normal distribution]].&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt; Finally, a more conservative estimate of rate variations known as the [[covarion]] method allows [[autocorrelation|autocorrelated]] variations in rates, so that the mutation rate of a given site is correlated across sites and lineages.&lt;ref name="FitchMarkowitz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WM | last2 = Markowitz | first2 = E | year = 1970 | title = An improved method for determining codon variability in a gene and its application to the rate of fixation of mutations in evolution | url = | journal = Biochemical Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 5| pages = 579–593 | doi=10.1007/bf00486096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choosing the best model===
The selection of an appropriate model is critical for the production of good phylogenetic analyses, both because underparameterized or overly restrictive models may produce aberrant behavior when their underlying assumptions are violated, and because overly complex or overparameterized models are computationally expensive and the parameters may be overfit.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; The most common method of model selection is the [[likelihood ratio test]] (LRT), which produces a likelihood estimate that can be interpreted as a measure of "[[goodness of fit]]" between the model and the input data.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; However, care must be taken in using these results, since a more complex model with more parameters will always have a higher likelihood than a simplified version of the same model, which can lead to the naive selection of models that are overly complex.&lt;ref name="felsenstein" /&gt;  For this reason model selection computer programs will choose the simplest model that is not significantly worse than more complex substitution models. A significant disadvantage of the LRT is the necessity of making a series of pairwise comparisons between models; it has been shown that the order in which the models are compared has a major effect on the one that is eventually selected.&lt;ref name="Pol"&gt;Pol D. (2004.) Empirical problems of the hierarchical likelihood ratio test for model selection. ''Syst Biol'' 53:949–962.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative model selection method is the [[Akaike information criterion]] (AIC), formally an estimate of the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] between the true model and the model being tested. It can be interpreted as a likelihood estimate with a correction factor to penalize overparameterized models.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; The AIC is calculated on an individual model rather than a pair, so it is independent of the order in which models are assessed. A related alternative, the [[Bayesian information criterion]] (BIC), has a similar basic interpretation but penalizes complex models more heavily.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

A comprehensive step-by-step protocol on constructing phylogenetic tree, including DNA/Amino Acid contiguous sequence assembly, multiple sequence alignment, model-test (testing best-fitting substitution models) and phylogeny reconstruction using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference, is available at ''Nature Protocol''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/protex.2013.065 | title=Sequence similarity search, Multiple Sequence Alignment, Model Selection, Distance Matrix and Phylogeny Reconstruction | year=2013 | journal=Protocol Exchange | last1 = Bast | first1 = Felix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A non traditional way of evaluating the phylogenetic tree is to compare it with clustering result. One can use a Multidimensional Scaling technique, so called Interpolative Joining to do dimensionality reduction to visualize the clustering result for the sequences in 3D, and then map the phylogenetic tree onto the clustering result. A better tree usually has a higher correlation with the clustering result.&lt;ref&gt;Ruan, Yang, et al. "Integration of Clustering and Multidimensional Scaling to Determine Phylogenetic Trees as Spherical Phylograms Visualized in 3 Dimensions." Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid), 2014 14th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on. IEEE, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluating tree support==
As with all statistical analysis, the estimation of phylogenies from character data requires an evaluation of confidence. A number of methods exist to test the amount of support for a phylogenetic tree, either by evaluating the support for each sub-tree in the phylogeny (nodal support) or evaluating whether the phylogeny is significantly different from other possible trees (alternative tree hypothesis tests).

===Nodal support===
The most common method for assessing tree support is to evaluate the statistical support for each node on the tree. Typically, a node with very low support is not considered valid in further analysis, and visually may be collapsed into a [[polytomy]] to indicate that relationships within a clade are unresolved.

====Consensus tree====
Many methods for assessing nodal support involve consideration of multiple phylogenies. The consensus tree summarizes the nodes that are shared among a set of trees.&lt;ref name="BaumSmith2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David A. Baum|author2=Stacey D. Smith|title=Tree Thinking: An Introduction to Phylogenetic Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zW_ApwAACAAJ|year=2013|publisher=Roberts|isbn=978-1-936221-16-5|page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a *strict consensus,* only nodes found in every tree are shown, and the rest are collapsed into an unresolved [[polytomy]]. Less conservative methods, such as the *majority-rule consensus* tree, consider nodes that are supported by a given percentage of trees under consideration (such as at least 50%).

For example, in maximum parsimony analysis, there may be many trees with the same parsimony score. A strict consensus tree would show which nodes are found in all equally parsimonious trees, and which nodes differ. Consensus trees are also used to evaluate support on phylogenies reconstructed with Bayesian inference (see below).

====Bootstrapping and jackknifing====
In statistics, the [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]] is a method for inferring the variability of data that has an unknown distribution using pseudoreplications of the original data. For example, given a set of 100 data points, a [[pseudoreplicate]] is a data set of the same size (100 points) randomly sampled from the original data, with replacement. That is, each original data point may be represented more than once in the pseudoreplicate, or not at all. Statistical support involves evaluation of whether the original data has similar properties to a large set of pseudoreplicates.

In phylogenetics, bootstrapping is conducted using the columns of the character matrix. Each pseudoreplicate contains the same number of species (rows) and characters (columns) randomly sampled from the original matrix, with replacement. A phylogeny is reconstructed from each pseudoreplicate, with the same methods used to reconstruct the phylogeny from the original data. For each node on the phylogeny, the nodal support is the percentage of pseudoreplicates containing that node.&lt;ref name="Felsenstein1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Felsenstein|first1=Joseph|title=Confidence Limits on Phylogenies: An Approach Using the Bootstrap|journal=Evolution|volume=39|issue=4|year=1985|pages=783–791|issn=0014-3820|doi=10.2307/2408678|pmid=28561359|jstor=2408678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statistical rigor of the bootstrap test has been empirically evaluated using viral populations with known evolutionary histories,&lt;ref name="HillisBull1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillis|first1=D. M.|last2=Bull|first2=J. J.|title=An Empirical Test of Bootstrapping as a Method for Assessing Confidence in Phylogenetic Analysis|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=42|issue=2|year=1993|pages=182–192|issn=1063-5157|doi=10.1093/sysbio/42.2.182}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding that 70% bootstrap support corresponds to a 95% probability that the clade exists. However, this was tested under ideal conditions (e.g. no change in evolutionary rates, symmetric phylogenies). In practice, values above 70% are generally supported and left to the researcher or reader to evaluate confidence. Nodes with support lower than 70% are typically considered unresolved.

Jackknifing in phylogenetics is a similar procedure, except the columns of the matrix are sampled without replacement. Pseudoreplicates are generated by randomly subsampling the data—for example, a "10% jackknife" would involve randomly sampling 10% of the matrix many times to evaluate nodal support.

==== Posterior probability ====
Reconstruction of phylogenies using [[Bayesian inference]] generates a posterior distribution of highly probable trees given the data and evolutionary model, rather than a single "best" tree. The trees in the posterior distribution generally have many different topologies. Most Bayesian inference methods utilize a Markov-chain Monte Carlo iteration, and the initial steps of this chain are not considered reliable reconstructions of the phylogeny. Trees generated early in the chain are usually discarded as [[burn-in]]. The most common method of evaluating nodal support in a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis is to calculate the percentage of trees in the posterior distribution (post-burn-in) which contain the node.

The statistical support for a node in Bayesian inference is expected to reflect the probability that a clade really exists given the data and evolutionary model.&lt;ref name="HuelsenbeckRannala2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huelsenbeck|first1=John|last2=Rannala|first2=Bruce|title=Frequentist Properties of Bayesian Posterior Probabilities of Phylogenetic Trees Under Simple and Complex Substitution Models|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=53|issue=6|year=2004|pages=904–913|issn=1063-5157|doi=10.1080/10635150490522629|pmid=15764559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the threshold for accepting a node as supported is generally higher than for bootstrapping.

==== Step counting methods====
[[Bremer support]] counts the number of extra steps needed to contradict a clade.

===Shortcomings ===
These measures each have their weaknesses. For example, smaller or larger clades tend to attract larger support values than mid-sized clades, simply as a result of the number of taxa in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/jzs.12024| title = Evaluating the clade size effect in alternative measures of branch support| journal = Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research| pages = n/a| year = 2013| last1 = Chemisquy | first1 = M. A. A. | last2 = Prevosti | first2 = F. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bootstrap support can provide high estimates of node support as a result of noise in the data rather than the true existence of a clade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msh137| pmid = 15084674| title = Genome-Scale Phylogeny and the Detection of Systematic Biases| journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution| volume = 21| issue = 7| pages = 1455–1458| year = 2004| last1 = Phillips | first1 = M. J.| last2 = Delsuc| first2 = F| last3 = Penny| first3 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and workarounds ==
Ultimately, there is no way to measure whether a particular phylogenetic hypothesis is accurate or not, unless the true relationships among the taxa being examined are already known (which may happen with bacteria or viruses under laboratory conditions). The best result an empirical phylogeneticist can hope to attain is a tree with branches that are well supported by the available evidence. Several potential pitfalls have been identified:

=== Homoplasy ===
{{main|Convergent evolution}}
Certain characters are more likely to [[Convergent evolution|evolve convergently]] than others; logically, such characters should be given less weight in the reconstruction of a tree.&lt;ref name=Goloboff2008&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2008.00209.x |title=Weighting against homoplasy improves phylogenetic analysis of morphological data sets |year=2008 |last1=Goloboff |first1=Pablo A. |last2=Carpenter |first2=James M. |last3=Arias |first3=J. Salvador |last4=Esquivel |first4=Daniel Rafael Miranda |journal=Cladistics |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=758–773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weights in the form of a model of evolution can be inferred from sets of molecular data, so that [[maximum likelihood]] or [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] methods can be used to analyze them. For molecular sequences, this problem is exacerbated when the taxa under study have diverged substantially. As time since the divergence of two taxa increase, so does the probability of multiple substitutions on the same site, or back mutations, all of which result in homoplasies.  For morphological data, unfortunately, the only objective way to determine convergence is by the construction of a tree&amp;nbsp;– a somewhat circular method. Even so, weighting homoplasious characters{{how|date=September 2012}} does indeed lead to better-supported trees.&lt;ref name=Goloboff2008/&gt; Further refinement can be brought by weighting changes in one direction higher than changes in another; for instance, the presence of thoracic wings almost guarantees placement among the pterygote insects because, although wings are often lost secondarily, there is no evidence that they have been gained more than once.&lt;ref name=Goloboff1997&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.1997.tb00317.x |title=Self-Weighted Optimization: Tree Searches and Character State Reconstructions under Implied Transformation Costs |year=1997 |last1=Goloboff |first1=Pablo A. |journal=Cladistics |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=225–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horizontal gene transfer ===
In general, organisms can inherit genes in two ways: vertical gene transfer and [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Vertical gene transfer is the passage of genes from parent to offspring, and horizontal (also called lateral) gene transfer occurs when genes jump between unrelated organisms, a common phenomenon especially in [[prokaryote]]s; a good example of this is the acquired [[antibiotic resistance]] as a result of gene exchange between various bacteria leading to multi-drug-resistant bacterial species. There have also been well-documented cases of horizontal gene transfer [[Horizontal gene transfer#Eukaryotes|between eukaryotes]].

Horizontal gene transfer has complicated the determination of phylogenies of organisms, and inconsistencies in phylogeny have been reported among specific groups of organisms depending on the genes used to construct evolutionary trees. The only way to determine which genes have been acquired vertically and which horizontally is to [[Occam's razor|parsimoniously]] assume that the largest set of genes that have been inherited together have been inherited vertically; this requires analyzing a large number of genes.

=== Hybrids, speciation, introgressions and incomplete  lineage sorting===
The basic assumption underlying the mathematical model of cladistics is a situation where species split neatly in bifurcating fashion. While such an assumption may hold on a larger scale (bar horizontal gene transfer, see above), [[speciation]] is often much less orderly. Research since the cladistic method was introduced has shown that [[hybrid speciation]], once thought rare, is in fact quite common, particularly in plants.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=M.L.|title=Natural Hybridization and Evolution|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-509975-1|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendel, J F. &amp; Doyle, J.J.

Kluwer, Boston, pp. 265–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[paraspecies|paraphyletic speciation]] is common, making the assumption of a bifurcating pattern unsuitable, leading to [[phylogenetic network]]s rather than trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Funk | first1 = D.

In species level analysis this can be dealt with by larger sampling or better whole genome analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollard|first1=Daniel A.|last2=Iyer|first2=Venky N.|last3=Moses|first3=Alan M.|last4=Eisen|first4=Michael B.|title=Widespread Discordance of Gene Trees with Species Tree in Drosophila: Evidence for Incomplete Lineage Sorting|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=2006|volume=2|issue=10|pages=e173|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020173|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020173|pmid=17132051|pmc=1626107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the problem is avoided by restricting the analysis to fewer, not closely related specimens.

=== Taxon sampling ===
Owing to the development of advanced sequencing techniques in [[molecular biology]], it has become feasible to gather large amounts of data (DNA or amino acid sequences) to infer phylogenetic hypotheses. For example, it is not rare to find studies with character matrices based on whole [[mitochondrial]] genomes (~16,000 nucleotides, in many animals). However, simulations have shown that it is more important to increase the number of taxa in the matrix than to increase the number of characters, because the more taxa there are, the more accurate and more robust is the resulting phylogenetic tree.&lt;ref name="Zwickl2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10635150290102339 |title=Increased Taxon Sampling Greatly Reduces Phylogenetic Error |year=2002 |last1=Zwickl |first1=Derrick J. |last2=Hillis |first2=David M. |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=588–598 |pmid=12228001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiens2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2005.04.001 |title=Missing data and the design of phylogenetic analyses |year=2006 |last1=Wiens |first1=John J. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics |volume=39 |pages=34–42 |pmid=15922672 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be partly due to the breaking up of [[long branch attraction|long branches]].

=== Phylogenetic signal ===
Another important factor that affects the accuracy of tree reconstruction is whether the data analyzed actually contain a useful phylogenetic signal, a term that is used generally to denote whether a character evolves slowly enough to have the same state in closely related taxa as opposed to varying randomly. Tests for phylogenetic signal exist.&lt;ref name="Blomberg2003"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12778543 |year=2003 |last1=Blomberg |first1=Simon P. |last2=Garland Jr |first2=Theodore |last3=Ives |first3=Anthony R. |title=Testing for phylogenetic signal in comparative data: Behavioral traits are more labile |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=717–745 |journal=Evolution |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00285.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continuous characters ===
Morphological characters that sample a continuum may contain phylogenetic signal, but are hard to code as discrete characters. Several methods have been used, one of which is gap coding, and there are variations on gap coding.&lt;ref name=Archie1985&gt;{{cite journal|author=Archie, J.W.|year=1985|title=Methods for coding variable morphological features for numerical taxonomic analysis|journal=Systematic Zoology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=326–345|url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/3/326.abstract|doi=10.2307/2413151|jstor=2413151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original form of gap coding:&lt;ref name=Archie1985/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;group means for a character are first ordered by size. The pooled within-group standard deviation is calculated ... and differences between adjacent means ... are compared relative to this standard deviation. Any pair of adjacent means is considered different and given different integer scores ... if the means are separated by a "gap" greater than the within-group standard deviation ... times some arbitrary constant.&lt;/blockquote&gt; If more taxa are added to the analysis, the gaps between taxa may become so small that all information is lost. Generalized gap coding works around that problem by comparing individual pairs of taxa rather than considering one set that contains all of the taxa.&lt;ref name=Archie1985/&gt;

=== Missing data ===
In general, the more data that are available when constructing a tree, the more accurate and reliable the resulting tree will be. Missing data are no more detrimental than simply having fewer data, although the impact is greatest when most of the missing data are in a small number of taxa. Concentrating the missing data across a small number of characters produces a more robust tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prevosti |first1=Francisco J. |last2=Chemisquy |first2=María A. |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2009.00289.x |title=The impact of missing data on real morphological phylogenies: Influence of the number and distribution of missing entries |year=2009 |journal=Cladistics |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=326–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of fossils ==
Because many characters involve embryological, or soft-tissue or molecular characters that (at best) hardly ever fossilize, and the interpretation of fossils is more ambiguous than that of [[Extant taxon|living taxa]], extinct taxa almost invariably have higher proportions of missing data than living ones. However, despite these limitations, the inclusion of fossils is invaluable, as they can provide information in sparse areas of trees, breaking up long branches and constraining intermediate character states; thus, fossil taxa contribute as much to tree resolution as modern taxa.&lt;ref name=Cobbett2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10635150701627296 |title=Fossils Impact as Hard as Living Taxa in Parsimony Analyses of Morphology |year=2007 |last1=Cobbett |first1=Andrea |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Mark |last3=Wills |first3=Matthew |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=753–766 |pmid=17886145}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Fossils can also constrain the age of lineages and thus demonstrate how consistent a tree is with the stratigraphic record;&lt;ref name="Huelsenbeck"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5105">A '''decision game''' is an exercise in which a [[teacher]] presents [[Student|students]] with a scenario, asks them to take on the role of a character in that scenario, and then asks them to solve problems as if they were that character.  If the scenario is based entirely upon a reliable historical narrative, a decision game is also a ''[[case method|decision-forcing case]]''.  However, if any of the elements in the scenario are fictional, then the exercise is a ''fictional decision game''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lgdata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/2215/1460284/Decision-Forcing-Cases.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Until the late twentieth century, most decision games dealt with problems drawn from the realm of tactics.  The exceptions to this general rule, moreover, were incidental rather than deliberate.  That is, while authors of [[case method | decision-forcing cases]] in such disciplines as business management and public policy would sometimes fictionalize their cases (thereby converting them into fictional decision games), these works were invariably (if erroneously) described as "case studies".  Because of this, the history of the decision game was, until recently, very hard to distinguish from the history of the [[tactical decision game]].

Since the 1990s, decision games dealing with matters other than military tactics have made their appearance.  Some of these exercises deal with situations, such as those faced by police officers, fire fighters, and first responders, that have so much in common with tactical military problems that they are accurately described as "tactical decision games".    In other instances, the problems are so different from those faced by military tacticians that the use of the term "tactical decision games" would be misleading.

==Elements of a decision game==

A decision game has two indispensable elements:

# The presentation of the problem to participants.
# The discussion of solutions.

In most instances, however, the instructor will add a third element, which is the presentation of a "wrap up" solution to the problem.  If the decision game is fictional, this would be his own solution to the problem.  If the decision game is a decision-forcing case, then the solution would be the decision made by the protagonist of the case, followed by the immediate results of that decision.

==Types of decision games==

The taxonomy of decision games is based upon two attributes.  The first of these, whether the game is historical (real) or fictional (imaginary), is a binary attribute.  That is, a decision game can either be real or imaginary, but it cannot be both.  The second attribute, which is the art to which the problem at the heart of the game belongs, is open ended.  That is, there is no inherent limit to the number of arts for which decision games can be created.  Moreover, a given decision game can deal with a problem that belongs to more than one art.  Thus, for example, a decision game designed for police officers may deal with both ethics and tactics.

Common types of decision games include:

* business decision games 
* ethical decision games
* firefighting decision games
* leadership decision games
* logistical decision games
* operational decision games 
* police decision games 
* strategic decision games 
* [[tactical decision game|tactical decision games]]

'''''Early Music History''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published annually by [[Cambridge University Press]], which specialises in the study of [[music]] from the [[early Middle Ages]] to the end of the 17th century. It was established in 1981 and is edited by [[Iain Fenlon]].
{{cquote|''Early Music History'' exists to stimulate further exploration of familiar phenomena through unfamiliar means, and to add to the growing appreciation of the value of interdisciplianary approaches and their potentialities.  Another emphasis might be called the contextual.  At present some music historians tend to concentrate on the internal analysis of a composition and its relation to a specific and usually narrowly defined historical frame.  Indeed, much musicological writing presents by implication a formidable orthodoxy in which history is perceived as a succession of paradigms of musical language, style, and form.  Some recent work has attempted explanation through exploration of a wider range of evidence, and Early Music History intends to strengthen this trend by encouraging studies that examine the economic, political, and social ramifications of research.  In that musicology itself can on benefit if its vision is extended and its methods refined and broadened, the board believes that ''Early Music History'' will mark a new departure in the development of the discipline while continuing to support its traditional tasks.|15px|15px|Iain Fenlon, preface to Volume I&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iain Fenlon |title=Preface |journal=Early Music History |volume=1 |pages=vii-vii |year=1981|doi= 10.1017/S0261127900000243|url= |issn=1474-0559}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5338">The '''European Technology Assessment Group''' (ETAG) is a cooperative network of scientific institutions that carries out studies in the field of [[technology assessment]] on behalf of the [[European Parliament]].

[[Image:ETAG.jpg|thumb|ETAG-Logo]]

==History and Mission==
Since October 2005 a group of European scientific institutes active in the field of [[technology assessment]] - with the [[Institute for Technology Assessment and Systems Analysis (ITAS)]], [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT), Germany, as the leading partner - has been providing scientific services for the [[European Parliament]] on social, environmental and economic aspects of new technological and scientific developments.

Like many other parliaments in Europe&lt;ref&gt;See the members of the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network.&lt;/ref&gt; the European Parliament at the end of the 1980s set up an institution for scientific advice regarding complex social, ecological and economic implications of modern technology and scientific research. At the European Parliament the process of consulting is organised by the STOA panel ([[Scientific Technology Options Assessment]]), a parliamentary body consisting of 15 Members of Parliament representing several parliamentary committees. In view of the growing importance of European science and technology policy the European Parliament decided to support STOA’s activities by establishing permanent co-operation with a group of institutions with relevant expertise in the field of technology assessment.

Starting from May 2009 the European Technology Assessment Group (ETAG) for a second period of three years supports STOA by carrying out TA studies. The focus of ETAG’s activities on behalf of the European Parliament will be on studies in the fields of [[transport]], [[Information and communications technologies|ICT]] and [[Information society]], [[Nanotechnology|nanoscale science and technology]], [[Life Sciences|life sciences]] and [[Quality of Life|human well being]] as well as [[agriculture]], [[food]] and [[biotechnology]].

==Partners==
Apart from being leading institutions in the field of [[technology assessment]] in their home countries most members of the group have long-term experience in [[policy consulting]] for parliamentary bodies and most of them are members of the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network. ETAG is made up by the following organisations:
* [[Institute for Technology Assessment and Systems Analysis (ITAS)]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itas.kit.edu/english/ ITAS]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT), which operates the [[Office of Technology Assessment at the German Parliament]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tab-beim-bundestag.de/en TAB]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Danish Board of Technology]] (DBT),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tekno.dk DBT]&lt;/ref&gt; which provides consultancy services for the Danish Parliament
* [[Rathenau Instituut]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rathenau.org Rathenau Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; working for the Dutch Parliament
* [[Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research]] (ISI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isi.fraunhofer.de/isi-en/ ISI]&lt;/ref&gt; supporting ITAS in carrying out TA studies on behalf of the German Parliament
* [[Catalan Foundation for Research and Innovation]] (FCRI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcri.cat FCRI]&lt;/ref&gt; rendering scientific services for the Parliament of Catalonia
* [[Institute of Technology Assessment]] (ITA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeaw.ac.at/ita/en/ ITA]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]]
* Technology Centre AS CR,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tc.cz TC AS]&lt;/ref&gt; an institute active in TA related research run by the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]]
* [http://www.rtexpert.com Responsible Technology SAS],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtexpert.com RT]&lt;/ref&gt; a French consultancy devoted to [[Responsible Research and Innovation]] (RRI) and [http://sss.sagepub.com/content/44/2/218 Anticipatory Governance]

==Projects==
The scientific responsibility for each TA study tailored according to the information needs of the [[European Parliament]] lies with one of the partners. ITAS is responsible for administration, communication with the European Parliament and co-ordination of the activities of ETAG as well as of the group’s co-operation with a wider network of TA institutes in Europe. The work programme comprises studies dealing with a broad range of subjects from different sectors of policy making, such as R&amp;D, the environment, health and energy. Topics included: Converging Technologies; Antibiotic Resistance; Galileo Applications; Sustainable Energy Catalogue; Nanotechnology and Chemical Substitution; Options for Road and Air Transports; Cancer Therapy; RFID an identity management; Intellectual Property Rights; Global Human Health; Future Energy Systems in Europe; Future of European Transport; Technology and the Labour Market; Safety of Tunnels; Direct to Consumer Genetic Testing; Animal Welfare; Human Enhancement; ICT and Energy Efficiency; Agricultural Technologies for Developing Countries.

Studies carried out by ETAG on behalf of STOA are available at STOA’s web page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/publications/studies/default_en.htm STOA studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''experimental language''' is a [[constructed language]] designed for [[linguistics]] research, often on the relationship between [[language and thought]].

One particular assumption having received much attention in fiction is popularly known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]].  The claim is that the structure of a language somehow affects the way its speakers perceive their world, either strongly, in which case "language determines thought" ([[linguistic determinism]]), or weakly, in which case "language influences thought" ([[linguistic relativity]]). (For a list of languages that are merely mentioned, see the relevant section in [[List of constructed languages]].)

The extreme case of the strong version of the hypothesis would be the idea that words have a power inherent to themselves such that their use determines not just our thoughts, but even that which our thoughts are about, i.e. reality itself. This idea, however, is more properly treated within [[ontology]] than linguistics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Languages exploring the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis==

===Constructed languages===
* [[Láadan]] was designed by [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] in her science fiction novel [[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|''Native Tongue'']]'','' about a patriarchal society in which the overriding priority of the oppressed women is the secret development of a "feminist" language, Láadan, to aid them in throwing off their shackles.
* [[Loglan]], by [[James Cooke Brown]], was designed for linguistic research with the specific goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true. 
* [[Lojban]] is the successor of Loglan and has the same goals.
* [[Toki Pona]], by [[Sonja Elen Kisa]], is inspired by [[Taoist]] philosophy, among other things, and designed to shape the thought processes of its users in Zen-like fashion.

===Fictional languages===

====Named====
* ''[[Babel-17]]'', by [[Samuel R. Delany]], is centered on a fictional language that denies its speakers independent thought, forcing them to think purely logical thoughts. This language is used as a weapon of war, because it is supposed to convert everyone who learns it to a traitor. In the novel, the language Babel-17 is likened to computer programming languages that do not allow errors or imprecise statements.
* [[The Culture#Language|Marain]], in [[Iain M. Banks]]'s [[Culture series]]. The Culture believes (or perhaps has proved, or else actively made true) the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language affects society, and Marain was designed to exploit this effect. A related comment is made by the narrator in ''[[The Player of Games]]'' regarding gender-specific pronouns in English. Marain is also regarded as an aesthetically pleasing language.
* [[Newspeak]], by [[George Orwell]] in his dystopian novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', does not have any of the words expressing the ideas underlying a revolution with the idea that its speakers cannot revolt. All of the theory of Newspeak is aimed at eliminating such words. For example, ''bad'' has been replaced by ''ungood'', and the concept of "freedom" has been eliminated over time. According to the appendix on Newspeak, the result of the adoption of the language would be that "a heretical thought ... should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words."
* [[Pravic]] is one of the languages used in ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], that takes place partly on a world with an anarcho-communist society. Pravic contains little means for expressing possessive relationships, among other features.
* Tamarian, in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Darmok]]", is unintelligible to Starfleet's universal translators because it is too deeply rooted in local metaphor and consequently its sentences have no meaning to other civilizations.

====Unnamed====
* In ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'', by [[Ayn Rand]], the World Council attempted to enforce collectivist thinking among the populace by removing from the language all words expressing individuality.
* In ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', by [[Frank Herbert]], [[Lady Jessica]] (who has extensive linguistic training) encounters the [[Fremen]], the native people of Dune. She is shocked by the violence of their language, as she believes their word choices and language structure reflect a culture of enormous violence. Similarly, earlier in the novel, her late husband, Duke Leto, muses on how the nature of Imperial society is betrayed by "the precise delineations for treacherous death" in its language, the use of highly specific terms to describe different methods for delivering poison.
* In [[Gulf (Heinlein)|''Gulf'']], by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], the characters are taught an artificial language which allows them to think logically and concisely by removing the "false to fact" linguistic constructs of existing languages.
* ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'', by [[Jack Vance]], centers on an experiment in modeling a civilization by tweaking its language. The mastermind behind this experiment, Lord Palafox, says in chapter 9: "We must alter the mental framework of the Paonese people, which is most easily achieved by altering the language." His son, Finisterle, says in chapter 11 to a class of linguists in training: "every language impresses a certain world-view upon the mind."
* In ''Mud/Aurora'', by [[D.D. Storm]], society is divided in three classes speaking three different languages, designed to allow survival on a hostile, deserted world of a wrecked starship's crew and their descendants. The long-forgotten ship's linguist hid the true history of their world within the language spoken by the descendants of the commanding officers, the Sah.
* ''[[Snow Crash]]'', by [[Neal Stephenson]], explores the (controversial) concept of [[neuro-linguistic programming]] and presents the [[Sumerian language]] as the [[firmware]] programming language for the [[brain stem]] which is supposedly functioning as the [[BIOS]] for the human brain. According to characters in the book, the goddess [[Asherah]] is the personification of a linguistic virus similar to a computer virus. The god [[Enki]] created a counter program which he called a [[nam-shub]] that caused all of humanity to speak different languages as a protection against Asherah, supposedly giving rise to the biblical story of the [[Tower of Babel]].
* In ''[[Story of Your Life]]'', by [[Ted Chiang]], learning the written language used by alien visitors to the Earth allows the person who learns the language to think in a different way, in which the past and future are illusions of conventional thought. This allows people who understand the language to see their entire life as a single unchangeable action, from past to future.
* In ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], Valentine Michael Smith is able to do things that most other humans cannot, and is unable to explain any of this in English. However, once others learn Martian, they start to develop the ability to do these things; those concepts could be explained only in Martian.
* ''[[The Unnamable (short story)|The Unnamable]]'', by [[H.P. Lovecraft]], explores the idea of whether or not someone can conceptualize something which cannot be described by any name.
* In ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], the author discovers references in books to a universe of idealistic individuals whose languages have peculiarities that shape their idealism. For example, one of the language families lacks nouns, while another primarily uses monosyllabic adjectives to describe objects. As the story progresses the books become more and better known to the world at large, their philosophy starts influencing the real world, and Earth becomes the ideal world described in the books.

====Counterexamples====
* In ''[[The Citadel of the Autarch]]'', by [[Gene Wolfe]], one of the characters (an Ascian) speaks entirely in slogans, but is able to express deep and subtle meanings via context. The narrator, Severian, after hearing the Ascian speak, remarks that "The Ascian seemed to speak only in sentences he had learned by rote, though until he used each for the first time we had never heard them ... Second, I learned how difficult it is to eliminate the urge for expression. The people of Ascia were reduced to speaking only with their masters' voice; but they had made of it a new tongue, and I had no doubt, after hearing the Ascian, that by it he could express whatever thought he wished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolfe |first=Gene |year=1998 |title=The book of the new sun |publisher=SFBC |location=New York |page=776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages exploring other linguistic aspects==
* Several constructed languages are closer to the [[Oligosynthetic language|oligosynthetic]] type than any attested natural languages are.
* Fith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fith – FrathWiki |url=http://www.frathwiki.com/Fith |accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Jeffrey Henning has a stack-based rather than (transparently) tree-based syntax.
* Gorbiel, by Jacek Tuszynski, is designed to adhere to a set of principles for quality control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gorbiel 1.1 |url=http://lingvo.jtusz.com/gorbiel/specs/ |accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ithkuil]], by John Quijada, was designed for maximum morpho-phonological conciseness.
* [[Ilaksh]], by John Quijada, is his phonologically simpler successor to Ithkuil.
* Lin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Grammar of the language Lin |url=http://www.iiap.res.in/personnel/srik/Lin.html |accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was designed by R. Srikanth for maximum orthographic conciseness.
* Justin B. Rye has made sketches of Neanderthalese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pleistocenese – A language of 40,000 BC |url=http://jbr.me.uk/pleisto.html |accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which (among other unusual features) whole syllables, rather than identifiable segments, are [[phoneme]]s, and Europan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Europan – The decipherment of Non-Linear B |url=http://jbr.me.uk/euro/ |accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[syntax]] cannot be fully represented as trees or even as simple graphs.
* Yiklamu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Classical Yiklamu |url=http://www.polymathix.com/yiklamu/ |accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was designed by Mark P. Line as a "Russian lawn" experiment ([http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/conlang/message/153473 defined] as a field whose future paved pathways are determined by where people walk when it's still grass) starting with just a lexicon, but being grammatically simple and assuming that complexity would evolve as a consequence of use.
* [[Zaum]] is the experimental poetic language characterized by indeterminacy in meaning intended to describe the linguistic experiments of the [[Russian Futurist poets]].

In the first scene, a marriage is celebrated between [[Marguerite of Valois]], sister to Charles IX, and Henry of Navarre, king of Navarre, future [[Henry IV of France]]. Soon after, [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], leader of the Calvinist French [[Huguenot]] faction, is shot to death by a man in the hire of [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]], leader of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], an event which precipitates the [[St Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] in August 1572.

===Philip II===

[[William Shakespeare]] wrote ''[[The Life and Death of King John]]'' (1596), ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' (1599), ''[[Henry VI, part 1]]'' (1592), ''[[Henry VI, part 2]]'' (1591), and ''[[Henry VI, part 3]]'' (1591),&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William. Complete works (6th ed). New York: Longman, 2008. http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/&lt;/ref&gt; based on events during the reigns of [[John of England]], king from 1199 to 1216, [[Henry V of England]], king from 1413 to 1422, [[Henry VI of England]], king from 1422 to 1461 and from 1470 to 1471, [[Philip II of France]], king from 1180 to 1223, [[Charles VI of France]], king from 1380 to 1422, and [[Charles VII of France]], king from 1422 to 1461.

In the first scene of ''King John'', [[John of England]] receives a message from [[Philip II of France]], demanding that he abdicate his throne to his nephew, [[Arthur I of Brittany]], believed to be the rightful heir. When John refuses, war is declared. But to obtain a stronger claim to his throne and to appease the French (act 2, scene 1), John agrees to a marriage contract between [[Blanche of Castile]], his niece, and [[Louis the Lion]], Philip's son (1200). In 1203, John captures Arthur, who eventually dies (act 4, scene 3).

===Charles VI===

In act 4, scene 1, during the coronation of Henry VI (1429), the Yorkists wear white roses on their hats, while the Lancastrians wear red roses, prefiguring the [[War of the Roses]] (1455–1485). In act 5 scene 6, Joan of Arc is condemned to be burnt alive, but no mention is made of her trial (1431). In the first scene of ''Henry VI part 2'', King Henry VI of England marries [[Margaret of Anjou]] in 1445, of the [[House of Valois]], niece to King Charles VII, arranged by the marquis of Suffolk, [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]] as a way to influence the young king through her. In the marriage contract, the English lose the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine and no dowry is given ([[Treaty of Tours]], 1445). In the final scene, the Yorkists are victorious after the [[First Battle of St Albans]] (1455) during the [[War of the Roses]]. In the first scene of ''Henry VI part 3'', the Yorkists confront the supporters of Henry VI, who discuss whether the king should accept the issue of the duke of York as king. Queen Margaret refuses to accept that her son, Edward, be disinherited. With her principal commander, [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset]], she fights successfully for a while the Yorkists but is eventually defeated by them, whereby the son of [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]], is proclaimed [[King Edward IV of England]] and she sent away to France (1461).

&lt;/ref&gt; The table below lists the scores of the PISA 2009 assessment in mathematics and reading by country, as well as the difference between boys and girls. Gaps in bold font mean that the gender gap is [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] ([[p value|p]]&lt;0.05). A positive mathematics gap means that boys outperform girls, a negative mathematics gap means that girls outperform boys. A positive reading gap means that girls outperform boys (no country has a negative reading gap). There is a negative [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between the mathematics and reading gender gaps, that is, nations with a larger mathematics gap have a smaller reading gap and vice versa.&lt;ref name="stoetgeary2013-se"/&gt;

[[Image:US-GeophysicalFluidDynamicsLaboratory-Logo.svg|right|180px]]
The '''Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory''' ('''GFDL''') is a laboratory in the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR). The current director is Dr. [[Venkatachalam Ramaswamy]]. It is one of seven NOAA Research Laboratories (RLs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NOAA Research Laboratories |publisher = NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research |date = |url = http://ci.noaa.gov/NOAAResearchLaboratories.aspx |accessdate = 2014-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GFDL is engaged in comprehensive long lead-time research to expand the scientific understanding of the physical processes that govern the behavior of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and the [[ocean]]s as [[Fluid mechanics|complex fluid systems]]. These systems can then be modeled mathematically and their [[Empirical research|phenomenology]] can be studied by computer simulation methods.

GFDL's accomplishments include the development of the first climate models to study global warming, the first comprehensive ocean prediction codes, and the first dynamical models with significant skill in hurricane track and intensity predictions. Much current research within the laboratory is focused around the development of Earth System Models for assessment of natural and human-induced climate change.

==Major accomplishments==
*The first global numerical simulations of the atmosphere — defining the basic structure of the numerical weather prediction and climate models that are still in use today throughout the world.&lt;ref name="NOAA Magazine Article on GFDL"&gt;{{cite web|title=NOAA Magazine Article on GFDL|url=http://www.magazine.noaa.gov/stories/mag104.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415022846/http://www.magazine.noaa.gov/stories/mag104.htm|archivedate=2012-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The first numerical simulation of the world ocean.&lt;ref name="NOAA Magazine Article on GFDL"/&gt;
*The initial definition and further elaborations of many of the central issues in global warming research, including water vapor feedback, polar amplification of temperature change, summer mid-continental dryness and cloud feedback.&lt;ref name="NOAA Magazine Article on GFDL"/&gt;
*The first coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models and the first simulations of global warming using these models (including the above feedback processes and the potential weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation).&lt;ref name="NOAA Magazine Article on GFDL"/&gt;
*The development of a state-of-art hurricane model and its transfer to operations in the NOAA National Weather Service and the Navy.&lt;ref name="NOAA Magazine Article on GFDL"/&gt;

== Scientific groups ==
The GFDL has a diverse community of about 300 researchers, collaborators and staff, with many from Britain, India, China, Japan, France, etc. The laboratory is currently organized into several scientific groups (listed alphabetically below) as well as a large computer support group.

===Atmospheric physics, chemistry and climate===
Current head: Dr. Hiram Levy II

This group focuses on processes that affect the vertical structure of the atmosphere, such as convection and radiation. A particular focus is the role of aerosols in climate, both through direct effects on the radiative balance, and indirect effects on cloud physics.

===Climate and ecosystems===
Current head: Ron Stouffer

This group focuses on interactions between the physical climate
and biogeochemical systems, both in the land and ocean. Development of GFDL's Earth System Model is centered in this group.

===Climate diagnostics===
Current head: Dr. Ngar-Chung (Gabriel) Lau

This group focuses on comparing models with observations, developing observational datasets that can be compared with models, and using models to isolate key processes that regulate interannual variability in the ocean and atmosphere.

===Climate change, variability and prediction===
Current head: Dr. Tom Delworth

The largest group in the lab centers on the development
of numerical models for predictions and projections of climate
on seasonal-to-centennial time scales. Major projects include the development of El Nino predictions for seasonal forecasting, and the production of IPCC-class climate models.

===Oceans and climate ===
Current head: Dr. Robert Hallberg

This group focuses on the role played by the oceans in the large-scale climate system, and on developing state-of-the-art numerical codes to simulate the ocean.

===Weather and atmospheric dynamics===
Current head: Dr. [[Isaac Held]]

This group focuses on the dynamics of the atmosphere, with particular emphasis on the interactions between waves and turbulence and the large-scale flow. Development of GFDL's hurricane model is supported from this group.

== Facilities ==
The GFDL is located at [[Princeton University]]'s Forrestal Campus in Princeton, NJ.

Since March 2011, the GFDL no longer possesses an on-site [[supercomputer]]. They instead utilize a [[massively parallel]] [[Cray]] supercomputer with over 30,000 [[processor core]]s  which is currently located at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], [[Tennessee]]. This contrasts from their previous systems architecture, which consisted of eight [[Silicon Graphics]] [[Altix]] computers, each housing 1024 [[processor core]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCRC website|url=http://www.ncrc.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hardware updates occur on average, every 18 months.

The GFDL has been using high-performance computing systems to perform numerical modeling since the 1950s.

== Alumni ==
* [[Joseph Smagorinsky]]: GFDL's first director
* [[Jerry Mahlman]]: GFDL's second director
* Ants Leetmaa: GFDL's third director
* [[Kirk Bryan (American Oceanographer)]]
* [[Syukoro Manabe]]
* Yoshio Kurihara

'''Hill tribe''' ({{lang-th|ชาวดอย, ชาวเขา, คนเขา,}}, {{IPA-th|tɕʰāːw.dɔ̄ːj, tɕʰāːw.kʰǎw, kʰōn.kʰǎw}}) ([[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]]: จาวดอย, คนดอย, {{IPA-nod|t͡ɕāːw.dɔ̄ːj, xōn.dɔ̄ːj}}; "mountain people/folk")&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;[http://www.thai-language.com/id/226017 English-Thai dictionary entry for "hill tribe"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tumsorn|first1=Maneewan|last2=Chansiriyotin|first2=Supaporn|title=Northern-Central Thai Dictionary (Revised Edition)|date=1986|publisher=Peace Corps/Thailand|location=Thailand|url=http://www.livelingua.com/peace-corps/Thai/Northern-Central%20Thai%20Dictionary.pdf|accessdate=5 June 2014|language=English, Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used in Thailand for all of the various [[ethnic group]]s who mostly inhabit the high mountainous [[Northern Thailand|Northern]] and [[Western Thailand|Western]] regions of [[Thailand]], including both sides of the border areas between Northern Thailand, [[Laos]] and [[Burma]], the [[Phi Pan Nam Range]], the [[Thanon Range]], the latter a southern prolongation of the [[Shan Hills]], as well as the [[Tenasserim Hills]] in [[Western Thailand]]. These areas are known for their often mountainous terrain which is in some areas covered by thick forests, while in others it has been heavily affected by [[deforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/archive/Thailand.htm Forest data: Thailand Deforestation Rates]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hill dwelling peoples have traditionally been primarily [[subsistence farmers]] who use [[slash-and-burn]] [[agricultural]] techniques to farm their heavily [[forest]]ed communities.&lt;ref name=Highlanders-Intro&gt;{{cite book|last=Geddes|first=W. R.|title=Highlanders of Thailand|year=1983|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Kuala Lumpur|editor=John McKinnon and Wanat Bhruksasri|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular perceptions that slash and burn practices are environmentally destructive, government concerns over borderland security, and population pressure has caused the government to forcibly relocate many hill tribe peoples.&lt;ref name="Border Lanscapes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturgeon|first=Janet C.|title=Border Landscapes: The Politics of Akha Land Use in China and Thailand|year=2005|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, hill tribes were also a migratory people, leaving land as it became depleted of [[natural resource]]s or when trouble arose. Cultural and adventure travel tourism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alienadv.com/activityDetails/1204/Trekking-with-Hill-Tribes-in-North-Thailand/|title=Trekking with Hill Tribes in North Thailand|website=www.alienadv.com|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in visiting the tribal villages is an increasing source of income for the hill tribes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/bangkok/life/gallery-thailands-longneck-women-controversial-tourist-attraction-154136/|title=Gallery: Thailand's 'longneck' women, a controversial tourist attraction {{!}} CNN Travel|website=travel.cnn.com|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; though its ethicacy is often debated.

A 2013 article in ''[[Bangkok Post]]'' said that "Nearly a million hill peoples and forest dwellers are still treated as outsiders—criminals even, since most live in protected forests. Viewed as national security threats, hundreds of thousands of them are refused citizenship although many are natives to the land".&lt;ref name=Thainess&gt;[http://bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/366720/time-ripe-for-whole-new-take-on-thainess Time ripe for whole new take on 'Thainess']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The term "hill tribe"==
In the 19th century, the tribes living in the mountain ranges were the largest non-Buddhist group in Thailand. Their mountain locations were then considered remote and difficult to access.&lt;ref name="Sukrittaya"/&gt; In Thai official documents, the term ''hill tribe'' (''Chao Khao'') began to appear in the 1960s. This term highlights a ''Hill and Valley'' [[dichotomy]] that is based on an ancient social relationship existing in most of [[Thai Highlands|Northern]] and [[Western Thailand]], as well as in [[Sipsongpanna]] and [[Northern Vietnam]]. For the most part, the [[Dai people|Dai]]/[[Tai peoples|Tai]]/[[Thai people]] occupied the more fertile [[intermontane basin]]s and the valleys, while the less powerful groups lived in the poorer, higher altitudes. This dichotomy was often also characterized by a master/[[Serfdom|serf relationship]].&lt;ref&gt;Kusuma Snitwongse &amp; W Scott Thompson eds. ''Ethnic Conflicts in Southeast Asia'', Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (October 14, 2005) {{ISBN|978-9812303370}}, pg. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, ''Highland Thais'' is a more recent term also used to designate groups living in the mountainous areas.&lt;ref name="Sukrittaya"&gt;Sukrittaya Jukping, ''Mae Khru Khong Chaat: A study of women teachers of Thai hilltribe children.'' University of Iowa, 2008, {{ISBN|9780549750161}}, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven major hill tribes within Thailand are the [[Akha people|Akha]], [[Lahu people|Lahu]], [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Hmong people|Hmong/Miao]], [[Yao people|Mien/Yao]], [[Lisu people|Lisu]], [[Palaung people|Palaung]] each with a distinct language and culture.

===The Akha===

{{main|Akha people}}

The Akha are closely related to the [[Hani people|Hani]] of China's [[Yunnan]] province.&lt;ref name=Hilltribe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/|title=The Akha|publisher=HillTribe.org|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known derogatorily in [[Thai language|Thai]] as the Gaw or the E-gaw. The Akha are one of the dominant cultural influences in the area. There are two to three million Akha and Akha-Hani in total, 70,000 of whom live in Thailand. The Akha speak a language in the Lolo/Yi branch of the [[Tibeto-Burman]] language group, but have no traditional written language.

Although many Akha, especially younger people, profess [[Christianity]], Akha Zang (The Akha Way) still runs deep in their consciousness. The Akha are a shamanic group that share the ancient universal archetype that the Goddess spins a universe where nature is not distinguished from humankind. They embody the essence of its consciousness into a holistic continuum where there is no dichotomy between themselves and the natural world. The Akha Way, a prescribed lifestyle derived from religious chants, combines [[animism]], [[ancestor worship]], shamanism and a deep relationship with the land. The Akha Way emphasizes [[rituals]] in everyday life and stresses strong family ties and the hymn of creation; every Akha male can recount his [[genealogy]] back over fifty generations to the first Akha, Sm Mi O. AFECT NGO ([http://www.akhathai.org akhathai.org]) is the oldest [[non-governmental organization]] for tribes in Asia helping to protect the deeply shamanic tribal culture. Akha Asia ([http://www.akhaasia.org akhaasia.org]) runs an Akha cultural school.

The Bwa G'Naw,({{Lang-ksw|ပှၤကညီကစၢၢ်ခိၣ်}}) known to many as Karen, and to others as [[Kariang]] or Yang, are one of the largest hill tribes in [[Southeast Asia]]. The total population of Karen people is unknown, since they are spread throughout Burma, Laos and Thailand, and no reliable census has been conducted in Burma since the 1930s. Population estimates range from 7.5 million to 14 million people. (The more conservative estimate makes their population equivalent to that of Switzerland). The approximately 320,000 Karen in Thailand comprise half of the country's total hill tribe population.

While the Karen still practice slash and burn farming as other hill tribes do, they differ in that they live in permanent villages at lower elevations and have been aggressive in developing environmentally sustainable terraced rice fields. These factors have allowed the Karen to better integrate themselves into Thai society.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

===The Hmong===

{{main|Hmong people}}

The Hmong are believed to have been the original inhabitants of the [[Yellow River Valley]] in ancient China. The expansion of the neighboring Chinese from the north, caused a disruption in the Hmong culture and forced them to migrate southwards to Laos and Vietnam to escape oppression and persecution. Over the centuries, many wars have been waged against the Chinese. Greatly outnumbered, the Hmong suffered heavy casualties.

The futile efforts to establish themselves as an independent people apart from the expanding Chinese led to their mass exodus further south of China, and eventually into Southeast Asia. From here, they made their way into the territories of the European colonies that later gained independence and became known as Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar. While the Hmong came to inhabit the hillside of Thailand because of helping the Americans fight the Vietnam War and lost, the country had always maintained its sovereignty from the colonists.

Today, the Hmong are located in the [[Thai Highlands]], although some are found elsewhere within the country. Among the hilltribes, the Hmong are becoming well integrated into Thai society as well as being among the most successful. The current population of Hmong in Thailand is estimated to be roughly 151,080.

'''Hip-hop based education''' ('''HHBE''') refers to the use of [[hip hop music|hip-hop]], especially [[rapping|rap]] songs and lyrics, as curricular resources.

Integrating hip-hop into academic curriculum gives youth more interest in education and promotes literacy.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} HHBE advocates believe that hip-hop can be used in classrooms to inspire youth to be agents of social and political.&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, Ernest.

===The Hip-hop Education Guidebook===
[[Marcella Runell Hall|Marcella Runell]] and [[Martha Diaz]] created the "Hip-Hop Education Guidebook: Volume 1", a comprehensive collection of lesson plans and resources that educators can use to integrate hip-hop into their classroom curriculum. The book concept was inspired by Diaz, who founded and curated the Hip-Hop Education Summit with Patricia Wang. The lessons include subjects such as mathematics, science, social justice, literacy, and language arts. The education guide introduces teachers to the many ways that hip-hop education can be used in the classroom and it also validated teachers who had previously implemented hip-hop into their curriculum. Hip-Hop Association published the work and Runell stated that the response has been "tremendous."&lt;ref name="Kirkland, David E 2008"&gt;Kirkland, David E.

===Hip-hop Educational Literacy Program (H.E.L.P)===
[[Asheru]], born Gabriel Benn, director of Arts in Education at a D.C. based special education school with the help of Rick Henning launched the H.E.L.P program. It's a monthly periodical and reading supplement designed by teachers and curriculum writers to combine hip-hop music with literacy instruction. Songs for the periodical are chosen based on three criteria, the first being "the song must be socially redeeming or otherwise significant themes addressed in the songs lyrical content, followed by rich vocabulary use, and lastly the song must be performed by a popular artist.&lt;ref name="Kirkland, David E 2008"/&gt;

===Trials of a Hip-hop Educator===
In 2007 Tony Muhammad started a popular Myspace blog titled "Trials of a Hip-hop Educator". Teachers who were implementing hip-hop into their classrooms could go to this blog and share their struggles with each other.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Hip Hop Schoolhouse===
Hip-hop artist [[Common (rapper)|Common]], with the help of his mother, Dr. Mahalia Hines, developed a self-help hip-hop series of three books—all written by Common—that were released under the company name Hip Hop Schoolhouse. Dr. Hines, with the help of her education colleagues has also created lesson plans and units on how to teach the series to youth. Each book also includes a hip-hip vocabulary dictionary in the back for teachers who are not familiar with hip-hop language.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

{{History of art sidebar}}

The '''history of art''' focuses on objects made by humans in visual form for [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] purposes. [[Visual art]] [[art#Forms, genres, media and styles|can be classified in diverse ways]], such as separating [[fine art]]s from [[applied arts]]; inclusively focusing on human creativity; or focusing on different media such as [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[film]], [[photography]], and [[graphic arts]].  In recent years, technological advances have led to [[video]] art, [[Digital art|computer art]], [[Performance art]], [[animation]], [[television]], and [[Video game|videogames]].

The history of art is often told as a chronology of [[masterpiece]]s created during each [[civilization]]. It can thus be framed as a story of [[high culture]], epitomized by the [[Wonders of the World]]. On the other hand, [[vernacular]] art expressions can also be integrated into art historical narratives, referred to as [[folk arts]] or [[craft]]. The more closely that an art historian engages with these latter forms of [[low culture]], the more likely it is that they will identify their work as examining [[visual culture]] or [[material culture]], or as contributing to fields related to art history, such as [[anthropology]] or [[archaeology]]. In the latter cases art objects may be referred to as [[Artifact (archaeology)|archeological artifacts]].

{{Main|Prehistoric art}}

The oldest human art that has been found dates to the [[Stone Age]], when the first creative works were made from shell, stone, and paint. During the Paleolithic (25,000–8,000&amp;nbsp;BCE), humans practiced [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] and lived in [[cave]]s, where [[cave painting]] was developed.{{sfn|Gardner|Kleiner|2009|p=2}} During the Neolithic period (6000–3000&amp;nbsp;BCE), the production of [[handicrafts]] commenced.

The earliest human artifacts showing evidence of workmanship with an artistic purpose are the subject of some debate. It is clear that such workmanship  existed by 40,000 years ago in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era, although it is quite possible that it began earlier. Engraved shells created by [[homo erectus]] dating as far back as 500,000 years ago have been found, although experts disagree on whether these engravings can be properly classified as ‘art’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429983.200-shell-art-made-300000-years-before-humans-evolved.html |title=Shell 'art' made 300,000 years before humans evolved |journal=[[New Scientist]] |first=Catherine |last=Brahic |date=3 December 2014 |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:F07 0054.Ma.JPG|thumb|''[[Bison Licking Insect Bite]]'', in carved [[antler]], Museum of Prehistory, [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]]]]
The [[Paleolithic]] had its first artistic manifestation in 25,000&amp;nbsp;BCE, reaching its peak in the [[Magdalenian]] period (±15,000–8,000&amp;nbsp;BCE). Surviving art from this period includes small carvings in stone or bone and [[cave painting]]. The first traces of human-made objects appeared in southern [[Africa]], the [[Western Mediterranean]], [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] ([[Adriatic Sea]]), [[Siberia]] ([[Baikal Lake]]), India and Australia. These first traces are generally worked stone ([[flint]], [[obsidian]]), wood or [[bone]] tools. To [[painting|paint]] in [[red]], [[iron oxide]] was used.  Cave paintings have been found in the [[Franco-Cantabrian region]]. There are pictures that are [[Abstract art|abstract]] as well as pictures that are [[naturalism (visual art)|naturalistic]].  Animals were painted in the caves of [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]], [[Trois Frères]], [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] and [[Lascaux]]. [[Sculpture]] is represented by the so-called ''[[Venus figurines]]'', feminine figures which may have been used in [[fertility cult]]s, such as the ''[[Venus of Willendorf]]''.{{sfn|Gardner|Kleiner|2009|p=3-4}} There is a theory that these figures may have been made by women as expressions of their own body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCoid|first1=Catherine Hodge|last2=McDermott|first2=Leroy D.|date=1996|title=Toward Decolonizing Gender: Female Vision in the Upper Paleolithic|jstor=682890|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=98|issue=2|pages=319–326|doi=10.1525/aa.1996.98.2.02a00080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other representative works of this period are the ''Man from [[Brno]]''&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=A World History of Art|author1=Honour, H.|author2=Fleming, J.|date=2005|publisher=Laurence King|isbn=9781856694513|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qGb4pyoseH4C&amp;pg=PT38|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Venus of Brassempouy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Honour-Fleming (2002), p. 36-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesolithic===
{{Hatnote|Main article: [[Mesolithic]]}}

In Old World archaeology, Mesolithic ([[Ancient Greek language|Greek]]: μέσος, ''mesos'' "middle"; λίθος, ''lithos'' "stone") is the period between
the [[Upper Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]]. The term [[Epipaleolithic]] is often used synonymously, especially for outside [[northern Europe]], and for the corresponding period in [[Epipaleolithic Near East|the Levant]] and [[Epipaleolithic Caucasus|Caucasus]].
The Mesolithic has different time spans in different parts of Eurasia.
It refers to the final period of [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures in Europe and West Asia, between the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] and the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. In Europe it spans roughly 15,000 to 5,000&amp;nbsp;BP, in Southwest Asia (the [[Epipalaeolithic Near East]]) roughly 20,000 to 8,000&amp;nbsp;BP.
The term is less used of areas further east, and not all beyond Eurasia and North Africa.

The Neolithic period began in about 8,000 BCE. The [[rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]]—dated between the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras—contained small, schematic paintings of human figures, with notable examples in [[Roca dels Moros|El Cogul]], Valltorta, [[Alpera]] and Minateda.

Neolithic painting is similar to paintings found in northern Africa ([[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]], Sahara) and in the area of modern Zimbabwe. Neolithic painting is often schematic, made with basic strokes (men in the form of a [[cross]] and women in a [[triangle|triangular]] shape). There are also cave paintings in [[Pinturas River]] in [[Argentina]], especially the [[Cueva de las Manos]]. In [[portable art]], a style called [[Cardium Pottery]] was produced, decorated with imprints of [[seashell]]s. New materials were used in art, such as [[amber]], [[crystal]], and [[jasper]]. In this period, the first traces of urban planning appeared, such as the remains in [[Jericho#Tell es-Sultan|Tell as-Sultan]] ([[Jericho]]), [[Jarmo]] (Iraq) and [[Çatalhöyük]] ([[Anatolia]]).{{sfn|Onians|2004|p=20-25}} In South-Eastern Europe appeared many cultures, such as the [[Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]] and the [[Hamangia culture]], from [[Romania]], [[Republic of Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]]. Another region with many cultures is China most notable being the [[Yangshao culture]] and the [[Longshan culture]].

===Metal Age===

The last prehistoric phase is the Metal Age (or [[Three-age system]]), during which the use of [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[iron]] transformed ancient societies. When humans could smelt metal and forge metal implements could make new tools, weapons, and art.

In the [[Chalcolithic]] (Copper Age) [[megalith]]s emerged. Examples include the [[dolmen]] and [[menhir]] and the [[England|English]] [[wikt:cromlech|cromlech]], as can be seen in the complexes at [[Newgrange]] and [[Stonehenge]].{{sfn|Gardner|Kleiner|2009|p=12}} In Spain the [[Los Millares]] culture was formed which was characterized by the [[Beaker culture]]. In [[Malta]], the [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|temple complexes]] of [[Ħaġar Qim]], [[Mnajdra]], [[Tarxien Temples|Tarxien]] and [[Ġgantija]] were built. In the [[Balearic Islands]] notable megalithic cultures developed, with different types of monuments: the ''[[naveta]]'', a tomb shaped like a truncated [[pyramid]], with an elongated burial chamber; the ''[[taula]]'', two large stones, one put vertically and the other horizontally above each other; and the ''[[talaiot]]'', a tower with a covered chamber and a false [[dome]].&lt;ref&gt;Azcárate (1983), pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Iron Age]] the cultures of [[Hallstatt]] (Austria) and [[La Tene]] ([[Switzerland]]) emerged in Europe. The first was developed between the 7th and 5th century BCE by the [[List of necropoleis|necropoleis]] with tumular tombs and a wooden burial chamber in the form of a house, often accompanied by a four-wheeled cart. The pottery was [[Polychrome|polychromic]], with [[geometry|geometric]] decorations and applications of metallic ornaments. La Tene was developed between the 5th and 4th century BCE, and is more popularly known as early [[Celtic art]]. It produced many iron objects such as [[sword]]s and [[spear]]s, which have not survived well to the 2000s due to rust.

The [[Bronze Age]] refers to the period when bronze was the best material available.  Bronze was used for highly decorated [[shield]]s, [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulas]], and other objects, with different stages of evolution of the style. Decoration was influenced by [[Art in Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] and [[Scythian art]].{{sfn|Onians|2004|p=30-31}}

[[File:Gudea of Lagash Girsu.jpg|thumb|left||[[Statues of Gudea|Diorite Statue I]], patesi of [[Lagash]]; 2120&amp;nbsp;BCE; [[Louvre]] (Paris)]]
In the first period of recorded history, art coincided with [[writing]]. The great civilizations of the [[Near East]]: [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] arose. Globally, during this period the first great cities appeared near major rivers: the [[Nile]], [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], [[Indus]] and [[Yellow River|Yellow]] Rivers.

One of the great advances of this period was writing, which was developed from the tradition of communication using pictures. The first form of writing were the [[Jiahu symbols]] from neolithic China, but the first true writing was [[cuneiform script]], which emerged in Mesopotamia c. 3500&amp;nbsp;BCE, written on [[clay]] tablets. It was based on [[Pictogram|pictographic]] and [[Ideogram|ideographic]] elements, while later Sumerians developed [[syllable]]s for writing, reflecting the [[phonology]] and [[syntax]] of the [[Sumerian language]]. In Egypt [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] was developed using pictures as well, appearing on art such as the [[Narmer Palette]] (3,100&amp;nbsp;BCE). The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] sculpted seals with short texts and decorated with representations of animals and people. Meanwhile, the [[Olmecs]] sculpted [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]] and decorated other sculptures with [[Olmecs#Writing|their own hierglyphs]].

[[Mesopotamian art]] was developed in the area between [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] Rivers in modern day Syria and Iraq, where since the 4th millennium BCE many different cultures existed such as [[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Amorite]] and [[Chaldea]]. [[Architecture of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian architecture]] was characterized by the use of [[brick]]s, [[lintel (architecture)|lintels]], and [[cone mosaic]]. Notable are the [[ziggurat]]s, large [[temple]]s in the form of [[step pyramid]]s. The tomb was a chamber covered with a false [[dome]], as in some examples found at [[Ur]]. There were also [[palace]]s walled with a terrace in the form of a ziggurat, where gardens were an important feature. The [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

[[Relief]] sculpture was developed in [[wood carving|wood]] and [[stone]]. Sculpture depicted religious, military, and hunting scenes, including both human and animal figures. In the [[Sumer]]ian period, small statues of people were produced. These statues had an angular form and were produced from colored stone. The figures typically had bald head with hands folded on the chest. In the Akkadian period, statues depicted figures with long hair and beards, such as the [[stele]] of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]]. In the Amorite period (or Neosumerian), statues represented kings from [[Gudea]] of [[Lagash]], with their mantle and a turban on their heads and their hands on their chests. During Babylonian rule, the stele of [[Hammurabi]] was important, as it depicted the great king Hammurabi above a written copy of the laws that he introduced. Assyrian sculpture is notable for its [[anthropomorphism]] of cattle and the [[winged genie]], which is depicted flying in many reliefs depicting war and hunting scenes, such as in the [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III|Black Obelisk]] of [[Shalmaneser III]].&lt;ref&gt;Azcárate (1983), pp. 36–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mummy mask of [[Tutankhamun]] is perhaps the most iconic object to suvive from ancient Egypt]]
One of the first great civilizations arose in [[Egypt]], which had elaborate and complex works of art produced by professional artists and craftspeople. Egypt's art was religious and symbolic. Given that the culture had a highly centralized power structure and hierarchy, a great deal of art was created to honour the [[pharaoh]], including great monuments. Egyptian art and culture emphasized the religious concept of immortality. Later Egyptian art includes [[Coptic art|Coptic]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] art.

The [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|architecture]] is characterized by monumental structures, built with large stone blocks, lintels, and solid [[column]]s. Funerary monuments included [[mastaba]], tombs of rectangular form; [[pyramid]]s, which included step pyramids ([[Saqqarah]]) or smooth-sided pyramids ([[Giza]]); and the [[hypogeum]], underground tombs ([[Valley of the Kings]]). Other great buildings were the [[temple]], which tended to be monumental complexes preceded by an avenue of [[sphinx]]es and [[obelisk]]s. Temples used [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] and [[trapezoid]] walls with [[hypaethros]] and [[hypostyle]] halls and [[shrine]]s. The temples of [[Karnak]], [[Luxor]], [[Philae]] and [[Edfu]] are good examples. Another type of temple is the [[rock temple]], in the form of a [[hypogeum]], found in [[Abu Simbel]] and [[Deir el-Bahari]].

Painting of the Egyptian era used a juxtaposition of overlapping planes. The images were represented hierarchically, i.e., the Pharaoh is larger than the common subjects or enemies depicted at his side. Egyptians painted the outline of the head and limbs in profile, while the torso, hands, and eyes were painted from the front. [[Applied arts]] were developed in Egypt, in particular [[Cabinet making|woodwork]] and [[Goldsmith|metalwork]]. There are superb examples such as [[cedrus|cedar]] furniture [[Inlay|inlaid]] with [[ebony]] and [[ivory]] which can be seen in the tombs at the [[Egyptian Museum]]. Other examples include the pieces found in [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb, which are of great artistic value.&lt;ref&gt;Azcárate (1983), pp. 29–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovered long after the contemporary civilizations of [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Egypt]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] or Harappan civilization (circa 2400–1900 BC) is now recognized as extraordinaly advansed, comparable in many ways with those cultures.

Various sculptures, seals, bronze vessels [[Indian Pottery|pottery]], gold jewellery, and anatomically detailed figurines in [[terracotta]], bronze, and steatite have been found at excavation sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC|first=Jane|last=McIntosh|page=248|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of gold, terracotta and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some dance form. These terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. The animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified. Part bull, part zebra, with a majestic horn, it has been a source of speculation. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultic significance, but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the IVC are religious symbols.&lt;ref name="Keay, John 2000"&gt;Keay, John, India, a History.  New York: Grove Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Marshall (archaeologist)|Sir John Marshall]] reacted with surprise when he saw the famous Indus bronze statuette of a slender-limbed [[Dancing Girl (sculpture)|dancing girl]] in Mohenjo-daro:

{{quote|When I first saw them I found it difficult to believe that they were prehistoric; they seemed to completely upset all established ideas about early art, and culture. Modeling such as this was unknown in the ancient world up to the Hellenistic age of Greece, and I thought, therefore, that some mistake must surely have been made; that these figures had found their way into levels some 3000 years older than those to which they properly belonged&amp;nbsp;.... Now, in these statuettes, it is just this anatomical truth which is so startling; that makes us wonder whether, in this all-important matter, Greek artistry could possibly have been anticipated by the sculptors of a far-off age on the banks of the Indus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India discovered|page=172|publisher=Collins|author=John Keay|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Seals have been found at [[Mohenjo-daro]] depicting a figure standing on its head, and another sitting cross-legged in what some call a [[yoga]]-like pose (see image, the so-called ''Pashupati'', below).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} This figure, sometimes known as a [[Pashupati seal|Pashupati]], has been variously identified. Sir John Marshall identified a resemblance to the Hindu god, Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Sir John. Mohenjo-Daro and the Indus Civilisation, 3 vols, London: Arthur Probsthain, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; If this can be validated, it would be evidence that some aspects of Hinduism predate the earliest texts, the Veda.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Greek art|Greek]] and [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] artists built on the artistic foundations of Egypt, further developing the arts of sculpture, painting, architecture, and ceramics. Greek art started as smaller and simpler than Egyptian art, and the influence of Egyptian art on the Greeks started in the Cycladic islands between 3300–3200 BCE. [[Cycladic art|Cycladic]] statues were simple, lacking facial features except for the nose.

Greek art eventually included life-sized statues, such as [[Kouros]] figures. The standing Kouros of Attica is typical of early Greek sculpture and dates from 600 BCE. From this early stage, the art of Greece moved into the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Period]]. Sculpture from this time period includes the characteristic [[Archaic smile]]. This distinctive smile may have conveyed that the subject of the sculpture had been alive or that the subject had been blessed by the gods and was well.

Phoenician art lacks unique characteristics that might distinguish it from its contemporaries. This is due to its being highly influenced by foreign artistic cultures: primarily [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], Greece and [[Assyria]]. Phoenicians who were taught on the banks of the [[Nile]] and the [[Euphrates]] gained a wide artistic experience and finally came to create their own art, which was an amalgam of foreign models and perspectives. Even so, Phoenician influenced other styles, inclusive [[Iberian sculpture]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1879/01/05/81740354.pdf|title=Phoenician Art|format=PDF|work = The New York Times |accessdate=2008-06-20 | date=1879-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article from ''[[The New York Times]]'' published on January 5, 1879, Phoenician art was described by the following:

{{bquote|He entered into other men's labors and made most of his heritage. The [[Sphinx]] of Egypt became [[Asian people|Asiatic]], and its new form was transplanted to [[Nineveh]] on the one side and to Greece on the other. The rosettes and other patterns of the [[Babylonia]]n cylinders were introduced into the handiwork of Phoenicia, and so passed on to the West, while the hero of the ancient [[Chaldea]]n epic became first the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] [[Melkart]]h, and then the [[Herakles]] of Hellas.}}

=== Etruscan ===

[[Etruscan art]] was produced by the [[Etruscan civilization]] in [[central Italy]] between the 9th and 2nd centuries BCE. From around 600 BCE it was heavily influenced by [[Greek art]], which was imported by the Etruscans, but always retained distinct characteristics.  Particularly strong in this tradition were figurative sculpture in terracotta (especially life-size on [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] or temples), wall-painting and [[metalworking]] especially in bronze. Jewellery and [[engraved gem]]s of high quality were produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |last=Boardman |first=John |author-link=John Boardman (art historian) |title=The Oxford History of Classical Art |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1993 |pages=350–351 |isbn=0198143869 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=pcDpAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etruscan sculpture in cast bronze was famous and widely exported, but relatively few large examples have survived (the material was too valuable, and recycled later).  In contrast to terracotta and bronze, there was relatively little Etruscan sculpture in stone, despite the Etruscans controlling fine sources of marble, including [[Carrara marble]], which seems not to have been exploited until the Romans.

The great majority of survivals came from tombs, which were typically crammed with [[sarcophagi]] and [[grave goods]], and terracotta fragments of architectural sculpture, mostly around temples.  Tombs have produced all the [[fresco]] wall-paintings, which show scenes of feasting and some narrative mythological subjects.

[[Dacian art]] is the art associated with the peoples known as [[Dacians]] or ''North [[Thracians]]''; The Dacians created an art style in which the influences of [[Scythians]] and the Greeks can be seen. They were highly skilled in gold and silver working and in pottery making. Pottery was white with red decorations in flolral, geometric, and stylized animal motifs. Similar decorations were worked in metal, especially the figure of a horse, which was common on Dacian coins.{{sfn| Waldman| Mason |2006|p=208}} Today, a big collection of Dacic masterpieces is in the [[National Museum of Romanian History]] ([[Bucharest]]), one of the most famous being the [[Helmet of Coțofenești]].

The Geto-Dacians lived in a very large territory, stretching from the [[Balkans]] to the northern [[Carpathians]] and from the [[Black Sea]] and the river [[Tyras]] to the [[Tisza|Tisa]] plain, sometimes even to the [[Middle Danube]].{{sfn|MacKenzie|1986|p=25}} Between 15th-12th century, the Dacian-Getae culture was influenced by the Bronze Age Tumulus-Urnfield warriors.{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}}

Pre-Roman Iberian art refers to the styles developed by the [[Iberians]] from the [[Bronze age]] up to the [[Roman conquest of Hispania|Roman conquest]].  For this reason it is sometimes described as "Iberian art".

Almost all extant works of Iberian sculpture visibly reflect [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Phoenicia]]n influences, and [[Assyria]]n, [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Egypt]]ian influences from which those derived; yet they have their own unique character. Within this complex stylistic heritage, individual works can be placed within a spectrum of influences- some of more obvious Phoenician derivation, and some so similar to Greek works that they could have been directly imported from that region. Overall the degree of influence is correlated to the work's region of origin, and hence they are classified into groups on that basis.

=== Hittite ===
{{main|Hittite art}}
[[File:IvrizRelief.JPG|thumb|left|The ''[[İvriz relief]]'', king [[Warpalawas]] (right) before the god [[Tarhunzas]]]]
Hittite art was produced by the [[Hittites|Hittite civilization]] in ancient [[Anatolia]], in modern-day [[Turkey]], and also stretching into [[Syria]] during the second millennium BCE from the nineteenth century up until the twelfth century BCE. This period falls under the Anatolian [[Bronze Age]]. It is characterized by a long tradition of canonized images and motifs rearranged, while still being recognizable, by artists to convey meaning to a largely illiterate population. &lt;blockquote&gt;“Owing to the limited vocabulary of figural types [and motifs], invention for the Hittite artist usually was a matter of combining and manipulating the units to form more complex compositions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sculpture and Sculptors of Yazılıkaya|last=Alexander|first=Robert L.|publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Newark|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Many of these recurring images revolve around the depiction of [[Hittite mythology and religion|Hittite deities and ritual practices]]. There is also a prevalence of hunting scenes in Hittite relief and representational animal forms. Much of the art comes from settlements like [[Alaca Höyük]], or the Hittite capital of [[Hattusa]] near modern-day [[Boğazkale]]. Scholars do have difficulty dating a large portion of Hittite art, citing the fact that there is a lack of inscription and much of the found material, especially from burial sites, was moved from their original locations and distributed among museums during the nineteenth century.

The Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex is the modern archaeological designation for a [[Bronze Age]] [[civilization]] of [[Central Asia]], dated to c. 2300–1700 BCE, located in present-day northern [[Afghanistan]], eastern [[Turkmenistan]], southern [[Uzbekistan]] and western [[Tajikistan]], centred on the upper [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus River). Its sites were discovered and named by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] archaeologist [[Viktor Sarianidi]] (1976).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

BMAC materials have been found in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], on the [[Iranian Plateau]], and in the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name="LambergKarlovskyArchaeology"&gt;C.C. Lamberg-Karlovsky, "Archaeology and Language: The Indo-Iranians", ''Current Anthropology'', vol. 43, no. 1 (Feb.  2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Finds within BMAC sites provide further evidence of trade and cultural contacts. They include an Elamite-type cylinder seal and a [[Harappa]]n seal stamped with an elephant and Indus script found at Gonur-depe.{{sfn|Kohl|2007|pp=196–199}} The relationship between Altyn-Depe and the Indus Valley seems to have been particularly strong. Among the finds there were two [[Harappa]]n seals and ivory objects. The Harappan settlement of [[Shortugai]] in Northern Afghanistan on the banks of the [[Amu Darya]] probably served as a trading station.&lt;ref name="MassonThe"&gt;V. M. Masson, "The Bronze Age in Khorasan and Transoxiana," chapter 10 in A.H. Dani and Vadim Mikhaĭlovich Masson (eds.), ''History of civilizations of Central Asia'', volume 1: ''The dawn of civilization: earliest times to 700 BCE'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous type of Bactrian artworks are the "Bactrian pricesses". Wearing large stylized dresses with puffed sleeves, as well as headdresses that merge with the hair, they embody the ranking goddess, character of the central Asian mythology that plays a regulatory role, pacifying the untamed forces.

=== Celtic ===
{{main|Celtic art}}

Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as [[Celts]]; those who spoke the [[Celtic languages]] in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period. It also refers to the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.

Celtic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the [[Bronze Age]], and indeed the preceding [[Neolithic age]]; however archaeologists generally use "Celtic" to refer to the culture of the [[European Iron Age]] from around 1000 BCE onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about "Celtic art" only from the [[La Tène]] period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BCE) onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, for example; see their introductory section, where they explain the situation &amp; that their article will only cover the La Tène period.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Celtic art is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/project_archive/technologies_of_enchantment.aspx |title=Technologies of Enchantment: Early Celtic Art in Britain |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804214909/http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/project_archive/technologies_of_enchantment.aspx |archive-date=2012-08-04 |publisher=[[British Museum]]}} It is also used by Jacobsthal; however the equivalent "Late Celtic art" for Early Medieval work is much rarer, and "Late Celtic art" can also mean the later part of the prehistoric period.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Early Medieval]] art of Britain and Ireland, which produced the [[Book of Kells]] and other masterpieces, and is what "Celtic art" evokes for much of the general public in the English-speaking world, is called [[Insular art]] in art history.  This is the best-known part, but not the whole of, the Celtic art of the Early Middle Ages, which also includes the Pictish art of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 6–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Achaemenid art includes [[frieze]] reliefs, metalwork, decoration of palaces, glazed brick masonry, fine craftsmanship (masonry, carpentry, etc.), and gardening. Most survivals of court art are monumental sculpture, above all the [[relief]]s, double animal-headed [[Persian column]] capitals and other sculptures of [[Persepolis]] (see below for the few but impressive Achaemenid rock reliefs).&lt;ref name="Cotterell, 161–162"&gt;Cotterell, 161–162&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Persians took artists, with their styles and techniques, from all corners of their empire, they produced not simply a combination of styles, but a synthesis of a new unique Persian style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Edward Lipiński, Karel van Lerberghe, Antoon Schoors|author2=Karel Van Lerberghe|author3=Antoon Schoors| title = Immigration and emigration within the ancient Near East| url = https://books.google.com/?id=thIxCmwfNoMC| year = 1995| publisher = Peeters Publishers| isbn = 978-90-6831-727-5| page = 119 }}; Cotterell, 162&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus the Great in fact had an extensive ancient Iranian heritage behind him; the rich Achaemenid gold work, which inscriptions suggest may have been a specialty of the Medes, was for instance in the tradition of earlier sites.

There are a number of very fine pieces of jewellery or inlay in precious metal, also mostly featuring animals, and the  [[Oxus Treasure]] has a wide selection of types.  Small pieces, typically in gold, were sewn to clothing by the elite, and a number of gold [[torc]]s have survived.&lt;ref name="Cotterell, 161–162"/&gt;

[[Roman art]] is sometimes viewed as derived from Greek precedents, but also has its own distinguishing features. Roman sculpture is often less idealized than the Greek precedents, being very realistic. Roman architecture often used [[concrete]], and features such as the round [[arch]] and [[dome]] were invented.

Roman artwork was influenced by the nation-state's interaction with other people's, such as ancient [[Judea]]. A major monument is the Arch of Titus, which was erected by the Emperor Titus. Scenes of Romans looting the Jewish temple in Jerusalem are depicted in low-relief sculptures around the arch's perimeter.

[[Ancient Roman pottery]] was not a luxury product, but a vast production of "fine wares" in ''[[terra sigillata]]'' were decorated with reliefs that reflected the latest taste, and provided a large group in society with stylish objects at what was evidently an affordable price. [[Roman coins]] were an important means of propaganda, and have survived in enormous numbers.

In Byzantine and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] art of the [[Middle Ages]], the dominance of the church resulted in a large amount of religious art.  There was extensive use of gold in paintings, which presented figures in simplified forms.

Anglo-Saxon art covers art produced within the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] period of English history, beginning with the [[Migration period art|Migration period]] style that the Anglo-Saxons brought with them from the continent in the 5th century, and ending in 1066 with the [[Norman Conquest]] of a large Anglo-Saxon nation-state whose sophisticated art was influential in much of northern Europe.  The two periods of outstanding achievement were the 7th and 8th centuries, with the metalwork and jewellery from [[Sutton Hoo]] and a series of magnificent illuminated manuscripts, and the final period after about 950, when there was a revival of English culture after the end of the [[Viking]] invasions.  By the time of the Conquest the move to the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style is nearly complete.  The important artistic centres, in so far as these can be established, were concentrated in the extremities of England, in [[Northumbria]], especially in the early period, and [[Wessex]] and [[Kent]] near the south coast.

====Ottonian art====
{{main|Ottonian art}}
[[File:Kreuzmitdengroßen Senkschmelzen.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The ''[[Essen cross with large enamels]]''; part of the [[Essen Cathedral Treasury]]]]
Ottonian art is a [[style (visual arts)|style]] in [[Pre-Romanesque art|pre-romanesque]] [[German art]], covering also some works from the [[Low Countries]], northern Italy and eastern France. It was named by the art historian [[Hubert Janitschek]] after the [[Ottonian dynasty]] which ruled Germany and northern Italy between 919 and 1024 under the kings [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], [[Otto I]], [[Otto II]], [[Otto III]] and [[Emperor Henry II|Henry II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://arthistorians.info/janitschekh |title=Dictionary of Art Historians: Janitschek, Hubert |access-date=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Ottonian architecture]], it is a key component of the [[Ottonian Renaissance]] (circa 951–1024).  However, the style neither began nor ended to neatly coincide with the rule of the dynasty.  It emerged some decades into their rule and persisted past the Ottonian emperors into the reigns of the early [[Salian dynasty]], which lacks an artistic "style label" of its own.&lt;ref name="Suckale-Redlefsen, 524"&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 524&lt;/ref&gt;  In the traditional scheme of art history, Ottonian art follows [[Carolingian art]] and precedes [[Romanesque art]], though the transitions at both ends of the period are gradual rather than sudden.  Like the former and unlike the latter, it was very largely a style restricted to a few of the small cities of the period, and important [[monastery|monasteries]], as well as the court circles of the emperor and his leading [[vassal]]s.

====Viking art====
{{main|Viking art}}
Viking art, also known commonly as Norse art, is a term widely accepted for the [[art]] of [[Scandinavia]]n [[Norsemen]] and [[Vikings|Viking]] settlements further afield—particularly in the [[British Isles]] and [[Iceland]]—during the [[Viking Age]] of the 8th-11th centuries CE. Viking art has many design elements in common with [[Celtic Art|Celtic]], [[Migration Period art|Germanic]], the later [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and Eastern European art, sharing many influences with each of these traditions.&lt;ref&gt;*Maurizio Tani, ''Le origini mediterranee ed eurasiatiche dell’arte vichinga.

{{main|Culture of ancient Rus}}
Slavic architecure is a mix of [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and Pagan architecture. Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers. Most iconic buildings are the [[Russian architecture|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian culture#Architecture|Ukrainian]] cathedrals. These cathedrals are well known for their unsusual [[onion domes]], which are decorated with geometric and colorful patterns. It is not completely clear when and why onion domes became a typical feature of [[Russian architecture]]. [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine churches]] and the [[architecture of Kievan Rus]] were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles. Russian architecture used the dome shape not only for churches but also for other buildings.

[[South Slavs|South Slavic]] art was highly influenced by Byzantine art and architecture, more than the [[East Slavs]]. They were also influenced by Greek culture, but not really much.

The use and making of icons entered [[Kievan Rus']] following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman ([[Byzantine]]) Empire in 988 AD. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians—notably [[Andrei Rublev]] and [[Dionisius]]—widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when [[Simon Ushakov]]'s painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.

===Renaissance and Baroque===

The [[Renaissance]] is the return to a valuation of the material world, and this paradigm shift is reflected in art forms, which show the corporeality of the human body, and the three-dimensional reality of [[landscape]]s. Art historians often [[Art periods|periodize]] Renaissance art by century, especially with [[Italian art]]. [[Italian Renaissance]] and [[Baroque art]] is traditionally referred to by centuries: [[trecento]] for the fourteenth century, [[quattrocento]] for the fifteenth, [[cinquecento]] for the sixteenth, and [[seicento]] for the seventeenth.

The art of [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] is related to that of neighbouring cultures. Pre-Islamic [[Yemen]] produced stylized [[alabaster]] heads of great aesthetic and historic charm.  Most of the pre-Islamic sculptures are made of [[alabaster]].

[[Archaeology]] has revealed some early settled civilizations in [[Saudi Arabia]]: the [[Dilmun]] civilization on the east of the Arabian Peninsula, [[Thamud]] north of the [[Hejaz]], and [[Kindah]] kingdom and [[Al-Magar]] civilization in the central of Arabian Peninsula.
The earliest known events in Arabian history are migrations from the peninsula into neighbouring areas.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Khuri Hitti (2002), History of the Arabs, Revised: 10th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; In antiquity, the role of [[South Arabia]]n societies such as Saba ([[Sheba]]) in the production and trade of aromatics not only brought such kigdoms wealth but also tied the [[Arabian peninsula]] into trade networks, resulting in far-ranging artistic influences.

It seems probable that before around 4000 BCE the Arabian climate was somewhat wetter that today, benefitting from a monsoon system that has since moved south.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} During the late fourth millennium BCE permanent settlements began to appear, and inhabitants adjusted to the emerging dryer conditions. In south-west Arabia (modern [[Yemen]]) a moister climate supported several kingdoms during the second and first millennia BCE. The most famos of these is [[Sheba]], the kingdom of the biblical [[Queen of Sheba]]. These societies used a combination of trade in spices and the natural resources of the region, including aromatics such as frankincense and myrrh, to build wealthy kingdoms. [[Ma'rib#Ancient|Mārib]], the [[Sabaeans|Sabaean]] capital, was well positioned to tap into Mediterranean as well as Near Eastern trade, and in kingdoms to the east, in what is today [[Oman]], trading links with [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persia]] and even India were possible. The area was never a part of the [[Assyria]]n or [[Persian empire]]s, and even [[Babylon]]ian control of north-west Arabia seems to have been relatively short-lived. Later Roman attempts to control the region's lucrative trade foundered. This impenetrability to foreign armies doubtless augmented ancient rulers' bargaining power in the spice and incense trade.

Although subject to external  influences, south Arabia retained characteristics particular to itself. The human figure is typically based on strong, square shapes, the fine modeling of detail contrastingwith a stylized simplicity of form.

Some branches of Islam [[Aniconism in Islam|forbid depictions of people]] and other sentient beings, as they may be misused as idols. Religious ideas are thus often represented through geometric designs and [[calligraphy]]. However, there are many Islamic paintings which display religious themes and scenes of stories common among the three Abrahamic [[monotheistic]] faiths of [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], and [[Judaism]].

The influence of [[Chinese ceramics]] has to be viewed in the broader context of the considerable importance of Chinese culture on [[Islamic art]]s in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/press/exhibitions/2012/chinese-ceramics-on-great-hall-balcony |first=Denise Patry |last=Leidy |title=Evolution of Chinese Ceramics and Their Global Influence are Theme of Entirely New Installation on Metropolitan Museum's Great Hall Balcony |work=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |date=14 September 2012 |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[İznik pottery]] (named after [[İznik]], a city from [[Turkey]]) is one of the best well-known types of Islamic pottery.

The art of the Eskimo people from Siberia is in the same style as the [[Inuit art]] from [[Alaska]] and north Canada. This is because the Native Americans traveled through Siberia to Alaska, and later to the rest of the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Including the [[Russian Far East]], the population of [[Siberia]] numbers just above 40 million people. As a result of the 17th-to-19th-century [[Russian conquest of Siberia]] and the subsequent [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|population movements during the Soviet era]], the [[demographics of Siberia]] today is dominated by native speakers of [[Russian language|Russian]]. There remain a considerable number of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] groups, between them accounting for below 10% of total Siberian population, which are also genetically related to [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas]].

At a height of {{cvt|11|in|cm|0|order=flip}}, it is one of the largest jade objects ever found in Mesoamerica, [[American Museum of Natural History]]]]
The history of art in the Americas begins in [[Pre-Columbian art|pre-Columbian]] times with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous cultures]]. Art historians have focused particularly closely on [[Mesoamerica]] during this early era, because a series of stratified cultures arose there that erected grand architecture and produced [[Mesoamerica#Political and religious art|objects of fine workmanship]] that are comparable to the arts of Western Europe.

===Preclassic===
The art-making tradition of Mesoamerican people begins with the [[Olmec#Art|Olmec]] around 1400&amp;nbsp;BCE, during the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Preclassic era]]. These people are best known for making [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]] but also carved [[jade]], erected monumental architecture, made small-scale sculpture, and designed mosaic floors. Two of the most well-studied sites artistically are [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] and [[La Venta]]. After the Olmec culture declined, the [[Maya civilization]] became prominent in the region. Sometimes a transitional [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] period is described, which is a hybrid of Olmec and Maya. A particularly well-studied Epi-Olmec site is [[La Mojarra]], which includes hieroglyphic carvings that have been partially deciphered.

===Classic===
[[File:Mascara Dios Murcielago.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] mosaic mask that represents a Bat god, made of 25 pieces of jade, with yellow eyes made of shell. It was found in a tomb at [[Monte Alban]]]]
By the late pre-Classic era, beginning around 400&amp;nbsp;BCE, the Olmec culture had declined but both Central Mexican and Maya peoples were thriving. Throughout much of the Classic period in Central Mexico, the city of [[Teotihuacan]] was thriving, as were [[Xochicalco]] and [[El Tajin]]. These sites boasted grand sculpture and architecture. Other Central Mexican peoples included the [[Mixtec#Language, codices, and artwork|Mixtecs]], the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]], and people in the [[Valley of Oaxaca]]. [[Maya art]] was at its height during the “Classic” period—a name that mirrors that of [[Classical antiquity|Classical European antiquity]]—and which began around 200 CE. Major Maya sites from this era include [[Copan]], where numerous stelae were carved, and [[Quirigua]] where the largest stelae of Mesoamerica are located along with [[zoomorphic]] altars. A complex [[writing system]] was developed, and [[Maya codices|Maya illuminated manuscripts]] were produced in large numbers on paper made from [[Bark (botany)|tree bark]]. Many sites [[Maya collapse|”collapsed”]] around 1000 CE.

===Postclassic===
At the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] during the 16th and 17th centuries, the Maya were still powerful, but many communities were paying tribute to [[Aztec society]]. The latter culture was thriving, and it included [[Aztec#Arts|arts]] such as sculpture, painting, and feather mosaics. Perhaps the most well-known work of Aztec art is the [[Aztec sun stone|calendar stone]], which became a national symbol of the state of [[Mexico]]. During the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], many of these artistic objects were sent to Europe, where they were placed in [[cabinets of curiosities]], and later redistributed to Western art museums. The Aztec empire was based in the city of [[Tenochtitlan]] which was largely destroyed during the colonial era. What remains of it was buried beneath [[Mexico City]]. A few buildings, such as the foundation of the [[Templo Mayor]] have since been unearthed by archaeologists, but they are in poor condition.

===Art in the Americas===
Art in the Americas since the conquest is characterized by a mixture of indigenous and foreign traditions, including those of European, African, and Asian settlers. Numerous indigenous traditions thrived after the conquest. For example, the [[Plains Indians]] created [[quillwork]], [[beadwork]], [[winter count]]s, [[ledger art]], and [[tipi]]s in the pre-reservation era, and afterwards became assimilated into the world of Modern and Contemporary art through institutions such as the [[Santa Fe Indian School]] which encouraged students to develop a unique Native American style. Many paintings from that school, now called the Studio Style, were exhibited at the [[Philbrook Museum of Art]] during its Indian annual held from 1946 to 1979.

Arising from the humblest beginnings as a nomadic group of "uncivilizated" wanderers, the Aztecs created the largets empire in Mesoamerican history, lasting from 1427/1428 to 1521. Tribute from conquered states provided the economic and artistic resources to tranform their capital [[Tenochtitlan]] (0ld [[Mexico City]]) into one of the wonders of the world. Artists from throught mesoamerica creted stunning artworks for their new maters, fashioning delicate golden objects of personal adornment and formidable sculptures of firece gods.

The Aztecs entered the Valley of Mexico (the area of modern [[Mexico City]]) in 1325 and within a centry had taken control of this lush  region brimming with powerful city-states.

Ancient Maya art refers to the material arts of the [[Maya civilization]], an eastern and south-eastern [[Mesoamerica]]n culture that took shape in the course of the later [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic Period]] (500 BCE to 200 CE). Its greatest artistic flowering occurred during the seven centuries of the {{C|Mayan Classic Period|Classic Period}} (c. 200 to 900 CE). Ancient Maya art then went through an extended Post-Classic phase before the upheavals of the sixteenth century destroyed courtly culture and put an end to the Mayan artistic tradition. Many regional styles existed, not always coinciding with the changing boundaries of Maya polities. [[Olmec]]s, [[Teotihuacan]] and [[Toltec]]s have all influenced Maya art. Traditional art forms have mainly survived in weaving and the design of peasant houses.

=== Costa Rica &amp; Panama ===

Long considered a backwater of culture and aesthetic expression, Central America's dynamic societies are now recognized as robust and innovative contribuitors to the arts of ancient Americas. The people of pre-Columbian Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama developed their own distinctive styles in spite of the region being a crossroads for millennia. Its peoples were not subsumed by outside influences but instead created, adopted and adapted al manner of ideas and technologies to suit their needs and temperaments. The region's isiosyncratic cultural traditions, religious beliefs and sociopolitical systems are reflected in unique artworks. A fundamental spiritual tenet was shamanism, the central principle of which decreedthat in a trance state, transformed into one's spirit companion form, a person could enter the supranatural realm and garner special power to affect worldly affairs. Central American artists devised ingenious ways to portray this transformation by merging into one figure human and animal characteristics; the [[jaguar]], [[Snake|serpent]] and avian raport (falcon, eagle or vulture) were the main spirit forms.

[[Gold]] — the perpetually brilliant metal of status, wealth and power — inspired the Spanish to explore the globe and was an essential accoutrement of prestige, authority and religious ideology among the people of Central America and Colombia.

In Colombia, gold was important for it's relationship to thedivine force of the sun. It was part of a complex ideology of universal binary oppositions: male-female, light-dark, the earth and spirit worlds. Gold body adornments were cast in complex forms, their iconography communicating social, political and spiritual potency through portrayals of powerful shaman-rulers, lineage totems and supranatural protector spirits.

The tropical climate of the Caraibbean islands and the Amazonian rainforest is not favorable to the preservation of artefacts made from wood and other materials. What survived reveals complex societies whose people created art rich in mythological and spiritual meaning.

The [[Taino people]], who occupied the Caraibbean islands when the Spanish arrived, were agriculturalists whose society was centred on hereditary chiefs called ''[[cacique]]s''. Their towns included impressively constructed ceremonial plazas in which ball games were played and religious rituals carried on, linking their culture to that of the Maya from the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. Much of Taino art was associated with shamanic rituals and religion, including a ritual in which a shaman or a ''cacique'' enters into a hypnotic state by inhaling the hallucinogetic ''[[cohoba]]'' powder. Sculptures representing the creator god Yocahu often depict a nude male figure in a squatting position with a slightly concave dish on top of his head, to hold the ''cohoba'' powder. Other figures (always male) stand rigidly frontal, the ostentatious display of their genitals apparently to the importance of fertility. The prupose of these rituals was communication with the ancestors and the spirit world. Chiefs and shamans (often the same person) sometimes interceded with spirit beings from a sculpted stool, or ''duho''.

Meanwhile, the [[Marajoara culture]] flourished on [[Marajó|Marajó island]] at the mouth of the [[Amazon River]], in Brazil. Archeologists have found sophisticated [[pottery]] in their excavations on the island. These pieces are large, and elaborately painted and incised with representations of plants and animals. These provided the first evidence that a complex society had existed on Marajó. Evidence of [[mound building]] further suggests that well-populated, complex and sophisticated settlements developed on this island, as only such settlements were believed capable of such extended projects as major earthworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grann|first=David|title=The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon|page=315|year=2009|isbn=978-0-385-51353-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery that they made is decorated with abastract lines and spirals, suggesting that they probably consumed hallucinogetic plants. The Marajoara culture produced many kinds of vessels including urns, jars, bottles, cups, bowls, plates and dishes.

Inuit art refers to [[Work of art|artwork]] produced by [[Inuit]] people, that is, the people of the Arctic previously known as [[Eskimo]]s, a term that is now often considered offensive outside [[Alaska]]. Historically, their preferred medium was [[walrus ivory]], but since the establishment of southern markets for Inuit art in 1945, [[Printmaking|prints]] and figurative works carved in relatively soft stone such as [[soapstone]], [[serpentinite]], or [[argillite]] have also become popular. The range of colors is cold, most encountered being: black, brown, grays, white and gray-blue.

The [[Winnipeg Art Gallery]] claims to have the largest public collection of contemporary Inuit art in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[ https://www.wag.ca/about/facts/history]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[Museum of Inuit Art]] opened in [[Toronto]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miagallery.ca Museum of Inuit Art]&lt;/ref&gt; but closed due to lack of resources in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/canadian-museum-of-inuit-art-closing-1.3541737 'Small but mighty' Canadian Museum of Inuit Art closing its doors]&lt;/ref&gt; Carvings Nunavut, owned by Inuk Lori Idlout, opened in 2008 and has grown to have the largest private collection in Nunavut.

{{main|Eastern art history}}[[File:The Great Wave off Kanagawa.jpg|thumb|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'' by [[Hokusai]]]]
[[Eastern world|Eastern civilization]] broadly includes Asia, and it also includes a complex tradition of art making. One approach to [[Eastern art history]] divides the field by nation, with foci on [[Indian art]], [[Chinese art]], and [[Japanese art]]. Due to the size of the continent, the distinction between Eastern Asia and Southern Asia in the context of arts can be clearly seen. In most of Asia, pottery was a prevalent form of art. The pottery is often decorated with geometric patterns or abstract representations of animals, people or plants. Another very widespread form of art was, and is, sculpture.

=== Central Asia ===
{{main|Central Asia#Arts|Scythian art}}[[File:Ceremonial hanging IMA 50671.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremonial hanging (suzani); late 1700s; cotton; 92 x 63{{fraction|1|4}} in.; from [[Uzbekistan]]; [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (USA)]]
Superb samples of [[Steppes art]] – mostly golden jewellery and trappings for horse – are found over vast expanses of land stretching from [[Hungary]] to [[Mongolia]]. Dating from the period between the 7th and 3rd centuries BCE, the objects are usually diminutive, as may be expected from nomadic people always on the move. Art of the steppes is primarily an [[animal style|animal art]], i.e., combat scenes involving several animals (real or imaginary) or single animal figures (such as golden stags) predominate. The best known of the various peoples involved are the [[Scythians]], at the European end of the steppe, who were especially likely to bury gold items.

Among the most famous finds was made in 1947, when the Soviet archaeologist [[Sergei Rudenko]] discovered a royal burial at [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk]], [[Altay Mountains]], which featured – among many other important objects – the most ancient extant [[pile rug]], probably made in Persia.  Unusually for prehistoric burials, those in the northern parts of the area may preserve organic materials such as wood and textiles that normally would decay.  Steppes people both gave and took influences from neighbouring cultures from Europe to China, and later Scythian pieces are heavily influenced by ancient Greek style, and probably often made by Greeks in Scythia.

The [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] made anthropomorphic figures. Most famous are the ''[[Dancing Girl (sculpture)|Dancing Girl]]'' and the ''[[Priest-King (figure)|Priest-King]]''. This civilisation made also many [[clay]] pots, most of them decorated with geometric patterns. They made seals decorated with animals, anthropomorphic figures and [[indus script|their script]]. The Indus script (also known as the Harappan script) is a corpus of symbols produced by the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] during the [[Kot Diji]] and [[Mature Harappan]] periods between 3500 and 1900 BCE. Most inscriptions containing these symbols are extremely short, making it difficult to judge whether or not  these symbols constituted a [[Writing system|script]] used to record a language, or even symbolise a [[writing system]].&lt;ref name="Locklear"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Mallory |last1=Locklear |quote="After a century of failing to crack an ancient script, linguists turn to machines." |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14371450/indus-valley-civilization-ancient-seals-symbols-language-algorithms-ai |title=Science: Machine learning could finally crack the 4,000-year-old Indus script |work=[[The Verge]] |location=Manhattan, New York |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of many attempts,&lt;ref&gt;(Possehl, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; the "script" has not yet been deciphered, but efforts are ongoing. There is no known [[bilingual inscription]] to help decipher the script, nor does the script show any significant changes over time.  However, some of the syntax (if that is what it may be termed) varies depending upon location.&lt;ref name="Locklear"/&gt;

Early [[Buddhists]] in India developed symbols related to [[Buddha]]. Bhutanese painted "[[thangkas]]" that shows Buddhist iconography. The major survivals of Buddhist art begin in the period after the Mauryans, from which good quantities of sculpture survives from some key sites such as [[Sanchi]], [[Bharhut]] and [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati]], some of which remain ''in situ'', with others in museums in India or around the world.  Stupas were surrounded by ceremonial fences with four profusely carved [[torana]]s or ornamental gateways facing the cardinal directions. These are in stone, though clearly adopting forms developed in wood. They and the walls of the stupa itself can be heavily decorated with reliefs, mostly illustrating the lives of the Buddha. Gradually life-size figures were sculpted, initially in deep relief, but then free-standing.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 26–47, 105–117&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Mathura]] was the most important centre in this development, which applied to Hindu and Jain art as well as Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 59–70&lt;/ref&gt;  The facades and interiors of rock-cut ''[[chaitya]]'' prayer halls and monastic ''[[vihara]]s'' have survived better than similar free-standing structures elsewhere, which were for long mostly in wood. The caves at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], [[Karla Caves|Karle]], [[Bhaja Caves|Bhaja]] and elsewhere contain early sculpture, often outnumbered by later works such as iconic figures of the Buddha and [[bodhisattva]]s, which are not found before 100 CE at the least.

=== Nepalese, Bhutanese &amp; Tibetan ===
{{Main|Nepalese art|Bhutanese art|Tibetan art}}

For more than a thousand years, [[Tibetan art]]ists have played a key role in the cultural life of Tibet. From designs for painted furniture to elaborate murals in religious buildings, their efforts have permeated virtually every facet of life on the [[Tibetan plateau]]. The vast majority of surviving artworks created before the mid-20th century are dedicated to the depiction of religious subjects, with the main forms being [[thangka]], [[distemper (paint)|distemper]] paintings on cloth, [[Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings]], and small statues in bronze, or large ones in clay, [[stucco]] or wood. They were commissioned by religious establishments or by pious individuals for use within the practice of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and were manufactured in large workshops by monks and lay artists, who are mostly unknown.

The art of Tibet may be studied in terms of influences which have contributed to it over the centuries, from other [[Chinese art|Chinese]], [[Newa art|Nepalese]], [[Indian art|Indian]], and [[sacred art|sacred]] styles. Many bronzes in Tibet that suggest [[Pala Empire|Pala]] influence, are thought to have been either crafted by Indian sculptors or brought from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://himalayanbuddhistart.wordpress.com/2016/10/16/pala-india-maitreya-standing/ |title=Pala India, Maitreya – standing |date=October 16, 2016 |access-date=29 September 2018 |work=Himalayanbuddhistart |publisher=[[WordPress.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhutanese art]] is similar to the [[art of Tibet]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], with its pantheon of divine beings. The major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu|Kagyu School]] and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma order is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]], who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find. The [[Terton|treasure finders]] ([[Terton|''tertön'']]) are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.

In Eastern Asia, painting was derived from the practice of calligraphy, and portraits and landscapes were painted on silk cloth. Most of the paintings represent landscapes or portraits. The  most spectacular sculptures are the [[Chinese ritual bronzes|ritual bronzes]] and the bronze sculptures from [[Sanxingdui]]. A very well-known example of Chinese art is the ''[[Terracotta Army]]'', depicting the armies of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first Emperor of China. It is a form of [[funerary art]] buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife.

Chinese art is one of the oldest continuous traditional arts in the world, and is marked by an unusual degree of continuity within, and consciousness of, that tradition, lacking an equivalent to the Western collapse and gradual recovery of classical styles. The media that have usually been classified in the West since the [[Renaissance]] as the [[decorative arts]] are extremely important in Chinese art, and much of the finest work was produced in large workshops or factories by essentially unknown artists, especially in [[Chinese ceramics]].

===Japanese===
{{main|Japanese art}}[[File:Kitagawa Utamaro - Toji san bijin (Three Beauties of the Present Day)From Bijin-ga (Pictures of Beautiful Women), published by Tsutaya Juzaburo - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Three Beauties of the Present Day]]'' (japanese: 当時三美人); by [[Kitagawa Utamaro]] c. 1793; height: 3.87 cm (15.23 in), width: 2.62 cm (10.31 in); [[Toledo Museum of Art]] ([[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Ohio]])]]
[[Japanese art]] covers a wide range of art styles and media, including [[Jōmon Pottery|ancient pottery]], [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]], [[Ink wash painting|ink painting]] and [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]] on silk and paper, ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' paintings and [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]], ceramics, [[origami]], and more recently [[manga]]—modern Japanese [[cartoon]]ing and comics—along with a myriad of other types. It has a long history, ranging from the beginnings of human habitation in Japan, sometime in the 10th millennium BCE, to the present.

The first settlers of Japan, the [[Jōmon]] people (c. 11,000–300 BCE). They crafted [[Jomon pottery|lavishly decorated pottery storage vessels]], clay figurines called ''[[dogū]]''. Japan has been subject to sudden invasions of new ideas followed by long periods of minimal contact with the outside world. Over time the Japanese developed the ability to absorb, imitate, and finally assimilate those elements of foreign culture that complemented their aesthetic preferences. The earliest complex art in Japan was produced in the 7th and 8th centuries in connection with [[Buddhism]]. In the 9th century, as the Japanese began to turn away from China and develop indigenous forms of expression, the secular arts became increasingly important; until the late 15th century, both religious and secular arts flourished. After the [[Ōnin War]] (1467–1477), Japan entered a period of political, social, and economic disruption that lasted for over a century. In the state that emerged under the leadership of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], organized religion played a much less important role in people's lives, and the arts that survived were primarily secular.

[[Korean art]]s include traditions in &lt;!--(alphabetical:)--&gt;calligraphy, music, painting and pottery, often marked by the use of natural forms, surface decoration and bold colors or sounds.

The earliest examples of Korean art consist of [[stone age]] works dating from 3000 BCE. These mainly consist of [[votive offering|votive sculptures]] and more recently, [[petroglyph]]s, which were rediscovered.

This early period was followed by the art styles of various Korean kingdoms and dynasties. Korean artists sometimes modified [[Chinese art|Chinese traditions]] with a native preference for simple elegance, spontaneity, and an appreciation for purity of nature.

The [[Goryeo]] Dynasty (918–1392) was one of the most prolific periods for a wide range of disciplines, especially pottery.

The Korean art market is concentrated in the [[Insadong]] district of [[Seoul]] where over 50 small galleries exhibit and occasional fine arts auctions. Galleries are cooperatively run, small and often with curated and finely designed exhibits. In every town there are smaller regional galleries, with local artists showing in traditional and contemporary media. Art galleries usually have a mix of media. Attempts at bringing Western conceptual art into the foreground have usually had their best success outside of Korea in New York, San Francisco, London and Paris.

=== Vietnamese ===
{{main|Vietnamese art}}[[File:ThienMuPagoda.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pagoda of the Celestial Lady]] ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: ''Chùa Thiên Mụ''; also called ''Linh Mụ Pagoda'') in [[Huế]], built in 1601]]
Vietnamese art has a long and rich history, the earliest examples of which date back as far as the [[Stone Age]] around 8,000 [[BCE]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

With the millennium of [[History of Vietnam|Chinese domination]] starting in the 2nd century BCE, Vietnamese art undoubtedly absorbed many Chinese influences, which would continue even following independence from China in the 10th century CE.  However, Vietnamese art has always retained many distinctively Vietnamese characteristics.

By the 19th century, the influence of [[French art]] took hold in Vietnam, having a large hand in the birth of modern Vietnamese art.

=== Thai ===
{{main|Thai art}}
[[File:WatPhraKeaw Ramayana Chariot.JPG|450px|thumb|[[Hanuman]] on his chariot, a scene from the [[Ramakien]] in [[Wat Phra Kaew]] ([[Bangkok]])]]

Traditional Thai art is primarily composed of [[Buddhist art]] and scenes from the Indian epics. Traditional Thai [[sculpture]] almost exclusively depicts [[Buddha image|images of the Buddha]], being very similar with the other styles from [[Southeast Asia]], such as [[Cambodian art|Khmer]]. Traditional Thai [[painting]]s usually consist of book illustrations, and painted ornamentation of buildings such as [[palace]]s and [[temple]]s. Over time, thai art was influenced by the other Asian styles, most by [[Indian art|Indian]] and [[Cambodian art|Khmer]]. Thai sculpture and painting, and the royal courts provided patronage, erecting temples and other religious shrines as acts of merit or to commemorate important events.

The history of Cambodian art stretches back centuries to ancient times, but the most famous period is undoubtedly the Khmer art of the [[Khmer Empire]] (802–1431), especially in the area around [[Angkor]] and the mainly 12th-century temple-complex of [[Angkor Wat]], initially [[Hindu]] and subsequently [[Buddhist]]. After the collapse of the empire these and other sites were abandoned and overgrown, allowing much of the era's stone carving and architecture to survive to the present day. Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include [[textiles]], non-textile [[weaving]], [[silversmithing]], [[stone carving]], [[lacquerware]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wat]] [[murals]], and [[kite]]-making.

Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.

In pre-colonial Cambodia, art and crafts were generally produced either by rural non-specialists for practical use or by skilled artists producing works for the Royal Palace. In modern Cambodia, many artistic traditions entered a period of decline or even ceased to be practiced, but the country has experienced a recent artistic revival as the tourist market has increased and governments and NGOs have contributed to the preservation of Cambodian culture.

Indonesia also has experienced a long [[History of Indonesia|history]], with each period leaves a distinctive arts. From [[Prehistoric Indonesia|prehistoric]] cave paintings and [[megalithic]] ancestral statues of Central Sulawesi, tribal wooden carving traditions of [[Toraja]] and [[Asmat people]], graceful Hindu-Buddhist art of classical Javanese civilization which produced [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]], vivid [[Balinese Painting|Balinese paintings]] and [[Balinese dance|performing arts]], [[Islamic art]]s of [[Aceh]], to contemporary arts of modern Indonesian artists. Both Indonesian diversity and history add to complexity on defining and identifying what is Indonesian art.

African art includes both [[African sculpture|sculpture]], typified by the brass castings of the [[Benin art|Benin people]], as well as [[African folk art|folk art]]. Concurrent with the European Middle Ages, in the eleventh century CE a nation that made grand architecture, gold sculpture, and intricate jewelry was founded in [[Great Zimbabwe]]. Impressive sculpture was concurrently being cast from brass by the [[Yoruba art|Yoruba people]] of what is now Nigeria. Such a culture grew and was ultimately transformed to become the [[Benin art|Benin Kingdom]], where elegant altar tusks, brass heads, plaques of brass, and palatial architecture was created. The Benin Kingdom was ended by the British in 1897, and little of the culture's art now remains in Nigeria. Today, the most significant arts venue in Africa is the [[Johannesburg Biennale]].

The Art of Oceania includes the geographic areas of [[Micronesia]], [[Polynesia]], Australia, New Zealand, and [[Melanesia]]. One approach treats the area thematically, with foci on [[ancestry]], warfare, the body, gender, trade, religion, and [[tourism]]. Unfortunately, little ancient art survives from Oceania. Scholars believe that this is likely because artists used perishable materials, such as wood and feathers, which did not survive in the tropical climate, and there are no historical records to refer to most of this material. The understanding of Oceania's artistic cultures thus begins with the documentation of it by Westerners, such as Captain [[James Cook]], in the eighteenth century. At the turn of the twentieth century the French artist [[Paul Gauguin]] spent significant amounts of time in Tahiti, living with local people and making modern art—a fact that has become intertwined with Tahitian visual culture to the present day.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} The indigenous [[Australian art|art of Australia]] often looks like abstract modern art, but it has deep roots in local culture.

The art of [[Oceania]] is the last great tradition of art to be appreciated by the world at large. Despite being one of the longest continuous traditions of art in the world, dating back at leasf fifty millennia, it remained relatively unknown until the second half of the 20th century.

The often ephemeral materials of Aboriginal art of Australia makes it difficult to determine the antiquity of the majority of the forms of art practised today. The most durable forms are the multitudes of rock engravings and rock paintings which are found across the continent. In the Arnhem Land escarpment, evidence suggests that paintings were being made fifty thousand years ago, antedating the Palaeolithic rock paintings of [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] &amp; [[Lascaux]] in Europe.

===Origins===

Art historians disagree when [[Modern art]] began, some tracing it as far back as [[Francisco Goya]] in the [[Napoleonic]] period, the mid-19th century with the [[industrial revolution]] or the late 19th century with the advent of [[Impressionism]]. The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 gave rise to further revolutions in thought. In the arts, these included a new self-consciousness about artistic styles and individuality.&lt;ref&gt;Ozenfant, A. (1952). ''Foundations of Modern Art''. New York: Dover Publications. pp. 2–5. {{OCLC|536109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[H. Harvard Arnason]] says "a gradual metamorphosis took place in the course of a hundred years", marked by significant events such as the completion in 1784 of [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s painting ''[[The Oath of the Horatii]]''; the exhibition of [[Gustave Courbet]]'s painting ''[[The Artist's Studio]]'' in 1855; and the exhibition of [[Édouard Manet]]'s painting ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' in the ''[[Salon des Refusés]]'' in Paris in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Arnason, H.

During the 19th century, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] tendency of early modern artists such as [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] was succeeded by newer art movements: [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]],  [[Impressionism]], [[post-Impressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], and other movements. Western artists were influenced by Eastern decorative arts, especially [[Japonism|Japanese prints]].

The Impressionists sought to convey movement, spontaneity, and transient effects of light in their work. Their style was adopted by artists in many countries, alongside national movements such as the [[Hudson River School]] and the [[Ashcan School]] in the US.

===Early 20th century===

The history of [[20th-century art]] is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. The art movements of [[Fauvism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], [[abstract art]], [[Dada]]ism and [[Surrealism]] led to further explorations of new creative styles and manners of expression. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art, such as [[Pablo Picasso]] being influenced by [[Iberian sculpture]], [[African art|African sculpture]] and [[Primitivism]]. [[Japonism]], and Japanese [[woodcut]]s (which had themselves been influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on Impressionism and subsequent artistic developments. The influential example set by [[Paul Gauguin]]'s interest in [[Oceanic art]] and the sudden popularity among the [[Connoisseur|cognoscenti]] in early 20th century Paris of newly discovered African fetish sculptures and other works from non-European cultures were taken up by Picasso, [[Henri Matisse]], and many of their colleagues. Later in the 20th century, [[Pop Art]] and [[Abstract Expressionism]] came to prominence.

===Late 20th and early 21st centuries===

Rapid advances in science and technology led to the late Modern and [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] period. In these periods, the art and cultures of the world went through many changes, and there was a great deal of intermixture between cultures, as new [[mass media|communications technologies]] facilitated the national and even global dissemination of music, art and style. The separation of regional cultures that had marked the 19th century was replaced by a global culture. Postmodernism describes a broad movement that developed in the mid- to late-20th century across philosophy, the arts, architecture, and criticism which marked a departure from modernism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/postmodernism |title=Postmodernism |work=[[Oxford Dictionaries]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |first=Ruth |last=Reichl |author-link=Ruth Reichl |date=1989 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html |dictionary=[[American Heritage Dictionary]] |title=postmodern |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209075319/http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html |archive-date=9 December 2008 |access-date=29 September 2018 |edition=4th |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=The Symbolic Function of Transmodernity |journal=Language and Psychoanalysis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=68–87 |url=https://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |doi=10.7565/landp.2012.0005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008211951/http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |archive-date=8 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association of Research Institutes in the History of Art''' (RIHA) promotes education and research in [[art history]] and related disciplines. It was founded in 1998 in [[Paris]] to intensify cooperation between art historical institutes by facilitating the flow of information on scientific and administrative activities as well as the exchange of research findings, and to encourage the institutes to undertake joint projects.

The '''RIHA Journal''' is a peer-reviewed, open-access e-journal providing a publishing platform for international research articles in the history of art. It features art historical articles in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.

==Questions of foreplay and oral sex==
There are differences of opinion in this topic. Many scholars believe that oral sex is permissible, but it is disliked. The group of scholars who view oral-genital contact as permissible is mostly because there is no clear command in [[Hadith]] and [[Qur'an]] prohibiting such act. Prominent Muslim scholars like [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] share this view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/family/intimate-relations/174682-islams-stance-on-oral-sex.html Yusuf's view]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there is no mentioning of such act as a part of foreplay in Hadith although Islam stresses on the importance of foreplay, as kissing, touching and the like are explicitly mentioned in Hadith.&lt;ref name="kiss"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kissing and Foreplay|url=http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/kissf.htm|work=Darul Iftaa|publisher=Central-Mosque.com|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Muhammad ibn Adam al-Kawthari|date=14 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual intercourse has to be avoided unless foreplay takes place according to [[Sunnah]].&lt;ref name="foreplay 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic bedroom fiqh|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-basic-fiqh.html|work=Hanafi fiqh|publisher=The Modern Religion|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Sidi Faraz Rabbani}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad]] forbade acting like an animal with one's wife which indicates sexual intercourse without foreplay.&lt;ref name="kiss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kiss 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kissing and Foreplay in Islam|url=http://www.zawaj.com/articles/kissing-and-foreplay.html|work=Sex in Islam|publisher=Zawaj.com|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Muhammad ibn Adam al-Kawthari}}&lt;/ref&gt; The husband is also responsible for satisfying the wife's need (i.e. bringing her to an orgasm) as part of a healthy marriage and to ensure the right of the wife.&lt;ref name="kiss 2" /&gt; During foreplay and intercourse, the husband is allowed to take pleasure from the wife's breast, in Hanafi school of thought it is permissible as long as no secretion (i.e. milk) is consumed during this act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drinking one's wife's milk, during foreplay or intercourse|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-wifes-milk.html|work=Hanafi fiqh list|publisher=The Modern Religion|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Sidi Faraz Rabbani}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of the scholars, including from Hanbali, Shafi and Malaki school of thought have agreed that accidentally consuming breast milk will not affect the relationship between husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/2864|title=What is the ruling on drinking one’s wife’s milk? - islamqa.info|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=84646|title=Husband drinking milk from his wifes breast|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is permissible in Islam for the husband and wife to touch their private parts in order to arouse each other.&lt;ref name="foreplay 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="qna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex_qna.html|title=Sexual Relations Between Husband &amp; Wife|first=|last=FAREENA|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mututal {{sic|hide=y|nolink=y|reason=spelling error in source|mututal}} masturbation between spouses|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-mutual-masturbation.html|work=Hanafi fiqh list|publisher=The Modern Religion|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Sidi Faraz Rabbani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions on married life|url=http://fiqhanswers.blogspot.com/2007/10/questions-on-married-life.html|work=Fiqh Q&amp;A|publisher=Hanafi Fiqh|accessdate=8 July 2012|date=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Etiquettes of Marriage|url=http://islamworld.net/resources/326|work=IslamWorld|publisher=Islam World/marriage.html|accessdate=8 July 2012|date=4 October 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618122115/http://islamworld.net/resources/326|archivedate=18 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On touching the penis===
There are commentaries on touching the male genital by oneself in various narrations of Hadith. One example is the hadith of Basrah bint Safwaan, who heard Muhammad say: "Whoever touches his private parts, let him do [[Wudu|wudoo]] (washing)’." (Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Tahaarah, 154. al-Albaani said in Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood, no. 166, it is saheeh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing one’s clothes does not break wudoo’|url=http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/14321|work=Islam Q and A|publisher=[[IslamQA]]|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Hanafi]] [[jurist]]s claim touching the penis in [[Sharia|Islamic Law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Touching the Penis in Islamic Law|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/429229?uid=3739136&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=47699122405497|work=Chicago Journal|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|accessdate=8 July 2012|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not a [[shame]]ful act. The [[Sahih]] Hadith of ''al-Muwatta'' [[Muhammad al-Shaybani|Imam Muhammad]] argues that "The act is not impure". He emphasizes that "If the penis were vile or impure, it should be cut off from the body and thrown away". The Hadith claims that there is no difference between the penis and the other parts of body. However, there are also Sahih Hadith&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://seekerselite.com/wudu-touching-private-parts/|title=Wudu After touching the Private Parts - Seekers Elite|work=Seekers Elite|access-date=2017-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which mentions the performing of [[Ritual purification|ablution]] is compulsory after the touching of the sexual organ.
The first and second of these reports are related to the oft-cited report, given on the authority of Talq b. ؛Ali [b. al-Mundhir b. Qays], concerning the saying of Muhammad about the penis. Talq b. ؛Ali said: "We were with the Apostle of God when a man, like a [[Bedouin]], came to him and said: "Oh Apostle of God, what do you think about a man touching his penis after performing [[wudu]]?" Muhammad said: "What is it but a piece of your flesh?". {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} There is some disagreement about this report and as noted above, the strongest evidence for making ablution after touching one's penis comes from Basrah bint Safwaan's account of Muhammad saying "Whoever touches his genitals, let him do wudoo’."
It is also reported that Muhammad said:

# "Whenever anyone of you makes water (urinates) he should not hold his penis or clean his private parts with his right hand." ([[Sahih Bukhari]], 1.4.156)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/004.sbt.html Translation of Sahih Bukhari] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525070903/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/004.sbt.html |date=2011-05-25 }} Book 4: Ablutions (Wudu')&lt;/ref&gt;
# "When anyone amongst you enters the privy he should not touch his penis with his right hand." ([[Sahih Muslim]], 2.0512)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/muslim/002.smt.html Translation of Sahih Muslim] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513235949/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/muslim/002.smt.html |date=2011-05-13 }} Book 2: The Book of Purification (Kitab Al-Taharah&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to sexual gratification==

===Alternative views: Oral sex as foreplay===
Oral sex (oral-genital contact) is considered as a part of foreplay by those who allow it, not as an alternative to vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref name="qna"/&gt; One group of [[Salafi]] scholars and [[Shafi`i]] school says that oral sex is ''halal'' (permissible) because of the [[hadith]] in which he encouraged [[foreplay]] between spouses, and that these are naturally gratifying activities that will help them have a better marriage.

Dr. [[Heba Kotb]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Dr. Heba Kotb|url=http://www.hebakotb.net/en/About|work=Dr.Heba Kotb|publisher=Dr.Heba Kotb|accessdate=8 July 2012|language=Arabic, English|date=20 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717080351/http://www.hebakotb.net/en/About|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Sunni female scholar{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} who gives sex advice on [[Egypt]]ian TV, said that oral sex is allowed "since there is no religious text banning it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muslim Woman Gives Sex Advice on Arab TV|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/16710/muslim-woman-gives-sex-advice-on-arab-tv|work=SFGate.com, USA|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Nadia Abou El-Magd|date=3 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She considers oral sex as a part of foreplay on this ground that Islam "stresses the importance of foreplay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Revolution in Islam?|url=http://steelturman.typepad.com/thesteeldeal/2006/12/sexual_revoluti.html|work=The Steel's Brain|publisher=The Steel's Brain|accessdate=9 July 2012|date=12 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avoiding secretions===
Schools of thought ([[Madh'hab]]) such as [[Shafi'i]] and [[Hanbali]] consider fellatio as permissible but only as part of foreplay while all [[Madh'hab|schools]] regard genital secretion as [[Ritual purity in Islam|impure]]. Oral sex is permitted provided that secretion from the genitalia is not consumed and no injury or infliction made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions On Sexuality|url=http://www.livingislam.org/fiqhi/fiqha_e92.html|work=living ISLAM – Islamic Tradition|publisher=www.livingislam.org|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumption of semen on the other hand is believed to be not permissible by some scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askthescholar.com/question-details.aspx?qstID=684|title=Ask The Scholar|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicity.com/qa/action.lasso.asp?-db=services&amp;-lay=Ask&amp;-op=eq&amp;number=43425&amp;-format=detailpop.shtml&amp;-find|title=IslamiCity.com - Q &amp; A|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the stronger view is that it is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=89730|title=Swallowing semen|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple has to rinse their mouth afterwards to maintain cleanliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is oral sex permitted?|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-oral.html|work=Hanbali Fiqh list|publisher=The Modern Religion|accessdate=9 July 2012|author=Sidi Musa Furber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bathing (ghusl) after oral sex===
According to alternative views, oral sex is only permitted as a way of stimulation and foreplay. If a husband does have oral sex with his wife, and ejaculates semen, then [[ghusl]] is obligatory according to [[Islamic sexual hygienical jurisprudence]]; however, if he only releases Madhy ([[Pre-ejaculate|pre-ejaculatory fluids]]) then Wudu is only required, and has to wash the Madhy away.

'''Kurt Nikolai Zoege von Manteuffel''' (8 August 1881 – 10 January 1941) was a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] [[art history|art historian]].

Kurt Zoege von Manteuffel was born in present-day [[Tallinn]], Estonia (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]) and spent his childhood in Estonia. His father belonged to the [[Baltic nobility]] and his mother was Danish. He studied in [[Kassel]] and [[Königsberg]] and at the universities in [[Munich]], [[University of Halle|Halle]] and [[Berlin]]. In 1909 he earned his doctoral degree; his dissertation was about [[Pisanello]]. He worked 1909-10 at the [[Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum]] in [[Aachen]] and the following three years as a member of the editorial board of an art encyclopaedia. Later he worked at the [[Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz]], but volunteered to fight in [[World War I]] and was severely wounded in 1918. The following year he took up work in [[Dresden]] and in 1924 he became director of the [[Kupferstich-Kabinett, Dresden|Kupferstich-Kabinett]] there. He died in 1941 in [[Chojnice]].&lt;ref name="BBL"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://bbld.de/0000000110230254/query/Manteuffel-Kurt-Nikolai/|title= Zoege v.

Also available as an electronic source.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Library and Information Sciences is the name used in the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] for class 20 from the 18th edition (1971) to the 22nd edition (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; or as "'''library and information studies'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Library School University Programs|url=http://www.canadian-universities.net/Universities/Programs/Library_School.html|website=www.canadian-universities.net|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a merging of [[library science]] and [[information science]]. The joint term is associated with schools of library and information science (abbreviated to "SLIS"). In the last part of the 1960s, [[library school|schools of librarianship]], which generally developed from professional training programs (not academic disciplines) to university institutions during the second half of the 20th century, began to add the term "information science" to their names. The first school to do this was at the University of Pittsburgh in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, T. J. (1977). Pittsburgh. University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Library and Information Sciences. IN: Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science (Vol. 22). Ed. by A. Kent, H. Lancour &amp; J.E.Daily. New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc. (pp. 280–291)&lt;/ref&gt; More schools followed during the 1970s and 1980s, and by the 1990s almost all library schools in the USA had added information science to their names.
Weaver Press:
Although there are exceptions, similar developments have taken place in other parts of the world. In Denmark, for example, the 'Royal School of Librarianship' changed its English name to [[The Royal School of Library and Information Science]] in 1997. Exceptions include Tromsø, Norway, where the term [[documentation science]] is the preferred name of the field, France, where information science and communication studies form one [[interdiscipline]],&lt;ref&gt;Mucchielli, A., (2000), La nouvelle communication : épistémologie des sciences de l’informationcommunication. Paris, Armand Colin, 2000. Collection U. Sciences de la communication&lt;/ref&gt; and Sweden, where the fields of [[Archival science]], [[Library science]] and [[Museology]] have been integrated as Archival, Library and Museum studies.

In spite of various trends to merge the two fields, some consider the two original disciplines, [[library science]] and [[information science]], to be separate.&lt;ref name="Saracevic"&gt;Saracevic, Tefko (1992). Information science: origin, evolution and relations. In: ''Conceptions of library and information science. Historical, empirical and theoretical perspectives''. Edited by Pertti Vakkari &amp; Blaise Cronin. London: Taylor Graham (pp. 5-27).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miksa, Francis L. (1992). Library and information science: two paradigms. In: ''Conceptions of library and information science. Historical, empirical and theoretical perspectives''. Edited by Pertti Vakkari &amp; Blaise Cronin. London: Taylor Graham  (pp. 229-252).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tendency today is to use the terms as [[synonym]]s or to drop the term "library" and to speak about ''information departments'' or ''[[I-school]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Educating a new generation of library and information science professionals: A
United States perspective|url=https://digitalcommons.du.edu/lis_facpub|journal=Digital Commons @ DU|volume=82|issue=2|pages=189-206|doi=|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been attempts to revive the concept of [[documentation]] and to speak of [[Library, information and documentation]] studies (or science).&lt;ref&gt;Rayward, W. B. (Ed.) (2004). Aware and responsible. Papers of the Nordic- International Colloquium on Social and Cultural Awareness and responsibility in Library, Information, and Documentation Studies (SCARLID). Lanham, MD:&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations between library science, information science and LIS==
Tefko Saracevic (1992, p.&amp;nbsp;13)&lt;ref name="Saracevic"/&gt; argued that library science and information science are separate fields:

{{quote|The common ground between library science and information science, which is a strong one, is in the sharing of their social role and in their general concern with the problems of effective utilization of graphic records. But there are also very significant differences in several critical respects, among them in: (1) selection of problems addressed and in the way they were defined; (2) theoretical questions asked and frameworks established;(3) the nature and degree of experimentation and empirical development and the resulting practical knowledge/competencies derived; (4) tools and approaches used; and (5) the nature and strength of interdisciplinary relations established and the dependence of the progress and evolution of interdisciplinary approaches. All of these differences warrant the conclusion that librarianship and information science are two different fields in a strong interdisciplinary relation, rather than one and the same field, or one being a special case of the other.}}

Another indication of the different uses of the two terms are the indexing in UMI's [[Dissertations Abstracts]]. In ''Dissertations Abstracts Online'' on November 2011 were 4888 dissertations indexed with the descriptor LIBRARY SCIENCE and 9053 with the descriptor INFORMATION SCIENCE. For the year 2009 the numbers were 104 LIBRARY SCIENCE and 514 INFORMATION SCIENCE. 891 dissertations were indexed with both terms (36 in 2009).

It should be considered that information science grew out of [[documentation science]] and therefore has a tradition for considering scientific and scholarly communication, [[bibliographic database]]s, subject knowledge and terminology etc. Library science, on the other hand has mostly concentrated on libraries and their internal processes and best practices. It is also relevant to consider that information science used to be done by scientists, while librarianship has been split between public libraries and scholarly research libraries. [[Library school]]s have mainly educated librarians for public libraries and not shown much interest in scientific communication and documentation. When information scientists from 1964 entered library schools, they brought with them competencies in relation to information retrieval in subject databases, including concepts such as recall and precision, boolean search techniques, query formulation and related issues. Subject bibliographic databases and citation indexes provided a major step forward in information dissemination - and also in the curriculum at library schools.

Julian Warner (2010)&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;Warner, Julian (2010). ''Human information retrieval.''Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the information and computer science tradition in [[information retrieval]] may broadly be characterized as '''query transformation''', with the query articulated verbally by the user in advance of searching and then transformed by a system into a set of records. From librarianship and indexing, on the other hand, has been an implicit stress on '''selection power''' enabling the user to make relevant selections.

==Difficulties defining LIS==
"The question, 'What is library and information science?' does not elicit responses of the same internal conceptual coherence as similar inquiries as to the nature of other fields, e.g., 'What is chemistry?', 'What is economics?', 'What is medicine?' Each of those fields, though broad in scope, has clear ties to basic concerns of their field. [...] Neither LIS theory nor practice is perceived to be monolithic nor unified by a common literature or set of professional skills. Occasionally, LIS scholars (many of whom do not self-identify as members of an interreading LIS community, or prefer names other than LIS), attempt, but are unable, to find core concepts in common. Some believe that computing and internetworking concepts and skills underlie virtually every important aspect of LIS, indeed see LIS as a sub-field of computer science! [Footnote III.1] Others claim that LIS is principally a social science accompanied by practical skills such as ethnography and interviewing. Historically, traditions of public service, bibliography, documentalism, and information science have viewed their mission, their philosophical toolsets, and their domain of research differently. Still others deny the existence of a greater metropolitan LIS, viewing LIS instead as a loosely organized collection of specialized interests often unified by nothing more than their shared (and fought-over) use of the descriptor information. Indeed, claims occasionally arise to the effect that the field even has no theory of its own." (Konrad, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;652-653).

=== A multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary or monodisciplinary field? ===
The Swedish researcher Emin Tengström (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Tengström, E. (1993). Biblioteks- och informationsvetenskapen - ett fler- eller tvär-vetenskapligt område? Svensk Biblioteksforskning,(1), 9-20.&lt;/ref&gt; described [[cross-disciplinary]] research as a process, not a state or structure. He differentiates three levels of ambition regarding cross-disciplinary research:
* The "[[Pluridisciplinary]]" or "[[multidisciplinarity]]" level
* The genuine cross-disciplinary level: "[[interdisciplinarity]]"
* The discipline-forming level "[[transdisciplinarity]]"

What is described here is a view of social fields as dynamic and changing. Library and information science is viewed as a field that started as a multidisciplinary field based on literature, psychology, sociology, management, computer science etc., which is developing towards an [[academic discipline]] in its own right. However, the following quote seems to indicate that LIS is actually developing in the opposite direction:

Chua &amp; Yang (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Chua, A.  &amp; Yang, C.C. (2008). The shift towards multi-disciplinarity in information science, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 59(13), 2156–2170.&lt;/ref&gt; studied papers published in ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'' in the period 1988-1997 and found, among other things: "Top authors have grown in diversity from those being affiliated predominantly with library/information-related departments to include those from information systems management, information technology, business, and the humanities. Amid heterogeneous clusters of collaboration among top authors, strongly connected crossdisciplinary
coauthor pairs have become more prevalent. Correspondingly, the distribution of top keywords’ occurrences that leans heavily on core information science has shifted towards other subdisciplines such as information technology and sociobehavioral science."

A more recent study revealed that 31% of the papers published in 31 LIS journals from 2007 through 2012 were by authors in academic departments of library and information science (i.e., those offering degree programs accredited by the [[American Library Association]] or similar professional organizations in other countries).  Faculty in departments of [[computer science]] (10%), [[management]] (10%), [[communication]] (3%), the other social sciences (9%), and the other natural sciences (7%) were also represented.  Nearly one-quarter of the papers in the 31 journals were by practicing librarians, and 6% were by others in non-academic (e.g., corporate) positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walters|first=William H.|last2=Wilder|first2=Esther Isabelle|date=2016|title=Disciplinary, national, and departmental contributions to the literature of library and information science, 2007-2012|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23448|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|language=en|volume=67|issue=6|pages=1487–1506|doi=10.1002/asi.23448|issn=2330-1635|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a field with its own body of interrelated concepts, techniques, journals, and professional associations, LIS is clearly a discipline. But by the nature of its subject matter and methods LIS is just as clearly an [[interdiscipline]], drawing on many adjacent fields (see below).

=== A fragmented adhocracy ===
Richard Whitley (1984,&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, R. (1984). The fragmented state of management studies: Reasons and consequences. Journal of management studies, 21(3), 331-348.&lt;/ref&gt; 2000)&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, R. (2000). The intellectual and social organization of the sciences.
Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; classified scientific fields according to their intellectual and social organization and described management studies as a ‘fragmented adhocracy’, a field with a low level of coordination around a diffuse set of goals and a non-specialized terminology; but with strong connections to the practice in the business sector. Åström (2006)&lt;ref name="Astrom"&gt;Åström, F. (2006). The social and intellectual development of library and information science. Doctoral theses at the Department of Sociology, Umeå University,. No 48 2006. http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:145144/FULLTEXT01&lt;/ref&gt; applied this conception to the description of LIS.

=== Scattering of the literature ===
Meho &amp; Spurgin (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Meho, Lokman I. &amp; Spurgin, Kristina M. (2005). Ranking the Research Productivity of Library and Information Science Faculty and Schools: An Evaluation of Data Sources and Research Methods. ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'', 56(12), 1314–1331.&lt;/ref&gt; found that in a list of 2,625 items published between 1982 and 2002 by 68 faculty members of 18 schools of library and information science, only 10 databases provided significant coverage of the LIS literature. Results also show that restricting the data sources to one, two, or even three databases leads to inaccurate rankings and erroneous conclusions. Because no database provides comprehensive coverage of the LIS literature, researchers must rely on a wide range of disciplinary and multidisciplinary databases for ranking and other research purposes. Even when the nine most comprehensive databases in LIS was searched and combined, 27.0% (or 710 of 2,635) of the publications remain not found.
{{quote|The study confirms earlier research that LIS literature is highly scattered and is not limited to standard LIS databases. What was not known or verified before, however, is that a significant amount of this literature is indexed in the interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary databases of Inside Conferences and INSPEC. Other interdisciplinary databases, such as America: History and Life, were also found to be very useful and complementary to traditional LIS databases, particularly in the areas of archives and library history. (Meho &amp; Spurgin, 2005, p.1329).}}

==The unique concern of library and information science==
"Concern for people becoming informed is not unique to LIS, and thus is insufficient to differentiate LIS from other fields. LIS are a part of a larger enterprise." (Konrad, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;655).&lt;ref&gt;Konrad, A. (2007). On inquiry: Human concept formation and construction of meaning through library and information science intermediation (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). University of California, Berkeley. Retrieved from http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1s76b6hp&lt;/ref&gt;

"The unique concern of LIS is recognized as: Statement of the core concern of LIS:
'''Humans becoming informed (constructing meaning) via intermediation between inquirers and instrumented records'''. No other field has this as its concern. " (Konrad, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;660)

"Note that the promiscuous term ''information'' does not appear in the above statement circumscribing the field's central concerns: The detrimental effects of the ambiguity this term provokes are discussed above (Part III). Furner [Furner 2004, 427] has shown that discourse in the field is improved where specific terms are utilized in place of the i-word for specific senses of that term." (Konrad, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;661).

Michael Buckland wrote: "Educational programs in library, information and documentation are concerned with what people know, are not limited to technology, and require wide-ranging expertise. They differ fundamentally and importantly from computer science programs and from the information systems programs found in business schools.".&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael K. (2004). Reflections on social and cultural awareness and responsibility in library, information and documentation - Commentary on the SCARLID colloquium. In: Rayward, W. B. (Ed.). ''Aware and responsible. Papers of the Nordic- International Colloquium on Social and Cultural Awareness and responsibility in Library, Information, and Documentation Studies (SCARLID)''. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. (pp. 169-175).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bawden and Robinson argue that while Information Science has overlaps with numerous other disciplines with interest in studying communication, it is unique in that it is concerned with all aspects of the communication chain.&lt;ref name = "Bawden"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bawden|first1=David|last2=Robinson|first2=Lyn|title=Introduction to information science|date=2013|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers, Incorporated|location=Chicago|isbn=9781555708610}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6,8}}  For example Computer Science may be interested in the indexing and retrieval, sociology with user studies, and publishing (business) with dissemination, whereas information science is interested in the study of all of these individual areas and the interactions between them.&lt;ref name="Bawden"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

The organization of information and information resources is one of the fundamental aspects of LIS. &lt;ref name="Bawden"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|106}} and is an example of both LIS's uniqueness and its multidisciplinary origins.  Some of the main tools used by LIS toward this end to provide access to the digital resources of modern times (particularly theory relating to indexing and classification) originated in 19th century to assist humanity's effort to make its intellectual output accessible by recording, identifying, and providing bibliographic control of printed knowledge.  &lt;ref name="Bawden"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}}.  The origin for some of these tools were even earlier. For example, in the 17th century, during the [[History_of_libraries#Enlightenment_era_libraries|'golden age of libraries']], publishers and sellers seeking to take advantage of the burgeoning book trade developed descriptive catalogs of their wares for distribution – a practice was adopted and further extrapolated by many libraries of the time to cover areas like philosophy, sciences, linguistics, medicine, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=Library : an illustrated history.|date=2012|publisher=W W Norton|location=New York|isbn=9781616084530}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|120}}  In this way, a business concern of publishers – keeping track of and advertising inventory – was developed into a system for organizing and preserving information by the library.

The development of [[Metadata]] is another area that exemplifies the aim of LIS to be something more than an mishmash of several disciplines – that uniqueness Bawden and Robinson describe.  Pre-Internet classification systems and [[Cataloging|cataloging]] systems were mainly concerned with two objectives: 1. to provide rich bibliographic descriptions and relations between information objects and 2. to facilitate sharing of this bibliographic information across library boundaries.&lt;ref name = "Qin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeng|first1=Marcia Lei|last2=Qin|first2=Jian|title=Metadata.|date=2014|publisher=Neal-Schuman|location=New York|isbn=978-1-55570-965-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{rp|14}}  The development of the Internet and the information explosion that followed found many communities needing mechanisms for the description, authentication and management of their information. &lt;ref name = "Qin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}  These communities developed taxonomies and controlled vocabularies to describe their knowledge as well as unique information architectures to communicate these classifications and libraries found themselves as liaison or translator between these metadata systems.  &lt;ref name = "Qin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15-16}}  Of course the concerns of cataloging in the Internet era have gone beyond simple bibliographic descriptions.  The need for descriptive information about the ownership and copyright of a digital product – a publishing concern – and description for the different formats and accessibility features of a resource – a sociological concern – show the continued development and cross discipline necessity of resource description.&lt;ref name = "Qin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}

==LIS theories==
Julian Warner (2010, p.&amp;nbsp;4-5)&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt; suggests that

{{quote|Two paradigms, the cognitive and the physical, have been distinguished in information retrieval research, but they share the assumption of the value of delivering relevant records (Ellis 1984, 19;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, David (1984). Theory and explanation in information retrieval research. ''Journal of Information Science'', 8, 25-38&lt;/ref&gt; Belkin and Vickery 1985, 114&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, N. J. &amp; Vickery, A. (1985)- ''Interaction in information systems: A review of research from document retrieval to knowledge-based systems.'' London: British Library (Library and Information Research Report 35).&lt;/ref&gt;). For the purpose of discussion here, they can be considered a single heterogeneous paradigm, linked but not united by this common assumption. The value placed on query transformation is dissonant with common practice, where users may prefer to explore an area and may value fully informed exploration. Some dissenting research discussions have been more congruent with practice, advocating explorative capability - the ability to explore and make discriminations between representations of objects - as the fundamental design principle for information retrieval systems.}}

The domain analytic approach (e.g., Hjørland 2010&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger (2010). The foundation of the concept of relevance. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology. 61(2), 217-237.&lt;/ref&gt;) suggests that the relevant criteria for making discriminations in information retrieval are scientific and scholarly criteria. In some fields (e.g. evidence-based medicine)&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger (2011). Evidence based practice: An analysis based on the philosophy of science. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 62(7), 1301-1310.&lt;/ref&gt; the relevant distinctions are very explicit. In other cases they are implicit or unclear. At the basic level, the relevance of bibliographical records are determined by epistemological criteria of what constitutes knowledge.

Among other approaches, [[Evidence Based Library and Information Practice]] should also be mentioned.

==Common subfields==
{{Information science}}
An advertisement for a full Professor in information science at the Royal School of Library and Information Science, spring 2011, provides one view of which subdisciplines are well-established:&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement for a full Professor in information science at the Royal School of Library and Information Science, spring 2011: {{cite web|url=http://www.job-i-staten.dk/SearchResults/position-as-full-professor-in-information-science-lja-3723916.aspx?jobId%3DLJA-3723916%26list%3DSearchResultsJobsIds%26index%3D6%26querydesc%3DSearchJobQueryDescription%26viewedfrom%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425131559/http://www.job-i-staten.dk/SearchResults/position-as-full-professor-in-information-science-lja-3723916.aspx?jobId=LJA-3723916&amp;list=SearchResultsJobsIds&amp;index=6&amp;querydesc=SearchJobQueryDescription&amp;viewedfrom=1 |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The research and teaching/supervision must be within some (and at least one) of these well-established information science areas

* h.	[[Digital literacy]] (cf [[information literacy]])
* i.	[[Bibliometrics]] or [[scientometrics]]
* j.	[[Interaction design]] and [[user experience]]"
* k.   [[Digital library]]

There are other ways to identify subfields within LIS, for example bibliometric mapping and comparative studies of curricula.
Bibliometric maps of LIS have been produced by, among others, Vickery &amp; Vickery (1987, frontispiece),&lt;ref&gt;Vickery, Brian &amp; Vickery, Alina (1987). ''Information science in theory and practice. London: Bowker-Saur.&lt;/ref&gt; White &amp; McCain (1998),&lt;ref&gt;White, H. D., &amp; McCain, K. W. (1998). Visualizing a discipline: An author co-citation analysis of information science, 1972-1995. Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 49(4), 327-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Åström (2002,&lt;ref&gt;Åström, Fredrik (2002) Visualizing Library and Information Science concept spaces through keyword and citation based maps and clusters. In: Bruce, Fidel, Ingwersen &amp; Vakkari (Eds.). Emerging frameworks and methods: Proceedings of the fourth international conference on conceptions of Library and Information Science (CoLIS4), pp 185-197. Greenwood Village: Libraries unlimited.&lt;/ref&gt; 2006) and Hassan-Montero &amp; Herrero-Solana (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Hassan-Montero, Y., Herrero-Soalana, V. (2007). Visualizing Library and Information Science from the practitioner's perspective. 11th International Conference of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics
June 25–27, 2007, Madrid (Spain). http://yusef.es/Visualizing_LIS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
An example of a curriculum study is Kajberg &amp; Lørring, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Kajberg, Leif &amp; Lørring, Leif (eds.). (2005). ''European Curriculum Reflections on Library and Information Science Education.'' Copenhagen: The Royal School of Library and Information Science. http://library.upt.ro/LIS_Bologna.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In this publication are the following data reported (p 234):
"Degree of overlap of the ten curricular themes with subject areas in the current curricula of responding LIS schools
* [[Information seeking]] and [[Information retrieval]] 100%
* [[Library management]] and promotion 96%
* [[Knowledge management]] 86%
* [[Knowledge organization]] 82%
* [[Information literacy]] and learning 76%
* Library and society in a historical perspective ([[Library history]]) 66%
*  The [[Information society]]: Barriers to the [[free access to information]] 64%
* [[Cultural heritage]] and digitisation of the cultural heritage ([[Digital preservation]]) 62%
* The library in the multi-cultural information society: International and intercultural communication 42%
* Mediation of culture in a special European context 26% "

There is often an overlap between these subfields of LIS and other fields of study. Most information retrieval research, for example, belongs to computer science. Knowledge management is considered a subfield of management or organizational studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Knowledge Management|editor1-last=Clegg|editor1-first=Stewart|editor2-last=Bailey|editor2-first=James R.|title=International Encyclopedia of Organizational Studies|date=2008|publisher=Sage Publications Inc.|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|isbn=978-1-4129-5390-0|pages=758-762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This incomplete '''list of art critics''' enumerates persons who had or have a significant part of their known creative output in the form of [[art criticism]], which consists mostly of the written discussion and aesthetic evaluation of [[Work of art|works of art]].&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;
{{Compact ToC|seealso=yes|q=}}

==Scope==
{{main|Art critic}}
There is no official list of [[art critic]]s, the compilation of which is compounded by problems in defining [[art criticism]] – not least of which is the overlap with [[art history]],&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; and [[Aesthetics|philosophy of art]]. Herein will be included those [[authors]] that are mentioned as being art critics or producing art criticism in works of reference, as are encyclopedias, dictionaries or scholarly reviews.

According to one authority, art criticism, in a close approximation to the current sociocultural framework of the activity, started in the [[18th century CE]] in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; However, many authors living before that time and outside that region of the world wrote on the subject of art and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic experience]], though using [[Philosophy of art|terms and concepts]] that may not have a direct translation into the lexicon of the [[Western culture|Western]] tradition.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; These, when mentioned, will be included as well though pertinently noted.

[[Image:oceanic spreading.svg|thumb|250px|right|Oceanic crust is formed at an oceanic ridge, while the lithosphere is subducted back into the asthenosphere at trenches.]]

'''Marine geology''' or '''geological oceanography''' is the study of the history and structure of the ocean floor. It involves [[geophysical]], [[geochemistry|geochemical]], [[sedimentology|sedimentological]] and [[paleontological]] investigations of the [[ocean floor]] and [[coastal zone]]. Marine geology has strong ties to [[geophysics]] and to [[physical oceanography]].

Marine geological studies were of extreme importance in providing the critical evidence for [[sea floor spreading]] and [[plate tectonics]] in the years following World War II. The deep ocean floor is the last essentially unexplored frontier and detailed mapping in support of both military (submarine) objectives and economic ([[petroleum]] and [[metal]] [[mining]]) objectives drives the research.

==Overview==
[[Image:Marianatrenchmap.png|thumb|left|A trench forms at the boundary where two tectonic plates meet]]

The [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]] around the [[Pacific Ocean]] with its attendant intense [[volcanism]] and [[seismic]] activity poses a major threat for disastrous [[earthquake]]s, [[tsunami]]s and volcanic eruptions. Any ''early warning'' systems for these disastrous events will require a more detailed understanding of marine geology of coastal and [[island arc]] environments.

The study of [[littoral]] and deep sea sedimentation and the precipitation and dissolution rates of [[calcium carbonate]] in various marine environments has important implications for global [[climate change]].

The discovery and continued study of [[Mid-oceanic ridge|mid-ocean rift]] zone volcanism and [[hydrothermal vent]]s, first in the [[Red Sea]] and later along the [[East Pacific Rise]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] systems were and continue to be important areas of marine geological research. The [[extremophile]] organisms discovered living within and adjacent to those hydrothermal systems have had a pronounced impact on our understanding of life on Earth and potentially the [[origin of life]] within such an environment.

[[Oceanic trench]]es are hemispheric-scale long but narrow topographic depressions of the sea floor. They also are the deepest parts of the ocean floor.

The [[Mariana Trench]] (or Marianas Trench) is the deepest known submarine trench, and the deepest location in the Earth's crust itself. A [[subduction zone]] where the [[Pacific Plate]] is being subducted under the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. The bottom of the trench is further below sea level than [[Mount Everest]] is above sea level.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Physics''' (MPP) is a [[physics]] institute in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] that specializes in [[high energy physics]] and [[astroparticle physics]]. It is part of the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft]] and is also known as the [[Werner Heisenberg]] Institute, after its first director in its current location.

The founding of the institute traces back to 1914, as an idea from [[Fritz Haber]], [[Walther Nernst]], [[Max Planck]], [[Emil Warburg]], [[Heinrich Rubens]]. On October 1, 1917, the institute was officially founded in Berlin as ''[[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics|Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik]]'' (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics) with [[Albert Einstein]] as the first head director.&lt;ref name=MPIP-history&gt;"[https://www.mpp.mpg.de/institut/Geschichte/01_Ubersicht/index.html Geschichte]" (in German). Max Planck Institute for Physics. Abbreviated version in English: "[https://www.mpp.mpg.de/english/institute/instGeschichte/Overview/index.html History]." Retrieved  2015-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1922, [[Max von Laue]] succeeded Einstein as managing director. Einstein gave up his position as a director of the institute in April 1933.&lt;ref name=MPIP-history/&gt; The Institute took part in the [[German nuclear weapon project]] from 1939-1942.&lt;ref name=MPIP-history/&gt; 

A year after the end of fighting in Europe in World War II, the institute was moved to [[Göttingen]] and renamed the Max Planck Institute for Physics, with Heisenberg continuing as managing director. In 1946, [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] and [[Karl Wirtz]] joined the faculty as the directors for theoretical and experimental physics, respectively.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In June 1942, [[Werner Heisenberg]] took over as managing director.&lt;ref name=MPIP-history/&gt; In 1955 the institute made the decision to move to Munich, and soon after began construction of its current building, designed by [[Sep Ruf]]. The institute moved into its current location on September 1, 1958 and took on the new name the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics, still with Heisenberg as the managing director. In 1991, the institute was split into the Max Planck Institute for Physics, the [[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]] and the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]].

[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is considered to be one of the most notorious metal pollutants present in food, water, air and soil, but the process of eliminating it is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Li B, Zhang Y, Ma D, Shi Z, Ma S. Mercury Nano-Trap for Effective and Efficient Removal of Mercury (II) from Aqueous Solution. Nature Communications 2014 November 20; 5(5537): 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy metals such as mercury are formed on the earth's crust and made into solutions with ground water through certain natural processing and pH changes occurring in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Ralston N. Nanomaterials: Nano-selenium captures mercury. Nature Nanotechnology 2008 09;3(9):527–528.&lt;/ref&gt; There are traditional methods that are used to extract mercury from the natural water sources and industrial waste water, such as [[chemical precipitation]], [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgamation]], [[reverse osmosis]], [[membrane filtration]] and photochemical methods.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker P. Purification at the Nano Scale. The Futurist 2011 Jul;45(4):11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. W. Chang, "Neurotoxic effects of mercury—A review," Environmental Research, vol. 14, no. 3, pp. 329–373, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Q. Wang, D. Kim, D. D. Dionysiou, G. A. Sorial, and D. Timberlake, "Sources and remediation for mercury contamination in aquatic systems—a literature review," Environmental Pollution, vol. 131, no. 2, pp. 323–336, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these methods are expensive, time consuming, and inefficient, hence the need for a nanofiltration technology that overcomes all of these issues.  Nanofiltration technology is very efficient in removal of mercury species due to its characteristics of having high surface area-to-volume and the fact that it's easily chemically functionalized.&lt;ref&gt;Hashim MA, Mukhopadhyay S, Sahu NJ, Sengupta B. Remediation Technologies for Heavy Metal Contaminated Groundwater. Journal of Environmental Management. 2011, June 25; 92(2011): 2355–2388.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Brownian motion of nanomaterials allows them to scan large volume of solvent in short times. There are many copolymer nanoparticles (NPs) that can be used as scavengers to eliminate mercury species via redox reactions such as selenium NPs, manganese dioxide nanowhiskers, carbon nanotube−silverNP composites, silver NPs, silver NP-decorated silicaspheres, gold NP-based materials.  Among these adsorbents, citrate-capped gold NP-based materials have been used intensively to capture mercury species from nature water.

'''Instrumentation'''

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is used to obtain the HRTEM images (FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin working at 200 kV) and double beam UV-visible spectrophotometer is used for the extinction, or removal, of the NPs gold spectra.&lt;ref&gt;Shih YC, Ke CY, Yu CJ, Lu CY, Tseng WL. Combined tween 20-stabilized gold nanoparticles and reduced graphite oxide-Fe3O4 nanoparticle composites for rapid and efficient removal of mercury species from a complex matrix. ACS Applied Mater Interfaces 2014 October 22; 6(20): 17437-17445.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of scanning electron microscope and an energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) for obtaining EDX spectra while sub micrometer particle size analyzer and Delsa nano zeta potential measure the potential of gold NPs. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measures the quantification of mercury species in gold NPs while the linear range of Hg2+ should be between 2.5 and 50 nM. The powder X-ray diffraction is measured using a diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. A superconducting quantum interference device measures the magnetometry while the Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy spectrum is measured by a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer.

'''Removal of mercury species'''
[[File:Mercurynanotrapfigure2.png|thumb|Figure 2: Procedure associated with the removal of Hg2+ by the combination of Tween 20-Au NPs and reduced graphite-Fe3O4 NP composites]]

The application of an external magnetic field helps reduce the Fe3O4 NP compositions and can be used to remove the citrate capped gold NPs or Tween 20- Au NPs. The quantity of the Hg2+ is determined by ICP-MS. Elimination efficiency is calculated as:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;Elimination Efficiency (%) = [(Co – C)/ Co] x 100&lt;/div&gt;

The equilibrium absorption capacity was determined by:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;qe = (Co – Ce) x (V/W)&lt;/div&gt;

where qe is the equilibrium absorption capacity, Ce is the concentration of Hg2+, V is the volume of the solution and W is the weight of Tween 20-Au NPs. Other metals in place of mercury can be used to determine the reusability of the nanofiltration method. A simple nanofiltration process is illustrated in Figure 2.

[[File:Mercurynanotrapfigure3.png|thumb|Figure 3:A highly porous framework such as water is treated with mercury chelating groups, which serve as the "mercury nano trap". These chelating groups hold tightly onto Hg (II) ions, removing it from the water.]]When purifying mercury from sea water, a decrease in the volume to surface area ratio leads to a decline in the efficiency of the elimination.7 Cost efficiency of the nanotrap process is indicated in the fact that the materials can be reused to recycle more water. Tween 20-Au NPs are rapid, efficient and selective in capturing Hg2+ in high salt water concentration when the gold NPs catalyze the citrate ion induced reduction of Hg2+ to Hg0.&lt;ref&gt;F. S. Zhang, J. O. Nriagu, and H. Itoh, "Mercury removal from water using activated carbons derived from organic sewage sludge," Water Research, vol. 39, no. 2–3, pp. 389–395, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; ICP-MS is used to quantify the Hg2+ concentration to determine the level of elimination efficiency. Figure 3 shows an illustration process of the nano trap filtration process.

The use of nanomaterials in removing the mercury from water is advantageous because of the high surface area to volume ratio and the fact that they are easily chemically functionalized. Nanomaterials capture five times more mercury than the maximum mercury captured predicted through the use of previous mercury filtration systems.&lt;ref&gt;Kuriyama M, Haruta K, Dairaku T, Kawamura T, Kikkawa S, Inamoto K, Tsukamoto H, Kondo Y, Torigoe H, Okamoto I, Ono A, Morita EH, Tanaka Y: Hg2+-trapping beads: Hg2+-specific recognition through thymine-Hg(II)-thymine base pairing. Chem Pharm Bull; 2014;62(7):709–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other NP-based methods for Hg2+ removal from high salt matrix, Tween 20-Au NPs is a rapid and selective technique with high efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Ojea-Jiménez, Xicoténcatl López, Jordi Arbiol, and Victor Puntes: Citrate-Coated Gold Nanoparticles As Smart Scavengers for Mercury(II) Removal from Polluted Waters. ACS Nano 2012 6 (3), 2253–60.&lt;/ref&gt; For purification of drinking water, it is advisable to use nano-tablets with the filters because they are easily accessible and cost efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Heidarpour F, Karim WA, Fakhru'l-razi A, Sobri S, Heydarpour V, Zargar M, et al. Complete removal of pathogenic bacteria from drinking water using nano silver-coated cylindrical polypropylene filters. Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy 2011 06;13(3):499–507.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nano-tablet purifies drinking water. Appr Technol 2013 06;40(2):13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moi University''' is a [[public university]] located in Kesses, Uasin Gishu county, in the former Rift Valley Province of [[Kenya]]. It was established in 1984 by the Moi University Act of the [[Parliament of Kenya]], after recommendations from the McKay Commission.

The current chancellor of the university is [[Professor]] [[Miriam Were]] while the vice-chancellor is Professor Isaac Sanga Kosgey.

==History==
Moi University was first established in 1984. In its first year of existence, there was only one department - the Department of Forestry, which had been transferred from the [[University of Nairobi]]. The enrollment that year was 83.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150318000224/https://mu.ac.ke/index.php/bonus-page/typography Vision, Mission and Core Values: Introducing Moi University], Moi University&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's first VC was Professor D. Odhiambo, who served from 1984 to 1988. 

The university's school of medicine was established in 1996, and was the second school of medicine established in [[Kenya|the country]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mu.ac.ke/index.php/bonus-page/schools/113-chs Schools and Colleges: College of Health Sciences], Moi University&lt;/ref&gt;

===MU in the 21st century===
Most of the university's campuses became fully fledged universities in the early 2010s.

The [[Garissa University College attack]] of 2015 happened at the university's Garissa campus and this helped so much in academic accommodation of students who were the victims of the attack and this shows more golden side of understanding power and compassion by the entire moi university fraternity. 

From its founding, the University had no officially recognised mascot. However, in early 2017, students from the School of Engineering chose the [[Nandi Bear]] to be their mascot and, pending consensus from other Schools, the University's mascot. {{fact|date=December 2018}} It was chosen for its legendary status among the [[Nandi people]] (the university was founded in Kesses, which was predominantly settled by the Nandi) and was given a temporary name - "Kerit the Bear".{{fact|date=December 2018}}

==Student life==
===Social===
A nearby shopping centre called "Stage" supplies most of the students' economic needs. There can be found minimarts, nightclubs, convenience stores and other economic activities here. The origin of the name is from the time when the area was a stop for [[matatu|matatus]] that plied the Kesses-Eldoret Town route.

[[File:DSC04629 Istanbul - Sehzade camii - Foto G. Dall'Orto 29-5-2006.jpg|thumb|The later plain type hanging in [[Istanbul]]]]

'''Mosque lamps''' of [[enamelled glass]], often with [[gilding]], survive in considerable numbers from the [[Islamic art]] of the [[Middle Ages]], especially the 13th and 14th centuries, with [[Cairo]] in Egypt and [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] in Syria the most important centres of production.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Mitchell, 134&lt;/ref&gt;  They are [[oil lamp]]s, usually with a large round bulbous body rising to a narrower waist, above which the top section is flared.  There is usually a foot so they can be placed on a surface, but they were normally used suspended by chains that went through a number of loops on the outside of the body.  They were used to light mosques and other buildings in mosque complexes, in large spaces in groups hanging from a circular metal frame.  The circular frames continue to be used in many mosques today, but with plain or frosted glass lamps for electric lighting.

==Manufacture==
The techniques used are typical of contemporary [[Islamic glass]], with the enamel decoration applied to a pre-fired plain body, and the whole then fired for a second time. 
The coloured decoration may include [[Qur'anic]] verses, especially the first part of the ''[[Ayat an-Nur]]'' or "Verse of Light" (24:35, see below), inscriptions and heraldic emblems recording the donor, as well as purely decorative motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Mitchell, 134; [http://www.wallacecollection.org/whatson/treasure/38 A mid-14th-century Islamic glass mosque lamp from Cairo (XXVB94)] [[Wallace Collection]]&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 15th century production of all types of fine glass was in steep decline, a sign of which is that in 1569 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Grand Vizier]] [[Sokullu Mehmed Pacha]] ordered 600 plain lamps of [[Venetian glass]], perhaps to be decorated elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O821/mosque-lamp/ Victoria and Albert Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ottomans]] also made lamps of similar form in [[Iznik pottery]], and [[Shah Abbas I]] of Persia gave plain silver lamps to hang by the tomb of [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili|Shaykh Safi]] at [[Ardabil]]; [[Persian miniature]]s show other examples from the 16th century in gold or brass and silver.  Such opaque materials were much less effective as lighting, but the purpose of the lamp was symbolic as well as practical, related to the "Verse of Light".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/m/ottoman_mosque_lamp.aspx Lamp for the Ottoman restoration of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem], British Museum; Canby, 85, 180; Perry&lt;/ref&gt;  Mosque lamps are often shown in profile at the head of a [[prayer rug]] for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;Perry&lt;/ref&gt;  The decoration of the lamps often includes either the name or the symbol from [[Islamic heraldry]] of the donor, who usually gave a group of lamps.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Jones &amp; Mitchell, 143-144&lt;/ref&gt;  Other types of lighting in mosques were large metal lamp stands, like very wide candlesticks, which were also used in secular buildings.  These could be very intricately decorated.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later types==
[[File:Amman BW 33.JPG|thumb|Modern electric lighting in [[Amman]]]]
The elaborate decorated types were mostly succeeded by plain glass oil lamps with a simple rim at the top, by which they were attached to (typically) a circular metal bar. Often these hang in tiers. Mosques today typically retain the hanging circular fittings, but use electric lights and glass shades of various sorts, not essentially different from other glass [[lampshade]]s used in lighting other buildings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8384">[[Image:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo 094.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Oil sketch ''modello'' by Tiepolo, 69 × 55 cm, for [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo_016.jpg this] five metre high altarpiece]] 
An '''Oil sketch''' or '''oil study''' is an artwork made primarily in [[oil paint]] in preparation for a larger, finished work. Originally these were created as preparatory studies or '''[[modello|modelli]]''', especially so as to gain approval for the design of a larger commissioned painting. They were also used as designs for specialists in other media, such as [[printmaking]] or [[tapestry]], to follow. Later they were produced as independent works, often with no thought of being expanded into a full-size painting.

The [[sketch (drawing)|usual medium]] for ''modelli'' was the [[drawing]], but an oil sketch, even if done in a limited range of colours, could better suggest the tone of the projected work. It is also possible to more fully convey the flow and energy of a composition in paint. For a painter with exceptional technique, the production of an oil sketch may be as rapid as that of a drawing, and many practitioners had superb brush skills. In its rapidity of execution the oil sketch may be used not only to express movement and transient effects of light and color, its gestural nature may even represent a mimetic parallel to the action of the subject.

One of the earliest artists to produce oil sketches was [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]], a fine draftsman and pupil of [[Raphael]], but not one who had passed through the traditional Florentine training, with its emphasis on drawing.  His are all apparently related to works later done on a larger scale, and are themselves relatively large and on [[panel painting|panel]], with examples in the [[National Gallery, London]][https://web.archive.org/web/20070303121519/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG6594] and [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] being 75 and 65&amp;nbsp;cm tall respectively.  Sometimes a number of sketches for the same composition have survived.
[[Image:Théodore Géricault nu masculino.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Oil study of a male nude by [[Géricault]]]]
In the early 17th century the oil sketch became widely used, as it was suited to conveying the drama of [[Baroque painting|Baroque art]].  [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] made great use of them, as working studies, and as ''modelli'' for clients, his own assistants, engravers and tapestry-makers.  Their degree of finish varies accordingly.  Rubens' working practices influenced others, such as [[Anthony van Dyck]], who did not normally use oil sketches for the portraits that were the bulk of his output, but did for his [[old master print|print]] series the ''Iconographie'', and for other works such as a projected series of tapestries and some religious paintings. The ''[[Magistrate of Brussels]]'', recognised in England in 2013, may be a Van Dyck portrait oil sketch. 

Perhaps the first to produce oil sketches as independent works was [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], an amazingly fecund generator of compositions on a relatively small range of subjects.  He grew up and trained in [[Genoa]], and apparently had contact with both Rubens and Van Dyck during their stays there.  He produced a large number of small works, mostly on paper, in a mixture of mediums - drawings or [[gouache]]s finished in oil, oils with pen details - in fact, most possible permutations.  Detail is typically restricted to a few key points, with much of the subject conveyed in impressionistic fashion.  By this time a collectors' market for studies in drawing was well developed, and there was appreciation of their energy and freedom. Castiglione's sketches to some extent seem to trade off this appreciation, and look more unfinished and offhand than they actually are - a concept with a great future. 

A systematic producer of small ''modelli'' sketches on canvas with a high degree of finish was the 18th century [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], whose superb technique is often shown at its best in reducing a huge [[altarpiece]] to a lively but precise rendering at this small scale. At roughly the same time [[Jean Fragonard]] was producing a series of virtuosic ''Figures de fantaisie'', half-length portraits of imaginary subjects, purporting to have been painted in an hour.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, Richard R.: ''Impression: Painting Quickly in France'', pages 31–2. Yale University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:John Constable 025.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[John Constable]], 1827, 22 × 31 cm]]

By the 19th century oil sketches, often referred to as "oil studies" if from this period, had become very common, both as preparatory works, and for their own sake. The popularity of the oil sketch engendered the need to formulate distinctions. The ''esquisse'', or oil sketch, tended to be inspirational or imaginative, often originating in literature or art; the ''etude'', or study, tended to represent an observation of nature, painted from life. In academic painting the oil sketch took the form of the ''croquis'', a small and gestural compositional study, and the ''ébauche'', a dynamic laying-in of paint on the full-scale canvas, a temporary stage of the painting eventually leading to greater elaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, pages 31–9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[John Constable]] made extensive use of sketches for his landscapes, both of intimate scale, often in a [[sketchbook]] on paper, and in full-scale sketches for his largest "six-footers", which he used to refine his compositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/constable/ Tate Britain exhibition showing Constable's large landscapes along with their full-size oil sketches]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:Composition study for the portrait of professor gross thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Eakins]], Sketch for [[The Gross Clinic]].]][[image:Study for swimming thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|left|Thomas Eakins, 1884 ''Swimming Hole sketch'', [[oil paint|oil]] on [[fiberboard]] mounted on fiberboard, 22.1 × 27 cm., 8{{fraction|3|4}} × 10{{fraction|3|4}} inches, [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], [[Washington, D.C..]]]][[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Géricault]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] and [[Degas]] are other artists who often used them. For some oil sketches Degas painted in ''essence'', a technique by which the oil had been all but removed from the pigment, so that the artist was virtually drawing with pure paint. [[Seurat]] made many careful small oil sketches for his larger works. However, with the advent of [[Impressionism]], and then [[Modernism]], the practice of preparatory drawing and painting tended to decline. The abandonment by many artists of a high level of detail and finish in favor of a more [[painterly]] and spontaneous approach, reduced the distinction between a detailed sketch and a finished painting.  Sketches by Rubens or Tiepolo, for example, are at least as highly finished as many 20th century oil paintings.  Many artists, especially those working in more traditional styles, still use oil sketches today.  [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] is an example of an artist who called many of his most important, and largest, finished works "studies": examples are his [[Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion]] [[Tate Britain]], or his ''Study from Pope Innocent X'', auctioned in 2007 for $52.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0516/baconf.html RTE story &amp; picture]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait-of-Henry-Danvers-Earl-of-Danby.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby|Henry Danvers, Earl of Danby]], was outlawed in 1597 by a coroner's court for the murder of Henry Long. He went to France and joined the French army; two years later he was pardoned by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] and returned to England.]]

In [[legal history|historical legal systems]], an '''outlaw''' is declared as outside the protection of the [[law]]. In pre-modern societies, the criminal is withdrawn all legal protection, so that anyone is legally empowered to [[persecute]] or kill them. Outlawry was thus one of the harshest penalties in the legal system. In [[early Germanic law]], the [[death penalty]] is conspicuously absent, and outlawing is the most extreme punishment, presumably amounting to a death sentence in practice. The concept is known from [[Roman law]], as the status of ''[[homo sacer]]'', and persisted throughout the [[Middle Ages]].

In the [[common law]] of England, a "Writ of Outlawry" made the pronouncement ''[[Caput lupinum]]'' ("Let his be a wolf's head", literally "May he bear a wolfish head") with respect to its subject, using "head" [[Synecdoche|to refer to the entire]] person (cf. "per capita") and equating that person with a wolf ([[warg]]) in the eyes of the law: not only was the subject deprived of all legal rights of the law being outside the "law", but others could kill him on sight as if he were a wolf or other wild animal.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Women were declared "waived" rather than outlawed but it was effectively the same punishment.&lt;ref name=NAstaff-2012&gt;{{cite web|author=National Archives staff |date=26 January 2012 |title=The outlaw in medieval and early modern England|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/research-guides/outlawry.htm |publisher= British [[National Archives]]|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal history==

===Ancient Rome===
Among other forms of [[exile]], [[Roman law]] included the penalty of ''interdicere aquae et ignis'' ("to forbid water and fire"). People so penalized were required to leave Roman territory and forfeit their property. If they returned, they were effectively outlaws; providing them the use of fire or water was illegal, and they could be killed at will without legal penalty.{{sfn|Berger|p=507}}

''Interdicere aquae et ignis'' was traditionally imposed by the [[tribune of the plebs]], and is attested to have been in use during the [[First Punic War]] of the third century BC by [[Cato the Elder]].{{sfn|Kelly|2006|p=28}} It was later also applied by many other officials, such as the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], magistrates,{{sfn|Berger|p=507}} and [[Julius Caesar]] as a [[general]] and provincial governor during the [[Gallic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, Julius. ''De Bello Gallico'', book VI, section XLIV.&lt;/ref&gt; It fell out of use during the [[Principate|early Empire]].{{sfn|Berger|p=507}}

In [[English law|English]] [[common law]], an outlaw was{{when?|date=July 2018}} a person who had defied the laws of the realm, by such acts as ignoring a [[summons]] to court, or fleeing instead of appearing to plead when charged with a [[crime]].&lt;ref name=NAstaff-2012/&gt;

====Criminal====
The term ''outlawry ''referred to the formal procedure of declaring someone an outlaw, i.e. putting him outside the sphere of legal protection.&lt;ref name=NAstaff-2012/&gt; In the [[common law]] of England, a judgment of (criminal) outlawry was one of the harshest penalties in the legal system, since the outlaw could not use the legal system for protection, e.g. from [[mob justice]].  To be declared an outlaw was to suffer a form of [[civil death|civil]] or [[social death|social]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zygmunt |last=Bauman |year=n.d. |title=Modernity and Holocaust |page={{page needed|date=July 2012}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; death.  The outlaw was debarred from all civilized society. No one was allowed to give him food, shelter, or any other sort of support – to do so was to commit the crime of [[aiding and abetting]], and to be in danger of the ban oneself. A more recent concept of "[[Wanted poster#Dead or alive|wanted dead or alive]]" is similar, but implies that a trial is desired (namely if the wanted person is returned alive), whereas outlawry precludes a trial.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

An outlaw might be killed with impunity; and it was not only lawful but meritorious to kill a thief fleeing from justice — to do so was not [[Murder in English law|murder]]. A man who slew a thief was expected to declare the fact without delay, otherwise the dead man’s kindred might [[Compurgation|clear his name by their oath]] and require the slayer to pay weregild as for a true man.{{sfn|Pollock|Maitland|1968|p=53}}

By the rules of common law, a criminal outlaw did not need to be guilty of the crime for which he was an outlaw.  If a man was accused of a treason or [[felony]] but failed to appear in court to defend himself, he was deemed to be convicted of the said offence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'' (30th ed., 1938) page 71&lt;/ref&gt; If he was accused of a [[misdemeanour]], then he was guilty of a serious contempt of court which was itself a capital crime.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In the context of [[criminal law]], outlawry faded out, not so much by legal changes as by the greater population density of the country, which made it harder for wanted fugitives to evade capture; and by the adoption of international [[extradition]] pacts.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} It was obsolete by the time the offence was abolished in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;''Archbold'' (30th ed., 1938) page 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Archbold'' (31st ed., 1943) page 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1938, section 12&lt;/ref&gt;. Outlawry was, however, a living practice as of 1855: in 1841, a William John Bankes, formerly a MP on several times 1810...1835, was outlawed by due process of law for absenting himself from trial for indecent exposure, and died in 1855 in Venice as an outlaw.

====Civil====
There was also a doctrine of civil outlawry.  Civil outlawry did not carry the sentence of capital punishment.  It was however imposed on defendants who fled or evaded justice when sued for civil actions like debts or torts.  The punishments for civil outlawry were nevertheless harsh, including confiscation of chattels (movable property) left behind by the outlaw.&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone (1753), ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', Book 3, Chapter XIX "Of Process"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the civil context, outlawry became obsolescent in [[civil procedure]] by reforms that no longer required summoned [[defendant]]s to appear and plead.  Still, the possibility of being declared an outlaw for derelictions of [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] duty continued to exist in English law until 1879 and, in [[Scots law]] until the late 1940s.  Since then, failure to find the defendant and serve process is usually interpreted in favour of the plaintiff, and harsh penalties for mere nonappearance (merely presumed flight to escape justice) no longer apply.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}&lt;!--For the whole paragraph--&gt;

===In other countries===
[[File:Eric the Red.png|thumb|left|[[Erik the Red]] was outlawed by the Icelandic [[Althing]] for three years (so in about 982 he went [[viking]] and explored Greenland).]]
[[File:Ned kelly 1874.jpg|thumb|[[Ned Kelly]], with other members of his gang, were outlawed by the [[Parliament of Victoria|Parliament]] of the [[Australia]]n state of [[Victoria State|Victoria]] on 1 November 1878]]
Outlawry also existed in other ancient legal codes, such as the ancient [[Norsemen|Norse]] and [[Icelandic Commonwealth|Icelandic legal code]].

In early modern times, the term [[Vogelfrei]] and its cognates came to be used in Germany, the Low Countries and Scandinavia, referring to a person stripped of his civil rights being "free" for the taking like a bird.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt–Wiegand, Ruth (1998). "Vogelfrei". Handwörterbuch der Deutschen Rechtsgeschichte [Dictionary of the History of German Law]. 5: Straftheorie [Penal theory]. Berlin: Schmidt. pp. 930–932. {{ISBN|3-503-00015-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Germany and Slavic countries in 15th–19th centuries groups of outlaws composed from former prisoners, soldiers etc. became an important social phenomenon. They lived from robbery and their activity was often supported by local inhabitants from lower classes (as a form of a social people resistance against oppressive political and economic systems). The best known are [[Juraj Jánošík]] and [[Jakub Surovec]] in Slovakia, [[Oleksa Dovbush]] in Ukraine, [[Rózsa Sándor]] in Hungary, [[Schinderhannes]] and [[Hans Kohlhase]] in Germany etc.

The concept of outlawry was reintroduced to British law by several Australian colonial governments in the late 19th century to deal with the menace of [[bushranging]]. The [[Felons Apprehension Act (1865)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/sessionalview/sessional/act/1865-2a.pdf | author=New South Wales government website | title = Text of the Felons Apprehension Act (1865) |accessdate= 4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[New South Wales]] provided that a judge could, upon proof of sufficiently notorious conduct, issue a special [[bench warrant]] requiring a person to submit themselves to police custody before a given date, or be declared an outlaw. An outlawed person could be apprehended "alive or dead" by any of the Queen's subjects, "whether a constable or not", and without "being accountable for using of any deadly weapon in aid of such apprehension." Similar provisions were passed in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.anzlhsejournal.auckland.ac.nz/pdfs_2005/Eburn.pdf | author = ANZLH E-Journal | title=
Outlawry in Colonial Australia: The Felons Apprehension Acts 1865-1899  |accessdate= 4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the provisions of the New South Wales Felons Apprehension Act were not exercised after the end of the bushranging era, they remained on the statute book until 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.anzlhsejournal.auckland.ac.nz/pdfs_2005/Eburn.pdf | author = ANZLH E-Journal | title =
Outlawry in Colonial Australia: The Felons Apprehension Acts 1865-1899  |accessdate= 4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Third Reich]] made extensive use of outlawry in the persecution of Jews or other persons deemed undesirable to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shirer, William L. |year=2011|title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany|pages=233, 439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As political weapon==
[[File:Eastlake - Napoleon on the Bellerophon.jpg|thumb|[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] on [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']] after his surrender to the British in 1815.]]
There have been many instances in military and/or political conflicts throughout History whereby one side declares the other as being "illegal", notorious cases being the use of [[Proscription]] in Republican Rome's civil wars.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}&lt;!--For the whole paragraph--&gt; In later times there was the notable case of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] whom the [[Congress of Vienna]], on 13 March 1815, [[s:Declaration at the Congress of Vienna|declared he had "deprived himself of the protection of the law"]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/napoleon/time7.html Timeline: The Congress of Vienna, the Hundred Days, and Napoleon's Exile on St Helena], Center of Digital Initiatives, [[Brown University]] Library&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the government of the [[First Spanish Republic]], unable to reduce the [[cantonalism|Cantonalist]] rebellion centered in [[Cartagena, Spain]], declared the Cartagena fleet  to be "[[piracy|piratic]]", which allowed any nation to prey on it.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Taking the opposite road, some outlaws became political leaders, such as [[Ethiopia]]'s Kassa Hailu who became Emperor [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Popular usage==
{{main|Outlaw (stock character)}}
{{further|Social bandits}}
Though the judgment of outlawry is now obsolete (even though it inspired the ''pro forma'' [[Outlawries Bill]] which is still to this day introduced in the [[British House of Commons]] during the [[State Opening of Parliament]]), romanticised outlaws became [[stock character]]s in several fictional settings.  This was particularly so in the United States, where outlaws were popular subjects of newspaper coverage and stories in the 19th century, and 20th century fiction and [[Western movie]]s.  Thus, "outlaw" is still commonly used to mean those violating the law&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary at 1255 (4th ed. 1951), citing ''Oliveros v. Henderson'', 116 S.C. 77, 106 S.E. 855, 859.&lt;/ref&gt; or, by extension, those living that lifestyle, whether actual criminals evading the law or those merely opposed to "law-and-order" notions of conformity and authority (such as the "[[outlaw country]]" music movement in the 1970s).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21798">'''Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances''' (PBTs) are a class of compounds that have high resistance to degradation from [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic material|biotic]] factors, high mobility in the environment and high toxicity.  Because of these factors PBTs have been observed to have a high order of [[bioaccumulation]] and [[biomagnification]], very long retention times in various media, and widespread distribution across the globe.  Majority of PBTs in the environment are either created through industry or are unintentional byproducts.&lt;ref name="Blais"&gt;Blais J. 2005. Biogeochemistry of persistent bioaccumulative toxicants: processes affecting the transport of contaminants to remote areas. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 62: 236-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Persistent organic pollutant]]s (POPs) were the focal point of the Stockholm Convention 2001 due to their persistence, ability to biomagnify and the threat posed to both human health and the environment.  The goal of the Stockholm Convention was to determine the classification of POPs, create measures to eliminate production/use of POPs, and establish proper disposal of the compounds in an environmentally friendly manner.&lt;ref name="Ridding"&gt;Ridding the world of POPs: A guide to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants". United Nations Environment Programme. April 2005. Retrieved 2008-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently the majority of the global community is actively involved with this program but a few still resist, most notably the U.S.  

Similar to POPs classification, the PBT classification of chemicals was developed in 1997 by the Great Lakes Binational Toxic Strategy (GLBNS).  Signed by both the U.S and Canada, the GLBNS classified PBTs in one of two categories, level I and level II.&lt;ref name="USEPA"&gt;USEPA. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement U.S Eighth Response to International Joint Commission.  Retrieved June 6, 2012 http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/glwqa/eigthresponse.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Level I PBTs are top priority which currently, as of 2005, contained 12 compounds or classes of compounds.&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;

The GLBNS is administered by the U.S [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA) and  [[Environment Canada]].&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;  Following the GLBNS, the Multimedia Strategy for Priority Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic Pollutants (PBT Strategy) was drafted by the USEPA.&lt;ref name=USEPA /&gt; The PBT Strategy led to the implementation of PBT criteria in several regulational policies. Two main policies that were changed by the PBT strategy were the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) which required more rigid chemical reporting and the New Chemical Program (NCP) under the Toxics Substances Control Act (TSCA) which required screening for PBTs and PBT properties.&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;

==Compounds==

===General===
PBTs are a unique classification of chemicals that have and will continue to impact human health and the environment worldwide.  The three main attributes of a PBT (persistence, bioaccumulative and toxic) each have a huge role in the risk posed by these compounds.&lt;ref name="Blais" /&gt;

===Persistence===
PBTs may have a high [[environmental mobility]] relative to other contaminants mainly due to their resistance to degradation (persistence).  This allows PBTs to travel far and wide in both the atmosphere and in aqueous environments.  The low degradation rates of PBTs allow these chemicals to be exposed to both biotic and abiotic factors while maintaining a relatively stable concentration.  Another factor that makes PBTs especially dangerous are the degradation products which are often relatively as toxic as the parent compound. These factors have resulted in global contamination most notable in remote areas such as the arctic and high elevation areas which are far from any source of PBTs.&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;

===Bioaccumulation and biomagnification===
The bioaccumulative ability of PBTs follows suit with the persistence attribute by the high resistance to degradation by biotic factors, especially with in organisms.  Bioaccumulation is the result of a toxic substance being taken up at a higher rate than being removed from an organism.  For PBTs this is caused mainly by a resistance to degradation, biotic and abiotic.  PBTs usually are highly insoluble in water which allows them to enter organisms at faster rates through fats and other nonpolar regions on an organism.  Bioaccumulation of a toxicant can lead to biomagnification through a [[trophic web]] which has resulted in massive concern in areas with especially low [[trophic diversity]].  Biomagnification results in higher trophic organisms accumulating more PBTs than those of lower trophic levels through consumption of the PBT contaminated lower trophic organisms.&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;

===Toxicity===
The toxicity of this class of compounds is high with very low concentrations of a PBT required to enact an effect on an organism compared to most other contaminants.  This high toxicity along with the persistence allows for the PBT to have detrimental effects in remote areas around the globe where there is not a local source of PBTs.  The bioaccumulation and magnification along with the high toxicity and persistence has the ability to destroy and/or irreparably damage trophic systems, especially the higher trophic levels, globally.  It is this reason that PBTs have become an area of focus in global politics.&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;

===Specific toxicants===

====PCBs====
Historically, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] were used extensively for industrial purposes such as [[coolant]]s, insulating fluids, and as a [[plasticizer]]. These contaminants enter the environment through both use and disposal. Due to extensive concern from the public, legal, and scientific sectors indicating that PCBs are likely [[carcinogen]]s and potential to adversely impact the environment, these compounds were banned in 1979 in the United States.&lt;ref name="USEPAA"&gt;USEPA. Basic Information on PCBs. Accessed June 1, 2012.   http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/hazard/tsd/pcbs/pubs/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The ban included the use of PCBs in uncontained sources, such as adhesives, [[fire retardant]] fabric treatments, and plasticizers in paints and cements.&lt;ref name="USEPAA" /&gt; Containers that are completely enclosed such as transformers and capacitors are exempt from the ban.&lt;ref name=USEPAA /&gt;

The inclusion of PCBs as a PBT may be contributed to their low water solubility, high stability, and semi-volatility facilitating their long range transport and accumulation in organisms.&lt;ref name="Ritter"&gt;Ritter L; Solomon KR, Forget J, Stemeroff M, O'Leary C.. "Persistent organic pollutants". United Nations Environment Programme. Retrieved 2007-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The persistence of these compounds is due to the high resistance to oxidation, reduction, addition, elimination and electrophilic substitution.&lt;ref name="Amy"&gt;Amy Boate, Greg Deleersnyder, Jill Howarth, Anita Mirabelli, and Leanne Peck (2004). "Chemistry of PCBs". Retrieved 2007-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The toxicological interactions of PCBs are affected by the number and position of the chlorine atoms, without ortho substitution are referred as coplanar and all others as non-coplanar.&lt;ref name="Ritter" /&gt; Non-coplanar PCBs may cause neurotoxicity by interfering with intracellular signal transduction dependent on calcium.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;Simon T, Britt JK, James RC (2007). "Development of a neurotoxic equivalence scheme of relative potency for assessing the risk of PCB mixtures". [[Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology]] 48(2): 148–70.

DOI:10.1006/taap.1999.8826. {{PMID|10631123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coplanar PCBs are similar to dioxins and furans, both bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in organisms and may exert dioxin-like effects, in addition to the effects shared with non-coplanar PCBs.&lt;ref name="Safe"&gt;Safe, S. and Hutzinger, O. (1984). "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs): biochemistry, toxicology, and mechanism of action". Crit. Rev.

Effects of PBTs may include increase in disease, lesions in [[benthic]] feeders, spawning loss, change in age-structured populations of fish, and tissue contamination in fish and shellfish.&lt;ref name="Lehmann"&gt;Lehmann DW, Levine JF, Law JM. 2007.

Patterns of Bioaccumulation of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ether and Polychlorinated Biphenyl Congeners in Marine Mussels. Environ. Sci. Technol. 43:3700–3704.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans and other organisms, which consume shellfish and/or fish contaminated with persistent bioaccumulative pollutants, have the potential to bioaccumulate these chemicals.&lt;ref name="Ridding" /&gt; This may put these organisms at risk of mutagenic, teratogenic, and/or carcinogenic effects.&lt;ref name="Ridding" /&gt; Correlations have been found between elevated exposure to PCB mixtures and alterations in liver enzymes, hepatomegaly, and dermatological effects such as rashes have been reported.&lt;ref name="Ritter" /&gt;

====DDT====
One PBT of concern includes [[DDT]] (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), an organochlorine that was widely used as an insecticide during World War II to protect soldiers from malaria carried by mosquitoes.&lt;ref name="Ridding" /&gt; Due to the low cost and low toxicity to mammals, the widespread use of DDT for agricultural and commercial motives started around 1940. However, the overuse of DDT lead to insect tolerance to the chemical. It was also discovered that DDT had a high toxicity to fish. DDT was banned in the US by 1973 because of building evidence that DDT’s stable structure, high fat solubility, and low rate of metabolism, caused it to bioaccumulate in animals.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, Karl. 1997. DDT a Banned Insecticide. Molecules of the Month. http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/mom/ddt/ddt.html&lt;/ref&gt; While DDT is banned in the US, other countries such as China and Turkey still produce and use it quite regularly through [[Dicofol]], an insecticide that has DDT as an impurity.&lt;ref name="Turgut"&gt;Turgut, C., Cengiz, G., Cutright, T. 2009. Contents and sources of DDT impurities in dicofol formulations in Turkey. Environmental science and pollution research international. Volume 16. issue 2. page 214&lt;/ref&gt; This continued use in other parts of the world is still a global problem due to the mobility and persistence of DDT.

The initial contact from DDT is on vegetation and soil. From here, the DDT can travel many routes, for instance, when plants and vegetation are exposed to the chemical to protect from insects, the plants may absorb it. Then these plants may either be consumed by humans or other animals. These consumers ingest the chemical and begin metabolizing the toxicant, accumulating more through ingestion, and posing health risks to the organism, their offspring, and any predators. Alternatively the ingestion of the contaminated plant by insects may lead to tolerance by the organism. Another route is the chemical travelling through the soil and ending up in ground water and in human water supply.&lt;ref name="Kan"&gt;Kan, A., Tomson, M. 2009. Ground Water Transport of Hydrophobic Organic Compounds in the Presence of Dissolved Organic Matter.&lt;/ref&gt; Or in the case that the soil is near a moving water system, the chemical could end up in large freshwater systems or the ocean where fish are at high risk from the toxicological effects of DDT.&lt;ref name="Woodwell"&gt;Woodwell, G., Craig, P., Johnson H. 1971. DDT in the Biosphere: Where Does it Go? Science. Vol. 174 no. 4014 pp. 1101-1107.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the most common transport route is the evaporation of DDT into the atmosphere followed by condensation and eventually precipitation where it is released into environments anywhere on earth.&lt;ref name="Stewart Jr"&gt;Stewart Jr, C., Woodwell G., Craig, P., Johnson, H.1972. Atmospheric Circulation of DDT. Science. 724-725.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the long-range transport of DDT, the presence of this harmful toxicant will continue as long as it is still used anywhere and until the current contamination eventually degrades. Even after its complete discontinued use, it will still remain in the environment for many more years after because of DDT’s persistent attributes.&lt;ref name=Woodwell /&gt;

Previous studies have shown that DDT and other similar chemicals directly elicited a response and effect from excitable membranes.&lt;ref name="Vijverberg"&gt;Vijverberg, H., Van Den Bercken, J. 1990. Neurotoxicological Effects And The Mode of Action of Pyrethroid Insecticides. Informa Healthcare: Critical Reviews in Toxicology. Vol. 21, No. 2 , Pages 105-126.&lt;/ref&gt; DDT causes membranes such as sense organs and nerves endings to activate repetitively by slowing down the ability for the sodium channel to close and stop releasing sodium ions. The sodium ions are what polarize the opposing synapse after it has depolarized from firing.&lt;ref name="Vijverbergg"&gt;Vijverberg, H., Van der Zalm, J., Van den Bercken, J. 1982. Similar mode of action of pyrethroids and DDT on sodium channel gating in myelinated nerves. Nature. 295, 601 - 603.&lt;/ref&gt; This inhibition of closing the sodium ion channel can lead to a variety of problems including a dysfunctional nervous system, decreased motor abilities/function/control, reproductive impairment (egg-shell thinning in birds), and development deficiencies. Presently, DDT has been labeled as a possible human carcinogen based on animal liver tumor studies.&lt;ref&gt;''USEPA. 2012. DDT A Brief History and Status. United States Environmental Protection Agency. http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/factsheets/chemicals/ddt-brief-history-status.htm''&lt;/ref&gt; DDT toxicity on humans have been associated with dizziness, tremors, irritability, and convulsions. Chronic toxicity has led to long term neurological and cognitive issues.&lt;ref name="WTC"&gt;Washington Toxics Coalition. 2002. PCBs and DDT. Washington Toxics Coalition.

====Mercury====

;Inorganic
Inorganic mercury (elemental mercury) is less bioavailable and less toxic than that of organic mercury but is still toxic nonetheless.  It is released into the environment through both natural sources as well as human activity, and it has the capability to travel long distances through the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Clarkson"&gt;Clarkson T., Magos L. 2006 The Toxicology of mercury and Its Chemical Compounds. Critical Reviews in Toxicology. 36:609-662.&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 2,700 to 6,000 tons of elemental mercury are released via natural activity such as volcanoes and erosion.  Another 2,000 – 3,000 tons are released by human industrial activities such as coal combustion, metal smelting and cement production.&lt;ref name="Tchounwou"&gt;Tchounwou P., Ayensu W., Ninashvili W., Sutton D. 2003. Environmental Exposure to Mercury and Its Toxicopathologic Implications for Public Health. Environmental Toxicology 18:149-175.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to its high volatility and atmospheric residence time of around 1 year, mercury has the ability to travel across continents before being deposited.  Inorganic mercury has a wide spectrum of toxicological effects that include damage to the respiratory, nervous, immune and excretory systems in humans.&lt;ref name=Clarkson /&gt;  Inorganic mercury also possesses the ability to bioaccumulate individuals and biomagnify through trophic systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Morel F., Kraepiel A., Amyot. 1998. The Chemical Cycle and Bioaccumulation of Mercury. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 29:543-566''&lt;/ref&gt;

;Organic
Organic mercury is significantly more detrimental to the environment than its inorganic form due to its widespread distribution as well as its higher mobility, general toxicity and rates of bioaccumulation than that of the inorganic form.  Environmental organic mercury is mainly created by the transformation of elemental (inorganic) mercury via anaerobic bacteria into methylated mercury (organic).&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;Olson B., Cooper R. 2003. Comparison of Aerobic and Anaerobic Methylation of Mercuric Chloride by San Francisco Bay Sediments. Water Research 10:113-116.&lt;/ref&gt;  The global distribution of organic mercury is the result of general mobility of the compound, activation via bacteria and transportation from animal consumption.&lt;ref name="Blais" /&gt;  Organic mercury shares a lot of the same effects as the inorganic form but it has a higher toxicity due to its higher mobility in the body, especially its ability to readily move across the blood brain barrier.&lt;ref name=Clarkson /&gt;

;Ecological Impact of Hg
The high toxicity of both forms of mercury (especially organic mercury) poses a threat to almost all organisms that comes in contact with it.  This is one of the reasons that there is such high attention to mercury in the environment but even more so than its toxicity is both its persistence and atmospheric retention times.  The ability of mercury to readily volatilize allows it to enter the atmosphere and travel far and wide.  Unlike most other PBTs that have atmospheric half-lives between 30 min and 7 days mercury has an atmospheric residence time of at least 1 year.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;Mason R., Sheu G. 2002. Role of the Ocean in the Global Mercury Cycle. Global Biogeochemical Cycles. 16:1093-1107.&lt;/ref&gt;  This atmospheric retention time along with mercury’s resistance to degradation factors such as electromagnetic radiation and oxidation, which are two of the main factors leading to degradation of many PBTs in the atmosphere, allows mercury from any source to be transported extensively.  This characteristic of mercury transportation globally along with its high toxicity is the reasoning behind its incorporation into the BNS list of PBTs.&lt;ref name="Blais" /&gt;

==Notable PBT environmental impacts==

===Japan===
The realization of the adverse effects from environmental pollution were made public from several disasters that occurred globally. In 1965, it was recognized that extensive mercury pollution by the Chisso chemical factory in Minamata, Japan due to improper handling of industrial wastes resulted in significant effects to the humans and organisms exposed.&lt;ref name="Ministry"&gt;The Ministry of the Environment, (2002)."Minamata Disease: The History and Measures”. Retrieved January 17, 2007. http://www.env.go.jp/en/chemi/hs/minamata2002/&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury was released into the environment as methyl mercury (bioavailable state) into industrial wastewater and was then bioaccumulated by shellfish and fish in [[Minamata Bay]] and the [[Shiranui Sea]].&lt;ref name=Ministry /&gt; When the contaminated seafood was consumed by the local populace it caused a neurological syndrome, coined [[Minamata disease]].&lt;ref name=Ministry /&gt;  Symptoms include general muscle weakness, hearing damage, reduced field of vision, and ataxia.&lt;ref name=Ministry /&gt; The Minamata disaster contributed to the global realization of the potential dangers from environmental pollution and to the characterization of PBTs.

===Puget Sound===
Despite the ban on DDT 30 years earlier and years of various efforts to clean up [[Puget Sound]] from DDT and PCB’s, there is still a significant presence of both compounds which pose a constant threat to human health and the environment.&lt;ref name=WTC /&gt; [[Harbor seal]]s (''Phoca vitulina''), a common marine species in the Puget Sound area have been the focus of a few studies to monitor and examine the effects of DDT accumulation and magnification in aquatic wildlife. One study tagged and reexamined seal pups every 4 to 5 years to be tested for DDT concentrations.&lt;ref name="Calambokidis"&gt;Calambokidis, J., Jeffries, S., Ross, P., Ikonomou, M. 1999. Temporal Trends in Contaminants in Puget Sound Harbor Seal. Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Publications. http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00964/&lt;/ref&gt; The trends showed the pups to be highly contaminated; this means their prey are also highly contaminated.&lt;ref name=Calambokidis /&gt; Due to DDT’s high lipid solubility, it also has the ability to accumulate in the local populace who consume seafood from the area. This also translates to women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, since DDT will be transferred from the mother to child.&lt;ref name=WTC /&gt; Both animal and human health risk to DDT will continue to be an issue in Puget Sound especially because of the cultural significance of fish in this region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3852">'''Pseudolaw''' consists of statements, beliefs, or practices that are claimed to be based on accepted law or legal doctrine, but which deviate significantly from most conventional understandings of law and jurisprudence, or which originate from non-existent statutes or legal principals the advocate or adherent of incorrectly believes exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powell|first1=Corey|title=Here comes pseudolaw, a weird little cousin of pseudoscience|url=https://aeon.co/ideas/here-comes-pseudolaw-a-weird-little-cousin-of-pseudoscience|accessdate=January 4, 2018|work=[[Aeon (digital magazine)|Aeon]]|date=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as "legalistic gibberish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=T.C.

Followers of such ideologies can cause problems for courts and government administrators by filing unusual applications that are difficult to process. Courts in Canada refer to such arguments as '''Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments''', and have called them frivolous and vexatious.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://canlii.ca/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html Meads v. Meads, 2012 ABQB 571]''(CanLII), Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, 18 September 2012, para. 77&lt;/ref&gt; There is no recorded instance of such tactics being upheld in a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt |title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems |last1=Bizzle |first1=Legal |date=18 November 2011 |website=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common among psudolegal beliefs is a belief that one is partially or fully sovereign from the country in which they live, and believe that no laws, or only certain laws, apply to them. Groups espousing such pseudolegal beliefs include [[freemen on the land]] and the [[sovereign citizen movement]]. Some believe that their state itself is illegitimate, such as [[Reichsbürgerbewegung]].

Also under the umbrella of pseudolegal arguments are [[conspiracy theorists]] who believe there is a secret parallel legal system that one can access through certain means, like using a secret phrase or by placing stamps on the right place on documents. For example, the [[redemption movement]] believes that a secret fund is created for everyone at birth by the government, and that a procedure exists to "redeem" or reclaim money from this fund. See [[tax protester conspiracy arguments]] for a discussion of these beliefs related to tax law. Many of these revolve around the "legal name fraud" movement, which believes that birth certificates give the state legal ownership of a [[personal name]] and refusing to use this name therefore removes oneself from a court's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalgleish|first1=Katherine|title=Guns, border guards, and the Magna Carta: the Freemen-on-the-Land are back in Alberta courts|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=018e9df4-b9fe-4c88-9db9-d784f423348c|website=lexology.com|publisher=Lexology|accessdate=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=John|title=The mystery of the 'legal name fraud' billboards|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36499750|accessdate=January 4, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various groups advocate that one can avoid this state ownership by distinguishing between capitalized and non-capitalized versions of one's name, or by adding punctuation to one's name. See [[strawman theory]] (also known as the capital letters argument) for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3214">'''Robert E. Somol Jr.''' is an [[architectural theory|architectural theorist]] currently serving as the Director of the School of Architecture at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. 

==Education==

He holds an A.B. from [[Brown University]] (1982), a J.D. from [[Harvard Law School]], and a Ph.D. in the history of culture from the [[University of Chicago]] (1997).

==Academic career==

Previously a professor in the Knowlton School of Architecture at the [[Ohio State University]], he has taught design and theory at [[Princeton University]], [[UCLA]], the University of Illinois at Chicago, [[Rice University]], [[Columbia University]], the [[Taubman College|University of Michigan]], and the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]].

==Writing==

Somol is also an author and a contributor to several publications. His writings, which have appeared in publications ranging from ''[[Assemblage (journal)|Assemblage]]'' to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', focus on modernism and its modes of repetition, the emergence of the diagram in postwar architecture, landscape and interior urbanism, and the criticism of contemporary architectural practices and pedagogy. 

He was a guest editor for volume five of the contemporary architecture journal ''[[Log (journal)|Log]]'' and served as a member of the editorial board of ''ANY'' magazine, which explored the cultural role of architecture and its relationships to other disciplines. He is also a member of the Research Board of the [[Berlage Institute]] in [[Rotterdam]].

Somol as well presented an academic paper at the [[Holcim Forum for Sustainable Construction]] 2007, which was organised by the [[Holcim Foundation for Sustainable Construction]].

==Design==

Somol was formerly a principal at the [[Los Angeles]] architecture firm P XS. He is the co-designer of "off-use," an award-winning studio and residence in Los Angeles (2002) that, according to his obtuse cryptology, "combines the speculative discipline of modernism with the material excesses of mass culture."

== Work ==
Since the 1960s, Roy Ascott has been a practitioner of [[interactive]] [[computer art]], [[electronic art]], [[cybernetic art]] and [[telematic art]].


The historian of art and technology [[Frank Popper]] writes of Roy Ascott:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Frank|title=From Technological to Virtual Art|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-262-16230-2|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Roy Ascott was among the first artists to launch an appeal for total spectator participation ... At present, Ascott is one of the most outstanding artists and theoreticians in the field of telematics.
}}

In his first show (1964) at the Molton Gallery, London [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_shanken.html], he exhibited ''Analogue Structures and Diagram Boxes'', comprising change-paintings and other works in wood, perspex and glass. In 1964 Ascott published "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in ''Cybernetica: journal of the International Association for Cybernetics'' (Namur). In 1968,  he was elected Associate Member of the Institution of Computer Science, London (proposed by [[Gordon Pask]]). In 1972, he became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]].

Ascott has shown at the [[Venice Biennale]], [[Shanghai Biennale]], Electra Paris, [[Ars Electronica]], [[V2 Institute for the Unstable Media]]  [http://framework.v2.nl/archive/archive/leaf/other/default.xslt/nodenr-143122], Milan Triennale, Biennale do Mercosul, [[Brazil]], European Media Festival, and gr2000az at [[Graz]], Austria. His first telematic project was ''La Plissure du Texte'' (1983),  [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_ascott.html]  an online work of "distributed authorship" involving artists around the world. The second was his "gesamtdatenwerk" ''Aspects of Gaia: Digital Pathways across the Whole Earth'' (1989), an installation for the [[Ars Electronica]] Festival in Linz, discussed by  (inter alia) Matthew Wilson Smith in ''The Total Work of Art: from Bayreuth to Cyberspace'', New York: Routledge, 2007. Retrospective exhibitions of his work were shown in May 2009 at Plymouth Arts Centre, England,  then in the Incheon International Digital Arts Festival, Incheon, South Korea in September 2010, and at [[SPACE (studios)]] in Hackney, London in 2011. ''Syncretic Cybernetics'', a comprehensive exhibition of his work, was featured in the 9th [[Shanghai Biennale]] 2012. ''Roy Ascott: The Analogues'' (featuring his work of the 1960s) was shown at the Plug-in Institute ofContemporary Arts [http://www.plugin.org/exhibitions/2013/roy-ascott-analogues], Winnipeg, July-Sept 2013. In September 2014, a mini retrospective of his work was shown in Linz, at the time of his Ars Electronica Golden Nica award [http://www.art-in-berlin.de/royascott2.mp4]. He discussed his work on Geran TV [http://www.art-in-tv.de/videoplaytv.php?id=1525].
The seminal work of 1962, "Video-Roget" [http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/ascott-video-roget-t13977] was acquired in 2014, by the Tate Gallery, London for its permanent collection. Two key works were included in "Electronic Superhighway", at the Whitechapel Gallery, London in 2016 [http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/about/press/press-release-electronic-superhighway/]. "Art in Europe 1945-68" shown in ZKM, Karlsruhr, Germany Oct 2016/ Jan 2017, included his "Change-painting 1966" [http://zkm.de/en/event/2016/10/art-in-europe-1945-1968]. His early work was the subject of the exhibition "Roy Ascott: Form has Behaviour", at the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, Jan/Apr 2017 [https://www.henry-moore.org/whats-on/2017/01/25/roy-ascott-form-has-behaviour]. 

== Interactive computer art ==
Since the 1960s, Ascott has been a working with interactive [[computer art]], [[telematic art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artmuseum.net/w2vr/timeline/Ascott.html artmuseum.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems art]]. Ascott built a theoretical framework for approaching interactive artworks, which brought together certain characteristics of [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]], [[Fluxus]], [[Happenings]], and [[Pop Art]] with the science of [[cybernetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouthartscentre.org/art/royascott.html|title=Plymouth Arts Centre Blog|work=Plymouth Arts Centre Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also influenced by the writings of [[Gordon Pask]], [[Anthony Stafford Beer]], [[William Ross Ashby]], and [[Frank Honywill George|F.H. George]].&lt;ref&gt;A critical survey of Ascott's work is provided by [[Edward A. Shanken]] in his introductory essay "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott" in Ascott, R. 2003.

The '''scientific community''' is a diverse network of interacting [[scientist]]s. It includes many "[[working groups|sub-communities]]" working on particular scientific fields, and within particular institutions; interdisciplinary and cross-institutional activities are also significant. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivity]] is expected to be achieved by the [[scientific method]]. [[Peer review]], through discussion and debate within journals and conferences, assists in this objectivity by maintaining the quality of research methodology and interpretation of results.&lt;ref name=SCMet&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kornfeld |first1=W |last2=Hewitt |first2=CE |year=1981 |title=The Scientific Community Metaphor |journal=IEEE Trans. Sys., Man, and Cyber. |volume=SMC-11 |issue=1 |pages=24–33 |url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/5693/AIM-641.pdf?sequence=2 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of scientific communities==

The eighteenth century had some societies made up of men who studied nature, also known as [[natural philosophers]] and [[natural history|natural historians]], which included even amateurs. As such these societies were more like local clubs and groups with diverse interests than actual scientific communities, which usually had interests on specialized disciplines.&lt;ref name=Cahan /&gt; Though there were a few older societies of men who studied nature such as the [[Royal Society of London]], the concept of scientific communities emerged in the second half of the 19th century, not before, because it was in this century that the language of modern science emerged, the professionalization of science occurred, specialized institutions were created, and the specialization of scientific disciplines and fields occurred.&lt;ref name=Cahan /&gt;

For instance, the term ''[[scientist]]'' was first coined by the naturalist-theologian [[William Whewell]] in 1834 and the wider acceptance of the term along with the growth of specialized societies allowed for researchers to see themselves as a part of a wider imagined community, similar to the concept of nationhood.&lt;ref name=Cahan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cahan|first1=David|editor1-last=Cahan|editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226089287|pages=291–328|chapter=Institutions and Communities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership, status and interactions==
Membership in the community is generally, but not exclusively, a function of [[education]], [[employment|employment status]], research activity and [[research institute|institutional affiliation]]. [[Achieved status|Status]] within the community is highly correlated with [[Academic publishing|publication record]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Yearley | first1 = Steven | last2 = Collins | first2 = Harry M. | author-link1 = Steven Yearley | author-link2 = Harry Collins | contribution = Epistemological chicken | editor-last = Pickering | editor-first = Andrew | editor-link = Andrew Pickering | title = Science as practice and culture | pages = 301–326 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780226668017 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also depends on the status within the institution and the status of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Höhle, Ester (2015). From apprentice to agenda-setter: comparative analysis of the influence of contract conditions on roles in the
scientific community. Studies in Higher Education 40(8), 1423-1437. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03075079.2015.1060704&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers can hold roles of different degrees of influence inside the scientific community. Researchers of a stronger influence can act as mentors for early career researchers and steer the direction of research in the community like ageanda setters.&lt;ref&gt;Höhle, Ester (2015). From apprentice to agenda-setter: comparative analysis of the influence of contract conditions on roles in the scientific community. Studies in Higher Education 40(8), 1423-1437.http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03075079.2015.1060704&lt;/ref&gt; 
Scientists are usually trained in [[academia]] through [[university|universities]]. As such, [[academic degree|degrees]] in the relevant scientific sub-disciplines are often considered prerequisites in the relevant community. In particular, the [[PhD]] with its [[doctoral dissertation|research requirements]] functions as a marker of being an important integrator into the community, though continued membership is dependent on maintaining connections to other researchers through publication, technical contributions, and [[scientific conference|conferences]]. After obtaining a PhD an academic scientist may continue through being on an academic position, receiving a [[postdoc|post-doctoral fellowships]] and onto [[professor]]ships. Other scientists make contributions to the scientific community in alternate ways such as in [[industry]], [[education]], [[think tank]]s, or the [[government]].

Members of the same community do not need to work together.&lt;ref name=SCMet /&gt; Communication between the members is established by disseminating research work and hypotheses through articles in [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journals|journals]], or by attending [[academic conference|conferences]] where new research is presented and ideas exchanged and discussed. There are also many informal methods of communication of scientific work and results as well. And many in a coherent community may actually ''not'' communicate all of their work with one another, for various professional reasons.

==Speaking for the scientific community==
Unlike in previous centuries when the community of scholars were all members of few [[learned society|learned societies]] and similar institutions, there are no singular bodies or individuals which can be said today to speak for all science or all scientists. This is partly due to the specialized training most scientists receive in very few fields. As a result, many would lack expertise in all the other fields of the sciences. For instance, due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists, most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists, rather than individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simonton|first=Dean Keith|title=After Einstein: Scientific genius is extinct|journal=Nature|volume=493|issue=7434|pages=602|doi=10.1038/493602a|pmid=23364725|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are still multiple societies and academies in many countries which help consolidate some opinions and research to help guide public discussions on matters of policy and government-funded research. For example, the [[United States]]' [[National Academy of Science]] (NAS) and [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Society]] sometimes act as surrogates when the opinions of the scientific community need to be ascertained by [[public policy|policy makers]] or the national [[government]], but the statements of the National Academy of Science or the Royal Society are not binding on scientists nor do they necessarily reflect the opinions of every scientist in a given community since membership is often exclusive, their commissions are explicitly focused on serving their governments, and they have never "shown systematic interest in what rank-and file scientists think about scientific matters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Steve|title=Dissent Over Descent|year=2007|publisher=Icon|isbn=9781840468045|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusivity of membership in these types of organizations can be seen in their election processes in which only existing members can officially nominate others for candidacy of membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruce Alberts|first=Kenneth R. Fulton|title=Election to the National Academy of Sciences: Pathways to membership|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/102/21/7405.full|doi=10.1073/pnas.0503457102|pmid=16586925|volume=102|issue=21|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=7405–7406|pmc=1140467|date=2005-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Election to the Fellowship of the Royal Society|url=http://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/election/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very unusual for organizations like the National Academy of Science to engage in external research projects since they normally focus on preparing scientific reports for government agencies.&lt;ref name="US Academy uncharted waters"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shen|first=Helen|title=Oil money takes US academy into uncharted waters|journal=Nature|volume=494|issue=7437|pages=295|doi=10.1038/494295a|pmid=23426305|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of how rarely the NAS engages in external and active research can be seen in its struggle to prepare and overcome hurdles, due to its lack of experience in coordinating research grants and major research programs on the environment and health.&lt;ref name="US Academy uncharted waters" /&gt;

Nevertheless, general [[scientific consensus]] is a concept which is often referred to when dealing with questions that can be subject to [[scientific method]]ology. While the consensus opinion of the community is not always easy to ascertain or fix due to paradigm shifting, generally the standards and utility of the [[scientific method]] have tended to ensure, to some degree, that scientists agree on some general corpus of [[fact]]s explicated by [[scientific theory]] while rejecting some ideas which run counter to this realization. The concept of scientific consensus is very important to science pedagogy, the evaluation of new ideas, and research funding. Sometimes it is argued that there is a [[closed shop]] [[bias]] within the scientific community toward new ideas. [[Protoscience]], [[fringe science]], and [[pseudoscience]] have been topics that discuss demarcation problems. In response to this some non-consensus claims [[scientific skepticism|skeptical organizations]], not research institutions, have devoted considerable amounts of time and money contesting ideas which run counter to general agreement on a particular topic.

[[Philosophy of science|Philosophers of science]] argue over the [[epistemology|epistemological]] limits of such a consensus and some, including [[Thomas Kuhn]], have pointed to the existence of [[scientific revolution]]s in the [[history of science]] as being an important indication that scientific consensus can, at times, be wrong. Nevertheless, the sheer explanatory power of science in its ability to make [[accuracy|accurate]] and [[Accuracy and precision|precise]] predictions and aid in the design and [[engineering]] of new [[technology]] has ensconced "science" and, by proxy, the opinions of the scientific community as a highly respected form of [[knowledge]] both in the [[academia|academy]] and in [[popular culture]].

===Political controversies===
The high regard with which scientific results are held in Western society has caused a number of [[Politicization of science|political controversies over scientific subjects]] to arise. An alleged [[conflict thesis]] proposed in the 19th century between [[religion and science]] has been cited by some as representative of a struggle between tradition and substantial change and [[faith and reason]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. A popular example used to support this thesis is when [[Galileo]] was tried before the [[Inquisition]] concerning the heliocentric model.&lt;ref&gt;Page 37 John Hedley Brooke: Science and Religion – Some Historical Perspectives, Cambridge 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The persecution began after Pope Urban VIII permitted Galileo to write about the Copernican model. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems" which caused great offense to him.&lt;ref name="Pope Urban VIII"&gt;{{cite web|title=Galileo Project - Pope Urban VIII Biography|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/urban.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though many historians of science have discredited the conflict thesis &lt;ref name="sci rel hist intro"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferngren|first=Gary|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-7038-5|pages=Introduction, p.ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it still remains a popular belief among many including some scientists. In more recent times, the [[creation-evolution controversy]] has resulted in many [[creationism|religious believers in a supernatural creation]] to challenge some [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] assumptions that have been proposed in some of the branches of scientific fields such as [[evolutionary biology]], [[geology]], and [[astronomy]]. Although the dichotomy seems to be of a different outlook from a [[Continental Europe|Continental]] [[Europe]]an perspective, it does exist. The [[Vienna Circle]], for instance, had a paramount (i.e. symbolic) influence on the [[semiotic regime]] represented by the [[Scientific]] [[Community]] in Europe.

In the decades following [[World War II]], some were convinced that [[nuclear power]] would solve the pending [[energy crisis]] by providing energy at low cost. This advocacy led to the construction of many [[nuclear power plants]], but was also accompanied by a global political movement opposed to nuclear power due to safety concerns and associations of the technology with [[nuclear weapons]]. Mass protests in the United States and Europe during the 1970s and 1980s along with the disasters of [[Chernobyl]] and [[Three Mile Island]] led to a decline in nuclear power plant construction.

In the last decades or so, both [[Global warming controversy|global warming]] and [[stem cell controversy|stem cells]] have placed the opinions of the scientific community in the forefront of political debate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20814">[[File:Aberdour Castle -17th century painted ceiling.jpg|thumb|300px|The 17th-century painted ceiling at [[Aberdour Castle]], Fife]]
'''Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings''' are decorated ceilings in Scottish houses and [[Scottish castles|castles]] built between 1540 and 1640. This is a distinctive national style, though there is common ground with similar work elsewhere, especially in [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;See Palau de l'Almirall [[Valencia, Spain]] and later examples at Saint Cornely Church, [[Carnac]] Brittany and Peter und Paul Kirche [[Köngen]].&lt;/ref&gt; An example in England, at [[Wickham, Hampshire|Wickham]], [[Hampshire]], was recorded in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Chinnery, Victor, ''Oak Furniture'', Antique Collector's Club (1979), p.36, pictured: Lewis, Elizabeth, 'A jettied house at Wickham', in ''Proceedings of the Hampshire Field Club'', no.36 (1979/1980), pp.203-215: associated wall-painting is exposed in Wickham Wine Bar, the ceiling is now concealed, [[Sites and Monuments Record|SMR]] no.MWC4723.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most surviving examples are painted simply on the boards and joists forming the floor of the room above. Rooms or galleries in attic storeys were fully lined with thin pine boarding and painted.  The fashion was superseded by decorative plasterwork and sometimes the painted ceilings were broken up to form lathing for the new plaster.

==Paint and painters==
[[File:16th C Painted Beam Ceiling MacMoran's House, Riddle's Court, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|Ceiling with cherub's heads and an Imperial eagle and thistle motif at [[Riddle's Court]]]]
The paint used employed protein [[Sizing|size]] with chalk and pigments, including [[Ochre|natural ochres]], [[vermilion]], and [[orpiment]] often mixed with [[indigo]] to form vibrant greens.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Moses, ed., ''Building Scotland'', John Donald (2010), 92, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pine timber was imported from [[Norway]]. The names of many painters have been found in contemporary records, but as yet no painter of any particular surviving ceiling has been identified through archival research.  However, it is recorded that in 1554, Edinburgh painters led by Walter Binning assaulted an outsider, David Warkman, who had been painting a ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;''Extracts from the records of the Burgh of Edinburgh 1528 - 1557'', 194-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Warkman family were settled at [[Burntisland]] in [[Fife, Scotland|Fife]] the 1590s.&lt;ref&gt;Apted, 'Mary Somerville's House', in ''PSAS'', (1974), p.228&lt;/ref&gt; The Skelmorlie Aisle at Largs was signed by John Stalker, and initials "IM" painted at [[Delgatie Castle]] may be those of the painter John Mellin or Melville.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Ailsa, ''eConservation Magazine'', 10, (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that only the wealthiest of the merchant classes and aristocrats could afford this decoration, though the picture is unbalanced as more modest interiors do not survive.

==Types of patterns==
The largest group of these ceilings have patterns of fruit and flowers, and may perhaps have evoked tapestry borders.  Some ceilings in [[Long gallery|galleries]] at the top of buildings incorporated [[wikt:vignette|vignette]]s with biblical or [[emblem]]atic scenes. Others employ [[Renaissance]] [[grotesque]] ornament including symbolic emblems.  A gallery in a demolished building on Edinburgh's [[Royal Mile#Castle Esplanade and Castlehill|Castlehill]] had scenes of the [[Apocalypse]] and ''Christ asleep in a storm'', set in the [[Firth of Forth]], with a backdrop of the Edinburgh [[Royal Mile]] skyline viewed from Fife.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (1891), 194-201&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments survive in storage at the [[National Museums of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Bath (2003), 239-241&lt;/ref&gt; Ceilings painted with rows of heraldic shields included; the gallery at [[Earlshall Castle]] and [[Collairnie Castle]], [[Fife, Scotland|Fife]], a ceiling at [[Linlithgow]] High Street,&lt;ref&gt;Cook (1868), 409-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[White Castle, East Lothian|Nunraw House]], [[East Lothian]].
[[File:Deathbed Scene. St Mary's, Grandtully - geograph.org.uk - 34798.jpg|thumb|left|Death bed scene from the ceiling of St. Mary's, [[Grandtully]]]]
Several surviving examples can be seen in [[Edinburgh]]; including [[John Knox's House]], [[Gladstone's Land]], and the [[The People's Story Museum|Canongate Tolbooth museum]]. The birthroom at [[Edinburgh Castle]] was painted by James Anderson to commemorate the fiftieth birthday of [[James VI]], and restored by Walter Melville in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Moses, ed., ''Building Scotland'', John Donald (2010), 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladstone's Land dating from 1619 also has relatively well preserved decoration on plaster contemporary with the ceiling. More extensive domestic mural painting survives at [[Kinneil House]], dating from the 1550s, and painted for the [[James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault|Regent Arran]], who employed Walter Binning on some of his projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_075/75_184_204.pdf JS Richardson, 'Mural Decorations at Kinneil,',''PSAS'', vol. 75, (1940–41), 184-204]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aberdour Castle]], Fife, has one of latest ceilings c.1633, and [[Huntingtower Castle]] the earliest c.1540. Ceilings at [[Crathes Castle]] are decorated with the [[Nine Worthies]] and the [[Muses]]. As at Crathes, beams at [[Traquair House]] and Sailor's Walk, Kirkcaldy, carry proverbial and biblical admonitions, written in [[Middle Scots]]. A gallery at [[Provost Skene]]'s House, Aberdeen, is similar in format to the Castlehill painting,&lt;ref&gt;Meldrum, (1958/9)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grandtully|St. Mary's, Grandtully]], and the [[Skelmorlie Aisle]] at [[Largs]], two examples in churches, are painted on the thin lining boards of wooden barrel vaults. [[Culross Palace]], built by Sir [[George Bruce of Carnock]], has a variety of painted interiors including suites of emblems, geometric patterns and biblical scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Jervise, Andrew, (1854)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ceilings remain in private buildings, and a number of ceilings were salvaged and stored by [[Historic Scotland]] including two from [[Dysart, Fife]]. The National Museum of Scotland displays a ceiling from [[Rossend Castle]] Burntisland, Fife,&lt;ref&gt;Apted (1971/2): Thomson (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and a screen from Wester Livilands, near Stirling.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1898/9)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stirling Smith Museum and Art Gallery]] has a ceiling from [[Robert Drummond of Carnock]]'s house. A room from [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline]]'s [[Pinkie House]] is displayed at [[Museum of Edinburgh|Edinburgh's Huntly House Museum]]. Painted beams from [[Midhope Castle]] were moved to [[Royal Mile#Abbey Strand|Abbey Strand]] Edinburgh, and a ceiling from [[Prestongrange House]] is at [[Merchiston Tower]] though these last two are not regularly open to the public.  Two rooms in the [[Missoni#Brands|Hotel Missoni]] in Edinburgh still have painted ceilings from the original early seventeenth century [[tenement]] building on the [[Lawnmarket]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Crone &amp; D. Sproat, 'Revealing the History, timber framed building at No 302 Lawnmarket Edinburgh' in ''Journal of Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland'', 22 (EUP 2012) pp. 19-36&lt;/ref&gt;  Painted ceilings concealed by later plasterwork continue to be discovered. A ceiling with grotesques and scrollwork "of exceptional quality" was found at [[Moubray House]] on Edinburgh's Royal Mile in 1999. After restoration the whole building was pledged as a gift to [[Historic Scotland]] by an American benefactor in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Bath (2003), p.245: [http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/american-aircraft-millionaire-donates-historic-royal-mile-property-to-nation-1-2486920 ''Scotsman Newspaper'', Lifestyle, 24 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another ceiling on Edinburgh's Royal Mile was discovered in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Shân Ross, {{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/Builders-uncover-rare-slice-of.6487770.jp?articlepage=1 |title=Scotsman on Sunday newspaper, 22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of the designs==
[[File:Painted ceiling from Rossend Castle.JPG|thumb|Ceiling from [[Rossend Castle]], [[Burntisland]], in the [[National Museum of Scotland]], painted for [[Robert Melville, 1st Lord Melville|Sir Robert Melville of Murdocairney]] with emblems taken from Claude Paradin]]
Some of the ceilings include pictures or [[emblemata|emblems based on European printed books]]. Prestongrange's ceiling has comic figures from [[Richard Breton]]'s ''Les songes drolatiques de Pantagruel'', Paris (1565).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songesdrolatiques.fr/ |title=Les songes drolatiques de Pantagruel}} (1565).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ornament came from 17 engravings after [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]] called the ''Grottesco'', printed by [[Gerard de Jode]] in [[Antwerp]] (1565–71), and another set the ''Caryatidum'' depicting architectural 'terms' - load bearing figures. The ceiling is dated 1581 and at that time complimented a [[sideboard]] gifted by [[Esmé Stuart, 1st Duke of Lennox|Esmé Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Margaret H.B., ''A Kindly Place'', Tuckwell (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; At Rossend, (now in the National Museum) emblems by Claude Paradin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/ French Emblems at Glasgow] - two editions of Paradin are available here.&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriele Simeoni and [[Alciato]] were used, again with ornamental detail from Vredeman de Vries's ''Grottesco'', with devices of European princes. A ceiling at [[John MacMorran|Riddle's Court]] in Edinburgh has the [[Flags of the Holy Roman Empire|eagle]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] combined with a thistle, perhaps to commemorate the visit of the [[Ulrik of Denmark (1578–1624)|Duke of Holstein]] in 1598.&lt;ref&gt;M. Pearce, 'Riddle's Court', in ''History Scotland Magazine'', vol.12 no.4 (July/August 2012), pp. 20-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Emblems at Culross Palace were adapted from ''A Choice of Emblems'' by [[Geoffrey Whitney|Geffrey Whitney]], London (1586). The tiny engravings made by the French goldsmith [[Etienne Delaune]] supplied the ornament at the Skelmorlie Aisle. Amongst the sources used at Pinkie were de Vries's ''Perspectiva'', (1605), [[Otto van Veen|Otto van Veen's]] ''Emblemata Horatiana'', Antwerp (1607), and Denis de Lebey de Batilly's ''Emblemata'', Frankfurt (1596). These demonstrate the use of renaissance pattern books by painters and patrons in Scotland, and coupled with copious classical quotations, the wealth and topicality of the library of Alexander Seton.&lt;ref&gt;Bath (2003), 79-103, 231, 236, 249-252, 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical literature==

There are no contemporary references to this type of decoration.  Most examples were concealed behind later interiors or neglected in buildings which became lower status accommodation.  In the early nineteenth century antiquarian interest was kindled by discovery during the demolition of buildings in Edinburgh and Dundee. [[Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe]] and Rev. Sime rescued a part of the ''Apocalypse'' painting from Edinburgh's Castlehill and made a series of coloured record drawings now held by the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland|Royal Commission (RCAHMS)]]. Daniel Wilson described the ceiling at length in his ''Memorials of Edinburgh''. At the end of the century, Andrew Lyons, artist and antiquarian, made drawings of a number of ceilings (also in RCAHMS), and published articles in the ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries, Scotland, PSAS.''

In the first half of twentieth century conservation works were led by John Houston of the Ministry of Works.  Ian Hodkinson, a [[Conservator (museum)|conservator]], and Michael R Apted, an [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979|inspector of ancient monuments]], were instrumental in the rescue and salvage of a number of painted ceilings, published in Apted's 1966 monograph, and a series of ''PSAS'' articles. Apted made an exhaustive search of archive references to painting for his Edinburgh PhD, and this formed the basis for his collaboration with Susan Hannabuss on ''Painters in Scotland: A Biographical Dictionary'' published in 1978. John Cornforth admired the contribution of the Stenhouse Conservation Centre as antiquarian and romantic.&lt;ref&gt;Cornforth (1994), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Michael Bath, emeritus professor of English, [[Strathclyde University]], has re-assessed the corpus with a particular focus on the emblems used and their origins and meanings to the Scottish patrons. Bath has published a number of articles and a detailed illustrated 2003 monograph exploring sources with a useful comprehensive inventory of examples both extant and destroyed. Ailsa Murray's 2009 article and Chantal‐Helen Thuer's 2011 report explore conservation methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8239">The imitation of [[natural sounds]] in various cultures is a diverse phenomenon and can fill in various functions. In several instances, it is related to the belief system ([[yoik]]s of the [[Sami people|Sami]],&lt;ref name=shamyoik&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 56, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spell&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ykt&gt;[http://www.uit.no/ssweb/dok/Somby/Ande/95.htm Somby 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080325110925/http://www.uit.no/ssweb/dok/Somby/Ande/95.htm |date=2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yoikbel&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 74&lt;/ref&gt; some other shamanic songs and rituals,&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=calf&gt;Hoppál 2005: 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bear&gt;[http://haldjas.folklore.ee/~aado/tent.htm Lintrop]&lt;/ref&gt; [[overtone singing]] of some cultures). It may serve also such practical goals as luring in the hunt;&lt;ref name=natt/&gt; or entertainment ([[katajjaq]]s of [[Inuit]]).&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;&lt;ref name=desch/&gt;

Among some peoples of the [[Altai-Sayan region]], including [[Tofalar|Tofa]], the ability to mimic sounds of the environment includes hunting calls, and is present also in a traditional singing tradition preserved only by some old people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Song ond sound mimesis|publisher=Foundation for Endangered Languages |url=http://www.ogmios.org/164.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shamanism ===
{{Main|Imitation of sounds in shamanism}}
[[Shamanism]] in various cultures shows great diversity.&lt;ref name=div&gt;Hoppál 2005: 15&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, the music or songs related to shamanistic practice may mimic natural sounds, sometimes with [[onomatopoiea]].&lt;ref name=onom&gt;[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf  Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entertainment ===

The intention to mimic natural sounds is not necessarily linked to shamanistic beliefs or practice alone. [[Katajjaq]] (a "genre" of [[Inuit music|music of some Inuit groups]]) is a game played by women, for entertainment. In some instances, [[natural sounds]] (mostly those of animals, e.g. geese) are imitated.&lt;ref name=natt&gt;Nattiez: 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desch&gt;[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm Deschênes 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luring animals ===

The kind of [[katajjaq]] mentioned above, which mimics the cry of geese, shows some similarities with the practice of the hunters to lure game.&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;

Some Eskimo peoples used a tool (shaped like a claw) to scratch the ice of the frozen sea in order to attract seals.&lt;ref&gt;Burch &amp; Forman 1988: 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birket-Smith 1969: 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Ja'fari principles ({{lang-fa|علم اصول در مکتب جعفری}}) refers to regulations, history and eminent persons and scholars during the development of shia's [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence]].

==History and development==
===Imami jurists and early works===
Considering different stances in relation to Juridical rules and principles, there are some parties in the schools of Principles. These schools try to apply analytical approaches in their methodology. There are somebodies such as Zorarah Ibn Aayon, Muhammad Ibn Moslem, Abu Basir and also Hisham Ibn Salem.Among these individuals, Hisham Ibn Salem and His Pupils had eminent roles in development of principles among shia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/9844&lt;/ref&gt; In this period two problems are so important such as difference of hadith in one hand and the distinctions of Ijtihad or authority in other hand.There are two early scholars in principles of jurisprudence who were eminent including [[Hisham ibn Hakam]] and Yunes Ibn Abd Al Rahman.some scholars know Hisham ibn hakam and hisham ibn salem among the outstanding pupils of Imam Sadiq and Imam Kazim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhammad Mansour Hashemi|Tashbih and tanzih|Daneshnameh Jahan Islami in Pesian|vol=1|p=3554|cite book=http://lib.eshia.ir/23019/1/3554/%D9%87%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%85_%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86_%D8%AD%DA%A9%D9%85}}&lt;/ref&gt; they wrote important books in the field of principles of jurisprudence such as "Kitab Al Akhbar" and " Kayfa Taseh" or "How it is correct?"

===Period of establishment===
It seems that the dominant current was the Adherents of Hadith during the fourth century of Lunar hijrah. They didn't any need to knowledge of principles and put it away.In other hand the relatives of Nobakhti begun a new movement in the sphere of theology and [[kalam]] among shia and Imamiyyah.Abu Sahl Nobakhti, the popular theologian of Shia schools, could presented a new and complete theological system along with Shia characters.In Fact Abu Sahl Nobakhti concerned with the principles through the theological works such a way that He referred to some questions in the field of the principles.According to Madlung this approach of Abu Sahl Nobakhti and his theological system was along with defending of Imami creeds and theological beliefs.Maybe the most important Abu Sahl's essay in the principles is the essay of "Naqz Al Shafe'ei or the refusing the shafe'ei which is written against Shafe'ei and also counted as the first completed work in the principles among imamiyyah.besided he written some books on the subjects of refusing Qyias in jurisprudence and ijtihad Al R'ay.Of course there is no track from these works and they are lost.During the fourth century of Hijrah, already one trend is very dominant which is indeed on the basis of refusing of Qiyas and R'ay in jurisprudence. Also there were many books concerned with these subjects among imami Theologians. for example Hasan ibn Mousa Nobakhti wrote a book by the name of "A book on the khabar Vahed and Amal".according to this works there is no appication for Qiyas and R'ay.Among The first Mutakalim Jurist in fourth century is Ibn Abi Aqil Ammani as some one who possessed a school which his method was similar to Twelve Imams of Shia and somehow like the Mutazilite schools of thought.

====Ibn Abi Aqil And his thought====
His complete name was Ibn Abi Aqil Ammani and he came from the [[Yemen]]. He was contemporary with Shaykh Koleini.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jafar sobhani|Al Vasit fi Feqh|vol=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Aqil counted as pioneer jurist in the principles. He could establishing an approach on which His juridical methodology was dependent on Quranic rules and known traditions.He is the author of a legal work entitled Mutamassak bi Habl Al Rasul, which was one of the most renowned legal sources during the 4th and 5thllOth and 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Modarrsei TabaTabaei|1984|p=35|introduction to shi'i law}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the first one who arrange the knowledge of [[fiqh]] and give consistency ti it.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.eshia.ir/10257/15/6/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86_%D8%B9%D9%82%DB%8C%D9%84_%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ibn Jonayd Eskafi====
[[Ibn Jonayd Eskafi]]  was one of the first and eminent Shia jurists during the fourth century lunar hijrah.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/1513&lt;/ref&gt; He had different approach in understanding of Shia's traditions. He believed that there is a theological basis for interpretation of Hadith on which the Juridical tradition of Imams is not according to Saying but to Ray or opinion.He was an eminent religious scholars among elites.Also Ibn Nadim knows him as great scholars among shia.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.eshia.ir/10242/27/200&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most important book in Fiqh is Tahzib Al Shia le Ahkam Al Shariah.&lt;ref&gt;http://lib.eshia.ir/10242/27/207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period of development===
Needness to Usul becomes indispensable when Shia community far away from twelve periods. Also appearance of new subjects intensify this necessity.in development epoch we confronted with three eminent masters in the field of Usul and extending it namely [[Shaykh Mufid]], [[Sharif Murtaza]], [[Sallar Deylami]] and [[Shaykh Tusi]].

====Shaykh Mufid====
{{main article|Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid}}
He was also called Ibn Muallim, meaning "son of the teacher";&lt;ref name="Glassé1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glassé|first=Cyril|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlPuAAAAMAAJ|year=1991|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|isbn=978-0-06-063126-0|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muallim was his father.

According to [[Ibn al-Nadim]], who knew al-Mufid personally, he was the head of the Shia ''Mutekallimun'' in the field of kalam, and [[Abū Hayyān al-Tawhīdī|al-Tawhidi]], who was also personally familiar with al-Mufid, described him as "eloquent and skillful at dialectic (''jadal'')". His skill in polemical debate was such that he was said to be capable of convincing his opponents "that a wooden column was actually gold".&lt;ref name="Kraemer1992" /&gt; He was taught the Islamic science of [[hadith]] by [[Ibn Babawayh|Al-Shaykh al-Saduq]].&lt;ref name="Christoph" /&gt;

The house of al-Shaikh al-Tusi was burnt down, as were his books and the works he had written in Baghdad, together with important libraries of Shi'ite books. Al-Tusi went to al-Najaf after the fall of Baghdad. He died at Najaf on the 22nd of Muharram in the year 460 A.H/2 December 1067.in confliction between two schools of Ahbaris and usuli, Shaykh Tusi defended of Usuli school and calls akhbari as followers of literate or literalists.&lt;ref name=Clifford1989&gt;{{harvnb| Clifford Edmund Bosworth|Brill Archive, 1989|The Encyclopedia of Islam, Volume 6|p=549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaykh Tusi believed in principles of jurisprudence as a fundamental knowledge in acquiring the judgments of Islam religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition: Supplement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=95Q3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA56|date=1 January 1980|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=90-04-06167-3|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote in introduction of 'Al-Iddah' book as follow:
" thus you may say, it is essential to attach the greatest importance to this branch of knowledge( namely Usul) because the whole of shariah is based on it and the knowledge of the any aspect thereof is not complete without mastering the principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Alsyyed Abu Mohammad Naqvi|title=Shia Dissociation from Usuli School|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dmVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145|date=12 December 2013|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4918-8644-1|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also he tries to compare different schools of law in Islam with each other and show there is a little divergence between them and they are near to each other and differences among them is in minor subject not major.&lt;ref name=Subhani2001&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jaʻfar Subḥānī|author2=Reze Shah-Kazemi|title=The Doctrines of Shi'ism: A Compendium of Imami Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6h2UnIaoioQC&amp;pg=PA181|date=7 December 2001|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-780-2|pages=181–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaykh Tusi, like his Masters, refuted the legal analogy(Qiyyas Fiqhi) in his manual of usul Fiqh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dewin Stewart in weiss|Muhammad b.

===Period of flourishing===
this period begans from the end of Sixth into middle of eighth lunar hijrah.Scholars written many detailed books in the fielf of principles.They concerned with principles in detail and accuracy.Scholars such as Ibn Zohreh halabi,Sadid Al Din Hemsi,Najm Al Din Helli,Allameh Helli,Amid Al Din A'araji,Zia Al Din A'araji,Fakhr Al Mohaqeqin, Muhammad Ibn Makki known as first martyr,Shaykh Abdullah Soyouri,Zain Al DIn Ibn Nour Al Din Ali Ibn Ahmad known A Second Martyr, all of them lived in this period.

====Allameh Helli====
{{main article|Al-Hilli}}
Al-Hilli also known as the sage of Hilla,&lt;ref name="jafri"&gt;Jafri, S.H.M. "al- Ḥillī , (1) Ḏj̲amāl al-Dīn Ḥasan b. Yūsuf b. ʿAlī b. Muṭahhar." [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-2867 Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition.] Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E. Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Brill Online. Augustana. 13 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was born in the still existent town of [[Al Hillah]] (in what is now [[Iraq]]), commonly viewed as the [[Shi'a Islam in Iraq|centre of Shia Islam]] when [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] leaders were in control over [[Baghdad]] during his life.&lt;ref name="jafri"/&gt; He entered into a prominent family of [[Ulama|Shia jurists]] and theologians. His father, Sadid ul-Din al-Hilli, was a respected ''mujtahid'' and a leading figure in the Shia community. His maternal uncle [[Muhaqqiq al-Hilli]] was also a renowned scholar.He studied [[Islamic theology|theology]] and [[fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) in Hilla under the auspices of his father and his uncle, as well as other notable scholars, including: Ali bin Tawus and Ahmad bin Tawus.&lt;ref name="tehrani"&gt;Tehrani, Aga Buzurg, Tabaqat 'Alam il-Shi'ah, v.5 p.52 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent some time at the newly established [[Maragheh observatory]], where he studied [[Avicennism|Avicennan]] [[philosophy]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]] under [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], and was also introduced to the works of [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]]. Later, he travelled to Baghdad and became acquainted with the doctrines of [[Ibn Arabi]].&lt;ref name="Schmidkte"&gt;Schmidkte, S. ḤELLI, ḤASAN B. YUSOF B. MOṬAHHAR. Encyclopaedia Iranica (www.iranicaonline.org, accessed: 28.09.09)&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Hilli's role in shaping Twelver [[jurisprudence]] is of great importance. As well as several works and commentaries on [[usul al-fiqh]], he produced a voluminous legal corpus. Of this, two of the most important works are ''al-Mukhtalaf'' (''The Disagreement'') and ''al-Muntaha'' (''The End''). ''Mukhtalaf'' is a legal manual devoted to addressing legal questions in which the Shia jurists hold differing opinions, whereas the ''Muntaha'' is a systematic and detailed exposition of al-Hilli's own legal opinions. He also wrote a summarized legal manual, ''Qawa'id ul-Ahkam'', which was popular amongst later scholars, judging by the number of commentaries that would be written on it. Amongst his later legal works is ''Tadhkirat ul-Fuqaha'', which is a legal manual intended for use by lay persons. He also composed legal works on specific issues (for example, ''[[Hajj]]'' or ''[[Salat]]'').&lt;ref name="Schmidkte"/&gt;

====Fakhr Al Muhaqeqin====
Muhaqqiq was born in the city of [[al-Hilla]], [[Iraq]], where he would spend most of his life, to a family of prominent Shi'i jurists. He studied [[theology]], [[fiqh]] and [[usul al-fiqh]] under his father. Muhaqqiq later became the leader of the Shi'i seminary there.He has many credible books in principles like Mabadi Al Osul,Fakhryyah and others.

====First martyr====
{{main article|Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili}}
Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili al-[[Jezzine|Jizzini]]&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Phyllis G. Jestice|title=Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia, Volume 1|date=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576073551|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1334–1385) also known as '''Shahid Awwal''' (Arabic: الشهيد الأول''ash-Shahid al-Awwal''  "The First Martyr"), is the author of Al-Lum'ah ad-Dimashqiya (Arabic: الدمشقية اللمعة, The Damascene Glitter") and was a [[Shi'a]] scholar. Although he is neither the first Muslim, nor the first Shi'te to die for his religion, he became known as "Shahid Awwal" because he was probably the first Shia scholar of such stature to have been killed in a brutal manner.When Mohammad bin Makki was 16 years old he went to study at al-[[Hilla]] in Iraq. He returned home when he was 21. He used [[taqiyya]] to establish himself as one of the religious scholars of Damascus, using Sunni law to judge Sunnis, while covertly judging the Shia using Shia law.&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO"/&gt;

====Second martyr====
{{main article|Zayn al-Din al-Juba'i al'Amili}}
Zayn al-Din al-Juba'i al'Amili (1506-1558) was a [[Shia Islam|Shia]] scholar. He was born in 911 AH. in Jabal Amel.His Magnum opus is the first commentary of ''The Damascene Glitter'' by [[Shahid Awwal]] called ''The Beautiful Garden in Interpreting the Damscene Glitter'' (Arabic: ''ar-Rawda-l-Bahiyah fi Sharh allam'a-d-Dimashqiya''   الروضة البهيّة في شرح اللمعة الدمشقيّة ).

===Period of Decline===
The appearance of Akhbari lies in this period.This school  "crystalized" as a distinct movement with the writings of [[Muhammad Amin al-Astarabadi]] (d. 1627 AD) and achieved its greatest influence in the late [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and early post-Safavid era.  However, shortly thereafter [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]] (d. 1792), along with other Usuli [[mujtahid]]s, crushed the Akhbari movement.&lt;ref name="momen222"&gt;{{Citation| last =Momen| first =Moojan| author-link =

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akhbārī ideology is that nothing but the aḥadīth of the Infallible can serve as authoritative evidence in Islam. Akhbārīs also differ from Usūlīs in their rejection of the ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists]]'', arguing that preachers of religion have no role in politics,  clerics should advise political leaders but not govern themselves. Akhbaris believe in separation of religion and state in absence of Twelfth Imam, they say that only an infallible ruling Imam has a right to combine religion and state; and which will be accomplished only after the arrival of awaited Shia Imam.

====Against akhbarism====
*According to the [[Akhbari]] view, the only sources of law are the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]], and any case not explicitly covered by one of these must be regarded as not having been provided for.
*According to the majority [[Usuli]] view, it is legitimate to seek general principles by induction, in order to provide for cases not expressly provided for.  This process is known as [[ijtihad]], and the [['Aql|intellect]] is recognised as a source of law.  It differs from the Sunni [[qiyas]] in that it does not simply extend existing laws on a test of factual resemblance: it is necessary to formulate a general principle that can be rationally supported.

==Contemporary periods==
[[Javadi Amoli]] wrote about source of revelation in Shiism:
# The most important source in [[Shiite]] law is the [[Quran]] itself, which interprets itself 
# The other source is the tradition of the infallibles (the family of Muhammad), according to the successive tradition (Saqalain) passed down by the family of Muhammad as well as according to the [[Quran]] itself: to accept one without the other is equivalent to rejecting both of them.
# A third source is theoretical wisdom where it is impossible to conceive the contrary, which proves the existence of God and the necessity of his unity, eternity, pre-existence, power, will and other exalted attributes: this cannot be denied with any verse.
# Although we cannot impose science upon the Quran, we can use verified scientific, experimental, historical, artistic, logical and other evidence to interpret the subject addressed in a given passage, rather than through another verse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tasnim]] ([[tafsir]]), Vol 1, Page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In doubtful cases the law is often derived not from substantive principles induced from existing rules, but from procedural presumptions (''usul 'amaliyyah'') concerning factual probability.  An example is the presumption of continuity: if one knows that a given state of affairs, such as ritual purity, existed at some point in the past but one has no evidence one way or the other whether it exists now, one can presume that the situation has not changed.&lt;ref&gt;One can compare, in Western legal systems, the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of possession.  Similarly Catholic moral theology distinguishes between "direct principles" and "reflex principles", the latter being the equivalent of [[Murtada al-Ansari]]'s ''usul 'amaliyyah''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of probability forms a large part of the Shiite science of ''usul al-fiqh'', and was developed by [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]] (1706-1792) and Shaykh [[Murtada al-Ansari]] (died 1864). The only primary text on Shi'ite principles of jurisprudence in English is [[Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr]]'s ''Durus fi 'Ilm al-'Usul''.&lt;ref&gt;This has been translated into English twice: by [[Roy Mottahedeh]] as "Lessons in Islamic Jurisprudence" (2005) {{ISBN|978-1-85168-393-2}} and anonymously as "The Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence according to Shi'i Law" (2003) {{ISBN|978-1-904063-12-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English version==
Uşūl al-Fiqh, the [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|methodology of jurisprudence]], which is usually – and inaccurately, if not incorrectly – translated “principles of jurisprudence,” is an Islamic science which is developed by Shiite scholars in two recent centuries into an unparalleled intellectual, logical system of thought and a comprehensive branch of knowledge which not only serves as the logic of jurisprudence but as an independent science dealing with some hermeneutical problems.

Lack of precise English equivalents to expressions and terms of this complicated science indicates the least difficulties of preparing the first English version of Shiite uşūl al-fiqh.

"[http://bayanbox.ir/download/6126480921220660060/USUL-AL-FIQH.pdf An Introduction to Methodology of Islamic Jurisprudence (Uşūl al-Fiqh)-A Shiite Approach]" is the first English version of Shiite uşūl al-fiqh.[http://www.lib.ir/book/60869565/An-introduction-to-methodology-of-Islamic-Jurispru/]

This book is written by Alireza Hodaee, Professor of [[Fiqh|Jurisprudence]] and the Essentials of Islamic Law, University of Tehran.[http://usuli.ir/2016/07/04/usul-al-fiqh/]

It should be noted that most of complicated arguments of such profound science cannot be presented in an introductory work; they should be pursued in detailed books written by great Shiite Uşūlīs.

==History==
Warwick's School of Industrial and Business Studies (SIBS) was founded in 1967, with Brian Houlden as Chair, a total of five academic staff and 24 students across three programmes (MSc Management &amp; Business Studies, MSc Management Science &amp; Operational Research, Doctoral programme). It quickly gained a reputation for excellent research, particularly in the field of [[industrial relations]]. The Industrial Relations Research Unit, founded by [[Hugh Clegg (industrial relations)|Hugh Clegg]] in 1970 focused on achieving a better understanding of workplace industrial relations in general and workplace trade unionism in particular, in a time when the UK was perceived to suffer greatly from industrial strife and poor economic performance.

In 1981, the MSc in Management was renamed the Warwick MBA. At its 20th anniversary in 1987, SIBS was renamed Warwick Business School. The department had grown to over 100 staff, 815 students and 11 programs. In 1997, following expansion of the distance learning MBA in particular, the staff tally was over 260, with 3,160 students across 17 programs.

In 2000, a new Executive MBA teaching centre was opened, the first of four phases of development of new premises for WBS. Further phases opened in 2001 and 2006, increasing the teaching capacity of WBS dramatically. This was followed by aggressive recruitment of academic faculty. In 2006, there were a total of 319 staff and 7,539 students across 25 degree programs, from over 100 countries worldwide.

In September 2014, WBS opened a second campus in [[The Shard]] Tower in [[London]] to teach its MSc Finance, MSc Human Resource Management and Employment Relations along with its Executive MBA courses.&lt;ref name="ft.com"/&gt;

In August 2015, WBS opened Phase 3b of its Scarman Road building on The University of Warwick campus. The £30m extension &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbs.ac.uk/news/interior-of-30m-wbs-extension-revealed/.html Interior of £30m WBS extension revealed]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; houses a 292-seat lecture theatre with a removable stage, a 120-seat lecture theatre which contains swivel chairs to allow for group work, a Behavioural Science Laboratory, a 150-seater café, nine seminar rooms, undergraduate and post-graduate learning spaces and four open plan offices for management and support staff plus a new reception.

Each teaching subject group has a group convenor or head, and devolved group management. Each research centre has a director, and has similarly devolved management. Research centres may have a board with external representation to ensure practical relevance of research strategy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2984">The '''Welsh Agricultural College''' (WAC) was established in Aberystwyth, Wales in 1970. In 1995 it merged with [[Aberystwyth University]].

==Establishment==
In an unusual arrangement, the College was financed through a joint committee composed of representatives of all the Welsh local authorities. Its original mission in 1970 was to provide vocational education in agriculture (NDA and HND) and for a number of years it provided National and Higher National Diploma courses. An HND took 4 years and included extensive work experience on farms. 

It shared a campus with the Welsh College of Librarianship at Llanbadarn. The first intake of 34 tudents was in 1971, when the buildings were unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/local-news/tortuous-beginnings-welsh-agricultural-college-2685988&lt;/ref&gt; The College acquired Frondeg dairy farm and a beef and sheep unit at Tan y Graig.

Dr DW Dai Morris was the first Principal. 

==Degrees and students==
WAC later diversified its provision to include courses in Countryside Management and Equine Studies.  A degree scheme in Agriculture, offered jointly with the University of Wales Aberystwyth’s Department of Agricultural Sciences, was established in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/university/history/timelinepart3/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Student from this period were typically UK applicants who wanted an applied course, or had not gained places at more established agricultural colleges ([[Wye College]], [[Royal Agricultural College]] in Cirencester, [[Harper_Adams_University |Harper Adams College]] etc.). Some were sons or daughters of Welsh farmers. 

The College had a small contingent of young lecturing staff (Professor Wynne Jones OBE 1970s-1988, latterly Principal of [[Harper_Adams_University | Harper Adams College]]; Dr John Harries 1974-1995, former Principal of WAC and Pro-Vice Chancellor of [[Aberystwyth University]]).

==Disestablishment and merger==
In 1995 the Welsh Agricultural College merged with the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]]'s Department of Agricultural Sciences to form its Institute of Rural Studies, with Michael Haines appointed as its first Director. 

It was later renamed the Institute of Rural Sciences. In 2008 it was merged with the university's Institute of Biological Sciences and the independent Institute of Grassland and Environmental Sciences (IGER)to form the [[Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences]] (IBERS).
