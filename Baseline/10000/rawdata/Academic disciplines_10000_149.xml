'''AgroParisTech''' (officially [[French language|French]] ''Institut des sciences et industries du vivant et de l'environnement'', or ''Paris Institute of Technology for Life, Food and Environmental Sciences'')&lt;ref&gt;English naming according to [http://www.agroparistech.fr/IMG/pdf/AgroParisTech_brochure_ENGLISH.pdf English brochure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209013409/http://www.agroparistech.fr/IMG/pdf/AgroParisTech_brochure_ENGLISH.pdf |date=2008-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a French university-level institution, also known as a "[[Grande Ecole]]". It was founded on January 1, 2007, by the merger of three life sciences [[grandes écoles]].

Leader in life sciences and agronomy, AgroParisTech is one of the foremost and most prestigious Grandes Ecoles. AgroParisTech is one of the founding members of the [[Université Paris-Saclay]], which will be the largest European multidisciplinary campus. AgroParisTech will consequently be moving to the [[Paris-Saclay]] [[business cluster| business]] and [[research-intensive cluster| research-intensive]] cluster in 2018.

AgroParisTech is a member of the [[UniverSud Paris]] and the [[Paris Institute of Technology]] (or Paris Tech). The latter is a consortium of ten graduate institutes of science and engineering. AgroParisTech is also part of 'The Life and Environmental Science and Technology Hub' of the [[Paris]] region, together with [[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique|INRA]], [[Cemagref]], [[AFSSA]], the [[Ecole nationale vétérinaire d'Alfort]], and the [[Versailles National School of Landscape architecture]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}


== History==
AgroParisTech is the merger of three graduate institutes of science and engineering located around [[Paris]]:
* ''[[Institut National Agronomique Paris-Grignon|Institut national agronomique Paris-Grignon]]'' (INA P-G), founded in 1826
* [[French National School of Forestry|''École nationale du génie rural, des eaux et des forêts'']] (ENGREF), founded in 1964
* ''[[École Nationale Supérieure des Industries Agricoles et Alimentaires|École nationale supérieure des industries agricoles et alimentaires]]'' (ENSIA), founded in 1893.

The public higher education system in France includes universities and other institutions called the “[[Grandes Ecoles]]”. The “Grandes Ecoles” are the best rated pathways for higher education in Engineering and Management. The vast majority of the chief executives in major French companies and of top managers in the French Administration are graduates from the “Grandes Ecoles”. The features are:
* A very selective admission process through which students are either admitted by a nationwide entrance exam (notably after two or three years of “[[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|prépas]]”) or by the virtue of excellent academic records;
* 5 years (Master’s degrees) to 8 years (PhD and post-Master’s degrees) of higher education;
* The degree course at the “Grandes Ecoles” includes compulsory internships in laboratories and companies, in France or abroad
* The prestige of the “Grandes Ecoles” and  contacts with major enterprises provide an easy access to the job market.

==Organization==
AgroParisTech is organized into five departments:
* Agronomy, Forestry, Water and Environmental Science and Technology,
* Life Science and Health,
* Science and Engineering for Food and Bioproducts,
* Social science, Economics and Management,
* Modeling: Mathematics, Informatics and Physics

==Academic programs==
AgroParisTech offers different Masters:
* 3 different Masters of Engineering (MEng):
** [[Agronomy]]
** Food Science and Engineering
** Forestry
* 2 Masters of Science (MSc)
* 1 Master's program with 5 domains that cover most fields of Life Science and Technology
* one of 7 partner universities in the Master of Science in European Forestry program

It also offers:
* a wide range of Ph.D. programs.
* 1 Post-Master's degree for Management and Administration in environmental sciences and policies, proposed by [[ENGREF]], a post-graduate institute of [[AgroParisTech]].
* 9 Post-master professional certificates (one-year post graduate training)

==Research programmes==
AgroParisTech has:
* 39 research laboratories,
* 300 researchers

==Background==
The concept of the oceanic anoxic event (OAE) was first proposed in 1976 by Seymour Schlanger (1927–1990) and geologist Hugh Jenkyns&lt;ref name="HistOfOil-2"&gt;History Channel, "The History of Oil" (2007), Australian Broadcasting System, Inc.&lt;!--may be out of context --&gt;, aired: 2:00-4:00 pm EDST, 2008-07-08; Note: [[Geologist]] Hugh Jenkyns was interviewed in the History Channel's (re: footnote:3 History Channel, "The History of Oil" (2007)) documentary "The History of Oil" and attributed the matching occurrence high in the [[Apennine Mountains]]' meter thick black shale band put together with the findings from the [[Deep Sea Drilling Project]] as triggering the theory and work that followed from a beginning ca 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; and arose from discoveries made by the [[Deep Sea Drilling Project]] (DSDP) in the Pacific Ocean. It was the finding of black carbon-rich shales in Cretaceous sediments that had accumulated on submarine [[volcanic plateau]]s ([[Shatsky Rise]], [[Manihiki Plateau]]), coupled with the fact that they were identical in age with similar deposits cored from the Atlantic Ocean and known from outcrops in Europe - particularly in the geological record of the otherwise limestone-dominated [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]&lt;ref name="HistOfOil-2"/&gt; chain in Italy - that led to the realization that these widespread similar [[stratigraphy|strata]] recorded highly unusual oxygen-depleted conditions in the world ocean during several discrete periods of [[geological time scale|geological time]].

Sedimentological investigations of these organic-rich sediments, which have continued to this day, typically reveal the presence of fine laminations undisturbed by bottom-dwelling fauna, indicating anoxic conditions on the sea floor, believed to be coincident with a low lying poisonous layer of hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt; Furthermore, detailed organic [[geochemical]] studies have recently revealed the presence of molecules (so-called biomarkers) that derive from both [[purple sulfur bacteria]]&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt; and [[green sulfur bacteria]]: organisms that required both light and free [[hydrogen sulfide|hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S)]], illustrating that anoxic conditions extended high into the illuminated upper water column.

There are currently several places on earth that are exhibiting the features of anoxic events on a localized scale such as algal/bacterial blooms and localized "dead zones". [[Dead zone (ecology)|Dead zones]] exist off the East Coast of the United States in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], in the Scandinavian strait [[Kattegat]], the [[Black Sea]] (which may have been anoxic in its deepest levels for millennia, however), in the northern Adriatic as well as a dead zone off the coast of Louisiana. The current{{When|date=May 2016}} surge of [[jellyfish]] worldwide is sometimes regarded as the first stirrings of an anoxic event{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}. Other marine dead zones have appeared in coastal waters of South America, China, Japan, and [[New Zealand]]. A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080814154325.htm]

This is a recent understanding. This picture was only pieced together during the last three decades{{When|date=May 2016}}. The handful of known and suspected anoxic events have been tied geologically to large-scale production of the world's oil reserves in worldwide bands of black [[shale]] in the [[geologic record]]. Likewise the high relative temperatures believed linked to so called "[[super-greenhouse event]]s".&lt;ref

===Euxinia===
{{See also|Phosphorus cycle}}
Oceanic '''anoxic events''' with [[Euxinia|euxinic]] (i.e. sulfidic) conditions have been linked to extreme episodes of volcanic outgassing. Thus, volcanism contributed to the buildup of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere, increased global temperatures, causing an accelerated hydrological cycle that introduced nutrients to the oceans to stimulate planktonic productivity. These processes potentially acted as a trigger for euxinia in restricted basins where water-column stratification could develop. Under anoxic to euxinic conditions, oceanic phosphate is not retained in sediment and could hence be released and recycled, aiding continued high productivity.&lt;ref name="Kump 2008" /&gt;

Temperatures throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous are generally thought to have been relatively warm, and consequently dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean were lower than today - making anoxia easier to achieve. However, more specific conditions are required to explain the short-period (less than a million years) oceanic anoxic events. Two hypotheses, and variations upon them, have proved most durable.

One hypothesis suggests that the anomalous accumulation of organic matter relates to its enhanced preservation under restricted and poorly oxygenated conditions, which themselves were a function of the particular geometry of the ocean basin: such a hypothesis, although readily applicable to the young and relatively narrow Cretaceous Atlantic (which could be likened to a large-scale Black Sea, only poorly connected to the World Ocean), fails to explain the occurrence of coeval black shales on open-ocean Pacific plateaus and shelf seas around the world.  There are suggestions, again from the Atlantic, that a shift in oceanic circulation was responsible, where warm, salty waters at low latitudes became hypersaline and sank to form an intermediate layer, at {{convert|500|to|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} depth, with a temperature of {{convert|20|C|F|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|25|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ngeo217"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second hypothesis suggests that oceanic anoxic events record a major change in the fertility of the oceans that resulted in an increase in organic-walled plankton (including bacteria) at the expense of calcareous plankton such as [[coccoliths]] and [[foraminifera]].
Such an accelerated flux of organic matter would have expanded and intensified the [[oxygen minimum zone]], further enhancing the amount of organic carbon entering the sedimentary record. Essentially this mechanism assumes a major increase in the availability of dissolved nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and possibly iron to the phytoplankton population living in the illuminated layers of the oceans.

For such an increase to occur would have required an accelerated influx of land-derived nutrients coupled with vigorous [[upwelling]], requiring major climate change on a global scale. Geochemical data from oxygen-[[isotope]] ratios in carbonate sediments and fossils, and magnesium/calcium ratios in fossils, indicate that all major oceanic anoxic events were associated with thermal maxima, making it likely that global weathering rates, and nutrient flux to the oceans, were increased during these intervals.  Indeed, the reduced solubility of oxygen would lead to phosphate release, further nourishing the ocean and fuelling high productivity, hence a high oxygen demand - sustaining the event through a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="10.1146.2Fannurev.earth.36.031207.124256"/&gt;

Here is another way of looking at oceanic anoxic events.  Assume that the earth releases a huge volume of carbon dioxide during an interval of intense volcanism; global temperatures rise due to the [[greenhouse effect]]; global weathering rates and fluvial nutrient flux increase; organic productivity in the oceans increases; organic-[[Carbon sequestration|carbon burial]] in the oceans increases (OAE begins); carbon dioxide is drawn down due to both burial of organic matter and weathering of silicate rocks (inverse greenhouse effect); global temperatures fall, and the ocean–atmosphere system returns to equilibrium (OAE ends).

In this way, an oceanic anoxic event can be viewed as the Earth’s response to the injection of excess carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and [[hydrosphere]].  One test of this notion is to look at the age of [[large igneous province]]s (LIPs), the extrusion of which would presumably have been accompanied by rapid effusion of vast quantities of volcanogenic gases such as carbon dioxide.  Intriguingly, the age of three LIPs ([[Karoo-Ferrar]] flood basalt, [[Caribbean large igneous province]], [[Ontong Java Plateau]]) correlates uncannily well with that of the major [[Jurassic]] (early [[Toarcian]]) and Cretaceous (early [[Aptian extinction|Aptian]] and [[Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event|Cenomanian–Turonian]]) oceanic anoxic events, indicating that a causal link is feasible.

==Occurrence==
Oceanic anoxic events most commonly occurred during periods of very warm [[climate]] characterized by high levels of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and mean surface temperatures probably in excess of {{Convert|25|°C}}. The [[Quaternary]] levels, the current [[period (geology)|period]], are just {{Convert|13|°C}} in comparison. Such rises in carbon dioxide may have been in response to a great outgassing of the highly flammable [[natural gas]] (methane) that some call an "oceanic burp".&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt;&lt;ref

|quote=With extreme weather continuing to bite -- hurricanes may increase in power by half a category above today’s top-level Category Five -- world food supplies will be critically endangered. :And: The Eocene greenhouse event fascinates scientists not just because of its effects, which also saw a major mass-extinction in the seas, but also because of its likely cause: [[methane hydrate]]s. This unlikely substance, a sort of ice-like combination of methane and water that is only stable at low temperatures and high pressure, may have burst into the atmosphere from the seabed in an immense '''“ocean burp”''', sparking a surge in global temperatures (methane is even more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide). Today vast amounts of these same methane hydrates still sit on sub-sea continental shelves. As the oceans warm, they could be released once more in a terrifying echo of that methane belch of 55 million years ago.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vast quantities of [[methane]] are normally locked into the Earth's crust on the continental plateaus in one of the many deposits consisting of compounds of [[methane hydrate]], a solid precipitated combination of methane and water much like ice. Because the methane hydrates are unstable, except at cool temperatures and high (deep) pressures, scientists have observed smaller "burps" due to [[tectonic]] events.

The [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] (PETM), which was characterized by a global rise in temperature and deposition of organic-rich shales in some shelf seas, shows many similarities to oceanic anoxic events.

Typically, oceanic anoxic events lasted for less than a million years, before a full recovery.

==Consequences==
Oceanic anoxic events have had many important consequences. It is believed that they have been responsible for mass [[extinction events|extinctions]] of marine organisms both in the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]].&lt;ref name="10.1146.2Fannurev.earth.36.031207.124256"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = K. M.| first2 = L.

  |bibcode = 2008AREPS..36..251M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Toarcian and [[Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event]]s correlate with the [[Toarcian turnover|Toarcian]] and [[Cenomanian-Turonian extinction event]]s of mostly marine life forms. Apart from possible atmospheric effects, many deeper-dwelling marine organisms could not adapt to an ocean where oxygen penetrated only the surface layers.

An economically significant consequence of oceanic anoxic events is the fact that the prevailing conditions in so many Mesozoic oceans has helped produce most of the world's [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] reserves. During an oceanic anoxic event, the accumulation and preservation of organic matter was much greater than normal, allowing the generation of potential petroleum [[source rock]]s in many environments across the globe. Consequently, some 70 percent of oil source rocks are Mesozoic in age, and another 15 percent date from the warm Paleogene: only rarely in colder periods were conditions favorable for the production of source rocks on anything other than a local scale.

===Atmospheric effects===
A model put forward by Lee Kump, Alexander Pavlov and Michael Arthur in 2005 suggests that oceanic anoxic events may have been characterized by upwelling of water rich in highly toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, which was then released into the atmosphere. This phenomenon would probably have poisoned plants and animals and caused mass extinctions. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the hydrogen sulfide rose to the upper atmosphere and attacked the [[ozone layer]], which normally blocks the deadly [[ultraviolet radiation]] of the [[Sun]]. The increased UV radiation caused by this [[ozone depletion]] would have amplified the destruction of plant and animal life. Fossil spores from strata recording the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] show deformities consistent with UV radiation. This evidence, combined with fossil [[Bioindicator|biomarker]]s of [[green sulfur bacteria]], indicates that this process could have played a role in that [[mass extinction]] event, and possibly other extinction events. The trigger for these mass extinctions appears to be a warming of the ocean caused by a rise of carbon dioxide levels to about 1000 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocean chemistry effects===
Reduced oxygen levels are expected to lead to increased seawater concentrations of redox-sensitive metals. The reductive dissolution of [[iron]]–[[manganese]] oxyhydroxides in seafloor sediments under low-oxygen conditions would release those metals and associated trace metals. Sulfate reduction in such sediments could release other metals such as [[barium]]. When heavy-metal-rich anoxic deep water entered continental shelves and encountered increased O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, precipitation of some of the metals, as well as poisoning of the local biota, would have occurred. In the late Silurian mid-[[Silurian#Pridoli|Pridoli]] event, increases are seen in the Fe, Cu, As, Al, Pb, Ba, Mo and Mn levels in shallow-water sediment and microplankton; this is associated with a marked increase in the malformation rate in [[chitinozoan]]s and other microplankton types, likely due to metal toxicity.&lt;ref name="Vandenbroucke2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vandenbroucke|first1=T.

==Anoxic events in Earth's history==

===Cretaceous===
{{Main|Cretaceous}}
{{See also|Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event}}
Sulfidic (or euxinic) conditions, which exist today in many [[water bodies]] from [[pond]]s to various land-surrounded [[mediterranean sea]]s&lt;ref
 name="dicdef-1"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mediterranean definition of mediterranean sea]; "6. surrounded or nearly surrounded by land."&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Black Sea]], were particularly prevalent in the [[Cretaceous]] Atlantic but also characterized other parts of the world ocean. In an ice-free sea of these supposed super-greenhouse worlds, oceanic waters were as much as 200 meters higher, in some eras. During the time spans in question, the [[continental plate]]s are believed to have been well separated, and the [[mountain]]s we know today were (mostly) future [[tectonic]] events—meaning the overall landscapes were generally much lower— and even the half super-greenhouse climates would have been eras of highly expedited water erosion&lt;ref name="HistOfOil"/&gt;  carrying massive amounts of nutrients into the world oceans fueling an overall explosive population of microorganisms and their predator species in the oxygenated upper layers.

Detailed stratigraphic studies of Cretaceous black shales from many parts of the world have indicated that two oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) were particularly significant in terms of their impact on the chemistry of the oceans, one in the early [[Aptian]] (~120 Ma), sometimes called the [[Selli Event]] (or OAE 1a) &lt;ref name="oaedef"&gt;{{cite journal

* Insofar as the Cretaceous OAEs can be represented by type localities, it is the striking outcrops of laminated black shales within the vari-colored claystones and pink and white limestones near the town of Gubbio in the Italian [[Apennines]] that are the best candidates.
* The 1-meter thick black shale at the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary that crops out near Gubbio is termed the ‘Livello Bonarelli’ after the man who first described it in 1891.

More minor oceanic anoxic events have been proposed for other intervals in the Cretaceous (in the [[Valanginian]], [[Hauterivian]], [[Albian]] and [[Coniacian]]–[[Santonian]] stages), but their sedimentary record, as represented by organic-rich black shales, appears more parochial, being dominantly represented in the Atlantic and neighboring areas, and some researchers relate them to particular local conditions rather than being forced by global change.

===Jurassic===
{{Main|Jurassic}}
The only oceanic anoxic event documented from the Jurassic took place during the early [[Toarcian]] (~183 Ma).&lt;ref name="Gronstal 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen 2008"/&gt; Because no DSDP ([[Deep Sea Drilling Project]]) or ODP ([[Ocean Drilling Program]]) cores have recovered black shales of this age – there being little or no Toarcian ocean crust remaining in the world ocean – the samples of black shale primarily come from outcrops on land.  These outcrops, together with material from some commercial oil wells, are found on all major continents and this event seems similar in kind to the two major Cretaceous examples.

===Paleozoic===
{{Main|Paleozoic}}
The boundary between the Ordovician and Silurian periods is marked by repetitive periods of anoxia, interspersed with normal, oxic conditions. In addition, anoxic periods are found during the Silurian.  These anoxic periods occurred at a time of low global temperatures (although {{co2}} levels were high), in the midst of a glaciation.&lt;ref name=Page2007&gt;{{palAss2007|author=Page, A. |author2=Zalasiewicz, J. |author3=Williams, M |last-author-amp=yes |title=Deglacial anoxia in a long-lived Early Palaeozoic Icehouse. |pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeppsson (1990) proposes a mechanism whereby the temperature of polar waters determines the site of formation of downwelling water.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the high latitude waters are below {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, they will be dense enough to sink; as they are cool, oxygen is highly soluble in their waters, and the deep ocean will be oxygenated.  If high latitude waters are warmer than {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, their density is too low for them to sink below the cooler deep waters.  Therefore, thermohaline circulation can only be driven by salt-increased density, which tends to form in warm waters where evaporation is high.  This warm water can dissolve less oxygen, and is produced in smaller quantities, producing a sluggish circulation with little deep water oxygen.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990/&gt;  The effect of this warm water propagates through the ocean, and reduces the amount of {{co2}} that the oceans can hold in solution, which makes the oceans release large quantities of {{co2}} into the atmosphere in a geologically short time (tens or thousands of years).&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;  The warm waters also initiate the [[Clathrate gun hypothesis|release of clathrates]], which further increases atmospheric temperature and basin anoxia.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;  Similar positive feedbacks operate during cold-pole episodes, amplifying their cooling effects.

The periods with cold poles are termed "P-episodes" (short for ''primo''&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and are characterised by [[Bioturbation|bioturbated]] deep oceans, a humid equator and higher weathering rates, and terminated by extinction events - for example, the [[Ireviken event|Ireviken]] and [[Lau event]]s.  The inverse is true for the warmer, oxic "S-episodes" (''secundo''), where deep ocean sediments are typically [[graptolit]]ic black shales.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1990/&gt;
A typical cycle of ''secundo-primo'' episodes and ensuing ''event'' typically lasts around 3&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

The duration of events is so long compared to their onset because the positive feedbacks must be overwhelmed.  Carbon content in the ocean-atmosphere system is affected by changes in weathering rates, which in turn is dominantly controlled by rainfall. Because this is inversely related to temperature in Silurian times, carbon is gradually drawn down during warm (high {{co2}}) S-episodes, while the reverse is true during P-episodes.  On top of this gradual trend is overprinted the signal of [[Milankovic cycles]], which ultimately trigger the switch between P- and S- episodes.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

These events become longer during the Devonian; the enlarging land plant biota probably acted as a large buffer to carbon dioxide concentrations.&lt;ref name=Jeppsson1997/&gt;

The end-Ordovician Hirnantian event may alternatively be a result of algal blooms, caused by sudden supply of nutrients through wind-driven upwelling or an influx of nutrient-rich meltwater from melting glaciers, which by virtue of its fresh nature would also slow down oceanic circulation.&lt;ref name="Lüning2006"&gt;{{cite journal

===Archean and Proterozoic===
It has been thought that through most of Earth's history, oceans were largely oxygen-deficient. During the [[Archean]], euxinia was largely absent because of low availability of [[sulfate]] in the oceans,&lt;ref name="Kump 2008"/&gt; but during the Proterozoic, it would become more common.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19222">'''Apex'''  radio stations (also known as '''skyscraper''' and '''pinnacle''') was the name commonly given to a short-lived group of United States [[radio broadcasting|broadcasting]] stations, which were used to evaluate transmitting on [[frequencies]] that were much higher than the ones used by standard [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) and [[shortwave]] stations. Their name came from the tall height of their transmitter [[antenna (radio)|antennas]], which were needed because coverage was primarily limited to local line-of-sight distances. These stations were assigned to what at the time were described as "ultra-high" frequencies, between roughly 25 and 44 [[MHz]]. They employed AM transmissions, although in most cases using a wider bandwidth than standard broadcast band AM stations, in order to provide high fidelity sound with less static and distortion.

In 1937 the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) formally allocated an Apex station band, consisting of 75 transmitting frequencies running from 41.02 to 43.98&amp;nbsp;MHz. These stations were never given permission to operate commercially, although they were allowed to retransmit the programming from standard AM stations. Most operated under experimental licenses, however this band was the first to include a formal "non-commercial educational" station classification. The FCC eventually decided there was no need for a second AM broadcast band, so the Apex station assignments were eliminated effective January 1, 1941. With this change, a few of the original Apex stations were converted into some of the earliest [[frequency modulation|FM]] stations. 

==Initial development==

Through the 1920s and 1930s, radio engineers and government regulators were slowly determining the transmission characteristics of various frequencies being evaluated for use by radio stations. In the United States, by 1930 the original AM broadcasting band consisted of 96 frequencies from 550 to 1500&amp;nbsp;kHz, with a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing between adjacent assignments. On this band, a station's coverage during the daytime consisted exclusively of its [[groundwave]] signal, which for the most powerful stations might exceed 200 miles (320 kilometers), although it was significantly less for the average station. However, during the nighttime, changes in the [[ionosphere]] resulted in additional long distance [[skywave]] signals, that were commonly reflected for up to hundreds of kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2015/01/radio-signals-travel-night-day/ "Why Do Radio Signals Travel Farther at Night than in the Day?"] by Dan Elder, January 27, 2015. (todayifoundout.com)&lt;/ref&gt;	

Over time, the technology was developed to transmit on progressively higher frequencies. (Although initially these were in general called "ultra-high" frequencies, [[radio spectrum]] nomenclature was later standardized, with 3 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz transmissions becoming known as "High Frequency" (HF), 30 to 300&amp;nbsp;MHz called "Very High Frequency" (VHF), and 300 to 3,000&amp;nbsp;MHz called "Ultra High Frequency" (UHF)).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jneuhaus.com/fccindex/spectrum.html Allocation of Radio Spectrum in the United States"] (jneuhaus.com)&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became apparent that there were significant differences in the propagation characteristics of various frequency ranges. Signals from [[shortwave]] stations, operating roughly in the range from 5&amp;nbsp;MHz to 20&amp;nbsp;MHz, were found to be readily reflected by the ionosphere during both the day and at night, resulting in stations that sometimes could transmit halfway around the world. 

Investigation of ever higher frequencies found that, above around 20&amp;nbsp;MHz, signal propagation by both groundwave and skywave generally became minimal, which meant that station coverage now began to be limited to just [[Line-of-sight_propagation|line-of-sight]] distances from the transmitting antenna. This was considered to be a valuable characteristic by the FCC, because it would allow the establishment of broadcasting stations with limited but consistent day and night coverage, that could only be received by their local communities. It also meant that multiple stations could operate on the same frequency throughout the country without interfering with each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/uham/horizon.html "The VHF/UHF Line of Sight Horizon"] (em.hawaii.edu)&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the standard AM broadcast band was considered to be too full to allow any meaningful increase in the number of stations, the FCC began to issue licenses to parties interested in testing the suitability of higher frequencies. Most Apex stations operated under experimental licenses, and were commonly affiliated with and subsidized by a commercially licensed AM station. Until the late 1930s, commercially made radio receivers did not cover these high frequencies, so early Apex station listeners constructed their own receivers, or built converters for existing models.

On March 18, 1934, [[WTSS|W8XH]] in Buffalo, New York, a companion station to AM station [[WBEN (AM)|WBEN]], became the first Apex station to air a regular schedule.&lt;ref&gt;"Pioneering" (WBEN advertisement), ''Broadcasting'', April 1, 1936, page 29. W8XH is a direct predecessor of current Buffalo FM station [[WTSS]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of these stations merely retransmitted the programs of their AM station partners, in a few cases efforts were made to provide original programming. In 1936, [[The Milwaukee Journal]]'s W9XAZ, which initially had relayed the programming of [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]], became the first Apex station to originate its own programming on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://jeff560.tripod.com/fm1.html Apex Station On Its Own]", ''Broadcasting'', Jan. 1, 1937. "[http://jeff560.tripod.com/fm1.html Milwaukee Station Using Apex Band Tells of Results]", ''Broadcasting'', May 15, 1937. W9XAZ eventually became WTMJ-FM, which was deleted in 1950. Nine years later a new WTMJ-FM was licensed; it is the current day [[WKTI-FM]] at 94.5&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While monitoring the first group of stations, it was soon realized that, due to the strengthening of the ionosphere during periods of high solar activity, at times the lower end of the VHF frequencies would produce strong, and undesirable, skywave signals. (The December 1937 issue of ''All-Wave Radio'' reported that W6XKG in Los Angeles, transmitting on 25.95&amp;nbsp;MHz, had been heard in both Asia and Europe, while W9XAZ, 26.4&amp;nbsp;MHz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin had "a strong signal in Australia", and W8XAI, 31.6&amp;nbsp;MHz in Rochester, New York, "is another station that is often heard in Australia.")&lt;ref&gt;"Ultra-High: When to Listen - What to Listen For" by Perry Ferrell, Jr., ''All-Wave Radio'', December 1937, page 628.&lt;/ref&gt; This most commonly occurred during the summer months, and during peaks in the 11-year [[sunspot cycle]]. This determination led to the FCC moving the developing broadcasting service stations, which by now began to include experimental FM and TV stations, to higher frequencies that were less affected by solar influences.

==Apex band establishment (1937)==
In October 1937, the FCC announced a sweeping allocation of frequency assignments for the various competing services, including television, relay, and public service, which covered 10&amp;nbsp;kHz to 300&amp;nbsp;MHz. Included was a band of Apex stations, consisting of 75 channels with 40&amp;nbsp;kHz separations, and spanning from 41.02 to 43.98&amp;nbsp;MHz. The 40&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing between adjacent frequencies was four times as much as the 10&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing on the standard AM broadcast band, which reduced adjacent-frequency interference, and provided more bandwidth for high-fidelity programming.

At the time it was estimated that there were about 50 Apex-style stations currently in operation, although transmitting on a variety of frequencies.&lt;ref name="upper"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting13unse_0#page/n749/mode/1up "Upper Bands Set Aside for Television"], ''Broadcasting'', November 1, 1937, pages 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1938 the band's first 25 channels, from 41.02 to 41.98&amp;nbsp;MHz, were reserved for non-commercial educational stations, with the Cleveland City Board of Education's WBOE in Cleveland, Ohio the first station to begin operation within this group.&lt;ref&gt;"Listening to Learn", ''Radio Guide'', November 26, 1938, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to FM (1941)==

At the time the Apex band was established, the FCC noted that "The Commission at an early date will consider carefully the needs and requirements for high-frequency broadcast stations using both conventional [AM] modulation and frequency modulation".&lt;ref name="upper"/&gt; As of January 15, 1940, only 2 non-commercial&lt;ref&gt;"Non-Commercial Educational Broadcast Stations", ''Broadcasting Yearbook'' (1940), page 387. The two stations were WBOE in Cleveland, Ohio and WNYE in Brooklyn, New York. WBKY in Beattyville, Kentucky would become the third non-commercial educational station later in the year.&lt;/ref&gt; and 14 experimental stations held Apex band licenses, all of which were assigned operating frequencies in the bottom half of the band. (A similar number of experimental stations held grants for frequencies in the 25-26&amp;nbsp;MHz region.) In addition, at this same time 20 experimental FM stations had been assigned slots within the top half of the Apex band frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;"High Frequency Broadcasting Stations in the United States", ''Broadcasting Yearbook'' (1940), page 374.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission's studies soon found significant advantages to FM transmissions over the Apex AM signals. Sound quality, and especially resistance to interference from static, including from lightning, was found to be far superior for FM. Although FM assignments required five times the bandwidth of Apex stations (200&amp;nbsp;kHz vs. 40&amp;nbsp;kHz), the "[[capture effect]]" allowed FM stations operating on the same frequency to be spaced closer together than Apex stations. By 1939 the FCC began encouraging Apex stations to consider changing to the technically superior FM transmissions. In 1940, the FCC decided to authorize a commercial FM band effective January 1, 1941, operating on 40 channels spanning 42–50&amp;nbsp;MHz (this was later changed to 88–106&amp;nbsp;MHz, and still later to 88–108&amp;nbsp;MHz.)

This new assignment also resulted in the elimination of the Apex band, and the Apex stations were informed that they needed to either go silent or convert to FM. The last of the Apex stations to leave the air were WBOE, which shut down its Apex operation in February 1941 and converted to FM that month,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting20unse#page/n388/mode/1up "Education by FM"], ''Broadcasting'', February 10, 1941, page 49.&lt;/ref&gt; and WBKY, which suspended operations after June 27, 1941 due to financial reasons.&lt;ref name="wbky"/&gt; Currently, the frequencies that had been used by the Apex band are allocated for land mobile communication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://transition.fcc.gov/oet/spectrum/table/fcctable.pdf "FCC Online Table of Frequency Allocations"] (fcc.gov)&lt;/ref&gt;

There would be at least one attempt to revive the Apex band concept. Beginning in May 1946, consulting radio engineer [[Sarkes Tarzian]] operated a 200-watt experimental AM station, W9XHZ, on 87.75&amp;nbsp;MHz in Bloomington, Indiana. After two years of successful operation of what he referred to as his "HIFAM" station,&lt;ref&gt;"HiFam Radio Bans Static with Gadget" (AP), ''Williamsport (Pennsylvania) Sun-Gazette'', June 27, 1947, page 9. "HIFAM" was a contraction of "high frequency amplitude modulation".&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948 he proposed that the FCC allocate a small high-frequency broadcast band, 400&amp;nbsp;kHz wide with 10&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing between frequency assignments. Tarzian promoted this as a low-cost alternative to expensive FM transmitters and receivers, saying that a $5.95 converter could be added to existing AM radios that would allow them to pick up the HIFAM stations.&lt;ref&gt;"HIFAM" by Larry Christopher, ''Broadcasting/Telecasting'', May 3, 1948, pages 22, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to operate his experimental station, which eventually became KS2XAP, until 1950, although by then its transmitting hours were greatly restricted, as the FCC required the station to remain off the air whenever nearby WFBM-TV in Indianapolis was broadcasting. This was due to the fact that the TV station's audio transmitter used the same frequency as Tarzian's station.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting38unse_0#page/n432/mode/1up/ "HIFAM Renewal"], ''Broadcasting/Telecasting'', April 24, 1950, page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, after his station's final license expired on June 1, 1950 the FCC denied Tarzian any further renewals,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting38unse_0#page/n923/mode/1up/search/ "HIFAM Renewal Denied By FCC"], ''Broadcasting/Telecasting'', June 5, 1950, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; concluding it would not reverse its earlier determination that there was no need for a second AM broadcast band.

'''Architectural analytics''' is the field of study that focuses on the discovery and identification of meaningful patterns in [[architecture]].

Architecture represents a snapshot in time and can, in a very detailed fashion, animate the [[civilisation]] and people that created it. Architectural analytics can allow a large amount of information about a monument, settlement or civilisation to be discerned. This ability to inform and present previously unknown facts makes architectural analytics important in piecing together the larger understanding of civilisations and the human story.

'''Arthur Argo''' (1935–1981) was a Scottish traditional folk musician, promoter and collector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb231ms3088andgb231ms3124 |title=gb231-ms3088etc - Papers of Arthur Argo and Arthur Barron |publisher=Archives Hub |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the great grandson of [[Gavin Greig]].

Argo came from a family with a rich traditional song heritage. Argo worked alongside [[Hamish Henderson]] collecting field recordings from the North East of [[Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobarandualchais.co.uk/en/ |title=index |publisher=Tobar an Dualchais |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and beyond. Argo, was a promoter of the work of Scottish folk artists and their music. After working as a journalist in the North East, from 1966 he worked for [[BBC Scotland]], from 1973 as a producer with Radio Scotland. He produced the long-running radio series 'Fit Like Folk?', and 'The Reel Blend', a Scottish music series. He was the founder and president of the [[Aberdeen Folksong Club]] and published a series of folk song booklets in the 1960s called 'Chapbook'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/maclean/works/ballad.htm |title=Ballad Of John Maclean |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many musicians such as [[Aly Bain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folkfire.org/v6n1.htm |title=FolkFire Articles Archive, v6,n1 |publisher=Folkfire.org |date=1999-02-13 |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Dickson]], [[Jean Redpath]] and [[Billy Connolly]] cite Argo as a major influence and stepping stone in their early careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Aidan |url=http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/scotland/right-down-the-line-remembering-gerry-rafferty-1-2032994 |title=Right down the line: Remembering Gerry Rafferty |publisher=The Scotsman |date=2012-01-03 |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argo visited the United States twice in the early 1960s and met many of the established and rising stars of the American folk scene including [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Bob Dylan]].

[[Australian]] Aboriginal [[kinship]] are the systems of [[law]] governing social interaction, particularly [[marriage]], in traditional [[Australian Aboriginal culture]]s. It is an integral part of the culture of every [[List of Indigenous Australian group names|Aboriginal group]] across Australia.

==The subsection system==

Subsection systems are a unique social structure that divide all of Australian Aboriginal society into a number of groups, each of which combines particular sets of kin. In Central Australian Aboriginal English vernacular, subsections are widely known as "'''skins'''". Each subsection is given a name that can be used to refer to individual members of that group. Skin is passed down by a person's parents to their children.

The name of the groups can vary. There are systems with two such groupings (these are known as '[[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]]' in kinship studies), systems with four (sections), six and eight (subsection systems). Some language groups extend this by having distinct male and female forms, giving a total of sixteen skin names, for example the Pintupi (listed below) and Warlpiri. While membership in skin groups is ideally based on blood relations, Australian Aboriginal subsection systems are classificatory, meaning that even people who are not actual blood relations are assigned to a subsection. They are also universal, meaning that every member of the society is assigned a position in the system.

Subsection systems are found in Aboriginal societies across much of Central, Western and Northern Australia. On the basis of detailed analysis and comparison of the various subsection systems and their terminologies, and in particular the apparent prefix /j-/ for male and /n-/ for female, it has been identified as a social innovation originally from the Daly River region of the Northern Territory, which then spread rapidly southwards to other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Systems with two groupings (moieties)===

====Yolngu====

The [[Yolngu|Yolŋu]] people of north-eastern [[Arnhem Land]] divide society (and much of the natural world) into two [[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]]: ''Dhuwa'' and ''Yirritja''. Each of these is represented by people of a number of different groups (each with their own lands, languages and philosophies) through their [[hereditary]] [[Estate (law)|estates]] – so many things are either ''Yirritja'' or ''Dhuwa'':

|Rirratjingu, Galpu, Djambarrpuyngu, Golumala, Marrakulu,&lt;br/&gt;Marrangu, Djapu, Datiwuy, Ngaymil, Djarrwark.
|}

Fish, stone, river, sea etc., belongs to one or the other moiety. Things that are not either Dhuwa or Yirritja are called ''wakinŋu''. Yolŋu also have a kinship system with eight subsections (four Dhuwa and four Yirritja which is what creates moiety).

===Systems with four sections===

====Gamilaraay====

The [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] language group from [[New South Wales]] have a four section system.

====Martuthunira====

The [[Martuthunira language|Martuthunira]] language group from the [[Pilbara]] region of [[Western Australia]] have a four section system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Bilybara: Aboriginal languages of the Pilbara region |last=Sharp, Janet |author2=Nicholas Thieberger |year=1992 |publisher= Wangka Maya, The Pilbara Aboriginal Language Centre|location= Port Hedland, Western Australia |isbn= 0-646-10711-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The spelling '''''l.y''''' indicates that the letters represent two distinct [[phoneme]]s, and are not a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]).

Similar systems are found across most language groups in the Pilbara, though with some variation in the forms of the names. For example, speakers of [[Ngarla language|Ngarla]] use ''Milangka'' where Martuthunira use ''Pal.yarri''.

====Alyawarra====

The [[Alyawarre]] language group from [[Central Australia]] also have a four section system, but use different terms from the Martuthunira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Simple Introduction to Central Australian Kinship Systems |last=Wafer, Jim |year=1982 |publisher= Institute for Aboriginal Development, Alice Springs, Northern Territory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems with eight groups (subsection systems)===

====Lardil====
The [[Lardil]] of [[Mornington Island]] in the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] have eight subsection groups, shown here with some of their totems:

|Balyarriny
|''Black tiger shark,&lt;br/&gt;sea turtle''
|Kamarrangi
|Buranyi
|-
|Bangariny
|''Brown shark, turtle''
|Yakimarr
|Ngarrijbalangi
|-
|Buranyi
|''Crane, salt water, &lt;br/&gt;sleeping turtle''
|Kangal
|Balyarriny
|-
|Burrarangi
|''Lightning, rough sea,&lt;br/&gt;black dingo''
|Ngarrijbalangi
|Kamarrangi
|-
|Kamarrangi
|''Rock, pelican, [[brolga]],&lt;br/&gt;red dingo''
|Balyarriny
|Burrarangi
|-
|Kangal
|''[[Barramundi]],&lt;br/&gt;grey shark''
|Buranyi
|Yakimarr
|-
|Ngarrijbalangi
|''Rainbird, shooting star,&lt;br/&gt;egret''
|Burrarangi
|Bangariny
|-
|Yakimarr
|''Seagull, barramundi,&lt;br/&gt;grey shark''
|Bangariny
|Kangal
|}

Each Lardil person belongs to one of these groups. Their paternal [[grandfather]]'s subsection determines their own; so a Balyarriny man or woman will have a Balyarriny grandfather. Members of each group may only marry members of one other, specified, group.

Once a person's subsection group is known, their relationship to any other Lardil can be determined. A Ngarrijbalangi is a 'father' to a Bangariny, a 'father-in-law' to a Yakimarr and a 'son' to another Bangariny, either in a social sense or purely through linearship.

The mechanics of the Lardil skin system means that generations of males cycle back and forth between two subsections. ''Ngarrijbalangi'' is father to ''Bangariny'' and ''Bangariny'' is father to ''Ngarrijbalangi'' and similarly for the three other pairs of subsections. Generations of women, however, cycle through four subsections before arriving back at the starting point. This means that a woman has the same subsection name as her ([[Matrilineality|matrilineal]]) great-great-grandmother.

====Pintupi====&lt;!-- This section header is linked to from the article "Makinti Napanangka" --&gt;
The [[Pintupi]] of the [[Western Desert (Australia)|Western Desert]] also have an eight subsection system, made more complex by distinct forms for male and female subsection names; male forms begin with "Tj", the female forms with "N". The [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]] system is almost the same:

====Kunwinjku====
The [[Kunwinjku language|Kunwinjku]] of [[Arnhem Land|Western Arnhem Land]] have a similar system; male forms begin with "Na", the female forms with "Ngal":&lt;ref&gt;Etherington, Steven; Etherington, Narelle, ''[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/15561244?selectedversion=NBD12689936 Kunwinjku Kunwok : a short introduction to Kunwinjku language and society]'', Kunwinjku Language Centre, 1996, {{ISBN|0958690901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each person therefore has a [[patriline|patrimoiety]] and a [[matriline|matrimoiety]], a father's and a mother's subsection group.

===Extension of the system to non-relatives===

Outsiders who have significant interaction with such groups may be given a 'skin name', commonly based on the people they have interacted with and the types of interaction.

==Some common kinship terms used in Aboriginal English==
{{Main article|Australian Aboriginal English}}

The variety of English used by many Australian Aboriginal people employs kinship terms in ways that are based on their equivalents in Australian Aboriginal languages.

*''Aunty'' and ''uncle''  are terms of address for older people, to whom the speaker may not be related. 
*''Brother'' and ''sister''—as well as siblings this term is used to refer to children of one's mother's sister and of father's brother (cousin), just as in many indigenous languages.
*''Cousin-brother'' and ''cousin-sister'' are often used to refer to children of one's mother's sister and father's brother.
*''Cousin'' refers to children of one's father's sister and mother's brother, but may be extended to any relative of one's own generation, such as one who might share the same great grandparent as their own great grandparent, which is a second-cousin in Aboriginal terms.
*In south-east Queensland, ''daughter'' is used to refer to any woman of one's great-grandparents' generation. This is due to the cyclical nature of traditional kinship systems and mirrors usage in many Australian languages.
*''Father'' and ''mother'' include any relative of one's parents' generation, such as uncles, aunts, their own cousins and in-laws.
*''Grandfather'' and ''grandmother'' can refer to anyone of one's grandparents' generation. ''Grandfather'' can also refer to any respected elderly man, to whom the speaker may not be related.
*''Poison'' refers to a relation one is obligated to avoid. See ''[[Mother-in-law language]]''.
*The term ''second'', or ''little bit'' in northern Australia, is used with a distant relative who is described using a close kinship term. For example, one's ''second father'' or ''little bit father'' is a man of one's father's generation not closely related to the speaker. Usually having a ''second mother'' is having a woman of your own mother's generation who seems to act like a mother and would most likely care for you if anything were to happen to your own parents. It is contrasted with ''close'', ''near'' or ''true''.
*A ''skin'' or ''skin group'' is a section determined by the skin of a person's parents, and determines who a person is eligible to marry.
*''Son'' can refer to any male of the next generation, such as nephews, just as ''daughter'' can refer to any female of the next generation, including nieces.

[[File:Carbonate system of seawater.svg|thumb|Example Bjerrum plot: Change in carbonate system of seawater from [[ocean acidification]].]]

A '''Bjerrum plot''' (named after [[Niels Bjerrum]]) is a [[chart|graph]] of the [[concentration]]s of the different species of a [[Acid#Polyprotic acids|polyprotic acid]] in a [[solution]], as functions of the solution's [[pH]],&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Andersen|first=C. B.|coauthors= |year=2002 |title=Understanding carbonate equilibria by measuring alkalinity in experimental and natural systems |url= |archiveurl= |archivedate=  | journal=Journal of Geoscience Education |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=389–403 |doi=10.5408/1089-9995-50.4.389 |pmid= |bibcode=2002JGeEd..50..389A}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the solution is at [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]]. Due to the many [[orders of magnitude]] spanned by the concentrations, they are commonly plotted on a [[logarithmic scale]]. Sometimes the ratios of the concentrations are plotted rather than the actual concentrations. Occasionally H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are also plotted.

Most often, the carbonate system is plotted, where the polyprotic acid is [[carbonic acid]] (a [[diprotic acid]]), and the different species are [[carbonic acid]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[bicarbonate]], and [[carbonate]]. In acidic conditions, the dominant form is {{CO2}}; in [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] (alkalinic) conditions, the dominant form is CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;; and in between, the dominant form is HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. At every pH, the concentration of carbonic acid is assumed to be negligible compared to the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and so is often omitted from Bjerrum plots. These plots are typically used in ocean chemistry to track the response of an ocean to changes in both pH and of inputs in carbonate and {{chem|CO|2}}.&lt;ref name="wolfgladrow2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author=D.A. Wolf-Gladrow| title=Total alkalinity: the explicit conservative expression and its application to biogeochemical processes| journal=Marine Chemistry| year=2007| volume=106| issue=1| url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/faculty/zeebe_files/Publications/WolfGladrowMarChem07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bjerrum plots for other polyprotic acids, including [[Silicic acid|silicic]], [[Boric acid|boric]], [[Sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[Phosphoric acid|phosphoric]] acids, can also be constructed.&lt;ref name=Andersen /&gt;

==Bjerrum plot equations for carbonate system==
[[File:Carbonate Bjerrum.gif|thumb|alt=Distribution of DIC (Carbonate) species with pH for 25C and 5,000 ppm salinity (e.g. salt-water swimming pool) - Bjerrum plot]]
If [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbonic acid]], [[hydron (chemistry)|hydrogen ions]], [[bicarbonate]] and [[carbonate]] are all dissolved in [[water]], and at [[chemical equilibrium]], their equilibrium [[concentration]]s are often assumed to be given by:

: &lt;math&gt; [\textrm{CO}_2]_{eq} =  \frac{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2 + K_1[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq} + K_1K_2} \times \textrm{DIC},  &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; [\textrm{HCO}_3^-]_{eq} =  \frac{K_1[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2 + K_1[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq} + K_1K_2} \times \textrm{DIC},  &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; [\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}]_{eq} =  \frac{K_1K_2}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2 + K_1[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq} + K_1K_2} \times \textrm{DIC},  &lt;/math&gt;
where the subscript 'eq' denotes that these are equilibrium concentrations, ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[equilibrium constant]] for the reaction {{chem|CO|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e. the first [[acid dissociation constant]] for carbonic acid), ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[equilibrium constant]] for the reaction HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e. the second [[acid dissociation constant]] for carbonic acid), and DIC is the (unchanging) total [[concentration]] of [[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]] in the system, i.e. [{{CO2}}] + [HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] + [CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]. ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and DIC each have units of a [[concentration]], e.g. [[Mole (unit)|mol]]/[[litre]].

A Bjerrum plot is obtained by using these three equations to plot these three species against pH = –{{nowrap|log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;}}, for given ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and DIC. The fractions in these equations give the three species' relative proportions, and so if DIC is unknown, or the actual concentrations are unimportant, these proportions may be plotted instead.

These three equations show that the curves for {{CO2}} and HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; intersect at [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the curves for HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; intersect at [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. Therefore, the values of ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' that were used to create a given Bjerrum plot can easily be found from that plot, by reading off the concentrations at these points of intersection. An example with linear Y axis is shown in the accompanying graph. It should be noted that the values of K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and therefore the curves in the Bjerrum plot, vary substantially with temperature and salinity.&lt;ref&gt;Mook W (2000) Chemistry of carbonic acid in water.

==Chemical and mathematical derivation of Bjerrum plot equations for carbonate system==
Suppose that the reactions between [[carbon dioxide]], [[hydron (chemistry)|hydrogen ions]], [[bicarbonate]] and [[carbonate]] [[ions]], all dissolved in [[water]], are as follows:
: {{chem|CO|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} (1)
: {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} (2)

(Note that reaction (1) is actually the combination of two [[elementary reaction]]s: {{chem|CO|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} {{chem|H|2|CO|3}} {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.)

Assuming the [[mass action law]] applies to these two reactions, that water is [[Abundance (chemistry)|abundant]], and that the different chemical species are always well-mixed, their [[rate equation]]s are
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\textrm{d}[\textrm{CO}_2]}{\textrm{d}t}= -k_1[\textrm{CO}_2] + k_{-1}[\textrm{H}^+][\textrm{HCO}_3^-], &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\textrm{d}[\textrm{H}^+]}{\textrm{d}t}= k_1[\textrm{CO}_2] - k_{-1}[\textrm{H}^+][\textrm{HCO}_3^-] + k_2[\textrm{HCO}_3^-] - k_{-2}[\textrm{H}^+][\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}], &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\textrm{d}[\textrm{HCO}_3^-]}{\textrm{d}t}= k_1[\textrm{CO}_2] - k_{-1}[\textrm{H}^+][\textrm{HCO}_3^-] - k_2[\textrm{HCO}_3^-] + k_{-2}[\textrm{H}^+][\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}], &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\textrm{d}[\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}]}{\textrm{d}t}= k_2[\textrm{HCO}_3^-] - k_{-2}[\textrm{H}^+][\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}], &lt;/math&gt;
where [{{space}}] denotes [[concentration]], ''t'' is time, and ''k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''k&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;'' are appropriate [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] constants for reaction (1), called respectively the forwards and reverse [[Reaction rate constant|rate constants]] for this reaction. (Similarly ''k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''k&lt;sub&gt;−2&lt;/sub&gt;'' for reaction (2).)

{{space}}

'''At any equilibrium''', the concentrations are unchanging, hence the left hand sides of these equations are zero. Then, from the first of these four equations, the ratio of reaction (1)'s rate constants equals the ratio of its equilibrium concentrations, and this ratio, called ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', is called the [[equilibrium constant]] for reaction (1), i.e.
: &lt;math&gt; K_1 = \frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} = \frac{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}[\textrm{HCO}_3^-]_{eq}}{[\textrm{CO}_2]_{eq}}, &lt;/math&gt; {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} (3) {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}}
where the subscript 'eq' denotes that these are equilibrium concentrations.

Similarly, from the fourth equation for the [[equilibrium constant]] ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' for reaction (2),
: &lt;math&gt; K_2 = \frac{k_2}{k_{-2}} = \frac{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}[\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}]_{eq}}{[\textrm{HCO}_3^-]_{eq}}. &lt;/math&gt; {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} (4)

Rearranging (3) gives
: &lt;math&gt; [\textrm{HCO}_3^-]_{eq} =  \frac{K_1[\textrm{CO}_2]_{eq}}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}}, &lt;/math&gt; {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} (5)
and rearranging (4), then substituting in (5), gives
: &lt;math&gt; [\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}]_{eq} =  \frac{K_2[\textrm{HCO}_3^-]_{eq}}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}}
=  \frac{K_1K_2[\textrm{CO}_2]_{eq}}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2}. &lt;/math&gt; {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} (6)

{{space}}

The total [[concentration]] of [[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]] in the system is given by
: &lt;math&gt; \textrm{DIC} =  [\textrm{CO}_2] + [\textrm{HCO}_3^-] + [\textrm{CO}_3^{2-}] &lt;/math&gt;
: {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}}  &lt;math&gt;  =  [\textrm{CO}_2]_{eq} \left(1 + \frac{K_1}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}} + \frac{K_1K_2}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2}\right) &lt;/math&gt; {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}}  substituting in (5) and (6)
: {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} {{space}} &lt;math&gt;  =
[\textrm{CO}_2]_{eq} \left(\frac{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2 + K_1[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}+K_1K_2}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

{{space}}

Re-arranging this gives the equation for {{chem|CO|2}}:
: &lt;math&gt; [\textrm{CO}_2]_{eq} =  \frac{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2}{[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq}^2 + K_1[\textrm{H}^+]_{eq} + K_1K_2} \times \textrm{DIC}.  &lt;/math&gt;

{{space}}

The equations for HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; are obtained by substituting this into (5) and (6).

Optimal modulation of both CAF-1 and [[transcription factor]] levels increases reprogramming efficiency by several orders of magnitude and facilitated [[iPS cell]] formation in as little as 4 days. Mechanistically, CAF-1 suppression led to a more accessible chromatin structure at enhancer elements early during reprogramming. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in somatic heterochromatin domains, increased binding of [[Sox2]] to [[pluripotency]]-specific targets and activation of associated genes.

{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
The '''carrying capacity''' of a biological [[species]] in an [[natural environment|environment]] is the maximum population size of the species that the environment can sustain indefinitely, given the food, [[habitat]], [[drinking water|water]], and other [[Resource|necessities available]] in the environment. 
In [[population biology]], carrying capacity is defined as the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]'s maximal load,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hui | first1 = C | year = 2006 | title = Carrying capacity, population equilibrium, and environment's maximal load | url = | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 192 | issue = | pages = 317–320 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2005.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is different from the [[concept]] of population equilibrium. Its effect on [[population dynamics]] may be approximated in a [[logistic function|logistic model]], although this simplification ignores the possibility of [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot]] which real systems may exhibit.

Carrying capacity was originally used to determine the number of animals that could graze on a segment of land without destroying it.  Later, the idea was expanded to more complex populations, like humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carrying Capacity|url=http://www.sustainablescale.org/ConceptualFramework/UnderstandingScale/MeasuringScale/CarryingCapacity.aspx|website=The Sustainable Scale Project|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[human population]], more complex variables such as [[sanitation]] and [[Health care|medical care]] are sometimes considered as part of the necessary establishment. As population density increases, [[birth rate]] often increases and [[death rate]] typically decreases. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is the "natural increase". The carrying capacity could support a positive natural increase or could require a negative natural increase. Thus, the carrying capacity is the number of individuals an environment can support without significant negative impacts to the given organism and its environment. Below carrying capacity, populations typically increase, while above, they typically decrease. A factor that keeps population size at equilibrium is known as a [[regulating factor]]. [[Population decline|Population size decreases]] above carrying capacity due to a range of factors depending on the [[species]] concerned, but can include insufficient [[space]], [[Food security|food supply]], or [[sunlight]]. The carrying capacity of an [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] may vary for different species and may change over time due to a variety of factors including: [[Food security|food availability]], [[water supply]], environmental conditions and living space.
The origins of the term "carrying capacity" are uncertain, with researchers variously stating that it was used "in the context of international [[shipping]]"&lt;ref name="informaworld.com"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sayre |first1=N. F. |year=2008 |title=The Genesis, History, and Limits of Carrying Capacity |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=98 |issue= |pages=120–134 |publisher= |doi= 10.1080/00045600701734356|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a791001773&amp;db=all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that it was first used during 19th-century laboratory experiments with micro-organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerer, K.S., [http://dusk.geo.orst.edu/prosem/PDFs/human_geog.pdf "Human Geography and the "New Ecology": The Prospect of Promise and Integration"], ''Annals of the Assoc. of American Geo.'', '''84'''(1), 108–125, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; A recent review finds the first use of the term in an 1845 report by the [[US Secretary of State]] to the [[US Senate]].&lt;ref name="informaworld.com"/&gt;

Several estimates of the carrying capacity have been made with a wide range of population numbers. A 2001 UN report said that two-thirds of the estimates fall in the range of 4 billion to 16 billion with unspecified standard errors, with a median of about 10 billion.&lt;ref name="UN World Population Report 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpm/wpm2001.pdf|format=PDF|title=UN World Population Report 2001|page=31|accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent estimates are much lower, particularly if [[resource depletion|non-renewable resource depletion]] and [[Overconsumption|increased consumption]] are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in habitat quality or human behavior at any time might increase or reduce carrying capacity. In the view of [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul and Anne Ehrlich]], "for earth as a whole (including those parts of it we call Australia and the United States), human beings are far above carrying capacity today."&lt;ref name=Nineveh-Book/&gt;

The application of the concept of carrying capacity for the [[human population]] has been criticized for not successfully capturing the multi-layered processes between humans and the environment, which have a nature of fluidity and [[non-equilibrium]], and for sometimes being employed in a [[Victim blaming|blame-the-victim]] framework.&lt;ref name=Cliggett&gt;Cliggett, L., "Carrying Capacity's New Guise: Folk Models for Public Debate and Longitudinal Study of Environmental Change", ''[[Africa Today]]'', '''48'''(1), 2-19, (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Although the quote may be good the author doesn't reference anything when making it [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-80493292/carrying-capacity-new-guise.html 1]--&gt;  

Supporters of the concept argue that the idea of a limited carrying capacity is just as valid applied to humans as when applied to any other species. Animal population size, living standards, and resource depletion vary, but the concept of carrying capacity still applies. The number of people is not the only factor in the carrying capacity of Earth. [[Waste]] and [[over-consumption]], especially by wealthy and near-wealthy people and nations, are also putting significant strain on the environment together with [[human overpopulation]]. Population and consumption together appear to be at the core of many human problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/consumption_dwarfs_population_as_main_environmental_threat/2140/|title=Consumption Dwarfs Population as Main Environmental Threat|date=2009-04-13|publisher=Yale University|author=Fred Pearce|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nineveh-Book&gt;{{citation

When scientists talk of global change today, they are usually referring to human-caused changes in the environment of sufficient magnitude eventually to ''reduce'' the carrying capacity of much of Earth (as opposed to local or regional areas) to support organisms, especially ''Homo sapiens.''&lt;ref name=Dominant-Animal-Book&gt;{{citation

===Factors that govern carrying capacity===
Some aspects of a system's carrying capacity may involve matters such as available supplies of [[food supply|food]], [[water supply|water]], raw materials, and/or other similar resources. In addition, there are other factors that govern carrying capacity which may be less instinctive or less intuitive in nature, such as ever-increasing and/or ever-accumulating levels of [[waste]]s, [[environmental damage|damage]], and/or eradication of essential components of any complex functioning system.  Eradication of, for example, large or critical portions of any [[complex system]] (envision a space vehicle, for instance, or an airplane, or an automobile, or computer code, or the body components of a living vertebrate) can interrupt essential processes and dynamics in ways that induce systems failures or unexpected collapse. (As an example of these latter factors, the "carrying capacity" of a complex system such an airplane is more than a matter of available food, or water, or available seating, but also reflects total weight carried and presumes that its passengers do not damage, destroy, or eradicate parts, [[Door|doors]], windows, wings, engine parts, fuel, and oil, and so forth.) Thus, on a global scale, food and similar resources may affect planetary carrying capacity to some extent so long as Earth's human passengers do not dismantle, eradicate, or otherwise destroy critical [[biosphere|biospheric]] life-support capacities for essential processes of self-maintenance, [[self-perpetuation]], and [[self-repair mechanisms|self-repair]].

Thus, carrying capacity interpretations that focus solely on resource limitations alone (such as food) may neglect wider functional factors.  If the humans neither gain nor lose weight in the long-term, the calculation is fairly accurate. If the quantity of food is invariably equal to the "Y" amount, carrying capacity has been reached. Humans, with the need to enhance their reproductive success (see Richard Dawkins' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''{{Verify source|date=May 2009}}&lt;!-- the gene-centric model of evolution is disputed, in particular in sentient species. Contrast with the Expanded Phenotype, also by Dawkins --&gt;), understand that food supply can vary and also that other factors in the environment can alter humans' need for food. A house, for example, might mean that one does not need to eat as much to stay warm as one otherwise would. Over time, monetary transactions have replaced barter and local production, and consequently modified local human carrying capacity. However, purchases also impact regions thousands of miles away. For example, [[carbon dioxide]] from an [[automobile]] travels to the upper atmosphere. This led [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] to develop the [[I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;PAT]] equation.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, P.R., Holdren, J.P., "Impact of Population Growth", [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], '''171'''(3977), 1212–1217, (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

: {{math|1=''I'' = ''P'' ∙ ''A'' ∙ ''T''}}
where:
: ''I'' is the impact on the environment resulting from consumption
: ''P'' is the population number
: ''A'' is the consumption per capita (affluence)
: ''T'' is the technology factor
[[File:Logistic curve examples.png|thumb|This is a graph of the population due to the logistic curve model.  When the population is above the carrying capacity it decreases, and when it is below the carrying capacity it increases.]]
An important model related to carrying capacity (K), is the logistic, growth curve. The logistic growth curve depicts a more realistic version of how population growth rate, available resources, and the carrying capacity are inter-connected. As illustrated in the logistic growth curve model, when the population size is small and there are many resources available, population over-time increases and so does the growth rate. However, as population size nears the carrying capacity and resources become limited, the growth rate decreases and population starts to level out at K. This model is based on the assumption that carrying capacity does not change. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that carrying capacity of a population can increase or decrease and there are various factors that affect it. For instance, an increase in the population growth can lead to over-exploitation of necessary natural resources and therefore decrease the overall carrying capacity of that environment.&lt;ref&gt;Swafford, Angela Lynn.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology can play a role in the dynamics of carrying capacity and while this can sometimes be positive,&lt;ref&gt;Martire, S., Castellani, V., &amp; Sala, S. (2015). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.11.002 Carrying capacity assessment of forest resources: Enhancing environmental sustainability in energy production at local scale] Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 94, 11-20. doi: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.11.002]&lt;/ref&gt; in other cases its influence can be problematic. For example, it has been suggested that in the past that the [[Neolithic]] revolution increased the carrying capacity of the world relative to humans through the invention of agriculture.  In a similar way, viewed from the perspective of foods, the use of [[fossil fuel]]s has been alleged to artificially increase the carrying capacity of the world by the use of stored sunlight, even though that food production does not guarantee the capacity of the Earth's climatic and [[Biosphere|biospheric]] life-support systems to withstand the damage and wastes arising from such fossil fuels.  However, such interpretations presume the continued and uninterrupted functioning of all other critical components of the global system.  It has also been suggested that other technological advances that have increased the carrying capacity of the world relative to humans are: [[polder]]s, [[fertilizer]], [[composting]], [[greenhouse]]s, [[land reclamation]], and [[fish farming]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} In an adverse way, however, many technologies enable economic entities and individual humans to inflict far more damage and eradication, far more quickly and efficiently on a wider-scale than ever. Examples include machine guns, chainsaws, earth-movers, and the capacity of industrialized fishing fleets to capture and harvest targeted fish species faster than the fish themselves can reproduce are examples of such problematic outcomes of technology.

[[Agricultural capability]] on Earth expanded in the last quarter of the 20th century. But now there are many projections of a continuation of the decline in world agricultural capability (and hence carrying capacity) which began in the 1990s. Most conspicuously, China's food production is forecast to decline by 37% by the last half of the 21st century, placing a strain on the entire carrying capacity of the world, as China's population could expand to about 1.5 billion people by the year 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Economy, E., ''China vs. Earth'', The Nation, May 7, 2007 issue&lt;/ref&gt; This reduction in China's agricultural capability (as in other world regions) is largely due to the world [[water crisis]] and especially due to mining [[groundwater]] beyond sustainable yield, which has been happening in China since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, R., ''The Little Green Handbook'', [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]], (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-312-42581-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lester Brown]] of the [[Earth Policy Institute]], has said: "It would take 1.5 Earths to sustain our present level of consumption. Environmentally, the world is in an [[overshoot (population)|overshoot]] mode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Ecological footprint===
One way to estimate human [[demand]] compared to ecosystem's carrying capacity is "[[ecological footprint]]" accounting. Rather than speculating about future possibilities and limitations imposed by carrying capacity constraints, Ecological Footprint accounting provides empirical, non-speculative assessments of the past. It compares historic regeneration rates, [[biocapacity]], against historical human [[demand]], [[ecological footprint]], in the same year.&lt;ref name="WS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wackernagel | first1 = M. | last2 = Schulz | first2 = N.B. | display-authors = etal |year=2002 |title="Tracking the ecological overshoot of the human economy |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/14/9266.short |journal=[[PNAS|Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA]] | volume = 99 | issue = 14| pages = 9266–9271 | doi=10.1073/pnas.142033699 | pmid=12089326 | pmc=123129| bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.9266W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, W.E. and Wackernagel, M., ''Ecological Footprints and Appropriated Carrying Capacity: Measuring the Natural Capital Requirements of the Human Economy'', Jansson, A., Folke, C., Hammer, M. and Costanza R. (ed.), [[Island Press]], (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; One result shows that humanity's demand footprint in 1999 exceeded the planet's bio-capacity by &gt;20%.&lt;ref name="WS" /&gt; However, this measurement does not take into account the depletion of the actual fossil fuels, "which would result in a carbon Footprint many hundreds of times higher than the current calculation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/frequently_asked_technical_questions/|title=FAQ - Global Footprint Network|author=|date=|website=footprintnetwork.org|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also concern of the ability of countries around to globe to decrease and maintain their ecological footprints. Holden and Linnerud, scholars working to provide a better framework that adequately judge sustainability development and maintenance in policy making, have generated a diagram that measures the global position of different countries around the world, which shows a linear relation between GDP PPP and ecological foot print in 2007. Possible answers to the question of where we are as individual countries attempting to reach sustainability and development methods to reduce ecological foot print. According to the Figure 1 diagram, the United States had the largest ecological foot print per capita along with Norway, Sweden, and Austria, in comparison to Cuba, Bangladesh, and Korea. &lt;ref name="The Sustainable Development Area"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holden|first1=Erling|last2=Linnerud|first2=Kristin|title=The sustainable development area: satisfying basic needs and safeguarding ecological sustainability|journal=Sustainable Development|date=May 2007|volume=15|issue=3|pages=174–187|doi=10.1002/sd.313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chord length definition (en).svg|right|thumb|400px|Chord of an aerofoil section.]]
[[Image:Aircraft chord.svg|right|thumb|400px|Chords on a swept-wing]]
In [[aeronautics]], a '''chord''' is the imaginary straight line joining the leading and trailing edges of an [[aerofoil]].  The ''chord length'' is the distance between the [[trailing edge]] and the point on the leading edge where the chord intersects the [[leading edge]].&lt;ref name=Clancy5.2&gt;[[L. J. Clancy]] (1975), ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.2, Pitman Publishing Limited, London. {{ISBN|0-273-01120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="houghton&amp;carpenter"/&gt;

The point on the leading edge that is used to define the chord can be defined as either the surface point of minimum radius,&lt;ref name="houghton&amp;carpenter"&gt;{{cite book | title=Aerodynamics for Engineering Students |author1=Houghton, E. L. |author2=Carpenter, P.W. | edition=5th | year=2003 | editor=Butterworth Heinmann | isbn=0-7506-5111-3}} p.18&lt;/ref&gt; or the surface point that will yield maximum chord length{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

The [[wing]], [[horizontal stabilizer]], [[vertical stabilizer]] and [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] of an aircraft are all based on aerofoil sections, and the term ''chord'' or ''chord length'' is also used to describe their width.  The chord of a wing, stabilizer and propeller is determined by measuring the distance between leading and trailing edges in the direction of the airflow.  (If a wing has a rectangular [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]], rather than tapered or swept, then the chord is simply the width of the wing measured in the direction of airflow.)  The term ''chord'' is also applied to the width of [[Flap (aircraft)|wing flaps]], [[ailerons]] and [[rudder]] on an aircraft.

The term is also applied to aerofoils in [[gas turbine]] engines such as [[turbojet]], [[turboprop]], or [[turbofan]] engines for aircraft propulsion.

Most wings are not rectangular so they have a different '''chord''' at different positions along their [[Wingspan|span]].  To give a characteristic figure that can be compared among various wing shapes, the ''mean aerodynamic chord'', or ''MAC'', is used. The MAC is somewhat more complex to calculate, because most wings vary in '''chord''' over the span, growing narrower towards the outer tips. This means that more [[lift (force)|lift]] is generated on the wider inner portions, and the MAC moves the point to measure the chord to take this into account.

==Standard mean chord==
Standard mean chord (SMC) is defined as wing area divided by wing span:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/818173505|title=Flight dynamics principles : a linear systems approach to aircraft stability and control|last=V.|first=Cook, M.|date=2013|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=9780080982427|edition=3rd|location=Waltham, MA|oclc=818173505}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2008}}

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{SMC} = \frac{S}{b},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''S'' is the wing area and ''b'' is the span of the wing. Thus, the SMC is the chord of a rectangular wing with the same area and span as those of the given wing. This is a purely geometric figure and is rarely used in [[aerodynamics]].

==Mean aerodynamic chord==
Mean aerodynamic chord (MAC) is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, I.H., and Von Doenhoff, A.E. (1959), ''Theory of Wing Sections'', Section 1.4 (page 27), Dover Publications Inc., New York, Standard Book Number 486-60586-8&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{MAC} = \frac{2}{S}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\frac{b}{2}}c^2 dy,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''y'' is the coordinate along the wing span and ''c'' is the chord at the coordinate ''y''. Other terms are as for SMC.

The MAC is a two-dimensional representation of the whole wing. The pressure distribution over the entire wing can be reduced to a single lift force on and a moment around the [[aerodynamic center]] of the MAC. Therefore, not only the length but also the position of MAC is often important. In particular, the position of [[center of gravity]] (CG) of an aircraft is usually measured relative to the MAC, as the percentage of the distance from the leading edge of MAC to CG with respect to MAC itself.

Note that the figure to the right implies that the MAC occurs at a point where leading or trailing edge sweep changes. In general, this is not the case. Any shape other than a simple trapezoid requires evaluation of the above integral.

The ratio of the length (or ''span'') of a rectangular-planform wing to its chord is known as the [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]], an important indicator of the [[lift-induced drag]] the wing will create.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode, A.C. (1972), ''Mechanics of Flight'', Chapter 3, (p.103, eighth edition), Pitman Publishing Limited, London {{ISBN|0-273-31623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For wings with planforms that are not rectangular, the aspect ratio is calculated as the square of the span divided by the wing planform area.) Wings with higher aspect ratios will have less induced drag than wings with lower aspect ratios. Induced drag is most significant at low airspeeds. This is why [[Glider aircraft|glider]]s have long slender wings.

==Tapered wing==
Knowing the area (S&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;), taper ratio (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) and the span (b) of the wing, the chord at any position on the span can be calculated by the formula:&lt;ref&gt;Ruggeri, M.C., (2009), ''Aerodinámica Teórica'', Apuntes de la materia, UTN-FRH, Haedo, Buenos Aires&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c(y)=\frac{2\,S_w}{(1+\lambda)b}\left[1-\frac{1-\lambda}{b}|y|\right],&lt;/math&gt;
where

&lt;math&gt;\lambda=\frac{C_{\rm Tip}}{C_{\rm Root}}&lt;/math&gt;

NOTE: This formula only works if y=0 is the port wingtip and y=b is the starboard wingtip. Typically, y=0 represents the midspan location.

Note 2: The formula as presented does not work regardless of whether one uses y = 0 -&gt; port tip or not, and the note is not consistent with the use of the absolute value of y in the formula.  The formula should read

:&lt;math&gt;c(y)=\frac{2\,S_w}{(1+\lambda)b}\left[1-\frac{1-\lambda}{b}|2 y|\right],&lt;/math&gt;

'''Clinical professor''', also known as '''professor of practice''', is an [[Academic rank|academic appointment]] made to a member of a profession who is associated with a [[university]] and engages in practical instruction of [[professional student]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcg.edu/faculty/facman/fadpt/clinicaladjunct.html CLINICAL AND ADJUNCT FACULTY APPOINTMENT POLICY] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213071737/http://www.mcg.edu/faculty/facman/fadpt/clinicaladjunct.html |date=December 13, 2010 }}, [[Medical College of Georgia]] Faculty Manual.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8897">A '''coupled human–environment system''' (known also as a '''coupled human and natural system''', or '''CHANS''') characterizes the dynamical two-way interactions between human systems (e.g., economic, social) and natural (e.g., hydrologic, atmospheric, biological, geological) systems.&lt;ref&gt;  [https://www.nsf.gov/geo/ere/ereweb/fundlisting.cfm?09560946044805114F1D4B14474914  Environmental Resource and Education Funding Opportunities], National Science Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marina11"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1890/0012-9623-92.2.218 |title=Research on Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS): Approach, Challenges, and Strategies |journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=218–28 |year=2011 |last1=Alberti |first1=Marina |last2=Asbjornsen |first2=Heidi |last3=Baker |first3=Lawrence A |last4=Brozovic |first4=Nicholas |last5=Drinkwater |first5=Laurie E |last6=Drzyzga |first6=Scott A |last7=Jantz |first7=Claire A |last8=Fragoso |first8=José |last9=Holland |first9=Daniel S |last10=Kohler |first10=Timothy (Tim) A |last11=Liu |first11=Jianguo (Jack) |last12=McConnell |first12=William J |last13=Maschner |first13=Herbert D.

As CHANS research is relatively new, it has not yet matured into a coherent field. Some research programs draw from, and build on, the perspectives developed in trans-discplinary fields such as [[human ecology]], [[ecological anthropology]], [[environmental geography]], [[ecological economics|economics]], as well as others. In contrast, other research programs aim to develop a more quantitative theoretic framework focusing on the development of analytical and numerical models, by building on theoretical advances in [[complex adaptive systems]], [[complexity economics]], [[dynamical system]]s theory, and the [[earth science]]s. To some extent, all CHANS programs recognize the need to move beyond traditional research methods developed in the social and natural sciences, as these are not sufficient to quantify the highly nonlinear dynamics often present in CHANS. Some research into CHANS emulates the more traditional research programs that tended to separate the social from the ecological sciences.&lt;ref name="Liu07"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[639:chans]2.0.co;2 |jstor=25547831 |pmid=18240679 |title=Coupled Human and Natural Systems |journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=639–49 |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=Jianguo |last2=Dietz |first2=Thomas |last3=Carpenter |first3=Stephen R |last4=Folke |first4=Carl |last5=Alberti |first5=Marina |last6=Redman |first6=Charles L |last7=Schneider |first7=Stephen H |last8=Ostrom |first8=Elinor |last9=Pell |first9=Alice N |last10=Lubchenco |first10=Jane |last11=Taylor |first11=William W |last12=Ouyang |first12=Zhiyun |last13=Deadman |first13=Peter |last14=Kratz |first14=Timothy |last15=Provencher |first15=William }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu07b"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1144004 |pmid=17872436 |title=Complexity of Coupled Human and Natural Systems |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5844 |pages=1513–6 |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=J |last2=Dietz |first2=T |last3=Carpenter |first3=S.

==History==
The phrase "coupled human–environment systems" appears in the earlier literature (dating back to 1999) noting that social and natural systems are inseparable.&lt;ref name="Sheppard04"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Sheppard | editor1-first=E. | editor2-last=McMaster | editor2-first=R.

Funding by the [[National Science Foundation]] to study "Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems" occurred from 2001-2005 as a part of a "special competition" within the "Biocomplexity in the environment" program, and in 2007 gained formal standing. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nsf.gov/news/priority_areas/biocomplexity/index.jsp{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14601/nsf14601.htm{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Spins aren't necessarily dangerous.  Also "departed" flight isn't uncontrollable, just less controllable.  F-16 deep stall and Cessna 150 spin are both maneuvers where there is enough controllability  to get back to "normal" controlled flight.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1250">'''Departure resistance''' is a quality of an [[aircraft]] which enables it to remain in controlled flight and resist entering potentially dangerous less-controlled maneuvers such as [[spin (flight)|spin]].

Depending on its design, an aircraft may be more or less likely to leave (depart from) controlled flight when the [[aircraft pilot|pilot]] applies extreme control inputs. Good departure resistance characteristics allow the pilot to remain in control of the aircraft in such situations.

Departure resistance is considered to contribute more towards flight safety than ''departure recovery''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peter2000.co.uk/aviation/misc/3-105960-Cirrusstall-spinreport.pdf Cirrus Design SR 20 Equivalent of safety for Spin requirement]&lt;/ref&gt; Departure recovery is the ability of an aircraft to return to controlled flight once in a certain uncontrolled maneuver. Being able to [[Spin_(flight)#Entry and recovery|recover from spin]] is an example of departure recovery.

'''Ford Sync''' (stylized '''Ford SYNC''') is a factory-installed, integrated [[in-car communications and entertainment system|in-vehicle communications and entertainment system]] that allows users to make hands-free telephone calls, control music and perform other functions with the use of voice commands.{{Sfn|About SYNC|2010}}{{Sfn|Microsoft|2010|p=17}} The system consists of applications and user interfaces developed by [[Ford]] and other third-party developers. The first two generations (Ford Sync and [[MyFord Touch]]) run on the [[Windows Embedded Automotive]] operating system designed by [[Microsoft]],{{Sfn|Microsoft|2010|p=16}} while the third generation ([[Sync 3]]) currently runs on the [[QNX]] operating system from [[BlackBerry Limited]].&lt;ref name="Sync 3"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2014/12/11/ford-sync-3/20234131/ Ford dumps Microsoft for Blackberry for Sync 3] ''[[USA Today]]'' (12/11/2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford first announced the release of SYNC in January 2007 at the [[Detroit]] International Auto Show.{{Sfn|Moran|2007-01-08}} SYNC was released into the retail market in 2007 when Ford installed the technology in twelve Ford group vehicles (2008 model) in North America.{{Sfn|AutomotiveWorld.com|2007}}

== Overview ==
Ford president and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Alan Mulally]] and [[Microsoft]] chairman [[Bill Gates]] announced the SYNC partnership between Ford and Microsoft at the annual [[North American International Auto Show]] in January 2007.{{Sfn|Moran|2007-01-08}}

The Ford SYNC technology was promoted as a new product that provided drivers with the ability to operate [[Bluetooth]]-enabled [[mobile phone]]s and [[portable media player|digital media players]] in their vehicles using [[Voice command device|voice commands]], the vehicle's [[steering wheel]], and [[Car radio#Common components and terms|radio controls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autotrends.org/is-ford-sync-the-voice-recognition-benchmark/ | title= Is Ford SYNC The Voice Recognition Benchmark? |date=2008-04-21 |accessdate=2008-08-05 |work=Auto Trends}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, new technology was added to SYNC in which [[Text messaging|text messages]] received by the driver are "[[Speech production|vocalized]]" by a [[Digitizing|digitized]] female voice device named "Samantha". SYNC's text message function also has the ability to interpret approximately one hundred shorthand messages, such as "[[LOL]]", and will read "swear words", but does not decipher acronyms that have been considered by the designers to be "obscene".

In 2007, as a [[wikt:standalone|standalone]] option, the [[suggested retail price]] for the SYNC was [[United States Dollar|US$]]395.{{Sfn|Popular Mechanics|2007}}

== Compatibility ==
Certain voice commands, such as "Turn-by-turn directions", "Vehicle Health Report", "Weather" and climate control commands are not available in some countries such as [[Canada]] due to compatibility issues.  For example, many commands are not available because there is no [[French Language|French]] equivalent for a command in [[English Language|English]].
[[Ford Canada]] expects to address these issues in upcoming versions of the software after the issues are worked out in detail, but there does not appear to be a firm release date.

=== Mobile-integration ===
SYNC has various mobile-integration capabilities, including "Push to Talk" on the [[steering wheel]], wireless transfer of contacts between a mobile phone and the on-board phone book, as well as various advanced calling features, such as [[caller ID]], [[call waiting]], [[conference calling]], a caller log, a list of contacts, a [[signal strength]] icon, and a phone battery charge icon. Personal ring tones can also be assigned to identify specific callers.

==== Audible SMS messages ====
SYNC can convert a user's [[SMS]] messages to audio and read them out loud to the user through the vehicle's speaker system. This feature is carrier dependent as well as dependent on the device of the user. The feature is supported by several phone operating systems, including the [[iPhone]], most [[Android (operating system)|Android]] models, and [[Windows Mobile]]. This feature is also dependent on the phone support Bluetooth Message Access Profile.

=== Entertainment ===

==== Digital music player support ====
SYNC can connect to popular digital music players via Bluetooth or a USB connection. Users can browse through music collections by genre, album, artist, and song title using voice commands. With certain devices, SYNC is also capable of playing protected content (for example [[Zune]] Pass downloads), provided that usage rights on the device are current.

=== Multilingual intelligence ===
SYNC is fluent in American [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and Brazilian [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].{{Sfn|Nunez|2007-01-07}}

== Applications ==

=== 911 Assist ===
The 911 Assist application places a direct call to a local 911 emergency operator in the event of a serious accident with an air bag deployment.  Before initiating the emergency 911 call, SYNC will provide a 10-second window to allow the driver or passenger to decide whether to cancel the call. If not manually cancelled within the 10-second window, SYNC will place the emergency call. A pre-recorded message will play when the call is answered, and occupants in the vehicle will then be able to communicate directly with the 911 operator.

=== AppLink ===

=== Traffic, Directions and Information ===
Traffic, Directions and Information is an application that provides the user with traffic alerts, turn-by-turn directions and information about topics such as weather, sports, news and 411 business search. Ford announced on May 27, 2009 that the Traffic, Directions and Information application would be free for three years to the original owner of 2010 model year SYNC equipped vehicles. The information for traffic alerts and Turn-By-Turn Directions are provided by [[INRIX]] and [[Telenav]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://betanews.com/2009/01/09/ford-sync-gets-navigation-tools-from-telenav/|title=Ford SYNC gets navigation tools from Telenav|date=9 January 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vehicle Health Reports ===
Ford has discontinued support for the Vehicle Health Report.  According to the published service bulletin, "Ford has made the necessary decision to discontinue the Vehicle Health Report service for SYNC GEN1 &amp; GEN2 available on 2008-2016 vehicles. Consistent with the Terms &amp; Conditions in the user agreement and starting August 1st, 2018, this change will result in the following:

Vehicle Health Information will no longer be sent through the mobile phone associated with the registered e-mail account
Vehicle Health Reports will no longer be sent via e-mail
Vehicle Health Reports will no longer be available on the Ford/Lincoln Owner websites"

=== Ford Work Solutions ===
The Ford Work Solution is a collection of technologies debuted in April 2009. Ford Work Solutions is marketed towards professionals who buy the [[Ford F150]], F-Series Super Duty, E-Series van and Transit Connect.{{Sfn|Ford|2009-09}} [[Magneti Marelli]] developed the in-dash computer system that is unique to trucks equipped with Ford Work Solutions.{{Sfn|Ford|2009-03-03}} The applications included in the Ford Work Solution are Crew Chief, Garmin Nav, Mobile Office and Tool Link.{{Sfn|Microsoft|2010|p=16}}

==== Crew Chief ====
The Crew Chief application provides real time vehicle location and maintenance tracking. Crew Chief can monitor numerous vehicle diagnostic functions including tire pressure, water in fuel, airbag faults and the check engine light. Users can also create alerts to monitor things such as excessive speeding.{{Sfn|Ford|2009-09}}

==== Garmin Navigation ====
The [[Garmin]] Navigation application provides capabilities including destination routing and locating points of interest.{{Sfn|Ford|2009-09}}

==== LogMeIn ====
The LogMeIn application allows users to remotely access an office computer using a data connection provided by [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]].{{Sfn|Ford|2009-03-03}} The user can open applications on the remote computer, make updates and print documents using a Ford-certified, Bluetooth-enabled keyboard and printer.{{Sfn|Ford|2009-09}}

==== Tool Link ====
Tool Link is an application that enables a user to take physical inventory of objects present in the truck bed using [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) tags. A user attaches RFID tags to an object, allowing the SYNC system to detect the object's presence or absence and noting the object's status on the in-dash computer display.{{Sfn|Microsoft|2009-03-09}}

Users can create "job lists" of objects to verify that tools needed for a certain job are present in the truck before heading to a job site. At the end of the job, the system can inventory items in the truck to ensure that no tools are left on the job site.{{Sfn|Microsoft|2009-03-09}} Ford developed the Tool Link application with power tool manufacturer [[DeWalt]] along with ThingMagic.{{Sfn|Ford|2009-09}}{{Sfn|Microsoft|2009-03-09}}

== Agreement with Microsoft ==
Ford had exclusive use of the Microsoft Auto embedded operating system that powered the early versions of SYNC until the exclusivity agreement expired in November 2008. The Ford-developed user interface elements and Ford-developed applications remain exclusive to Ford group vehicles and are not available to other manufacturers using Windows Embedded Automotive for the basis of their in-vehicle infotainment systems.{{Sfn|Tutor|2009-09-17}}

== SYNC versions ==
The original SYNC system (before the introduction of MyFord Touch) is now known as "SYNC Gen1", while the new [[MyFord Touch]] and [[MyLincoln Touch]] systems are known as "Gen2".

=== SYNC Gen1, Sept. 2007-Nov. 2012 ===
SYNC v1, which debuted September 2007, offered the ability to play certain entertainment media, the ability to connect to certain mobile phones and digital audio players and to utilize [[SMS]].{{Sfn|Microsoft|2010|p=16}} In January 2008, SYNC v2 was released, which enabled two new Ford developed applications: 911 Assist and Vehicle Health Report.{{Sfn|Microsoft|2010|p=16}} SYNC v3, released in April 2009, enabled the Traffic, Directions and Information application. Later that month, Ford Work Solutions, a collection of five applications marketed towards professionals who buy Ford trucks, was added. The applications included in the Ford Work Solution were Crew Chief, Garmin Nav, LogMeIn and Tool Link.{{Sfn|Microsoft|2010|p=16}}{{Sfn|Microsoft|2010|p=16}} SYNC v4 and v5 were released in January 2010 and January 2011, respectively, and enabled the Ford developed MyFord Touch application for certain 2011 model year vehicles as well as SYNC AppLink capabilities for certain 2011 model year vehicles.{{Sfn|Microsoft|2010|p=16}} The latest version of SYNC was released in November 2012 by Ford and is only applicable to certain vehicles and configurations.
&lt;!--Copy edited to this point--&gt;

Ford has extended the warranty for Sync on several 2011 to 2014 models to five years as a customer satisfaction matter. (Field Service Action Number: 12M02)&lt;ref&gt;https://ford.oemdtc.com/1745/12m02-warranty-extension-covering-accessory-protocol-interface-module-apim-software-and-hardware-2011-2014-ford-lincoln&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MyFord Touch ===
{{Main|MyFord Touch}}

=== Sync 3 ===
On December 11, 2014, Ford announced [[Sync 3]], which will replace MyFord Touch, will have simpler features and will be powered by [[QNX]] software by [[BlackBerry Limited]] instead of Microsoft.&lt;ref name="Sync 3" /&gt; The Sync 3 name will be used for both Ford and Lincoln models, though Lincoln's will have a different theme. Over half of Ford's North American vehicles will have Sync 3 by the end of 2015 and will be expanded globally afterwards; vehicles not equipped with Sync 3 will be equipped with the original Ford Sync.&lt;ref name="Sync 3" /&gt; Ford cited issues with Microsoft's complex software dragging down its scores with [[Consumer Reports]] and other consumer magazines being a reason it switched to the BlackBerry [[QNX]] operating system.&lt;ref name="Sync 3" /&gt;

== System hardware ==
[[File:Ford SYNC module FCCID LHJSYNC01 top of circuit board.jpg|thumb|200px|Ford SYNC module circuit board FCCID LHJSYNC01]] The SYNC computer, which Ford calls the Accessory Protocol Interface Module (APIM), is housed separately from the [[head unit]],  called the Audio Control Module (ACM), and interfaces with all vehicle audio sources as well as the high-speed and medium-speed vehicle [[CAN-bus]]es.{{Sfn|Mustang Sync Kit|2008|p=2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Connector: C3342 Accessory Protocol Interface Module (APIM)|url=http://www.edge-central.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=20&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;start=30|publisher=Ford Motor Company|accessdate=2010-07-30}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation of the Ford's SYNC computer was designed in cooperation with [[Continental AG]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bray|first=Hiawatha|title=Microsoft, Ford team up on voice controls for drivers|url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/11/12/microsoft_ford_team_up_on_voice_controls_for_drivers/|accessdate=21 August 2010|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is built around a 400&amp;nbsp;MHz Freescale i.MX31L processor with an [[ARM architecture|ARM]] 11 CPU core, uses 256&amp;nbsp;MB of 133&amp;nbsp;MHz Mobile [[DDR SDRAM]] from [[Micron Technology|Micron]] and 2&amp;nbsp;GB of Samsung NAND [[flash memory]],&lt;ref name="iSuppli teardown summary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Under the Hood: Mini-teardown reveals Ford Sync's economical design|url=http://www.embedded-systems.com/underthehood/207100029|publisher=Embedded.com|accessdate=2010-07-30|author=Richard Robinson, iSuppli|date=2008-04-04|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69uV54IyL?url=http://eetimes.com/design/automotive-design/4011415/Mini-teardown-reveals-Ford-Sync-s-economical-design|archive-date=2012-08-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chaney|first=Rich|title=Mobile DDR spurs low-cost, low-power automotive electronics designs|url=http://www.eetimes.com/design/automotive-design/4011428/Mobile-DDR-spurs-low-cost-low-power-automotive-electronics-designs?pageNumber=1|publisher=EETimes, Micron Technology|accessdate=21 August 2010|date=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; runs the [[Windows Embedded Automotive]] operating system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-12760_7-9672096-5.html|title=Ford and Microsoft in Sync for in-car infotainment|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses speech technology by [[Nuance Communications]]. Utilizing the USB port, SYNC's Microsoft Windows Auto-based operating system can be updated to work with new personal electronic devices.  A [[Cambridge Silicon Radio]] (CSR) BlueCore4 chip provides [[Bluetooth]] connectivity with compatible phones and devices. SYNC's major circuit board [[integrated circuits|chips]] cost roughly US$27.80, which allows Ford to profitably sell the system at a much lower price than competitive offerings.&lt;ref name="iSuppli teardown summary" /&gt;

== Research ==
In 2011, Shutko and Tijerina reviewed large naturalistic studies on cars (Dingus and Klauer, 2008; Klauer et al., 2006; Young and Schreiner, 2009), heavy good vehicles (Olsen at el, 2008) and commercial vehicles and buses (Hickman et al., 2010) in field operational tests (Sayer et al., 2005, 2007), and concluded that:
* Most of the collisions and near-misses that occur involve inattention as a contributing factor;
* Visual inattention – that is, looking away from the road scene – is the single most significant factor contributing to crash and near-crash involvement;
* Cognitive distraction associated with listening to or talking on a handheld or hands-free device is associated with real world crashes and near-miss events to a lesser extent than is commonly believed, and such distractions may even enhance safety in some instances.&lt;ref&gt;Shutko, J. and Tijerina, L., (2011), ''Ford's Approach to Managing Driver Attention: SYNC and MyFord Touch'', Ergonomics In Design, Vol. 19, No. 4, October 2011, pp. 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and recognition ==
* ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' ranked SYNC number four on its list of the "Top 10 Most Brilliant Gadgets of 2007".{{Sfn|Popular Mechanics|2007}}
* ''[[Popular Science]]'' magazine awarded SYNC a "Best of What's New Award" for 2008 in November 2007.{{Sfn|Popular Science|2007}}

A '''fuzzy control system''' is a [[control system]] based on [[fuzzy logic]]—a [[mathematics|mathematical]] system that analyzes [[analog signal|analog]] input values in terms of  [[mathematical logic|logic]]al variables that take on continuous values between 0 and 1, in contrast to classical or [[Digital data|digital]] logic, which operates on discrete values of either 1 or 0 (true or false, respectively).&lt;ref name = "Pedrycz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pedrycz|first1=Witold|title=Fuzzy control and fuzzy systems|year=1993|publisher=Research Studies Press Ltd.|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hájek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hájek|first1=Petr|title=Metamathematics of fuzzy logic|year=1998|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Fuzzy logic is widely used in machine control. The term  "fuzzy" refers to the fact that the logic involved can deal with concepts that cannot be expressed as the "true" or "false" but rather as "partially true".  Although alternative approaches such as genetic algorithms and neural networks can perform just as well as fuzzy logic in many cases, fuzzy logic has the advantage that the solution to the problem can be cast in terms that human operators can understand, so that their experience can be used in the design of the controller.  This makes it easier to mechanize tasks that are already successfully performed by humans.&lt;ref name = "Pedrycz" /&gt;

== History and applications ==
Fuzzy logic was first proposed by [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]] of the University of California at Berkeley in a 1965 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0019-9958(65)90241-X| title = Fuzzy sets| journal = Information and Control| volume = 8| issue = 3| pages = 338–353| year = 1965| last1 = Zadeh | first1 = Lotfi A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated on his ideas in a 1973 paper that introduced the concept of "linguistic variables", which in this article equates to a variable defined as a fuzzy set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/TSMC.1973.5408575| title = Outline of a new approach to the analysis of complex systems and decision processes| journal = IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics| volume = 1| pages = 28–44| year = 1973| last1 = Zadeh | first1 = Lotfi A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research followed, with the first industrial application, a cement [[kiln]] built in Denmark, coming on line in 1975.

Fuzzy systems were initially implemented in [[Japan]].

* Interest in fuzzy systems was sparked by Seiji Yasunobu and Soji Miyamoto of [[Hitachi]], who in 1985 provided simulations that demonstrated the feasibility of fuzzy control systems for the [[Sendai Subway]]. Their ideas were adopted, and fuzzy systems were used to control accelerating, braking, and stopping when the [[Sendai Subway Namboku Line|Namboku Line]] opened in 1987.
* In 1987, Takeshi Yamakawa demonstrated the use of fuzzy control, through a set of simple dedicated fuzzy logic chips, in an "[[inverted pendulum]]" experiment. This is a classic control problem, in which a vehicle tries to keep a pole mounted on its top by a hinge upright by moving back and forth. Yamakawa subsequently made the demonstration more sophisticated by mounting a wine glass containing water and even a live mouse to the top of the pendulum: the system maintained stability in both cases. Yamakawa eventually went on to organize his own fuzzy-systems research lab to help exploit his patents in the field.
* Japanese engineers subsequently developed a wide range of fuzzy systems for both industrial and consumer applications. In 1988 Japan established the Laboratory for International Fuzzy Engineering (LIFE), a cooperative arrangement between 48 companies to pursue fuzzy research. The automotive company Volkswagen was the only foreign corporate member of LIFE, dispatching a researcher for a duration of three years.
* Japanese consumer goods often incorporate fuzzy systems. Matsushita vacuum cleaners use microcontrollers running fuzzy algorithms to interrogate dust sensors and adjust [[suction power]] accordingly. Hitachi washing machines use fuzzy controllers to load-weight, fabric-mix, and dirt sensors and automatically set the wash cycle for the best use of power, water, and detergent.
* Canon developed an [[autofocus]]ing camera that uses a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) to measure the clarity of the image in six regions of its field of view and use the information provided to determine if the image is in focus. It also tracks the rate of change of lens movement during focusing, and controls its speed to prevent overshoot. The camera's fuzzy control system uses 12 inputs: 6 to obtain the current clarity data provided by the CCD and 6 to measure the rate of change of lens movement. The output is the position of the lens. The fuzzy control system uses 13 rules and requires 1.1 kilobytes of memory.
*An industrial [[air conditioner]] designed by Mitsubishi uses 25 heating rules and 25 cooling rules. A temperature sensor provides input, with control outputs fed to an [[inverter (logic gate)|inverter]], a compressor valve, and a fan motor. Compared to the previous design, the fuzzy controller heats and cools five times faster, reduces power consumption by 24%, increases temperature stability by a factor of two, and uses fewer sensors.
* Other applications investigated or implemented include: character and handwriting recognition; optical fuzzy systems; robots, including one for making Japanese flower arrangements; [[voice control|voice-controlled]] robot helicopters (hovering is a "balancing act" rather similar to the inverted pendulum problem); rehabilitation robotics to provide patient-specific solutions (e.g. to control heart rate and blood pressure &lt;ref name = "sarabadani"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TBME.2015.2391234 |title=Real-time closed-loop control of human heart rate and blood pressure|year=2015 |last1=Sarabadani Tafreshi |first1=Amirehsan |journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering|volume=62 |issue=5 |pages=1434–1442 |pmid=25594957 |last2=Klamroth-Marganska|first2=V. |last3=Nussbaumer |first3=S.|last4=Riener|first4=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;); control of flow of powders in film manufacture; elevator systems; and so on.

Work on fuzzy systems is also proceeding in the United State and Europe, although on a less extensive scale than in Japan.

* The [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] has investigated fuzzy control for [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] motors, and [[NASA]] has studied fuzzy control for automated space docking: simulations show that a fuzzy control system can greatly reduce fuel consumption.
* Firms such as [[Boeing]], [[General Motors]], [[Allen-Bradley]], [[Chrysler]], [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]], and [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]] have worked on fuzzy logic for use in low-power refrigerators, improved automotive transmissions, and energy-efficient electric motors.
* In 1995 [[Maytag]] introduced an "intelligent" [[dishwasher]] based on a fuzzy controller and a "one-stop sensing module" that combines a [[thermistor]], for temperature measurement; a conductivity sensor, to measure detergent level from the ions present in the wash; a turbidity sensor that measures scattered and transmitted light to measure the soiling of the wash; and a magnetostrictive sensor to read spin rate. The system determines the optimum wash cycle for any load to obtain the best results with the least amount of energy, detergent, and water. It even adjusts for dried-on foods by tracking the last time the door was opened, and estimates the number of dishes by the number of times the door was opened.

Research and development is also continuing on fuzzy applications in software, as opposed to [[firmware]], design, including fuzzy [[expert system]]s and integration of fuzzy logic with [[artificial neural network|neural-network]] and so-called adaptive "[[genetic algorithm|genetic]]" software systems, with the ultimate goal of building "self-learning" fuzzy-control systems.&lt;ref name="mamdani"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mamdani|first1=Ebrahim H|title=Application of fuzzy algorithms for control of simple dynamic plant|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Electrical Engineers|year=1974|volume=121|issue=12|pages=1585–1588|doi=10.1049/piee.1974.0328}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems can be employed to control complex, nonlinear dynamic plants, for example, human body.&lt;ref name = "sarabadani" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "mamdani" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bastian|first1=Andreas|title=Identifying fuzzy models utilizing genetic programming|journal=Fuzzy sets and systems|year=2000|volume=113|issue=3|pages=333–350|doi=10.1016/S0165-0114(98)00086-4|url=http://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/pdf/specific/articulo/science2_27.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuzzy sets ==
{{see also|fuzzy set}}
{{unbalanced|section|date=April 2011}}
The input variables in a fuzzy control system are in general mapped by sets of membership functions similar to this, known as "fuzzy sets". The process of converting a crisp input value to a fuzzy value is called "fuzzification".

A control system may also have various types of [[switch]], or "ON-OFF", inputs along with its analog inputs, and such switch inputs of course will always have a truth value equal to either 1 or 0, but the scheme can deal with them as simplified fuzzy functions that happen to be either one value or another.

Given "[[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]s" of input variables into membership functions and [[truth value]]s, the [[microcontroller]] then [[decision making|makes decisions]] for what action to take, based on a set of "rules", each of the form:

   IF brake temperature IS warm AND speed IS not very fast 
   THEN brake pressure IS slightly decreased.

In this example, the two input variables are "brake temperature" and "speed" that have values defined as fuzzy sets. The output variable, "brake pressure" is also defined by a fuzzy set that can have values like "static" or "slightly increased" or "slightly decreased" etc.

This rule by itself is very puzzling since it looks like it could be used without bothering with fuzzy logic, but remember that the decision is based on a set of rules:

* All the rules that apply are invoked, using the membership functions and truth values obtained from the inputs, to determine the result of the rule.
* This result in turn will be mapped into a membership function and truth value controlling the output variable.
* These results are combined to give a specific ("crisp") answer, the actual brake pressure, a procedure known as "[[defuzzification]]".

This combination of fuzzy operations and [[Rule-based system|rule-based]] "[[inference]]" describes a "fuzzy expert system".

Traditional control systems are based on mathematical models in which the control system is described using one or more [[differential equation]]s that define the system response to its inputs. Such systems are often implemented as "PID controllers" ([[PID controller|proportional-integral-derivative controllers]]). They are the products of decades of development and theoretical analysis, and are highly effective.

If PID and other traditional control systems are so well-developed, why bother with fuzzy control? It has some advantages. In many cases, the mathematical model of the control process may not exist, or may be too "expensive" in terms of computer processing power and memory, and a system based on empirical rules may be more effective.

Furthermore, fuzzy logic is well suited to low-cost implementations based on cheap sensors, low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, and 4-bit or 8-bit one-chip microcontroller chips. Such systems can be easily upgraded by adding new rules to improve performance or add new features. In many cases, fuzzy control can be used to improve existing traditional controller systems by adding an extra layer of intelligence to the current control method.

=== Fuzzy control in detail ===
Fuzzy controllers are very simple conceptually. They consist of an input stage, a processing stage, and an output stage. The input stage maps sensor or other inputs, such as switches, thumbwheels, and so on, to the appropriate membership functions and truth values. The processing stage invokes each appropriate rule and generates a result for each, then combines the results of the rules. Finally, the output stage converts the combined result back into a specific control output value.

The most common shape of membership functions is triangular, although trapezoidal and bell curves are also used, but the shape is generally less important than the number of curves and their placement. From three to seven curves are generally appropriate to cover the required range of an input value, or the "[[universe of discourse]]" in fuzzy jargon.

As discussed earlier, the processing stage is based on a collection of logic rules in the form of IF-THEN statements, where the IF part is called the "antecedent" and the THEN part is called the "consequent". Typical fuzzy control systems have dozens of rules.

Consider a rule for a thermostat:

   IF (temperature is "cold") THEN turn (heater is "high")

This rule uses the truth value of the "temperature" input, which is some truth value of "cold", to generate a result in the fuzzy set for the "heater" output, which is some value of "high". This result is used with the results of other rules to finally generate the crisp composite output. Obviously, the greater the truth value of "cold", the higher the truth value of "high", though this does not necessarily mean that the output itself will be set to "high" since this is only one rule among many. 
In some cases, the membership functions can be modified by "hedges" that are equivalent to adverbs. Common hedges include "about", "near", "close to", "approximately", "very", "slightly", "too", "extremely", and "somewhat". These operations may have precise definitions, though the definitions can vary considerably between different implementations. "Very", for one example, squares membership functions; since the membership values are always less than 1, this narrows the membership function. "Extremely" cubes the values to give greater narrowing, while "somewhat" broadens the function by taking the square root.

In practice, the fuzzy rule sets usually have several antecedents that are combined using fuzzy operators, such as AND, OR, and NOT, though again the definitions tend to vary: AND, in one popular definition, simply uses the minimum weight of all the antecedents, while OR uses the maximum value. There is also a NOT operator that subtracts a membership function from 1 to give the "complementary" function.

There are several ways to define the result of a rule, but one of the most common and simplest is the "max-min" [[inference]] method, in which the output membership function is given the truth value generated by the premise.

Rules can be solved in parallel in hardware, or sequentially in software. The results of all the rules that have fired are "defuzzified" to a crisp value by one of several methods. There are dozens, in theory, each with various advantages or drawbacks.

The "centroid" method is very popular, in which the "center of mass" of the result provides the crisp value. Another approach is the "height" method, which takes the value of the biggest contributor. The centroid method favors the rule with the output of greatest area, while the height method obviously favors the rule with the greatest output value.

The diagram below demonstrates max-min inferencing and centroid defuzzification for a system with input variables "x", "y", and "z" and an output variable "n". Note that "mu" is standard fuzzy-logic nomenclature for "truth value":

[[File:Fuzzy control - centroid defuzzification using max-min inferencing.png]]

Notice how each rule provides a result as a truth value of a particular membership function for the output variable. In centroid defuzzification the values are OR'd, that is, the maximum value is used and values are not added, and the results are then combined using a centroid calculation.

Fuzzy control system design is based on empirical methods, basically a methodical approach to [[trial-and-error]]. The general process is as follows:

* Document the system's operational specifications and inputs and outputs.
* Document the fuzzy sets for the inputs.
* Document the rule set.
* Determine the defuzzification method.
* Run through test suite to validate system, adjust details as required.
* Complete document and release to production.

As a general example, consider the design of a fuzzy controller for a steam turbine. The block diagram of this control system appears as follows:

&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[File:fuzzy control block.png]] --&gt;

The input and output variables map into the following fuzzy set:

[[File:Fuzzy control - input and output variables mapped into a fuzzy set.png]]—where:

   N3:   Large negative.
   N2:   Medium negative.
   N1:   Small negative.
   Z:    Zero.
   P1:   Small positive.
   P2:   Medium positive.
   P3:   Large positive.

The rule set includes such rules as:

 rule 1:  IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS weak,   
          THEN throttle is P3.

 rule 2:  IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS low,    
          THEN throttle is P2.

 rule 3:  IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS ok,     
          THEN throttle is Z.

 rule 4:  IF temperature IS cool AND pressure IS strong, 
          THEN throttle is N2.

In practice, the controller accepts the inputs and maps them into their membership functions and truth values. These mappings are then fed into the rules. If the rule specifies an AND relationship between the mappings of the two input variables, as the examples above do, the minimum of the two is used as the combined truth value; if an OR is specified, the maximum is used. The appropriate output state is selected and assigned a membership value at the truth level of the premise. The truth values are then defuzzified. 
For an example, assume the temperature is in the "cool" state, and the pressure is in the "low" and "ok" states. The pressure values ensure that only rules 2 and 3 fire:

[[File:Fuzzy control - Rule 2 evaluation.png]]

[[File:Fuzzy control - Rule 3 evaluation.png]]

The two outputs are then defuzzified through centroid defuzzification:

The output value will adjust the throttle and then the control cycle will begin again to generate the next value .

=== Building a fuzzy controller ===
Consider implementing with a microcontroller chip a simple feedback controller:

[[File:Fuzzy control system-feedback controller.png]]

A fuzzy set is defined for the input error variable "e", and the derived change in error, "delta", as well as the "output", as follows:

   LP:  large positive
   SP:  small positive
   ZE:  zero
   SN:  small negative
   LN:  large negative

If the error ranges from -1 to +1, with the analog-to-digital converter used having a resolution of 0.25, then the input variable's fuzzy set (which, in this case, also applies to the output variable) can be described very simply as a table, with the error / delta / output values in the top row and the truth values for each membership function arranged in rows beneath:

   _______________________________________________________________________
 
               -1    -0.75  -0.5   -0.25    0     0.25   0.5    0.75    1

   _______________________________________________________________________            —or, in graphical form (where each "X" has a value of 0.1):

          LN           SN           ZE           SP           LP

       +------------------------------------------------------------------+

Suppose this fuzzy system has the following rule base:

   rule 1:  IF e = ZE AND delta = ZE THEN output = ZE
   rule 2:  IF e = ZE AND delta = SP THEN output = SN
   rule 3:  IF e = SN AND delta = SN THEN output = LP
   rule 4:  IF e = LP OR  delta = LP THEN output = LN

These rules are typical for control applications in that the antecedents consist of the logical combination of the error and error-delta signals, while the consequent is a control command output. 
The rule outputs can be defuzzified using a discrete centroid computation:

   SUM( I = 1 TO 4 OF ( mu(I) * output(I) ) ) / SUM( I = 1 TO 4 OF mu(I) )

Now, suppose that at a given time we have: 
   e     = 0.25
   delta = 0.5

Then this gives:

   ________________________
 
               e     delta
   ________________________
 
   mu(LP)      0      0.3
   mu(SP)     0.7      1
   mu(ZE)     0.7     0.3
   mu(SN)      0       0
   mu(LN)      0       0
   ________________________

Plugging this into rule 1 gives:

   rule 1:  IF e = ZE AND delta = ZE THEN output = ZE
  
      mu(1)     = MIN( 0.7, 0.3 ) = 0.3
      output(1) = 0

-- where:

* mu(1): Truth value of the result membership function for rule 1. In terms of a centroid calculation, this is the "mass" of this result for this discrete case.
* output(1):  Value (for rule 1) where the result membership function (ZE) is maximum over the output variable fuzzy set range. That is, in terms of a centroid calculation, the location of the "center of mass" for this individual result. This value is independent of the value of "mu". It simply identifies the location of ZE along the output range.

The other rules give:

   rule 2:  IF e = ZE AND delta = SP THEN output = SN
 
      mu(2)     = MIN( 0.7, 1 ) = 0.7   
      output(2) = -0.5

   rule 3: IF e = SN AND delta = SN THEN output = LP
 
      mu(3)     = MIN( 0.0, 0.0 ) = 0
      output(3) = 1

   rule 4: IF e = LP OR  delta = LP THEN output = LN
 
      mu(4)     = MAX( 0.0, 0.3 ) = 0.3
      output(4) = -1

The centroid computation yields:

   &lt;math&gt; \frac{mu(1) \cdot output(1)+mu(2) \cdot output(2)+mu(3) \cdot output(3)+mu(4) \cdot output(4)}{mu(1)+mu(2)+mu(3)+mu(4)} &lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt;=\frac{(0.3 \cdot 0)+(0.7 \cdot-0.5)+(0 \cdot 1) +(0.3 \cdot-1)}{0.3+0.7+0+0.3} &lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt;=-0.5&lt;/math&gt;—for the final control output. Simple. Of course the hard part is figuring out what rules actually work correctly in practice.

If you have problems figuring out the centroid equation, remember that a centroid is defined by summing all the moments (location times mass) around the center of gravity and equating the sum to zero. So if &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; is the center of gravity, &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; is the location of each mass, and &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; is each mass, this gives:

   &lt;math&gt;0 = ( X_1 - X_0 ) \cdot M_1 + ( X_2 - X_0 ) \cdot M_2 + \ldots + ( X_n - X_0 ) \cdot M_n&lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt;0 = ( X_1 \cdot M_1 + X_2 \cdot M_2 + \ldots + X_n \cdot M_n ) - X_0 \cdot ( M_1 + M_2 + \ldots + M_n ) &lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt; X_0 \cdot ( M_1 + M_2 + \ldots + M_n ) =  X_1 \cdot M_1 + X_2 \cdot M_2 + \ldots + X_n \cdot M_n &lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt; X_0 = \frac{ X_1 \cdot M_1 + X_2 \cdot M_2 + \ldots + X_n \cdot M_n }{ M_1 + M_2 + \ldots + M_n }&lt;/math&gt;

In our example, the values of mu correspond to the masses, and the values of X to location of the masses  
(mu, however, only 'corresponds to the masses' if the initial 'mass' of the output functions are all the same/equivalent. If they are not the same, i.e. some are narrow triangles, while others maybe wide trapizoids or shouldered triangles, then the mass or area of the output function must be known or calculated. It is this mass that is then scaled by mu and multiplied by its location X_i).

This system can be implemented on a standard microprocessor, but dedicated fuzzy chips are now available. For example, Adaptive Logic INC of San Jose, California, sells a "fuzzy chip", the AL220, that can accept four analog inputs and generate four analog outputs. A block diagram of the chip is shown below:

== Antilock brakes ==
As a first example, consider an [[anti-lock braking system]], directed by a microcontroller chip. The microcontroller has to make decisions based on brake [[temperature]], [[speed]], and other variables in the system.

The variable "temperature" in this system can be subdivided into a range of "states": "cold", "cool", "moderate", "warm", "hot", "very hot". The transition from one state to the next is hard to define.

An arbitrary static threshold might be set to divide "warm" from "hot". For example, at exactly 90 degrees, warm ends and hot begins. But this would result in a discontinuous change when the input value passed over that threshold. The transition wouldn't be smooth, as would be required in braking situations.

The way around this is to make the states ''fuzzy''. That is, allow them to change gradually from one state to the next. In order to do this there must be a dynamic relationship established between different factors.

We start by defining the input temperature states using "membership functions":

[[File:Fuzzy control - definition of input temperature states using membership functions.png]]

With this scheme, the input variable's state no longer jumps abruptly from one state to the next. Instead, as the temperature changes, it loses value in one membership function while gaining value in the next. In other words, its ranking in the category of cold decreases as it becomes more highly ranked in the warmer category.

At any sampled timeframe, the "truth value" of the brake temperature will almost always be in some degree part of two membership functions: i.e.: '0.6 nominal and 0.4 warm', or '0.7 nominal and 0.3 cool', and so on.

The above example demonstrates a simple application, using the [[abstraction]] of values from multiple values. This only represents one kind of data, however, in this case, temperature.

Adding additional sophistication to this braking system, could be done by additional factors such as [[Traction (engineering)|traction]], speed, [[inertia]], set up in dynamic functions, according to the designed fuzzy system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vichuzhanin|first=Vladimir|title=Realization of a fuzzy controller with fuzzy dynamic correction|journal=Central European Journal of Engineering|date=12 April 2012|volume=2|issue=3|pages=392–398|doi=10.2478/s13531-012-0003-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical interpretation of fuzzy control==
In spite of the appearance there are several difficulties to give a rigorous logical interpretation of the ''IF-THEN'' rules. As an example, interpret a rule as  ''IF (temperature is "cold") THEN (heater is "high")'' by the first order formula ''Cold(x)→High(y)'' and assume that r is an input such that ''Cold(r)'' is false. Then the formula ''Cold(r)→High(t)'' is true for any ''t'' and therefore any ''t'' gives a correct control given ''r''. A rigorous logical justification of fuzzy control is given in Hájek's book (see Chapter 7) where fuzzy control is represented as a theory of Hájek's basic logic.&lt;ref name = "Hájek" /&gt; Also in Gerla 2005 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerla|first1=Giangiacomo|title=Fuzzy logic programming and fuzzy control|journal=Studia Logica|date=2005|volume=79|issue=2|pages=231–254|doi=10.1007/s11225-005-2977-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; another logical approach to fuzzy control is proposed based on fuzzy logic programming.Indeed, denote by ''f'' the fuzzy function arising of an IF-THEN systems of rules. Then we can translate this system into a fuzzy program P containing a series of rules whose head is "Good(x,y)". The interpretation of this predicate in the least fuzzy [[Herbrand model]] of P coincides with f. This gives further useful tools to fuzzy control.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">{{short description|portrait by Japanese artist Hokusai}}{{italic title}}

The '''''Great Daruma''''' was a monumental portrait created by Japanese artist [[Hokusai]] on 5 October 1817. Also known as the '''''Great Bodhidarma''''', the work is a depiction of [[Bodhidharma]], known in Japan as [[Bodhidharma|Daruma]], a revered [[Buddhist monk]] of the 5th or 6th century. The original artwork was destroyed in May 1945.

== Background ==
The ''Great Daruma'' was not Hokusai's first monumental portrait. In 1804, during a festival at the [[Gokoku-ji]] temple in Edo (modern [[Tokyo]]), he created a portrait of Daruma said to be {{convert|600|ft}} long, using a broom and buckets full of ink.

== Conception ==
[[File:Hokusai Daruma 1817.png|thumb|Contemporary print of [[Hokusai]] painting the ''Great Daruma'' in 1817]]
Hokusai made the ''Great Daruma'' in a courtyard beside the [[Hongan-ji Nagoya Betsuin]] Buddhist temple in [[Nagoya]], Japan. The portrait depicted the head of the monk and his upper body swathed in flowing robes. It was drawn on a large expanse of paper, measuring {{convert|59|x|35|ft|m}}, equivalent to approximately 120 standard [[tatami]] mats of {{convert|70|x|35|in|cm}} each. The eyes were {{convert|70|in|cm}} wide, the nose {{convert|105|in|cm}} long, and the mouth {{convert|82|in|cm}} across. 

The event was advertised in advance to draw a large crowd. Hokusai worked for hours adding bold lines of ink until the image was finally revealed when the paper was hoisted into the air using a large wooden beam attached to one end, like a gigantic [[hanging scroll]], or the huge [[thongdrel]] [[thanka]]s of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] (usually in silk appliqué).

== Reception ==
As a result of this dramatic feat, Hokusai became known in Nagoya as "Daruma-sen", the Daruma master. The triumph brought greater attention to Hokusai, enabling him to sell more prints to the public, including prints of the ''Great Daruma''. He published a new volume of his [[Manga]] sketches in 1817.

== Destruction ==
The original artwork survived in Nagoya until May 1945, when it was destroyed along with the wooden temple building in the [[bombing of Nagoya in World War II]]. Contemporaneous promotional handbills survive, with some held at the [[Nagoya City Museum]].

'''Group sex''' is [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] involving more than two participants.  Group sex can occur between people of all [[sexual orientation]]s and genders.  Group sex also occurs in populations of non-human animals such as [[Bonobo#Sexual social behavior|bonobo]] apes and [[chimpanzee]]s.

Group sex most commonly takes place in a private '''sex party''' or semi-public '''[[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinger gathering]]''', but may also take place at [[massage parlor]]s or [[brothel]]s or, in some jurisdictions, at purpose-built locations such as [[sex club]]s. In places where [[Polyamory|non-monogamous sex]] is [[taboo]] or illegal, group sex may take place in private or clandestine locations including homes, [[hotel]] rooms, or private clubs.

[[Sexual fantasy|Fantasies]] of group sex are extremely common among both men and women, and group sex is a subgenre in [[pornographic film]]s.

==Terms==
[[File:Kama Sutra 50 detail.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Depiction of group sex in the [[Kama Sutra]]]]
[[File:KamaSutra25.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Illustration from the Kama Sutra]]
In principle, any sexual behavior performed by more than two people can be referred to as group sex, but various terms are used to describe particular acts or combinations of people.  Many swingers argue that non-swingers have conflated the terms because of lack of understanding and that there are distinct differences among the terms with specific meanings as to number, intent, sexual orientation, and familiarity of the persons involved.
;'''[[Circle jerk (sexual practice)|Circle jerk]]''': Group [[masturbation]] among men, usually sitting in somewhat of a circle formation.
;'''[[Daisy chain (sex)|Daisy chain]]''': Group of participants perform [[cunnilingus]] or [[fellatio]] on each other in a circular formation, permitting each participant to both give and receive oral sex simultaneously.
;'''[[Gang bang]]''': A number of people performing sex acts on one person, either in turn or at the same time.
;'''[[Threesome]]''' or '''three-way''': Three people all having sexual relations, not necessarily simultaneously. Not to be confused with [[ménage à trois]] (literally, "household of three").
;[[Foursome (group sex)|Foursome]] or '''four-way''': Sex between four people. Not to be confused with [[ménage à quatre]] (literally, "household of four").
;'''[[Double Penetration|Double penetration]]''': When a person is entered or penetrated in the vagina and/or anus by two people at the same time. This usually is when one enters the anus while another enters the vagina, although it does also refer to two simultaneous penetrations in the same orifice.
;'''Spintrian''': Term used by [[Suetonius]] to describe sexual group practices indulged in by the emperor [[Tiberius]] on [[Capri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Manual of classical erotology ([[De figuris Veneris]]) | first=Friedrich Karl | last=Forberg | authorlink=Friedrich Karl Forberg | publisher=Medical Press of New York | year=1963 | page=233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;'''Monogamous Group Sex''' or '''Same Room Sex''' (a.k.a. Soft Swapping): Couples engaging in sexual activity in the same room but in separate pairs, without any [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swapping of partners]] or other major sexual activity between couples.

==Prevalence==
Fantasies of group sex are extremely common among both men and women. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Many forms of sexual behavior were reported by Kinsey's subjects, but the official Kinsey Reports web site does not mention threesomes or group sex in the summary of Kinsey's findings.

[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (25).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Illustration of an orgy by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]]]]
A sex party is a gathering at which [[human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] takes place. Sex parties may be organized to enable people to engage in [[casual sexual activity]] or for [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinging couples]] or people interested in group sex to meet, but any gathering where sexual activity is anticipated can be called a sex party.

Sex parties, under various names, have been a common focus of [[moral panic]]s fed by media reports claiming that such parties are prevalent, or growing in prevalence, especially among teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/independent-woman/love-sex/is-your-teen-sending-you-secret-sex-sgnals-2235874.html|title=Is your teen sending secret sex signals?|last=Daly|first=Susan|date=Jun 26, 2010|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are number of types of sex parties:

===Swinger party/gathering===
A [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinger]] party or partner-swapping party is a gathering at which individuals or couples in a [[committed relationship]] can engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] with others as a [[recreational sex|recreational]] or social activity.&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers"&gt;{{cite journal

 |volume=3
 |accessdate=2010-01-24
 |url=http://www.ejhs.org/volume3/swing/body.htm}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Swinging takes place in various contexts, ranging from a spontaneous sexual activity at an informal social gathering of friends to a regular social gathering in a [[sex club]] (or swinger club) or residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swingingheaven.co.uk/advice/swingers-clubs.html|title=Advice on Swingers' Clubs|publisher=Swinging Heaven|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swinger parties may involve various group sex activities.  Partners can engage in [[sexual intercourse|penetrative sex]], known as "full swap", or choose to "soft swap" in which they engage only in [[non-penetrative sex]]. New swinging couples often choose a soft swap before they are comfortable with a full swap, although many couples stay soft swap for personal reasons.&lt;ref name="What Is a Swinger?"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://swingersocial.com/swinger-blog/?page_id=13 | title=What is a Swinger? | publisher=The Swinger Blog | date=Sep 2011 | accessdate=April 15, 2012 | author=Wojick, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Soft swinging" is when a couple engages in sexual activities with only each other while other couples perform sex acts in the immediate vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swingersocial.com/lifestyle-sex-defintions/s|title=SWINGERS DEFINITIONS - Swinger words that begin with a S|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically this is a form of exhibitionism rather than "group sex" per se.

===Rainbow party===
A [[rainbow party (sexuality)|rainbow party]] is a baseless [[urban legend]] spread from the early 2000s. At these events, allegedly increasingly popular among adolescents, females wearing various shades of lipstick take turns [[Fellatio|fellating]] males in sequence, leaving multiple colours on their penises,&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;Lewin, Tamar (June 30, 2005). [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/30/fashion/thursdaystyles/30rainbow.html?ex=1157774400&amp;en=ac7b855f4b419e84&amp;ei=5070 "Are These Parties for Real?"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved August 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ignoring the fact that in such a situation the colors would blend.

Rainbow parties were covered on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in 2003, and became the subject of a juvenile novel called ''Rainbow Party''.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; On May 27, 2010, the television program ''[[The Doctors (2008 TV series)|The Doctors]]'' discussed the topic with dozens of teens, parents, and professionals. However, sex researchers and adolescent health care professionals have found no evidence for the existence of rainbow parties, and as such attribute the spread of the stories to a [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

===Orgy===
[[File:Fourgy-Inked-Colour.png|thumb|2 bisexual men and 2 bisexual women ringed in a circlular foursome [[sex position]] performing 4 combinations of oral sex: M-F, F-F, F-M, M-M.]]
An [[orgy]] is a gathering where guests freely engage in open and unrestrained sexual activity or group sex; and a [[bunga bunga]] orgy is an orgy in which participants have [[Aquaphilia (fetish)|sex underwater]], such as in a [[swimming pool]] or a [[hot tub]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-07/silvio-berlusconis-bunga-bunga-parties/ [[Silvio Berlusconi|Berlusconi]]’s "Bunga Bunga Orgies"—Daily Beast 7 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual positions and combinations possible only in group sex==
{{main article|List of sex positions#Group sex|l1=List of sex positions for group sex}}

==Initialism codes==
[[Image:PeterFendi Erotic Scene.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Fendi]] portrayed group sex in [[lithography]], c. 1834]]
A system of [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]]s has evolved to describe the variety of group sex arrangements. These codes can appear in [[erotic literature]] and film descriptions, member profiles in online communities, and personal ads. These codes consist of arrangements of the letters ''M'' (for ''male'') and ''F'' (for ''female''). Adjacent letters are sometimes used to signify sexual contact between the participants represented by those letters, though this does not necessarily mean there is no contact between the other participants. For example, ''MMF'' would signify a [[ménage à trois]] of two men and one woman in which the center male has sexual contact with the other male and the female, and in which it is not specified whether there is contact between the female and the other male. ''MFMF'' (situation pictured in photo to right), on the other hand, implies no same-sex contact.

Variations on this system exist that use case to convey more information. Within the [[BDSM]] and [[Domination &amp; submission (BDSM)|D/s]] subcultures, upper and lower case letters can signify [[dominant (BDSM)|dominant]] (or [[top (BDSM)|top]]) and [[submissive (BDSM)|submissive]] (or [[bottom (BDSM)|bottom]]), respectively.

==Daisy chain==
A daisy chain refers to sexual relations among three or more people, with each person both performing and receiving [[oral sex]] simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peevish.co.uk/slang/d.htm|title=A dictionary of slang - "D" - Slang and colloquialisms of the UK.|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources consider only groups of five or more people to be a daisy chain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theswinginglife.com/vocabulary.htm |title=theswinginglife.com |publisher= |accessdate=16 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204165221/http://www.theswinginglife.com/vocabulary.htm |archivedate=4 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and some define the term to require all participants be female.

Self-evidently, for a closed daisy chain to be entirely [[heterosexual]] there must be an equal number of males and females, making the number of participants even. An odd number of participants would result in two people having to connect "both ways" to complete the chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4493353.stm | title=Are teen sex antics tall tales?| author= | date=28 April 2005 | publisher=''[[BBC News]]'' | accessdate=2006-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1588791,00.html | title=Teenage ‘daisy chain’ sex alert| author=Nigel Hawkes and Sam Lister | date=28 April 2005 | publisher=''[[The Times]]'' | accessdate=2006-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in an “erotic foursome or ''partie-carrée''”,  “two couples ... form a chain or Maltese cross carefully alternating man and woman”.&lt;ref&gt;Legman 1969, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

"The matter of ... erotic or spintrian chains ("daisy-chains")",&lt;ref&gt;Legman 1969, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; i.e,  "of "spintries" or erotic human chains, ... has been taken to ... permutational development in the appendix of postures to the well-known ''Manual of Classical Erotology'' (1824) of the Fichtean philosopher, [[Friedrich Karl Forberg]], and in a Swedish work, ''Ju fler vi är tillsammans'' (“The More the Merrier”), by a schoolteacher, Ragnar Aaslund, published in 1966 and intended frankly as a manual of group-sex."&lt;ref&gt;Legman 1969, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bukkake==
{{main article|Bukkake}}
[[Bukkake]] is a group sex practice where multiple men [[ejaculation|ejaculate]] onto the face or body of a female or male subject. At the end of the process, the subject may drink the [[semen]], called [[gokkun]]. Its first filming is credited to adult filmmaker [[Kazuhiko Matsumoto]] in 1998. Bukkake originally became a [[pornography]] trend because of the mandatory porn [[pixelization|mosaic]] in Japan. Since the directors could not show penetration they had to figure out new, visually appealing ways to approach sex acts that would satisfy the audience without violating Japanese law.

==Health==
As with all sexual activity, the relative risks of group sex depend on the specific activities engaged in, although having a large number of sexual partners increases one's risk of exposure to [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs).

From the mid-1980s there was lobbying against gay bathhouses blaming them for the spread of STIs, in particular [[HIV]], and this forced their closure in some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Proponents point out that venues where group sex takes place often provide [[condom]]s, [[dental dam]]s, [[latex glove]]s, [[sex lubricant|lubricants]] and other items for safer sex. Bathhouses in particular are a major source of safer sex information—they provide pamphlets and post safer sex posters prominently (often on the walls of each room as well as in the common areas), provide free condoms and lubricants, and often require patrons to affirm that they will only have safer sex on the premises.&lt;ref name="Alex%252520Westerfelt%252520"&gt;{{cite web|last=Westerfelt |first=Alex |title=Bathhouse Norms: What goes on in the Bathhouse? |publisher=Healthy Living |date=August 2005 |url=http://www.4healthyliving.org/05aug.htm |accessdate=10 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220130453/http://www.4healthyliving.org/05aug.htm |archivedate=February 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharon%252520Bernstein"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Sharon|title=Rising Rate of HIV Infection Renews Bathhouse Debate|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|date=March 23, 2004|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/23/local/me-bathhouse23 |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS to hold STI testing in gay sauna|date=October 15, 2007|newspaper=Pink News|accessdate=21 October 2009|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-5752.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=QX758&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[QX (British magazine)|QX Magazine]] London|date=September 17, 2009|publisher=QX|accessdate=25 October 2009|issue=758|page=44|url=http://viewer.zmags.com/showmag.php?mid=rqqwpg#/page44|title=QX journal article|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Corporate involvement==
A 1996 [[sexual harassment]] case filed against [[Mitsubishi Motors North America|Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America]] by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) highlighted corporate involvement by Mitsubishi in sex parties arranged by managers and other employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contilaw.com/pleadings/EEOCvMitsubishsi.htm "Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v.

Conti, LLC, Filing 96-1192, September 15, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
Sensational media reports about the prevalence of sex parties, especially among young people, appear with some regularity. In the early 1950s, for example, it was alleged that teenage girls, mainly throughout the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] [[United States]] were forming "non-virgin clubs", in which they organized and held [[orgy|sex orgies]] with reports of couples being paired off by drawing numbers from a hat. These claims were investigated and debunked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qy0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CPEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6771,6733980&amp;dq=non+virgin+clubs&amp;hl=en|title='Non-Virgin Club'  New Aspect of Teen-age Sex Misbehavior |last=Morin |first=Relmin |date=August 26, 1951 |work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]] |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cahn, Susan (2007).

Several stories of this type arose in the US in 2003. In New York, rumors began that teens had been taking days off from school to attend "hooky parties" while their parents were at work. One school even suspended a group of girls for allegedly skipping school to attend such a party. They were refused the right to return to school until each had submitted to a medical examination for sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy and school officials were allowed to examine the results. The [[American Civil Liberties Union|New York Civil Liberties Union]] filed a federal lawsuit against the school&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/studentsrights/gen/12776prs20030708.html "NYCLU Sues New York School Officials for Forcing Teen-Age Girls to Undergo Intrusive Medical Exams"] (July 8, 2003). aclu.org. Retrieved February 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of the girls and won a settlement which included monetary damages and a change in the school district's policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyclu.org/case/doe-and-roe-v-reid nyclu.org/case/doe-and-roe-v-reid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707061617/http://www.nyclu.org/case/doe-and-roe-v-reid |date=2010-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar stories concerning teenagers using [[gel bracelet]]s as coupons or signals for sex also arose at the time, with a similar lack of corroborating evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara (2003).

'''Hercules X-1''' (Her X-1), also known as 4U1656+35, is a moderately strong [[X-ray binary]] source first studied by the [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] [[satellite]].
It is composed of a [[neutron star]] accreting [[matter]] from a normal [[star]] (HZ Her) probably due to [[Roche lobe]] overflow.

==Intermediate-mass X-ray binary (IMXB)==

Her X-1 is the prototype for the massive X-ray binaries although it falls on the borderline, {{Solar mass|~2|link=y}}, between high- and low-mass X-ray binaries.&lt;ref name=Priedhorsky/&gt;

An [[X-ray binary#Intermediate-mass X-ray binary|intermediate-mass X-ray binary]] (IMXB) is a [[binary star]] system where one of the components is a neutron star or a [[black hole]]. The other component is an intermediate mass star.&lt;ref name=Podsiadlowski&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Podsiadlowski P, Rappaport S, Pfahl E |title=Evolutionary Binary Sequences for Low- and Intermediate-Mass X-ray Binaries |date=2001 |doi=10.1086/324686 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=565 |issue=2 |pages=1107 |arxiv=astro-ph/0107261 |bibcode=2002ApJ...565.1107P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intensity==
[[Image:Herx1 lc.gif|500px|thumb|right|This light curve of Her X-1 shows long term and medium term variability. Each pair of vertical lines delineate the eclipse of the compact object behind its companion star. In this case, the companion is a 2 Solar-mass star with a radius of nearly 4 times that of the [[Sun]]. This eclipse shows the 1.7-day orbital period of the system.]]
The source exhibits complex time variability, pulsing with a [[Orbital period|period]] of 1.24 s due to the rotation of the neutron star, eclipsing every 1.70 days with the period of the binary orbit, and also varying with a 35-day period believed associated with the precession of the [[accretion disk]]. From observations, a twisted accretion disk, in [[retrograde motion|retrograde]] [[precession]], modulates the X-rays illuminating HZ Her and Earth.&lt;ref name=Priedhorsky&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Priedhorsky WC, Holt SS |title=Long-term cycles in cosmic X-ray sources |journal=Space Sci.

[[Image:Herx1 spin.gif|400px|thumb|right|Uhuru observations revealed the presence of X-ray pulsations in Her X-1 (1.2 s) and confirmed that it contains a rapidly rotating neutron star. Figure adapted from figures by E. Schreier, STScI, taken from Figure 7-2a in Charles and Seward.]]
The 1.24 second pulsar period associated with Her X-1 is immediately evident from the data. The sharp cut-off at ~24 [[keV]] in the flat spectrum observed for Her X-1 in this exposure provided the first reported evidence for [[radiative transfer]] effects to be associated with a highly magnetized [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] near the surface of a neutron star.
[[Image:Rocket graph.gif|300px|thumb|right|The figure shows 15-second samples of the raw counts (per 20.48 ms) observed in a 1973 sounding-rocket-borne exposure to three of the X-ray brightest binary sources in the Milky Way galaxy: Her X-1 (1.7 days), Cyg X-3 (0.2 day), and Cyg X-1 (5.6 days).]]

==Discovery of Her X-1==

No radio eclipses were detected that corresponded. At that time Doxsey&lt;ref name=Doxsey/&gt; specified that (1) repeated radio searches, especially during the high X-ray luminosity state of Her X-1, should be made and (2) there was a clear need for a better position determination for Her X-1.

In 1973, Bahcall and Bahcall determined that HZ Herculis had a light curve that matched Hercules X-1's, fixing Hercules X-1's position.

It superseded the IAU's previous recommendations of 1964 (see [[IAU (1964) System of Astronomical Constants]]), became in effect in the [[Astronomical Almanac]] from 1984 onward, and remained in use until the introduction of the [[IAU (2009) System of Astronomical Constants]].

== Units ==
The IAU(1976) system is based on the [[astronomical system of units]]:
* The astronomical unit of ''time'' is the day ('''D''') of 86,400 [[SI]] [[second]]s, which is close to the mean [[solar day]] of civil clock time.
* The astronomical unit of ''mass'' is the mass of the Sun ('''S''').
* The astronomical unit of ''length'' is known as '''the''' [[astronomical unit]] ('''A''' or '''au'''), which in the IAU(1976) system is defined as the length for which the [[gravitational constant]], more specifically the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] '''k''' expressed in the astronomical units (''i.e.'' k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has units A&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;), takes the value of {{nowrap|0.017 202 098 95}} .  This astronomical unit is approximately the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun.  The value of '''k''' is the [[angular velocity]] in radians per day ('''i.e.''' the daily [[mean motion]]) of an infinitesimally small mass that moves around the Sun in a circular orbit at a distance of 1 AU.

There are several reasons for the recent popularity of industrial AI: More affordable sensors and the automated process of data acquisition; More powerful computation capability of computers to perform more complex tasks at a faster speed with lower cost; Faster connectivity infrastructure and more accessible cloud services for data management and computing power outsourcing.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schatsky|first1=David|last2=Muraskin|first2=Craig|last3=Gurumurthy|first3=Ragu|title=Cognitive technologies: The real opportunities for business|url=http://www2.deloitte.com/tr/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/cognitive-technologies.html|publisher=Deloitte Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the technology alone never creates any business value if the problems in industry are not well studied. The major categories where industrial AI may contribute to are product and service innovation, process improvement, and insight discovery.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Categories ==

=== Product applications for user value creation ===

Industrial AI can be embedded to existing products or services to make them more effective, reliable, safer, and last longer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; One example is the automobile industry uses vision recognition to avoid accidents, stay in lane, and use speech recognition to facilitate safer driving. In manufacturing, one example is the prediction of blade life for self-aware [[Bandsaw|band saw]] machines, so that users will be able to rely on evidence of degradation rather than experience, which is safer, will extend blade life, and build up blade usage profile to help blade selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=【世界翻轉中】不怕機器翻臉　感應器讀懂它的心！ - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFlmZgbbWBA|website=Youtube|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Shanhu|last2=Begheri|first2=Behrad|last3=Kao|first3=Hung-An|last4=Lee|first4=Jay|date=2015|title=A Unified Framework and Platform for Designing of Cloud-Based Machine Health Monitoring and Manufacturing Systems|url=https://manufacturingscience.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleID=2397338|journal=Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering|volume=137|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.1115/1.4030669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial AI can create new products and novel business models.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Predix (software)|Predix]] by [[General Electric]] is a [[Cloud Foundry]] that serves as an industrial operating system for narrow AI application development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; InsightCM™&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NI InsightCMTM Enterprise for Condition Monitoring - National Instruments|url=http://www.ni.com/insightcm/|website=National Instruments|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[National Instruments]] and Watchdog Agent® Toolbox&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watchdog AgentTM Prognostics Toolkit for LabVIEW - IMS Center|url=http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/210191|website=National Instruments|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[LabVIEW]] platform also provide software analytical capabilities. The aforementioned band saw machine manufacturer also announced their service center system to help users improve equipment reliability and sawing efficiency as a novel business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Service Center Equipment Brands|url=http://www.metalcenternews.com/Portals/51/PDF_Files/1505_Top5_ServiceCenters.pdf|website=Metal Center News|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process applications for productivity improvement ===
Automation is one of the major aspects in process applications of industrial AI.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; With the help of AI, the scope and pace of automation have been fundamentally changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Chui|first2=Michael|last3=Miremadi|first3=Mehdi|last4=Bughin|first4=Jacques|last5=George|first5=Katy|last6=Willmott|first6=Paul|last7=Dewhurst|first7=Martin|date=2017|title=A Future that Works: Automation, Employment, and Productivity|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Global%20Themes/Digital%20Disruption/Harnessing%20automation%20for%20a%20future%20that%20works/MGI-A-future-that-works-Executive-summary.ashx|journal=|volume=|pages=|last1=Manyika|first1=James|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI technologies boost the performance and expand the capability of conventional AI applications. An example is the [[collaborative robots]]. Collaborative robotic arms are able to learn the motion and path demonstrated by human operators and perform the same task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Does Collaborative Robot Mean ?|url=http://blog.robotiq.com/what-does-collaborative-robot-mean|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI also automates the process that used to require human participation. An example is the Hong Kong subway, where an AI program decides the distribution and job scheduling of engineers with more efficiency and reliability than human counterparts do.

Another aspect of process applications is the modeling large-scale systems.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Cyber manufacturing|Cybermanufacturing]] systems are defined as a manufacturing service system that is networked and resilient to faults by evidence-based modeling and data-driven [[deep learning]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such a system deals with large and usually geographically distributed assets, which is hard to be modeled via conventional individual-asset physics-based model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jin|first1=Chao|last2=Djurdjanovic|first2=Dragan|last3=Ardakani Davari|first3=Hossein|last4=Wang|first4=Keren|last5=Buzza|first5=Mathew|last6=Begheri|first6=Behrad|last7=Brown|first7=Ptrick|last8=Lee|first8=Jay|title=A comprehensive framework of factory-to-factory dynamic fleet-level prognostics and operation management for geographically distributed assets|journal=2015 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)|date=2015|pages=225–230|doi=10.1109/CoASE.2015.7294066}}&lt;/ref&gt; With machine learning and optimization algorithms, a bottom-up framework considering machine health can leverage large samples of assets and automate the operation management, spare part inventory planning, and maintenance scheduling process.

=== Insight applications for knowledge discovery ===
Industrial AI can also be used for [[knowledge discovery]] by identifying insights in engineering systems.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In aviation and aeronautics, AI has been playing a vital role in many critical areas, one of which is safety assurance and root cause. NASA is trying to proactively manage risks to aircraft safety by analyzing flight numeric data and text reports in parallel to not only detect anomalies but also relate it to the causal factors. This mined insight of why certain faults happen in the past will shed light on predictions of similar incidents in the future and prevent problems before they occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laskowski|first1=Nicole|title=NASA uses text analytics to bolster aviation safety|url=http://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/feature/NASA-uses-text-analytics-to-bolster-aviation-safety|website=TechTarget Network|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Predictive and preventive maintenance]] through data-driven [[machine learning]] is also critical in cost reduction for industrial applications. [[Prognostics]] and health management ([[Prognostics and health management|PHM]]) programs capture the opportunities at the shop floor by modeling equipment health degradation. The obtained information can be used for efficiency improvement and quality improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|last2=Lapira|first2=Edzel|title=Prognostics and health management tools for semiconductor manufacturing predictability|journal=Nanochip|date=2011|pages=11–15|url=http://imscenter.net/IMS_news/AGS_Nanochip.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Please see [[intelligent maintenance system]] for more reference.

== Challenges ==
The challenges of industrial AI to unlock the value lies in the transformation of raw data to intelligent predictions for rapid decision-making. In general, there are four major challenges in realizing industrial AI.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Data ===
Engineering systems now generate a lot of data and modern industry is indeed a [[big data]] environment. However, industrial data usually is structured, but may be low-quality. The “3B” issues of [[industrial big data]] is:&lt;ref name="Industrial Big Data"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|title=Industrial Big Data|date=2015|publisher=Mechanical Industry Press|location=China|isbn=978-7-111-50624-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bad
The quality of the data may be poor, and unlike other consumer-faced applications, data from industrial systems usually have clear physical meanings, which makes it harder to compensate the quality with volume.
* Broken
Data collected for training machine learning models usually is lacking a comprehensive set of working conditions and health states/fault modes, which may cause false positives and false negatives in online implementation of AI systems.
* Background
Industrial data patterns can be highly transient and interpreting them requires domain expertise, which can hardly be harnessed by merely mining numeric data.

=== Speed ===
Production process happens fast and the equipment and work piece can be expensive, the AI applications need to be applied in real-time to be able to detect anomalies immediately to avoid waste and other consequences. Cloud-based solutions can be powerful and fast, but they still would not fit certain computation efficiency requirements. Edge computing may be a better choice in such scenario.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== High fidelity requirement ===
Unlike consumer-faced AI recommendations systems which have a high tolerance for false positives and negatives, even a very low rate of false positives or negatives rate may cost the total credibility of AI systems. Industrial AI applications are usually dealing with critical issues related to safety, reliability, and operations. Any failure in predictions could incur a negative economic and/or safety impact on the users and discourage them to rely on AI systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Interpretability ===
Besides prediction accuracy and performance fidelity, the industrial AI systems must also go beyond prediction results and give root cause analysis for anomalies. This requires that during development, data scientists need to work with domain experts and include domain know-how into the modeling process, and have the model adaptively learn and accumulate such insights as knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Institut für Meereskunde''' (IfM, Institute of Marine Sciences) in Kiel, Germany, existed from April 1, 1937 to January 1, 2004. It was an essential element of the long history of marine sciences in Kiel. This history started with the work of [[:de:Samuel Reyher|Samuel Reyher]] published in 1697 and is today continued within the [[GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel]].&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Th17" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="HW15e" /&gt;

==Early history==

Early work in physical/chemical oceanography started with Samuel Reyher, professor at the ''Christian Albrecht [University of Kiel]'' (CAU), when he published his investigation on salinity in the ice-covered Kiel Fjord in 1697.&lt;ref group="p" name="Rey97e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Kor94e" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mat10"&gt;Wolfgang Matthäus: “Germany and the investigation of the Baltic Sea hydrography during the 19th and early 20th century. In: “Meereswissenschaftliche Berichte”, Warnemünde 2010, 83, S. 1 - 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Other professors of Kiel University followed with work on marine topics. [[:de:Johann Nikolaus Tetens|Johann Nikolaus Tetens]] (1736-1807) studied tides of the North Sea,&lt;ref group="p" name="KortPaffen79e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="PaffenKort84e" /&gt; [[:de:Christoph Heinrich Pfaff|Christoph Heinrich Pfaff]] (1773-1852) studied hydrographic and chemical conditions in the western Baltic Sea,&lt;ref group="Einzel" name="Pfaff" /&gt; and [[:de:Gustav Adolf Michaelis|Gustav Adolf Michaelis]] (1798-1848) discussed optical effects in the sea.&lt;ref name="Micha"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=BFcHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=gustav+adolf+michaelis+kiel+meer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iZXhwtJRfH&amp;sig=Z0SiNCZnOQ0wpXGihBSt1Suj3a4&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj19oHBopLbAhVMJlAKHRoiByAQ6AEIZjAM#v=onepage&amp;q=gustav%20adolf%20michaelis%20kiel%20meer&amp;f=false |title=Ueber das Leuchten der Ostsee nach eigenen Beobachtungen |accessdate=May 21, 2018 | language=German | trans-title=On the shining of the Baltic Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic marine research, however, began only later during the 19th century with biological studies, most notably by the zoologist [[:de:Karl August Möbius|Karl August Möbius]] (1825-1908), the physiologist [[Victor Hensen]] (1835-1924), the marine production biologist [[Karl Brandt]] (1854-1931), and the zoologist [[:de:Wilhelm Friedrich Georg Behn|Wilhelm Friedrich Georg Behn]] (1808-1878) who participated in the first of the Danish [[Galathea expeditions]] (1845-1847). The [[:de:Plankton-Expedition|Plankton-Expedition]] in the Atlantic Ocean on the ’’National’’ in 1889 was the beginning of deep-sea expeditions carried out by Kiel scientists.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt;

Systematic physical and chemical marine studies also started during the second half of the 19th century. Two people need to be acknowledged in particular. The merchant and industrialist [[:de:Heinrich Adolph Meyer|Heinrich Adolph Meyer]] (1822-1889) from Hamburg managed to  convene a group united by marine research interests. The physicist [[Gustav Karsten]] (1820-1900) from Kiel belonged to this group. A long-term cooperation developed among these two people. Beginning in 1859, Meyer carried out first hydrographic observations in Kiel Fjord and started systematic measurements for the investigation of seasonal changes in the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref group="p" name="Mat10" /&gt; Meyer received his honorary doctor from Kiel University in 1866.

A major step was the establishment of the “Prussian Commission for the Scientific Investigation of German Seas in Kiel“ (also called the ''Kiel Commission''; in German: ''Preußische Kommission zur wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung der deutschen Meere in Kiel''). Meyer was a founding member and held the first chair until 1880, with Karsten being his successor until 1896. Möbius and Hensen were also members of the commission. The main objective was the improvement of fisheries. But it became evident soon that this goal could not be reached without an improved knowledge of the hydrography and the development of new approaches and methods. Subsequently the Kiel Commission played an important role in the development of marine sciences in Gemany.&lt;ref group="Einzel" name="KoCu1902" /&gt; A "Laboratory for international marine science" (in German: "Laboratorium für die internationale Meeresforschung") was established by the Commission in 1902. Furthermore, the geographer [[Otto Krümmel]] became professor at Kiel University in 1883,&lt;ref group="p" name="Ko05e"/&gt; strengthening hydrographic work. He wrote the first textbook (2 volumes) on oceanography in German language.&lt;ref group="p" name="Kr07e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Kr11e" /&gt; The Institute of Zoology and [[Zoological Museum of Kiel University]] became the center of marine biological research, led by [[:de:Adolf Remane|Adolf Remane]] (1898-1976) from 1924 to 1934. In addition, Kiel was the home of outstanding scientists and engineers in marine acoustics as part of industry and navy, in particular [[Alexander Behm]] (1880-1952), Hugo Lichte (1891-1963)&lt;ref group="Einzel" name="Lichte1919" /&gt; and [[:de:Karl Heinrich Hecht|Karl Heinrich Hecht]] (1880-1961).

==Institut für Meereskunde==

The University of Kiel decided to concentrate marine sciences within an institution of the university, and the ''Institut für Meereskunde'' (IfM) was founded in 1937.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ge00e" /&gt; Activities of the former laboratories of the Kiel Commission were included in the new institution. The institute had three departments: Biology, Hydrography and Chemistry, and Geology. In addition to disciplinary work, interdisciplinary approaches took root. Studies in the Baltic Sea were supposed to be in the focus, but not exclusively. A building in Kitzeberg on the eastern shore of Kiel Fjord was provided. Remane was director of the IfM from 1937 to 1944. The marine chemist [[:de:Hermann Wattenberg|Hermann Wattenberg]] (1901-1944) became his successor on May 1, 1944. He perished shortly after the appointment on July 24, 1944, together with eight other members of the institute, when bombs destroyed the institute’s building during World War II.

After the end of the war in 1945, work at the IfM already started again in 1946.&lt;ref name="KoCu1946"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanrep.geomar.de/22468/1/1946-1972.pdf |title=Meeresforschung in Kiel 1946-1972|accessdate=May 21, 2018 |language=German | trans-title=Marine research in Kiel 1946-1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Georg Wüst]] (1890-1977) became Professor of Oceanography and Meteorology at the CAU and Director of the IfM. He had been a scientific leader at the former Institute and Museum of Marine Sciences at Berlin University (in German: “Institut und [[:de:Museum für Meereskunde (Berlin)|Museum für Meereskunde (Berlin)]]“ &lt;ref group="p" name="Kor87e" /&gt; and had mostly performed research on the circulation of water masses in the global ocean and in particular in the deep Atlantic. In Kiel he succeeded in retrieving several earlier members of the institute, getting the permission to use an old villa on the western shore of Kiel as an institute’s building, obtaining the research cutter “Südfall“ and restarting educational programs.&lt;ref name="Erdk51"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=25635619 | title=Der Wiederaufbau der deutschen ozeanographischen Forschung nach dem Zusammenbruch im Urteil des Auslandes | language=German | trans-title=The rebuilding of German oceanographic research after the downfall in the judgement of foreign countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Wue56e" /&gt; He began research work in the Baltic Sea with a total staff of 15.

After Wüst’s retirement [[Günter Dietrich]] (1911-1972) became his successor. He had been a student at the University of Berlin and had also studied the circulation of water masses in the Atlantic Ocean with Georg Wüst and [[Albert Defant]] at the former Berlin institute. Wüst’s and Dietrich’s experience in deep ocean studies strengthened the orientation of the IfM work towards the open and deep ocean, in particular in physical and chemical oceanography. The IfM became the leading marine research institution in West Germany during those years,&lt;ref group="p" name="Mc64" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kr87e"&gt;Wolfgang Krauss: ''Günter Dietrichs Kieler Jahre (1959 - 1972).''[“Günter Dietrich’s years in Kiel (1959 - 1972)“] In: '' Christiana Albertina.'' Neumünster 1987, 24 N.F. S. 43-54.&lt;/ref&gt; carrying on the scientific legacy of the former Berlin institute in research&lt;ref group="p" name="Wue56e" /&gt; and education.&lt;ref group="p" name="Mc64" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Di57e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Di75e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Di80" /&gt; Technically, the successor of the earlier Museum of Marine Sciences in Berlin today is the [[German Museum of Technology]] in Berlin.

An important milestone in the IfM’s development was the commission of the new research vessel [[:de:Meteor (Schiff, 1964)|Meteor (Schiff, 1964)]], operated jointly by the German Hydrographic Office (see [[Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany]]) and the German Research Foundation (see [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]. The ship was used by all interested research groups in Germany. The first major expedition 1964/65 to the Red Sea and Indian Ocean was part of the ''International Indian Ocean Expedition''.&lt;ref name="scorIIOE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iioe-2.incois.gov.in/IIOE-2/iioe.jsp |title=About International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE) |accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German contribution was led by [[Günter Dietrich]] and [[:de:Eugen Seibold|Eugen Seibold]], both from Kiel University, and the majority of scientists and technicians were based in Kiel.&lt;ref group="p" name="Di66e" /&gt; This expedition was the restart of deep-sea oceanography in Kiel.

The financial needs of the IfM were increasing with its tasks and number of personnel, having increased to 124 in the year 1968.&lt;ref group="p" name="JBI68e" /&gt; In order to obtain additional funding from the federal and other state governments, the IfM joined the group of “blue list” research institutions (see [[Leibniz Association]] in 1968. New statutes introduced a collegial system, with the acting director being elected for two-year terms by a panel composed of department heads and employee representatives. Although the funding was no longer related to the university budget, strong ties to the CAU prevailed. Professors were selected jointly by the IfM and the CAU.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ad92e" /&gt;

During the following years the IfM became partner in a considerable number of international research programs.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt; A relevant number of IfM scientists worked at foreign research institutions for extended time periods, primarily in the USA. Later a large number of foreign investigators joined the IfM as visiting scientists. The number of employees was increasing steadily.

In the meantime marine geology and geophysics groups had developed parallel to the IfM groups at the CAU. Parts of these activities were combined in the new geoscience institute “Geomar” established in 1987.&lt;ref group="p" name="Th17" /&gt; At the end of 2001 Geomar had 153 members of staff.&lt;ref name="JBG02"&gt;“GEOMAR Jahresbericht/Annual Report 2001.” GEOMAR Forschungszentrum für marine Geowissenschaften der Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel 2001, 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt; The staff of the IfM had increased to 252 by that time.&lt;ref group="p" name="JBI02" /&gt; With the aim of achieving an increasing collaboration of marine disciplines in Kiel, the “IfM” and “Geomar” joined organizationally to form “IFM-GEOMAR” as part of the “Leibniz Association” on January 1, 2004. The new institution had 389 members of staff at its beginning.&lt;ref name="JBG05"&gt;Andreas Villwock (Ed.): “IFM-GEOMAR Report 2002-2004.” Leibniz-Institut für Meereswissenschaften, Kiel 2005, A-2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to fiscal considerations, IFM-GEOMAR was transferred to an institution of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]] on January 1, 2004, thus being primarily funded by the federal government. The name changed to [[GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel]].

The '''International Typographic Style''', also known as the '''Swiss Style''', is a [[graphic design]] style that emerged in Russia, the Netherlands, and Germany in the 1920s and was developed by designers in [[Switzerland]] during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lessons From Swiss Style Graphic Design – Smashing Magazine|url = http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/lessons-from-swiss-style-graphic-design/|website = Smashing Magazine|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Typographic Style has had profound influence on graphic design as a part of the modernist movement, impacting many design-related fields including architecture and art. It emphasizes cleanness, readability, and objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1080070/International-Typographic-Style International Typographic Style]&lt;/ref&gt; Hallmarks of the style are asymmetric layouts, use of a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]], [[sans-serif]] typefaces like [[Akzidenz Grotesk]], and [[flush left]], ragged right text. The style is also associated with a preference for photography in place of illustrations or drawings. Many of the early International Typographic Style works featured [[typography]] as a primary design element in addition to its use in text, and it is for this that the style is named.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Arts &amp; Entertainment: graphic design, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1032864/graphic-design THE INTERNATIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC STYLE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalposter.com/about-poster-art/international-typographic.aspx International Poster Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; The influences of this graphic movement can still be seen in design strategy and theory to this day.

==History==
The style emerged from a desire to represent information objectively, free from the influence of associated meaning. In 1896 the [[Berthold Type Foundry]] released its [[Akzidenz Grotesk]] Typeface in an attempt to capture an objective style, and from that point the International Typographic style evolved as a modernist graphic movement that sought to convey messages clearly and in a universally straightforward manner. Two major Swiss design schools are responsible for the early years of International Typographic Style. A graphic design technique based on grid-work that began in the 19th century became inspiration for modifying the foundational course at the [[Schule für Gestaltung Basel|Basel School of Design]] in 1908. Shortly thereafter, in 1918 Ernst Keller became a professor at the [[Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich]] and began developing a graphic design and typography course. He did not teach a specific style to his students, rather he taught a philosophy of style that dictated “the solution to the design problem should emerge from its content.”&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of the solution to the design emerging from the problem itself was a reaction to previous artistic processes focused on "beauty for the sake of beauty" or "the creation of beauty as a purpose in and of itself". Keller’s work uses simple geometric forms, vibrant colors and evocative imagery to further elucidate the meaning behind each design. Other early pioneers include Théo Ballmer and [[Max Bill]].

The 1950s saw the distillation of International Typographic Style elements into sans-serif font families such as [[Univers]]. Univers paved the way for [[Max Miedinger]] and collaborator Edouard Hoffman to design the typeface Neue Haas Grotesk, which would be later renamed [[Helvetica]]. The goal with Helvetica was to create a pure typeface that could be applied to longer texts and that was highly readable. The movement began to coalesce after a periodical publication began in 1959 titled New Graphic Design, which was edited by several influential designers who played major roles in the development of International Typographic Style. The format of the journal represented many of the important elements of the style—visually demonstrating the content—and was published internationally, thus spreading the movement beyond Switzerland’s borders. One of the editors, [[Josef Müller-Brockmann]], “sought an absolute and universal form of graphic expression through objective and impersonal presentation, communicating to the audience without the interference of the designer’s subjective feelings or propagandist techniques of persuasion.”&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Müller-Brockmann’s feature large photographs as objective symbols meant to convey his ideas in particularly clear and powerful ways.

After World War II international trade began to increase and relations between countries grew steadily stronger. Typography and design were crucial to helping these relationships progress—clarity, objectivity, region-less glyphs, and symbols are essential to communication between international partners. International Typographic Style found its niche in this communicative climate and expanded further beyond Switzerland, to America.

One of the first American designers to integrate Swiss design with his own was [[Rudolph de Harak]].&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of International Typographic Style on de Harak’s own works can be seen in his many book jacket designs for McGraw-Hill publishers in the 1960s. Each jacket shows the book title and author, often aligned with a grid—flush left, ragged-right. One striking image covers most of the jacket, elucidating the theme of the particular book. International Typographic Style was embraced by corporations and institutions in America from the 1960s on, for almost two decades. One institution particularly devoted to the style was [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated movements ==
During 1900s other design based movements were formulating, influencing and influenced by the International Typographic movement. These movements emerged within the relationships between artistic fields including architecture, literature, graphic design, painting, sculpting etc.

[[De Stijl]] was a Dutch artistic movement that saw prominence in the period between 1917-1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = .. :: The International Typographic Style Timeline :: ..|url = http://smearedblackink.com/swiss_style_timeline/|website = smearedblackink.com|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to as neoplasticism, this artistic strategy sought to reflect a new Utopian ideal of spiritual harmony and order. It was a form of pure abstraction through reduction to the essentials of form and colour, employing vertical and horizontal layouts using only black and white and primary colors. Proponents of this movement included painters like [[Piet Mondrian]], Vilmes Huszar and Bart van der Hoff as well as architects like [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff|Robert van't Hoff]] and [[Jacobus_Oud|J.J.P. Oud]].

[[Bauhaus]] was a German-based movement that emphasized purity of geometry, absence of ornamentation and the motto 'form follows function'. This was a school of thought that combined craftsmaking with the fine arts and was founded by [[Walter Gropius]]. The goal was to work towards the essence of the form follows function relationship to facilitate a style that could be applied to all design problems; the International Style.

[[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] was an art/architectural philosophy that emerged from Russia in 1920s. The style develops by assorted mechanical objects that are combined into abstract mobile structural forms. Hallmarks of the movement include geometric reduction, photo-montage and simplified palettes.

[[Suprematism]], which arose in 1913, is another Russian art movement similarly focused on the simplification and purity of geometric forms to speak to values of spirituality.

All of these movements including the International Typographic styles are defined by reductionist purity as a visually compelling strategy of conveying messages through geometric and color based hierarchies.

== Notes on theory ==
The Bauhaus mantra of 'form follows function' applies to design in the spirit of the International Typographic movement. The movement was structured by focusing on detail, precision, craft skill, systems of education and approach, technical training, high standards of print and the innovative application of lettering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Swiss Style: The Principles, the Typefaces &amp; the Designers - Print Magazine|url = http://www.printmag.com/typography/swiss-style-principles-typefaces-designers/|website = Print Magazine|accessdate = 2015-12-12|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory revolves around critically approaching the development of a system specific to the design problem presented.

For example, a father of the style Ernst Keller argued that a design solution should always be respectful of its content.

A good comparison is the structure that defines a math problem. You only use specific equations for specific types of problems. You similarly only can work through these equations in specific ways. With the International Typographic and other related philosophies, a design context is critical to deriving a response.

==Characteristics of style==
Each design done with International Typographic Style in mind begins with a mathematical grid, because a grid is the “most legible and harmonious means for structuring information.”&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Text is then applied, most often aligned flush left, ragged right. Fonts chosen for the text are sans serif, a type style believed to “[express] the spirit of a more progressive age” by early designers in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Objective photography is another design element meant to present information clearly, and without any of the persuading influences of propaganda or commercial advertising. Such a strong focus on order and clarity is drawn from early pioneers of the movement believing that design is a “socially useful and important activity... the designers define their roles not as artists but as objective conduits for spreading important information between components of society.” &lt;ref&gt;Meggs, P. B., Purvis, A. W., &amp; Meggs, P. B.. ''Meggs' History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2006, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Limit state design''' ('''LSD'''), also known as '''load and resistance factor design''' ('''LRFD'''), refers to a design method used in [[structural engineering]]. A '''limit state''' is a condition of a structure beyond which it no longer fulfills the relevant design criteria.&lt;ref name="EN1990"&gt;EN 1990:2002 E, Eurocode - Basis of Structural Design, CEN, November 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The condition may refer to a degree of [[Structural load|loading]] or other actions on the structure, while the criteria refer to structural integrity, fitness for use, durability or other design requirements. A structure designed by LSD is proportioned to sustain all actions likely to occur during its design life, and to remain fit for use, with an appropriate level of [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] for each limit state. Building codes based on LSD implicitly define the appropriate levels of reliability by their prescriptions.

The method of limit state design, developed in the USSR and based on research led by Professor N.S. Streletski, was introduced in USSR building regulations in 1955.

==Criteria==
Limit state [[design]] requires the [[structure]] to satisfy two principal criteria: the [[ultimate limit]] state (ULS) and the [[serviceability limit]] state (SLS).&lt;ref&gt;[[#McCormac2008|McCormac 2008]], p. 50. ''"The term limit state is used to describe a condition at which a structure or part of a structure ceases to perform its intended function. There are two categories of limit states: strength and serviceability."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Any design process involves a number of assumptions. The [[Structural load|load]]s to which a structure will be subjected must be estimated, sizes of members to check must be chosen and design criteria must be selected. All engineering design criteria have a common goal: that of ensuring a safe structure and ensuring the functionality of the structure.

==Ultimate limit state (ULS)==
A clear distinction is made between the ultimate state (US) and the ultimate limit state (ULS). The US is a physical situation that involves either excessive deformations leading and approaching collapse of the component under consideration or the structure as a whole, as relevant, or deformations exceeding pre-agreed values. It involves, of course, considerable inelastic (plastic) behavior of the structural scheme and residual deformations. While the ULS is not a physical situation but rather an agreed computational condition that must be fulfilled, among other additional criteria, in order to comply with the engineering demands for strength and stability under design loads. The ULS condition is computationally checked at a certain point along the behavior function of the structural scheme, located at the upper part of its elastic zone at approximately 15% lower than the elastic limit. That means that the ULS is a purely elastic condition, located on the behavior function far below the real Ultimate point, which is located deep within the plastic zone. The rationale for choosing the ULS at the upper part of the elastic zone is that as long as the ULS design criteria are fulfilled, the structure will behave in the same way under repetitive loadings, and as long as it keeps this way, it proves that the level of safety and reliability assumed as the basis for this design is properly maintained and justified, (following the probabilistic safety approach). A structure is deemed to satisfy the ultimate limit state criterion if all factored [[bending]], [[shear stress|shear]] and [[Tensile stress|tensile]] or [[Compressive stress|compressive]] stresses are below the factored resistances calculated for the section under consideration. The factored stresses referred to are found by applying Magnification Factors to the loads on the section. Reduction Factors are applied to determine the various factored resistances of the section.

The limit state criteria can also be set in terms of load rather than stress: using this approach the structural element being analysed (i.e. a [[beam (structure)|beam]] or a [[column]] or other load bearing elements, such as walls) is shown to be safe when the "Magnified" loads are less than the relevant "Reduced" resistances.

Complying with the design criteria of the ULS is considered as the minimum requirement (among other additional demands) to provide the proper structural safety.

==Serviceability limit state (SLS)==
1) limit state of deflection

2) limit state of cracking

3) limit state of vibration

In addition to the ULS check mentioned above, a Service Limit State (SLS) computational check must be performed. As for the ULS, here also the SLS is not a physical situation but rather a computational check. The aim is to prove that under the action of Characteristic design loads (un-factored), and/or whilst applying certain (un-factored) magnitudes of imposed deformations, settlements, or vibrations, or temperature gradients etc. the structural behavior complies with, and does not exceed, the SLS design criteria values, specified in the relevant standard in force. These criteria involve various stress limits, deformation limits (deflections, rotations and curvature), flexibility (or rigidity) limits, dynamic behavior limits, as well as crack control requirements (crack width) and other arrangements concerned with the durability of the structure and its level of everyday service level and human comfort achieved, and its abilities to fulfill its everyday functions. In view of non-structural issues it might also involve limits applied to acoustics and heat transmission that might also affect the structural design. To satisfy the serviceability limit state criterion, a structure must remain functional for its intended use subject to routine (read: everyday) loading, and as such the structure must not cause [[occupant discomfort]] under routine conditions. This calculation check is performed at a point located at the lower half of the elastic zone, where characteristic (un-factored) actions are applied and the structural behavior is purely elastic.

==Factor development==
The load and resistance factors are determined using statistics and a pre-selected probability of failure. Variability in the quality of construction, consistency of the construction material are accounted for in the factors. Generally, a factor of unity (one) or less is applied to the resistances of the material, and a factor of unity or greater to the loads. Not often used, but in some load cases a factor may be less than unity due to a reduced probability of the combined loads. These factors can differ significantly for different materials or even between differing grades of the same material. Wood and masonry typically have smaller factors than concrete, which in turn has smaller factors than steel. The factors applied to resistance also account for the degree of scientific confidence in the derivation of the values — i.e. smaller values are used when there isn't much research on the specific type of failure mode). Factors associated with loads are normally independent on the type of material involved, but can be influenced by the type of construction.

In determining the specific magnitude of the factors, more deterministic loads (like dead loads, the weight of the structure and permanent attachments like walls, floor treatments, ceiling finishes) are given lower factors (for example 1.4) than highly variable loads like earthquake, wind, or live (occupancy) loads (1.6). Impact loads are typically given higher factors still (say 2.0) in order to account for both their unpredictable magnitudes and the dynamic nature of the loading vs. the static nature of most models. While arguably not philosophically superior to permissible or [[allowable stress design]], it does have the potential to produce a more consistently designed structure as each element is intended to have the same probability of failure. In practical terms this normally results in a more efficient structure, and as such, it can be argued that LSD is superior from a practical engineering viewpoint.
==Example treatment of LSD in building codes==
The following is the treatment of LSD found in the [[National Building Code of Canada]]:

 NBCC 1995 Format
 φR &gt; α&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;D + ψ γ {α&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;L + α&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;Q + α&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;T}

 where φ = Resistance Factor
       ψ = Load Combination Factor
       γ = Importance Factor
       α&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = Dead Load Factor
       α&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Live Load Factor
       α&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt; = Earthquake Load Factor
       α&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = Thermal Effect (Temperature) Load Factor

Limit state design has replaced the older concept of [[permissible stress design]] in most forms of [[civil engineering]]. A notable exception is [[transportation engineering]]. Even so, new codes are currently being developed for both geotechnical and transportation engineering which are LSD based. As a result, most modern buildings are designed in accordance with a code which is based on limit state theory. For example, in Europe, structures are designed to conform with the [[Eurocode]]s: [[Steel]] structures are designed in accordance with [[EN 1993]], and [[reinforced concrete]] structures to [[EN 1992]]. Australia, Canada, China, France, Indonesia, and New Zealand (among many others) utilise limit state theory in the development of their design codes. In the purest sense, it is now considered inappropriate to discuss [[safety factor]]s when working with LSD, as there are concerns that this may lead to confusion.

==In the United States==
The United States has been particularly slow to adopt limit state design (known as Load and Resistance Factor Design in the US). Design codes and standards are issued by diverse organizations, some of which have adopted limit state design, and others have not.

The [[ACI 318 Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete]] uses Limit State design.

The ANSI/[[AISC 360 Specification for Structural Steel Buildings]], the ANSI/[[AISI S-100 North American Specification for the Design of Cold Formed Steel Structural Members]], and [[The Aluminum Association]]'s [[Aluminum Design Manual]] contain two methods of design side by side:  
# Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD), a Limit States Design implementation, and
# Allowable Strength Design (ASD), a method where the nominal strength is divided by a safety factor to determine the allowable strength. This allowable strength is required to equal or exceed the required strength for a set of ASD load combinations. ASD is calibrated to give the same structural reliability and component size as the LRFD method with a live to dead load ratio of 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Steel Construction Manual Fourteenth Edition|year=2011|publisher=AISC|isbn=1-56424-060-6 |pages=16.1–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, when structures have a live to dead load ratio that differs from 3, ASD produces designs that are either less reliable or less efficient as compared to designs resulting from the LRFD method.

In contrast, the ANSI/[[AWWA D100 Welded Carbon Steel Tanks for Water Storage]] and [[API 650 Welded Tanks for Oil Storage]] still use [[allowable stress design]].

==In Europe==
In Europe, the limit state design is enforced by the [[Eurocodes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2894">{{external links|date=November 2018}}The '''Malaysia Nuclear Agency (Agensi Nuklear Malaysia, ANM)''' is a [[Malaysia]]n [[nuclear technology]] research facility located in [[Bangi, Malaysia|Bangi]], [[Selangor]].

ANM introduces and promotes the application of nuclear science and technology for national development.

== History ==
Established on 19 September 1972, ANM was then known as the Centre for Application of Nuclear Malaysia (CRANE). It was formally named Tun Ismail Atomic Research Centre (PUSPATI).

In June 1983, PUSPATI was placed under the patronage of the Prime Minister and was called Nuclear Energy Unit (UTN). It was placed under Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment in October 1990. In August 1994, its name was changed to Malaysian Institute for Nuclear Technology Research (MINT).

On 28 September 2006, following its restructuring, MINT was given a new identity,which is Malaysian Nuclear Agency. Its strategic location, near higher learning institutions. It is in close proximity to the National Administration Centre, Putrajaya, and the Multimedia Super Corridor, Cyberjaya.

The rebranding followed mass restructuring and the re-alignment of its core business towards establishing nuclear power in Malaysia as an alternative form of renewable energy.

'''Max Horkheimer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɔːr|k|ˌ|h|aɪ|m|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈhɔɐ̯kˌhaɪmɐ|lang}}; February 14, 1895 – July 7, 1973) was a German [[philosopher]] and [[sociologist]] who was famous for his work in [[critical theory]] as a member of the '[[Frankfurt School]]' of social research. Horkheimer addressed [[authoritarianism]], militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis, and the poverty of [[mass culture]] using the philosophy of history as a framework. This became the foundation of critical theory. His most important works include ''[[Eclipse of Reason (Horkheimer)|Eclipse of Reason]]'' (1947), ''Between Philosophy and Social Science'' (1930–1938) and, in collaboration with [[Theodor Adorno]], ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1947). Through the Frankfurt School, Horkheimer planned, supported and made other significant works possible.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"&gt;"Horkheimer, Max". ''Dictionary of the Social Sciences''.

==Biography==
===Early life===
On February 14, 1895, Horkheimer was born the only son of Moritz and Babetta Horkheimer. Horkheimer was born into a conservative, wealthy [[Orthodox Jewish]] family. His father was a successful businessman who owned several textile factories in the Zuffenhausen district of [[Stuttgart]], where Max was born.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Berendzen, J.C., "Max Horkheimer", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/horkheimer/]&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Moritz expected his son to follow in his footsteps and own the family business.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Max was taken out of school in 1910 to work in the family business, where he eventually became a junior manager. During this period he would begin two relationships that would last for the rest of his life. First, he met Friedrich Pollock, who would later become a close academic colleague, and who would remain Max's closest friend. He also met Rose Riekher, who was his father's personal secretary. Eight years Max's senior, a gentile, and of an economically lower class, Riekher (whom Max called "Maidon") was not considered a suitable match by Moritz Horkheimer. Despite this, Max and Maidon would marry in 1926 and remain together until her death in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/horkheimer/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Berendzen|first=J.C.|date=2013-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, his manufacturing career ended and his chances of taking over his family business were interrupted when he was drafted into [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"&gt;Reason, Nostalgia, and Eschatology in the Critical Theory of Max Horkheimer Brian J. Shaw The Journal of Politics, Vol. 47, No. 1 (Feb., 1985), pp. 160–181.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Horkheimer was denied service on medical grounds.

===Education===
In the spring of 1919, after failing an army physical,&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Horkheimer enrolled at [[Munich University]]. While living in Munich, he was mistaken for the revolutionary playwright Ernst Toller and arrested and imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Horkheimer, Max - Oxford Reference|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199532919.001.0001/acref-9780199532919-e-330|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being released, Horkheimer moved to [[Frankfurt am Main]], where he studied [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] under the respectable [[Hans Cornelius]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; There, he met [[Theodor Adorno]], several years his junior, with whom he would strike a lasting friendship and a collaborative relationship. After an abortive attempt at writing a dissertation on gestalt [[psychology]], Horkheimer, with Cornelius's direction, completed his doctorate in [[philosophy]] with a 78-page dissertation titled ''The Antinomy of Teleological Judgment'' (''Zur Antinomie der teleologischen Urteilskraft'').&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sica 2005"&gt;Sica, Alan. ''Social Thought: From the Enlightenment to The Present''. Pennsylvania State University: Pearson, Inc. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, Horkheimer was [[habilitation|habilitated]] with a dissertation entitled ''Kant's Critique of Judgement as Mediation between Practical and Theoretical Philosophy'' (''Über Kants Kritik der Urteilskraft als Bindeglied zwischen theoretischer und praktischer Philosophie''). Here, he met [[Friedrich Pollock]] who would be his colleague at the Institute of Social Research. The following year, Max was appointed ''[[Privatdozent]].'' Shortly after, in 1926, Horkheimer married Rose Riekher.&lt;ref name="Sica 2005"/&gt;

===Institute of Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung)===
In 1926 Horkheimer was an "unsalaried lecturer in Frankfurt." Shortly after, in 1930, he was promoted to professor of philosophy at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]]. In the same year, when the [[Institute for Social Research]]'s (now known as Frankfurt School of Critical Theory) directorship became vacant, after the departure of [[Carl Grünberg]], Horkheimer was elected to the position "by means of an endowment from a wealthy businessman".&lt;ref name="Sica, Alan 2005"&gt;Sica, Alan., ed. 2005. Social Thought: From the Enlightenment to the Present. Boston, MA: Pearson Education, Inc. p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute had had its beginnings in a [[Marxist]] study group started by [[Felix Weil]], a one-time student of political science at Frankfurt who used his inheritance to fund the group as a way to support his leftist academic aims.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Pollock and Horkheimer were partners with Weil in the early activities of the Institute.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

Horkheimer worked to make the Institute a purely academic enterprise.&lt;ref name="Callinicos, Alex T 2007"&gt;Callinicos, Alex T. 2007. Social Theory: A Historical Introduction. 2nd ed. Cambridge, UK: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As director, he changed Frankfurt from an orthodox Marxist school to a heterodox school for critical social research .&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Anthony and Larry Ray. ed. 2003. Key Contemporary Social Theorists. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers Ltd. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year publication of the Institute's ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' began, with Horkheimer as its editor.&lt;ref name="marxists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/o.htm#horkheimer-max |title=Glossary of People: Ho |publisher=marxists.org|accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer intellectually reoriented the Institute, proposing a programme of collective research aimed at specific social groups (specifically the working class) that would highlight the problem of the relationship of history and reason. The Institute focused on integrating the views of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. The Frankfurt School attempted this by systematically hitching together the different conceptual structures of historical materialism and psychoanalysis.

During the time between Horkheimer's being named Professor of Social Philosophy and director of the Institute in 1930, the Nazis became the second largest party in the Reichstag. In the midst of the violence surrounding the Nazis' rise, Horkheimer and his associates began to prepare for the possibility of moving the Institute out of Germany.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Horkheimer's ''[[venia legendi]]'' was revoked by the new [[Nazi]] government because of the Marxian nature of the Institute's ideas as well as its prominent Jewish association. When Hitler was named the Chancellor in 1933,&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; the Institute was thus forced to close its location in Germany. He emigrated to [[Geneva, Switzerland]] and then to [[New York City]] the following year, where Horkheimer met with the president of [[Columbia University]] to discuss hosting the Institute. To Horkheimer's surprise, the president agreed to host the Institute in exile as well as offer Horkheimer a building for the Institute.&lt;ref name="mit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=6063 |title=Biography of Horkheimer at MIT Press |publisher=mitpress.mit.edu |accessdate=2015-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008093915/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=6063 |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer, George. 2011. Sociological Theory. 8th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1934 Horkheimer accepted an offer from Columbia to relocate the Institute to one of their buildings.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

In 1940, Horkheimer received American citizenship and moved to the [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California|Pacific Palisades]] district of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where his collaboration with Adorno would yield the ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]].'' In 1942, Horkheimer assumed the directorship of the Scientific Division of the American Jewish Committee. In this capacity, he helped launch and organize a series of five Studies in Prejudice, which were published in 1949 and 1950. The most important of these was the pioneering study in social psychology entitled The Authoritarian Personality, itself a methodologically advanced reworking of some of the themes treated in a collective project produced by the Institute in its first years of exile, Studies in Authority and Family.&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Martin. "Max Horkheimer (1895-1973)." ''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'' 47 (1973): 219-20. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/3129918&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, Horkheimer did not publish much, although he continued to edit ''Studies in Philosophy and Social Science'' as a continuation of the ''Zeitschrift.'' In 1949, he returned to Frankfurt where the Institute for Social Research reopened in 1950. Between 1951 and 1953 Horkheimer was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]]. In 1953, Horkheimer stepped down from director of the Institute and took on a smaller role in the Institute, while Adorno became director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffst.hr/ENCYCLOPAEDIA/horkheimer.htm Biography of Horkheimer at University of Haifa]&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer and Adorno were seen as the fathers of the Institute.

===Later years===
Horkheimer continued to teach at the University until his retirement in the mid-1960s. In 1953, he was awarded the Goethe Plaque of the City of Frankfurt, and was later named honorary citizen of Frankfurt for life.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/horkheimer/|title=Max Horkheimer (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|publisher=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to America in 1954 and 1959 to lecture as a frequent visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago]].

===Legacy===
He remained an important figure until his death in [[Nuremberg]] in 1973. Max Horkheimer with the help of Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, Leo Lowenthal, Otto Kirchheimer, Frederick Pollock and Neumann developed "Critical Theory". According to Larry Ray "Critical Theory" has "become one of the most influential social theories of the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Anthony and Larry Ray (eds.). 2003. Key Contemporary Social Theorists. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers Ltd. p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horkheimer's thought==
{{Frankfurt School}}

Horkheimer's work is marked by a concern to show the relation between affect (especially suffering) and concepts (understood as action-guiding expressions of reason). In this, he responded critically to what he saw as the one-sidedness of both [[neo-Kantianism]] (with its focus on concepts) and ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' (with its focus on expression and [[World disclosure|world-disclosure]]). Horkheimer did not think either was wrong, but insisted that the insights of each school on their own could not adequately contribute to the repair of social problems. Horkheimer focused on the connections between social structures, networks/subcultures, and individual realities, concluding that we are affected and shaped by the proliferation of products on the market place. It is also important to note that Horkheimer collaborated with Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"/&gt;

===Critical theory===
Through [[critical theory]] (a social theory focusing on critiquing and changing society), Horkheimer "attempted to revitalize radical social, and cultural criticism" and discussed authoritarianism, militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis and the poverty of mass culture.&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"/&gt; Horkheimer helped to create Critical Theory through a mix of radical and conservative lenses that stem from radical Marxism and end up in "pessimistic Jewish transcendentalism".&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"/&gt; Horkheimer developed his critical theory by examining his own wealth while witnessing the juxtaposition of the bourgeois and the impoverished. This critical theory embraced the future possibilities of society and was preoccupied with forces which moved society toward rational institutions that would ensure a true, free, and just life.&lt;ref name="Held, David 1980"&gt;Held, David. 1980. Introduction to Critical Theory: Horkheimer to Habermas. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He was convinced of the need to "examine the entire material and spiritual culture of mankind"&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"/&gt; in order to transform society as a whole. Horkheimer sought to enable the working class to reclaim their power in order to resist the lure of fascism. Horkheimer stated himself that "the rationally organized society that regulates its own existence" was necessary along with a society that could "satisfy common needs".&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"/&gt; To satisfy these needs, it would need to engage with the social conditions within which people lived and in which their concepts and actions were formed. It reached out for a total understanding of history and knowledge. Through this, critical theory develops a "critique of bourgeois society through which 'ideology critique' attempted to locate the 'utopian content' of dominant systems of thought".&lt;ref name="Elliott 1996"&gt;Elliott, Anthony and Larry Ray, ed. 1996. Key Contemporary Social Theorists. Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, critical theory sought to develop a critical perspective in the discussion of all social practices.&lt;ref name="Held, David 1980"/&gt;

=== Writing ===
==== ''Eclipse of Reason'' ====
{{Main|Eclipse of Reason (Horkheimer)}}
Horkheimer's book, ''Eclipse of Reason'', published in 1947, is broken into five sections: Means and Ends, Conflicting Panaceas, The Revolt of Nature, The Rise and Decline of the Individual, and On the Concept of Philosophy.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com" /&gt; The 'Eclipse of Reason focuses on the concept of reason within the history of [[western philosophy]], which can only be fostered in an environment of free, critical thinking while also linking positivist and instrumental reason with the rise of fascism.&lt;ref name="Elliott 1996" /&gt; He distinguishes between [[objectivity (science)|objective]], [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Instrumental rationality|instrumental]] reason, and states that we have moved from the former through the center and into the latter (though subjective and instrumental reason are closely connected). Objective reason deals with universal truths that dictate that an action is either right or wrong. It is a concrete concept and a force in the world that requires specific modes of behavior. The focus in the objective faculty of reason is on the ends, rather than the means. Subjective reason is an abstract concept of reason, and focuses primarily on means. Specifically, the reasonable nature of the purpose of action is irrelevant – the ends only serve the purpose of the subject (generally self-advancement or preservation). To be "reasonable" in this context is to be suited to a particular purpose, to be "good for something else". This aspect of reason is universally conforming, and easily furnishes [[ideology]]. In instrumental reason, the sole criterion of reason is its operational value or purposefulness, and with this, the idea of truth becomes contingent on mere subjective preference (hence the relation with subjective reason). Because subjective/instrumental reason rules, the [[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]] of a society, for example [[democratic ideals]], become dependent on the "interests" of the people instead of being dependent on objective truths. In his writing Horkheimer states, "Social power is today more than ever mediated by power over things. The more intense an individual's concern with power over things, the more will things dominate him, the more will he lack any genuine individual traits, and the more will his mind be transformed into an automation of formalized reason."&lt;ref&gt;Sica, Alan 2005. "Social Thought : From the Enlightenment to The Present." (p. 542-546). Pennsylvania State University: Pearson, Inc."&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Horkheimer admits that objective reason has its roots in Reason ("[[Logos]]" in Greek) of the subject. He concludes, "If by enlightenment and intellectual progress we mean the freeing of man from superstitious belief in evil forces, in demons and fairies, in blind fate – in short, the emancipation from fear – then denunciation of what is currently called reason is the greatest service we can render."&lt;ref&gt;Eclipse of Reason, Seabury Press, 1974 [1941]. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=nuzj9LLrKlgC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=max+horkheimer#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title=Eclipse of Reason| isbn=9780826400093| last1=Horkheimer| first1=Max| date=1974-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Horkheimer outlined how the [[Nazis]] had been able to make their agenda appear "reasonable", but also issued a warning about the possibility of a similar occurrence happening again. Horkheimer believed that the illnesses of modern society are caused by misunderstanding reason: if people use true reason to critique their societies, they will be able to solve problems they may have.

Despite the explicit common referrals to "subjective" reason in the book, his frequent connecting of it with [[relativism]] could be an indication that by "subjective reason" Horkheimer also means "relativist reason".

==== Between philosophy and social science ====
"Between Philosophy and Social Science" appeared between 1930 and 1938, during the time the Frankfurt school moved from Frankfurt to Geneva to Columbia University. It included: "Materialism and Morality", "The Present Situation of Moral Philosophy and the Tasks of an Institute for Social Research", "On the Problem of Truth", "Egoism and the Freedom Movement", "History and Psychology", "A New Concept of Ideology", "Remarks on Philosophical Anthropology", and "The Rationalism Debate in Contemporary Philosophy". It also included "The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks for an Institute of Social Research", "Egoism and Freedom Movements" and "Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History". The essays within "Between Philosophy and Social Science" were Horkheimer's attempts to "remove the individual from mass culture, a function for philosophy from the [[commodification]] of everything".&lt;ref name="G. Regier MLN 1995 pp. 953-957"&gt;W. G. Regier MLN, Vol. 110, No. 4, Comparative Literature Issue (Sep., 1995), pp. 953-957 Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer was extremely invested in the individual. In one of his writings, he states, "When we speak of an individual as a historical entity, we mean not merely the space-time and the sense existence of a particular member of the human race, but in addition, his awareness of his own individuality as a conscious human being, including recognition of his own identity.".&lt;ref&gt;Sica, Alan. 2005. "Social Thought : From the Enlightenment to The Present". (p. 542-546). Pennsylvania State University: Pearson, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer was a strong believer in individuals becoming aware of themselves and their conscious as human beings. This is important to Horkheimer because for workers, he is aware of individuals losing their identity in products, which affects the power an individual may have of him/herself.&lt;ref&gt;Lemert, Charles. 2010. "Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings." (p. 208-212). Westview Press, A Member of the Perseus Books Group&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks for an Institute of Social Research" was not only included in this volume, but it was also used as Horkheimer's inaugural speech as director of the Frankfurt School. In this speech he related economic groups to the struggles and challenges of real life. Horkheimer often referenced human struggle and used this example in his speech because it was a topic he understood well.&lt;ref name="G. Regier MLN 1995 pp. 953-957" /&gt;

"Egoism and Freedom Movements" and "Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History" are the longest of the essays. The first is an evaluation of Machiavelli, Hobbes and Vico; the latter discusses the bourgeois control. In Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History, Horkheimer explained "what he learned from the bourgeois rise to power and what of the bourgeois he thought was worth preserving.&lt;ref name="G. Regier MLN 1995 pp. 953-957" /&gt;

The volume also looks at the individual as the "troubled center of philosophy." Horkheimer expressed that "there is no formula that defines the relationship among individuals, society and nature for all time".&lt;ref name="G. Regier MLN 1995 pp. 953-957" /&gt; To understand the problem of the individual further, Horkheimer included two case studies on the individual: one on Montaigne and one on himself.

==== ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' ====
Max Horkheimer and [[Theodor Adorno]] collaborated to publish ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'', which was originally published in 1944. The inspiration for this piece came from when Horkheimer and Adorno had to flee Germany, because of Hitler, and go to New York. They went to America and "absorbed the popular culture"; thinking that it was a form of totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Douglas. 2008. "Slamming Society: Critical Theory and Situationism." p.106 in ''Understanding Society: A Survey of Modern Social Theory''. Don Mills&lt;!--publisher--&gt;; Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Dialectic of Enlightenment's main argument was to serve as a wide-ranging critique of the "self-destruction of enlightenment".&lt;ref name="Elliott 1996" /&gt; The work criticized popular culture as "the product of a culture industry whose goal was to stupefy the masses with endless mass produced copies of the same thing" (Lembert). Along with that, Horkheimer and Adorno had a few arguments; one being that these mass-produced products only appear to change over time. Horkheimer and Adorno stated that these products were so standardized in order to help consumers comprehend and appreciate the products with little attention given to them. They expressed, "the result is a constant reproduction of the same thing" (Adorno and Horkheimer, 1993 [1944]). However, they also explain how pseudo-individuality is encouraged among these products in order to keep the consumers coming back for more. They argue that small differences in products within the same area are acceptable.&lt;ref name="Lembert, Charles 2010"&gt;Lembert, Charles. 2010. ''Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings''. 4th ed. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The similar patterns found in the content of popular culture (films, popular songs and radio) have the same central message; "it's all linked to "the necessity of obedience of the masses to the social hierarchy in place in advanced capitalist societies".&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Douglas. 2008. "Slamming Society: Critical Theory and Situationism." p. 107 in ''Understanding Society: A Survey of Modern Social Theory''. Don Mills&lt;!--publisher--&gt;; Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These products appeal to the masses and encourage conformity to the consumers. In return, capitalism remains in power while buyers continue to consume from the industry. This is dangerous because the consumers' belief that the powers of technology are liberating, starts to increase. To support their claim, Horkheimer and Adorno, "proposed an antidote: not just thinking the relations of things, but also, as an immediate second step, thinking through that thinking, self-reflectively". In other words, technology lacks self-reflectivity. Nonetheless, Horkheimer and Adorno believed that art was an exception because it "is an open-ended system with no fixed rules"; thus, it could not be an object of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Noel and Stuart Sim., ed. 1997. The A Guide to Modern Social and Political Theorists. Prentice Hall: London. pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[Perry Anderson]] sees Horkheimer's attempt to make the Institute purely academic as "symptomatic of a more universal process, the emergence of a 'Western Marxism' divorced from the working-class movement and dominated by academic philosophers and the 'product of defeat'" because of the isolation of the Russian Revolution. Rolf Wiggerhaus, author of ''The Frankfurt School'' believed Horkheimer lacked the audacious theoretical construction produced by those like Marx and Lukács and that his main argument was that those living in misery had the right to material egoism. In his book, "Social Theory", Alex Callinicos claims that ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' offers no systematic account of conception of rationality, but rather professes objective reason intransigently to an extent.&lt;ref name="Callinicos, Alex T 2007"/&gt; Charles Lemert discusses in his book ''Social Theory'' that in writing ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'', Horkheimer and Adorno lack sufficient sympathy for the cultural plight of the average working person, unfair to criticize the tastes of ordinary people, and that popular culture does not really buttress social conformity and stabilize capitalism as much as the Frankfurt school thinks.&lt;ref name="Lembert, Charles 2010"/&gt;

'''Mutual monogamy''' is a form of [[monogamy]] that exists when two partners agree to be [[Human sexual activity|sexually active]] with only one another. Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship reduces the risk of acquiring a [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/features/girlfriendshealth/index.html|title=Girlfriends' Health|date=22 April 2017|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most reliable ways to avoid STIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/final-evidence-review40/gonorrhea-screening|title=Final Evidence Review: Gonorrhea: Screening - US Preventive Services Task Force|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Home/GetFile/1/1703/sties114final/pdf|title=Evidence Synthesis Number 114, Behavioral Sexual Risk Reduction Counseling in Primary Care to Prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections: An Updated Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|date=September 2014|publisher=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/PID/STDFact-PID.htm|title=Pelvic Inflammatory Disease - CDC Fact Sheet|date=2017-10-04|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who choose mutual monogamy can be tested before the sexual relationship to be certain they are not infected.  This strategy for the prevention of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection requires that each partner remain [[Faithfulness|faithful]] and does not engage in sexual activity with another partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2005/many-men-choose-monogamy-prevent-sexually-transmitted-diseases|title=Many Men Choose Monogamy To Prevent Sexually Transmitted Diseases|date=22 September 2005|publisher=Guttmacher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutual monogamy differs from serial monogamy which is a current monogamous relationship that has not been established in the past and may not continue into the future. Serial monogamy may not result in the reduced risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection because the past sexual exposures to infection are brought into the new relationship, even though it may be exclusive of other sexual partners. The risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection while in a serial monogamous relationship is the same as the risk of those who have concurrent partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdD4RS0DqUYC&amp;pg=PT491&amp;lpg=PT491&amp;dq=Mutual+Monogamy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZpebpEnuXs&amp;sig=Q_wrDZWWE1mACFYlvJYYZ6XZoqw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLiYrZ6IbYAhUE8IMKHRzHBQ84ChDoAQhKMAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Mutual+Monogamy&amp;f=false|title=Preventive Dermatology|first=Robert A.|last=Norman|date=25 June 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with a greater ability to communicate about their commitment are likely to sustain the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=One love: explicit monogamy agreements among heterosexual young adult couples at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections|first1=Jocelyn T.|last1=Warren|first2=S.

When individuals are mutually monogamous, and are free from STIs/[[HIV]] when they enter the relationship, the risk for being infected with STI/HIV acquisition from sexual intercourse is very low.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Romantic Relationship Dynamics of Urban African American Adolescents: Patterns of Monogamy, Commitment, and Trust|first1=Senna L.|last1=Towner|first2=M. Margaret|last2=Dolcini|first3=Gary W.|last3=Harper|date=1 May 2015|journal=Youth &amp; Society|volume=47|issue=3|pages=343–373|doi=10.1177/0044118X12462591|pmid=26691404|pmc=4681523}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mutually monogomous relationship lowers the risk of HIV, [[Cervicitis|cervicitis]], and other sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/cervicitis.page|title=Cervicitis|publisher=New York City Health Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mutual monogomous sexual relationship often includes a pledge to stay with the partner and includes the desire for the relationship to last, a psychological attachment and the lack of being able to find another partner. If these conditions remain a priority for both, the "couple is likely committed and mutually monogamous."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and has negative STI test lowers the chance of acquiring [[gonorrhea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/sexually-transmitted-infections/gonorrhea/index.html|title=Gonorrhea|date=17 August 2016|publisher=Health and Human Services }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also effective for lowering the risk of [[syphilis]], [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and [[Crab louse|pubic lice]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.pa.gov/My%20Health/Diseases%20and%20Conditions/Q-T/14242L/Pages/557969.aspx#.WjEVQ0qnE2w&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/sexually-transmitted-infections/syphilis/index.html|title=Syphilis|date=17 August 2016|publisher=Health and Human Services}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/sexually-transmitted-infections/chlamydia/index.html|title=Chlamydia|date=17 August 2016|publisher=Health and Human Services}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/crabs|title=Crabs - IDPH|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dph.illinois.gov|publisher=Illinois Department of Health|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of a more precise definition of mutual monogamy in the literature confounds the ability to statistically assess its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is monogamy or committed relationship status a marker for low sexual risk among men in substance abuse treatment?

The '''National Standard Examination in Chemistry''' or NSEC is an examination in chemistry for higher secondary school students in [[India]], usually conducted in the end of November. The examination is organized by the Indian Association of Chemistry Teachers. Over 30,000 students, mainly from Standard 12, sit for this examination.

==Eligibility==

The examination is intended for students in 12th standard, though 11th standard students are also allowed to take the examination.

==Importance==

The top 1% students from this examination are selected to sit for the [[Indian National Chemistry Olympiad]]. The theory part of the examination is held in the last week of January. The top 30 among all students are selected for the Orientation-Cum-Selection-Camp (OCSC), Chemistry.

==Format==

The NSEC comprises only [[multiple choice question]]s. The questions include physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and inorganic chemistry. The stress on biochemistry is more in the NSEC than in the typical school syllabi.

==Fee==

As per the new revised norms the fee for the NSEC is about Rs. 100. Application for this examination is typically handled through the school/college to which the student is affiliated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="918">The term '''''oracy''''' was coined by Andrew Wilkinson, a British researcher and educator, in the 1960s. This word is formed by analogy from [[literacy]] and [[numeracy]]. The purpose is to draw attention to the neglect of [[Speech communication|oral skills]] in [[education]].

The '''Petroleum University of Technology''' ({{lang-fa|دانشگاه صنعت نفت}}) is a leading Iranian [[Public university|public]] university funded by the [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Ministry of Petroleum]] particularly by its main company, the [[National Iranian Oil Company|NIOC]] . It was  founded in 1939 in [[Abadan]] in response to the increasing industrialization of Iran oil company, and is officially the second oldest university in Iran after [[University of Tehran]]&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt; and based on The Center for World University Rankings (CWUR), this university has the 7th worldwide rank in oil an gas sector and petroleum engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{https://cwur.org/2017/subjects.php#Engineering, Petroleum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|sure=n|reason=Reference is not a reliable website and there is no prove for the claim there.|date=September 2017}} It offers [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]], [[Master of Science|M.S]] and [[Doctorate]] programs for upstream and downstream oil and gas industry such as [[petroleum engineering]], [[chemical engineering]],  [[offshore  engineering]],  [[instrumentation engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[accounting]], and [[marine engineering]].

It has four campuses in [[Ahwaz]], [[Abadan]], [[Tehran]] and [[Mahmudabad, Mazandaran|Mahmudabad]] and some research centers.

== History ==
[[File:نمای ورود دانشکده.jpg|thumb|Ahwaz Petroleum University of Technology]]

[[File:Abadan Petroleum University.jpg|thumb|Abadan Institute of Technology in 1939]]
The name of the university has been changed several times. The university was established in 1939 in [[Abadan]] as '''Abadan Technical School'''. The academic program comprised working and studying in sequence. The students (if employed) spent two-fifth of the academic program in the school and three-fifth in the '''Abadan Refinery''' ({{lang-fa|پالايشگاه آبادان}} ''Pālāyeshgāh-e Ābādān'') as trainees.&lt;ref name="put history"/&gt;

In 1956, the name was changed to '''Abadan Technical College'''. By then, the educational program focused on the general engineering major; admissions were given to 4th grade high school students after passing an entry test and interviews. The last admissions of the program were granted in 1961 and the last students graduated in 1961.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

In 1962, the name changed to  '''Abadan Institute of Technology''' (AIT). The programs offered [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degrees in petroleum engineering, economic and administrative sciences and accounting. The programs was still internship-orientated.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

After the outbreak of the [[Iran–Iraq War|War]], the university was relocated. It was first moved to [[Gachsaran County|Gachsaran]] in 1981. The universities all over the country reopened in December 1982 and the university moved to the current location of Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum in [[Kut-e Abdollah]], [[Karun, Khuzestan|Karun County]].&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

After the [[Iran–Iraq War|War]], in 1989, the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education granted permission to found the Petroleum University of Technology. All the educational institutions of the [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Ministry of Petroleum]] are supervised by the university. [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Ministry of Petroleum]], then founded the '''Abadan Shahid Tondghuyan Faculty of Chemical and Petrochemical Engineering''' or Abadan Faculty of Petroleum in {{date|February 1992}} in the location of the former Abadan Institute of Technology and The Research Center of Petroleum University of Technology in the campus of the current Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum in 1993.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

== Today==
As of 2015, the Petroleum University of Technology consists of four faculties in cities that offer 13 [[undergraduate]], 11 [[graduate school|graduate]] and three [[doctorate]] programs:
* Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum (or PUT Ahwaz), 
* Abadan Faculty of Petroleum (or PUT Abadan),
* Tehran Faculty of Petroleum ([[N.I.O.C. school of Accounting and Finance ]]) (or PUT Tehran),
* [[Mahmudabad, Mazandaran|Mahmudabad]] Faculty of Marine Sciences (or PUT Mahmudabad).&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

The university has four research centers:
* Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum Research Center;
* Abadan Faculty of Petroleum Research Center;
* Tehran Faculty of Petroleum Research Center and,
* Mahmudabad Faculty of Marine Sciences Offshore Oil &amp; Gas Industries Research Center.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

==Roles and goals==
The priorities of the PUT are maintaining the resources of oil and gas in the country and training manpower for the development and exploitation of these resources.

== Students ==
According to the results of M.S. [[Iranian University Entrance Exam|Entrance Examinations]], PUT students are the best among other universities like [[Sharif University of Technology]] and [[Amirkabir University of Technology]] in Petroleum and Chemical Engineering, and Accounting . The university has sent some of its students to the  [[University of Calgary]], [[Curtin University of Technology]] and [[French Institute of Petroleum]] (IFP).

A student has won the bronze medal of the 9th South Eastern European Mathematical Olympiad for University Students (SEEMOUS 2015) that took place in [[Ohrid]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], from March 3–8, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=افتخارآفرینی دانشجوی دانشگاه صنعت نفت در المپیاد جهانی ریاضی|url=http://www.shana.ir/fa/newsagency/236898/%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A2%D9%81%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%AC%D9%88%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%AA-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B6%DB%8C|accessdate=13 September 2015|work=شبکه اطلاع‌رسایی نفت و انرژی|agency=شانا|date=March 10, 2015|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1333">The '''petrolingual ligament''' lies at the posteroinferior aspect of the lateral wall of the [[cavernous sinus]] and marks the point at which the [[internal carotid artery]] enters the [[cavernous sinus]].

Anatomically, the petrolingual ligament demarcates two of the segments of the internal carotid artery: 
* The petrolingual ligament marks the end of the [[petrous portion of the internal carotid artery|petrous]] section of the [[internal carotid artery]]. 
* The [[cavernous]] section of the internal carotid artery begins at the superior aspect of the petrolingual ligament.

For [[surgeons]] and [[radiologists]], it is important to be oriented to the location of this ligament in cases of possible [[dissection]] of the internal carotid artery, as it helps determine whether the dissection has occurred inside or outside the cavernous sinus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007010050086|title=The Petrolingual Ligament: The Anatomy and Surgical Exposure of the Posterolateral Landmark of The Cavernous Sinus|first1=I.

The '''Philosophy of Science Association''' ('''PSA''') is an American academic organization which promotes the study and discussion of the [[philosophy of science]].

Founded in 1933, the PSA engages in activities such as the publishing of periodicals, essays and [[monograph]]s in the field of the philosophy of science; sponsoring conventions and meetings; and the awarding of prizes for distinguished work in the field. In 2012, it began presenting the '''Hempel Award''', named for the eminent 20th-century philosopher of science [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], for lifetime achievement in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsci.org/2-uncategorised/221-hempel-award-recipients Hempel Award recipients]&lt;/ref&gt; The first recipient was [[Bas van Fraassen]].

The President during 2015/2016 is [[C. Kenneth Waters]].

He was formerly Forbes Professor of Architecture at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1992–95), Professor of Architecture and Head of the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering at the [[University of Bath]] (1995–2005), LSE Professor of Architecture and Urban Design (2005–2011) and Director of the [[LSE Cities]] Programme (2005–08). He held various visiting academic posts internationally, including Visiting Professor at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA, 1998), European Union Visiting Scholar in planning and conservation at the [[University of Texas A&amp;M]] (2002); and Visiting Professor in Architecture and Urbanism at the University of São Paulo, Brazil (2004), and the University of Bath (since 2009).

He founded the Centre for Advanced Studies in Architecture (CASA) at Bath, and with [[Vaughan Hart]], established a focus on Classical and Italian Renaissance architectural treatises; between them they have translated and written about the leading classical architectural theorists – including, [[Vitruvius]], [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]], [[Sebastiano Serlio|Serlio]] and [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]]. He has been a national assessor for the Architecture and the Built Environment sub-panel of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE2008) for the UK Higher Education Funding Council for Education (HEFCE), and a member of the Faculty of the Fine Arts of the British School at Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsr.ac.uk/about/governance |title=Governance « The British School at Rome |publisher=Bsr.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tavernor initiated (with co-authors) a series of modern translations of the principal classical architectural treatise writers – Vitruvius, Alberti and Palladio – and is the sole author of parallel monographs on these subjects published by (Yale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/YupBooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300124927 |title=Smoot's Ear - Tavernor, Robert - Yale University Press |work=Yalepress.yale.edu |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2013-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103083921/http://yalepress.yale.edu/YupBooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300124927 |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and MIT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/authors/robert-tavernor |title=Robert Tavernor &amp;#124; The MIT Press |publisher=Mitpress.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book on Alberti was described as "the last and the best of the books on Alberti on this scale in the twentieth century" (Chronique).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300076158 |title=On Alberti and the Art of Building |work=Yalepress.yale.edu |date=1999-01-11 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pioneered the use of the computer to visualise urban forms in architectural exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1578928 |title=Cambridge Journals Online - arq: Architectural Research Quarterly - Abstract - Architectural history and computing |work=Journals.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-curating with Rykwert in 1994 the international exhibition of Alberti's work at [[Palazzo Te]] in [[Mantua]] for the computer firm [[Olivetti]]. As a consultant architect and urbanist he applies his knowledge of architectural history, design and the visual representation of buildings in advising planners and architects on the form, character, scale and massing of tall buildings in the [[City of London]] and along the south bank of the [[Thames]]. His advice on several large urban masterplan projects in London (including Battersea Power Station) led to him being invited in 2007, by former Russian Senator Gordeev, to assemble and to contribute his expertise to an international masterplanning team to re-configure the city of [[Perm]] (population of 1 million) in the southern [[Urals]]. The published masterplan led by KCAP was awarded the Grand Prix at the Moscow Architecture Biennale in May 2010.

== Works ==

As an architectural historian and theorist, he is an expert in the foundations of [[Italian Renaissance architecture]] and the transmission of associated ideas and forms to England and America. He is the author of ''Palladio and Palladianism'' (1991 – subsequently translated into Italian, Chinese and Korean) and ''On Alberti and the Art of Building'' (1998). He is co-translator of two English translations of architectural treatises: Leon Battista Alberti’s 16th century ''De re aedificatoria'', as ''On the Art of Building in Ten Books'' (1988); and Andrea Palladio’s 17th century ''I quattro libri dell’architettura'', as ''The Four Books on Architecture'' (1997), and co-edited and provided the introduction to Vitruvius' ''On Architecture'' (2009).

Tavernor's translation works have become the standard texts in art historical scholarship, used by students and scholars throughout the world. His book ''Smoot’s Ear: The Measure of Humanity'' (2007 and 2008) pulls together much of his earlier writings and sets measures and measuring in a cultural context and shows how deeply they are connected to human experience and history.

He was co-editor of ''Body and Building: Essays on the changing relation of Body to Architecture'' (2002 and 2005), a collection of essays on art and architecture dedicated to Rykwert. He founded the Alberti Group with Rykwert, which led to the 1994 international exhibition on Alberti for Olivetti. [[Photogrammetry|Photogrammetric drawings]] relating to research for the exhibition can be found on the CASA website at Bath University. Tavernor was subsequently commissioned by the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] to produce computer animated urban and architectural reconstructions through CASA for exhibitions in London and internationally, for the Sir John Soane Exhibition (1999), Aztecs Exhibition (2003), and by [[Tate Britain]] for the Sir [[Stanley Spencer]] Exhibition (2001).&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-7769421"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/stanley-spencer-virtual-church-house |title=Stanley Spencer - Virtual Church-House |work=tate.org.uk |date=October 27, 2009 |accessdate=May 19, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520044649/http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/stanley-spencer-virtual-church-house |archivedate=20 May 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Tavernor is currently an architectural and urban design consultant in London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8603">A '''runoff footprint''' is the total [[surface runoff]] that a site produces over the course of a year. According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), stormwater is "rainwater and melted snow that runs off streets, lawns, and other sites." &lt;ref&gt;EPA Stormwater Management http://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/stormwater/&lt;/ref&gt; Urbanized areas with high concentrations of [[impervious surface]]s like buildings, roads, and driveways produce large volumes of runoff which can lead to flooding, sewer overflows, and poor [[water quality]]. Since soil in urban areas can be compacted and have a low [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration rate]], the surface runoff estimated in a runoff footprint is not just from impervious surfaces, but also pervious areas including yards. The total runoff is a measure of the site’s contribution to stormwater issues in an area, especially in urban areas with sewer overflows. Completing a runoff footprint for a site allows a property owner to understand what areas on his or her site are producing the most runoff and what scenarios of stormwater green solutions like [[Rainwater tank|rain barrels]] and [[rain gardens]] are most effective in mitigating this runoff and its costs to the community.

== Significance ==

The runoff footprint is the stormwater equivalent to the carbon/energy footprint. When homeowners or business owners complete an energy audit or carbon footprint, they understand how they are consuming energy and learn how this consumption can be reduced through [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]] measures. Correspondingly, the runoff footprint allows someone to calculate their baseline annual runoff and assess what the impact of ideal stormwater green solutions would be for their site. Since the passage of the [[Clean Water Act]] in 1972, the EPA has monitored and regulated stormwater issues in urban areas. Municipalities across the United States are now required to upgrade sanitary and stormwater systems to meet EPA mandates. The total cost for these upgrades across the United States exceeds $3000 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/epa_us_needs_300_billion_in_se.html Syracuse.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Municipalities across the United States need $300 billion in sewer, water upgrades http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/epa_us_needs_300_billion_in_se.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The stormwater runoff from every property in an area can contribute to the overall stormwater issues including overflows and water pollution. Stormwater runoff carries nonpoint source pollution which is a leading cause of water quality issues.&lt;ref&gt;EPA - What is Nonpoint Source Pollution? http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/whatis.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

By completing a runoff footprint, homeowners and business owners can consider how stormwater green solutions can reduce runoff on-site. Stormwater green solutions (also called green infrastructure) use "vegetation, soils, and natural processes to manage water and create healthier urban environments.  At the scale of a city or county, green infrastructure refers to the patchwork of natural areas that provides habitat, flood protection, cleaner air, and cleaner water. At the scale of a neighborhood or site, green infrastructure refers to stormwater management systems that mimic nature by soaking up and storing water".&lt;ref&gt;What is Green Infrastructure? http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/greeninfrastructure/gi_what.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Stormwater green solutions include bioswales (directional rain gardens), cisterns, green roofs, permeable pavement, rain barrels, and rain gardens. According to the EPA, onsite stormwater green solutions or [[Low-impact development (UK)|low-impact development]]s (LIDs) can significantly reduce runoff and costly stormwater/sewer infrastructure upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;EPA - Reducing Stormwater Costs http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/green/costs07_index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Stormwater green solutions can also reduce energy consumption. Treating and pumping water is an energy-intensive activity. According to the River Network, the U.S. consumes at least 521 million MWh a year for water-related purposes which is the equivalent to 13% of the nation’s electricity consumption &lt;ref&gt;River Network. The Carbon Footprint of Water. http://www.rivernetwork.org/resource-library/carbon-footprint-water&lt;/ref&gt; Potable water must be treated and then pumped to the consumer. Wastewater is treated before being discharged. In areas with combined sewer systems or old separate sewer systems with high [[Infiltration/Inflow|inflow and infiltration]], stormwater is also treated at the wastewater treatment facilities. By capturing stormwater runoff onsite in rain barrels and cisterns, the consumption of potable water for irrigation and its corresponding energy impact can be reduced. The reduction of runoff from all types of stormwater green solutions reduces the stormwater that may end up at the wastewater treatment facility in areas with combined sewer systems or old separate sewers.

== Completing a Runoff Footprint ==

There are number of methods available to complete a Runoff Footprint. The simplest methods involve using a runoff coefficient, which according to the State Water Resources Control Board of California is "a dimensionless coefficient relating the amount of runoff to the amount of precipitation received. It is a larger value for areas with low infiltration and high runoff (pavement, steep gradient), and lower for permeable, well vegetated areas (forest, flat land)."&lt;ref&gt;Runoff Coefficient (C) Fact Sheet http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/docs/cwt/guidance/513.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The runoff coefficients for different surface types on a site can be multiplied with the area for each surface along with the annual precipitation to generate a rough runoff footprint. If the runoff coefficient and areas of proposed stormwater green solutions like rain gardens and bioswales for the site are known, the reduction in overall runoff from these improvements can be estimated.

More accurate Runoff Footprint tools exist. By using computer modeling and detailed weather data, complex runoff footprints can be made easy. The amounts of pollution in the stormwater runoff can be estimated, and the effects of combinations of stormwater green solutions can be assessed. The James River Association of central Virginia provides an [http://www.jamesriverassociation.org/get-involved/runoff-calculator/ online tool] where property owners in the James River watershed can generate a site-specific runoff pollution report.&lt;ref&gt;JRA - Do you know What’s in Your Runoff? http://www.jamesriverassociation.org/get-involved/runoff-calculator/&lt;/ref&gt; MyRunoff.org provides an online [http://www.myrunoff.org runoff footprint calculator] for property owners across the United States to estimate their baseline runoff and the reduction from different scenarios of rain barrels and rain gardens.&lt;ref&gt;MyRunoff.org's Runoff Footprint Calculator. http://myrunoff.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA launched the National Stormwater Calculator in July, 2013, which is a desktop application for Windows allowing users to model the annual impact of a range of stormwater green solutions.&lt;ref&gt;National Stormwater Calculator http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/wq/models/swc/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sarajevo Music Academy''' or '''Music Academy | University of Sarajevo'''({{lang-bs|Muzička Akademija Univerziteta u Sarajevu}} or '''MAS''') is a [[Faculty of Music]] of [[University of Sarajevo]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unsa.ba/en/org-jedinica/music-academy&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Sarajevo Music  Academy  was founded by the Decision of the National Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina on May 20, 1955 as the fourth such higher education institution in the former joint state, and the first established after the  [[World War II]]. This Decision was published in the official Gazette of the [[People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] No. 12/55, on June 8, 1955. The establishment of the Sarajevo Music  Academy preceded a number of favorable prerequisites, such as the establishment of a network of music schools, the founding of the [[Sarajevo National Theater]], Sarajevo Opera House, Symphony Orchestra RTV Sarajevo, the Institute for the study of folklore and the continuity of the [[Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra]].
At the founding of the Academy, the founders of this institution were:
*Milenko Živković, rector of the Academy of Music in Belgrade
*Dr. [[Dragotin Cvetko]], professor of the [[Academy of Music (Ljubljana)]]
*[[Natko Devčić]], professor at the [[Academy of Music, University of Zagreb]]
*Cvjetko Rihtman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proleksis.lzmk.hr/43975/|title=Rihtman, Cvjetko - Proleksis enciklopedija|website=proleksis.lzmk.hr|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; director of the Folklore Research Institute in Sarajevo
*Miroslav Špiler,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=59839|title=Špiler, Miroslav - Hrvatska enciklopedija|website=www.enciklopedija.hr|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; professor of the Higher Pedagogical Academy in Sarajevo
*Strahinja Dramušić, in front of the Council for Education, Science and Culture of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a scorer
After the formation of the first pedagogical core at the Sarajevo Music Academy the first Rector was elected, prof. Cvetko Rihtman. In the first year of the Academy's work, 42 students were enrolled. Teaching at the Sarajevo Music Academy began on 19 December 1955 in seven sections:

*I   -  Department of Composition and Conducting
*II  -  Department of solo singing
*III -  Department of Piano 
*IV  -  Department of string Instruments
*V   -  Department of wind instruments
*VI  -  Department of Musicology
*VII -  Theoretical-pedagogical section

The fateful and tragic events that affected the former joint state in the nineties, made the Academy without a large number of teachers and associates, and the building was badly damaged on six occasions. One of the "holes" in the wall between the concert hall and the hallway, was inscribed and preserved the Academy's management, as a symbol of these difficult times. A large number of students left Sarajevo. Out of 45 permanently hired teachers and assistants at the Academy, only fifteen remained. The Academy has lost two-thirds of the collective. The only staff were teachers from other institutions that had been hired from time to time, and the number of students was about 50. Difficulties were  also reflected in the organization of the teaching itself and in the absence of a functional work space.
In spite of all that, the training was interrupted only once for a short time, in May 1995, due to a more intensive bombing. Teachers of the instrumental sections often held classes in their own apartments due to the unsuccessful working space, but also the safety. Regardless of the difficult circumstances of life and work, the rest of the Academy has preserved human and professional enthusiasm. Apart from the efforts to preserve the teaching process, the Academy's teachers played a major role in establishing the Orchestra of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, restarting the work of the Sarajevo Philharmonic, and the academic choir "Gaudeamus". Thanks to efforts from then dean, Osman-Faruk Sijarić&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/movies/stunned-by-war-the-arts-of-sarajevo-are-reawakening.html&lt;/ref&gt;, significant support and assistance from music academies and conservatories from Vienna, Bern, Graz, Karlsruhe, Madrid, Stockholm, was given and the Sarajevo Music Academy was registered unanonimuosly in the membership of the European Association of Music Conservatories and Academies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec-music.eu/members/our-members|title=Our Members|website=AEC|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[European Association of Conservatoires]]). In the war period, 15 students graduated ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]), 2 graduated ([[Master of Arts|MA]]) and one doctorate ([[PhD]]) was defended at the Academy. With huge difficulty, the Academy accomplished its basic function for almost the last decade of the 20th century.

In more than 62 years of existence and work of the Academy, there graduated over 2500 students, mastered them around 200, and about 24 doctorates were defended. About 300 teachers and associates were taking care about everything. Regardless of the great political, social and any other turbulence that strongly influenced all aspects of existence and work, the Academy had an upward developmental line. Today it is an internationally recognizable artistic and educational institution with developed departments, academic degrees, expressed artistic and scientific activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.unsa.ba/historijat|title=Historijat - Muzička Akademija Univerziteta u Sarajevu|website=www.mas.unsa.ba|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spongiosum''' is the Latin adjective for "spongy".  The term is used in [[anatomy]] for tissues that become filled with blood:  ''[[corpus spongiosum]]'', ''stratum spongiosum'' of the [[decidua]].  It is also used in [[binomial nomenclature]] of organisms, such as the seaweed ''[[Codium]] spongiosum''.

[[File:Adriaen van Ostade 006.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Adriaen van Ostade]]. ''Selfportrait.'' 1663. [[Gemäldegalerie]].]]

A '''studio''' is an [[artist]] or worker's workroom. This can be for the purpose of [[acting]], [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[pottery]] ([[ceramic]]s), [[sculpture]], [[origami]], [[woodworking]], [[scrapbooking]], [[photography]], [[graphic design]], [[filmmaking]], [[animation]], [[industrial design]], [[radio]] or [[television production]] [[broadcasting]] or the making of [[music]]. The term is also used for the workroom of [[dancer]]s, often specified to [[dance studio]].

The word ''studio'' is derived from the {{Lang-it|studio}}, from {{Lang-lat|studium}}, from ''studere'', meaning to [[Wiktionary:study|study]] or zeal.

The French term for studio, '''[[atelier]]''', in addition to designating an artist's studio is used to characterize the studio of a fashion designer. Atelier also has the connotation of being the home of an [[alchemy|alchemist]] or [[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]].

''Studio'' is also a metonym for the group of people who work within a particular studio. 

==Art studio==
[[File:Jane Frank Portrait .jpg|thumb|Artist [[Jane Frank]] in her studio, 1960s or 1970s. The studio of a contemporary [[mixed media]] artist can be quite a messy affair.]]

The studio of any artist, especially from the 15th to the 19th centuries, characterized all the assistants, thus the designation of paintings as "from the [[workshop]] of..." or "studio of..."
An art studio is sometimes called an '''atelier''', especially in earlier eras. In contemporary, English language use, "atelier" can also refer to the [[Atelier Method]], a training method for artists that usually takes place in a professional artist's studio. 

The above-mentioned "method" calls upon that zeal for study to play a significant role in the production which occurs in a studio space. A studio is more or less artful to the degree that the artist who occupies it is committed to the continuing education in his or her formal discipline. Academic curricula categorize studio classes in order to prepare students for the rigors of building sets of skills which require a continuity of practice in order to achieve growth and mastery of their artistic expression. A versatile and creative mind will embrace the opportunity of such practice to innovate and experiment, which develops uniquely individual qualities of each artist's expression. Thus the method raises and maintains an art studio space above the level of a mere production facility or workshop.

Safety is or may be a concern in studios, with some painting materials required to be handled, stored, or used properly to prevent poisoning, chemical burns, or fire.&lt;ref&gt;Friel, Michael (2010). ''Still Life Painting Atelier: An Introduction to Oil Painting'', p.20. {{ISBN|978-0-8230-3408-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Commons-inline|bullet=none|Category:Ateliers|atelier}}

==Educational studio==
In educational studios, students learn to develop skills related to design, ranging from architecture to product design.  In specific, educational studios are studio settings where large numbers of students learn to draft and design with instructional help at a college.  Educational studios are colloquially referred to as "studio" by students, who are known for staying up late hours into the night doing projects and socializing.

The studio environment is characterized by 2 types in education:
# The workspace where students do usually visually-centered work in an open environment. This time and space is beyond that of instructional time and faculty guidance is not available. It allows for students to engage each other, help each other, and inspire each other while working.
# A type of class that takes the above-mentioned workshop space, and recreates its core component of an open working environment. It differentiates itself based on a topic of instruction, isolated space, instructor led/included, and an added focus of directed criticism. A great take on this latter type of "studio classroom" is [http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/studio/what.html described by Carleton University].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is studio teaching?|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/studio/what.html|accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pottery studio==
[[Pottery|Studio pottery]] is made by an individual potter working on his own in his studio, rather than in a ceramics factory (although there may be a design studio within a larger manufacturing site).

==Production studios==
Production studios are those studios which act as centres for the production in any of the [[arts]]; alternatively they can also be the financial and commercial entity behind such endeavours. In radio and [[television production]] studio is the place where programs and [[radio commercial]] and [[television advertising]] are recorded for further emission.

===Animation studio===
[[Animation studio]]s, like [[movie studio]]s, may be production facilities, or financial entities. In some cases, especially in [[anime]], they continue the tradition of a studio where a [[Master tradesman|master]] or group of talented individuals oversee the work of lesser artists and crafts persons in realising their vision. Animation studios are a fast rising entity and they include established firms such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]] and [[Pixar]].

===Comics studio===
Artists or writers, predominantly those producing [[comics]], still employ small studios of staff to assist in the creation of a [[comic strip]], [[comic book]] or [[graphic novel]].  In the early days of [[Dan Dare]], [[Frank Hampson]] employed a number of staff at his studio to help with the production of the strip.  [[Eddie Campbell]] is another creator who has assembled a small studio of colleagues to help him in his art, and the comic book industry of the United States has based its production methods upon the studio system employed at its beginnings.

==Instructional studio==
[[File:Student using Laptop.jpg|thumbnail|right|Student using a laptop in an instructional studio.]]
Many [[University|universities]] are creating studio settings for courses outside the artist's realm. There are several different projects along these lines, most notably the [[SCALE-UP]] (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs) initiated at [[NC State]].

===Mastering studio===
In audio, a mastering studio is a facility specialised in [[audio mastering]]. Tasks may include but not be limited to audio restoration, corrective and tone-shaping EQ, dynamic control, stereo or 5.1 surround editing, vinyl and tape transfers, vinyl cutting, and CD compilation. Depending on the quality of the original mix, the mastering engineer's role can change from small corrections to improving the overall sound of a mix drastically. Typically studios contain a combination of high-end analogue equipment with low-noise circuitry and digital hardware and plug-ins. Some may contain tape machines and vinyl lathes. They may also contain full-range monitoring systems and be acoustically tuned to provide an accurate reproduction of the sound information contained in the original medium. The mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination, which may be radio, CD, vinyl or digital distribution.

In [[video production]], a mastering studio is a facility specialized in the [[post-production]] of video recordings. Tasks may include but not be limited to: [[video editing]], [[colour grading]] correction, mixing, [[DVD authoring]] and [[audio mastering]]. The mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination, which may be broadcast, DVD or digital distribution.

===Acting studio===

An "acting studio" is an institution or workspace (similar to a dance studio) in which actors rehearse and refine their craft. The [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] and [[Actors Studio]] are legendary acting studios in New York.

===Movie studio===
{{Main|Movie studio}}

A '''movie studio''' is a [[company (law)|company]] which develops, equips and maintains a controlled environment for [[filmmaking]].  This environment may be interior ([[sound stage]]), exterior ([[backlot]]) or both.

===Photographic studio===
{{Main|Photographic studio}}

A photographic studio is both a workspace and a [[corporation|corporate]] body. As a workspace it provides space to take, develop, print and duplicate photographs.

===Radio studio===
{{Main|Radio studio}}

A radio studio is a room in which a [[Radio programming|radio program]] or show is produced, either for live [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] or for recording for a later broadcast.  The room is soundproofed to avoid unwanted noise being mixed into the broadcast.

===Recording studio===
{{Main|Recording studio}}

A recording studio is a facility for [[sound recording]] which generally consists of at least two rooms: the studio or live room, and the control room, where the sound from the studio is recorded and manipulated. They are designed so that they have good [[acoustics]] and so that there is good isolation between the rooms.

===Television studio===
{{Main|Television studio}}

A television studio is an installation in which television or [[video production]]s take place, for [[live television]], for recording [[video tape]], or for the acquisition of raw [[footage]] for [[post-production]]. The design of a studio is similar to, and derived from, [[movie studio]]s, with a few amendments for the special requirements of television production. A professional television studio generally has several rooms, which are kept separate for noise and practicality reasons.

==Yoga and martial arts studios==
Many of the healing arts and activities such as yoga, judo, karate are "studied" in a studio.  It is very common to see yoga studios and martial arts studios established in settings that might previously have been for other uses, described as studios.  These are not really recreation centers, or gyms in the traditional sense, but places where students of these activities practice or study their art.

'''The Fable of Oscar''' is a fable proposed by [[John L. Pollock]] in his book ''How to Build a Person'' ({{ISBN|9780262161138}}) to defend the idea of token physicalism, agent materialism, and strong AI. It ultimately illustrates what is needed for an [[Artificial Intelligence]] to be built and why humans are just like intelligent machines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/How_to_Build_a_Person.html?id=WIRkVRTM6bYC|title=How to Build a Person: A Prolegomenon|last=Pollock|first=John L.|date=1989-01-01|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262161138|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC left}}

==Fable==
Once in a distant land there lived a race of Engineers. They have all their physical needs provided by the machines they have invented. One of the Engineers decide that he will create an "intelligent machine" that is much more ingenious than the more machines, in that it can actually sense, learn, and adapt to its environment as an intelligent animal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Oscar I===

The first version of the machine is called "Oscar I". It has pain sensors and "[[Fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight]]" responses build within to help it survive hostile environment. In this stage Oscar I is much like the machines [[Hilary Putnam]] considers in 1960.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Oscar II ===

In order for Oscar I to avoid damages in hostile environment, it must not only be able to respond to its pain sensors but also predict what is likely to happen based on its generalization of its pain sensor activations. Therefore, a "pain sensor sensor" was built to sense its pain sensors, thus giving it a rudimentary self-awareness. In this stage Oscar I is much like an amoeba as Oscar II like a worm. Amoebas respond to pain while worms learn to avoid it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Oscar III===

The problem with Oscar II is that it has no conception if the environment is fooling him. For example, he can't distinguish if a machine-eating tiger and a mirror image of such tiger. To solve such problem,  "introspective sensors" were built into Oscar II and made him "Oscar III". Oscar III can now sense the operation of its own sensors and form generalization about its reliability, thus acquired a higher degree of self-awareness. In this stage Oscar II is much like a bird as Oscar III a kitten. Kittens quickly learn about mirror image and come to ignore them while birds go on attacking their own reflection until they become exhausted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Mind/Body Problem===

Consider a world populated by Oscarites. If the Oscarites are sufficiently intelligent, it can philosophizing the difference between their outward physical state and inward mental state. While we, from our perspective, describe the Oscarites as sensing the operation of their perceptual sensors, they describe it as they are "being self-aware and being conscious".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Conclusion===

In the end of the fable Pollock states that while the Engineers are fictional, Oscar is real and we are in fact the Oscarites.

'''''The Inner Circle''''' is a novel by [[T. C. Boyle]] first published in 2004 about the development of [[sexology]] in the United States and about [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s rise to fame during the late 1940s and early 1950s as seen through the eyes of one of his loyal assistants.

This assistant, however, John Milk, is a fictional character rather than a historical person. Boyle makes it unmistakably clear in the "Author’s Note" that ''The Inner Circle'' "is a work of fiction, and [that] all characters and situations have been invented, with the exception of the historical figures of Alfred C. Kinsey and his wife, Clara Bracken (McMillen) Kinsey".

==Plot introduction==
''The Inner Circle'' revolves around the tensions that are bound to arise if a small group of people deliberately abandons the traditional moral values with which they were raised in favour of an unconventional outlook on love, marriage and sex. While Kinsey preaches that sex is nothing but a "[[hormone|hormonal]] function" devoid of [[emotion]], John Milk has extreme difficulty adjusting to this concept where his own wife — the young and beautiful Iris — is concerned.

==Plot summary==

Milk's sexual [[coming of age]] starts in 1939 when he is a student at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] and attends Kinsey’s “marriage course”, a [[lecture]] in which the renowned zoologist propounds his theories and his plans for the first time in front of a large audience. Still a [[virginity|virgin]], he makes Kinsey’s acquaintance when the latter interviews him in order to take his “sex history”. Kinsey makes Milk his personal assistant despite his inexperience, but he turns out to be a quick learner, and thus the young man becomes the first member of what will be “the inner circle”: a handful of men (and, up to a point, also their wives) who furiously collaborate under Kinsey’s dictatorial rule towards the publication of the two volumes later referred to as the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey Report]].

==Characters in ''The Inner Circle''==
*[[Alfred Kinsey]] – Professor conducting studies of sex at college Milk attends
*Clara Bracken Kinsey – Alfred's wife
*John Milk – Kinsey's assistant and protagonist
*Iris Milk – John's wife

==Literary significance and criticism==
While the novel garnered generally favorable reviews, some reviewers and readers consider ''The Inner Circle'' to be one of Boyle’s lesser novels. The criticisms generally cite slow-moving and somewhat predictable plotting, as well as an overly-linear storyline.

The German translation of the novel bears the more lurid title '''''Dr. Sex'''''.

'''''The Worship of the Serpent''''' by [[John Bathurst Deane]] is an 1833 study of [[snake worship]] and specifically the snake mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]] who convinced [[Eve]] to eat the fruit of the [[Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil]], leading her to convince [[Adam]] to do the same.

==Overview==
A number of [[Gnostic]] texts, some only discovered recently such as those from the [[Nag Hammadi Library]] expound on an idea of knowledge and how the serpent gave knowledge to man. Deane draws a number of conclusions and makes certain guesses regarding snake worship, not just confined to Europe, but indeed all over the world. Deane goes on in his title to list a number of associations to the serpent such as the [[dragon]] and the [[leviathan]]. So thorough (albeit outdated) is his research, that he has "traced THE WORSHIP OF THE SERPENT from Babylonia, east and west, through Persia, Hindûstan, China, Mexico, Britain, Scandinavia, Italy, Illyricum, Thrace, Greece, Asia Minor, and Phœnicia." (Ch VIII)&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd,''The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World'' (2006), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

He was well known throughout the architecture community for his role in the development of [[Postmodern architecture|Contextualism]], along with [[Colin Rowe]], under whom he studied at Cornell; and for his expertise in rationalist Italian architecture.  Schumacher is ranked in the 90th percentile for research in architecture in a survey of over 3,000 architecture professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://papers.archsoc.com/Ratingprofs2010.pdf |title=Rating the Architecture Professors in Research: 2010 Report |publisher=Key Centre for Architectural Sociology |accessdate=September 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913020445/http://papers.archsoc.com/Ratingprofs2010.pdf |archivedate=September 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a registered architect and a member of the [[Society of Architectural Historians]].

==Life, education and career==
Thomas L. Schumacher was born on November 7, 1941, in New York City, and grew up in the Bronx, where he attended the now defunct [[William Howard Taft High School (New York City)|Wm. Howard Taft High School]], graduating in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taftreunion1958.myevent.com/3/custom_form.htm |title=Gone Too Soon II |accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schumacher Attended [[Cornell University]] where he earned a Bachelor of Architecture in 1963 and a Master of Architecture in 1966.  His M.Arch thesis, "South Amboy new town; an exercise in urban form", was directed by Colin Rowe and was influential in the development of the contextualism school of thought.  Schumacher was awarded the Rome Prize for architecture in 1967, studying at the American Academy in Rome until 1969.  In 1977, he became a registered architect in the state of New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newjersey.mylicense.com/verification/Details.aspx?agency_id=1&amp;license_id=44583&amp; |title=State of New Jersey Department of Consumer Affairs License Search |publisher=newjersey.mylicense.com |accessdate=September 12, 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2026">A '''thyristor drive''' is a motor drive circuit where [[alternating current|AC]] supply current is regulated by a [[thyristor]] [[phase (waves)|phase]] control to provide variable [[voltage]] to a [[DC motor]].

==Applications==
Thyristor drives are very simple and were first introduced in the 1960s. They remained the predominant type of industrial [[motor controller]] until the end of the 1980s when the availability of low cost electronics led to their replacement by [[Chopper (electronics)|chopper drives]] for high performance systems and [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]] for high reliability with [[AC motor]]s. They are still employed in very high power applications, such as [[locomotive]]s, where the high power capability of the thyristors and the simplicity of the design can make them a more attractive proposition than transistor based controllers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/48678403/INDUSTRIAL-ELECTRONICS-NOTES-PART-2|title=INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS NOTES (PART 2) {{!}} Rectifier {{!}} Semiconductor Devices|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hyclassproject.com/design-and-construction-of-a-thyristor-speed-control-of-a-dc-motor.html|title=design and construction of a thyristor speed control of a dc motor- for B.Sc, HND, and OND  project topics and material {{!}} www.hyclassproject.com|website=www.hyclassproject.com|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A derivative of the thyristor drive is the simple [[AC phase controller]]. This uses a single phase controlled [[TRIAC|triac]] to provide a variable voltage AC output for regulating a [[universal motor]]. This is the type of motor speed control most commonly used in domestic appliances, such as food mixers, and small AC powered tools, such as electric drills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{wiktionary|Vaticanology|Vanticanologist|Vaticanist}}
'''Vaticanologist''' or '''Vaticanist''' is a term coined in the mid-to-late twentieth century to describe journalists, academics, and commentators whose area of expertise is in studying and understanding the manner by which the [[Holy See]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] operate. Particular emphasis is placed on the selection and appointment mechanisms by which the Church's leadership emerges. '''Vaticanology''' is the field in which Vaticanists and Vaticanologists function.

==Origin and history==
It owes its origins to the term [[Kremlinologist]], which was used to describe media, academic and commentary experts who followed the function of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in general and the functioning and selection of the leadership elite in particular.

Both the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Kremlin]] and the Holy See operated in a great degree of secrecy and mystery, hence the attention paid to "experts" who were presumed to be able to read subtle nuances indicating who was on the "way up", who was on the "way down" and who were the "ones to watch" within their leadership elites.

Famous ''Vaticanologist'' include the author and commentator [[Peter Hebblethwaite]], who wrote biographies of (among others) [[Pope John XXIII]] and [[Pope Paul VI]], as well as a best-selling account of the events of 1978 in ''[[Year of Three Popes]]''. [[Robert Blair Kaiser]] was a noted contributor in the field, who did much reporting on the [[Second Vatican Council]] for ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''.

In 2005, with the first [[papal election]] in the age of the continuous news cycle and the internet, many ''Vaticanologists'' became prominent through their wide dissemination both on television and in online publications. [[Blog]]s have become a popular means for amateur [[Vatican watcher]]s to "share" their "thoughts" and "insights".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4834">The '''Washington Accord''' is an international accreditation agreement for professional [[engineering]] [[academic degree]]s between the bodies responsible for accreditation in its signatory countries. Established in 1989, the full signatories as of 2018 are [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Taiwan]], [[Pakistan]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Russia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Philippines]], [[Peru]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Signatories&gt;{{cite web| title=Washington Accord| url=http://www.ieagreements.org/accords/washington/signatories/| publisher=International Engineering Alliance|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement recognizes that there is substantial equivalence of programs accredited by those signatories. Graduates of accredited programs in any of the signatory countries are recognized by the other signatory countries as having met the academic requirements for entry to the practice of engineering. Recognition of accredited programs is not retroactive but takes effect only from the date of admission of the country to signatory status.

==Scope==
The Washington Accord covers undergraduate engineering degrees under [[Outcome-based education]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.utar.edu.my/fes/file/OBE.pdf| title=Outcome Based Education| date=18 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Engineering technology]] and [[postgraduate]] engineering programs are not covered by the accord. Engineering technology programs are covered under the [[Sydney Accord]] and [[Dublin Accord]]. Only qualifications awarded after the signatory country or region became part of the Washington Accord are recognized. The accord is not directly responsible for the licensing  of [[Professional Engineer]]s and the registration of [[Chartered Engineer]]s, but it does cover the academic requirements that are part of the licensing processes in signatory countries.

Historically and presently, in many parts of the world, women's participation in the profession of medicine (as [[physician]]s or [[surgeons]] for instance) has been significantly restricted. However, women's informal practice of medicine in roles such as caregivers or as [[allied health professions|allied health professionals]] has been widespread. Most countries of the world now provide women with equal access to [[medical education]]. However, not all countries ensure equal employment opportunities,&lt;ref&gt;See generally, "Women's Human Rights", 1998, [[Human Rights Watch]] (available [https://www.hrw.org/worldreport99/women/women3.html online]).&lt;/ref&gt; and gender equality has yet to be achieved within medical [[Specialty (medicine)|specialties]] and around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reichenbach|first=Laura|last2=Brown|first2=Hilary|date=2004-10-02|title=Gender and academic medicine: impacts on the health workforce|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=329|issue=7469|pages=792–795|issn=0959-8138|pmid=15459056|doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7469.792|pmc=521007}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite studies suggesting that female doctors may be providing higher-quality care than male doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsugawa|first=Yusuke|last2=Jena|first2=Anupam B.|last3=Figueroa|first3=Jose F.|last4=Orav|first4=E.

They continued to practice without formal training or recognition in England and eventually North America for the next several centuries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The History of Women in Surgery, by Debrah A. Wirtzfeld, MD&lt;/ref&gt;  Women's participation in the medical professions was generally limited by legal and social practices during the decades while medicine was [[professionalization|professionalizing]].&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich-English-1973-Witches"&gt;See generally [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] &amp; [[Deirdre English]], ''Witches, Midwives, and Nurses'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; However, women openly practiced medicine in the [[allied health professions]] ([[nursing]], [[midwifery]], etc.), and throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, women made significant gains in access to [[medical education]] and medical work through much of the world. These gains were sometimes tempered by setbacks; for instance, [[Mary Roth Walsh]] documented a ''decline'' in women physicians in the US in the first half of the twentieth century, such that there were fewer women physicians in 1950 than there were in 1900.&lt;ref name="Walsh-1977"&gt;Walsh, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, through the latter half of the twentieth century, women made gains generally across the board. In the United States, for instance, women were 9% of total US medical school enrollment in 1969; this had increased to 20% in 1976.&lt;ref name="Walsh-1977" /&gt;  By 1985, women constituted 16% of practicing US physicians.&lt;ref name="Morantz-Sanchez-2001-preface"&gt;Morantz-Sanchez, Preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the twenty-first century in industrialized nations, women have made significant gains, but have yet to achieve parity throughout the medical profession.  Women have achieved parity in medical school in some industrialized countries, since 2003 forming the majority of the United States medical student body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamc.org/newsroom/pressrel/2003/031104.htm "Applicants to U.S. Medical Schools Increase; Women the Majority for the First Time"],  [[Association of American Medical Colleges]], Nov. 3, 2003, press release ("Women made up the majority of medical school applicants for the first time ever").&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007-2008, women accounted for 49% of medical school applicants and 48.3% of those accepted.&lt;ref name="aamc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aamc.org/download/153708/data/ |format=PDF |title=U.S. Medical School Applicants and Students 1982-1983 to 2011-2012 |work=aamc.org |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;!--dead link: http://www.aamc.org/data/facts/charts1982to2007.pdf --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) 48.3% (16,838) of medical degrees awarded in the US in 2009-10 were earned by women, an increase from 26.8% in 1982-3.&lt;ref name="aamc" /&gt; While more women are taking part in the medical field, a 2013-2014 study reported that there are significantly fewer women in leadership positions within the academic realm of medicine. This study found that women accounted for 16% of deans, 21% of the professors, and 38% of faculty, as compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Rebecca M. "Gender Inequality in Medicine: Too Much Evidence to Ignore." Psychiatric Times, vol. 34, no. 5, September 2017, pp. 1–5., http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/blogs/early-career-psychiatry/gender-inequality-medicine-too-much-evidence-ignore&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the practice of medicine remains disproportionately male overall. In industrialized nations, the recent parity in gender of medical students has not yet trickled into parity in practice. In many developing nations, neither medical school nor practice approach gender parity.

Moreover, there are skews within the medical profession: some medical specialties, such as surgery, are significantly male-dominated,&lt;ref&gt;Dixie Mills, "Women in Surgery - Past, Present, and Future" (2003 presentation), [[Association of Women Surgeons]]; available at [http://www.womensurgeons.org/about/items/womeninsurgery2003c.ppt AWS website].&lt;/ref&gt; while other specialties are significantly female-dominated, or are becoming so. In the United States, female physicians outnumber male physicians in pediatrics and female residents outnumber male residents in family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, and psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/16229.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102101755/http://www.ama-assn.org:80/ama/pub/category/16229.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 November 2007 |title=AMA (WPC) Table 16 - Physician Specialties by Gender- 2006 |date=25 September 2015 |work=Women Physicians Congress (WPC) |accessdate=10 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/12915.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022162222/http://www.ama-assn.org:80/ama/pub/category/12915.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 October 2004 |title=AMA (WPC) Table 4 - Women Residents by Specialty - 2005 |date=25 September 2015 |work=Women Physicians Congress (WPC) |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women continue to dominate in nursing. In 2000, 94.6% of registered nurses in the United States were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/healthworkforce/reports/rnsurvey/rnss1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030212144558/http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/healthworkforce/reports/rnsurvey/rnss1.htm |archivedate=2003-02-12 |deadurl=yes |title=The Registered Nurse Population |date=March 2000 |work=bhpr.hrsa.gov |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In health care professions as a whole in the US, women numbered approximately 14.8 million, as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/05/13/womens-health-at-work/ |title = Women’s Health at Work |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |accessdate = 21 January 2015 |date = 13 May 2013 |first1 = Naomi |last1 = Swanson |first2 = Julie |last2 = Tisdale-Pardi |first3 = Leslie |last3 = MacDonald |first4 = Hope M. |last4 = Tiesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomedical research and academic medical professions—i.e., faculty at medical schools—are also disproportionately male. Research on this issue, called the "leaky pipeline" by the [[National Institutes of Health]] and other researchers, shows that while women have achieved parity with men in entering graduate school, a variety of discrimination causes them to drop out at each stage in the academic pipeline: graduate school, [[postdoc]], faculty positions, achieving tenure; and, ultimately, in receiving recognition for groundbreaking work.&lt;ref&gt;The term was coined by S.E. Berryman in "Who Will Do Science?", 1983; see Louise Luckenbill-Edds, [http://www.ascb.org/index.cfm?id=1584&amp;navid=112&amp;tcode=nws3 "2000 WICB / Career Strategy Columns (Archive)"], Nov. 1, 2000, WICB Newsletter, ''American Society for Cell Biology''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Pell, "Fixing the Leaky Pipeline: Women Scientists in Academia", ''Journal of Animal Science'', v.74, pp. 2843-2848 (1996), available online at [http://jas.fass.org/cgi/reprint/74/11/2843.pdf (PDF) ''Journal of Animal Science''], FASS.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Clark Blickenstaff, "Women and Science Careers: Leaky Pipeline or Gender Filter?", ''Gender and Education'', v.17, n.4, pp. 369-386 (Oct. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], ''[[Beyond Bias and Barriers]]: Fulfilling the Potential of Women in Academic Science and Engineering''.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[women in science]] for a broader discussion.)

=== Glass ceiling ===
The [[glass ceiling]] is used as a metaphor to convey the undefined obstacles that women and minorities face in the workplace.

One study surveyed physician mothers and their physician daughters in order to analyze the effect that discrimination and harassment have on the individual and their career. This study included 84% of physician mothers that graduated medical school prior to 1970, with the majority of these physicians graduating in the 1950s and 1960s. The authors of this study stated that discrimination in the medical field persisted after the title VII discrimination legislation was passed in 1965.&lt;ref name="10.1089/jwh.2006.0127"&gt;Shrier, Diane K.; Zucker, Alyssa N.; Mercurio, Andrea E.; Landry, Laura J.; Rich, Michael; Shrier, Lydia A. (2007). "Generation to Generation: Discrimination and Harassment Experiences of Physician Mothers and Their Physician Daughters".&amp;nbsp;''Journal of Women's Health''.&amp;nbsp;'''16'''&amp;nbsp;(6): 1–13.&amp;nbsp;{{doi|10.1089/jwh.2006.0127}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to this study, one third of physician daughters reported experiencing a form of gender discrimination in medical school, field training, and the work environment. This study also stated that both generations equally experienced gender discrimination within their work environments.

This article provided an overview on the history of gender discrimination, claiming that gender initiated the systematic exclusion of women from medical schools. This was the case until 1970, when the National Organization for Women (NOW) filed a class action lawsuit against all medical schools in the United States. &amp;nbsp;More specifically, this lawsuit was successful in forcing medical schools to comply to the civil rights legislation. This success was seen by 1975 when the number of women in medicine had nearly tripled, and continued to grow as the years progressed. By 2005, over 25% of physicians and around 50% of medical school students were women. The increase of women in medicine also came with an increase of women identifying as a racial/ethnic minority, yet this population is still largely underrepresented in comparison to the general population of the medical field.&lt;ref name="10.1089/jwh.2006.0127"/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Within this specific study, 22% of physician mothers and 24% of physician daughters identified themselves as being an ethnic minority. These women reported experiencing instances of exclusion from career opportunities as a result of their [[Intersectionality|race and gender]].&amp;nbsp;

In an article titled "I'm too used to it”: A longitudinal qualitative study of third year female medical students' experiences of gendered encounters in medical education," the author described how confidence in ability varies based upon gender. According to this article, females tend to have lessened confidence in their abilities as a doctor, yet their performance is equivalent to that of their male counterparts. This study also commented on the impact of power dynamics within medical school, which is established as a hierarchy that ultimately shapes the educational experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Specifically, this article described how power dynamics led to the formation of a “hidden curriculum” in medical school, which revolves around understanding the contribution of gender roles in regards to being a female doctor. According to this article, this position holds females more accountable for their actions as a result of unrealistic expectations set forth by these gender roles, which expects female doctors to take on a nurturing and matronly persona when dealing with patients. The hidden curriculum, according to this article, is an integral aspect of a female's medical education that must be learned in order to tolerate instances of gender discrimination.

On the topic of power dynamics, another study commented on the nature of sexual harassment, stating that it was most commonly perpetrated within career training stages, by people in positions of power. According to this article, instances of sexual harassment attribute to the high attrition rates of females in the STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Clancy K. H., Nelson R. G., Rutherford J. N., Hinde K. | year = 2014 | title = Survey of Academic Field Experiences (SAFE): Trainees Report Harassment and Assault | url = | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 9 | issue = 7| pages = 1–9 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0102172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study describes sexual harassment as a growing problem due to the fact that it goes widely underreported, which is said to be caused by the transient nature of career training, alongside weak policies and the perpetrators holding positions of power over the victim.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babaria|first=Palav|last2=Abedin|first2=Sakena|last3=Berg|first3=David|last4=Nunez-Smith|first4=Marcella|date=2012-04-01|title="I'm too used to it": A longitudinal qualitative study of third year female medical students' experiences of gendered encounters in medical education|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953612000780|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=74|issue=7|pages=1013–1020|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.11.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's Contributions to Medicine in the United States==

Women have successfully provided the world with information not previously known. A few women who provided knowledge were:
 
'''Helen Brooke Taussig:''' ''The First Female President of the American Heart Association''

[[Helen B. Taussig|Helen Brooke Taussig]] was born on May 24, 1898, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. She is most commonly known as the first female president of the American Heart Association&lt;ref name=TaussigEB&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Helen-Brooke-Taussig|title=Helen Brooke Taussig {{!}} American physician|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taussig was diagnosed with [[Dyslexia]] when she was young. Around the same time, her mother, Edith Guild Taussig (1861-1909) died.&lt;ref name=TaussigEB/&gt; Her father, [[Frank William Taussig]] (1859-1940), was an economist and educator in the United States. He was also known for creating the "Foundation of Modern [[International trade|Trade Theory"]].  Taussig earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B]] from [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1921. In 1922 she applied at [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard University's Medical School]], and was denied. The University was not accepting women at the time. Instead she graduated from [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]] in 1927. In her 30s, Taussig grew deaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/013500/013565/html/13565bio.html|title=Helen Brooke Taussig|last=Morton|first=Lauren|date=2005|website=Archives of Maryland|archive-url=|archive-date=December 5, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Taussig was appointed the Head of he Children's Hear Clinic at the Harriet Lane home, which was part of Johns Hopkins University. Due to her inability to hear, Taussig found an alternative method to studying the heartbeat in children by feeling the beat with her hands. This method lead her to discover [[Blue baby syndrome|"Blue Baby Syndrome]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blalock|first=Alfred|date=1945-05-19|title=THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF MALFORMATIONS OF THE HEART|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.1945.02860200029009|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|language=en|volume=128|issue=3|doi=10.1001/jama.1945.02860200029009|issn=0002-9955|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was termed so due to the cyanotic hue resembling babies who were thought to be ill. In 1947, a surgeon named [[Alfred Blalock]] teamed up with Taussig and wrote an article called,&lt;ref&gt;"Congenital Malformations of the Heart",&lt;/ref&gt; which explored their creation and alternative approach for a stunt-"[[Blalock–Taussig shunt|Blalock-Taussig Shunt]]"- that would help circulate blood from the lungs to the heart. In the article it states, "The operation here reported and the studies leading thereto were undertaken with the conviction that even though the structure of the heart was grossly abnormal, in many instances it might be possible to alter the course of the circulation in such a manner as to lessen the 'cyanosis' and the resultant disability." (Read before the [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] Medical Society, March 12, 1945.) Taussig received multiple awards after 1950. In 1954, Taussig received the Albert Lasker award, which is awarded for outstanding contributions to medicine. In 1959, Taussig was acknowledged for being one of the first women who received full professorship to Johns Hopkins University. In 1964, Taussig was awarded the [[Medal of Freedom|medal of freedom]] from President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Finally, in 1965, Taussig was known as the first women of the [[American Heart Association]], for which she is so prominently known for. To further her interest in pediatrics, nearly a decade and a half later in the 1960s, Taussig remained to advocate for children's&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; health. She was "responsible for investigating the epidemic of serious congenital limb malformations". This investigation focused on European children and Taussig had a theory that the malformations were caused by the use of [[Thalidomide]]. She resolved this ongoing issue by persuading the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to discontinue the use and sale of Thalidomide in the U.S

'''Helen Flanders Dunbar:''' ''The "Mother" of Holistic Medicine''

[[Helen Flanders Dunbar]] was born in [[Chicago]] on May 14, 1902, and Dunbar was the oldest child. Dunbar's mother, Edith Vaughn Flanders (1871-1963), was an Episcopalian clergyman's daughter as well as a professional [[Genealogy|Genealogist]]. Dunbar's father, Francis William Dunbar (1868-1939), was very much established as well due to his standing as an electrical engineer, as well as a patent attorney. In her early life, Dunbar's education was strictly limited to tutors and attending private schools. She graduated from [[Brearley School]], which was located in [[New York City]], in 1919, which lead to her enrollment in [[Bryn Mawr College]]. At this particular point in her life her interest in [[theology]], [[philosophy]], and medicine. Dunbar met [[James H. Leuba|James Henry Leuba]] at [[Bryn Mawr College]], which sparked her interest due to his standing as a psychologist of religion at the college. In the summer of 1929, after successfully receiving a bachelor's degree in mathematics and psychology from [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], Dunbar continued her education by spending five weeks in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts receiving clinical training. In 1927, Dunbar received a [[bachelor's degree]] as [[Latin honors|"Magna Cum Laude]]" from Union Theological Seminar. This achievement was awarded primarily due to her thesis, "Methods Training in the Devotional Life Emphasized in the American Churches".&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; Dunbar also won a travelling Fellowship due to this particular piece of writing. From 1931 until 1936, Dunbar held the position as director of Joint Committee of the [[New York City]] Religion and Health of the Federal Council and Churches of the Academy of Medicine. From 1943 until the year before she died, Dunbar wrote an assortment of books including: [http://www.womeninmedicinemagazine.com/profile-of-women-in-medicine/helen-flanders-dunbar-pioneer-in-psychosomatic-medicine "Psychosomatic Diagnosis]" in 1943, "Mind, Body: Psychosomatic Medicine"&lt;ref name=Dunbar&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/helen-flanders-dunbar/|title=Helen Flanders Dunbar|last=Young|first=Tracy L.|date=2010|website=Psychology's Feminist Voices|archive-url=|archive-date=2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947, "Your Child's Mind and Body; A practical guide for parents" in 1949, and "Illness: the realization of an infant's fantasy with special reference to testing methods" in 1951. During the year of her death, Dunbar wrote "Accidents of Life Experience", "Basic aspects and applications of the psychology of safety", and "Psychiatry in medicine specialties".&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; Helen Flanders Dunbar died in 1959. She was found face down in her swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apa.divisions.org/divisions-35/about/heritage/helen-dunbar-biography.aspx|title=Biography: Helen Flanders Dunbar|last=|first=|date=2017|website=American Psychology Association|archive-url=|archive-date=November 23, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Midwifery in 18th Century America==
As per the documentary “A Midwife’s Tale”, historian of 18th century America, [[Laurel Thatcher Ulrich]], follows the diary of [[Martha Ballard]], which proves to be a telling source of women's roles as medical practitioners. Out of the different occupations women took on around this time, [[midwifery]] was the best paid of them all.&lt;ref name="Ulrich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ulrich|first1=Laurel Thatcher|title=A Midwife's Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard, Based on Her Diary, 1785-1812|date=1990|publisher=Knopf|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[18th century]], households tended to have an abundance of children largely in part to have a helping hand in responsibilities and to combat high mortality rates.&lt;ref name="McMillen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMillen|first1=Sally Gregory|title=Motherhood in the Old South: Pregnancy, Childbirth and Infant Rearing|date=1990|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807115177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the high chance of complications in labor, Martha Ballard, specifically, had high success rates in delivering healthy babies to healthy mothers.&lt;ref name="Ulrich" /&gt;

==Competition Between Midwifery and Obstetrics==
A shift from women midwifery to male obstetrics occurs in the growth of medical practices such as the founding of the [[American Medical Association]].&lt;ref name="Feldhusen" /&gt; Instead of assisting labor in the basis of an emergency, there were doctors such as Dr. Benjamin Page who wanted to take over the delivery of babies completely; putting midwifery second.&lt;ref name="Ulrich" /&gt; This is an example of the growing sense of competition between male physicians and female midwives as a rise in obstetrics took hold. The education of women on the basis of midwifery was stunted by both physicians and public-health reformers, driving midwifery to be seen as out of practice.&lt;ref name="Brodsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brodsky|first1=Phyllis L|title=Where have all the midwives gone?|journal=Journal of Perinatal Education|date=2008|volume=17|issue=4|doi=10.1624/105812408X324912|pmid=19436438|pmc=2582410|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Societal roles also played a fact in the downfall of the practice in midwifery because women were unable to obtain the education needed for licensing and once married, women were to embrace a domestic lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Feldhusen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://midwiferytoday.com/web-article/history-midwifery-childbirth-america-time-line/|last1=Feldhusen|first1=Adrian E|title=The History of Midwifery and Childbirth in America: A Time Line|website=Midwifery Today|publisher=Midwifery Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient medicine===
The involvement of women in the field of [[medicine]] has been recorded in several early civilizations. An [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] of the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] or [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Merit-Ptah]], described in an inscription as "chief physician", is the earliest woman named in the [[history of science]]. [[Agamede]] was cited by [[Homer]] as a healer in [[ancient Greece]] before the [[Trojan War]]. [[Agnodice]] was the first female [[physician]] to practice legally in 4th century BC [[Athens]].  [[Metrodora]] was a physician and generally regarded as the first [[medical writing|medical writer]]. Her book, ''On the Diseases and Cures of Women'', was the oldest medical book written by a female and was often referenced by many other female physicians. She credited much of her writings to the ideologies of [[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Influential Women In Medicine: From The Past To The Present|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/most-influential-women-medicine-past-present-270560|website=Medical Daily|accessdate=24 September 2017|language=en|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Europe===
During the [[Middle Ages]], [[convent]]s were an important place of education for women, and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly [[research]]. An example is the [[Germans|German]] [[abbess]] [[Hildegard of Bingen]], whose prolific writings include treatments of various scientific subjects, including [[medicine]], [[botany]] and [[natural history]] (c.1151-58).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html |title=Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179) |author=Sabina Flanagan |publisher=University of Adelaide |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406172530/http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html |archivedate=2005-04-06 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is considered Germany's first female [[physician]].&lt;ref name=hildegard&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Hildegard von Bingen | encyclopedia = Key Figures in Medieval Europe - An Encyclopedia | editor = Richard K.

Women in the Middle Ages participated in many healing techniques and capacities. According to historical documents, small numbers of women occupied almost all ranks of medical personnel during the period.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Monica|title=Women's Medical Practice and Health Care in Medieval Europe|journal=Signs|date=1989|volume=14|issue=2|pages=434–473|doi=10.1086/494516|jstor=3174557}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked as [[herbalists]], [[midwives]], [[surgeons]], [[barber-surgeons]], nurses, and traditional [[empirics]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minkowski|first1=William L.|title=Women healers of the middle ages: selected aspects of their history.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=1992|volume=82|issue=2|pages=288–295|doi=10.2105/ajph.82.2.288|pmid=1739168|pmc=1694293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women treated everyone, not only women as historians once thought. The names of 24 women described as surgeons in Naples between 1273 and 1410 are known, and references have been found to 15 women practitioners, most of them Jewish and none described as midwives, in Frankfurt between 1387 and 1497.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siraisi|first1=Nancy G.|title=Medieval and Early Renaissance Medicine: An Introduction to Knowledge and Practice|date=2009-05-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-76131-2|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Women also engaged in midwifery and healing arts without leaving any trace of their activities in written records, and practiced in rural areas or where there was little access to medical care.
Society in the Middle Ages limited women's role as physician. Once universities established faculties of medicine during the thirteenth century, women were excluded from advanced medical education.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Licensure began to require clerical vows for which women were ineligible, and healing as a profession became male dominated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In many occasions, women had to fight against accusation of illegal practice done by males, putting into question their real motives. If they were not accused of malpractice, then women were considered "witches" by both clerical and civil authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minkowski|first1=WL|title=Women healers of the middle ages: selected aspects of their history|date=1992|journal=Am J Public Health|pmc=1694293|pmid=1739168|volume=82|issue=2|pages=288–95|doi=10.2105/ajph.82.2.288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because surgeons and barber-surgeons were often organized into guilds, they could hold out longer against the pressures of licensure. Like other guilds, a number of the barber-surgeon guilds allowed the daughters and wives of their members to take up membership in the guild, generally after the man's death. According to documents, Katherine la surgiene of London, daughter of Thomas the surgeon and sister of William the Surgeon belonged to a guild in 1286.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rawcliffe|first1=Carole|title=Medicine and Society in Later Medieval England|date=1997|publisher=Sutton|location=Stroud, Gloucestershire|isbn=978-0-7509-1497-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation of female members in the guilds of Lincoln, Norwich, Dublin and York continue until late in the period. Midwives, those who assisted pregnant women through childbirth and some aftercare, included only women. Midwives constituted roughly one third of female medical practitioners.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Men did not involve themselves in women's medical care, likewise, women did not involve themselves in men's health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Monica|title=Women's Medical Practice and Health Care in Medieval Europe|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|jstor=3174557|volume=14|issue=2|pages=434–473|doi=10.1086/494516|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The southern [[Italy|Italian]] coastal town of Salerno was an important center of medical learning and practice in the 12th century.  There, the physician [[Trota of Salerno]] gathered a number of her medical practices in several written collections.  One work on women's medicine that was associated with her, the ''De curis mulierum'' ("On Treatments for Women") formed the core of what came to be known as the ''[[Trotula]]'' ensemble, a compendium of three texts that circulated throughout medieval Europe.  Trota herself gained a reputation that spread as far as France and England.  There are also references in the writings of other Salernitan physicians to the ''mulieres Salernitane'' ("Salernitan women"), which give some idea of local empirical practices.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The 'Trotula': A Medieval Compendium of Women’s Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dorotea Bucca]] was another distinguished Italian physician. She held a chair of philosophy and medicine at the University of Bologna for over forty years from 1390.&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite journal| author= JS Edwards |title= A Woman Is Wise: The Influence of Civic and Christian Humanism on the Education of Women in Northern Italy and England during the Renaissance |journal=Ex Post Facto: Journal of the History Students at San Francisco State University |volume =XI | year=2002 |url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~epf/2002/edwards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RoqNOWuNa8oC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22dorotea+bucca%22 Howard S.

===Medieval Islamic world===
For the medieval Islamic world, little specific information is known about female medical practitioners although it is likely that women were regularly involved in medical practice in some capacity.  Male medical writers refer to the presence of female practitioners (singular, ''ṭabība'') in describing certain procedures or situations.  For example, the late 10th/early 11th century Andalusi physician and surgeon [[al-Zahrawi]], in explaining how to excise bladder stones, notes that the procedure is difficult for male doctors practicing on female patients: because of the need to touch the genitalia, the male practitioner must either find a female doctor who can perform the procedure, or a eunuch physician, or a midwife who takes instruction from the male surgeon.  In other words, even though direct evidence for female practitioners is rare, their existence can be inferred.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, "History of Science," ''Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures''.  Volume I: ''Methodologies, Paradigms and Sources'', Suad Joseph, general editor (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2003), pp. 358-61; Peter Pormann, "Female Patients and Practitioners in Medieval Islam," ''The Lancet'' 373 (May 9, 2009), pp. 1598-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  As al-Zahrawi's example also suggests, midwives played an important role in the delivery of women's healthcare.  For these practitioners, there is more detailed information, both in terms of the prestige of their craft ([[ibn Khaldun]] calls it a noble craft, "something necessary in civilization") and in terms of biographical information on historic women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Giladi Avner | year = 2010 | title = Liminal Craft, Exceptional Law:  Preliminary Notes on Midwives in Medieval Islamic Writings | url = | journal = International Journal of Middle East Studies | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 185–202 | doi=10.1017/s0020743810000012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Molénat, "Priviligiées ou poursuivies: quatre sages-femmes musulmanes dans la Castille du XVe siècle," ''Identidades marginales'', ed.

===Western medicine in China===
[[Traditional Chinese medicine]] based on the use of [[Chinese herbology|herbal medicine]], [[acupuncture]], [[Traditional Chinese massage|massage]] and other forms of therapy has been practiced in China for thousands of years.  However, Western Medicine was introduced to China in the 19th Century, mainly by medical missionaries sent from various Christian mission organizations, such as the [[London Missionary Society]] (Britain), the [[Methodism|Methodist]] Church (Britain) and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States|Presbyterian Church]] (US). [[Benjamin Hobson]] (1816-1873), a medical missionary sent by the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1839, set up a highly successful Wai Ai Clinic (惠愛醫館) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ifeng.com/article/46027.html |title=回眸：当年传教士进羊城_MW悦读室之岭南话廊_凤凰博报- 博采众家之言 报闻公民心声-凤凰网 |publisher=Blog.ifeng.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/Article/GDSI199901009.htm |title=合信的《全体新论》与广东士林-《广东史志》1999年01期-中国知网 |publisher=Mall.cnki.net |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Guangzhou, China. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] (香港華人西醫書院) was founded in 1887 by the [[London Missionary Society]], with its first graduate (in 1892) being [[Sun Yat-sen]] (孫中山).  Sun later led the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]], which changed China from an empire to a republic. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] was the forerunner of the School of Medicine of the [[University of Hong Kong]], which started in 1911.

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near to one another, women of China were reluctant to be treated by Western male doctors. This resulted in a tremendous need for female doctors. One of these was [[Sigourney Trask]] of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who set-up a hospital in [[Fuzhou]] during the mid-19th century. Trask also arranged for a local girl, [[Hü King Eng]], to study medicine at [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College]], with the intention that Hü would return to practise western medicine in Fuzhou. After graduation, Hü became the resident physician at Fuzhou's [[Woolston Memorial Hospital]] in 1899 and trained several female physicians.&lt;ref name=Burton&gt;{{cite book | title=Notable Women of Modern China | last1=Burton | first1=Margaret E. | author-link=Margaret E.

===Women's health movement in the 1970s===
The 1970s marked a great increase of women entering and graduating from [[medical school]]{{where|date=August 2015}}. From 1930 to 1970, a period of 40 years, about 14,000 women graduated from medical school. From 1970 to 1980, a period of 10 years, over 20,000 women graduated from medical school.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi, Michele A. and Gertrude A. Streuernage, ed., Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines (New York: Harrington Park Press, 1990), 236.&lt;/ref&gt; This increase of women in the medical field was due to both political and cultural changes.

Two laws in the United States lifted restrictions for women in the medical field -- [[Title IX]] of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1972 and the [[Public Health Service Act]] of 1975, banning discrimination on grounds of gender. In November 1970, the Assembly of the Association of American Medical Colleges rallied for equal rights in the medical field.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi and Streuernage, ''Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines,'' 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, women's ideas about themselves and their relation to the medical field were shifting due to the [[women's movement]].

A sharp increase of women in the medical field led to developments in doctor patient relationships, changes in terminology and theory. One area of medical practice that was challenged and changed was [[gynecology]]. Wendy Kline &lt;ref&gt;Kline, Wendy. ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave'' (University of Chicago Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; talks about the blurring of "clinical" and "sexual" that occurred in the medical field in the late 40s into the 60s, particularly in gynecology. Kline says that "to ensure that young brides were ready for the wedding night, they [doctors] used the [[pelvic exam]] as a form of sex instruction ."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave,'' p 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ellen Frankfort's book ''Vaginal Politics'', Frankfort talks about the "shame" and "humiliation" felt during a pap test; "I was naked, he was dressed; I was lying down, he was standing up; I was quiet, he was giving orders "&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, Ellen. ''Vaginal Politics'' (New York: Vintage, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

With higher numbers of women enrolled in medical school, medical practices like gynecology were challenged and changed.  One medical student is quoted in Kline's book as saying, "Since I experienced my own exams as a humiliating procedure, I feared inflicting the same humiliation on another person."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972 the University of Iowa Medical School instituted a new training program for pelvic and breast examinations. Students would act both as the doctor and the patient, allowing each student to understand the procedure and create a more gentle, respectful examination. This method was quite different from the previous practice in which doctors were taught to assert their power over patients. With changes in ideologies and practices throughout the 70s, by 1980 over 75 schools had adopted this new method.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi and Streuernage, ''Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines,'' 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

With women entering the medical field and women's rights movements came also the women's health movement which sought alternative methods of health care for women. This came through the creation of self-help books, most notably ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]: A Book by and for Women''.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Women’s Health Book Collective Staff, ''Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women'' (Boston: Simon and Schuster Trade, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This book gave women a "manual" to help understand their body. It challenged hospital treatment, and doctors' practices. Aside from self-help books, many help centres were opened: birth centres run by [[midwives]], safe [[abortion]] centres, and classes for educating women on their bodies, all with the aim of providing non-judgmental, warm, and comfortable care for women.&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, Bruce J. The Seventies: The Great Shift in American Culture, Society, and politics. (Da Capo Press, 2002), 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Kline speaks to this claim women were taking on their body in relation to the medical world; women felt that "not only should women have access to information about their bodies... they should also help to create this knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The women's health movement, along with women involved in the medical field, opened the doors for research and awareness for female illness like [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]].

While scholars in the history of medicine had developed some study of women in the field—biographies of pioneering women physicians were common prior to the 1960s—the study of women in medicine took particular root with the advent of the [[women's movement]] in the 1960s, and in conjunction with the [[women's health movement]].  Two publications in 1973 were critical in establishing the women's health movement and scholarship about women in medicine: First, the publication of ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' in 1973 by the Boston Women's Health Collective,&lt;ref&gt;''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; and second, "Witches, Midwives, and Nurses: A History of Female Healers", a short paper by [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and [[Deirdre English]] also in 1973.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich-English-1973-Witches" /&gt; The Ehrenreich/English paper examined the history of women in medicine as the professionalization of the field excluded women, particularly [[midwifery|midwives]], from the practice.  Ehrenreich and English later expanded the work into a full-length book, ''[[For Her Own Good]]'', which connected the exclusion of women from the practice of medicine to [[sexism|sexist]] medical practices; this text and ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' became key texts in the women's health movement. The English/Ehrenreich text laid out some early insights about the professionalization of medicine and the exclusion of women from the profession, and numerous scholars, such as [[Diana Elizabeth Long]], have greatly built upon and expanded this work.

'''A.I. Alikhanyan National Science Laboratory''' ({{Lang-hy|Ա.Ի. Ալիխանյանի անվան Ազգային Գիտական Լապորատորիա}}) is a [[research]] institute, located in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]]. It was founded in 1943 as a branch of [[Yerevan State University]] by brothers [[Abraham Alikhanov]] and [[Artem Alikhanian]]. It was often referred to by the acronym Yerevan Physics Institute (YerPhI). In 2011 it was renamed as A.I. Alikhanyan National Science Laboratory.

==History and strategy==
The Yerevan Physics Institute was founded in 1943 as a branch of Yerevan State University by brothers Abraham Alikhanov and Artem Alikhanian. Later two high-altitude cosmic ray stations were founded on Mount Aragats (3,200 m) and Nor Amberd (2,000 m). [[File:YerPhI.jpg|thumb|The view of the Yerevan Physics Institute]]
In 1963 the institute was transferred to the Soviet Union Atomic Energy State Committee. The construction of a 6 GeV electron synchrotron accomplished in 1967 became an important landmark in the history of institute, it is the first particle accelerator in Armenia (Arus "ԱՐՈՒՍ"). After collapse of Soviet Union YerPhI continued research in the fields of high-energy physics and astrophysics in Armenia and worldwide using world biggest accelerators and cosmic ray detectors. Now YerPhI get status of A. Alikhanyan National Laboratory.

===Brief summary of scientific activities===
Among the key results of YerPhI in the early years were the discovery of protons and neutrons in cosmic rays, and the establishment of the first evidence of existence of the particles with masses between that of muons and protons. The high altitude research stations have remained the main research base of the Cosmic Ray Division (CRD) of YerPhI until now. Among the CRD achievements there were: discovery of sharp knee in light components of primary cosmic rays, detection of the highest energy protons accelerated on the Sun, and the creation of the Aragats Space environ¬mental Center in 2000 for studies of the solar-terrestrial connection, where CRD becomes one of the world’s leaders.

The 6 GeV electron synchrotron was accomplished in 1967. During 1970-1991 synchrotron was operated with energies up to 4,5 GeV and in Experimental Physics Division were obtained significant results, including: hadronic properties of photons in   π- meson photo-production on nuclei; structures of nucleon resonances in multi-polarization experiments, structure and characteristics of nuclear matter, important properties of X-ray transition radiation and channeling in monocrystals. Thanks to these achievements physicists from Yerevan Physics Institute started from 1985 are successfully participating in the large international collaborations.

Traditional topic of YerPhI is the development of new particle detectors. Wide spark chambers and transition radiation detectors are examples of the experimental techniques developed and implemented in YerPhI. During the last years groups of scientists from Yerevan Physics Institute have actively participated in intermediate and high energy physics experiments abroad (JLAB, DESY, CERN-LHC, [[MAX-lab]], MAMI), exploring the meson and nucleon structures, electromagnetic interactions of the nucleon, quark-hadron duality, short range nucleon-nucleon correlations, quark hadronization in nuclear medium, physics beyond standard model, Higgs boson searches, quark-gluon plasma, fission and fragmentation of nuclei and hypernuclei and many other topics, as well as constructing experimental hardware and develop the software for data acquisition and analysis.
The theoretical department assure major achievements in the following areas: B-meson physics, QCD and Related Phenomenology, Neutrino physics, Quantum Field Theory, String/M-theory, Integrable Models, Statistical physics, Condensed Matter and Quantum Information. These results are internationally recognized and highly cited.

In the mid-1980s in YerPhI was developed the concept of stereoscopic approach in Very High Energy gamma-ray astronomy using multiple Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT). This concept was materialized in the very successful IACT system (HEGRA). After first success, Armenian physicists successfully participate in operation of the IACT systems on the Canary islands (MAGIC) and in Namibia (H.E.S.S.).
In the course of many years, the Applied Physics Department of YerPhI successfully investigates electron-energy structure of new wide-band laser materials using synchrotron radiation in various spectral regions. The investigations were carried in DESY and will be continued in MaxLab- II (Sweden).

Below are the integral parameters characterizing the efficiency of research conducted by national lab: number of publications and citations. The sizable enlargement of both parameters during last years is apparent. National lab scientists publish appr. 30% of scientific publications of Armenia. Most of publications appear in high impact factor journals; high quality of research in national lab is proved by citations – more than 60% of overall citations to papers published by scientists from Armenia belong to national lab.

==Structure==
The YerPhI has seven divisions and Computer Centre.

Experimental physics workshops are also parts of the institute. The main fields of research are:
* elementary particle physics
* nuclear physics
* cosmic ray physics and astrophysics
* theoretical physics
* condensed matter physics
* radiobiology
* Isotop investigation and production
* computer networking, computing
