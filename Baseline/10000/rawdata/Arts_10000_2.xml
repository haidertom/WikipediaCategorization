'''Advertising slogans''' are short phrases used in [[advertising campaign]]s to generate publicity and unify a company's marketing strategy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-tagline-4017760|title=Creating and Using Taglines as Marketing Tools|work=The Balance|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrases may be used to attract attention to a distinctive product feature or reinforce a company's brand.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dowling|first=Grahame R.|last2=Kabanoff|first2=Boris|date=1996-01-01|title=Computer-aided content analysis: What do 240 advertising slogans have in common?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00557312|journal=Marketing Letters|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=63–75|doi=10.1007/BF00557312|issn=0923-0645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and nomenclature==
According to the 1913 [[Webster's Dictionary]], a [[wikt:slogan|slogan]] ({{IPA|/ˈsloʊɡən/}}) derives from the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] "[[army|sluagh]]-[[Shout (sound)|ghairm]]" (an [[Battle cry|army cry]]). Its contemporary definition denotes a distinctive advertising motto or advertising phrase used by any entity to convey a purpose or ideal. This is also known as a [[catchphrase]]. [[Tagline]]s or [[Tagline|tags]] are American terms describing brief public communications to promote certain products and services. In the UK, they are called ''end lines'' or ''straplines.'' ss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adslogans.co.uk/ans/nomenclature.html|title=The Art and Science of the Advertising Slogan|date=|publisher=Adslogans.co.uk|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424235057/http://www.adslogans.co.uk/ans/nomenclature.html|archivedate=24 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no|accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, advertising slogans are called {{nihongo|''catchcopy''|キャッチコピー|kyatchi kopī}} or {{nihongo|''catch phrase''|キャッチフレーズ|kyatchi furēzu}}.

== Format of advertising slogans ==
Most corporate [[Advertising|advertisements]] are short, memorable phrases, often between 3 and 5 words.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Slogans adopt different tones to convey different meanings. For example, funny slogans can enliven conversation and increase memorability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Slogans often unify diverse corporate advertising pieces across different mediums.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Slogans may be accompanied by logos, brand names, or musical jingles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yalch|first=R. F|date=1991|title=Memory in a jingle-jungle: music as a mnemonic device in communicating advertising slogans.|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cms&amp;AN=CAX0150030000712&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site.|journal=Journal  of Applied Psychology|volume=76|pages=268–275|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of advertising slogans ==
Some [[slogans]] are created for specific limited-time campaigns; others are intended as long-term corporate slogans. Various slogans start out as the former and are, over time, converted into the latter as [[idea]]s take hold with the [[public]]. Some advertising slogans retain their influence even after general use is discontinued. If an advertising slogan enters into the public vernacular, word-of-mouth communication may increase consumer awareness of the product and extend an ad campaign's lifespan.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Vince|date=2007|title=Social Uses of Advertising|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cms&amp;AN=24997138&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site.|journal=International Journal of Advertising|volume=|pages=199–222|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slogans that associate emotional responses or evoke recollections of past memories increase their likelihood to be adopted by the public and shared.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, by linking a slogan to a commonplace discussion topic (e.g. [[Psychological stress|stress]], [[food]], [[traffic]]), consumers will recall the slogan more often and associate the corporation with their personal experiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

If a slogan is adopted by the public, it can have a notable influence in everyday social interaction. Slogans can serve as connection points between community members as individuals share pithy taglines in conversation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In contrast, if an individual is unaware of a popular slogan or tagline, they can be socially excluded from conversation and disengage from the discussion.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Social control===
Advertising slogans as a system of social control include devices similar to [[watchword]]s, catchwords, and [[motto]]es.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The slogan comes from the Scotch and originated in the clans wars for the objective of control.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SaaMoSC"&gt;"Slogans As A Means Of Social Control". By Frederick E. Lumley. ''Papers and Proceedings of the American Sociological Society'', Volume 16, 1921. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OpEDAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA121 p. 121–134].&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of slogans may be examined in so far as the slogans elicit unconscious and unintentional responses.&lt;ref name="SaaMoSC" /&gt;

== The ongoing argument ==
Quantifying the effects of an effective, or ineffective, ad campaign can prove challenging to scholars. Critics argue taglines are a self-gratifying, unnecessary form of corporate branding that is neither memorable nor pithy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  However, proponents argue if taglines enter everyday public discourse, the company's market influence could exponentially increase.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''Apparition of the Virgin to St. Bernard''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] painter [[Filippino Lippi]], completed around 1485–1487.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, Eliot W., and Marilyn Bradshaw. "Lippi family." Grove Art Online. January 01, 2003. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in the [[Badia Fiorentina]], a church in [[Florence]].

The picture was commissioned for the chapel of Francesco del Pugliese by the latter's son Piero, who is portrayed in the lower right corner in the traditional praying posture of the [[donor portrait]].

It is one of the most admired Lippi's works,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artonline.it/opera.asp?IDOpera=1424 Page at artonline.it] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001102/http://www.artonline.it/opera.asp?IDOpera=1424 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its powerful, Flemish-inspired chromatism and attention to details, which contribute in turning the mystical apparition of the Virgin to [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]] into an everyday life scene. The composition is set in a rocky landscape in which the saint, while writing on his [[lectern]], is suddenly visited by the Virgin. Behind Bernard's shoulders is depicted the demon biting his chains: this is a reference to a medieval hymn celebrating the Virgin as the liberator of humanity from the chains of their sins.

A scroll on a rock contains a verse by the 3rd century AD [[Stoicism|stoic]] writer [[Epictetus]]: ''Sustine et abstine'' ("Carry on and abstain"), a hint to Bernard's teachings.

Some scholars have identified in the faces of the Virgin and the angels on the left the portraits of the donor's wife and sons

'''C++/WinRT''' is the officially supported, modern C++ language projection for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Runtime]] platform, designed to provide you with first-class access to the modern [[Windows API]]. The C++/WinRT language projection is ''not'' an extension to the C++ language; rather, it's implemented as an entirely standard modern ISO C++17 header-file-based library. With C++/WinRT, you can author and consume Windows Runtime APIs using any standards-compliant C++17 compiler.

C++/WinRT ships as part of the [[Microsoft Windows SDK]]. It was introduced in version 10.0.17134.0 (Windows 10, version 1803) of the SDK. There is also [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] support for C++/WinRT, by means of project and item templates, as well as MSBuild properties and targets. Visual Studio support is provided in the form of the [https://aka.ms/cppwinrt/vsix/ C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension] (VSIX), which you can download and install from the [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/ Visual Studio Marketplace].

C++/WinRT was originally released in 2015 by [https://kennykerr.ca/ Kenny Kerr]. Shortly afterward, the technology and Kerr's expertise were brought in-house to [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name="Kk2Ms"&gt;[https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/mt745090.aspx How Kenny Kerr Brought C++/WinRT to Microsoft] MSDN Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; C++/WinRT is now Microsoft's recommended replacement for both the [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh438466.aspx Windows Runtime C++ Template Library] (WRL), and for [[C++/CX]].&lt;ref name="IntroToCppWinRT"&gt;[https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/intro-to-using-cpp-with-winrt/ Introduction to C++/WinRT] docs.microsoft.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

[[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Runtime]] is based on [[Component Object Model]] (COM) APIs, and it's designed to be accessed through ''language projections''. A language projection hides the COM details, and provides a more natural programming experience for a given language. For C++ developers, C++/WinRT is the officially supported, modern C++ language projection.

As of version 10.0.17134.0 (Windows 10, version 1803), the [[Microsoft Windows SDK]] contains a header-file-based standard C++ library for consuming first-party [[Windows API]]s (that is, [[Windows Runtime]] [[API]]s in Windows namespaces).&lt;ref name="IntroToCppWinRT"/&gt; C++/WinRT also ships with the &lt;code&gt;cppwinrt.exe&lt;/code&gt; tool, which you can point at a [[Windows Runtime]] metadata (.winmd) file to generate a header-file-based standard C++ library that ''projects'' the APIs described in the metadata for consumption from C++/WinRT code. [[Windows Runtime]] metadata (.winmd) files provide a canonical way of describing a Windows Runtime API surface. By pointing the &lt;code&gt;cppwinrt.exe&lt;/code&gt; tool at metadata, you can generate a library for use with any runtime class implemented in a second- or third-party Windows Runtime component, or implemented in your own application.

With C++/WinRT, you can also implement your own runtime classes using standard C++, without resorting to COM-style programming. For a runtime class, you describe your types in a [https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/midl-3/intro/ MIDL file] (.idl), and from that file the &lt;code&gt;midl.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cppwinrt.exe&lt;/code&gt; tools generate your implementation boilerplate source code files for you, ready for you to add your implementation. You can alternatively just implement interfaces by deriving from a base class that's part of the C++/WinRT header library. These techniques employ the [[curiously recurring template pattern]] for convenient and performant function-calling via static dispatch. In general, C++/WinRT makes clever and efficient use of a host of modern ISO C++11 (and later) language features to the benefit of developer productivity and run-time performance. Features that were not available when C++/WinRT's predecessors ([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh438466.aspx WRL] and [[C++/CX]]) were designed.

You use standard C++ data types, algorithms, and keywords when you use C++/WinRT. The projection does have its own custom data types, but in most cases you don't need to learn them because they provide appropriate conversions to and from standard types. That way, you can continue to use the standard C++ language features that you're accustomed to using, and the source code that you already have. C++/WinRT makes it extremely easy to call Windows Runtime APIs in any C++ application, from Win32 to UWP.

C++/WinRT performs better and produces smaller binaries than any other language option for the Windows Runtime. It even outperforms handwritten code using the application binary interface (ABI) directly. That's because the abstractions use modern C++ idioms that the Visual C++ compiler is designed to optimize. This includes magic statics, empty base classes, strlen elision, as well as many newer optimizations in the latest version of [[Microsoft Visual C++]] targeted specifically at improving the performance of C++/WinRT.

== History ==

Design and development of C++/WinRT was begun in 2014 by the then-independent software developer [https://kennykerr.ca/ Kenny Kerr]. At the time, the prevailing way for developers to call [[Windows Runtime]] APIs using C++ was with the [[C++/CX]] language projection. C++/CX adds non-standard extensions to the C++ language, such as the &lt;code&gt;ref new&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; (hat) notation inherited from C++/CLI. It hadn't been fully appreciated then that advances in ISO C++ language features meant that it had become possible to design a Windows Runtime language projection for pure standard C++, without extensions. "There are a lot of very experienced C++ developers at Microsoft who have spent decades-long careers working with C++ and COM," Kerr says. "I think it took someone who didn't realize that it was impossible to just try it anyway and show that it works."&lt;ref name="Kk2Ms"/&gt;

"I had had some previous experience projecting COM APIs into modern C++, so I decided to see whether I could apply those same techniques to the Windows Runtime." One early challenge in developing C++/WinRT was managing the trade-offs that the Windows Runtime makes to support projections for JavaScript and managed .NET languages out of the box. The complexity in the way that generic collections work across language projections is another example of these design challenges, as was coming up with an efficient way for standard C++ to handle the Windows Runtime's interface-versioning model. "It really pushed my understanding of C++ at that time, and it's since pushed the [[Microsoft Visual C++]] compiler to more efficiently handle such techniques at this scale."

=== Name ===

There is good reason for C++/WinRT's name to reference the [[Windows Runtime]] (WinRT), rather than the [[Universal Windows Platform]] (UWP). This is because you can call Windows Runtime APIs (and, therefore, you can benefit from C++/WinRT) in any C++ application, from Win32 to UWP.

'''Carnation''' (Latin, caro, carnis, “flesh”), in [[painting]], refers to the representation of [[color]] of [[flesh]]. It is also used in describing a painting or [[drawing]] to signify the undraped parts of a figure.

==Usage==
The use of carnation requires very attentive study and great skill in the painter. It varies with the sex of the individual, with the classes and countries to which the subjects belong, with the passions, the state of the health, etc. The [[cheek]]s are, in a healthy subject, of a lively red; the [[breast]], [[neck]] and upper part of the arms of a soft white; the belly yellowish. At the extremities the color becomes colder, and at the points assumes a [[violet (color)|violet]] tint, on account of the [[transparency and translucency|transparency]] of the skin. All these shades require to be softly blended. Two faults in carnation are chiefly to be avoided: hardness, the fault of the masters of the 15th century, and too great weakness. [[Guido Reni]] not infrequently painted his flesh so that it appeared almost bloodless. The French school has gone farthest in this respect. The flesh of the followers of this school often looks like [[porcelain]] or [[wax]]. [[Titian]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] are unrivaled in their rendering of carnation.

The '''Chigi Altarpiece''' is an altarpiece by [[Perugino]], dating to around 1506-1507. It is named after its commissioner [[Agostino Chigi]], a Sienese banker, for the Chigi family chapel in the church of [[Sant'Agostino (Siena)|Sant'Agostino]] in [[Siena]], where it still hangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Vittoria Garibaldi, ''Perugino'', in ''Pittori del Rinascimento'', Scala, Florence, 2004 {{ISBN|888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most altarpieces by Perugino, it has two registers. The upper heavenly one shows Christ on the cross surrounded by a symmetrical arrangement of angels and [[cherubim]]. The lower earthly register shows eight lamenting saints connected to the commissioner, the church and the chapel - on the right are [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jerome]], for example. The deep landscape backgrounds shows hills and a clear sky. The work originally also had a [[predella]], which is now divided between the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].

The '''coat of arms of the Transvaal''' was the official heraldic symbol of the [[South African Republic]] from 1866 to 1877 and again from 1881 to 1902, and later the symbol of the [[Transvaal Province]] from 1954 to 1994.  It is now obsolete.

==History==
The South African Republic was established in 1857.  On 18 February 1858, the [[Volksraad]] (legislature) resolved that the new state should have the following coat of arms:

{{quote|On a silver field there shall be placed a wagon and a golden anchor, while an eagle shall rest upon the arms.  On the right hand side of the arms a man in national costume with a gun and accessories.  On the left hand side a lion.|&lt;ref name=nps&gt;Brownell, F.G. (1993).  ''National and Provincial Symbols''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The earliest known appearance of the arms was on banknotes issued in 1866.&lt;ref name=misa&gt;Engelbrecht, C.L. (1987).  ''Money in South Africa''&lt;/ref&gt;  The crudely drawn arms were depicted as a shield with a lion, an anchor, and a man in the upper half, an ox-wagon in the lower half, and the motto 'Eendragt maakt magt' on a riband across the top.  This rendition also appeared on the ''Staatscourant'' (government gazette) from 1867.&lt;ref name=nps/&gt;

A better version, in which the shield was divided into sections, an eagle was perched on top, and three [[Flag of Transvaal|flags]] were draped down each side, first appeared on the postage stamps in 1869, and this became the preferred rendition.  From 1871, this too appeared on the banknotes,&lt;ref name=misa/&gt; and from 1872 it was on the masthead of the ''Staatscourant''.

The arms were in abeyance during the British occupation of the Transvaal, from 1877 to 1881.  Revived in 1881, they became obsolete again when the republic ceased to exist in 1902.

In 1950, the Transvaal provincial administration decided to adopt the old arms as provincial arms and commissioned chief archivist Dr [[Coenraad Beyers]] to investigate and report on the most suitable version.&lt;ref name=wz&gt;Beyers, C. (1950).  'Die Wapen van Die Suid-Afrikaanse Republiek' in ''Archives Year Book'' (1950)&lt;/ref&gt;  The arms were apparently introduced in 1954,&lt;ref name=nps/&gt; and they were used until the province ceased to exist in 1994.

==Blazon==

The arms were recorded at the [[College of Arms]] in July 1955, and registered at the [[Bureau of Heraldry (South Africa)|Bureau of Heraldry]] in October 1967.  The official blazon is:&lt;ref name=boh&gt;[http://www.national.archsrch.gov.za Bureau of Heraldry]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* An oval shield per fess, the chief divided per pale;  dexter  Gules, a natural lion contourne couchant gardant Or; sinister Azure, a bearded man  in  national dress  wearing  a hat and bandolier, and holding in the left hand a gun resting upon the ground; in base Vert, a  Voortrekker  wagon proper; on an inescutcheon Argent an anchor Sable, cabled Gules.
* Perched on the shield an eagle displayed Or.
* Behind the shield and draped  below on   both  sides  three  flags  of  the  South  African Republic, green, red, white and blue.
* Motto: EENDRACHT MAAKT MAGT&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Dream Pets''' are collectable miniature [[stuffed animal]]s, made of [[velveteen]] and filled with Willow sawdust, manufactured in Japan beginning in 1957 by Japanese toy designers Tochigi Mongi and Tomy for [[Dakin (company)|R. Dakin &amp;amp; Co.]] The manufacturer surprised Dakin by using these little toys as packing material for a shipment of battery operated [[toy train]]s which Dakin had ordered. That same day the president of Dakin, Roger Dakin, placed an order by cable to Japan for 25 dozen of the little velveteen toys, by the end of the day he changed his order to 300 dozen.By 1961 Dream Pets were being designed by Dakin's Senior toy designer Virginia Kemp in the United States. The toys became popular, and by the end of 1979 there were over 2000 different characters. In 1995 Dakin merged with The Applause Toy Co. Applause Toys re-issued copies of 24 of the vintage Dream Pets in 2004.

In late 2005, Dakin ceased to operate as an independent company. The names Dakin and Dream Pets were purchased by [[Chain store|retail chain]] [[Big Lots]], as of July 2011 Big lots had not produced any further Dream pets.

Paige Jansen-Nichols began anticipating ownership of her favorite childhood collectible – the Dream Pets, after seeing the Big Lots purchase. She watched and waited after Big Lots made the decision to liquidate the remaining Dream Pets inventory. Paige knew her dream could become a reality if she could just be patient and attentive. 

By 2014, the waiting was finally over, and Paige Jansen-Nichols immediately moved forward to acquire the brand. Paige as a child playing with the original line had been inspired to create her own Dream Pets. In her dream they would be larger, softer and more durable – so they could better withstand the love and imagination of children. Now they are here. The Dream Pets continue the whimsy and uniqueness of R. Dakin’s original designs and handmade feel. See more at http://www.dreampets.com/

The '''''Essential English Library''''' is a series of books, some [[fiction]] and some non-fiction, intended mainly for foreign students, though it is hoped that English readers may also find them of interest. The fiction has been chosen from some of the best writers, old and new, of [[English novel]]s, [[short stories]] and plays. The non-fiction consists of completely new books specially written for this series, on various aspects of [[England|English]] life and institutions.

The books are meant for serious adult students, and, though the vocabulary is carefully controlled, the style is natural and vigorous, and there is no question of any childish "writing down." The vocabulary is fundamentally that of the four books of Essential English. But, to widen the students' knowledge of the language, the same principle has been adopted in this series as in the later books of Essential English. So a number of new words (averaging three or four to a page) occur in each volume, but every new word is given, with the [[phonetic]] transcription, in the [[Glossary]] at the end of the book, and each word in the Glossary is defined within the vocabulary of ''Essential English''.

All the books are about the same length, and are illustrated with photographs or line drawings.&lt;ref&gt;The Country of the Blind and Other Stories, Fourth Impression 1954, [[Longmans, Green and Co]]. LTD.&lt;/ref&gt;

English teacher [[Charles Ewart Eckersley]] wrote ''Essential English for Foreign Students'', volumes 1-4, which were published by [[Longmans, Green and Co]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Essential English for Foreign Students [4 vols.]|url=https://www.librarything.com/work/9761053|publisher=Library Thing|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Fine Art of Leningrad''' is an important component of twentieth-century [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Soviet]] art, in the opinion of the art historians Vladimir Gusev and Vladimir Leniashin "one of its most powerful currents".&lt;ref&gt;В. А. Гусев, В. А. Леняшин. Ленинградскому изобразительному искусству шестьдесят лет / Изобразительное искусство Ленинграда. Выставка произведений ленинградских художников. Л: Художник РСФСР, 1981. С. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; This widely used term embraces the creative lives and the achievements of several generations of Leningrad painters, sculptors, graphic artists and creators of decorative and applied art from 1917 to the early 1990s.

== 1917—1923 ==

The revolutionary events of 1917–1918 changed the course of artistic life in [[Petrograd]]. They affected the Academy of Arts, exhibition and creative life, the activities of artistic associations and questions of artistic practice and theory. At the Academy of Arts students’ lessons were interrupted for a year and resumed only in autumn 1918. By a decree of the Council of People's Commissars issue on 12 April 1918 the Academy of Arts in the sense of an assembly of academicians was abolished. By the same decree for the training of future artists instead of the Higher Artistic College (VKhU) the Petrograd State Free Artistic Workshops (PGSKhM) were established. The task of organizing them was entrusted to the Fine Arts department of the People's Commissariat for Education, which was headed by representatives of the "leftists". For 15 years the Academy became the arena for an intense struggle over issues of the organization of artistic education and the development of Soviet art. On 12 April 1918 the Council of People's Commissars also adopted a decree "on the monuments of the republic" that has gone down in history as "Lenin’s decree on monumental propaganda". The decree called for the removal of memorials erected in honour of the tsars and their servants and the production of monuments to Russia's Socialist revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist.msu.ru/ER/Etext/DEKRET/18-04-12.htm Декрет СНК "О памятниках республики" от 12 апреля 1918 года]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the complications caused by the change of regime, the civil war and foreign intervention, artistic groupings – [[Mir iskusstva]], [[Peredvizhniki]] , the Arkhip Kuindzhi Society, the Commune of Artists, and the Society of Individualist Artists – continued to operate in Petrograd. In 1922 the Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia ([[AKhRR]]) was formed and the artist Nikolai Dormidontov became head of its Petrograd branch. Among the participants in exhibitions between 1917 and 1923 were such artists as [[Nathan Altman]], [[Mikhail Avilov]], [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Boris Grigoriev]], [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vladimir Makovsky]], [[Nikolay Nikanorovich Dubovskoy|Nikolay Dubovskoy]], [[Osip Braz]], [[Konstantin Makovsky]], [[Boris Kustodiev]], [[Sergey Konenkov]], George Savitsky, [[Mykola Samokysh]], [[Arkady Rylov]], [[Stanislav Zhukovsky]], Vladimir Kuznetsov, [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Alexandre Benois]], [[Vladimir Baranov-Rossine]], [[Pavel Filonov]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], [[Nicholas Roerich]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Mstislav Dobuzhinsky]], [[Alexander Kiselyov (painter)|Alexander Kiselyov]], [[Ivan Bilibin]], [[Zinaida Serebriakova]], [[Piotr Buchkin]], [[Yury Annenkov]], [[Rudolf Frentz]], [[Aleksandr Golovin (artist)|Aleksander Golovin]] and some others. Between them, they represented the main directions and tendencies in contemporary art. Some of them, such as [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Pavel Filonov]], [[Marc Chagall]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]] were figures of world rank.

Among the most significant works from this period critics name In the Azure Expanse (1918) by [[Arkady Rylov]], Celebration Marking the Opening of the 2nd Congress of the Comintern on Uritsky Square on 19 June 1920 (1921) by [[Boris Kustodiev]],&lt;ref&gt;В.

СПб: Palace Editions, 2000. С. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; These works testify to the multi-directional development of Petrograd's fine art, in which various tendencies, styles, and directions were represented by striking leaders.

Among the art exhibitions, the largest were the "First State Free Exhibition of Works of Art", held in the Winter Palace in 1919 with 300 participants, and the "Exhibition of Paintings by Petrograd Artists of All Directions. 1918–1923", held at the Academy of Arts in 1923 with 263 participants.&lt;ref&gt;Каталог выставки картин художников Петрограда всех направлений за пятилетний период деятельности. 1918-1923. Петроград: Академия художеств, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibitions were staged of paintings by members of the Kuindzhi Society, the Commune of Artists, [[Peredvizhniki]] and [[Mir iskusstva]], as well as the traditional autumn and spring exhibitions. The venues for them were the halls of the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, the Academy of Arts, the Museum of the City (the former Anichkov Palace) and the Hermitage. The year 1920 saw one-man exhibitions of [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]] and [[Mstislav Dobuzhinsky]].

In 1919 a Museum of Artistic Culture was formed in Petrograd and in 1923 the Institute of Artistic Culture (INKhUK) formed under its auspices, headed by [[David Shterenberg]]. 

In 1922 in Petrograd, on the basis of a private studio foundry, an artistic casting facility was established. Later it was transformed into the Monumentskuptura artistic casting works, which produced monumental art in bronze, granite and marble.

In this period a Leningrad school of graphic art formed. The cultural revolution created an active readership of many millions, presenting graphic art with new tasks. Petrograd artists became involved in the creation of illustrations for a series of books called "The People’s Library". The time produced publications that became the zenith of book art: Pushkin's Bronze Horseman with illustrations by [[Alexandre Benois]] and Dostoyevsky's White Nights featuring drawings by [[Mstislav Dobuzhinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Матафонов, В. С. Развитие ленинградской графики / Изобразительное искусство Ленинграда. Выставка произведений ленинградских художников. Л: Художник РСФСР, 1981. С. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; Posters as an art form acquired particular topicality and political incisiveness in this period. Notable examples are Nikolai Kochergin's works Everybody to the Defence of Petrograd! (1919) and It's Wrangel's Turn! (1920), as well as the posters known as the "ROSTA Windows". Drawings of Lenin made from life by the artists [[Nathan Altman]], [[Isaak Brodsky]], and [[Piotr Buchkin]] became the foundation for a whole genre of "Leniniana" in Soviet fine art.

An innovative line of work was the festive decoration of Petrograd for the early anniversaries of the October Revolution. Among the many people involved were the artists [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], [[Boris Kustodiev]], [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Arkady Rylov]], and [[Nathan Altman]], the sculptors [[Leonid Sherwood]] and Sarah Lebedeva, the graphic artists [[Vladimir Lebedev (painter)|Vladimir Lebedev]], [[Mstislav Dobuzhinsky]] and [[Sergey Chekhonin]], the architects [[Lev Rudnev]] and [[Ivan Fomin]]. Their ideas and approaches to a large extent determined the characteristics of the nascent new Soviet art of decorating public spaces that answered the call for monumental propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Немиро, О. В. Современное декоративно-оформительское искусство Ленинграда / Изобразительное искусство Ленинграда. Выставка произведений ленинградских художников. Л: Художник РСФСР, 1981. С. 457.&lt;/ref&gt;

World fame accrued to Petrograd applied art through the agitation porcelain produced by the [[Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg|State Porcelain Factory]] (previously the Imperial Porcelain Factory, later the Leningrad Lomonosov Porcelain Factory). The factory was found to have large stocks of unpainted items and the decision was taken to employ them not simply as tableware, but primarily as a vehicle of revolutionary propaganda. The inspiration and "spirit" of the factory's artistic activities was [[Sergey Chekhonin]], who became head of the painting department at the State Porcelain Factory in 1917. His very first works already had an agitation purpose, including the greatest of them – the anniversary dish produced for 25 October 1918 (the coat of arms of the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic worked in flowers). [[Sergey Chekhonin]] personally and others working from his drawings painted a large number of plates with slogans and the initials of the RSFSR, dishes, cups and whole services decorated with a pattern of many flowers and gilding. Besides the purely ornamental and allegorical pieces, the factory also produced from Sergey Chekhonin's drawings a series of graphic portraits of the leaders of the world proletariat as well as a large oval dish bearing the autographs of all the most prominent figures of the October Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Голлербах, Э. Государственный фарфоровый завод и художники // Русское искусство, № 2—3. Петроград, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists involved in the creation of agitation porcelain included М. М. Adamovich, N. I. Altman, Alexandra Chekotikhina—Pototskaya, Natalia Danko, [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], [[Pavel Kuznetsov]] and [[Mstislav Dobuzhinsky]].

== 1924–30 ==
[[File:Brodski lenin.jpg|thumb|left|400px|[[Isaak Brodsky]]&lt;br /&gt;Lenin in Smolny. 1930. [[Tretyakov Gallery]]]]

On 21 January 1924 Lenin died. On 26 January, by a resolution of the Second Congress of Soviets of the recently formed USSR, Petrograd was renamed Leningrad. For the fine arts in the city this event had more than merely formal consequences. As early as the summer of 1924 an exhibition was held at the Academy of Arts of competition entries for a monument to Lenin. First prize was awarded to a design by the architect [[Iosif Langbard]] in a revolutionary romantic style. On 7 November 1926, the ninth anniversary of the October Revolution, one of the most famous monuments to the Soviet leader was unveiled on the square by the Finland Railway Station (Lenin on the Armoured Car), sculptor Sergey Evseev, architects [[Vladimir Shchuko]] and [[Vladimir Gelfreykh]]. In 1925 a monument to the assassinated revolutionary V. Volodarsky (created by the sculptors [[Matvey Manizer]] and Lina Bleze-Manizer together with the architect Vladimir Vitman) was inaugurated, as was another to the pioneer Russian Marxist Georgy Plekhanov (sculptor Ilya Ginsburg) by the Technological Institute. In 1928 a monument to [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], also by Ginsburg, was set up, again near the Technological Institute. In 1925 a monument to Lenin by the Leningrad sculptor [[Vasily Kozlov (sculptor)|Vasily Kozlov]] (from 1919 chairman of the Petrograd committee of sculptors, later professor of the sculpture faculty of the Academy of Arts) was set up in the southern Russian city of Taganrog. In 1927 a monument to Lenin by the same sculptor was unveiled in front of the Smolny Institute, which had been the HQ of the October Revolution. These works established a sort of canon for subsequent depictions of Lenin in Soviet art.

The year 1925 was marked by a series of important events for the fine arts in Leningrad. The Institute of Artistic Culture (INKhUK) was converted into the State Institute of Artistic Culture (GINKhUK). Such prominent figures in "leftist" art as [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]] and [[Mikhail Matyushin]] were recruited to head its experimental workshops. That same year П. [[Pavel Filonov]] organized his own group – the "Masters of Analytical Art". Over the course of its existence more than 70 artists participated in its activities (Tatyana Glebova, Boris Gurvich, Sophia Zaklikovskaya, Eugene Kibryck, Pavel Kondratiev, Alise Poret, Andrew Sashin, Мikhail Tsibasov and many others). In 1927 and 1928, two exhibitions of the "Masters of Analytical Art" were held, in the House of the Press and the Academy of Arts.

In the spring of 1926, the art association called the "Circle of Artists" formed in Leningrad. Among its members who subsequently became prominent figures were [[Viacheslav Pakulin]], [[Alexei Pakhomov]], [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], Alise Poret, Alexander Rusakov, Vladimir Malagis, Nikolai Emelianov, Boris Kaplansky, Lev Britanishsky, Yacob Shur, Maria Fedoricheva, Alexander Vedernikov, Vasily Kuptsov, Gerta Nemenova, Мikhail Verbov, Alexey Pochtenny, Naum Mogilevsky, Piotr Osolodkov, George Traugot and Sergei Chugunov. The Circle declared its aim to be commitment to "the style of the epoch". It held three exhibitions in Leningrad, the most significant of them being considered to be the second exhibition of 1928, held in the [[Russian Museum]]. It featured around 150 works, mainly paintings. The exhibition functioned for a month and a half, evoking great interest and positive reviews in the press. It was visited by [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], the People's Commissar for Education.&lt;ref&gt;Герман, М. Ю. Александр Русаков. М: Советский художник, 1989. С. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other major exhibitions of the middle to late 1920s were the 8th exhibition of the [[AKhRR]] (Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia) "The Life and Daily Existence of the Peoples of the USSR" (1926, Russian Museum),&lt;ref&gt;VIII Выставка картин и скульптуры АХРР "Жизнь и быт народов СССР". Справочник-каталог с иллюстрациями. Л: АХРР, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; the "Exhibition of the Latest Tendencies in Art" (1927, Russian Museum, with participants including [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[David Burliuk]], [[Vladimir Tatlin]], [[Alexander Osmerkin]], [[Robert Falk]], [[Pyotr Konchalovsky]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Natalia Goncharova]] and [[Marc Chagall]]), the "Jubilee Exhibition of Fine Arts" (1927, Academy of Arts)&lt;ref&gt;Юбилейная выставка изобразительных искусств. 1917-Х-1927. Каталог. Л: 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Contemporary Leningrad Artistic Groupings" (1928, Russian Museum). There were also exhibitions of paintings by the Kuindzhi Society, the Commune of Artists, the Society of Individualist Artists and the "4 Arts" association of artists. Leningrad artists participated in a number of exhibitions in Moscow and abroad, including the "Exhibition of Works of Art for the Tenth Anniversary of the October Revolution" (1928, Moscow), the "Exhibition of Paintings by Moscow and Leningrad Artists organized to mark the 25th anniversary of the artistic and teaching activities of [[Dmitry Kardovsky]]" (1929, Moscow) and "Contemporary and Applied Art of Soviet Russia’ (1929, New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Detroit).

[[File:Death of a Commissar (Petrov-Vodkin).jpg|thumb|350px|[[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], &lt;br /&gt; Death Commissar. 1928. [[Russian Museum]]]]

Among the works of this period critics particularly single out the sculptural group October (1927) by [[Alexander Matveyev]] and the paintings Death of a Commissar (1928) and Earthquake in the Crimea (1928) by [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], Formula of Spring (1929) by [[Pavel Filonov]], Portrait of the Poet Mikhail Kuzmin (1925) by Nikolai Radlov, Lenin against the Background of the Kremlin (1924), Mikhail Frunze on Manoeuvres (1929), Lenin in Smolny (1930) and Lenin's Speech at a Meeting of the Workers of the Putilov Factory in May 1917 (1929) by [[Isaak Brodsky]], Forest River (1929) by [[Arkady Rylov]], Meeting of the Village Party Cell (1925) by Yefim Cheptsov, Weaving mill (1930) by [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], portraits of female workers by [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]] and [[Alexei Pakhomov]].&lt;ref&gt;Мочалов, Л. В. Некоторые проблемы развития ленинградского искусства / Изобразительное искусство Ленинграда. Выставка произведений ленинградских художников. Л: Художник РСФСР, 1981. С. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

The applied art of Leningrad in the 1920s was represented by the emblematic fabrics of the Vera Slutskaya Factory, works of the Decorative Institute attached to GINKhUK and, of course, the agitation porcelain. In 1925, at a World Exhibition of Industrial Art in Paris, visitors saw 1,000 examples of this art form and it brought the artists of Leningrad gold medals from the organizers and the recognition of foreign specialists. In these works, the new content of art became consolidated through exquisite painting. It was so significant that it completely overshadowed the utilitarian nature of the tableware basis. The content of this unprecedented art was revolutionary symbols, Soviet emblems, the themes of labour and daily life, lyrical fantasies, images inspired by Russian poetry and folklore, plant motifs and flowers as a symbol of the fresh springtime blossoming of nature and the renewal of life. The artists approached the treatment of these themes with great professional skill, erudition and taste. In the opinion of Natalia Taranovskaya, from a formal viewpoint this art represented "an astonishing amalgam of features of Russian Classicism, romantic and folk traditions, agitation and decorative art, Suprematism and industrial design".&lt;ref&gt;Тарановская, Н. В. Основные направления в развитии декоративно-прикладного искусства Ленинграда / Изобразительное искусство Ленинграда. Выставка произведений ленинградских художников. Л: Художник РСФСР, 1981. С. 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period the Leningrad graphic artists produced portraits of figures in the Communist and workers’ movement for reproduction with massive print-runs. In 1924 artist Аlfred Eberling won a competition for the best portrait of Lenin, after which he made a drawing for banknotes that was later reproduced on Soviet 1937-series currency. In the post-war years Eberling's drawing was used as a watermark on Soviet banknotes of the 1947 and 1957 series.
In the late 1920s a tendency towards the organizational consolidation of Leningrad's creative forces found expression in the creation of the "Zekh Khudozhnikov" in 1930 as a result of the merger of four bodies – the Kuindzhi Society, the Commune of Artists, the Society of Individualist Artists and the Society of Painters. Members’ works were shown at the Academy of Arts, at the "First Citywide Exhibition of Fine Arts", with [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], [[Mikhail Avilov]], [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Arkady Rylov]], [[Mikhail Bobyshov]], [[Boris Kustodiev]], [[Alexander Matveyev]], [[Alexei Pakhomov]], Alexander Vedernikov, [[Rudolf Frentz]] and others participating.

A great loss for Leningrad artists was the death in 1930 of [[Ilya Repin]], whose name was inseparably associated with the Academy of Arts and the fine art of St Petersburg–Petrograd–Leningrad. That event coincided with yet another reorganization of the academic institution undertaken in 1930, as a result of which the Leningrad VKhUTEIN was turned into the Institute of Proletarian Fine Art (INPII). The Moscow VKhUTEIN was united with the Leningrad institute and closed as an independent educational establishment. The man appointed as new rector of the institute was Fyodor Maslov, a former worker of the Chief Administration of Professional Education, whose name rapidly became firmly attached to a regime that saw not only further reformation of the institute, but also the effective destruction of its museum and the elimination of the department of easel painting and the architecture faculty. An advocate of the immediate "proletarianization" of art, Maslov explained the shutting down of the department of easel painting by asserting that "the easel painting has ceased to be a progressive form of fine art."&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School. Saint Petersburg, NP-Print Edition, 2007. P. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Students of painting and sculpture were tasked with acquiring simple methods that would enable them to go on to produce standard works on industrial themes. There was no mention of the study of the laws of composition and perspective, of mastering the secrets of drawing and painting technique. By Maslov's order of 14 May 1930, the museum of the Academy of Arts was completely abolished. Its stocks were transferred to the Russian Museum and Hermitage, as well as museums in Kharkov, Lvov, Krasnodar, Khabarovsk, Odessa, Dnepropetrovsk, Novgorod and Feodosia.

== The 1930s ==
[[File:Петров-Водкин - Черёмуха в стакане (1932).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]]&lt;br /&gt;Bird cherry in a glass. 1932. [[Russian Museum]]]]

Yet another reform of the Academy of Arts coincided with the heightened polemics in the early 1930s in the artistic milieu, where there were dozens of competing associations and groups of artists existing at the same time. Many of them, despite high-flown declarations, had no clear platform and were created with the sole purpose of providing their founders with means of subsistence. Others, such as the Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia ( [[AKhRR|AKhRR – AKhR]]) with its almost forty branches, on the contrary laid claim to ideological leadership of the entire artistic movement.
In the late 1920s, the purging of the AKhR of "bourgeois elements" resulted in the exclusion of the artists [[Mikhail Avilov]], [[Isaak Brodsky]] and Gavriil Gorelov. Later [[Abram Arkhipov]], [[Rudolf Frentz]], [[Piotr Buchkin]], [[Dmitry Kardovsky]], Nikolai Dormidontov and other major painters quit the AKhR. The "Brodsky’s Affair", which was dealt with by a special commission of the People's Commissariat for Education, attracted widespread attention. It revealed a picture of intrigues and embittered group fighting, reflecting the abnormal situation that had arisen within art.

Another event that aroused a public response was the scandalous 1931 exhibition in the [[Russian Museum]], which featured "black walls" hung with paintings that the exhibition organizers described as "seditious". Beneath each work there was a special label revealing its "bourgeois essence". In response, within the walls of the Academy of Arts and among Leningrad's artistic community opposition to this deleterious policy for art took shape, also producing resolute criticism of Maslov's regime.&lt;ref&gt;И. А. Бродский. Исаак Израилевич Бродский. М: Изобразительное искусство, 1973. С. 322—324.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1932, the Central Committee of the Communist Party adopted a resolution "On the reconstruction of literary and artistic organizations". The existing literary and artistic organizations were dissolved to be replaced by single creative unions of artists, writers, theatrical personnel and composers. On 2 August 1932, at a general meeting of Leningrad artists who were members of various societies, a single [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists|Leningrad Regional Union of Soviet Artists (LOSSKh)]] was formed. Painter [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]] was elected its first chairman. Soon, by resolution of the Leningrad City Soviet, LOSSKh was given the use of the historical building of the former Society for the Encouragement of the Arts at 38, Herzen Street (today once again Bolshaya Morskaya Street).&lt;ref&gt;Л. С. Конова. Санкт-Петербургский Союз художников. Краткая хроника 1932-2009 // Петербургские искусствоведческие тетради. Выпуск 16. СПб, 2009. С. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The city assumed all expenses for the removal of the existing tenants and the refurbishment of the building. The LOSSKh became the creative and professional body that for a period of 60 years united Leningrad artists of all sorts – painters, sculptors, graphic artists, monumental artists, specialists in decorative and applied art, film and theatrical designers and also art historians. The union organized creative, professional and exhibition activities and settled matters relating to the social welfare and material condition of artists. The [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists|LOSSKh]] filled its ranks by inducting the members of the dissolved artistic associations and groups, and later with graduates from the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (the former Academy of Arts) and other educational establishments in the city.

The first city-level exhibition of Leningrad artists after the formation of the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists|LOSSKh]] took place in 1935. The display included works by 146 painters, 59 sculptors, 66 graphic artists and 17 porcelain artists.&lt;ref&gt;А. Г. Раскин. Связь времён / Связь времён. Каталог выставки ЦВЗ "Манеж". СПб: 1997. С. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting section among a lot of participants were [[Rudolf Frentz]], [[Piotr Buchkin]], [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], [[Arkady Rylov]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], Nikolai Dormidontov, [[Mikhail Avilov]], Nikolai Tyrsa, Eugene Kibryck, [[Alexei Pakhomov]], Alexander Vedernikov, Yefim Cheptsov.&lt;ref&gt;Каталог первой выставки ленинградских художников. Л: ГРМ, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; Those artists, in the opinion of Valeria Ushakova, drew in their work above all "on the best traditions of the Russian realist school that later came to be called the [[Leningrad School of Painting|Leningrad School]]".&lt;ref&gt;В.

[[File:Автопортрет. Художник. 1933. ГРМ.png|thumb|left|300px|[[Kazimir Malevich]]&lt;br /&gt;Self-Portrait. 1933. [[Russian Museum]]]]

Other major exhibitions were "Soviet Fine Art of the Reconstructive Period" (1932), "Artists of the RSFSR over 15 years" (1932), "15 Years of the Red Army" (1933), "Woman in Socialist Construction" (1934), all four held in the Russian Museum, "Leningrad in Depictions by Contemporary Artists" (1934, Museum of the City), "An Exhibition of Paintings by Leningrad Artists" (1935, Vsekokhudozhnik, Moscow) and "The Jubilee Exhibition dedicated the 175th Anniversary of the formation of the Russian Academy of Arts" (1939, Academy of Arts). Exhibitions were regularly held in the LOSSKh – Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists (named LSSKh since 1937), as were exhibitions of the graduation pieces of the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. Particularly notable among the solo exhibitions were retrospectives of [[Isaak Brodsky]] (1934, Moscow, Leningrad), [[Arkady Rylov]] (1934, Academy of Arts), [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]] (1936, Moscow, Leningrad), [[Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva]] (1940, Russian Museum) and personal exhibitions in the LSSKh of [[Vladimir Konashevich]], [[Dmitry Mitrohin]], [[Mikhail Avilov]], Alexander Vedernikov, [[Nathan Altman]], Pavel Basmanov, [[Aleksandr Golovin (artist)|Aleksander Golovin]], [[Elizaveta Kruglikova]], Victor Zamiraylo, Ivan Drozdov, Leonid Ovsannikov and others.&lt;ref&gt;Л. С. Конова. Санкт-Петербургский Союз художников. Краткая хроника 1932-2009 // Петербургские искусствоведческие тетради. Выпуск 16. СПб, 2009. С. 73—74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1932 the All-Union Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars adopted a resolution "On the creation of the Academy of Arts" The Leningrad Institute of Proletarian Fine Art was transformed into the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]] (LIZhSA) and a line was drawn under a 15-year period of continuous transformation of that educational establishment. Still it required a few more years to gather the scattered teaching forces and construct artistic education anew. This process was begun by the Academy's new director, the sculptor [[Alexander Matveyev]], and his deputy for educational work, Professor of Painting [[Alexander Savinov]]. They invited [[Dmitry Kardovsky]], [[Alexander Osmerkin]], [[Semion Abugov]], [[Eugene Lanceray]], Pavel Shillingovsky, [[Isaak Brodsky]], and Nikolai Radlov to join the faculty and between them those professors did much to revive the Academy's role in training art specialists.

In 1934 [[Isaak Brodsky]], a pupil of [[Ilya Repin]], was appointed director of the institute and of the All-Russian Academy of Arts (VAKh). [[Isaak Brodsky|Brodsky]] enlisted to teach at the institute some major artists and educators: [[Konstantin Yuon]], Pavel Naumov, [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Alexander Lubimov]], [[Rudolf Frentz]], [[Piotr Buchkin]], Nikolai Petrov, Victor Sinaysky, Vasily Shukhaev, Dmitry Kiplik, [[Nikolay Punin]], Vasily Meshkov, [[Mikhail Bernshtein]], Yefim Cheptsov, [[Ivan Bilibin]], [[Matvey Manizer]], [[Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva]], Alexei Karev, Leonid Ovsannikov, Sergei Priselkov, Ivan Stepashkin, Konstantin Rudakov and more. Training for the future artists was founded upon mastery of drawing, composition and painting, as well as a study of the history of art. The system of individual creative studios in which students continued their education after the second year was reinstated. In the painting faculty the studios were headed by [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Boris Ioganson]], Vasily Yakovlev, [[Dmitry Kardovsky]], [[Alexander Osmerkin]], [[Alexander Savinov]], [[Rudolf Frentz]], Pavel Shillingovsky and [[Mikhail Bobyshov]].

In the late 1930s the first graduates of the revitalized Academy were the artists [[Yuri Neprintsev]], [[Piotr Belousov]], [[Nikolai Timkov]], [[Aleksei Gritsai]], Мikhail Zheleznov, [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Aleksandr Laktionov]], [[Piotr Vasiliev]], Аnatoli Yar-Kravchenko, [[Mikhail Kozell]] (studio of [[Isaak Brodsky]]), Dmitry Mochalsky, Alexander Debler, Ludmila Ronchevskaya, [[Mariam Aslamazian]], Ivan Kalashnikov, Nikolai Andriako (studio of [[Alexander Savinov]]), [[Gleb Savinov]], [[Elena Skuin]], Zalman Zaltsman, Тimofey Ksenofontov, [[Olga Bogaevskaya]] and [[Evgenia Baykova]] (studio of [[Alexander Osmerkin]]). Many of them became not only eminent painters, but also educators, who taught more than one generation of young artists.

One of the consequences of the consolidation of creative forces and the reform of the Academy was a strengthening of the role of easel and monumental painting and, particularly, the thematic picture among the other types and genres of Leningrad art. Such works firmly occupied a central place at exhibitions. Among the creations of Leningrad artists in the 1930s, critics single out the paintings Girl in a Sport Shirt (1932), Woman - metro's builder with a drill  (1937), The Komsomol on a War Footing (1933), Sergei Kirov Taking a Parade of Athletes (1935) and Female Delegates (1939) by [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], Bird cherry in a glass (1932) and Alarm (1934) by [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]],  Portrait of the Artist Tatyana Shishmareva  (1934) by Vladimir Lebedev,  In Green Banks (1938) by [[Arkady Rylov]], Nude (1937) by Nikolai Tyrsa, Portrait of Maxim Gorky (1937) by [[Isaak Brodsky]], Self-Portrait (1933) by [[Kazimir Malevich]], Red Army Men Producing a Wall Newspaper&lt;ref&gt;Двести лет Академии художеств СССР. Каталог выставки. Л—М: 1958. С. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; (1938) by [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Aleksandr Laktionov]], Shock Workers (1935) by [[Pavel Filonov]], and the urban landscapes of Vladimir Grinberg, Nikolai Lapshin and Alexander Vedernikov.

The most famous works by Leningrad sculptors include the monument to Kirov in Leningrad (1938) created by [[Nikolai Tomsky]], the sculptural composition Lenin in Razliv (1935) by Veniamin Pinchuk, monuments of Lenin in Petrozavodsk (1933), Minsk (1933) and Ulyanovsk (1940), to Chapayev in Samara (1932), and to Taras Shevchenko in Kharkov (1935) and Kiev (1938) by [[Matvey Manizer]], and the same sculptor's monument to the victims of 9 January 1905 in Leningrad (1931).

In the mid-1930s in Leningrad a unique system of elementary and secondary art education for children took shape in Leningrad. In 1934 a School of Young Talents was organized under the auspices of the Academy of Arts, which was soon transformed into the [[Leningrad Secondary Art School|''Secondary Art School'']] (SKhSh) attached to the Academy of Arts. It was also given a boarding section. Among the school's alumni in the pre-war years were the future distinguished Leningrad artists and sculptors [[Alexei Eriomin]], [[Vecheslav Zagonek]], [[Mikhail Anikushin]], Nikolai Kochukov, Iya Venkova, [[Evgenia Antipova]], [[Anatoli Levitin]], [[Yuri Tulin]], [[Dmitry Buchkin]], [[Vladimir Chekalov]], [[Marina Kozlovskaya]], [[Elena Kostenko]], [[Abram Grushko]], [[Oleg Lomakin]], Vera Lubimova and many others. Children's art schools and studios appeared attached to Leningrad's Palace of Pioneers and in the majority of the city's districts. Besides drawing they taught the basics of painting, composition and the history of the arts. The lessons were given by professional artists, some of them graduates of the Academy.

In the 1930s the development of fine art and artistic education was accompanied by arguments and debates about the course and methods of training young artists, about genres, about the attitude to tendencies in European art and about the method of Socialist Realism. These discussions, into which young artists also became drawn, furthered the revelation of creative personalities and were an important factor in the formation of Leningrad art.
The successes of Leningrad artists in the field of book and easel graphic art were due to the works of George Vereysky, Nikolau Radlov, Pavel Basmanov, [[Vladimir Konashevich]], Nikolai Tyrsa, [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], Eugene Kibryck, [[Alexei Pakhomov]], Vladimir Lebedev, Аnna Ostroumova-Lebedeva, Pavel Shillingovsky, Yuri Vasnetsov, Eugene Charushin, Кonstantin Rudakov, Gennady Epifanov, Sergei Mochalov, [[Ivan Bilibin]] and others. [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov's]] illustrations for Saltykov-Shchedrin's novel The History of a Town were awarded the grand prix at the 1937 Paris Exposition. At that same event a gold medal was awarded to [[Vladimir Konashevich|Vladimir Konashevich's]] illustrations for Abbé Prévost's novella Manon Lescaut. Among the notable achievements of Soviet graphic art in this period are Кonstantin Rudakov's illustrations for Maupassant's Bel Ami and Eugene Kibryck's illustrations for Romain Rolland's Colas Breugnon and Charles de Coster's Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel.&lt;ref&gt;Матафонов, В. С. Развитие ленинградской графики / Изобразительное искусство Ленинграда. Выставка произведений ленинградских художников. Л: Художник РСФСР, 1981. С. 433.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 a team of artists called the "Boyevoy karandash" ("Fighting Pencil") was formed within the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists|LSSKh]]. Its initial members were the graphic artists Ivan Astapov, Orest Vireysky, Valentin Kirdov, Vladimir Galba, Nikolai Muratov and Boris Semionov. A first collective poster was issued on the subject of the [[Winter War]] against Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Л. С. Конова. Санкт-Петербургский Союз художников. Краткая хроника 1932-2009 // Петербургские искусствоведческие тетради. Выпуск 16. СПб, 2009. С. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
The immediate pre-war Leningrad exhibitions of 1940–41, in Abram Raskin's opinion, refute assertions that the output of Leningrad's artists was completely subordinated to political dictate and crushed by ideological pressure. In many works of landscape, portrait and study painting, purely artistic tasks were set and successfully accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;Раскин, А. Г. Связь времён / Связь времён. Каталог выставки ЦВЗ "Манеж". СПб: 1997. С. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The War and Siege ==

In the years of the [[Great Patriotic War|Great Patriotic War of 1941–1945]], Leningrad fine art was quite literally "in the front line of the fight against the enemy".&lt;ref&gt;Мочалов, Л. В. Некоторые проблемы развития ленинградского искусства / Изобразительное искусство Ленинграда. Выставка произведений ленинградских художников. Л: Художник РСФСР, 1981. С. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; In the very first days following the Nazi invasion on 22 June 1941, artists joined in preparing more than a million exhibits from the stocks of the Hermitage and Russian Museum for evacuation. The first train carrying them left for the East on 1 July. An even greater quantity of museum items were moved into temporary storage places. Tremendous work was carried out to protect and camouflage sculptural monuments, military, civic and industrial objects. The production of posters and wartime leaflets began. Artists participated in the construction of defensive installations and served in air raid defence units. Publication of the "Boyevoy karandash" ("Fighting Pencil") was resumed. As early as 24 June Vladimir Serov's poster We Have Beaten, Are Beating and Will Beat! appeared on the streets of Leningrad and in the window of the former Yeliseyev Shop on Nevsky Prospekt the first issue of the "TASS Windows" was put on display.&lt;ref&gt;Блокадный дневник. Живопись и графика блокадного времени. СПб: 2005. С. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In all, during the war years the "Fighting Pencil" produced 103 posters with print-runs between 3,000 and 15,000 copies, executed in the traditions of the lubok popular print, politically sharp and inventive.&lt;ref&gt;В.

[[File:Serebrany-AIC-chu26b.jpg|thumb|left|400px|[[Joseph Serebriany]]&lt;br /&gt; The partisan detachment. Lesgaftovtsy. 1942. [[Russian Museum]]]]

In the very hardest months of the siege, to preserve their lives a proportion of the artists were placed under barracks conditions in the Academy and in the premises of the Artists’ Union at 38, Herzen Street. In December 1941, 38 students presented diploma works at the Academy, some of them being temporarily recalled from the front to do so. In February 1942 staff and students of the Academy and Secondary School of Art were evacuated to Samarkand, where the educational process continued. The institute returned from evacuation on 18 July 1944, while on 14 July it was given the name of [[Ilya Repin]] by resolution of the government of the USSR.

During the war close to every third member of the LOSSKh perished. Authors differ on the exact numbers. Olga Roitenberg, for example, writes about 550 lives lost to the war and the siege, while admitting that this sad figure is far from definitive.&lt;ref&gt;О. Ройтенберг. Они погибли на войне // Искусство. 1985, № 5. С. 19—26.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the dead were [[Alexander Savinov]], [[Pavel Filonov]], Pavel Shillingovsky, [[Ivan Bilibin]], Nikolai Lapshin, Vladimir Grinberg, Nikolai Tyrsa and Alexei Karev. Even more devastating were the losses among young artists and students. Yet the Artists’ Union was gaining new members, among them the young [[Nikolai Timkov]], [[Sergei Ivanovich Osipov|Sergei Osipov]], [[Evgenia Baykova]], [[Gleb Savinov]], Nikolai Pilshikov and other Leningrad painters and graphic artists who would become well known in future.

It is symbolic that in October 1943 medal number one [[Medal "For the Defence of Leningrad"]] was awarded to the Academy of Arts student Nikolai Pilshikov (1914–1983), who entered the war as an air force pilot. While he flew missions on a par with others, from the first weeks of the war his gifted portrait sketches of the defenders of Leningrad's skies became widely known in the city. Later postcards were made of his works and in early 1942 the Iskusstvo publishing house put out an album of Pilshikov's portraits of celebrated air aces. It was presented along with Hero of the Soviet Union certificates to servicemen on the Leningrad front. The gallery of heroes that the artist created is of great historical and artistic value. They include the pilot Piotr Kharitonov, who was one of the first in the war to be awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, Timur Frunze, the son of a Civil War hero, the famous female pilot [[Valentina Grizodubova]], twice Hero of the Soviet Union Piotr Pokryshev and the defender of the "Road of Life" Alexei Sevastyanov. In 1942, on the recommendation of George Vereysky and Аnna Ostroumova-Lebedeva, Nikolai Pilshikovwas accepted into the LSSKh.&lt;ref&gt;Дюженко, Ю. Медаль номер один "За оборону Ленинграда" // Искусство. 1985, № 5. С. 24—27.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war and siege, exhibition activity continued in Leningrad. Such events bolstered the morale of the inhabitants and defenders of the beleaguered city and inspired confidence in victory over the enemy. On 2 January 1942, "in the most terrible winter of the siege, when the building was frozen to its foundations and the walls were covered with rime",&lt;ref&gt;Ушакова, В. А. Прошлое и настоящие Ленинградского — Санкт-Петербургского Союз художников // Художники — городу. Выставка к 70-летию Санкт-Петербургского Союза художников. СПб: Петрополь, 2003. С. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; the "First Exhibition of Works by Leningrad Artists during the Great Patriotic War" opened in the Artists’ Union and was later shown in the [[Pushkin Museum]] in [[Moscow]]. It featured works by 84 artists, including [[Ivan Bilibin]], Vladimir Grinberg, Vera Isaeva, Аnatoli Kazantsev, [[Yaroslav Nikolaev]], Veniamin Pinchuk, Vecheslav Pakulin, Victor Proshkin, Varvara Raevskaya-Rutkovskaya, Nikolai Rutkovsky, [[Joseph Serebriany]], Vladimir Serov and Nikolai Tyrsa, that became historical evidence of the era and of the indomitable will of Leningraders.&lt;ref&gt;Ушакова, В. А. Прошлое и настоящие Ленинградского — Санкт-Петербургского Союз художников // Художники — городу. Выставка к 70-летию Санкт-Петербургского Союза художников. СПб: Петрополь, 2003. С. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later there were three exhibitions of artists of the Leningrad front (1943–45, Russian Museum, Academy of Arts) and the exhibitions "In the Battles for Leningrad" (1942, House of the Red Army), "25 Years of the Red Army" (1943, House of the Red Army),&lt;ref&gt;Конова, Л. С. Санкт—Петербургский Союз художников. Краткая хроника 1932—2009 // Петербургские искусствоведческие тетради. Вып. 16. СПб: 2009. С. 75—77.&lt;/ref&gt; the spring exhibition (1943, LSSKh), the "Exhibition of Five" (1944, Russian Museum), "Exhibition of studies" (1945, LSSKh) and personal shows by [[Samuil Nevelshtein]], Leonid Ovsannikov, [[Vladimir Konashevich]], Piotr Lugansky and others. The largest wartime exhibition, devoted to "The Heroic Defence of Leningrad", opened on 30 April 1944 in Solyany Lane and gave the start to the legendary Museum of the Defence of Leningrad. Then in February 1945, in the same place, on the basis of the former Baron Stieglitz College of Technical Drawing, the Leningrad College of Art and Industry was opened, which soon turned into the [[Vera Mukhina Institute|Mukhina Higher College of Art and Industry]]. The college embarked on the training of specialist artists to restore the palace and park ensembles of Leningrad and its suburbs destroyed in the war.
Among the works created by Leningrad artists during the war, critics particularly note the paintings Self-Portrait (1942) and To the Outside World (1945) by [[Yaroslav Nikolaev]], Partisan Detachment. Lesgaft Institute Skiers (1942) by [[Joseph Serebriany]], An Urgent Order for the Front (1942) by Nikolai Dormidontov, The Duel on Kulikovo Field (1943) by [[Mikhail Avilov]],&lt;ref&gt;Живопись первой половины ХХ века (А—В) / Государственный Русский музей. СПб: Palace Editions, 1997. С. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The Breach of the Siege of Leningrad on 18 January 1943 (1943) by Аnatoli Kazantsev, [[Joseph Serebriany]], and Vladimir Serov,&lt;ref&gt;Живопись первой половины ХХ века (К) / Альманах. Вып. 226. СПб: Palace Editions, 2008. С. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Timkov|Nikolai Timkov's]] Leningrad under Siege series of landscapes (1942–44), series of graphic works by [[Alexei Pakhomov]] and Solomon Yudovin, and other works.
The war had an enormous impact on Soviet society and its fine art, determining many important aspects of its development for decades to come. That period also engendered a special attitude to Leningrad and Leningraders. People constantly expected something significant and profound from Leningrad artists, some particularly honest civic position, something for others to live up to. The exceptional character of the military and human drama that the city experienced had its effect on the work of Leningrad artists, who were destined to write a special chapter in the post-war history of fine art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradartist.com/war-and-leningrad-school_r.html Иванов, С. В. Великая Отечественная война и становление ленинградской школы живописи]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1946–1960 ==

The make-up of the Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists [[Leningrad Union of Artists|(LSSKh)]] and of participants in post-war Leningrad exhibitions was substantially rejuvenated by [[Repin Institute of Arts|LIZhSA]] graduates of the pre-war years, as well as those who were only now able to complete studies interrupted by the war. They were [[Mikhail Anikushin]], Nukolai Andretsov, [[Taisia Afonina]], [[Evgenia Baykova]], Konstantin Belokurov, [[Piotr Belousov]], [[Olga Bogaevskaya]], [[Anatoli Vasiliev]], [[Nina Veselova]], [[Igor Veselkin]], [[Rostislav Vovkushevsky]], [[Ivan Godlevsky]], Мeta Drayfild, Alexander Dashkevich, [[Yuri Neprintsev]], [[Gleb Savinov]], [[Nikolai Timkov]], Vasily Sokolov, [[Sergei Ivanovich Osipov|Sergei Osipov]], [[Mikhail Natarevich]], [[Evsey Moiseenko]], [[Andrei Mylnikov]], [[Genrikh Pavlovsky]], [[Lia Ostrova]], Мikhail Zheleznov, [[Lev Orekhov]], [[Alexei Eriomin]], [[Elena Skuin]], Yuri Podlasky, [[Tatiana Kopnina]], Nikita Medovikov, [[Victor Teterin]], [[Nikolai Mukho]], [[Alexander Pushnin]], [[Evgenia Antipova]], [[Alexei Mozhaev]], [[Nadezhda Shteinmiller]], [[Arseny Semionov]], [[Alexander Koroviakov]], Valery Pimenov, [[Maria Rudnitskaya]], [[Yuri Tulin]], [[Nikolai Brandt]], [[Semion Rotnitsky]], and many others. From that time on they were destined to become the vanguard of Leningrad art.

[[File:Neprintsev-Yuri-The-Rest-after-battle-bw.jpg|thumb|left|400px|[[Yuri Neprintsev]]&lt;br /&gt;Rest after Battle. 1951. [[Tretyakov Gallery]]]]

In the 1950s the [[Leningrad Union of Artists|(LSSKh)]] took in a large contingent of artists who had not begun their studies until after the war, including front-line veterans, who were permitted to enter the institute without examinations. This new influx included [[Leonid Baykov]], [[Nikolai Baskakov (painter)|Nikolai Baskakov]], [[Dmitry Belyaev (artist)|Dmitry Belyaev]], Sergei Buzulukov, [[Nikolai Galakhov]], [[Abram Grushko]], [[Vecheslav Zagonek]], [[Alexei Eriomin]], [[Boris Korneev]], [[Marina Kozlovskaya]], [[Elena Kostenko]], Anna Kostina, [[Yaroslav Krestovsky]], [[Valeria Larina]], [[Anatoli Levitin]], [[Boris Lavrenko]], [[Ivan Lavsky]], [[Piotr Litvinsky]], [[Oleg Lomakin]], [[Mikhail Kaneev]], [[Yuri Khukhrov]], [[Maya Kopitseva]], [[Engels Kozlov]], Edvard Virzhikovsky, Leonid Kabachek, [[Eugene Maltsev]], Konstantin Molteninov, [[Anatoli Nenartovich]], Avenir Parkhomenko, George Pesis, Vsevolod Petrov-Maslakov, [[Nikolai Pozdneev]], Igor Razdrogin, Victor Reykhet, [[Vladimir Sakson]], [[Vladimir Seleznev]], Vladimir Tokarev, [[Mikhail Trufanov]], [[Boris Ugarov]], Leonid Fokin, Piotr Fomin, [[Vladimir Chekalov]], and many others. While continuing to work on the narrative-directorial side of painting, they began to make more active use of the specific devices of their own art form, above all colour and plasticity. Orientation on the Itinerants was increasingly supplemented by an interest in such figures as [[Konstantin Korovin]], [[Valentin Serov]] and the members of the Union of Russian Artists with their culture of plein-air painting and studies from life.

Works from 1945–49, including some diploma pieces by Academy graduates, saw the first real successes in artistically generalizing the theme of the great feat accomplished by the entire nation in the war. Among them were In Memory of the Heroes of the Baltic Fleet (1946) by [[Andrei Mylnikov]], The Girls of the Donbass (1946) by [[Taisia Afonina]], The Road of Life (1946) by Alexei Kuznetsov, German Prisoners (1946) by Piotr Puko, The Victors (1947) by Franz Zaborovsky, A Wounded Commander (1947) by [[Alexander Koroviakov]], General Dovator (1947) by [[Evsey Moiseenko]], Landing Force (1947) by Elena Tabakova and Liberated Kishinev (1947) by [[Stepan Privedentsev]]. In [[Zagorsk]] in 1947, [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Aleksandr Laktionov]], a graduate of [[Isaak Brodsky|Isaak Brodsky's]] studio, completed the painting Letter from the Front ([[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[USSR State Prize|Stalin Prize]] 1st class for 1948) that has gone down in the history of the nation's art as an astonishingly bright image of the Victory, so desired and close. In 1951 another of [[Isaak Brodsky|Isaak Brodsky's]] pupils, [[Yuri Neprintsev]], produced the no less famous work Rest after Battle ([[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[USSR State Prize|Stalin Prize]] 1st class for 1952) in which the idea of the spiritual unity of the nation in the years of wartime trials is ably conveyed through the means of painting.

The theme of post-war reconstruction found reflection in the paintings In the Peaceful Fields (1950, [[Russian Museum]], [[USSR State Prize|Stalin Prize]] 3rd class for 1951) by [[Andrei Mylnikov]], Rebirth (1950) by [[Mikhail Natarevich]], Portrait of the Composer Solovyev-Sedoi (1950) by [[Joseph Serebriany]], Leningrad to the Builders of Communism. In the Hydro-Turbine Shop of the Stalin Works (1951) by [[Nina Veselova]], [[Vecheslav Zagonek]], [[Alexander Pushnin]], Yefim Rubin and [[Yuri Tulin]], Here the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station Will Be (1951) by [[Nikolai Galakhov]], Two Great Building Projects. A Meeting of the Scientific and Technical Board of the Elektrosila Works (1951) by [[Leonid Tkachenko (artist)|Leonid Tkachenko]], An Exchange of Stakhanovite Experience (1951) by [[Anatoli Levitin]], and Collective Farm Spring (1951) by [[Boris Ugarov]].

The artists shared the same interests and problems as the people. They strove to make their contribution to the general efforts, not to stand apart. This is indicated by the discussions and deliberations that took place in 1945–1947 in the Leningrad Artists’ Union. They raised pressing issues of the artistic standard of works and the provision of commissions, studios, and art materials.&lt;ref&gt;Стенографический отчёт выступления искусствоведа Н. Н. Пунина на обсуждении выставки этюда. 11 Февраля 1945 года // Центральный Государственный Архив литературы и искусства. СПб: Ф.78. Оп.1.

СПб: Ф.78. Оп.1. Д.99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the contracted works of painters and sculptors, a significant place was occupied by the historical revolutionary theme. Examples include Lenin among the Delegates of the 3rd Congress of the Komsomol (1949) and We Shall Take a Different Course (1951) by [[Piotr Belousov]], Stalin and Lenin in Razliv (1950) by [[Yaroslav Nikolaev]], Messengers with Lenin (1950) by Vladimir Serov, Stalin and Voroshilov on the Tsaritsyn Front (1950) by [[Rudolf Frentz]],&lt;ref&gt;Художественная выставка 1950 года.

At the same time, the facts demonstrate that the role of works belonging to this genre was not dominant in the fine art of the 1950s. For example, of the 177 works by Leningrad painters presented at the [[All-Union art exhibition (Moscow, 1957)|All-Union Art Exhibition marking the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution]] (Moscow, 1957) only ten were devoted to the Lenin theme (5.5%). For comparison, eight paintings were still lifes, while 61 (34%) were landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;[[All-Union art exhibition (Moscow, 1957)|Всесоюзная художественная выставка, посвящённая 40-летию Великой Октябрьской социалистической революции.

[[File:Spring Day.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Nikolai Pozdneev]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Spring Day (painting)|Spring Day]]. 1959.]]

Among the most significant achievements of Leningrad artists in this period, critics name the paintings Furnaceman (1955) by [[Mikhail Trufanov]], The Lena. 1912 (1957) by [[Yuri Tulin]], Campfires (1957) by Vasily Sokolov, University Embankment (1957) by [[Gleb Savinov]], The First Cavalry Army (1957) by [[Evsey Moiseenko]], A Warm Day (1957) by [[Anatoli Levitin]], Portrait of the Collective Farm Chairman M. Dolgov (1959) by [[Nina Veselova]], Morning (1960) by [[Vecheslav Zagonek]], The Opening Up of the North (1960) by [[Boris Korneev]], They Were Beginning the Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station (1960) by Yuri Podlasky, In the Leningrad Philharmonia. 1942 (1959) Portrait of F. Bezuglov, Smelter of the Krasny Vyborzhets Works (1960) by [[Joseph Serebriany]], and Holiday in Voronovo (1960) by [[Nina Veselova]] and Leonid Kabachek. They giftedly embody the image of contemporaries in the era of Khrushchev's "thaw" with its conceptions about the revolution, the past and present, with the tremendous scale of construction projects and the achievements of Soviet science and technology.
In this period a number of landscape painters positively attracted the public's attention, including [[Vladimir Ivanovich Ovchinnikov|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]], [[Nikolai Timkov]], [[Sergei Ivanovich Osipov|Sergei Osipov]], George Tatarnikov, [[Dmitry Maevsky]], [[Vecheslav Zagonek]], [[Nikolai Galakhov]], Alexander Guliaev and [[Vsevolod Bazhenov]]. In their work panoramic landscapes traditional for Russian painting became popular. And although in the first post-war decade many artists continued to evolve in a direction marked out in their student days, their efforts to vary the painterly-plastic devices used to produce an image became ever more obvious. The circle of traditions that Leningrad artists were drawing upon grew wider. Edging out the historical painting, there was a rapid upsurge in this period in portraiture, the still life and genre pieces, while the study was reinstated in its rights. As a result, such talented painters as [[Evgenia Antipova]], Vladimir Tokarev, [[Lev Russov]], [[Oleg Lomakin]], [[Mikhail Trufanov]], [[Boris Korneev]], [[Arseny Semionov]], [[Victor Teterin]], [[Elena Skuin]], [[Gevork Kotiantz]], and [[Maya Kopitseva]] were able to realize themselves in those genres. Their work became a noticeable phenomenon in painting in the 1960s–80s, substantially enriching it in terms of genre and style.

In 1946–1952 the fine arts in Leningrad experienced first-hand the consequences of the Communist Party Central Committee's resolution on the magazines Zvezda and Leningrad and the "Leningrad Affair". Crude attempts at administrative intervention and savage repressions had a painful effect on the artistic intelligentsia. Professor [[Alexander Osmerkin]] was dismissed as head of a studio at the [[Repin Institute of Arts|LIZhSA]]. The art scholar [[Nikolay Punin]] was removed from his post and sent to the Gulag, where he soon died. Everything connected with the heroic defence of Leningrad came under a taboo. The museum of the defence, filled with the works of artists and, in essence, created by them, was closed. Art, including the fine arts, was subjected to senseless regulation. This went on until 1954, when the political intrigue against Leningrad was exposed and the innocent victims were rehabilitated.&lt;ref&gt;Раскин, А. Г. Связь времён / Связь времён. Каталог выставки ЦВЗ "Манеж". СПб: 1997. С. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1957 the membership of the [[Leningrad Union of Artists|LSSKh]] was three times the pre-war figure. The annual exhibitions of Leningrad artists that were held in the halls of the [[Leningrad Union of Artists|LSSKh]] and the [[Russian Museum]] had up to 600 participants. Among the largest were the "Summary Exhibition of Works by Leningrad Artists" (1948, [[Leningrad Union of Artists|LSSKh]] ), the "Summary Exhibition of Works of Painting, Sculpture and Graphic Art for 1947–48" (1949, [[Leningrad Union of Artists|LSSKh]]), the "Exhibition of Works by Leningrad Artists Marking the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution" (1957, [[Russian Museum]]), the autumn exhibitions of 1956 and 1958 in the [[Leningrad Union of Artists|LSSKh]] and the "200 Years of the USSR Academy of Arts" exhibition (1957, Academy of Arts). Major events were the personal exhibitions of [[Mikhail Bobyshov]] (1952), [[Victor Oreshnikov]] (1955), [[Alexander Savinov]] (1956), [[Nikolai Timkov]], Alexander Rusakov, Мikhail Platunov (all in 1957), [[Yaroslav Nikolaev]] and [[Piotr Belousov]]  (1958). Leningrad art was strongly represented at the leading exhibitions in Moscow, including the [[All-Union art exhibition (Moscow, 1957)|All-Union Jubilee Exhibition of 1957]], the exhibitions "40 Years of the Soviet Armed Forces" and "40 Years of the Komsomol" in 1958, as well as the first republican exhibition [[Soviet Russia (exhibition, 1960)|"Soviet Russia"]]  in 1960.

Leningrad artists made a major contribution to the preparation and work of the first All-Union Congress of Soviet Artists in Moscow in 1957 and to the foundation of the Artists’ Union of Russia in 1960. That same year the [[Leningrad Union of Artists|LSSKh]] was transformed into the Leningrad branch of the Artists’ Union of the RSFSR (LOSKh RSFSR). In 1958 the Khudozknik RSFSR ("Artist of the RSFSR") publishing house was formed in Leningrad. Construction of fixed studios and housing for artists was expanded.

The greatest achievements of Leningrad sculptors were the monument to Pushkin on the Square of Arts (1957, sculptor [[Mikhail Anikushin]]), the memorial ensemble at the [[Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery|Piskarevskoye Cemetery]] (1960, sculptors Vera Isaeva, Boris Kapliansky, Аbram Malakhin, Мikhail Whyman, Robert Taurit, Maria Kharlamova and architects Eugene Levinson, Alexander Vasiliev)&lt;ref&gt;Бродский, И. А. Памятник героическим защитникам Ленинграда. Пискарёвское мемориальное кладбище-музей. Л: Художник РСФСР, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; and the monument to [[Alexander Griboyedov]] (1959, sculptor Vsevolod Lishev).

The 1950s Leningrad school of artistic glass is associated with the Leningrad Artistic Glassworks that opened in 1948, works by glass artists at the [[Vera Mukhina Institute|Mukhina Higher College]] and the pioneering creations of Boris Smirnov.&lt;ref&gt;Василевская, Н.

A substantial contribution to the country's decorative and applied art was made by the porcelain services and vases of Alexei Vorobievsky and Ivan Riznich, the table services of Аlexandra Schekotikhina-Pototskaya and the works of Аnna Leporskaya, Мikhail Mokh, Serafima Yakovleva, Vladimir Semionov, and Vladimir Gorodetsky. Fabrics produced by the Slutskaya factory became popular.&lt;ref&gt;Тарановская, Н. В.

The main creative forces in Leningrad fine art were concentrated in the city's branch of the Artists’ Union ([[Leningrad Union of Artists|LOSKh]]). By the late 1980s it united more than 3,000 professional artists in various fields – painters, sculptors, graphic artists and specialists in decorative and applied art. There were separate sections for monumental artists, artistic photographers and artist-restorers. Another large group of artists was brought together by the Combine of Painting and Design Art (KZhOI) and other production subdivisions of the Leningrad branch of the Art Fund of the RSFSR. Amateur artists came together around the fine arts studios that existed in all districts of the city, based primarily in Houses and Palaces of Culture and clubs. The links of this system interacted, not only providing broad involvement in fine arts activities, but also serving as route of entry into the profession for the most creatively gifted young people.

From the early 1960s artists’ living and working conditions changed substantially. Official purchases of works increased and the system of contracts was in proved. From 1966 guaranteed payment for artists’ work on a par with the average industrial wage was introduced in the [[Leningrad Union of Artists|LOSKh]]. This innovation affected around 500 practitioners in all branches of the fine arts. In the 1970s a new exhibition hall of the Artists’ Union was opened in the Okhta area of the city as well as the [[Saint Petersburg Manege|Manege Central Exhibition Hall]]. In 1961 artists were presented with the celebrated House on Pesochny Embankment, containing 50 apartments and 100 art studios for sculptors, painters and graphic artists. Construction of housing and permanent studios for artists was launched on [[Vasilyevsky Island]] and the Okhta, in the town of Pushkin and other parts of the city. [[House of Creativity "Staraya Ladoga"|The House of Artists’ Creativity in Staraya Ladoga]] was enlarged and reconstructed, becoming a favourite place for Leningrad painters to work. In this period many artists worked at the [[Academicheskaya Dacha|"Academic Dacha"]], at the RSFSR Artists’ Union's creative centres in Gurzuf in the Crimea, on Lakes Baikal and Seliger and the spa town of Goryachy Klyuch in the Northern Caucasus.

[[File:Catalog-Fine-Arts-of-Leningrad-76-bw.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Fine Arts of Leningrad (Exhibition, 1976)|Fine Arts of Leningrad Exhibition Catalog]]. 1976.]]

A whole system of art exhibitions was established, in which a central place was taken by the Leningrad "zonal exhibitions". They preceded the republic-level "Soviet Russia" exhibitions. The first [["Leningrad" zonal art exhibition (1964)|"Leningrad" zonal exhibition]] was held in 1964 and became one of the largest presentations of the city's fine art in the whole of its history.&lt;ref&gt;Ленинград. Зональная выставка. Л: Художник РСФСР, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, zonal exhibitions were held regularly and contracts were made for works to be produced for them. It was from the zonal and republican exhibitions that the bulk of purchases were made by museums, the Ministry of Culture and the Art Fund of Russian Federation. Most significant in terms of numbers of participants and the quality of works were [[Exhibition of Leningrad artists (1961)|"Exhibition of the Works of Leningrad Artists 1961"]] ([[Russian Museum]]), a series of exhibitions under the title "Our Contemporary" in the [[Russian Museum]], including the [["Our Contemporary" regional art exhibition (Leningrad,1975)|1975 Zonal exhibition]], [[By native country (Leningrad, 1972)|"Across Our Native Land"]] (1972, [[Russian Museum]]), [[Fine Arts of Leningrad (Moscow, 1976)|"Leningrad Fine Art"]] (1976, Moscow), [[Art belongs to the people (Leningrad, 1977)|"Art Belongs to the People"]] (1977, [[Saint Petersburg Manege|Manege Central Exhibition Hall]]), [[Regional Art exhibition (Leningrad, 1980)|"The Zonal Exhibition of Works by Leningrad Artists 1980"]] ([[Saint Petersburg Manege|Manege Central Exhibition Hall]]), and the retrospective exhibition "Liberated Person" (1987, [[Russian Museum]]). The exhibition "Contemporary Leningrad Art" (1988), (Saint Petersburg Manege|Manege Central Exhibition Hall) brought together for the first time members of the Leningrad branch of the Artists’ Union, primarily belonging to the "leftist" wing, amateur artists and representatives of "unofficial art". Each year there were traditional spring and autumn exhibitions, and, from the mid-1970s, veterans’ exhibitions. Among the group exhibitions that caused a stir were "The Exhibition of 11 artists" (1972), "The Exhibition of 9 artists" (1976), the three-man exhibition of [[Sergei Ivanovich Osipov|Sergei Osipov]], [[Arseny Semionov]], and Кirill Guschin (1977, [[Leningrad Union of Artists|LOSKh]]) and an exhibition of 26 Moscow and Leningrad artists (1990, [[Saint Petersburg Manege|Manege Central Exhibition Hall]]). Among the personal exhibitions (all held in the LOSKh unless otherwise shown) that became events in the city's artistic life were those of [[Piotr Buchkin]] (1961), [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]] (1963), [[Nikolai Timkov]] (1964, 1975), [[Vladimir Gorb]] (1967), [[Victor Oreshnikov]] (1974, Academy of Arts), Leonid Kabachek (1975), [[Engels Kozlov]] (1976), Alexander Vedernikov (1977), [[Yuri Neprintsev]] (1979, Academy of Arts), Vladimir Tokarev (1980), [[Elena Skuin]] (1980), [[Yaroslav Krestovsky]] (1981), [[Evsey Moiseenko]] (1982, [[Russian Museum]]), [[Mikhail Natarevich]] (1982), [[Sergei Yefimovich Zakharov|Sergei Zakharov]] (1984), [[Vitaly Tulenev]] (1985), [[Boris Lavrenko]] (1986, Academy of Arts), [[Yaroslav Nikolaev]] (1986), [[Olga Bogaevskaya]] (1987), [[Piotr Belousov]] (1987, Academy of Arts), [[Nikolai Galakhov]] (1988), [[Vladimir Ovchinnikov (painter)|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]] (1988), [[Alexander Mikhailovich Semionov|Alexander Semionov]] (1988), [[Boris Ugarov]] (1988, ГРМ), [[Vecheslav Zagonek]] (1990, Academy of Arts), [[Sergei Ivanovich Osipov|Sergei Osipov]] (1991), [[Gleb Savinov]] (1991), [[Semion Rotnitsky]] (1991) and a number of others. The fine art of Leningrad was invariably represented broadly at republican, All-Union and foreign exhibitions of Soviet art.

In 1974–75 the city's Gaza and Nevsky Palaces of Culture were the venues for events that went down in the history of the Leningrad underground as the first permitted exhibitions of non-conformist artists and gave the ironic name "gazonevshchina" to one of the phenomena in the artistic life of the 1970s and 1980s. In 1982 the Fellowship of Experimental Fine Art (TEII), an informal grouping of predominantly "leftist" artists, came into being. The TEII's first exhibition took place that same year. The creators of the TEII declared their aim to be "uniting artists to improve their work in an atmosphere of creativity and mutual support founded on democratic traditions".&lt;ref&gt;Время перемен. Искусство 1960—1985 в Советском Союзе. / Альманах. Вып.140. СПб: Palace Editions, 2006. C. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; The TEII existed until 1988.

The 1960s and 1970s were a period of true maturity for Leningrad painting. Those years saw many major figures, including [[Evsey Moiseenko]], [[Vecheslav Zagonek]], [[Boris Korneev]], [[Gleb Savinov]], [[Nikolai Timkov]], [[Sergei Ivanovich Osipov|Sergei Osipov]], Leonid Kabachek, [[Arseny Semionov]], [[Vladimir Ovchinnikov (painter)|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]], [[Alexei Eriomin]], [[Nikolai Pozdneev]], [[Mikhail Kaneev]], [[Maya Kopitseva]] and [[Ivan Savenko]], at the height of their creative powers.

The works of [[Victor Teterin]], [[Yaroslav Krestovsky]], [[German Yegoshin]], [[Evgenia Antipova]], [[Vasily Golubev (painter)|Vasily Golubev]], [[Vitaly Tulenev]], [[Leonid Tkachenko (artist)|Leonid Tkachenko]], [[Valery Vatenin]] and Zaven Arshakuny reflected the spirit of search and change in its Leningrad dimension. From strict objectivism founded on the experience of Russian realist painting of the second half of the 19th century, artists turned to a search for individually striking form in painting, affirming the idea of the value of a creative personality's inner world. At the same time the leaders of the "left wing" of the [[Leningrad Union of Artists|LOSKh]] remained within the mainstream of the traditional Russian understanding of the purpose of art, which insisted upon a concept having meaningfulness and moral purpose.

[[File:Russov-Leningrad-Symphony-7port42bw.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Lev Russov]]&lt;br /&gt;The Leningrad Symphony. Conductor Yevgeny Mravinsky.  1980.]]

Among the best known works from this period are the paintings Leningrad Woman (In 1941) (1961) by [[Boris Ugarov]], Morning (1961), The Storm Has Passed (1961) and The Bird-Cherry Is in Blossom (1964) by [[Vecheslav Zagonek]], Parting (1975) and the Spain triptych (1979) by [[Andrei Mylnikov]], The Reds Have Arrived (1961), Mothers, Sisters (1967), Sweet Cherries (1969) and Victory (1972) by [[Evsey Moiseenko]], About Tomorrow (1961), Trains Are Taking the Lads Away (1965) and Thoughts (1970) by Leonid Kabachek, Maternal Thoughts (1969) by [[Alexei Eriomin]], Black Gold (1969) by [[Engels Kozlov]], Victory Day (1975) and The First Tractor (1980) by [[Gleb Savinov]], Watchmakers (1968) by [[Yaroslav Krestovsky]], Portrait of Shostakovich (1964) and Sviatoslav Richter (1972) by [[Joseph Serebriany]], Childhood Street (1972) by [[Vitaly Tulenev]], Happy Woman (1969) by Andrey Yakovlev, Portrait of Boris Piotrovsky (1971) by [[Victor Oreshnikov]], Self-Portrait (1974) by Larisa Kirillova, Russian Winter. Hoarfrost (1969) by [[Nikolai Timkov]], and The Leningrad Symphony, Mravinsky Conducting (1980) by [[Lev Russov]].

The achievements of Leningrad sculpture of the 1960s–80s are associated with the names of [[Mikhail Anikushin]], Vera Isaevs, Levon Lazarev, Boris Kaplansky, Мoisey Whyman, Vasily Stamov, Lubov Kholina, Maria Kharlamova, Nikolai Kochukov, Iya Venkova, Vasily Astapov, Valentina Rybalko, Grigory Yastrebenetsky and others. Among the best known works are the monument to Maxim Gorky (1968, sculptor Vera Isaeva, architect Efim Levinson), the monument to Giacomo Quarenghi (1967, sculptor Levon Lazarev, architect Мikhail Meysel), the monument to Lenin on Moscow Square (1970, sculptor [[Mikhail Anikushin]]), the memorial to The Heroic Defenders of Leningrad on Victory Square (1975, sculptor [[Mikhail Anikushin]], architects Vasily Kamensky, Sergei Speransky), the monument to Nikolai Nekrasov (1971, sculptor Мikhail Eidlin, architect Vladimir Vasilkovsky).

This period saw development in all the forms of graphic art traditional for Leningrad: book illustration, etching, lithography, linocut, drawing and the poster. In book illustration deserved fame accrued to the works of Yuri Vasnetsov, Eugene Charushin, [[Alexei Pakhomov]] , Gennady Epifanov, Boris Kalaushin, Oleg Pochtenny, Кirill Ovchinnikov, Alexander Traugot, Valery Traugot, Vladimir Beskaravainy and Valentin Kurdov. The art of etching was enriched by the creations of [[Yuri Neprintsev]], Valentina Petrova, Leonid Petrov, Alexander Kharshak, Аnatoli Smirnov, Vladimir Shistko and Vasily Zvontsov, while Vladimir Vetrogonsky, Victor Valtsefer, Оleg Ivanov and Vadim Smirnov worked successfully in the field of lithography.

In the decorative and applied art of Leningrad, too, in the 1960–1980s, as Natalia Taranovskaya puts it, "features of a single school were forming". In porcelain, ceramics and glass related concepts of the beauty of shapes and ideal proportions took hold. In this period significant works were produced by the porcelain artists Vladimir Gorodetsky, Nina Slavina, Alexei Vorobievsky and Аnna Leporskaya, the ceramists Vladimir Vasilkovsky, Natalia Savinova, Alexander Zadorin, Inna Olevskaya and Мikhail Kopilkov, the glass artists Boris Smirnov, Leyda Yurgen, Аlexandra Ostroumova, Helle Pild, Ekaterina Yanovskaya and Serafima Bogdanova and the fabric designers Sarah Buntsus, Nika Moiseeva, Inna Rakhimova, Rose Krestovskaya and Тatiana Prozorova. Alongside the acknowledged leaders of Leningrad's artistic industries – the Leningrad Lomonosov Porcelain Factory, the Leningrad Artistic Glassworks, the Slutskaya Textile Mill and the Russkiye Samotsvety jewellery factory – new manufacturing facilities appeared in which members of Leningrad's young generation of specialists in decorative and applied art realized their ambitious ideas.

== Criticism and Legacy ==

In 1992, after the break-up of the USSR and Leningrad being renamed Saint Petersburg, the Saint Petersburg Artists’ Union was formed, which became the legal successor to the Leningrad branch of the Artists’ Union of the RSFSR. By that time funds were no longer being allocated for the official purchase of works of fine art. The Art Fund had also ceased to exist and its enterprises were liquidated or lost to the Artists’ Union. The [[House of Creativity "Staraya Ladoga"|House of Creativity in Staraya Ladoga]] had also been lost. The artistic glassworks was closed down. There was a real threat of the single St Petersburg Artists’ Union breaking apart and the historical building of the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts being lost.
In this period Leningrad practitioners of the fine arts, using their authority and the support of colleagues and the public, were able to preserve the unity of the St Petersburg Artists’ Union and the Academy of Arts as a school. Therein lies not only their great service to St Petersburg art but at the same time a symbolic handover from the Leningrad masters of the fine arts to new generations of St Petersburg artists. The contemporary development of the fine arts in Saint Petersburg demonstrates that in their wide variety of forms and manifestations they are guided by the finest traditions and achievements of Leningrad's exponents of painting, graphic art, monumental and applied art. Their works are to be found not only in the displays and stocks of major art museums and private collections. We encounter them on the pages of books and in a domestic setting. They adorn the squares, streets and public buildings of towns and cities. As a consequence this art not only continues to live an active life, but also inspires our contemporaries to draw upon and reinterpret its experience. This applies to such themes as the consequences of the formation in 1932 of a single [[Leningrad Union of Artists|LOSKh]], Socialist Realism and the competition of directions and tendencies in the fine arts in Leningrad, the concept of a "Leningrad school" and more. For example, regarding the formation of a single [[Leningrad Union of Artists|LOSKh]], Valeria Ushakova writes: "We cannot deny that one of the main criteria for the assessment of works of art was professionalism. Paradoxical as it might be, it was precisely the struggle for so-called ‘ideological purity’ that enabled Russian (Soviet) art to preserve its school... It was precisely the political choice in favour of realism that made it possible to preserve the traditions of true Russian realism and the splendid artistic school despite all the negative aspects of ideological pressure."&lt;ref&gt;Ушакова, В. А. Прошлое и настоящие Ленинградского — Санкт-Петербургского Союз художников // Художники — городу. Выставка к 70-летию Санкт-Петербургского Союза художников. СПб: Петрополь, 2003. С. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flag of [[Dominica]]''' was adopted on 3 November 1978, with some small changes having been made in 1981, 1988, and 1990. The original flag was designed by playwright Alwin Bully in early 1978 as the country prepared for independence.&lt;ref name=dominicanews&gt;{{cite news|first=|last= |title=Today is Flag Day in Dominica |url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/culture/today-is-flag-day-in-dominica/ |work=[[Dominica News Online]] |date=19 October 2011|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and design==
The flag, adopted in 1978, features the national bird emblem, the [[Imperial amazon|sisserou parrot]], which also appears on the [[Coat of arms of Dominica|coat of arms]] granted on 21 July 1961. This parrot, endemic to Dominica, is an endangered species with a population of only 250–350 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22686411/0 "Amazona imperialis"], The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Retrieved 12 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The green field represents the lush vegetation of the island. The cross represents the [[Trinity]] and [[Christianity]], with its three colours symbolising the natives, the fertile soil, and the pure water. The 10 green five-pointed stars stand for the country's 10 [[parish]]es: ([[Saint Andrew Parish, Dominica|St Andrew]], [[Saint David Parish, Dominica|St David]], [[Saint George Parish, Dominica|St George]], [[Saint John Parish, Dominica|St John]], [[Saint Joseph Parish, Dominica|St Joseph]], [[Saint Luke Parish, Dominica|St Luke]], [[Saint Mark Parish, Dominica|St Mark]], [[Saint Patrick Parish, Dominica|St Patrick]], [[Saint Paul Parish, Dominica|St Paul]], and [[Saint Peter Parish, Dominica|St Peter]]), while the red disc stands for justice.

The sisserou parrot is sometimes coloured either blue or purple (the parrot's actual colour). The use of [[purple]] makes the flag of Dominica one of only two flags of sovereign states (alongside the [[flag of Nicaragua]]) to contain the colour.

The flag of Dominica, along with other national symbols, was the focus of a government-sponsored "Emblems Week" in 2016. An initiative of the independence committee, Emblems Week is aimed at reflecting on the meaning of the national emblems, and promoting their use among members of the general public and particularly among the country's schools. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.gov.dm/index.php/news/4075-dominica-observes-first-ever-emblems-week|title=Dominica Observes First Ever ‘Emblems Week’|first=GIS|last=Dominica|website=www.news.gov.dm|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- IMPORTANT NOTICE: Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Plot summaries are recommended to be 400-700 words. --&gt;
Nelson Wright, a medical student, walks onto a beach one day and proclaims “today is a good day to die”. He later convinces four of his medical school classmates—Joe Hurley, David Labraccio, Randy Steckle, and Rachel Manus—to help him discover what lies beyond death. Nelson flatlines for one minute before his classmates resuscitate him. While "dead", he experiences a sort of afterlife. He sees a vision of a boy he bullied as a child, Billy Mahoney. He merely tells his friends that he cannot describe what he saw, but something is there. The others follow Nelson's daring feat.

Joe flatlines next, and he experiences an erotic afterlife sequence. He agrees with Nelson's claim that something indeed exists. David is third to flatline, and he sees a vision of a girl, Winnie Hicks, whom he bullied in grade school. The three men start to experience hallucinations related to their afterlife visions. Nelson gets physically beat up by Billy Mahoney twice. Joe, engaged to be married, is haunted by his home videos of his sexual dalliances with other women. David finds Winnie Hicks on a train, and she verbally taunts him the way he taunted her. 

Rachel decides to flatline next on Halloween. David tries to stop the others from giving Rachel their same fate, but she is already "dead" when he arrives. Rachel nearly dies for good after the power goes out, and the men are unable to shock her with the [[defibrillator]] paddles. Luckily, she survives, but she, too, is haunted by the memory of her father committing suicide when she was young.

The three men finally reveal their harrowing experiences to one another, and David decides to put his visions to a stop. Meanwhile, Joe's fiancée, Anne, comes to his apartment, and she breaks up with him after she discovers his videos. Joe's visions cease after Anne leaves him. 

David goes to visit Winnie Hicks, now grown up, and apologizes to her. Winnie accepts his apology and thanks him. David immediately feels a weight lifted off his shoulders. Then, David finds Nelson, who accompanied David to visit Winnie, beating himself with a climbing axe. In Nelson's mind, however, Billy Mahoney is attempting for a third time to beat him to death. David stops him, and they return to town.

Rachel seeks comfort in the arms of David, and the two spend the night together. While Rachel and David are together, Nelson takes Steckle and Joe to a graveyard. He reveals that he killed Billy Mahoney as a kid by throwing rocks at him until he fell out of a tree. Nelson storms off, leaving Joe and Steckle stranded.

David leaves Rachel alone in order to rescue Joe and Steckle at the cemetery. While alone, Rachel goes to the bathroom, and finds her father. He apologizes to his daughter, and her guilt over his death is lifted when she discovers that he was addicted to heroin. Then, Nelson calls Rachel, and he tells her that he needs to flatline again in order to make amends. He apologizes for involving her and their friends in his stupid plan.

The three men race to Nelson, who has been dead for an estimated nine minutes already. Rachel soon finds them, and the four friends work feverishly to save Nelson. In the afterlife, Nelson is experiencing himself as a young boy being stoned by Billy Mahoney from the tree. Nelson dies in the afterlife from the fall, and his friends cannot revive him. When they are about to give up, Mahoney forgives Nelson, and David gives Nelson one last shock. This brings him back, and Nelson tells them, "Today wasn't a good day to die."

==Reception==
The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 48% of critics give the film a positive review based on 44 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flatliners/ ''Flatliners'', Rotten Tomatoes.] Accessed March 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a score 55 out of 100, based 10 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/flatliners|title=Flatliners|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Metacritic]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Caryn James wrote, "when taken on its own stylish terms, ''Flatliners'' is greatly entertaining. Viewers are likely to go along with this film instantly or else ridicule it to death. Its atmospheric approach doesn't admit much middle ground."&lt;ref&gt;James, Caryn. [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE6D91F39F933A2575BC0A966958260 "Young Doctors Explore the Boundary Between Life and Death", ''New York Times'' (August 10, 1990).] Accessed May 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Roger Ebert]] praised the film as "an original, intelligent thriller, well-directed by Joel Schumacher" and called the cast "talented young actors, [who] inhabit the shadows with the right mixture of intensity, fear and [[Self-confidence|cockiness]]". But Ebert criticized ''Flatliners'' for "plot manipulation that is unworthy of the brilliance of its theme. I only wish it had been restructured so we didn't need to go through the same crisis so many times."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger.

It's a movie about daring that dares nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Travers, Peter. [https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948163/review/5948164/flatliners ''Flatliners'' review, ''Rolling Stone'' #584 (Aug. 9, 1990).] Accessed Mar. 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a "D" rating and [[Owen Gleiberman]] wrote, "What isn't in evidence is the sort of overheated lunacy that made the [[William Hurt]] speed-freak trip movie ''[[Altered States]]'' (1980) such delectable trash. ''Flatliners'' is [[campy|camp]], but of a very low order. Schumacher is too intent on pandering to the youth market to take the mad risks and plunges that make for a scintillating bad movie."&lt;ref&gt;Gleiberman, Owen.

''Entertainment Weekly'' (Aug. 10, 1990).] Accessed January 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''[[The Washington Post|The Washington Post's]]'' Rita Kempley loved the film, calling it: "a heart-stopping, breathtakingly sumptuous haunted house of a movie".&lt;ref&gt;Kempley, Rita.

'''Furby''' is an American [[Electronics|electronic]] [[robot]]ic toy released in 1998 by [[Tiger Electronics]]. It resembles a [[hamster]] or [[owl]]-like creature and went through a period of being a "[[Fad|must-have]]" toy following its [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday season]] launch, with continual sales until 2000. Over 40 million Furbies were sold during the three years of its original production, with 1.8 million sold in 1998, and 14 million in 1999. Its speaking capabilities were translated into 24 languages.

Furbies were the first successful attempt to produce and sell a [[domestic robot|domestically-aimed robot]]. A newly purchased Furby starts out speaking entirely "Furbish", the unique language that all Furbies use, but is programmed to start using English words and phrases in place of Furbish over time. This process is intended to resemble the process of learning English.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/encounterswithkismet.pdf |date=2004-09-30 |publisher=[[MIT]] |title=Encounters with Kismet and Cog: Children Respond to Relational Artifacts |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated Emoto-Tronic Furby, with voice-recognition and more complex facial movements, was sold by [[Hasbro]] between 2005–2007. They released another updated Furby with [[LCD]] eyes and a [[mobile app]] for the holiday season in 2012.

==History==

===Initial creation===
Dave Hampton and Caleb Chung spent nine months creating the Furby (in addition to nine months spent designing the toy). After two attempts at licensing the concept, they invited fellow toy and game inventor Richard C. Levy to join their efforts to sell Furby. Levy brought Furby to Tiger Electronics and Tiger's Roger Shiffman bought the rights to it. Furby's first public appearance was at the American International Toy Fair in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Banks |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/june/toys/index.html |title=Furby Co-Inventor Richard Levy |publisher=NPR |date=2002-06-18 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/rlevy.html |title=Inventor of the Week: Archive |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sloane |first=Julie |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2002/07/01/325614/index.htm |title=Game Theories The man who made the Furby fly explains how he comes up with his ideas. – July 1, 2002 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2002-07-01 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://andelman.com/2010/10/complete-idiots-guide-author-and-furby-inventor-richard-c-levy-creates-ways-to-avoid-mr-media/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306044136/http://andelman.com/2010/10/complete-idiots-guide-author-and-furby-inventor-richard-c-levy-creates-ways-to-avoid-mr-media/ |date=March 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Furby, a McDonaldsToy circa 2001, with bright blue coat.jpg|thumb|Furby toy from McDonald's]]
Furbies originally retailed for about US$35,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9810/05/furby/index.html |date=1998-10-05 |publisher=CNN |title=New toy an interactive fur ball |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upon release, they sold very well. Catapulting demand during the 1998 Christmas period drove the resale price over $100, and sometimes as high as several hundred dollars. Furbies sold for over $300 in newspapers and in auctions. Nicknames were given to the different aesthetic varieties, and sellers assigned rarity values to them.

The significant aftermarket demand (and price) for the toy resulted in cases of fraud in which customers paid for Furbies that were never delivered. Parental battles, arguments, and fights increased rapidly as supplies dwindled, and when retail supplies ran out, parents turned to the [[Internet]], where Furbies could be purchased for two, three, or more multiples of their retail price. During one 12-month period, a total of 27 million Furby toys were sold.&lt;ref name="Furby 4"&gt;{{cite web|last=Collecting|first=Furbys|title=Furbys &amp; Furby Collecting|url=http://www.worldcollectorsnet.com/features/furbys/|work=Yes|publisher=Word CollectorsNet|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 revival===
2005 saw the reintroduction of Furby with the release of the new Emoto-Tronic Furby.

===2012 revival===
On April 12, 2012, it was announced that Hasbro would be making a new line of Furbies. The new line was released in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/308423/furby-s-coming-back-five-things-to-know-about-this-iconic-toy |title=Furby's Coming Back! Five Things to Know About This Iconic Toy |publisher=E! Online |date=2012-04-12 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2012 there were sixteen colors: Teal, white, black, purple, tangerine-tango, yellow, aqua, navy blue, plum, pink, pink/teal, orange/blue, black/pink, blue/yellow, teal/purple, gray/teal.&lt;ref name=Furby&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasbro|first=Electronics|title=Furby|url=http://m.furby.com/furby_en_US/catalog?cid=2750936&amp;p=2&amp;ps=10&amp;s=7&amp;k=|work=Yes|publisher=Hasbro|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furbies were one of the eleven toys named top toys for Christmas 2013 by the Toy Retailers Association at the DreamToys Convention where they unveil their predictions for most popular holiday toys annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Toys for Christmas 2013|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2013/12/07/top-toys-for-christmas-2013/20783883/#!slide=1915852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Classic Furbies===
The main reason for their popularity{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} was because of apparent "intelligence", reflected in their ability to develop language skills.

Furbies can communicate with one another via an [[infrared]] port located between their eyes. Furbies start out speaking entirely "Furbish", a language with short words, simple syllables, and various other sounds. They are programmed, however, to speak less and less Furbish and more and more [[English language|English]] as they "grow".

There was a common misconception that they repeated words that were said around them. This belief most likely stemmed from the fact that it is possible to have the Furby say certain pre-programmed words or phrases more often by petting it whenever it said these words. As a result of this myth, several [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] banned them from their offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/13/nsa.furby.ban.01 |publisher=CNN |date=1999-01-13 |title=Furby a threat to national security? |accessdate=2006-12-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060828044552/http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/13/nsa.furby.ban.01 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple electric motor and a system of cams and gears close the Furby's eyes and mouth, raise its ears, and lift it off the ground in a ''faux'' display of mobility.

The originals are popular with many [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hackers]] as they can be dissected and made to do interesting things. In particular, their advanced audio capabilities and various sensory interfaces make them popular with the [[circuit bending]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|LPvW8R1zbD0|Circuit-bent Furby}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circuit-bent.net/furby-bending-tutorial.html |title=Furby Bending Tutorial |first=Kevin |last=Rees |publisher=Circuit-Bent.Net |accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Furbies===

====Furby Babies====
In 1999, the Furby Babies line was introduced. Furby Babies are smaller than the original, have higher voices, and cannot dance, but they switch to speaking English more quickly. They also have an extended vocabulary and different "Easter eggs" and "games" built into them. Furby babies come in 24 different colors. All have white eyelashes and one of six different eyecolors.

====Furby Friends====
Novel Furbies were also released, including an interactive Furby-like "Gizmo", from the film ''[[Gremlins]]'', a Furby-like "Interactive [[Yoda]]" based on the Star Wars character, and a Furby-like "Interactive [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]" from the movie of the same name. Another "friend of Furby", called "Shelby", is similar to Furby, but looks like a clam, has vast improvements in memory, and has a different personality; it was released in 2001 and can communicate with the original Furbies and Furby Babies. They also have sensors that can sense loud sounds, can sense being upside down (they say things like "Shiver me timbers" and "Walk the plank" when left them upside-down for an extended period of time), and they laugh when "tickled" (their antennae&amp;nbsp;– or "tennies", as they like to call them). They also purr when "petted". They can be fed by sticking a finger in their mouth. Similarly, Shelbies do not have their own names, unlike the classic Furbies. Shelbies are also capable of knowing if it is talking to a Furby or another Shelby, saying phrases such as "Where's Furby?"—though they cannot differentiate between a Furby and a Furby Baby—they just assume it is a Furby. In addition to English, Shelbies also know some Furbish words and also have their own unique language called "Shelbish".{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

====Emoto-Tronic Furbies====

This Furby was released in August 2005. Larger than the previous version, the new Furbies have been upgraded with a more emotional face and a voice recognition system, enabling them to communicate with humans. Unlike the Furbies originally released, just one order is necessary to make them 'sleep', and they have an on/off switch. They can communicate with other Emoto-tronic Furbies, though to a lesser extent than the communication between original Furbies, and they cannot themselves communicate with the original Furbies nor Funky Furbies. They also lack light sensors and basic motion sensors and do not respond to loud sounds as the originals do. These Furbies, according to the story they come packed with, are from Furby Island.

====Emoto-Tronic Furby Babies====
In 2006, a new version of Furby baby was released, with most notable features being the new look and a more "baby-ish" appearance in contrast to the Emoto-Tronic Furby adult. They also have considerably fewer features than the "adult" Furby, with a very limited vocabulary and a lower level of interactivity. Another notable feature of the 2006 Emoto-Tronic Baby Furby is the movable "legs" which unfurl when Furby baby is awake. Although they were a European exclusive, they were sold in the US via the Hasbro Toy Shop website.

====Emoto-Tronic Funky Furbies====
The Funky Furbies were released in August 2006 outside the United States. They are limited to two color combinations (pink and yellow; purple and green), and they can sing three new songs and dance. They can be taught dance routines and remember them.

====2012 Furbies====
A new Furby was released in the fall of 2012. It has more expressive LCD eyes, a wider range of motions, its own [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app, and the ability to adapt its personality in reaction to user behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=8/24/12 12:00pm 8/24/12 12:00pm |url=https://gizmodo.com/5937402/the-new-furby-review-absolute-horror |title=The New Furby Review: Absolute Horror |publisher=Gizmodo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The on-off switch is replaced with a reset button; the Furby turns itself off after one minute of inactivity.

====Furby Party Rockers====
Furby's smaller friends launched March 2013 and unlike their full-sized Furby companions, which grow and learn through human interaction, each Party Rocker is born with its own unique personality, making ready to interact with its owner straight from the box. There are four Furby Party Rockers, called Twitby, Fussby, Scoffby and Loveby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furbypartyrockers.co.uk/ |title=Furby Party Rockers |publisher=Furby Party Rockers |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Furby Boom====
In summer of 2013, about a year after the Furby 2012 came out, a new Furby was released with new different colors and new Personalities. It has a brand new [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)]] app, called Furby BOOM, with many new features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2427353,00.asp|title=Furby Boom|author=|date=|work=PCMAG}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/11196342/Furby-that-interacts-with-iPads-is-among-must-have-Christmas-toys.html|title=Furby that interacts with iPads is among 'must-have' Christmas toys|author=|date=30 October 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Furblings (toy version)====
In June 2014, a toy version of the Furblings from the Furby Boom app was released along with a Golden limited time one.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} It can communicate with Furby Booms, and can be used with the app too.

====Furby Boom Crystal====
The release for Christmas 2014 is called the Furby Boom Crystal series, with a redesign of the ears, face and feet and a new bright neon fur. The [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] apps have also been redesigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Furby Boom Crystal Series Review|url=http://boomcrystaltoys.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Furby Boom Crystal Furblings====
In early 2015, it announced toy version of the Furby Boom Crystal Furblings from the app were released. Like the other Furblings, it can communicate with Furby Boom Crystals, and be used with the app.

====Furbacca====
In June 2015, a Furby that resembles Chewbacca from Star Wars was released. It is similar to the Furby Boom because it can hatch Furblings with the same app and more. It is known as the Wookie Furby and the new Furby Friend.

====Furby Connect====
In 2016 another new Furby with more expressive eyes and movements was released, along with an app containing a whole world of Furblings for it to interact with. The Furby Connect has a translucent plastic joystick on its head which lights up different colors when toggled and is used to control games played with Furblings in the app. Unlike the 2012 Furby and Furby Boom, the Furby Connect does not change personalities. However it can sing songs that it "learns" from the app.

==Security concerns==
On January 13, 1999, it was reported the [[National Security Agency]] of the United States banned Furbies from entering NSA's property due to concerns that they may be used to record and repeat classified information, advising those that see any on NSA property to "contact their Staff Security Officer for guidance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/254094.stm|title=BBC News – Americas – Furby toy or Furby spy?|author=|date=|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/furbies-banned-at-us-spy-base-1046935.html|title=Furbies banned at US spy base|author=|date=|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/13/nsa.furby.ban.01 |title=CNN – Furby a threat to national security? – January 13, 1999 |author= |date= |work=archive.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826021319/http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/13/nsa.furby.ban.01/ |archivedate=August 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Shiffman, the owner of Tiger Electronics, stated that "Furby has absolutely no ability to do any recording whatsoever," and that he would have gladly told the NSA this if he was asked by anyone from the spy agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/14/julianborger1 |title=Secret agent Furby sneaks into spies' inner sanctum |date=14 January 1999 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2017}} Additionally, Dave Hampton demonstrated that Furby's microphone can't record any sound at all, and can only hear a single monotonous beep if a loud sound is produced around Furby, and no words or waveforms can be made out at all.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} He too was never questioned by the NSA.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The ban was eventually withdrawn.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Security researchers discovered that the microphone on a Furby Connect can be remotely activated and used to record voice through a [[Bluetooth]] connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/technology/connected-toys-hacking.html?hpw&amp;rref=technology&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=well-region&amp;region=bottom-well&amp;WT.nav=bottom-well|title=A Cute Toy Just Brought a Hacker Into Your Home|last=Frenkel|first=Sheera|date=21 December 2017|work=[[New York Times]]|access-date=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furbish-English phrases==
"Furbish" is the Furbies' language, with simple syllables, short words, and various sounds. A newly purchased Furby starts out speaking entirely in Furbish. Over time, the Furby gradually replaces Furbish words and phrases with English.
* '''wee-tah-kah-loo-loo''': Tell me a joke.
* '''wee-tah-kah-wee-loo''': Tell me a story.
* '''wee-tee-kah-wah-tee''': Sing me a song.
* '''u-nye-loo-lay-doo?''': Do you want to play?
* '''u-nye-ay-tay-doo?''': Are you hungry?
* '''u-nye-boh-doo?''': How are you?
* '''u-nye-way-loh-nee-way''': Go to sleep now.
* '''u-nye-noh-lah''': Show me a dance.

Furbies may say these Furbish words:
* '''doo?''': What? (Furbies say this when called)
* '''doo-dah''': Yes. (Furbies say this in response to a command before doing it)
* '''boo''': No. (Furbies say this when they do not want to carry out a command)
* '''yoo?''': Why will you not play with me today? (This usually means the Furby is upset)

==Film adaptation==
[[Bob Weinstein]] announced in November 2016 that a Furby film adaptation is to be produced by [[The Weinstein Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNary |first=Dave |date=2 November 2016 |title=AFM: Bob Weinstein Unveils Furby Movie for TWC-Dimension |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/afm-bob-weinstein-furby-movie-twc-dimension-1201907667/ |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |access-date=10 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was written by Daniel Persitz and Devon Kliger, and will contain both [[live action]] and [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] characters.&lt;ref name=slash&gt;{{cite news |last=Anderton |first=Ethan |date=4 November 2016 |title=There’s a Furby Movie in the Works, Because That Toy Was a Thing Once |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/furby-movie/ |publisher=[[/Film]] |access-date=10 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the film's narrative, Hasbro executive Stephen Davis stated that "we think that this can resonate as a [[four-quadrant movie|four-quadrant film]].

The '''Gruber Collection''' is a collection of books and manuscripts housed at the [[Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois. The collection contain more than 300 books from the 15th to 18th centuries and 14 manuscripts of Greek New Testament (minuscules and lectionaries).

'''Hatching''' (''hachure'' in [[French language|French]]) is an artistic technique used to create tonal or shading effects by [[drawing]] (or painting or scribing) closely spaced parallel lines. (It is also used in [[monochromatic]] [[heraldic]] representations to indicate what the [[Tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] of a "full-colour" [[Blazon|emblazon]] would be.) When lines are placed at an angle to one another, it is called '''cross-hatching'''.

Hatching is especially important in essentially linear media, such as drawing, and many forms of [[printmaking]], such as [[engraving]], [[etching]] and [[woodcut]]. In Western art, hatching originated in the [[Middle Ages]], and developed further into cross-hatching, especially in the [[old master print]]s of the fifteenth century. [[Master ES]] and [[Martin Schongauer]] in engraving and [[Erhard Reuwich]] and [[Michael Wolgemut]] in woodcut were pioneers of both techniques, and [[Albrecht Dürer]] in particular perfected the technique of crosshatching in both media.

Artists use the technique, varying the [[length]], [[angle]], closeness and other qualities of the lines, most commonly in drawing, linear painting and engraving.

==Technique==
The main concept is that the quantity, thickness and spacing of the lines will affect the brightness of the overall image, and emphasize forms creating the illusion of [[volume]]. Hatching lines should always follow (i.e. wrap around) the form. By increasing quantity, thickness and closeness, a darker area will result.

An area of shading next to another area which has lines going in another direction is often used to create [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]].

Line work can be used to represent colours, typically by using the same type of hatch to represent particular [[Tints and shades|tones]]. For example, red might be made up of lightly spaced lines, whereas green could be made of two layers of [[perpendicular]] dense lines, resulting in a realistic image.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2809">The '''Home Arts and Industries Association''' was part of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in Britain. It was founded in 1884 by [[Eglantyne Louisa Jebb]], mother of [[Save the Children]] founder, [[Eglantyne Jebb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D. Maltz|title=British Aestheticism and the Urban Working Classes, 1870-1900: Beauty for the People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKftCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33|date=22 November 2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-50405-9|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial name, changed in 1885, was the "Cottage Arts Association".&lt;ref&gt;Janice Helland, ''Exhibiting Ireland: The Donegal Industrial Fund in London and Chicago'', RACAR: revue d'art canadienne / Canadian Art Review Vol. 29, No. 1/2 (2004), pp. 28–46, at p. 31. Published by: AAUC/UAAC (Association des universités d’art du Canada / Universities Art Association of Canada). Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/42630693&lt;/ref&gt; Jebb was inspired by an initiative of [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] in Philadelphia. Another leading member was the designer [[Mary Fraser Tytler]]. The organisation sought to revive traditional rural crafts which were threatened by the mechanisation of production and by increasing urbanization. In conformity with the thinking of [[John Ruskin]] and with Arts and Crafts philosophy, supporters believed that flourishing traditional crafts helped sustain rural communities and provided workers with far more personal satisfaction than was possible for factory workers. The Association funded schools and organised marketing opportunities for craftspeople. By 1889 it had 450 classes, 1,000 teachers and 5,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Naylor, ''The Arts and Crafts Movement'', London: Studio Vista, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the Associations’ annual exhibitions took place in July 1885 and by 1888 were large enough to take place in the [[Royal Albert Hall]], an annual occurrence until 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Albert Hall Archives&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 the Association moved their offices to the Hall as tenants of the building and continued their work of funding schools and organising marketing opportunities for craftspeople. In 1904 the Art Workers Quarterly said the association, '…is a society for teaching the working classes handicrafts such as wood carving, inlaying, metal repousse, basket weaving, leather work, book binding, and for encouraging these and others such as lace, embroidery spinning, weaving, pottery etc., by means of an annual exhibition'.&lt;ref&gt;The Art Workers Quarterly, Vol.3, p135-138, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph C. Lewis''' (born 5 February 1937) is a British businessman and investor, who currently lives in [[New Providence]] in the [[Bahamas]].

Lewis' total wealth is estimated at $US5 billion, and he is listed as the 388th richest person in ''[[Forbes]]''’ 2018 list of billionaires. Forbes reported that Lewis is the 12th wealthiest person in the UK, {{as of|2018|3|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

Lewis seeded Lake Nona, covering 7,000 acres next to Orlando’s international airport, with $100 million in gifts and land which was cultivated into a large-scale community offering research and educational facilities, hospitals for veterans and children, a town center, and a range of workspaces and residential options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/realestate/08medical.html | work=New York Times | title=Orlando’s Newest Attraction Is Medical | date=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Escondido Lake and controversy====
Since Lewis bought a property in [[Río Negro Province]], Argentina, public access to Escondido lake has been under discussion. The Argentine law asserts that every water course is public and of free access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/politica/joe-lewis-magnate-lago-escondido_0_V1cE1_yCl.html ¿Quién es Joe Lewis, el magnate dueño de Lago Escondido?], Clarín, 26 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Lewis was ordered by the Superior Tribunal de Justicia (STJ) to create and keep access to the lake, with "sufficient signage and to keep it transitable", but the ruling has not been enforced. Lewis' frontman Van Ditmer stated: "We are going to defend the private property with the Winchester in the hands; with blood if needed".&lt;ref name="cholilaonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cholilaonline.com/2017/01/joe-lewis-el-verdadero-patron-del-mal.html|title=Joe Lewis, el verdadero patrón del mal de la Patagonia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis' property encircles the lake. While some have called for another public mountain trail to be built to access the lake, El Consejo de Ecología y Medio Ambiente de Río Negro (the Council of Ecology and Environment of Río Negro) does not support building another pass, which would cause harm to the environmentally protected area.

He is currently planning to use a huge protected area, 4 times the size of the city of Buenos Aires, for another private development, against the wishes of the locals. The property was bought for 69 pesos per hectare, currently about $4 USD. This low price was secured by using the name of a local 'poblador' on the deed, after which it was transferred to him. It is suggested that the Hidden Lake property is needed to supply water and (hydraulic) energy to this new property, dubbed the private state in Patagonia. In January 2017, new mass protests have started in El Bolson against this project.&lt;ref name="cholilaonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cholilaonline.com/2017/01/dia-historico-en-el-bolson-mas-de-15.html|title=Día histórico en El Bolsón: Más de 15 mil personas marcharon contra el loteo de Joe Lewis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bear Stearns===
{{main|Bear Stearns}}
On 10 September 2007, Lewis paid [[US$]]860.4 million in an all-cash purchase of a 7% stake in Bear Stearns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aasVn8g.o2Js&amp;refer=home | work=Bloomberg | title=Bear Stearns Gains on Speculation About Stake Sale (Update5) | date=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2007 Lewis had raised his stake at the brokerage firm to 9.4%, a total of 11 million shares, for which he paid an average price of $107 apiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601213&amp;sid=aIOoem3ab3bo&amp;refer=home | work=Bloomberg | title=Lewis, Barrow Hanley Lose Combined $2 Billion on Bear (Update2) | date=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the purchase of [[Bear Stearns]] by [[JP Morgan]] for $10 a share, it was estimated that Lewis lost $1.16 billion on his investment.&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120571021671940207 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=A Stake Through the Heart | first=Cassell | last=Bryan-Low | date=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalalchemy.tv/2008/03/joseph-lewis-lost-1-billion-in-bear.html|title=Joseph Lewis: "I Lost $1 Billion in Bear Stearns"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitchells &amp; Butlers===
{{main|Mitchells &amp; Butlers}}
Lewis is the largest shareholder in the British [[public house]] group Mitchells &amp; Butlers, controlling 26.85% of the issued share capital through his investment vehicle Piedmont, which he built up since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/18/mitchells-butlers-no-one-to-call-time | author=Jenny Davey | accessdate=24 September 2011 | work=The Guardian | title=Mitchells &amp; Butlers: the giant pub company with no one to call 'time' | location=London | date=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jc-thn-ws3.thejc.com/business/alex-brummer-business/32817/joe-lewis-still-has-midas-touch The Jewish Chronicle: "Joe Lewis still has that midas touch" by Alex Brummer] 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported on 27 August 2011 that Lewis had made a zero premium proposal for the pub group of 224p a share. He later revealed on 12 September 2011 that he was considering raising his earlier offer to 230p a share, a 4.5% premium. However, independent M&amp;B board members rejected the offer as "significantly undervaluing" the business.

==Personal life==
Lewis has been married twice. 
His first marriage to Esther Browne ended in divorce. They had two children: 
Vivienne Lewis Silverton is seen as his "heir"&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt; and serves on Tavistock's board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tavistock.com/team/ Tavistock Website: Board of Directors] retrieved 8 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityam.com/the-capitalist/harriet-dennys/joe-lewis-clan-bears-his-fourth-generation City AM: "JOE LEWIS CLAN BEARS HIS FOURTH GENERATION" by HARRIET DENNYS] 23 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; She is divorced from Toby Silverton, the former chairman of [[Bristol Cars]], once fully owned by Tavistock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristolcars.co.uk/past/#2 Britol Cars: "The end of the second era - 1997-2011"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310235540/http://www.bristolcars.co.uk/past/ |date=10 March 2013 }} retrieved 31 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/11/bristol-cars-exclusive-anonymity/ New York Times: "Bristol Cars: Exclusive Anonymity" By NICK KURCZEWSKI] 11 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Undefined-Headline/story-11237972-detail/story.html This Is Bristol: "Bristol Cars - Memorable Motors" by Gerry Brook] 8 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5030">&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Juanvaldezcr.jpg|thumb|right|A sticker seen on an espresso machine in the coffee growing regions of Costa Rica.]] --&gt;'''Juan Valdez drinks Costa Rican coffee''' ({{lang-es|Juan Valdez bebe café de Costa Rica}}) is a [[slogan]], implying that [[Juan Valdez]], a [[fictional character]] created by the [[Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia]] (Fedcafé), drinks [[coffee]] from [[Costa Rica]]. In Costa Rica, the slogan is popular on [[bumper stickers]].&lt;ref&gt;Costa Rica Tourism and Travel Bureau. February 24, 2006. "[http://www.rainforesttours.com/general.htm Costa Rica General Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229232219/http://www.rainforesttours.com/general.htm |date=December 29, 2006}}."&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan prompted a lawsuit for the first time in 2006, when Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia sued [[Café Britt]] following a t-shirt dispute.

==History==  	 
The origins of the slogan are unclear. [[Juan Valdez]] has appeared in advertisements for [[Colombia]]n coffee since 1959. [[Jaime Daremblum]], then-[[Foreign relations of Costa Rica|Costa Rican ambassador to the United States]], used the phrase in a 1999 speech.&lt;ref name="amcostarica"&gt;''A.M. Costa Rica''. May 11, 2006. "[http://www.amcostarica.com/051106.htm Colombians finally react to Juan Valdez joke]." Vol. 6. No. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; 	 
 		 
[[File:Juan Valdez drink costa rican coffe.JPG|thumb|right|A license plate frame featuring the slogan]]Apparently the message about Juan Valdez as a drinker of Costa Rican coffee was attributed to José Duval, a New York-based actor, who was the first Juan Valdez.&lt;ref name="amcostarica"/&gt;

==Legal disputes==
In 2006, The Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia received an injunction preventing the Costa Rican company Café Britt from selling [[t-shirt]]s with the slogan. Fedcafé then filed a $1 million lawsuit on July 7, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;VolCafe Specialty Coffee. July 7, 2006. "[http://www.volcafespecialty.com/CoffeeNews_Archives/CoffeeNews%20July%203-7,%202006v2.pdf Colombian Fedcafe files lawsuit against Costa Rican roaster]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}."&lt;/ref&gt; after Café Britt refused to sign a contract, stating that it must respect the [[intellectual property]] of Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia and refrain from using either the name or image of Juan Valdez. Café Britt filed a $200,000 counter-suit, after producing an [[affidavit]] from a Costa Rican man, Juan Valdez, certifying that ''he'' does drink Costa Rican coffee. Café Britt also argued that the phrase is so common as to be ineligible for legal protection.&lt;ref&gt;Costa Rican Vacations, UK. November 2006. "[http://www.costaricaholiday.co.uk/News/November.htm Coffee Character Chaos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008183111/http://www.costaricaholiday.co.uk/News/November.htm |date=October 8, 2007}}."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Blake. November 18, 2006. "[http://www.aboutcoffee.net/2006/11/juan-valdez-drinks-costa-rican-coffee.html Juan Valdez drinks Costa Rican Coffee]." ''Tico Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fedcafé maintains that Café Britt agreed in early 2006 to stop using its trademarks;&lt;ref name="amcostarica"/&gt; Pablo Vargas, the manager of Café Britt, denies that such an agreement existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{es_icon}} ''Nacion''. May 11, 2006. "[http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2006/mayo/11/economia2.html  Cafeteros colombianos y Britt se enfrentan por 'Juan Valdez']."&lt;/ref&gt;  
The only and final agreement, according to Fedcafé's proposal of January 19, 2006, consisted in the total recall of the t-shirts.  This is the agreement Britt accepted and executed on that same date.  In exchange, Fedcafé committed to dismiss any further legal process.&lt;ref&gt;{{es_icon}} ''Nacion''. January 13, 2007. "[http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/enero/13/economia889464.html Britt demanda a Federación colombiana por difamación]."&lt;/ref&gt;  

The "other" Juan Valdez was discovered as early as 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Van Wik, Anika. December 22, 1999. "Colourful Costa Rican Poas Volcano is just one of the spectacular sights in this Central American country." ''Calgary Sun''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Café Britt presented a criminal case against Gabriel Silva, Federacafé's manager, for presumably defamatory statements, as well as taking civil action against him for damages of $1,000,000. Mr. Silva was notified in Colombia through diplomatic channels.  All charges have since been dropped.  When asked to comment, Silva's lawyer, Kyle Hoskinson, stated, "I'm glad this is all over."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.portafolio.co/economia/finanzas/sigue-polemica-britt-federacafe-313470 |title=Sigue polémica Britt-Federacafé |trans-title=Britt-Federacafé Still Controversial |website=Portafolio |language=Spanish |date=March 6, 2007 |access-date=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Laurentius saga''''' (modern Icelandic ''Lárentíus saga'') is an [[Icelandic Saga]], written in the third quarter of the fourteenth century, describing the life of [[List of Hólar bishops|Icelandic bishop]] [[Lárentíus Kálfsson|Laurentius Kálfsson]], thus covering the period 1267–1331.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Ruth Sigurdson, 'The Church in Fourteenth-Century Iceland: Ecclesiastical Administration, Literacy, and the Formation of an Elite Clerical Identity' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, University of Leeds, 2011), p. 47, http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/2610/ https://academia.edu/1795158/The_Church_in_Fourteenth-Century_Iceland&lt;/ref&gt; The presumed author, [[Einarr Hafliðason]], was a student and friend of Laurentius.&lt;ref&gt;Neijmann (2007) 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Although incomplete, ''Laurentius saga'' is considered to be one of the best written of the early Icelandic biographies, as well as being an important source of information about the teaching and education methods of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Neijmann (2007) 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be seen as one of the products of the [[North Icelandic Benedictine School]].

The saga is preserved primarily in two vellum manuscripts containing different versions of the saga: A (Reykjavík, Stofnun Árna Magnússonar, AM 406 a I 4to), written in [[Hólar]] around 1530, possibly by síra Tómas Eiríksson; and B (Reykjavík, Stofnun Árna Magnússonar, AM 180 b fol.), also written in Hólar, this time around 1500. The sagas contain slightly different information, suggesting that both have shortened an earlier version somewhat, but of the two B seems to be the shorter. Both have missing pages and must to some extent be supplemented from Þ (Reykjavík, Stofnun Árna Magnússonar, AM 404 4to), copied by Jón Pálsson at the behest of Þórlákur Skúlason, the bishop of Hólar, around 1640, when the manuscripts were more complete. This mostly copies B but another of Þórlákur's scribes, Brynjólfur Jónsson, filled in the gaps from A.&lt;ref&gt;Guðrún Ása Grímsdóttir (ed.), ''Biskupa sögur III: Árna saga biskups, Lárentius saga biskups, Söguþáttr Jóns Halldórssonar biskups, Biskupa ættir'', Íslenzk fornrit, 17 (Reykjavík: Hið Íslenzka fornritfélag, 1998), lviii-lix.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leopard Spotted Horses''' appear in [[Paleolithic]] [[cave paintings]]. These paintings depict white, spotted horses and experts cannot agree if they depict real or imagined animals. The difference is of importance as it would reveal tendencies to either realism or creativity in early human art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/2011/11/08/cave-painters-didnt-dream-up-spotted-horses-study-shows/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110200714/http://www.history.com/news/2011/11/08/cave-painters-didnt-dream-up-spotted-horses-study-shows/ |archivedate=2011-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/science/spotted-horses-in-cave-art-werent-just-a-figment-dna-shows.html|title=Spotted Horses in Cave Art Weren’t Just a Figment, DNA Shows|date=8 November 2011|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of [[DNA]] in horse fossils of similar date to the paintings show the presence of the [[Leopard complex]] gene, which could result in the coat patterns shown in the caves.&lt;ref name="pnas"&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/11/02/1108982108.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-11-ancient-dna-insights-cave-horses.html|title=Ancient DNA provides new insights into cave paintings of horses|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Cave paintings===
[[File:Pech Merle cave leopard spotting.JPG|thumb|Pech Merle cave horses with leopard spotting]]
Ancient cave paintings began emerging roughly 35,000 years ago and are found often in remote locations around the world. According to various carbon dating tests, roughly 25,000 years ago, a cave painting depicting spotted horses was painted in [[Pech Merle]] cave in France. European cave paintings often depict rhinoceros, wild cattle and other types of game, but the spotted horses depicted seem to indicate that the species existed 20,000 years prior to their domestication, some 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bikyamasr.com/47944/new-studies-indicate-spotted-horses-have-existed-for-35000-years/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109214951/http://bikyamasr.com/47944/new-studies-indicate-spotted-horses-have-existed-for-35000-years/ |archivedate=2012-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Leopard Complex===

The coat patterns in horses are genetically-related and are called a [[leopard complex]]. The genes in leopard complex are also linked to abnormalities in the eyes and vision. These patterns are most closely identified with the [[Appaloosa]] horse breed, though its presence in breeds from Asia to western Europe has indicated that it is due to a very ancient mutation.

===Evidence===
Until now, scientists only had DNA evidence of monochrome horses - mainly bay and black - living in Europe in that period, and had therefore assumed that the spots had a shamanistic or spiritual significance – or were simply the artistic license of an imaginative caveman. With past research of ancient DNA only turning up evidence of brown and black horses as seen painted in the Lascaux Cave and Chauvet Cave, scientists wondered if the spotted horses seen in other caves such as Pech Merle, with it paintings of white horses with black spots, were real or fantasy,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cavingnews.com/20111108-new-study-confirms-early-cave-painters-were-realists-lascaux-chauvet-pech-merle|title=New Study Confirms Early Cave Painters were Realists|work=Caving News}}&lt;/ref&gt; New DNA evidence gathered and analyzed by an international team of researchers has found that spotted horses did indeed exist in Europe in what is known as the Upper Paleolithic period, 50,000 to 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="dw-world"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15517588,00.html|title=Pech Merle horses really were spotted, scientists say|work=DW.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries==
===The Dappled Horses of Pech Merle===
The approximately 25,000-year-old paintings "The Dappled Horses of [[Pech Merle]]" depict spotted horses on the walls of a [[cave]] in [[France]] remarkably similar to a pattern known as "[[leopard]]" in modern horses such as [[Appaloosas]]. [[Horses]] were popular among [[Stone Age]] artists, found in most [[cave paintings]] that have recognizable animals in them, commonly in a [[caricature]] form that slightly exaggerates the most typical "horsey" features, such as their manes of hair.

Until now, ancient [[DNA analyses]] suggested horses during the Stone Age were only black or bay colored with no evidence for white-spotted patterns. This hinted that cave paintings of leopard-patterned horses were fantasy, not accurate portrayals. Some have proposed that drawings of imaginary animals might have had some kind of symbolic or even religious value.

Research now suggests those paintings might actually have been based on the real-life appearance of the animals.

Scientists investigated the differences in [[genes]] for coat color of 31 ancient horse [[fossils]] from [[Siberia]], Eastern and Western [[Europe]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The researchers found that a [[genetic mutation]] associated with the presence of white leopard-like spotting patterns on modern horses was present in six of the European horse fossils. Additionally, seven of the fossils had the [[genetic variation]] for black coat color, whereas 18 had bay coats.

All horse color phenotypes that seem to be distinguishable in cave paintings have now been found to exist in prehistoric horse populations, suggesting that cave paintings of this species represent remarkably realistic depictions of the animals shown. This finding lends support to hypotheses arguing that cave paintings might have contained less of a symbolic or transcendental connotation than often assumed.&lt;ref name="pnas"/&gt; Still, although these horses might not have been imaginary but cannot be excluded that the paintings had not have any religious value.&lt;ref name="dw-world"/&gt;

==Future research==
Leopard-spotted patterns in modern horses are sometimes linked with [[congenital]] problems such as stationary [[night blindness]], perhaps explaining why any [[wild horse]]s with them eventually died out long ago. As to why so many other horse fossils were found with them in the first place, perhaps this patterning provided [[camouflage]] in the snowy environments of the [[Stone Age]], was attractive to mates or just stuck around due to random chance.

It is difficult to judge how common the spotted horses were, based on the handful of samples tested, but there may be evidence that they were "not rare." This is also a new insight, since many researchers had considered a spotted coat unlikely for Paleolithic horses. The ability to genotype Stone Age animals is a relatively new tool for archeologists, and it is possible to gain more knowledge about the appearance of these animals.&lt;ref name="dw-world"/&gt;

==History==
On May 8, 1902, the Actors Fund opened a home for retired entertainers on [[Staten Island]], a [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

In 1928, the [[Government of New York City|New York City government]] took the property using [[eminent domain]] to enlarge an adjacent city park. That year, the residents were moved to the former mansion of American businesswoman [[Hetty Green]] in Englewood.&lt;ref name=fund/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New Jersey –  A Guide to the State |author=Westergaard, Barbara |page=95 |location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |year=2006 | isbn = 978-0-813-51242-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mansion was razed in 1959, and a modern facility was erected in 1961.

In 1975, the facility was merged with the Percy Williams Home on [[Long Island]], New York.

The facilities were expanded in 1988 with a 50-bed [[nursing home]]. In the same year, the [[Edwin Forrest]] wing was created at the nursing home after a merger with the Edwin Forrest Home in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].

In 1993, a wing was named in honor of actress [[Natalie Schafer]], notable for her role as [[Lovey Howell|Eunice "Lovey" Wentworth Howell]] on the television [[sitcom]] ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' (1964&amp;ndash;1967), who left $1.5 million to the Actors Fund after her death.&lt;ref name=fund/&gt;

In 2003, it was named in honor of Lillian Booth, a philanthropist who donated $2 million to the facility.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Andrew H. (November 5, 1991).

Retrieved August 17, 2012.  "The home here was renamed for the philanthropist Lillian Booth just last spring, after she presented it a $2 million gift. Mrs. Booth, not a part of the Booth theatrical family, is the widow of Ferris Booth, a private investment counselor and heir to an I.B.M. fortune."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The London Sketch Club''' was founded by members of the Langham Sketching Club on 1 April 1898 as a social club for artists working in the field of commercial graphic art, mainly for newspapers, periodicals and books.  The founder members were [[Dudley Hardy]], [[Phil May (caricaturist)|Phil May]], Walter Fowler, [[Lance Thackeray]], [[Cecil Aldin]], W Sanders Fiske, Walter Churcher, [[Tom Browne (illustrator)|Tom Browne]], [[George Charles Haité]], its first president, and [[Frederick Hamilton Jackson]], its first Honorary Secretary. By 1903, it had established itself in permanent premises in Wells Street. However, the club relocated to 7 Dilke Street in 1957. Members still meet each other there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/london-sketch-club|title=London Sketch Club {{!}} Artist Biographies|website=www.artbiogs.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15520">'''Maternal death in fiction''' is a common theme encountered in literature, movies, and other media.

The death of a mother during [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]] or [[Postnatal|puerperium]] is a tragic event. The chances of a child surviving such an extreme birth are compromised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://apha.confex.com/apha/131am/techprogram/paper_62489.htm | author=Uhler SA | title=Impact of a mother’s death on child health and survival in Haiti | date=November 13, 2003 | accessdate=August 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fictional literature the death of a pregnant or delivering mother is a powerful device: it removes one character and places the surviving child into an often hostile environment which has to be overcome. 

==Literature==

===19th century===
*In the [[Grimm Brothers]]' ''[[Snow White]]'', Snow White's mother died in childbirth. Soon afterwards, her father took a new wife who was beautiful, but very vain, and who possessed supernatural powers.
* In [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'', Liza Bolkonskaya, wife of [[Andrey Nikolayevich Bolkonsky|Prince Andrei]] dies giving birth to a son called Nikolai.
* In [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' the title character's mother, Agnes, dies giving birth to him.
* Another Dickens novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', Scrooge's younger sister Fan dies in childbirth giving birth to his nephew Fred. Scrooge's father blames him for his mother also dying in childbirth.
* In the 1891 play ''[[Spring Awakening (play)|Spring Awakening]]'' by [[Frank Wedekind]] and the same-named contemporary [[Spring Awakening (musical)|musical]] Wendla dies from a botched [[abortion]].
* In [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'', the author ridicules the convention of heroines having mothers who die in childbirth, by beginning the novel: "No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine. Her situation in life, the character of her father and mother... were all equally against her... Her mother was a woman of useful plain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a good constitution. She had three sons before Catherine was born; and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody might expect, she still lived on."
* In [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'',  [[Catherine Earnshaw]] goes into early labor and dies after giving birth to her daughter, [[Catherine Linton]].
* In Elizabeth Gaskell's'' [[Mary Barton]]'', when the heroine is a young girl, her mother dies in childbirth along with the baby, deeply affected by the grief of her sister Esther's disappearance, leaving Mary to be brought up by her father.
* Fanny Robin in Thomas Hardy's ''[[Far From the Madding Crowd]]'' also dies in childbirth along with the child, who was fathered by Frank Troy, Bathsheba's husband.
* In Henry James' ''[[Washington Square (novel)|Washington Square]]'', Catherine Sloper's mother dies shortly after her birth and the death of his beautiful and talented wife permanently alters Dr Sloper and causes him to be cold and unfeeling towards Catherine.
* Lucetta Farfrae (formerly Lucette Le Sueur) in Thomas Hardy's ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' has a miscarriage and dies, following a seizure induced by the public revelation of her love affair with Michael Henchard.

===20th century===

In [[visual arts]], [[Minimal music|music]], and other mediums, '''minimalism''' is an [[art movement]] that began in post–[[World War II]] Western art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with minimalism include [[Donald Judd]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Anne Truitt]], and [[Frank Stella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10459 |title=Christopher Want, ''Minimalism'', Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minimalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-minimalism.htm|title=Minimalism|publisher=theartstory.org|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the reductive aspects of [[modernism]] and is often interpreted as a reaction against [[abstract expressionism]] and a bridge to [[Postminimalism|postminimal]] art practices.

[[Minimalist music|Minimalism in music]] often features repetition and iteration such as those of the compositions of [[La Monte Young]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Julius Eastman]], and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]. The term ''minimalist'' often colloquially refers to anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials. It has accordingly been used to describe the [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[novel]]s of [[Samuel Beckett]], the films of [[Robert Bresson]], the stories of [[Raymond Carver]], and the automobile designs of [[Colin Chapman]]. &lt;!--The word was first used in English in the early 20th century to describe a 1915 composition by the Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], ''[[Black Square (painting)|Black Square]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013.

Minimalism in visual art, generally referred to as "minimal art", "literalist art"&lt;ref&gt;Fried, M. "Art and Objecthood", ''Artforum'', 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and "ABC Art"&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Barbara. "ABC Art", ''Art in America'' 53, no. 5 (October–November 1965): 57–69.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged in New York in the early 1960s as new and older artists moved toward [[geometric abstraction]]; exploring via painting in the cases of [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Robert Ryman]] and others; and sculpture in the works of various artists including [[David Smith (artist)|David Smith]], [[Anthony Caro]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Donald Judd]] and others. Judd's sculpture was showcased in 1964 at [[Green Gallery]] in Manhattan, as were Flavin's first fluorescent light works, while other leading Manhattan galleries like [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] and [[Pace Gallery]] also began to showcase artists focused on geometric abstraction. In addition there were two seminal and influential museum exhibitions: ''[[Primary Structures]]: Younger American and British Sculpture'' shown from April 27 – June 12, 1966 at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]], organized by the museum's Curator of Painting and Sculpture, Kynaston McShine&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, June 3, 1966, "Engineer's Esthetic", pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'' magazine, May 16, 1966, "The New Druids", pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Systemic Painting,'' at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]] also in 1966 that showcased [[Geometric abstraction]] in the American art world via [[Shaped canvas]], [[Color Field]], and [[Hard-edge painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/72 |title=''Systemic Painting'', Guggenheim Museum |publisher=Guggenheim.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/systemic-art |title=Systemic art, Oxford-Art encyclopedia |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of those exhibitions and a few others the art movement called ''minimal art'' emerged.

In a more broad and general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s of painters associated with the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of Kazimir Malevich, [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the [[De Stijl]] movement, and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivist]] movement, and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artcritical.com/2004/10/01/albert-york-and-giorgio-morandi/ |title=Maureen Mullarkey, Art Critical, ''Giorgio Morandi'' |publisher=Artcritical.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hr-5GcN0F6kC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Constantin+Br%C3%A2ncu%C5%9Fi.+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8fdrAkynIx&amp;sig=_wMpgr2P-ywVUMWpAziTWIuQnjI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mRHeTr_IF6jg0QHZ55XHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Daniel Marzona, Uta Grosenick; ''Minimal art'', p.12 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein had painted [[Monochrome painting|monochromes]] as early as 1949, and held the first private exhibition of this work in 1950—but his first public showing was the publication of the [[Artist's book]] ''[[Yves: Peintures]]'' in November 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Weitemeier, ''Yves Klein, 1928–1962: International Klein Blue'', Original-Ausgabe (Cologne: Taschen, 1994), 15. {{ISBN|3-8228-8950-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Paint Uncovered|chapter=Restoring the Immaterial: Study and Treatment of Yves Klein's ''Blue Monochrome (IKB42)''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Josef Albers]], and the works of artists as diverse as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], and others. Minimalism was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]] that had been dominant in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=abstract+expressionism+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NddevTB5zD&amp;sig=nyIwlEqV3XyQaTkeVPgZNqfOGUY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rBfeTtKeI8Pd0QG20am2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abstract%20expressionism%20and%20minimal%20art&amp;f=false |title=Gregory Battcock, ''Minimal Art: a critical anthology'', pp 161–172 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist and critic [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]] noted in his 1981 [[Artforum]] essay ''Last Exit: Painting,'' minimalism did not reject [[Clement Greenberg]]'s claims about modernist painting's&lt;ref name="sharecom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html |title=Clement Greenberg, ''Modernist Painting,'' 1960 |publisher=Sharecom.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduction to surface and materials so much as take his claims literally. According to Lawson, minimalism was the result, even though the term "minimalism" was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it, and many practitioners of art designated minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such. Also taking exception to this claim was Clement Greenberg himself; in his 1978 postscript to his essay ''Modernist Painting'' he disavowed this interpretation of what he said, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been some further constructions of what I wrote that go over into preposterousness: That I regard flatness and the inclosing of flatness not just as the limiting conditions of pictorial art, but as criteria of aesthetic quality in pictorial art; that the further a work advances the self-definition of an art, the better that work is bound to be. The philosopher or art historian who can envision me—or anyone at all—arriving at aesthetic judgments in this way reads shockingly more into himself or herself than into my article.&lt;ref name="sharecom"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to the previous decade's more subjective [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]], with the exceptions of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]]; minimalists were also influenced by composers [[John Cage]] and [[La Monte Young|LaMonte Young]], poet [[William Carlos Williams]], and the landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. They very explicitly stated that their art was not about self-expression, and unlike the previous decade's more subjective philosophy about art making theirs was 'objective'. In general, minimalism's features included [[Geometry|geometric]], often [[Cube|cubic]] forms purged of much [[metaphor]], equality of parts, [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], neutral surfaces, and industrial materials.

[[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], a theorist and artist, wrote a three part essay, "Notes on Sculpture 1–3", originally published across three issues of ''Artforum'' in 1966. In these essays, Morris attempted to define a conceptual framework and formal elements for himself and one that would embrace the practices of his contemporaries. These essays paid great attention to the idea of the [[wikt:Gestalt|gestalt]] – "parts... bound together in such a way that they create a maximum resistance to perceptual separation." Morris later described an art represented by a "marked lateral spread and no regularized units or symmetrical intervals..." in "Notes on Sculpture 4: Beyond Objects", originally published in ''Artforum'', 1969, continuing on to say that "indeterminacy of arrangement of parts is a literal aspect of the physical existence of the thing." The general shift in theory of which this essay is an expression suggests the transition into what would later be referred to as ''[[postminimalism]]''.

One of the first artists specifically associated with minimalism was the painter [[Frank Stella]], four of whose early "black paintings" were included in the 1959 show, ''[[Dorothy Miller#1959: Sixteen Americans|16 Americans]],'' organized by [[Dorothy Miller]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellas's black paintings were often determined by the dimensions of the lumber he used for stretchers to support the canvas, visible against the canvas as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side. Stella's decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a "given" feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint [[wikt:stripe|stripes]]. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently highly subjective and emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and, in terms of precedent among the previous generation of abstract expressionists, leaned more toward the less gestural, often somber, [[color field]] paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]]. Stella received immediate attention from the MoMA show, but other artists—including [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Robert Motherwell]], and [[Robert Ryman]]—had also begun to explore stripes, [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge painting|Hard-edge]] formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Britannica.com |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in minimal art to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal, there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including [[Jasper Johns]], Dan Flavin and [[Lee Bontecou]]. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oisteanu |first=Valery |url=http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman |title=Brooklynrail.org |publisher=Brooklynrail.org |date=2006-12-08 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

This movement was heavily criticized by modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some critics thought minimal art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried]], a formalist critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the minimal work of art, particularly minimal sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's [[participant Media|participation]] in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of minimal art. Fried's essay was immediately challenged by [[postminimalist]] and [[Land art|earth artist]] [[Robert Smithson]] in a letter to the editor in the October issue of Artforum. Smithson stated the following: "What Fried fears most is the [[consciousness]] of what he is doing—namely being himself theatrical."

In addition to the already mentioned [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Ryman]] and [[Donald Judd]] other minimal artists include: [[Robert Mangold]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Paul Mogensen]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[David Novros]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Jo Baer]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Patricia Johanson]], and [[Anne Truitt]].

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] nearly all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art:

''The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature.''&lt;ref&gt;in Barbara Rose, ed. ''Art as Art: The Selected Writings of Ad Reinhardt'' (New York: Viking Press, 1975):{{Page needed|date=November 2011}} {{ISBN|978-0-520-07670-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt's remark directly addresses and contradicts [[Hans Hofmann]]'s regard for nature as the source of his own abstract expressionist paintings. In a famous exchange between Hofmann and [[Jackson Pollock]] as told by [[Lee Krasner]] in an interview with Dorothy Strickler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm |title=Oral history interview with Lee Krasner, 1964 Nov. 2-1968 Apr. 11 – Oral Histories &amp;#124; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1964-11-02) for the Smithsonian Institution [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm |title=Lee Krasner, Archives of American Art |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Krasner's words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When I brought Hofmann up to meet Pollock and see his work which was before we moved here, Hofmann’s reaction was—one of the questions he asked Jackson was, "Do you work from nature?" There were no still lifes around or models around and Jackson’s answer was, "I am nature." And Hofmann’s reply was, "Ah, but if you work by heart, you will repeat yourself." To which Jackson did not reply at all. The meeting between Pollock and Hofmann took place in 1942.&lt;ref name="aaa"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term minimalism is also used to describe a trend in [[design]] and [[architecture]], wherein the subject is reduced to its necessary elements.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Minimalist architectural designers focus on the connection between two perfect planes, elegant lighting, and the void spaces left by the removal of three-dimensional shapes in an architectural design.{{according to whom|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} 

Minimalistic design has been highly influenced by [[Japanese architecture|Japanese traditional design and architecture]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The works of [[De Stijl]] artists are a major reference: De Stijl expanded the ideas of expression by meticulously organizing basic elements such as lines and planes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} With regard to home design, more attractive "minimalistic" designs are not truly minimalistic because they are larger, and use more expensive building materials and finishes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

There are observers who describe the emergence of minimalism as a response to the brashness and chaos of urban life. In Japan, for example, minimalist architecture began to gain traction in the 1980s when its cities experienced rapid expansion and booming population. The design was considered an antidote to the "overpowering presence of traffic, advertising, jumbled building scales, and imposing roadways."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Fractal Dimension of Architecture|last=Ostwald|first=Michael|last2=Vaughan|first2=Josephine|publisher=Birkhauser|year=2016|isbn=9783319324241|location=Newcastle|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chaotic environment was not only driven by urbanization, industrialization, and technology but also the Japanese experience of constantly having to demolish structures on account of the destruction wrought by World War II and the earthquakes, including the calamities it entails such as fire. The minimalist design philosophy did not arrive in Japan by way of another country as it was already part of the Japanese culture rooted on the Zen philosophy. There are those who specifically attribute the design movement to Japan's spirituality and view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Architecture of Minimalism|last=Cerver|first=Francisco|publisher=Arco|year=1997|isbn=9780823061495|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] (1886–1969) adopted the motto "Less is more" to describe his aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Philip Johnson]], op. cit.  A similar sentiment was conveyed by industrial designer Dieter Rams' motto, "Less but better."{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tactic was one of arranging the necessary components of a building to create an impression of extreme simplicity—he enlisted every element and detail to serve multiple visual and functional purposes; for example, designing a floor to also serve as the radiator, or a massive fireplace to also house the bathroom. Designer [[Buckminster Fuller]] (1895–1983) adopted the engineer's goal of "Doing more with less", but his concerns were oriented toward technology and engineering rather than aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Johnson]], ''Mies van der Rohe'', [[Museum of Modern Art]], 1947, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luis Barragán]] is an exemplary modern minimalist designer.{{According to whom|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Other contemporary minimalist architects include [[Kazuyo Sejima]], [[John Pawson]], [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], [[Álvaro Siza Vieira]], [[Tadao Ando]], [[Alberto Campo Baeza]], [[Yoshio Taniguchi]], [[Peter Zumthor]], [[Hugh Newell Jacobsen]], Vincent Van Duysen, [[Claudio Silvestrin]], [[Michael Gabellini]], and [[Gluckman Mayner Architects|Richard Gluckman]].&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006).

==Minimalist architecture and space==
Minimalist architecture became popular in the late 1980s in London and New York,&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–11.&lt;/ref&gt; where architects and fashion designers worked together in the boutiques to achieve simplicity, using white elements, cold lighting, large space with minimum objects and furniture.

===Concepts and design elements===
The concept of minimalist architecture is to strip everything down to its essential quality and achieve simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is not completely without ornamentation,&lt;ref name="Rossell"&gt;Rossell (2005), Minimalist Interiors, New York: HapperCollins. p6.&lt;/ref&gt; but that all parts, details, and joinery are considered as reduced to a stage where no one can remove anything further to improve the design.&lt;ref name="Pawson"&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The considerations for ‘essences’ are light, form, detail of material, space, place, and human condition.&lt;ref name="Bertoni15-16"&gt;Bertoni 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Minimalist architects not only consider the physical qualities of the building. They consider the spiritual dimension and the invisible, by listening to the figure and paying attention to  details, people, space, nature, and materials.,&lt;ref name="Bertoni21"&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; believing this reveals the abstract quality of something that is invisible and aids the search for the essence of those invisible qualities—such as natural light, sky, earth, and air. In addition, they "open a dialogue" with the surrounding environment to decide the most essential materials for the construction and create relationships between buildings and sites.&lt;ref name="Rossell"/&gt;

In minimalist architecture, design elements strive to convey the message of simplicity. The basic geometric forms, elements without decoration, simple materials and the repetitions of structures represent a sense of order and essential quality.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p8.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of natural light in buildings reveals simple and clean spaces.&lt;ref name="Bertoni15-16"/&gt; In the late 19th century as the arts and crafts movement became popular in Britain, people valued the attitude of ‘truth to materials’ with respect to the profound and innate characteristics of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. P.87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Minimalist architects humbly 'listen to figure,' seeking essence and simplicity by rediscovering the valuable qualities in simple and common materials.&lt;ref name="Bertoni21"/&gt;

===Influences from Japanese tradition===
{{see also|Japanese architecture}}

[[Image:RyoanJi-Dry garden.jpg|thumb|right|Ryōan-ji dry garden.The clay wall, which is stained by age with subtle brown and orange tones, reflects "wabi" and the rock garden "sabi", together reflecting the Japanese worldview or aesthetic of "[[wabi-sabi]]".&lt;ref&gt;森神逍遥 『侘び然び幽玄のこころ』桜の花出版、2015年 Morigami Shouyo, "Wabi sabi yugen no kokoro: seiyo tetsugaku o koeru joi ishiki" (Japanese) {{ISBN|978-4434201424}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]&lt;!-- The size of this image is specified because its default size is a bit too small considering the importance of the garden -- and the details can be more fully appreciated in an enlarged scale. --&gt;

The idea of simplicity appears in many cultures, especially the Japanese traditional culture of Zen Philosophy. Japanese manipulate the Zen culture into aesthetic and design elements for their buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p.85–97.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of architecture has influenced Western Society, especially in America since the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster (September 1953), Japanese Buildings in the United States before 1900: Their Influence upon American Domestic Architecture, The Art Bulletin, vol. 35, no. 3. p217–224.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it inspired the minimalist architecture in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Pawson"/&gt;

Zen concepts of simplicity transmit the ideas of freedom and essence of living.&lt;ref name="Pawson"/&gt; Simplicity is not only aesthetic value, it has a moral perception that looks into the nature of truth and reveals the inner qualities and essence of materials and objects.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p87.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[sand garden]] in [[Ryoanji]] temple demonstrates the concepts of simplicity and the essentiality from the considered setting of a few stones and a huge empty space.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese aesthetic principle of [[Ma (negative space)|Ma]] refers to empty or open space. It removes all the unnecessary internal walls and opens up the space. The emptiness of spatial arrangement reduces everything down to the most essential quality.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese aesthetic of [[Wabi-sabi]] values the quality of simple and plain objects.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p85.&lt;/ref&gt; It appreciates the absence of unnecessary features, treasures a life in quietness and aims to reveal the innate character of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Japanese floral art, also known as [[Ikebana]], has the central principle of letting the flower express itself. People cut off the branches, leaves and blossoms from the plants and only retain the essential part of the plant. This conveys the idea of essential quality and innate character in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1.p86.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, far from being just a spatial concept, Ma is ever-present in all aspects of Japanese daily life, as it applies to time as well as to daily tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wawaza.com/pages/when-less-is-more-the-concept-of-japanese-ma.html |title=When Less is More: the Concept of Japanese "MA" |publisher=Wawaza.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist architects and their works===
The Japanese minimalist architect, [[Tadao Ando]] conveys the Japanese traditional spirit and his own perception of nature in his works. His design concepts are materials, pure geometry and nature. He normally uses concrete or natural wood and basic structural form to achieve austerity and rays of light in space. He also sets up dialogue between the site and nature to create relationship and order with the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;96–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Ando’s works and the translation of Japanese aesthetic principles are highly influential on Japanese architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Japanese minimalist architect, [[Kazuyo Sejima]], works on her own and in conjunction with [[Ryue Nishizawa]], as [[SANAA]], producing iconic Japanese Minimalist buildings. Credited with creating and influencing a particular genre of Japanese Minimalism,&lt;ref&gt;Puglisi, L.P. (2008), New Directions in Contermporary Architecture, Chichester, John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Sejimas delicate, intelligent designs may use white color, thin construction sections and transparent elements to create the phenomenal building type often associated with minimalism. Works include [[New Museum]](2010) New York City, Small House (2000) Tokyo, House surrounded By Plum Trees (2003) Tokyo.

In Vitra Conference Pavilion, Weil am Rhein, 1993, the concepts are to bring together the relationships between building, human movement, site and nature. Which as one main point of minimalism ideology that establish dialogue between the building and site. The building uses the simple forms of circle and rectangle to contrast the filled and void space of the interior and nature. In the foyer, there is a large landscape window that looks out to the exterior. This achieves the simple and silence of architecture and enhances the light, wind, time and nature in space.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;18–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Pawson]] is a British minimalist architect; his design concepts are soul, light, and order. He believes that though reduced clutter and simplification of the interior to a point that gets beyond the idea of essential quality, there is a sense of clarity and richness of simplicity instead of emptiness. The materials in his design reveal the perception toward space, surface, and volume. Moreover, he likes to use natural materials because of their aliveness, sense of depth and quality of an individual. He is also attracted by the important influences from Japanese Zen Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin Klein Madison Avenue, New York, 1995–96, is a boutique that conveys Calvin Klein’s ideas of fashion. John Pawson’s interior design concepts for this project are to create simple, peaceful and orderly spatial arrangements. He used stone floors and white walls to achieve simplicity and harmony for space. He also emphasises reduction and eliminates the visual distortions, such as the air conditioning and lamps to achieve a sense of purity for interior.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alberto Campo Baeza]] is a Spanish architect and describes his work as essential architecture. He values the concepts of light, idea and space. Light is essential and achieves the relationship between inhabitants and the building. Ideas are to meet the function and context of space, forms, and construction. Space is shaped by the minimal geometric forms to avoid decoration that is not essential.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gasper House, Zahora, 1992 is a residence that the client wanted to be independent. High walls create the enclosed space and the stone floors used in house and courtyard show the continuality of interior and exterior. The white colour of the walls reveals the simplicity and unity of the building. The feature of the structure make lines to form the continuously horizontal house, therefore natural light projects horizontally through the building.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary minimalism==
Literary minimalism is characterized by an economy with words and a focus on surface description. Minimalist writers eschew adverbs and prefer allowing context to dictate meaning. Readers are expected to take an active role in creating the story, to "choose sides" based on oblique hints and innuendo, rather than react to directions from the writer.

Some 1940s-era crime fiction of writers such as [[James M. Cain]] and [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] adopted a stripped-down, matter-of-fact prose style to considerable effect; some classify this prose style as minimalism.{{Weasel inline|date=November 2011}}

Another strand of literary minimalism arose in response to the [[metafiction]] trend of the 1960s and early 1970s ([[John Barth]], [[Robert Coover]], and [[William H. Gass]]). These writers were also spare with prose and kept a psychological distance from their subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Minimalist writers, or those who are identified with minimalism during certain periods of their writing careers, include the following: [[Raymond Carver]], [[Ann Beattie]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[K. J. Stevens]], [[Amy Hempel]], [[Bobbie Ann Mason]], [[Tobias Wolff]], [[Grace Paley]], [[Sandra Cisneros]], [[Mary Robison]], [[Frederick Barthelme]], [[Richard Ford]], [[Patrick Holland (author)|Patrick Holland]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Alicia Erian]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

American poets such as [[Stephen Crane]], [[William Carlos Williams]], early [[Ezra Pound]], [[Robert Creeley]], [[Robert Grenier (poet)|Robert Grenier]], and [[Aram Saroyan]] are sometimes identified with their ''minimalist'' style. The term "minimalism" is also sometimes associated with the briefest of poetic genres, [[haiku]], which originated in Japan, but has been domesticated in English literature by poets such as [[Nick Virgilio]], [[Raymond Roseliep]], and [[George Swede]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The Irish writer [[Samuel Beckett]] is well known for his minimalist plays and prose, as is the Norwegian writer [[Jon Fosse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Paul|title=Samuel Beckett|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5161|website=Literary Encyclopedia|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''The Easy Chain'', [[Evan Dara]] includes a 60-page section written in the style of musical minimalism, in particular inspired by composer [[Steve Reich]]. Intending to represent the psychological state (agitation) of the novel's main character, the section's successive lines of text are built on repetitive and developing phrases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Minimal music==
{{main article|Minimal music}}

The term "minimal music" was derived around 1970 by [[Michael Nyman]] from the concept of minimalism, which was earlier applied to the [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name=Bernard93&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernard|first=Jonathan W.|title=The Minimalist Aesthetic in the Plastic Arts and in Music|journal=Perspectives of New Music|date=1993|volume=31|issue= 1 (Winter)|page=87|jstor=833043}}, citing Dan Warburton as his authority.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Warburton88&gt;{{cite web|last=Warburton|first=Dan|title=A Working Terminology for Minimal Music|url=http://www.paristransatlantic.com/magazine/archives/minimalism.html|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, it was in a 1968 review in ''The Spectator'' that Nyman first used the term, to describe a ten-minute piano composition by the Danish composer [[Henning Christiansen]], along with several other unnamed pieces played by [[Charlotte Moorman]] and [[Nam June Paik]] at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Nyman 1968, 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of 'music and emotion' seeks to understand the psychological relationship between human [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[music]]. It is a branch of [[music psychology]] with numerous areas of study, including the nature of emotional reactions to music, how characteristics of the listener may determine which emotions are felt, and which components of a musical composition or performance may elicit certain reactions. The field draws upon and has significant implications for such areas as [[philosophy]], [[musicology]], [[music therapy]], [[music theory]] and [[aesthetics]], as well the acts of [[musical composition]] and [[performance]].

==Philosophical approaches==

===Appearance emotionalism ===
Two of the most influential philosophers in the aesthetics of music are [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]] and [[Jerrold Levinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/music/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, S. (2005). "Artistic Expression and the Hard Case of Pure Music", in: Kieran, M. (Ed.), ''Contemporary Debates in Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art'': 179-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Davies calls his view of the expressiveness of emotions in music "appearance emotionalism", which holds that music expresses emotion without feeling it. Objects can convey emotion because their structures can contain certain characteristics that resemble emotional expression. "The resemblance that counts most for music's expressiveness ... is between music's temporally unfolding [[dynamic structure]] and configurations of human behaviour associated with the expression of emotion."&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2006, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The observer can note emotions from the listener's posture, gait, gestures, attitude, and comportment.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2006, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associations between musical features and emotion differ among individuals. Appearance emotionalism claims many listeners' perceiving associations constitutes the expressiveness of music.  Which musical features are more commonly associated with which emotions is part of [[music psychology]].  Davies claims that expressiveness is an objective property of music and not subjective in the sense of being projected into the music by the listener. Music's expressiveness is certainly response-dependent, i.e. it is realized in the listener's judgement.  Skilled listeners very similarly attribute emotional expressiveness to a certain piece of music, thereby indicating according to Davies (2006) that the expressiveness of music is somewhat objective because if the music lacked expressiveness, then no expression could be projected into it as a reaction to the music.

===The process theory===
The philosopher Jenefer Robinson&lt;ref&gt;Jenefer Robinson, Deeper than Reason: Emotion and its Role in Literature, Music, and Art, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005; pp. 310-13&lt;/ref&gt; assumes the existence of a mutual dependence between cognition and elicitation in her description of 'emotions as process, music as process' theory (or 'process' theory). Robinson argues that the process of emotional elicitation begins with an 'automatic, immediate response that initiates motor and autonomic activity and prepares us for possible action' causing a process of cognition that may enable listeners to 'name' the felt emotion. This series of events continually exchanges with new, incoming information. Robinson argues that emotions may transform into one another, causing blends, conflicts, and ambiguities that make impede describing with one word the emotional state that one experiences at any given moment; instead, inner feelings are better thought of as the products of multiple emotional 'streams'. Robinson argues that music is a series of simultaneous processes, and that it therefore is an ideal medium for mirroring such more 'cognitive' aspects of emotion as musical themes' 'desiring' resolution or leitmotif's mirrors memory processes. These simultaneous musical processes can reinforce or conflict with each other and thus also express the way one emotion 'morphs into another over time'.

==Conveying emotion through music==
The ability to perceive emotion in music is said to develop early in childhood, and improve significantly throughout development.&lt;ref name=Foundations&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dowling|first=W. J.|title=The development of music perception and cognition|journal=Foundations of Cognitive Psychology: Core Reading|year=2002|pages=481–502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity to perceive emotion in music is also subject to cultural influences, and both similarities and differences in emotion perception have been observed in cross-cultural studies.&lt;ref name="Susino and Schubert, 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susino|first=M.|author2=Schubert, S.|title=Cross-cultural anger communication in music: Towards a stereotype theory of emotion in music|journal=Musicae Scientiae|year=2017|pages=60–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=William Forde |last2=Balkwill |first2=Laura-Lee |editor1-last=Juslin |editor1-first=Patrik |editor2-last=Sloboda |editor2-first=John |title=Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, Applications |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2010 |pages=755–788 |chapter=Chapter 27: Cross-cultural similarities and differences | chapterurl=http://www.psy.mq.edu.au/me2/uploads/publications/27-Juslin__Sloboda-Ch-27.pdf|isbn=978-0-19-960496-8 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Empirical research has looked at which emotions can be conveyed as well as what structural factors in music help contribute to the perceived emotional expression. There are two schools of thought on how we interpret emotion in music. The [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists']] approach argues that music simply displays an emotion, but does not allow for the personal experience of emotion in the listener. [[Emotivism|Emotivists]] argue that music elicits real emotional responses in the listener.&lt;ref name=Chapter16&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scherer|first=K. R.|author2=Zentner, M. R.|title=Emotional effects of music: production rules|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=361–387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Radford&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radford|first=C.|title=Emotions and music: A reply to the cognitivists|journal=The Journal of Aesthestics and Art Criticism|year=1989|volume=47|pages=69–76|jstor=431994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the emotion experienced from a piece of music is a multiplicative function of  structural features, performance features, listener features and contextual features of the piece, shown as:

:''Experienced Emotion'' = ''Structural features'' × ''Performance features'' × ''Listener features'' × ''Contextual features''

where:

:''Structural features'' = Segmental features × Suprasegmental features
:''Performance features'' = Performer skill × Performer state
:''Listener features'' = Musical expertise × Stable disposition × Current motivation
:''Contextual features'' = Location × Event&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Structural features===
Structural features are divided into two parts, segmental features and suprasegmental features. Segmental features are the individual sounds or tones that make up the music; this includes acoustic structures such as [[Duration (music)|duration]], [[amplitude]], and [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. Suprasegmental features are the foundational structures of a piece, such as [[melody]], [[tempo]] and [[rhythm]].&lt;ref name="Chapter16" /&gt; There are a number of specific musical features that are highly associated with particular emotions.&lt;ref name="Chapter10"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gabrielle |first=A. |last2=Stromboli |first2=E. |title=The influence of musical structure on emotional expression |journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research |year=2001 |pages=223–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the factors affecting emotional expression in music, [[tempo]] is typically regarded as the most important, but a number of other factors, such as [[mode (music)|mode]], [[loudness]], and [[melody]], also influence the emotional valence of the piece.&lt;ref name="Chapter10"/&gt;

|}

===Performance features===
Performance features refers to the manner in which a piece of music is executed by the performer(s). These are broken into two categories, performer skills and performer state. Performer skills are the compound ability and appearance of the performer; including physical appearance, reputation and technical skills. The performer state is the interpretation, motivation, and stage presence of the performer.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

=== Listener features ===
Listener features refers to the individual and social identity of the listener(s). This includes their personality, age, knowledge of music, and motivation to listen to the music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Contextual features===
Contextual features are aspects of the performance such as the location and the particular occasion for the performance (i.e., funeral, wedding, dance).&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

These different factors influence expressed emotion at different magnitudes, and their effects are compounded by one another. Thus, experienced emotion is felt to a stronger degree if more factors are present. The order the factors are listed within the model denotes how much weight in the equation they carry. For this reason, the bulk of research has been done in structural features and listener features.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====Conflicting cues====
Which emotion is perceived is dependent on the context of the piece of music. Past research has argued that opposing emotions like happiness and sadness fall on a bipolar scale, where both cannot be felt at the same time.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=P. G.|author2=Schellenburg, E. G. |author3=Schimmack, U. |title=Feelings and perceptions of happiness and sadness induced by music: Similarities, differences, and mixed emotions|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|year=2010|volume=4|pages=47–56|doi=10.1037/a0016873}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has suggested that happiness and sadness are experienced separately, which implies that they can be felt concurrently.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt; One study investigated the latter possibility by having participants listen to computer-manipulated musical excerpts that have mixed cues between tempo and mode.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;   Examples of mix-cue music include a piece with major key and slow tempo, and a minor-chord piece with a fast tempo. Participants then rated the extent to which the piece conveyed happiness or sadness. The results indicated that mixed-cue music conveys both happiness and sadness; however, it remained unclear whether participants perceived happiness and sadness simultaneously or vacillated between these two emotions.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;   A follow up study was done to examine these possibilities. While listening to mixed or consistent cue music, participants pressed one button when the music conveyed happiness, and another button when it conveyed sadness.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt;  The results revealed that subjects pressed both buttons simultaneously during songs with conflicting cues.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsen|first=J. T.|author2=Stastny, B. J.|title=It's a bittersweet symphony: Simultaneously mixed emotional responses to music with conflicting cues|journal=Emotion|year=2011|doi=10.1037/a0024081|volume=11|pages=1469–1473}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings indicate that listeners can perceive  both happiness and sadness concurrently.  This has significant implications for how the structural features influence emotion, because when a mix of structural cues is used, a number of emotions may be conveyed.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt;

===Specific listener features===

====Development====
Studies indicate that the ability to understand emotional messages in music starts early, and improves throughout child development.&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sloboda|first=J. A.|author2=Juslin, P. N.|title=Psychological perspectives on music and emotion|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=79–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies investigating music and emotion in children primarily play a musical excerpt for children and have them look at pictorial expressions of faces. These facial expressions display different emotions and children are asked to select the face that best matches the music's emotional tone.&lt;ref name=Nawrot&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nawrot|first=E. S.|title=The Perception of Emotional Expression in Music: Evidence from Infants, Children and Adults|journal=Psychology of Music|date=1 January 2003|volume=31|issue=1|pages=75–92|doi=10.1177/0305735603031001325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mote&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mote|first=Jasmine|title=The effects of tempo and familiarity on children's affective interpretation of music.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2011|volume=11|issue=3|pages=618–622|doi=10.1037/a0022573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Terwogt&gt;{{cite journal|last=TERWOGT|first=MARK MEERUM|author2=VAN GRINSVEN, FLORA|title=RECOGNITION OF EMOTIONS IN MUSIC BY CHILDREN AND ADULTS|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|date=1 December 1988|volume=67|issue=3|pages=697–698|doi=10.2466/pms.1988.67.3.697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that children are able to assign specific emotions to pieces of music; however, there is debate regarding the age at which this ability begins.&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;

=====''Infants''=====
An infant is often exposed to a mother's speech that is musical in nature. It is possible that this motherly singing allows the mother to relay emotional messages to the infant.&lt;ref name=Trehub&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trehub|first=Sandra E.|author2=Nakata, Takayuki|title=Emotion and music in infancy|journal=Musicae Scientiae|year=2001|volume=SPEC ISSUE, 2001-2002|pages=37–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infants also tend to prefer positive speech to neutral speech as well as happy music to negative music.&lt;ref name=Nawrot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Trehub /&gt; It has also been posited that listening to their mother's singing may play a role in identity formation.&lt;ref name=Trehub /&gt; This hypothesis is supported by a study that interviewed adults and asked them to describe musical experiences from their childhood. Findings showed that music was good for developing knowledge of emotions during childhood.&lt;ref name=Vist&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vist|first=Torill|title=Music Experience in Early Childhood: Potential for Emotion Knowledge?|journal=International Journal of Early Childhood|date=16 November 2011|volume=43|issue=3|pages=277–290|doi=10.1007/s13158-011-0045-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Pre-school children''=====
These studies have shown that children at the age of 4 are able to begin to distinguish between emotions found in musical excerpts in ways that are similar to adults.&lt;ref name=Nawrot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mote /&gt; The ability to distinguish these musical emotions seems to increase with age until adulthood.&lt;ref name=Terwogt /&gt; However, children at the age of 3 were unable to make the distinction between emotions expressed in music through matching a facial expression with the type of emotion found in the music.&lt;ref name=Mote /&gt; Some emotions, such as anger and fear, were also found to be harder to distinguish within music.&lt;ref name=Terwogt /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robazza&gt;{{cite journal|last=ROBAZZA|first=CLAUDIO |author2=MACALUSO, CRISTINA |author3=D'URSO, VALENTINA|title=EMOTIONAL REACTIONS TO MUSIC BY GENDER, AGE, AND EXPERTISE|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|date=1 October 1994|volume=79|issue=2|pages=939–944|doi=10.2466/pms.1994.79.2.939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Elementary-age children''=====
In studies with four-year-olds and five-year-olds, they are asked to label musical excerpts with the affective labels "happy", "sad", "angry", and "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;  Results in one study showed that four-year-olds did not perform above chance with the labels "sad" and "angry", and the five-year-olds did not perform above chance with the label "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;  A follow-up study found conflicting results, where five-year-olds performed much like adults. However, all ages confused categorizing "angry" and "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;
Pre-school and elementary-age children listened to twelve short melodies, each in either major or minor mode, and were instructed to choose between four pictures of faces: happy, contented, sad, and angry.&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt; All the children, even as young as three years old, performed above chance in assigning positive faces with major mode and negative faces with minor mode.&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt;

====Personality effects====
Different people perceive events differently based upon their individual characteristics. Similarly, the emotions elicited by listening to different types of music seem to be affected by factors such as personality and previous musical training.&lt;ref name=Ladinig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladinig|first=Olivia|author2=Schellenberg, E. Glenn|title=Liking unfamiliar music: Effects of felt emotion and individual differences.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=2|pages=146–154|doi=10.1037/a0024671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schellenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schellenberg|first=E. Glenn|author2=Mankarious, Monika|title=Music training and emotion comprehension in childhood.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=887–891|doi=10.1037/a0027971|pmid=22642351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vuoskoski Measure"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vuoskoski|first=J. K.|author2=Eerola, T.|title=Measuring music-induced emotion: A comparison of emotion models, personality biases, and intensity of experiences|journal=Musicae Scientiae|date=13 July 2011|volume=15|issue=2|pages=159–173|doi=10.1177/1029864911403367}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with the personality type of agreeableness have been found to have higher emotional responses to music in general. Stronger sad feelings have also been associated with people with personality types of agreeableness and neuroticism. While some studies have shown that musical training can be correlated with music that evoked mixed feelings&lt;ref name=Ladinig /&gt;  as well as higher IQ and test of emotional comprehension scores,&lt;ref name=Schellenberg /&gt; other studies refute the claim that musical training affects perception of emotion in music.&lt;ref name=Robazza /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kratus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kratus|first=J.|title=A Developmental Study of Children's Interpretation of Emotion in Music|journal=Psychology of Music|date=1 January 1993|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–19|doi=10.1177/030573569302100101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also worth noting that previous exposure to music can affect later behavioral choices, schoolwork, and social interactions.&lt;ref name="Policy Statement"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Impact of Music, Music Lyrics, and Music Videos on Children and Youth|journal=Pediatrics|date=19 October 2009|volume=124|issue=5|pages=1488–1494|doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2145|pmid=19841124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, previous music exposure does seem to have an effect on the personality and emotions of a child later in their life, and would subsequently affect their ability to perceive as well as express emotions during exposure to music. Gender, however, has not been shown to lead to a difference in perception of emotions found in music.&lt;ref name=Robazza /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kratus /&gt;  Further research into which factors affect an individual's perception of emotion in music and the ability of the individual to have music-induced emotions are needed.

==Eliciting emotion through music==
Along with the research that music conveys an emotion to its listener(s), it has also been shown that music can produce emotion in the listener(s).&lt;ref name=Garrido&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrido|first=S.|author2=E. Shubert|title=Individual differences in the enjoyment of negative emotion in music: a literature review and experiment|journal=Music Perception|year=2011|volume=28|pages=279–295|doi=10.1525/MP.2011.28.3.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view often causes debate because the emotion is produced within the listener, and is consequently hard to measure. In spite of controversy, studies have shown observable responses to elicited emotions, which reinforces the Emotivists' view that music does elicit real emotional responses.&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;

===Responses to elicited emotion===
The structural features of music not only help convey an emotional message to the listener, but also may create emotion in the listener.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  These emotions can be completely new feelings or may be an extension of previous emotional events. Empirical research has shown how listeners can absorb the piece's expression as their own emotion, as well as invoke a unique response based on their personal experiences.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;

====''Basic emotions''====
In research on eliciting emotion, participants report personally feeling a certain emotion in response to hearing a musical piece.&lt;ref name=Garrido /&gt; Researchers have investigated whether the same structures that conveyed a particular emotion could elicit it as well. The researchers presented excerpts of fast tempo, major mode music and slow tempo, minor tone music to participants; these musical structures were chosen because they are known to convey happiness and sadness respectively.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  Participants rated their own emotions with elevated levels of happiness after listening to music with structures that convey happiness and elevated sadness after music with structures that convey sadness.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  This evidence suggests that the same structures that convey emotions in music can also elicit those same emotions in the listener.

In light of this finding, there has been particular controversy about music eliciting negative emotions. [[Cognitivism (psychology)|Cognitivists]] argue that choosing to listen to music that elicits negative emotions like sadness would be paradoxical, as listeners would not willingly strive to induce sadness.&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;  However, [[Emotivism|emotivists]] purport that music does elicit negative emotions, and listeners knowingly choose to listen in order to feel sadness in an impersonal way, similar to a viewer's desire to watch a tragic film.&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrido /&gt; The reasons why people sometimes listen to sad music when feeling sad has been explored by means of interviewing people about their motivations for doing so. As a result of this research it has indeed been found that people sometimes listen to sad music when feeling sad to intensify feelings of sadness. Other reasons for listening to sad music when feeling sad were; in order to retrieve memories, to feel closer to other people, for [[cognitive reappraisal]], to feel befriended by the music, to distract oneself, and for mood enhancement.&lt;ref name="Van den Tol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van den TOl|first=A.J.M.|author2=Edwards, J.|title=Exploring a rationale for choosing to listen to sad music when feeling sad. |journal=Psychology of Music|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Researchers have also found an effect between one's familiarity with a piece of music and the emotions it elicits.&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=S. O.|author2=Peynircioglu, Z. F.|title=Intensity of emotions conveyed and elicited by familiar and unfamiliar music|journal=Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal|year=2010|volume=27|pages=177–182|jstor=10.1525/mp.2010.27.3.177|doi=10.1525/MP.2010.27.3.177}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one study, half of participants were played twelve random musical excerpts one time, and rated their emotions after each piece. The other half of the participants listened to twelve random excerpts five times, and started their ratings on the third repetition. Findings showed that participants who listened to the excerpts five times rated their emotions with higher intensity than the participants who listened to them only once.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt; This suggests that familiarity with a piece of music increases the emotions experienced by the listener.

====''Emotional memories and actions''====
Music may not only elicit new emotions, but connect listeners with other emotional sources.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Music serves as a powerful cue to recall emotional memories back into awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Van den Tol, A. J. M., &amp;  Ritchie, T. D.(book-chapter in press). Emotion memory and music: A critical review and recommendations for future research.Music, Memory and Autobiography. (Eds: Professor Strollo Maria Rosaria and Dr. Romano Alessandra).&lt;/ref&gt; Because music is such a pervasive part of social life, present in weddings, funerals and religious ceremonies, it brings back emotional memories that are often already associated with it.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;  Music is also processed by the lower, sensory levels of the brain, making it impervious to later memory distortions. Therefore creating a strong connection between emotion and music within memory makes it easier to recall one when prompted by the other.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Music can also tap into empathy, inducing emotions that are assumed to be felt by the performer or composer. Listeners can become sad because they recognize that those emotions must have been felt by the composer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van | first1 =  | last2 = den Tol | first2 = A. J.

Listeners may also respond to emotional music through action.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Throughout history music was composed to inspire people into specific action - to march, dance, sing or fight. Consequently, heightening the emotions in all these events.  In fact, many people report being unable to sit still when certain rhythms are played, in some cases even engaging in subliminal actions when physical manifestations should be suppressed.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; Examples of this can be seen in young children's spontaneous outbursts into motion upon hearing music, or exuberant expressions shown at concerts.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;

====Juslin &amp; Västfjäll's BRECVEM model====

Juslin &amp; Västfjäll&lt;ref&gt;Patrik Juslin &amp; Daniel V ̈astfj ̈all, 'Emotional responses to music: The need to consider underlying mechanisms, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 31, 2008; 559-621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juslin, Liljeström, Västfjäll, &amp; Lundqvist. (2010). How does music evoke emotions? Exploring the underlying mechanisms. In P.N. Juslin &amp; J. Sloboda (Eds.), ''Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, and Applications'' (pp. 605-642). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; developed a model of seven ways in which music can elicit emotion, called the BRECVEM model.

''Brain Stem Reflex'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by music because one or more fundamental acoustical characteristics of the music are taken by the brain stem to signal a potentially important and urgent event. All other things being equal, sounds that are sudden, loud, dissonant, or feature fast temporal patterns induce arousal or feelings of unpleasantness in listeners...Such responses reflect the impact of auditory sensations – music as sound in the most basic sense.'

''Rhythmic Entrainment'':&lt;ref&gt;Juslin, P. (2011). Music and Emotion: seven questions, seven answers. In I. Deliège, J. Davidson, J. A. Sloboda (Eds.), ''Music and the Mind: Essays in Honour of John Sloboda'' (pp.113-138). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is evoked by a piece of music because a powerful, external rhythm in the music influences some internal bodily rhythm of the listener (e.g. heart rate), such that the latter rhythm adjusts toward and eventually 'locks in' to a common periodicity. The adjusted heart rate can then spread to other components of emotion such as feeling, through proprioceptive feedback. This may produce an increased level of arousal in the listener.'

''Evaluative Conditioning'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music simply because this stimulus has been paired repeatedly with other positive or negative stimuli. Thus, for instance, a particular piece of music may have occurred repeatedly together in time with a specific event that always made you happy (e.g., meeting your best friend). Over time, through repeated pairings, the music will eventually come to evoke happiness even in the absence of the friendly interaction.'

''Emotional Contagion'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music because the listener perceives the emotional expression of the music, and then "mimics" this expression internally, which by means of either peripheral feedback from muscles, or a more direct activation of the relevant emotional representations in the brain, leads to an induction of the same emotion.'

''Visual Imagery'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because he or she conjures up visual images (e.g., of a beautiful landscape) while listening to the music.'

''Episodic memory'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because the music evokes a memory of a particular event in the listener's life. This is sometimes referred to as the "Darling, they are playing our tune" phenomenon.'&lt;ref&gt;Davies, J. B. (1978). The psychology of music. Hutchinson.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Musical expectancy'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because a specific feature of the music violates, delays, or confirms the listener's expectations about the continuation of the music.'

====Musical expectancy====

With regards to violations of expectation in music several interesting results have been found. It has for example been found that listening to unconventional music may sometimes cause a meaning threat and result in compensatory behaviour in order to restore meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maher | first1 = P | last2 = Van Tilburg | first2 = W. A. P. | last3 = Van | first3 =  | last4 = den Tol | first4 = A. J.

====Aesthetic Judgement and BRECVEMA====

In 2013, Juslin created an additional aspect to the BRECVEM model called aesthetic judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Juslin | first1 = P. N. | year = 2013 | title = From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: towards a unified theory of musical emotions | url = | journal = Physics of Life Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 235–266 | doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2013.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the criteria which each individual has as a metric for music's aesthetic value. This can involve a number of varying personal preferences, such as the message conveyed, skill presented or novelty of style or idea.

==Comparison of conveyed and elicited emotions==

===Evidence for emotion in music===
There has been a bulk of evidence that listeners can identify specific emotions with certain types of music, but there has been less concrete evidence that music may elicit emotions.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  This is due to the fact that elicited emotion is subjective; and thus, it is difficult to find a valid criterion to study it.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Elicited and conveyed emotion in music is usually understood from three types of evidence: self-report, physiological responses, and expressive behavior. Researchers use one or a combination of these methods to investigate emotional reactions to music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Self-report''====
The self-report method is a verbal report by the listener regarding what they are experiencing. This is the most widely used method for studying emotion and has shown that people identify emotions and personally experience emotions while listening to music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Research in the area has shown that listeners' emotional responses are highly consistent. In fact, a meta-analysis of 41 studies on music performance found that happiness, sadness, tenderness, threat, and anger were identified above chance by listeners.&lt;ref name=Vieillard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vieillard|first=S.|author2=Peretz, I. |author3=Gosselin, N. |author4=Khalfa, S. |title=Happy, sad, scary, and peaceful musical excerpts for research on emotions|journal=Cognition and Emotion|year=2008|volume=4|pages=720–752|doi=10.1080/02699930701503567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study compared untrained listeners to musically trained listeners.&lt;ref name=Vieillard /&gt;  Both groups were required to categorize musical excerpts that conveyed similar emotions. The findings showed that the categorizations were not different between the trained and untrained; thus demonstrating that the untrained listeners are highly accurate in perceiving emotion.&lt;ref name=Vieillard /&gt; It is more difficult to find evidence for elicited emotion, as it depends solely on the subjective response of the listener. This leaves reporting vulnerable to self-report biases such as participants responding according to social prescriptions or responding as they think the experimenter wants them to.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  As a result, the validity of the self-report method is often questioned, and consequently researchers are reluctant to draw definitive conclusions solely from these reports.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Physiological responses''====
Emotions are known to create physiological, or bodily, changes in a person, which can be tested experimentally. Some evidence shows one of these changes is within the nervous system.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;   Arousing music is related to increased heart rate and muscle tension; calming music is connected to decreased heart rate and muscle tension, and increased skin temperature.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Other research identifies outward physical responses such as shivers or goose bumps to be caused by changes in harmony and tears or lump-in-the-throat provoked by changes in melody.&lt;ref name=Chapter19&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gabrielsson|first=A.|title=Emotion in strong experiences with music|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=431–449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers test these responses through the use of instruments for physiological measurement, such as recording pulse rate.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Expressive behavior''====
People are also known to show outward manifestations of their emotional states while listening to music. Studies using facial [[electromyography]] (EMG) have found that people react with subliminal facial expressions when listening to expressive music.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; In addition, music provides a stimulus for expressive behavior in many social contexts, such as concerts, dances, and ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; Although these expressive behaviors can be measured experimentally, there have been very few controlled studies observing this behavior.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Strength of effects===
Within the comparison between elicited and conveyed emotions, researchers have examined the relationship between these two types of responses to music. In general, research agrees that feeling and perception ratings are highly correlated, but not identical.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  More specifically, studies are inconclusive as to whether one response has a stronger effect than the other, and in what ways these two responses relate.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;

====''Conveyed more than elicited''====
In one study, participants heard a random selection of 24 excerpts, displaying six types of emotions, five times in a row.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt;  Half the participants described the emotions the music conveyed, and the other half responded with how the music made them feel. The results found that emotions conveyed by music were more intense than the emotions elicited by the same piece of music.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt; Another study investigated under what specific conditions strong emotions were conveyed. Findings showed that ratings for conveyed emotions were higher in happy responses to music with consistent cues for happiness (i.e., fast tempo and major mode), for sad responses to music with consistent cues for sadness (i.e., slow tempo and minor mode,) and for sad responses in general.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt; These studies suggest that people can recognize the emotion displayed in music more readily than feeling it personally.

====''Sometimes conveyed, sometimes elicited''====
Another study that had 32 participants listen to twelve musical pieces and found that the strength of perceived and elicited emotions were dependent on the structures of the piece of music.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;  Perceived emotions were stronger than felt emotions when listeners rated for arousal and positive and negative activation. On the other hand, elicited emotions were stronger than perceived emotions when rating for pleasantness.&lt;ref name=Kallenin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kallenin|first=K|author2=Ravaja, N.|title=Emotion perceived and emotion felt: Same and different|journal=Musicae Scientaie|year=2006|volume=10|pages=191–213|doi=10.1177/102986490601000203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Elicited more than conveyed''====
In another study analysis revealed that emotional responses were stronger than the listeners' perceptions of emotions.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;  This study used a between-subjects design, where 20 listeners judged to what extent they perceived four emotions: happy, sad, peaceful, and scared. A separate 19 listeners rated to what extent they experienced each of these emotions. The findings showed that all music stimuli elicited specific emotions for the group of participants rating elicited emotion, while music stimuli only occasionally conveyed emotion to the participants in the group identifying which emotions the music conveyed.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt; 
Based on these inconsistent findings, there is much research left to be done in order to determine how conveyed and elicited emotions are similar and different. There is disagreement about whether music induces 'true' emotions or if the emotions reported as felt in studies are instead just participants stating the emotions found in the music they are listening to.&lt;ref name=Schubert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Emery|title=Locus of emotion: The effect of task order and age on emotion perceived and emotion felt in response to music|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2007|volume=44|issue=4|pages=344–368|doi=10.1093/jmt/44.4.344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zentner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zentner|first=Marcel|author2=Grandjean, Didier |author3=Scherer, Klaus R. |title=Emotions evoked by the sound of music: Characterization, classification, and measurement.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2008|volume=8|issue=4|pages=494–521|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.8.4.494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music as a therapeutic tool==
{{Main|Music therapy}}
Music therapy as a therapeutic tool has been shown to be an effective treatment for various ailments. Therapeutic techniques involve eliciting emotions by listening to music, composing music or lyrics and performing music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keen MSocSc | first1 = Alexander W. | year = 2005 | title = Using Music as a Therapy Tool to Motivate Troubled Adolescents | url = | journal = Social Work in Health Care | volume = 39 | issue = 3–4| pages = 361–373 | doi = 10.1300/J010v39n03_09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Music therapy sessions may have the ability to help drug users who are attempting to break a drug habit, with users reporting feeling better able to feel emotions without the aid of drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Felicity A. | last2 = Gleadhill | first2 = Libby M. | last3 = Dingle | first3 = Genevieve A. | year = 2007 | title = Music therapy and emotional exploration: Exposing substance abuse clients to the experiences of non-drug-induced emotions | url = | journal = The Arts in Psychotherapy | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 321–330 | doi=10.1016/j.aip.2007.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music therapy may also be a viable option for people experiencing extended stays in a hospital due to illness. In one study, music therapy provided child oncology patients with enhanced environmental support elements and elicited more engaging behaviors from the child.&lt;ref name=Robb&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robb|first=Sheri L.|title=The effect of therapeutic music interventions on the behavior of hospitalized children in isolation: Developing a contextual support model of music therapy|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2000|volume=37|issue=2|pages=118–146|doi=10.1093/jmt/37.2.118}}&lt;/ref&gt; When treating troubled teenagers, a study by Keen revealed that music therapy has allowed therapists to interact with teenagers with less resistance, thus facilitating self-expression in the teenager.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
 
Music therapy has also shown great promise in individuals with autism, serving as an emotional outlet for these patients. While other avenues of emotional expression and understanding may be difficult for people with autism, music may provide those with limited understanding of socio-emotional cues a way of accessing emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heaton | first1 = Pam | year = 2009 | title = Music - shelter for the frazzled mind?". | url = | journal = The Psychologist | volume = 22 | issue = 12| pages = 1018–1020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Nikolaus Bernhard Leon Pevsner''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE|FBA}} (30 January 1902 – 18 August 1983) was a German, later British scholar of the [[history of art]], and especially that of [[history of architecture|architecture]].

Pevsner is best known for his 46-volume series of county-by-county guides, ''[[The Buildings of England]]'' (1951–74), often simply referred to by his surname.

==Life==
The son of a Russian-Jewish fur haulier, Nikolaus Pevsner was born in [[Leipzig]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]]. He attended the [[Thomasschule zu Leipzig|Thomas School]] and went on to study [[art history]] at the Universities of [[Leipzig]], Munich, Berlin, and [[Frankfurt]]/Main, completing a PhD in 1924 on the baroque merchant houses of Leipzig.{{sfn|Engel|2004|p=}} In 1923, he married Carola ("Lola") Kurlbaum, the daughter of distinguished Leipzig lawyer Alfred Kurlbaum.{{sfn|Games|2010|p=}} He worked as an assistant keeper at the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister|Dresden Gallery]] (1924–28).

During this period he became interested in establishing the supremacy of German modernist architecture after becoming aware of [[Le Corbusier]]'s Pavillon de l'Esprit Nouveau at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes|Paris Exhibition of 1925]].{{sfn|Games|2010|p=}}

In 1928 he contributed the volume on Italian baroque painting to the ''Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft'', a multi-volume series providing an overview of the history of European art. He taught at the [[University of Göttingen]] (1929–33), offering a specialist course on English art and architecture.

According to biographer Stephen Games, Pevsner welcomed many of the economic and cultural policies of the early [[Nazi Germany|Hitler regime]].{{sfn|Games|2010|p=}}{{sfn|Games|Pevsner|2002|p=}} However, due to [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|Nazi race laws]] he was forced to resign his lectureship in 1933.{{sfn|Harrison|2004|p=}} Later that year he moved to England, settling in [[Hampstead]], where poet [[Geoffrey Grigson]] was his neighbour in Wildwood Terrace.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Orbach, [https://www.mychippenham.org.uk/latest/73-nikolaus-pevsner-and-clyffe-pypard-by-julian-orbach "Nikolaus Pevsner and Clyffe Pypard"], ''My Chippenham''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Games, Stephen, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wpm1CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=pevsner%2Bgeoffrey+grigson%2Bwildwood+terrace&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3a_ywjHoMP&amp;sig=vdycIuQVA04Ea2MxyY2ZzXxeYrc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwivqK2jzvneAhUH7IMKHXalD7IQ6AEwAHoECC8QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pevsner%2Bgeoffrey%20grigson%2Bwildwood%20terrace&amp;f=false "3: Geoffrey Grigson"], ''Pevsner: The BBC Years: Listening to the Visual Arts'', Routledge, 2016, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. F. T. Baker, Diane K. Bolton and Patricia E. C. Croot, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol9/pp66-71 "Hampstead: North End, Littleworth, and Spaniard's End"], in C. R. Elrington (ed.),''A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 9, Hampstead, Paddington'', ed.  (London, 1989), pp. 66–71. British History Online. Retrieved 29 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Pevsner's first post was an 18-month research fellowship at the [[University of Birmingham]], found for him by friends in Birmingham and partly funded by the [[Council for Assisting Refugee Academics|Academic Assistance Council]].&lt;ref name="bham"&gt;{{cite news|title=A landlady in a million? Snapshots of days gone by|url=http://www.download.bham.ac.uk/buzz/Buzz_57.pdf|format=PDF|newspaper=Birmingham University online newspaper|issue=57|year=2005|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the role of the designer in the industrial process, the research produced a generally critical account of design standards in Britain which he published as ''An Enquiry into Industrial Art in England'' (Cambridge University Press, 1937). He was subsequently employed as a buyer of modern textiles, glass and ceramics for the [[Sydney Gordon Russell|Gordon Russell]] furniture showrooms in London.

By this time Pevsner had also completed ''Pioneers of the Modern Movement: from William Morris to Walter Gropius'', his influential pre-history of what he saw as [[Walter Gropius]]'s dominance of contemporary design. ''Pioneers'' ardently championed Gropius's first two buildings (both pre–First World War) on the grounds that they summed up all the essential goals of 20th-century architecture; in England, however, it was widely taken to be the history of England's contribution to international modernism, and a manifesto for [[Bauhaus]] (i.e. [[Weimar]]) modernism, which it was not.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In spite of that, the book remains an important point of reference in the teaching of the history of modern design, and helped lay the foundation of Pevsner's career in England as an architectural historian. Since its first publication by [[Faber &amp; Faber]] in 1936, it has gone through several editions and been translated into many languages. The English-language edition has also been renamed ''Pioneers of Modern Design''.

==Second World War==
Pevsner was "[[more German than the Germans]]" to the extent that he supported "[[Goebbels]] in his drive for 'pure' non-decadent German art".&lt;ref name="Pearman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hughpearman.com/pevsner-and-the-nazis-round-two-who-and-what-did-the-great-architectural-historian-want-to-be/ |newspaper=The Sunday Times|date= 28 March 2010 |title=Prepare to be Outraged|quote=Review of ''Pevsner – the Early Life'', by Stephen Games|via=hughpearman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reported as saying of the [[Nazis]] (in 1933) "I want this movement to succeed. There is no alternative but chaos.... There are things worse than [[Hitlerism]]".{{sfn|Games|2010|p=}} Nonetheless he was included in the Nazi [[The Black Book|Black Book]] as hostile to the Hitler regime.

In 1940, Pevsner was interned as an enemy alien in [[Huyton]], Liverpool. Geoffrey Grigson wrote in his ''Recollections'': "When at last two hard-faced Bow Street runners arrived in the eary hours of the morning to take [him] ... I managed, clutching my pyjama trousers, to catch them up with the best parting present I could quickly think of, which was an elegant little edition, a new edition, of Shakespeare's Sonnets."&lt;ref&gt;Grigson, Geoffrey, ''Recollections, Mainly of Writers and Artists'' (Hogarth Press, 1984) quoted in Harries 2011, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FjSKfNcjGUsC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;lpg=PA273&amp;dq=pevsner%2Bgeoffrey+grigson%2BShakespeare+Sonnets&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U2KBIeDxGE&amp;sig=yzkFHMIddSLUfbPQuClabtw3T0o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjxkoPF1PneAhUL_IMKHXgCA20Q6AEwC3oECBEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pevsner%2Bgeoffrey%20grigson%2BShakespeare%20Sonnets&amp;f=false p. 273].&lt;/ref&gt; Pevsner was released after three months on the intervention of, among others, [[Frank Pick]], then Director-General of the Ministry of Information. He spent some time in the months after [[the Blitz]] clearing bomb debris, and wrote reviews and art criticism for the Ministry of Information's ''[[Die Zeitung]]'', an anti-Nazi publication for Germans living in England. He also completed for [[Penguin Books]] the Pelican paperback ''An Outline of European Architecture'', which he had begun to develop while in internment. ''Outline'' would eventually go into seven editions, be translated into 16 languages, and sell more than half a million copies.

In 1942, Pevsner finally secured two regular positions. From 1936 onwards he had been a frequent contributor to the ''[[Architectural Review]]'' and from 1943 to 1945 he stood in as its acting editor while the regular editor [[James Maude Richards|J. M. Richards]] was on active service. Under the ''AR''{{'}}s influence, Pevsner's approach to modern architecture became more complex and more moderate.{{sfn|Pevsner|2010|p=}} Early signs of a lifelong interest in Victorian architecture, also influenced by the ''[[Architectural Review]]'', appeared in a series written under the pseudonym of "Peter F. R. Donner": Pevsner's "Treasure Hunts"  guided readers down selected London streets, pointing out architectural treasures of the 19th century. He was also closely involved with the ''Review''{{'}}s proprietor, [[H. de C. Hastings]], in evolving the magazine's theories on [[picturesque]] planning.{{sfn|Erten|2004|p=}}

In 1942, Pevsner was also appointed a part-time lecturer at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], London; he would eventually retire from the college in 1969 as its first professor of art history. He lectured at Cambridge for almost 30 years, having been [[Slade Professor of Fine Art|Slade professor]] there for a record six years from 1949 to 1955, and would also hold the Slade professorship at Oxford in 1968.

Framing all this was his career as a writer and editor. After moving to England, Pevsner had found that the study of architectural history had little status in academic circles, and the amount of information available, especially to travellers wanting to inform themselves about the architecture of a particular district, was limited. Invited by [[Allen Lane]], founder of [[Penguin Books]], for whom he had written his ''Outline'' and also edited the [[King Penguin Books|King Penguin series]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.booksandwriters.co.uk/writer/K/king-penguins.asp King Penguin], Books and Writers {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102070523/http://www.booksandwriters.co.uk/writer/K/king-penguins.asp |date=2 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to suggest ideas for future publications, he proposed a series of comprehensive county guides to rectify this shortcoming.

Work on the ''[[Buildings of England]]'' series began in 1945, and the first volume was published in 1951. Pevsner wrote 32 of the books himself and 10 with collaborators, with a further four of the original series written by others. Since his death, work has continued on the series, which has been extended to cover the rest of the United Kingdom, under the title [[Pevsner Architectural Guides]] (now published by [[Yale University Press]]).{{efn|For a history and bibliography of the Buildings of England series, see {{harvnb|Cherry|1998|p=}} }} After updating and correcting ''London 1: the Cities of London and Westminster'' for its reissue in 1962, Pevsner delegated the revision and expansion of further volumes to others, beginning with Enid Radcliffe for ''Essex'' (1965).{{sfn|Harries|2011|p=}} The gazetteer descriptions of revised volumes do not routinely distinguish between Pevsner's original text and any new writing, but more recent books sometimes supply his words in quotation when the revising author's judgement differs, where a building has since been altered, or where the old text is no longer topical.

As well as ''The Buildings of England'', Pevsner proposed the ''Penguin the Pelican History of Art'' series (1953– ), a multi-volume survey on the model of the German ''Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft'', which he would himself edit. Many individual volumes are regarded as classics.

==Postwar==
In 1946, Pevsner made the first of several broadcasts on the [[BBC Third Programme]], presenting nine talks in all up to 1950, examining painters and European art eras. By 1977 he had presented 78 talks for the BBC, including the [[Reith Lectures]] in 1955 – a series of six broadcasts, entitled ''The Englishness of English Art'',&lt;ref name="Reith"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Englishness of English Art: 1955 | last = Pevsner | first = Nikolaus | work = The Reith Lectures - BBC Radio 4 | date =  | accessdate = 6 December 2017 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9llv | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he explored the qualities of art which he regarded as particularly English, and what they said about the English national character.{{sfn|Games|Pevsner|2002|p=}} His [[A. W. Mellon Lectures]] in Fine Art at the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C., were published in 1976 as ''A History of Building Types''.{{sfn|Harries|2011|p=715}}

Pevsner was a founding member in 1957 of the [[Victorian Society]], the national charity for the study and protection of Victorian and Edwardian architecture and other arts. In 1964 he was invited to become its chairman, and steered it through its formative years, fighting alongside [[John Betjeman]], [[Hugh Casson]] and others to save houses, churches, railway stations and other monuments of the Victorian age. He served for ten years (1960–70) as a member of the National Advisory Council on Art Education (or Coldstream Committee), campaigning for art history to be a compulsory element in the curriculum of art schools. He was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1965 and awarded the Gold Medal of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 1967.{{sfn|Harries|2011|pp=672–3}}

Having assumed British citizenship in 1946, Pevsner was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1953 and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1969 "for services to art and architecture".

Pevsner also received an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate]] from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: Honorary Graduates|website=hw.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Pevsner died at home in Wildwood Terrace,&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wildwood Terrace|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/periodproperty/9821880/Homes-for-sale-with-blue-plaques.html?frame=2460166|publisher=''Daily Telegraph''|location=London|date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hampstead]], London, in August 1983.&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard |last=Waite|title=Pevsner honoured with blue plaque|date=6 November 2007|work=Architects' Journal|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/pevsner-honoured-with-blue-plaque/219615.article}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife predeceased him by 20 years.

His memorial service was held at the [[Church of Christ the King, Bloomsbury]], the following December, with the memorial address being given by [[Alec Clifton-Taylor]], a friend of 50 years. He is buried in the churchyard of St Peter, [[Clyffe Pypard]], in [[Wiltshire]]. His elder son, Dieter, was an editor at Penguin Books. His younger son, [[Tom Pevsner|Tom]], was a film producer and director who went on to work on several [[James Bond films]].

Although Pevsner oversaw the publication of the initial volumes of the Scottish, Welsh and Irish counterparts of ''The Buildings of England'' (and in each was credited as "Editor-in-Chief", "Founding Editor" and "Editorial Adviser" respectively) he did not write any of them. As with the revisions of his earlier works, many of these volumes were the work of several contributors. Coverage of the whole of Great Britain was completed in 2016, with the Irish series still in progress.

A fictionalised Pevsner appears in the 1998 novel ''[[The Spell (novel)|The Spell]]'' by [[Alan Hollinghurst]].

==Notable ideas and theories==

* "A bicycle shed is a building; [[Lincoln Cathedral]] is a piece of architecture. Nearly everything that encloses space on a scale sufficient for a human being to move in is a building; the term architecture applies only to buildings designed with a view to aesthetic appeal." From ''An Outline of European Architecture'', 1943.
* Pevsner also described the three ways aesthetic appeal could manifest itself in architecture: in a building's façade, the material volumes, or the interior.

'''''Paolo and Francesca da Rimini''''' is a [[watercolour]] by English artist and poet [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], painted in 1855 and currently housed at [[Tate Britain]].

==History==
Rossetti's real name was Charles Gabriel Dante Rossetti, but his admiration for the great Florentine poet led him to change it to Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and he proceeded to sign all his work so. In the specific, the very subject of this painting is taken from [[Dante Aligheri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', [[Inferno (Dante)#Second Circle .28Lust.29|Canto V]] – it is a small watercolour [[triptych]] executed in the archaic, [[medieval]]ising style of this period in Rossetti's art, and was never painted in oil. Although the artist had been sketching the subject for many years, the watercolour took him just one week to complete. The buyer was the writer and critic [[John Ruskin]].&lt;ref&gt;The subject was commissioned by Ellen Heaton, but [[John Ruskin]], who had requested five watercolours from Rossetti, bought it for 35 guineas and offered it, along with another picture, to Miss Heaton. He described the picture to her in a letter as 'a most gloomy drawing – very grand – but dreadful – of Dante seeing the soul of Francesca and her lover!' Not surprisingly, Heaton was dissuaded from buying the picture, which Ruskin kept for himself. Cf. V. Surtees, ''The Paintings &amp; Drawings of Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882): A Catalogue Raisonné'', vol.1, Oxford 1971, p.37. See also the Tate's ref.[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=12779&amp;tabview=text&amp;texttype=10]&lt;/ref&gt; The drawing is simple and the colours generally muted. Only Francesca's long golden hair looks forward to the more sensuous creatures of Rossetti's later works. The picture was originally planned as a triptych in oil, with the same scenes as in the watercolour, but with the lovers kissing as the central motif.

===The Triptych and the inspiring ''Canto''===
[[Francesca da Rimini|Francesca]] was the sister-in-law of [[Paolo Malatesta]], and both were married, but they fell in love. Their tragic adulterous story was told by Dante in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', Canto V of the ''Inferno'', and was a popular subject with [[Victorian era|Victorian]] artists and sculptors, especially with followers of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] ideology, and with other writers.

The triptych has several inscriptions taken from Canto V, with Rossetti bringing the story to life by writing relevant quotations in the original Italian around the edge of the composition.&lt;ref&gt;The top of central panel has the inscription ''O lasso!'' ("Alas!"). At bottom left, another continues the same verse, ''quanti dolci pensier, quanto disio...'' ("how many sweet thoughts, how great desire"), Inferno, Canto V, vv.112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Its three parts read from left to right. The left-hand panel shows the adulterous kiss that condemns the lovers: staying faithful to Dante's poem, Rossetti depicts them reading about the [[Arthurian legend|Arthurian]] knight [[Sir Lancelot]] who also suffered for his forbidden love (his figure can be seen on the book's open page, dressed, like Paolo, in red and blue). The scene illustrates the following lines from Dante's text:
{{quote|One day we read, to pass the time away,
of Lancelot, of how he fell in love;
alone we were, and no suspicion near us 
... then he, who never from me shall separate,
at once my lips all trembling kissed.|''[[Divine Comedy]]'', Canto V, vv.127–136 (free transl.)}}

The central panel depicts two of Rossetti's literary heroes crowned with laurel: the Roman poet [[Virgil]] and the much-revered Dante himself – they regard with concern the two lovers on the right, who appear to float like wraiths in each other's arms, amid the flames of hell. Their adulterous relationship uncovered, they were murdered by Francesca's husband and Paolo's brother, [[Sigismondo Malatesta]], and banished to the second circle of hell.

In the final panel of the triptych, the lovers are being blown about violently with the wind, as described by Dante's verses: {{quote|The infernal storm, eternal in its rage, sweeps and drives the spirits with its blast.|''[[Divine Comedy]]'', Canto V, vv.31–32}}

The '''''Principia Discordia''''' is a [[Discordianism|Discordian]] [[religious text]] written by Greg Hill ([[Malaclypse the Younger]]) with [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]] (Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst). The first edition was printed using [[Jim Garrison]]'s Xerox printer in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Robert Anton|title=Cosmic Trigger I: Final Secret of the Illuminati|date=1992|publisher=New Falcon Publications|location=Scottsdale, AZ|isbn=978-1561840038|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition was published under the title ''Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost'' in a limited edition of five copies in 1965. The phrase ''Principia Discordia'', reminiscent of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', is presumably intended to mean ''Discordant Principles'', or ''Principles of Discordance''.

The ''Principia'' describes the Discordian Society and its Goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], as well as the basics of the [[POEE]] [[religious denomination|denomination]] of Discordianism. It features typewritten and handwritten text intermixed with clip art, stamps, and seals appropriated from other sources.

While the ''Principia'' is full of literal contradictions and unusual [[humor]], it contains several passages which propose that there is serious intent behind the work, for example a message scrawled on page 00075: "If you think the PRINCIPIA is just a ha-ha, then go read it again."

The ''Principia'' is quoted extensively in and shares many themes with the satirical [[science fiction]] book ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]]. Wilson was not directly involved in writing the Principia.
[[File:Little_Apple_of_Eris_colour.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Golden Apple, symbol of Eris, Our Lady of Discord]]
Notable symbols in the book include the [[Apple of Discord]], the [[pentagon]], and the "Sacred Chao", which resembles the [[Taijitu]] of [[Taoism]], but the two principles depicted are "Hodge" and "Podge" rather than [[yin and yang]], and they are represented by the apple and the pentagon, and not by dots. Saints identified include [[Emperor Norton]], [[Yossarian]], [[Don Quixote]], and [[Bokononism|Bokonon]].  The ''Principia'' also introduces the mysterious word "[[fnord]]", later popularized in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]''; the trilogy itself is mentioned in the afterword to the [[Loompanics]] edition, and in the various introductions to the fifth editions.

==Overview==
[[File:Poee_symbol.jpg|alt=POEE stands for Paratheo-metamystikhood of Eris Esoteric|right|thumb|100px|POEE Symbol]]
The ''Principia Discordia'' holds three core principles: the Aneristic Principle (order), the Eristic Principle (disorder) and the notion that both are mere illusions. The following excerpt summarizes these principles:{{quote|The Aneristic Principle is that of apparent order; the Eristic Principle is that of apparent disorder. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of pure chaos, which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making.

With our concept-making apparatus called "the brain" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us.
The ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled "reality" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see "reality" differently.

It is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T) True reality is a level deeper than is the level of concept.
We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The order is in the grid. That is the Aneristic Principle.

Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be true. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the Aneristic Illusion. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other.

Disorder is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like "relation", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is "absence of female-ness", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the Eristic Principle.

The belief that "order is true" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the Eristic Illusion.
The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered.

Reality is the original Rorschach. Verily! So much for all that.

—Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Pages 00049–00050}}

The ''Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost'' was first published in a limited edition of five copies and released into the [[public domain]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|title=Publisher alters, then copyrights Principia Discordia|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/01/publisher-alters-the.html|newspaper=Boing Boing|date=November 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full title of the fourth and most well-known edition is ''Principia Discordia or How I Found Goddess And What I Did To Her When I Found Her: The Magnum Opiate Of Malaclypse The Younger, Wherein is Explained Absolutely Everything Worth Knowing About Absolutely Anything''.Included on page 00075 is the following note about the history of the ''Principia'':
:''This being the 4th Edition, March 1970, San Francisco; a revision of the 3rd Edition of 500 copies, whomped together in Tampa 1969; which revised the 2nd Edition of 100 copies from Los Angeles 1969; which was a revision of ''PRINCIPIA Discordia or HOW THE WEST WAS LOST'' published in New Orleans in 1965 in five copies, which were mostly lost.''

Additionally, the "contents of this edition" note in the Loompanics edition identifies the fourth edition as having originally been published by [[Rip Off Press]] of [[San Francisco, California]].

A "Fifth Edition" consisting of a single Western Union telegram page filled with the letter M was published as an appendix to the Loompanics and SJ Games re-printings of the 4th Edition.

In 1978, a copy of a work from Kerry Thornley titled "THE PRINCIPIA Discordia or HOW THE WEST WAS LOST" was placed in the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations|HSCA JFK]] collections as document 010857.&lt;ref&gt; The record identifier can be found by searching for Thornley and Discordian on [http://www.nara.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=jfksnew.txt&amp;id=demo&amp;pass=&amp;OK=OK nara.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917155729/http://www.nara.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=jfksnew.txt&amp;id=demo&amp;pass=&amp;OK=OK |date=2008-09-17 }}. {{cite web|title=Kennedy Assassination Collection: Discordian Socity [sic]|url=http://www.nara.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/5234/jfksnew.txt|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=17 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105233622/http://www.nara.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/5234/jfksnew.txt|archivedate=5 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Gorightly, author of ''The Prankster and the Conspiracy'' about Kerry Thornley and the early Discordians, said the copy in the JFK collection was not a copy of the first edition but a later and altered version containing some of the original material.

== Mythology ==
In [[Discordianism|Discordian]] mythology, '''Aneris''' is described as the sister of [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] aka Discordia. Whereas Eris/Discordia is the Goddess of Disorder and Being, Aneris/[[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] is the Goddess of Order and Non-Being.

"DOGMA III – HISTORY 32, 'COSMOGONY'" in ''Principia Discordia'', states

:In the beginning there was VOID, who had two daughters; one (the smaller) was that of BEING, named &lt;u&gt;ERIS&lt;/u&gt;, and one (the larger) was of NON-BEING, named &lt;u&gt;ANERIS&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;ref name="principiadiscordia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/63.php |title=Page 56 |publisher=Principia Discordia |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sterile Aneris becomes jealous of Eris (who was born pregnant), and starts making existent things non-existent. This explains why life begins, and later ends in death.

:''And to this day, things appear and disappear in this very manner.''&lt;ref name="principiadiscordia" /&gt;

The names of Eris and Aneris (who are later given a brother, ''Spirituality''), are used to show some fundamental Discordian principles in "Psycho-Metaphysics":

:The Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER; the Eristic Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER. Both order and disorder are man made &lt;u&gt;concepts&lt;/u&gt; and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/bloodstar84/pd_metaphysics.html |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2012-08-19 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027092923/http://geocities.com/bloodstar84/pd_metaphysics.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qene''' also known as '''Säm əna Wärq''' is a unique style of [[poetry]] from [[Ethiopia]] that is rich and deep in meaning, which demands critical thinking and analysis of the poetry to understand its meaning. It demands having not only a strong [[Amharic]], [[Tigrigna]], or [[Ge'ez language|Ge’ez]] vocabulary, but also familiarity with the culture from where the particular poem originates or the background against which it was written.&lt;ref name="kweschn"&gt;Yigzaw, Mariye. [http://kweschn.com/2011/09/01/qene-or-sem-enna-werq-wax-and-gold/ "Qene or Sem enná Werq"], ''[[kweschn]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Yared.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Yared]]]]
It is believed that  [[Yared|Saint Yared]] is the originator of Qəne.&lt;ref&gt;Yigzaw, Mariye. [http://www.qeneonnet.org/aboutqene.php?contentid=6 "Origin &amp; Source of Qəne Subject Matter"], ''[[QeneOnNet]]'', Addis Ababa, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Since most of Saint Yared’s works are based on the Bible, thus it can be assumed that the Bible is the original source of Qəne composition. Some parts of the Bible such as the Psalms and the [[Song of Songs]] ([[Song of Songs|Song of Solomon]])  are written in poetry form. Some books of the Bible such as the Song of Songs and the teachings (sermons) of Jesus use a lot of metaphorical and allegorical language similar to the Säm əna Wärq mode of Qəne.  Saint Yared’s non-sparing use of the content and style of the Bible helped in making his compositions acceptable and popular. Some of his compositions are still used as prayers in their original form.

Although Saint Yared was the earliest composer of Qəne, he does not appear to have set the forms and meters for the genre. There are, in fact, several possible candidates deemed responsible. One possibility lies with Qəne scholars during the reign of  [[Eskender|Emperor Eskender]] (1478-1494) - Hawira, Menkera, Eskendera, Poeskenedera and Abidira. Another explanation – commonly referred to as the Wadla claim – attributes it to an early 15th-century scholar from Wadla named Yohannəs Geblawi. And then there is the Gonj claim - attributing the deed to a certain Täwanäy who flourished after the 15th century. Täwanäy is alleged to have learned his Qəne alongside Wäldä Mariam from a certain Eliab, who in turn learned it from alongside Lehib from Sämrä Ab, who in turn learned it from Yohannəs Geblawi.

Oral traditions also mention a certain Däqä Est’ifa as the scholar responsible for setting the meters for Qəne. Däqä Est’ifa is alleged to have acquired seven crafts from Greece - six having to do with magic, and the seventh Qəne - and returned to Ethiopia during the reign of [[Bä'edä Mariam|Emperor Bä'edä Mariam]] (1468-1478). He is then said to have taught the seventh craft to Prince Eskinder, Hawira, Menkera, Behur, and another Eskinder.

Däqä Est’ifa was quite popular at his former pupil Emperor Eskinder's court. One tradition claims he seduced the Emperor's wife and used one of his other crafts to vanish with her. Shortly thereafter, the Emperor set fire to the house Däqä Est’ifa and the Empress were hiding in. However, Däqä Est’ifa allegedly used another of his crafts to again disappear with his lover - and is said to still roam the island.

Yohannəs Geblawi, in contrast to Däqä Est’ifa's worldly crafts, is said to have acquired his Qəne during a spiritual meditation. Yohannəs was born at Geblon in Wadla (Lasta), and flourished at the time of [[Zara Yaqob|Emperor Zar'a Yacob]] (1434-1468). He and is said to have taught near Mount Tabor at Amara Saynt. Yohannes taught Qəne to the monk Aba Wäldä Gabriel, who in turn taught Sämrä  Kristos (Sämrä  Ab). Sämrä  Kristos (Sämrä  Ab) is said to have given [[Bä'edä Mariam|Emperor Bä'edä Mariam]] (1468-1478) Qəne lessons. He also taught Lehib and Eliab, the latter of whom taught Qəne to Täwanäy and Dədəq Wäldä Mariam.

Emperor Be'ede Mariam was so taken by the art of Qəne that he is said, on the advice of his teacher Sämrä  Kristos, to have gone into a week-long meditation to determine its origin. The answer was revealed to him on the festival of the changing of water unto wine (Qana ZeGelila), when he composed the following Qəne by divine inspiration,

        ድህረ ተሰብረ አጽንኦ ለሰብእናን ንሁክት
        ለብሃዊ ክርስቶስ በማየ ሃዲስ ጥምቀት፡፡

        After man's strength was shattered with grief,
        Christ the potter remade him with baptism.

As Be'ede Mariam's Qəne was composed during a gathering (Gubae) at the festival of [[Qana ZeGelila]], its form and meter has been known as Gubaʾe Qana. Sämrä  Kristos was then said to have composed a Zäʾämlakəye Qəne, after which the Emperor composed a Mibäzhu Qəne - the tradition claims.

One tradition also claims Täwanäy as Däqä Est’ifa's student. However, Däqä Est’ifa flourished during the reign of [[Eskender|Emperor Eskender]] - a period when third generation disciples of Yohannes Geblawi also taught. This casts into doubt the alleged role of Däqä Est’ifa as the originator of Qəne - as the line of Yohannes Geblawi would have precedence. Furthermore, the more than fifty years that span between Däqä Est’ifa and Täwanäy would make it hard to take the latter as a disciple. Moreover, other accounts put Täwanäy's time at the early 18th century.

Accordingly, along the Qəne line of Yohannes Geblawi, Sämrä Ab taught Lehib and Eliab. Eliab, in turn, taught Dədəq Wäldä Mariam and Täwanäy. Tradition also holds that due to unfavorable conditions caused by the wars of Ahmad Gragn (mid-16th century), Dədəq Wäldä Mariam and Täwanäy formed two separate Qəne styles - the Wadla and the Gonj schools, respectively.

Another interesting tradition holds that both disciples made the trip to Däq Island to further their knowledge. While Dədəq Wäldä Mariam chanced upon mystical teachers that helped him further his Qəne, Täwanäy had no such luck. Instead, he fell into the carnal snares of mystical women who thwarted his many attempts to escape. When he turned into an eagle and tried to fly away, they would turn into pebbles and stone him. When he turned into a worm to wiggle his way off the island, they would turn into chickens and peck at him. He finally managed to escape by turning into a flea and attaching himself to a sack of Gesho leaves destined for sale on the mainland! Perhaps the notion of Täwanäy as the disciple of Däqä Est’ifa stems from his legendary exploits at Däq  Island.

The same tradition claims that by the time Täwanäy escaped from Däq, he had only retained a fraction of what Eliab had taught him. Hence, the Gonj school of Qəne associated with Täwanäy stresses Qəne composition, but only fleetingly covers Ge'ez verb conjugation and syntax - whereas the Wadla school associated with Dədəq Wäldä Mariam teaches all these elements. The Wadla school was led by a succession of seven teachers - all with the title Dədəq - the last of whom was also named Dədəq Wäldä Mariam. He was succeeded by Ma'ibel Wäldä Hiwot (MeCha), who was then succeeded by Aleka Getahun (Gete Amoraw). The other disciple of Sämrä  Kristos, Lehib, taught Qəne to Zetre Wengel - who was succeeded by Zikri. He was in turn succeeded by Bekuru, and followed by Yonathan, who taught ZeNebiyat and QaleAwadi. Qale Awadi was succeeded by Aleka Maru of Amhara Sayint, who then taught Aqabe Se'at Kabte of Gonder.

Nevertheless, the multiplicity of Qəne lines of transmission does not imply multiple origins for Qəne. Saint Yared remains to be held as the founder of Qəne. Moreover, the many schools of Qəne can be seen in parallel to the various types of musical notations (such as Bethleheme, Qome, WenChere, AChabre, Wadle and Tegulete schools) that developed out of Saint Yared's Deggwa.

==Qəne and Poetry==

Traditionally any metrical verse with a rhyming scheme is defined as a poem, and since Qəne fulfills these requirements it can be considered to be a poem. However, while most poems have literal meaning, Qəne has to have a literal as well as a symbolic meaning by using the mode of Säm əna Wärq. One can say that all Qəne are poems, but not all poems can be Qəne. Qəne is different in that a profound idea can be veiled underneath an every-day idea through the mode of Säm əna Wärq (i.e. metaphorical representation). 
Since Qəne is sung as a hymn at a church service, one has to adhere to a standard metrical pattern.  The different types of Qəne have their own metrical pattern. The measure for the types of Qəne is not only numbers of verse but the syllabic metrical pattern as well. Thus, even though a poem uses a mode of Säm əna Wärq, unless it follows a certain metrical pattern it can’t be classified as a Qəne.

     እናንተ ወጣቶች ቀን አለ መስሏችሁ፣
     ከገጠሩ ኑሮ ከተማ ገብታችሁ፣
     መሠረት የሌላት ጎጆ መሥርታችሁ፣
     ዘማለች አደራ እንዳትወድቅባችሁ፡፡

     Oh! Youth thinking it is your time
     You left the countryside to settle in the city
     But your house is without foundation
     So be alert before the leaning house / harlot falls and/destroys you.

The poem has two Wärq phrases, the former is about the harlot and the latter warns about being destroyed by promiscuity. Even with such complex mode of Säm əna Wärq, the author called it a poem and not a Qəne. Thus we can see that Qəne has a much complex character than a poem.

==Qəne Language==
Most Qənes are composed in [[Ge'ez language|Ge’ez]], and most students at Qəne school start their education by learning the basics of the Gəʾəz language. Most Qənes are composed in Gəʾəz since Qəne rules regarding the Säm əna Wärq mode and metrical pattern are set up for the Gəʾəz language.&lt;ref name="kweschn" /&gt; But once we follow the right metrical pattern and rules of metaphor, one can compose Qəne in other languages. For Example in [[Amharic]], [[Oromo language|Afaan Oromo]], English …etc. This is evident in the advent of Guramayle Qəne (a blend of Gəʾəz and Amharic) and Amharic Qənes starting from the Gondarine Period (17th to 19th century)
Example of Qene blending Gəʾəz, Amharic and English:
3፡ Mäwädəs

     ኦ ብራዘርስ ውሉደ ጥምቀት፣
     እንተ በጉጓዔ ንትጋባ ውስተ ታዕካ ዘቅድስና፣
     መና ቃለወንጌል ቅዱስ እስመ በዛቲ አለና፣
     ፎር ዘ ሴክ ኦፍ ሳቲስፋይንግ ኢንተረስተ ውሉድ በጥዑም መና፣
     ወይነ ምስጋና ዘመላእከት ውስቴታ ተቀድሃ ከመ ከመ ያስተፍስህ የሰው ልቡና፣
     ኸርትሂ የገበሬ እርሻ እንዳያገኛት ሙስና፣
     ይዝነም ቃለ ወንጌል በፍቅር ወበትህተና፣
     እስመ ዝናመ ጽድቅ ተርዕየ በዘጳውሎስ ደመና፣
     ወደቂቀ ጳውሎስ አእዋም አህመልመሉ በዳኅና፡፡

     Oh Brothers, children of Baptism
     Let us hurry and enter the hall of Holiness
     Because inside there is Manna / words of the Gospel
     And to satisfy the interest of the children with tasty Manna
     The Angels’ gratitude / wine was poured to satisfy man’s conscience.
     And so that the farm/heart is not corrupted
     Let the words of the Gospel trickle with love and humility
     Because the rain of righteousness was seen in the clouds of Paul
     And the children of Paul / trees blossomed well. 
   
Meanings:
For the Säm, it is normal for people to rush towards a banquet hall where good food and drinks are being served. Comparatively, the BaläQəne(Qene Poet) advises his brothers (members of the MahəBärä Qədusan(MQ) organization) to rush towards the gates of the church where one can find food for the soul – words from the gospel and angelic voices of gratitude. In the second half, the BaläQəne recounts that without rain the farmer will lose all that he has planted. But observing the presence of rain clouds, the farmer will plant his seeds and when it rains all the plants will blossom. For the Wärq, the BaläQəne advises the MQ members to listen to the words of the gospel with love and humility. And the members are overjoyed because Patriarch Paulos, disregarding those advising him to close down the MQ association, allowed the association to continue doing its work.

==Types of Qəne==
Most Qənes are differentiated by their metrical pattern and length of verse.  There are also different types of Qəne which are differentiated by the particular usage of the Säm əna Wärq mode.  Since Qəne is sung as a hymn at a church service, classifying Qənes according to the metrical pattern is commonplace. Accordingly, there are 9 major Qəne types. And since some of them have sub-types, we can say that there are 17 types of Qəne.

The Qəne type is determined by the quantity and length of the verses. Thus there are some Qənes which have the same quantity of verses but are classified as different types of Qəne because of the variation in the length of the verses. A student starts his Qəne education starting from the shorter Qənes and working up to the lengthy Qənes. Each Qəne stage uses the previous stage as a building block. When a student is able to compose all the different types of Qəne, he is said to ''Bet Molla''. When someone presents the full variety of Qənes he is said to have composed ''Mulu Bet''.

===Gubaʾe Qana===

Gubaʾe Qana consists of two verses and symbolizes the divine and human nature of God.  There are four types of Gubaʾe Qana differentiated by length of the verse (Short Gubaʾe Qana and long Gubaʾe Qana) and Zema mode ( Gəʾəz Gubaʾe Qana and ʾəzl Gubaʾe Qana). Some say that Gubaʾe Qana got its name by being presented on Tərr 12 – the commemoration of Qana zägälila (wedding in Cana of Galilee). Others say that it got its name by being presented at an assembly in a place called Qana in Showa. Still others say that the name is given to signify the flavor (Qana) of Qəne. The fact that there are only two verses makes it ideal for beginner students and all Qəne students take their first steps in the world of Qəne with the two verse Gubaʾe Qana.

===Zäʾämlakəye===
Zäʾämlakəye consists of three verses and the zema mode is ʾəzl . The second verse is called Mändärdärya. According to some Qəne experts, the three verses symbolize the mystery of the Trinity. The name Zäʾämlakəye is derived from the fact that this type of Qəne is composed using the first line of Psalm 62 (“አምላኪየ አምላኪየ እገይስ ሀቤከ).

===Mibäzhu===
Just like Zäʾämlakəye, Mibäzhu has three verses. The zema mode is ʾəzl and symbolizes the Trinity. The name Mibäzhu is derived from the fact that this type of Qəne is composed using the first line of Psalm 3  (እግዚኦ ሚበዝኁ እለ ይሳቅዩኒ).

===Wazema===
There are two types of Wazema: Long Wazema (five verses with Araray zema mode) and Short Wazema(two verses). Some say Wazema is named as such because it is composed on the eve (wazema) of a major church holiday. Others say that the name is derived from a line in St. Yared’s chant “ዋይ ዜማ ሰማእኩ እመላእክት ቅዱሳን’’ . The long wazema is always composed on the eve of major church holidays.

===Səllase===
Səllase has six verses and the zema mode is ʾəzl . This Qəne genre symbolizes the 6 commands of the New Testament. The name is derived from the prayer of the 3 children thanking the god of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ይትባረክ እግዚአብሔር አምላከ አበዊነ አምላከ አብርሃም አምላከ ይስሃቅ አምላከ ያዕቆብ.

===Zäyəʾəze===
Zäyəʾəze Qəne is usually presented in honor of a sovereign.  The name is derived from the Psalm where it says “ይዕዜ ትስእሮ ለገብርከ”. There are two types of Zäyəʾəze: long Zäyəʾəze (five verses with Gəʾəz zema mode) and Short Zäyəʾəze  (three verses with Araray zema mode). The Short Zäyəʾəze is also called sahləkä because it is usually presented with the psalm “ተሰሃለኒ እግዚኦ በከመ እበየ ሳህልከ”.

===Mäwädəs===
The word Mäwädəs is derived from the verb ወደሰ and denotes gratefulness. There are two types of Mäwädəs: fətah litä (eight verses with Araray zema mode) and kuləkəmu  (nine verses). Fətah litä is so named because it is performed after Psalm 42 (“ፍታህ ሊተ እግዚኦ ወተበቀል በቀልየ”), while kuləkəmu is performed after Psalm 46 (ኩልክሙ አህዛብ ጥፍሁ እደዊክሙ).

===kəbər yəʾəti===
This four verse Qəne is usually composed about the subject of the Holy Cross. According to the Zema mode, kəbər yəʾəti is classified into two: Gəʾəz kəbər yəʾəti and ʾəzl kəbər yəʾəti. The name kəbər yəʾəti is derived because it is performed after Psalm 149:9 (“ክብር ይእቲ ዛቲ ለከሉ ፃድቃኑ”).

===ʾət’anä mogär===
There are two types of ʾət’anä mogär: Gəʾəz ʾət’anä mogär (seven verses) and ʾəzl ʾət’anä mogär (eleven verses). The first 4 verses of Gəʾəz ʾət’anä mogär and the first 6 verses of ʾəzl ʾət’anä mogär usually recount about the day’s festivity. The last 3 verses of Gəʾəz ʾət’anä mogär and the last 5 verses of ʾəzl ʾət’anä mogär are called ʿäsärä nəgus. The ʿäsärä nəgus is composed in honor of a sovereign or to praise or rebuke a public figure.

==Traditions of Qəne==
There are some well known traditions of Qəne such as Nät’äqa, Gəlbät’a, and Tämäst’o. The mastery of these Qəne traditions is the sign of the BaläQəne’s expertise of the genre and his placement at the summit of the Qəne world.

===Nät’äqa===
As the meaning of the term attests, this tradition signifies the taking away of verses but does not equate with stealing. Nät’äqa  involves finishing off the verses of a Qəne as another person is reciting the beginning verses. This shows that the one who is doing the Nät’äqa already knows what the other composer was going to recite.
Example: Emahoy Gälanäsh’s Nät’äqa of her father’s Qəne

When the father was reciting
   “በታቦርሂ አመ ቀነጸ ምልኮትከ ፈረስ፣” - When your divinity / horse galloped

And the daughter finished the Qəne by saying,
   “ኢክሂሉ ስብሖቶሙ ሙሴ ወኤልያስ፡፡” - Moses and Elijah could not restrain it.

The amazed father then said,
   “በከመ ሰማእኩኪ አነ ኢይሰማእኪ ጳውሎስ!” - I hope St Paul does not hear what I have heard.

Meaning:  When a strong horse gallops it is hard for the rider to restrain it.

Hidden Meaning:  When Jesus took Peter and John with him to the top of Mount Tabor and showed them his transfiguration amongst Moses and Elijah, the disciples were overwhelmed and fell on the ground. The part about St Paul is referring to the Paul’s edict barring women from teaching in public.

===Gəlbät’a===

Gəlbät’a involves taking someone’s Qəne creating a new Qəne by changing the message and rhyming scheme. For example, it is common to wish newlyweds to have a marriage like Abraham and Sarah. But another person can use Gəlbät’a and overturn the blessing by saying let your marriage be not like Abraham and Sarah.  When asked why, one can say may the bride not be mentally anguished as Sarah was when Abraham had a child from Sarah’s Servant Hagar. On the other hand, a fearful Abraham gave away his wife to King Abemelek saying she was his sister – and this is a good reason to overturn the first blessing.

Thus, likewise, one can overturn the message of a Qəne being recited and create a whole new Qəne.  Such practice will help open up new viewpoints of things we are accustomed to and help us list the advantages and disadvantages of a particular knowledge system.

===Tämäst’o===
When composing Qəne, one is usually immersed in deep contemplation (Tämäst’o) and becomes oblivious to one’s surrounding. A well known example of such a deep contemplation is the story of the BaläQəne Kəflä Yohannəs who was active during the reign of Emperor Iyassu I (1674 – 1698).  It is said that Kəflä Yohannəs lived a very humble life and was not popular among the luxury-seeking clergy of the court who were constantly at work to put a rift between him and the emperor.   On one occasion, Kəflä Yohannəs,  deep in contemplation, did not salute   as the Emperor entered the Däbrä Bərhan Səllase Church with his entourage.  The clergy were quick to point out  Kəflä Yohannəs’ faux pas to the Emperor. Knowing that Kəflä Yohannəs meant no malice, the Emperor threw at him a gold nugget to rouse him from his meditation. Kəflä Yohannəs then approached the Emperor and composed the following  Qəne:

    በእስጢፋኖስ አእባን እመ የኀልቁ፣
    ዘበጠኒ ኢያሱ በወርቁ፡፡

    Since all the stones were used on (the martyr) Stephen
    Iyassu stoned me with gold.

The clergy were further disgraced when the Emperor rewarded Kəflä Yohannəs the gold nugget.  Kəflä Yohannəs donated the gold nugget to the church.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2072">'''Regulating Lines''' is a [[design]] concept in architecture which uses proportions of geometry in buildings giving its harmony and order.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=10862664&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent architect who espoused this concept was [[Le Corbusier]].

==History==
Regulating Lines have been used in early buildings like [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] and Michaelangelo’s Capitiol etc.

==Le Corbusier==
[[File:Petit Trianon.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Front of the Petit Trianon]]
Le Corbusier argues from historical evidence that great architecture of the past has been guided by the use of what came to be known in English as ''Regulating lines''. These lines, starting at significant areas of the main volumes, could be used to rationalize the placement of features in buildings. Le Corbusier lists off several structures he claims used this, including a speculative ancient temple form, [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], the [[Capitol (Rome)|Capitol]] in [[Rome]],  the [[Petit Trianon]], and lastly, his [[World War I|prewar]] neoclassical work in [[Paris, France|Paris]] and some more contemporary modern buildings. In each case, he attempts to show how the lines augment the fine proportions and add a rational sense of coherence to the buildings. In this way, the order, the function, and the volume of the space are drawn into one architectural moment. Le Corbusier argues that this method aids in formalizing the intuitive sense of aesthetics and integrating human proportions as well.

Le Corbusier claims in the text that no architects trained in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-arts]] technique use regulating lines, because of contradictory training, but most of the Grand Prix architects did use them, even if they were supplementing the basic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Pol. "'Vers un architecture' par Le Corbusier-Saungnier," pt. 2, L'Architecte 1, no. 3. 1924, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the concept in early work, [[Villa Schwob]] in 1916.

'''The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce''' ('''RSA''') is a [[London]]-based, British organisation committed to finding practical solutions to social challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/about-us|title=About the RSA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1754 by [[William Shipley]] as the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacture and Commerce, it was granted a [[Royal Charter]] in 1847,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/about-us/history-and-archive/rsa-history-timeline|title=History of the RSA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201183144/http://www.thersa.org/about-us/history-and-archive/rsa-history-timeline|archivedate=1 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the right to use the term ''Royal'' in its name by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1908.&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/nra/lists/GB-0403-RSA.htm|title=The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce: records|author=|date=|website=nationalarchives.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shorter version, '''The Royal Society of Arts''' and the related '''RSA''' acronym, are used more frequently than the full name.

Notable past fellows include [[Charles Dickens]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[David Attenborough]], [[William Hogarth]], [[John Diefenbaker]], and [[Tim Berners-Lee]]. Today, the RSA has [[Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts|Fellows]] elected from 80 countries worldwide.

The RSA award three medals, the [[Albert Medal (RSA)|Albert Medal]], the [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] (following a decision by the Board in 2013, the Benjamin Franklin Medal is now overseen by the RSA US, although the final nomination is ratified by the UK Board) and the Bicentenary Medal. Medal winners include [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Frank Whittle|Sir Frank Whittle]], and [[Professor]] [[Stephen Hawking]]. The RSA members are innovative contributors to the human knowledge, as shown by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which records the first use of the term "[[sustainability]]" in an environmental sense of the word in the ''RSA Journal'' in 1980.

==Name and mission==
[[File:Royal Society of Arts 20130414 158.jpg|thumb|Royal Society of Arts, front of the building]]

On the RSA building's frieze ''The Royal Society of Arts'' words (see photograph) are engraved, although its full name is ''Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce''. The short name and the related R(oyal) S(ociety) of A(rts) abbreviation is used more frequently than the full name.

The RSA's mission expressed in the founding charter was to "embolden enterprise, enlarge science, refine art, improve our manufacturers and extend our commerce", but also of the need to alleviate poverty and secure [[full employment]]. On its website, the RSA characterises itself as "an enlightenment organisation committed to finding innovative practical solutions to today’s social challenges".

==Fellowship==
{{main|Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts|List of Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts}}

Prospective fellows can apply for membership (which is reviewed by a formal admissions panel);&lt;ref name="fellowship"&gt;[https://www.thersa.org/fellowship/apply-for-fellowship/ Join the Fellowship – RSA], Royal Society of Arts.

Life Fellows must have demonstrated exceptionally high achievement. The RSA says: "The RSA Fellowship is an international community [of] achievers and influencers from a wide array of backgrounds and professions, distinguished by the title 'FRSA'. Fellows are social entrepreneurs to scientists, community leaders to commercial innovators, artists and journalists to architects and engineers, and many more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/fellowship|title=Fellowship - RSA|first=|last=RSA|date=|website=www.thersa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows of the RSA are entitled to use the [[post-nominal letters]] '''FRSA'''.

==Prizes==
Originally modelled on the [[Royal Dublin Society|Dublin Society for improving Husbandry, Manufacturers and other Useful Arts]], the RSA, from its foundation, offered ''prizes'' through a Premium Award Scheme that continued for 100 years. Medals and, in some cases, money were awarded to individuals who achieved success in published challenges within the categories of Agriculture, Polite Arts, Manufacture, Colonies and Trade, Chemistry and Mechanics. Successful submission included agricultural improvements in the cultivation of crops and reforestation, devising new forms of machinery, including an extendable ladder to aid firefighting that has remained in use relatively unchanged, and artistic skill, through submissions by young students, many of whom developed into famous artists i.e. [[Edwin Landseer]] who at the age of 10 was awarded a silver medal for his drawing of a dog.

The RSA originally specifically precluded premiums for [[patent]]ed solutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://sitoc.biz/adelphicharter/pdfs/RSA_IP_Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Today the RSA continues to offer premiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/action-research-centre/enterprise-and-design/enterprise/premiums|title=RSA Premiums}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the RSA awarded the first distinctions of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI or HonRDI), reserved for "those very few who in the judgment of their peers have achieved 'sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry'".

In 1937 "The Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry" was established as an association with the object of "furthering excellence in design and its application to industrial purposes": membership of the Faculty is automatic for (and exclusive to) all RDIs and HonRDIs. The Faculty currently has 120 Royal Designers (RDI) and 45 Honorary Royal Designers (non-UK citizens who are awarded the accolade of HonRDI): the number of designers who may hold the distinction of RDI at any one time is strictly limited.

The Faculty consists of the world’s leading practitioners from fields as disparate as engineering, furniture, fashion and textiles, graphics, theater and film design. Early members include [[Eric Gill]], [[Enid Marx]], Sir [[Frank Whittle]] and numerous other household names.

==RSA House==
[[File:Mathew Taylor on the RSA.ogg|thumb|Audio description of the building by [[Matthew Taylor (Labour politician)|Mathew Taylor]]]]
The RSA moved to its current home in 1774. The House, situated in John Adam Street, near [[Strand, London|the Strand]] in central London, had been purpose-designed by the Adam Brothers ([[James Adam (architect)|James Adam]] and [[Robert Adam]]) as part of their innovative Adelphi scheme. The original building (6–8 John Adam Street) includes the Great Room, which features a magnificent sequence of paintings by Irish artist [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] titled ''The Progress of Human Knowledge and Culture'' and portraits of the Society's first and second presidents, painted by [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] respectively.

The RSA has expanded into adjacent buildings, and now includes 2 and 4 John Adam Street and 18 Adam Street. The first occupant of 18 Adam Street was the Adelphi Tavern, which is mentioned in Dickens's ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. The former private dining room of the Tavern contains a magnificent Adam ceiling with painted roundels by the school of Kauffman and Zucchi.

A major refurbishment in 2012 by Matthew Lloyd Architects won a [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] London Award in 2013, and a RIBA [[English Heritage]] Award for Sustaining the Historic Environment, also in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matthewlloyd.co.uk/projects/the-royal-society-of-arts/ The Royal Society of Arts], Matthew Lloyd Architects. Retrieved 11 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSA devised a scheme for commemorating the links between famous people and buildings, by placing plaques on the walls — these continue today as "[[blue plaque]]s" which have been administered by a range of government bodies. The first of these plaques was, in fact, of red terracotta erected outside a former residence of [[Lord Byron]] (since demolished). The Society erected 36 plaques until, in 1901, responsibility for them was transferred to the [[London County Council]] (which changed the colour of the plaques to the current blue) and, later, the [[Greater London Council]] (the G.L.C.) and, most recently, English Heritage. Similar schemes are now operated in all the [[Constituent countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] of the [[United Kingdom]].

==Associated organisations==
The origin of London's [[Royal Academy of Arts]] lies in an attempt in 1755 by members of the RSA (then simply known as the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce), principally the sculptor [[Henry Cheere]], to found an autonomous academy of arts to teach painting and sculpture. Prior to this a number of artists were members of the RSA, including Cheere and [[William Hogarth]], or were involved in small-scale private art academies, such as the [[St Martin's Lane Academy]]. Although Cheere's attempt failed, the eventual [[charter]], called an 'Instrument', used to establish the Royal Academy of Arts over a decade later was almost identical to that drawn up by Cheere and the RSA in 1755.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Sutton, ''Artisan or Artist?: A History of the Teaching of Art and Crafts in English Schools'' (London: Pergamon Press, 2014) p.297&lt;/ref&gt; The RSA also hosted the first ''exhibition of contemporary art'' in 1760. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds were among those who exhibited at this first exhibition, and were subsequently founder members of The [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1768.

The Society was a pioneer in examinations, offering the first national public examinations in 1882 that led to the formation of the RSA Examinations Board now included in the [[OCR (examination board)|Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations Board]].

In 1876, a predecessor of the [[Royal College of Music]], the ''National Training School for Music'', was founded by the RSA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41378132?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Jstor.Org RSA Journal Vol 140 Page 203, February 1992] Retrieved 19 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;


In 1929 The Society purchased the entire village of [[West Wycombe]]. After extensive repairs, the village was legally conveyed by deed to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 1936, the RSA awarded the first distinctions of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI or HonRDI), reserved for "those very few who in the judgment of their peers have achieved 'sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry'".

==Activities==
In Great Britain and Ireland, the RSA offers regional activities to encourage Fellows to address local topics of interest and to connect with other Fellows in their locality. The UK Regions are: London, Central, North, Scotland, South East, South West, Wales and, Ireland. The RSA has a presence around the world under its RSA Global scheme with a notable presence in Australia, New Zealand and the USA.&lt;ref name=Fellowship&gt;[https://www.thersa.org/fellowship/in-your-area/international "Fellowship"], RSA.

Renowned thinkers and doers have been invited to present their ideas on the RSA's stage ever since the society was founded in the 18th century "age of enlightenment". More recent speakers have included [[Sir Ken Robinson]], [[Al Gore]], [[Sir David Attenborough]], [[Alain de Botton]], [[Michael Sandel]], [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], [[Martha Nussbaum]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Susan Cain]], [[Dan Pink]], [[Dan Ariely]], [[Brene Brown]], [[Slavoj Zizek]], [[David Cameron]], and [[Dambisa Moyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/events/speakers|title=RSA Events Speakers|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327203035/http://www.thersa.org/events/speakers|archivedate=27 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of speaker for the recent annual Presidential lecture has been a matter of interest in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish professor Björn Lomborg, was chosen; his latest book, ''Cool It'', suggests that the imminent demise of polar bears is a myth. As president of the RSA, Prince Philip's first choice of speaker was Ian Plimer, professor of mineral geology at Adelaide University, but this was rejected as too controversial, as Plimer argues that the theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming is unproven.

On 14 January 2010, the RSA in partnership with Arts Council England hosted a one-day conference in London called "State of the Arts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thersa.org/events/state-of-the-arts-conference State of the Arts Conference], RSA.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of speakers from various disciplines from art to government gathered to talk about the state of the arts industry in the United Kingdom. Notable speakers included [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]] MP, Secretary of State for Culture, Media &amp; Sport and his counterpart [[Ben Bradshaw]] MP, who was then the Secretary of State for Culture, Media &amp; Sport. Notably, Jeremy Hunt stated that if the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] won the next elections then government funding for the arts would be cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jan/14/arts-funding-cuts-proposed-conservatives|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|title=Arts funding cuts proposed by Conservatives|first=Charlotte|last=Higgins|date=14 January 2010|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 14 of these had gained 46 million views as of 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/oct/21/internet-users-animated-rsa-films | work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | title=Internet users get animated about RSA short film series: Andrew Park's videos, which are drawn from capitalism and education speeches, have received 46m YouTube hits | first=Josh | last= Halliday | date=21 October 2011 | accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the no.1 nonprofit YouTube channel worldwide. The first animation in the RSA Animate series was based on [[Renata Salecl]]'s speech delivered for RSA on her book about choice.

A number of celebrity fans have tweeted about RSA Animates, including [[Yoko Ono]], [[Eric Schmidt]] and [[Milla Jovovich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/team63/status/22497441383194624|title= Milla Jovovich tweet}}{{Failed verification|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projects===
During the 1980s, the RSA worked with the [[Comino Foundation]] and established a Comino Fellowship Committee 'to change the cultural attitude to industry from one of lack of interest or dislike to one of concern and esteem'. This eventually led to a joint government/industry initiative to promote 1986 as "Industry Year",&lt;ref&gt;Sir Geoffrey Chandler CBE, (1985) "Industry Year 1986", ''Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems,'' Vol. 85 Issue: 5/6, pp.6–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Powell (1986) "The Industry Year Attack", ''Production Engineer'' vol. 65. Issue: 1, pp.13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; with the RSA and the Comino Foundation providing core funding of £250,000 – which persuaded the [[Confederation of British Industry]] to raise £1 million and government departments to provide £3 million.&lt;ref name="Darbyshire"&gt;Darbyshire, Anthony, and Duckworth, Eric (2011), [http://www.cominofoundation.org.uk/PDF/Demetrius_Comino_a_life_and_legacy_of_achievement.pdf ''Demetrius Comino: A life and legacy of achievement''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514235835/http://www.cominofoundation.org.uk/PDF/Demetrius_Comino_a_life_and_legacy_of_achievement.pdf |date=14 May 2013 }}, Comino Foundation. Retrieved 22 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, the RSA became a sponsor of an [[Academy (English school)|academy]] in [[Tipton]], The [[RSA Academy]], which opened in September 2008. New buildings are currently under construction to designs by [[John McAslan and Partners]]. Current projects include Arts and Ecology, Citizen Power, Connected Communities, Design and Society, Education, Public Services, Social Brain, and Technology in a Cold Climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/projects|title=RSA Projects|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310020748/http://www.thersa.org/projects|archivedate=10 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven schools in the RSA Family of Academies, all in the West Midlands, including The RSA Academy and [[Whitley Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rsaacademiesteachingschool.org.uk/about-us/our-academies/ | title=Our Academies | publisher=Royal Society of Arts | work=RSA Teaching School Alliance | accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past projects include delivering fresh drinking water to the developing world, rethinking intellectual property from first principles to produce a Charter (published as the [[Adelphi Charter]]), investigating schemes to manage international migration and exploring the feasibility of a UK-wide [[personal carbon trading]] system. It still promotes the practice of inclusive design, and is working with artists to communicate ideas about environmental sustainability (for example, through one of the RSA's past projects, [[WEEE Man]], and currently through the Arts and Ecology project).

[[File:Miger - Simia Petaurista.jpg|thumb|right|White-nosed monkey of [[Benin]].&lt;br /&gt;[[Guenon|Cercopithecus petaurista]].&lt;br /&gt;Plate from ''La Ménagerie du Muséum'' by Simon-Charles Miger.]]
'''Simon-Charles Miger''' ([[Nemours]], 19 February 1736 – [[Paris]], 28 February 1828) was a French engraver, most notable for the plates he produced for ''La Ménagerie du Muséum national d'histoire naturelle'' by [[Bernard Germain de Lacépède|Lacépède]], [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Saint-Hilaire]] and [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]].

==Life and work==
Son of a tanner who sent him to study in Paris, Miger took various jobs including teacher, tutor and secretary before discovering a passion for engraving. He apprenticed to [[Charles Nicolas Cochin]], which employed him as a clerk, and attended the workshop of [[Johann Georg Wille]]. He developed into a portraitist, and then fell in love with a woman with whom he courted for four years until his situation finally allow her to marry him. In 1778, Miger was accredited by the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]], where he was admitted as a member in 1781. During the [[French Revolution]], he argued alongside [[Jean-Michel Moreau]] and [[Adélaïde Labille-Guiard]] for the renovation of the statutes that were falling into disrepair. "The laws of the state, he says, are granted by the French people, those of the Academy shall be through all académicien people." But these reform proposals were rendered obsolete by the abolition of Academies, decreed by the [[National Convention]] in 1795. In 1800, Miger is charged with [[Bernard Germain de Lacépède]] to engrave the planks of his work on the menagerie of the [[National Museum of Natural History]]. He then continues to handle the chisel and compose verses until the age of nearly 90 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7166">A '''story arc''' (also '''narrative arc''')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-narrative-arc-in-literature-852484 "Narrative Arc – What is Narrative Arc in Literature?"]. ThoughtCo.&lt;/ref&gt; is an extended or continuing [[narrative|storyline]] in [[episode|episodic]] storytelling media such as [[television]], [[comic book]]s, [[comic strip]]s, [[boardgames]], [[video game]]s, and [[films]] with each episode following a [[dramatic arc]]. On a [[television program]], for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in [[comedy|comedies]], especially in [[soap opera]]s. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Lew, "Lew Hunter's Screenwriting 434: The Industry's Premier Teacher Reveals the Secrets of the Successful Screenplay", Peregee Books, a division of Penguin, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Webcomic]]s are more likely to use story arcs than [[comic strip|newspaper comics]], as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term "story arc" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series ''[[Wiseguy]]'',{{clarification needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Boulware, Hugh (September 18, 1988). [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-09-18/entertainment/8802010198_1_wiseguy-ken-wahl-sonny-steelgrave "Hollywood Not Ken Wahl's Kind Of Town"]. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and was quickly adapted for other uses.

Many American comic book series are now written in four or six-issue arcs, within a continuing series. Short story arcs are easier to package as [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]s for resale, and more accessible to the casual reader than the never-ending [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that once characterised US comics.
A corollary to the absence of continuity, however, is that, as exemplified in 1950s DC ''Superman'' comics, no permanent change to characters or situations occurs, meaning no growth can take place; thus storylines repeat over time in an endless loop.

==Dramatic structure and purpose==
The purpose of a story arc is to move a character or a situation from one state to another; in other words, to [[Peripeteia|effect change]]. This change or transformation often takes the form of either a [[tragedy|tragic]] fall from grace or a reversal of that pattern. One common form in which this reversal is found is a character going from a situation of weakness to one of strength. For example, a poor woman goes on adventures and in the end makes a fortune for herself, or a lonely man falls in love and marries.

Another form of storytelling that offers a change or transformation of [[Character arc|character]] is that of "hero's journey," as laid out in [[Joseph Campbell]]'s theory of the [[monomyth]] in his work, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. [[Christopher Vogler]]'s ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers]]'' details the same theory specifically for western storytelling.

Story arcs in contemporary drama often follow the pattern of bringing a character to a low point, removing the structures the character depends upon, and then forcing the character to find new strength without those structures. In a story arc, the character undergoes substantial growth or change, which culminates in the [[denouement]] in the last third or quarter of a story.

==In television and radio==
{{See also|Serial (radio and television)}}
Story arcs on television (and also on radio) have existed for decades (one notable (albeit, unusual) example, from the so-called "Golden Age of Radio", being the 1946 [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]] Summer-run docudrama serial, ''The Fifth Horseman'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/The_Fifth_Horseman|title=The Fifth Horseman|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; which (in part) featured a four-episode arc regarding a hypothetical chain of events (spanning nearly two full "future" decades) surrounding a fictitious [[nuclear holocaust]]), and are common in many countries where multi-episode storylines are the norm (an example being the UK's ''[[Doctor Who]]''), as well as most [[anime]] series.

Many arc-based series in past decades, such as ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]'', were often short-lived and found it difficult to attract new viewers; they also rarely appear in traditional [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] (one notable example being the science fiction "novel for television" ''[[Babylon 5]]''). However, the rise of [[DVD]] retail and [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] of television series has worked in arc-based productions' favor as the standard season collection format allows the viewer to have easy access to the relevant episodes. One area of television where story arcs have always thrived, however, is in the realm of the soap opera, and often episodic series have been derisively referred to as "soap operas" when they have adopted story arcs.

Arc-based series draw and reward dedicated viewers, and fans of a particular show follow and discuss different story arcs independently from particular episodes. Story arcs are sometimes split into subarcs, if deemed significant by fans, making it easy to refer to certain episodes if their production order titles are unknown. Episodes not relevant to story arcs (such as "monsters of the week") are sometimes dismissed as [[filler (media)|filler]] by fans, but might be referred to as self-contained or stand-alone episodes by producers.

===Usage in manga and anime===
[[Manga]] and anime are usually good examples of arc-based stories, to the point that most series shorter than twenty-six chapters are a single arc spanning all the chapters. This makes syndication difficult, as episodes watched in isolation often confuse viewers unless watched in conjunction with the series as a whole. Series of thirty chapters or longer usually have multiple arcs.

''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (TV)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', for example, is a single story arc spanning twenty-six episodes. Other longer anime have multiple story arcs, such as ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', ''[[Higurashi When They Cry|Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' and ''[[Fairy Tail]]''. The anime ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' adapts four different story arcs from the ''Dragon Ball'' manga, each with its own ultimate antagonist, along with original story arcs created for the TV series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3936">'''Studio craft''' is the practice of [[craft]] methodology in an artist's studio. Traditional craft tends to generate craft objects out of necessity or for ceremonial use while studio craft  produces craft objects at the whim of the maker or intended owner. These objects are at most only ''desirable'' for use and often lack any utility. Because studio craft doesn't make objects out of necessity, it is similar to works of studio art which are made for aesthetic rather than functional purposes. 

Because of their diminished reliance on making objects for functionality, the studio craft object becomes more viable for the kind of [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] critical theory which occurs in [[fine art]] theory.

== Craft theory ==

Though studio craft works do seem to have some of the necessary conditions required for injection into critical art discourse, simplifying craft theory as synonymous with art theory strikes some crafts theorists as problematic. [[Glenn Adamson]] argues that the interesting thing about Craft is that it ''is'' perceived to be 'inferior' to art. In his book ''Thinking Through Craft'' Adamson presents an overview of this question by presenting five aspects of this supposed second-class identity:  supplementarity, sensuality, skill, the pastoral, and the amateur &lt;ref&gt;Adamson, Glenn  ''Thinking through craft''. Oxford, New York: Berg 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the implied second-class status of these themes, Adamson suggests that these are in fact the things that make craft significant and unique.

== History ==

''' The arts and crafts movement '''
The [[arts and crafts movement]] has played a significant role in the formulation of the studio crafts due in large part to the arts and crafts movement's emphasis on both the hand made object and the importance of the individual maker. This has been especially true in North America  (see [[American craft]])and the British Isles. Though the studio crafts have been in development for more than one-hundred years since the arts and crafts movement proper its influence remains remarkably consistent.

== DIY craft==
One of the more recent developments in studio craft seems to be the emergence of a solidified [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY) movement. Since the mid-century turn towards the conceptualization of the craft object significant academic and institutional structures have emerged to support studio craft. As of 2008 there are hundreds of masters and even doctoral programs dedicated solely to working in crafts media and theory, and as many museums and cultural institutions dedicated to contemporary craft. This trend however has not been without its opponents who claim that studio craft has undercut its origins by overinflating its product, making it entirely inaccessible to anyone who cannot afford the exorbitant prices studio craftspeople demand. These arguments have grown louder and there has been a significant trend towards listening to the voices of "DIYers," that is, makers whose training has not come from a necessarily institutional source and whose audience lies outside the narrow confines of "Studio Craft Institutions."  DIY craft can be found in many places among them the internet hub Etsy and in many craft fairs and venues around the country. 
The work of "DIYers" is often pejoratively referred to as "Crafty Craft" or "Craft with a K."

[[File:Caspar David Friedrich - Wanderer above the sea of fog.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Caspar David Friedrich]], ''[[Wanderer above the Sea of Fog]],'' 1817, [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]]. Romantic artists during the 19th century used the epic of nature as an expression of the sublime]]
In [[aesthetics]], the '''sublime''' (from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:sublimis#Latin|sublīmis]]'') is the quality of greatness, whether physical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, [[aesthetic]], spiritual, or artistic. The term especially refers to a greatness beyond all possibility of calculation, measurement, or imitation.

==Ancient philosophy==

The first known study of the ''sublime'' is ascribed to [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]: Peri Hupsous/Hypsous or ''[[On the Sublime]]''. This is thought to have been written in the 1st century AD though its origin and authorship are uncertain. For Longinus, the sublime is an adjective that describes great, elevated, or lofty thought or language, particularly in the context of [[rhetoric]]. As such, the sublime inspires [[awe]] and veneration, with greater persuasive powers. Longinus' treatise is also notable for referring not only to Greek authors such as [[Homer]], but also to biblical sources such as [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].

This treatise was rediscovered in the 16th century, and its subsequent impact on aesthetics is usually attributed to its translation into French by linguist [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux]] in 1674. Later the treatise was translated into English by John Pultney in 1680, [[Leonard Welsted]] in 1712, and [[William Smith (scholar)|William Smith]] in 1739 whose translation had its fifth edition in 1800.

The development of the concept of the sublime as an aesthetic quality in nature distinct from beauty was first brought into prominence in the 18th century in the writings of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley-Cooper, third earl of Shaftesbury]], and [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]], in expressing an appreciation of the fearful and irregular forms of external nature, and [[Joseph Addison]]'s synthesis of  concepts of the sublime in his ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', and later the ''Pleasures of the Imagination''. All three Englishmen had, within the span of several years, made the journey across the [[Alps]] and commented in their writings of the horrors and harmony of the experience, expressing a contrast of aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, Marjorie Hope. ''Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory''. Ithaca, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

John Dennis was the first to publish his comments in a journal letter published as ''Miscellanies'' in 1693, giving an account of crossing the Alps where, contrary to his prior feelings for the beauty of nature as a "delight that is consistent with reason", the experience of the journey was at once a pleasure to the eye as music is to the ear, but "mingled with Horrours, and sometimes almost with despair".&lt;ref name=Nicolson1974&gt;Nicolson, Marjorie Hope. "Sublime in External Nature". ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas''. New York, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaftesbury had made the journey two years prior to Dennis but did not publish his comments until 1709 in the ''Moralists''. His comments on the experience also reflected pleasure and repulsion, citing a "wasted mountain" that showed itself to the world as a "noble ruin" (Part III, Sec. 1, 390&amp;ndash;91), but his concept of the sublime in relation to beauty was one of degree rather than the sharp contradistinction that Dennis developed into a new form of literary criticism. Shaftesbury's writings reflect more of a regard for the awe of the infinity of space ("Space astonishes" referring to the Alps), where the sublime was not an aesthetic quality in opposition to beauty, but a quality of a grander and higher importance than beauty. In referring to the Earth as a "Mansion-Globe" and "Man-Container" Shaftsbury writes "How narrow then must it appear compar'd with the capacious System of its own Sun...tho animated with a sublime Celestial Spirit...." (Part III, sec. 1, 373).&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Anthony Ashley, Third Earl of Shaftesbury. ''The Moralists: A Philosophical Rhapsody''. 1709.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Addison embarked on the [[Grand Tour]] in 1699 and commented in ''Remarks on Several Parts of Italy etc.'' that "The Alps fill the mind with an agreeable kind of horror".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Addison, ''Remarks on Several Parts of Italy etc. in the years 1701, 1702, 1703''. 1773 edition, printed for T. Walker. Chapter on ‘Geneva and the Lake’: 261 Located on Google books, accessed 11.12.07&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of Addison's concept of the sublime is that the three pleasures of the imagination that he identified; greatness, uncommonness, and beauty, "arise from visible objects" (that is, from sight rather than from rhetoric). It is also notable that in writing on the "Sublime in external Nature", he does not use the term "sublime" but uses semi-synonymous terms: "unbounded", "unlimited", "spacious", "greatness", and on occasion terms denoting excess.&lt;ref name=Nicolson1974/&gt;

====Edmund Burke====

Addison's notion of greatness was integral to the concept of sublimity. An object of art could be beautiful yet it could not possess greatness. His ''Pleasures of the Imagination'', as well as [[Mark Akenside|Mark Akenside's]] ''[[Pleasures of the Imagination]]'' of 1744 and [[Edward Young|Edward Young's]] poem ''[[Night Thoughts (poem)|Night Thoughts]]'' of 1745 are generally considered the starting points for [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] analysis of sublimity.

[[Edmund Burke]] developed his conception of sublimity in ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' of 1756.&lt;ref name=Nicolson1974/&gt; Burke was the first [[philosopher]] to argue that sublimity and beauty are ''mutually exclusive''. The dichotomy that Burke articulated is not as simple as Dennis' opposition, and is antithetical in the same degree as light and darkness. Light may accentuate beauty, but either great light or darkness, i. e., the absence of light, is sublime to the extent that it can annihilate vision of the object in question. What is "dark, uncertain, and confused"&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Burke]], ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'', Part 1, Section 7: "Whatever is fitted in any sort to excite the ideas of pain, and danger, that is to say, whatever is in any sort terrible, or is conversant about terrible objects, or operates in a manner analogous to terror, is a source of the ''sublime''; that is, it is productive of the strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling...." In Part 2, Section 2, Burke wrote that "terror is in all cases whatsoever, either more openly or latently, the ruling principle of the sublime."&lt;/ref&gt; moves the imagination to awe and a degree of horror. While the relationship of sublimity and beauty is one of mutual exclusivity, either can provide pleasure. Sublimity may evoke horror, but knowledge that the perception is a fiction is pleasureful.&lt;ref&gt;Monroe C. Beardsley, "History of Aesthetics", ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Volume 1, p. 27 (Macmillan, 1973). But [[Edmund Burke]] disagreed: "Nor is it, either in real or fictitious distresses, our immunity from them which produces our delight ... it is absolutely necessary that my life should be out of any imminent hazard, before I can take a delight in the sufferings of others, real or imaginary ... it is a sophism to argue from thence, that this immunity is the cause of my delight". (''[[A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'', Part 1, Section 15)&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke's concept of sublimity was an antithetical contrast to the classical conception of the aesthetic quality of beauty being the pleasurable experience that [[Plato]] described in several of his dialogues, e. g. ''[[Philebus]]'', ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', ''[[Hippias major|Hippias Major]]'', and ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', and suggested that ugliness is an aesthetic quality in its capacity to instill intense emotions, ultimately providing pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Stolnitz, "Ugliness", ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (McMillan, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Aristotle]], the function of artistic forms was to instill pleasure, and he first pondered the problem that an object of art representing ugliness produces "pain." Aristotle's detailed analysis of this problem involved his study of tragic literature and its paradoxical nature as both shocking and having poetic value.&lt;ref&gt;Monroe C. Beardsley, "History of Aesthetics", ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Volume 1, p. 20 (Macmillan, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; The classical notion of ugliness prior to Edmund Burke, most notably described in the works of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine of Hippo]], denoted it as the absence of form and therefore as a degree of non-existence. For St. Augustine, beauty is the result of the benevolence and goodness of God in His creation, and as a category it had no opposite. Because ugliness lacks any attributive value, it is formless due to the absence of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Stolnitz, "Ugliness", ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (McMillan, 1973). Also, Monroe C. Beardsley, "History of Aesthetics", ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Volume 1, p. 22 (Macmillan, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke's treatise is also notable for focusing on the [[Physiology|physiological]] effects of sublimity, in particular the dual emotional quality of fear and attraction that other authors noted. Burke described the sensation attributed to sublimity as a ''negative pain'', which he denominated "delight" and which is distinct from positive pleasure. "Delight" is thought to result from the removal of pain, caused by confronting a sublime object, and supposedly is more intense than positive pleasure. Though Burke's explanations for the physiological effects of sublimity, e. g. tension resulting from eye strain, were not seriously considered by later authors, his [[empiricism|empirical]] method of reporting his own psychological experience was more influential, especially in contrast to the analysis of [[Immanuel Kant]]. Burke is also distinguished from Kant in his emphasis on the subject's realization of his physical limitations rather than any supposed sense of moral or spiritual transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa L. Ryan, "The Physiological Sublime: Burke’s Critique of Reason", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Volume 62, Number 1 (April 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===German philosophy===

====Immanuel Kant====
{{see also|Immanuel Kant#Aesthetic philosophy}}
[[File:St-peter's-viviano-codazzi-prado-1630.jpg|thumb|right|[[Viviano Codazzi]]: Rendition of [[St. Peter's Square]], Rome, dated 1630. Kant referred to St. Peter's as "splendid", a term he used for objects producing feeling for both the beautiful and the sublime.]]
[[Immanuel Kant]], in 1764, made an attempt to record his thoughts on the observing subject's mental state in ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]''. He held that the sublime was of three kinds: the noble, the splendid, and the terrifying.

In his ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' (1790),&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel.  ''Critique of Judgment''. Trans. J.H. Bernard. Macmillan, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant officially says that there are two forms of the sublime, the mathematical and the dynamical, although some commentators hold that there is a third form, the moral sublime, a layover from the earlier "noble" sublime.&lt;ref&gt;Clewis, Robert. 2009. ''The Kantian Sublime and the Revelation of Freedom''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. http://www.cambridge.org/us/knowledge/isbn/item2326741/?site_locale=en_US&lt;/ref&gt; Kant claims, "We call that sublime which is absolutely great"(§ 25). He distinguishes between the "remarkable differences" of the Beautiful and the Sublime, noting that beauty "is connected with the form of the object", having "boundaries", while the sublime "is to be found in a formless object", represented by a "boundlessness" (§ 23). Kant evidently divides the sublime into the mathematical and the dynamical, where in the mathematical "aesthetical comprehension" is not a consciousness of a mere greater unit, but the notion of absolute greatness not inhibited with ideas of limitations (§ 27). The dynamically sublime is "nature considered in an aesthetic judgment as might that has no dominion over us", and an object can create a fearfulness "without being afraid ''of'' it" (§ 28). He considers both the beautiful and the sublime as "indefinite" concepts, but where beauty relates to the "Understanding", sublime is a concept belonging to "Reason", and "shows a faculty of the mind surpassing every standard of Sense" (§ 25). For Kant, one's inability to grasp the magnitude of a sublime event such as an earthquake demonstrates inadequacy of one's sensibility and imagination. Simultaneously, one's ability to subsequently identify such an event as singular and whole indicates the superiority of one's cognitive, supersensible powers. Ultimately, it is this "supersensible substrate," underlying both nature and thought, on which true sublimity is located.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel.  ''Critique of Judgment''. Trans. J.H. Bernard. Macmillan, 1951. Translator's introduction and notes to the ''Critique of Judgment'')&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arthur Schopenhauer====
To clarify the concept of the feeling of the sublime, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] listed examples of its transition from the beautiful to the most sublime. This can be found in the first volume of his ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', § 39.

For him, the feeling of the beautiful is in seeing an object that invites the observer to transcend individuality, and simply observe the idea underlying the object. The feeling of the sublime, however, is when the object does not invite such contemplation but instead is an overpowering or vast malignant object of great magnitude, one that could destroy the observer.

*''Feeling of Beauty'' &amp;ndash; Light is reflected off a flower. (Pleasure from a mere perception of an object that cannot hurt observer).
*''Weakest Feeling of Sublime'' &amp;ndash; Light reflected off stones. (Pleasure from beholding objects that pose no threat, objects devoid of life).
*''Weaker Feeling of Sublime'' &amp;ndash; Endless desert with no movement. (Pleasure from seeing objects that could not sustain the life of the observer).
*''Sublime'' &amp;ndash; Turbulent Nature. (Pleasure from perceiving objects that threaten to hurt or destroy observer).
*''Full Feeling of Sublime'' &amp;ndash; Overpowering turbulent Nature. (Pleasure from beholding very violent, destructive objects).
*''Fullest Feeling of Sublime'' &amp;ndash; Immensity of Universe's extent or duration. (Pleasure from knowledge of observer's nothingness and oneness with Nature).

====Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel====
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] considered the sublime a marker of cultural difference and a characteristic feature of oriental art. His [[Teleology|teleological]] view of history meant that he considered "oriental" cultures as less developed, more [[autocracy|autocratic]] in terms of their political structures and more fearful of [[god|divine law]]. According to his reasoning, this meant that oriental artists were more inclined towards the aesthetic and the sublime: they could engage God only through [[Aufheben|"sublated"]] means. He believed that the excess of intricate detail that is characteristic of [[Chinese art]], or the dazzling metrical patterns characteristic of [[Islamic art]], were typical examples of the sublime and argued that the disembodiment and formlessness of these art forms inspired the viewer with an overwhelming aesthetic sense of awe.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G.W.F. ''Aesthetics: Lectures on Fine Art.''  Translated by T.M. Know.  Oxford: Clarendon, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rudolf Otto====
[[Rudolf Otto]] compared the sublime with his newly coined concept of the [[numinous]]. The numinous comprises terror, ''Tremendum'', but also a strange fascination, ''Fascinans''.

==Contemporary philosophy==
===20th century===
[[File:SMSMS.JPG|thumb|right|220px| [[Maurizio Bolognini]], ''SMSMS (SMS Mediated Sublime''), 2000-2006, an interactive installation that aims to involve the audience in the experience of the manipulation and consumption of the ''technological sublime''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurizio Bolognini]], "The SMSMS Project: Collective Intelligence Machines in the Digital City", ''Leonardo'', [[MIT Press]], 37/2, 2004, pp. 147-149. See also [[Maurizio Bolognini]], "De l'interaction à la démocratie. Vers un art génératif post-digital" / [http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm "From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art"], ''Artmedia X Proceedings''. Paris 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The last decades of the 19th century saw the rise of ''Kunstwissenschaft'', or the "science of art"—a movement to discern laws of aesthetic appreciation and arrive at a scientific approach to aesthetic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Stolnitz, Jerome. "Beauty". In ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 1, p. 266. Macmillan (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century [[Neo-Kantian]] German philosopher and theorist of aesthetics [[Max Dessoir]] founded the ''Zeitschrift für Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft'', which he edited for many years, and published the work ''Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft'' in which he formulated five primary aesthetic forms: the beautiful, the sublime, the tragic, the ugly, and the comic.&lt;ref&gt;Emery, Stephen A.. "Dessoir, Max". In ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 2, p. 355. Macmillan (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of the sublime involves a self-forgetfulness where personal fear is replaced by a sense of well-being and security when confronted with an object exhibiting superior might, and is similar to the experience of the tragic. The "tragic consciousness" is the capacity to gain an exalted state of consciousness from the realization of the unavoidable suffering destined for all men and that there are oppositions in life that can never be resolved, most notably that of the "forgiving generosity of deity" subsumed to "inexorable fate".&lt;ref&gt;Emery, Stephen A.. "Dessoir, Max". In ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 2, p. 356. Macmillan (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Weiskel re-examined Kant's aesthetics and the Romantic conception of the sublime through the prism of [[semiotics|semiotic theory]] and [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiskel, Thomas. ''The Romantic Sublime '' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;  He argued that Kant's "mathematical sublime" could be seen in semiotic terms as the presence of an excess of [[Sign (semiotics)|signifiers]], a monotonous infinity threatens to dissolve all oppositions and distinctions.  The "dynamic sublime", on the other hand, was an excess of signifieds: meaning was always [[Overdetermination|overdetermined]].

According to [[Jean-François Lyotard]], the sublime, as a theme in aesthetics, was the founding move of the [[Modernist]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-François. ''Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime''. Trans. Elizabeth Rottenberg. Stanford University Press, 1994. Lyotard expresses his own elements of the sublime but recommends ''Kant's Critique of Judgment'', §23&amp;ndash;§29 as a preliminary reading requirement to understanding his analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lyotard argued that the modernists attempted to replace the beautiful with the release of the perceiver from the constraints of the human condition.  For him, the sublime's significance is in the way it points to an ''[[aporia]]'' (impassable doubt) in human reason; it expresses the edge of our conceptual powers and reveals the multiplicity and instability of the [[Postmodernity|postmodern world]].

===21st century===
According to [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]], the concept of the sublime should be examined first of all in relation to the epochal novelty of digital technologies, and technological artistic production: [[new media art]], [[computer generated art|computer-based generative art]], networking, telecommunication art.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the new technologies are creating conditions for a new kind of sublime: the "technological  sublime". The traditional categories of aesthetics (beauty, meaning, expression, feeling) are being replaced by the notion of the sublime, which after being  "natural" in the 18th century, and "metropolitan-industrial" in the modern era, has now become technological.

There has also been some resurgence of interest in the sublime in [[analytic philosophy]] since the early 1990s, with occasional articles in ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' and ''The British Journal of Aesthetics'', as well as monographs by writers such as Malcolm Budd, James Kirwan and Kirk Pillow. As in the postmodern or critical theory tradition, analytic philosophical studies often begin with accounts of Kant or other philosophers of the 18th or early 19th centuries. Noteworthy is a general theory of the sublime, in the tradition of Longinus, Burke and Kant, in which [[Tsang Lap Chuen]] takes the notion of limit-situations in human life as central to the experience.&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, Lap Chuen. ''The Sublime: Groundwork towards a Theory''. University of Rochester Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jadranka Skorin-Kapov]] in ''The Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, Ecstasy, Sublimity''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skorin-Kapov|first1=Jadranka|title=The Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, Ecstasy, Sublimity|date=2016|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-1-4985-2456-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues for sublimity as the common root to aesthetics and ethics, "The origin of surprise is the break (the pause, the rupture) between one's sensibility and one's powers of representation... The recuperation that follows the break between one's sensibility and one's representational capability leads to sublimity and the subsequent feelings of admiration and/or responsibility, allowing for the intertwining of aesthetics and ethics... The roles of aesthetics and ethics—that is, the roles of artistic and moral judgments, are very relevant to contemporary society and business practices, especially in light of the technological advances that have resulted in the explosion of visual culture and in the mixture of awe and apprehension as we consider the future of humanity."

'''''The Knickerbocker''''', or '''''New-York Monthly Magazine''''', was a [[literary magazine]] of [[New York City]], founded by [[Charles Fenno Hoffman]] in 1833, and published until 1865. Its long-term editor and publisher was [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]], whose "Editor's Table" column was a staple of the magazine.

The circle of writers who contributed to the magazine and populated its cultural milieu are often known as the "Knickerbocker writers" or the "[[Knickerbocker Group]]". The group included such authors as [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], [[James Russell Lowell]] and many others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Callow, James T. ''Kindred Spirits: Knickerbocker Writers and American Artists, 1807–1855''. Chapel Hill: [[The University of North Carolina Press]], 1967: 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Knickerbocker'' was devoted to the fine arts in particular with occasional news, editorials and a few full-length biographical sketches.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Callow 1967, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was one of the earliest literary vehicles for communication about the United States' "vanishing wilderness." As such, ''The Knickerbocker'' may be considered one of the earliest proto-environmental magazines in the United States.&lt;ref name=nash&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nash |first1=Roderick F |year=2001 |title=Wilderness and the American Mind |edition=4th |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |pages=97–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Charles Fenno Hoffman]] was the founding editor of ''The Knickerbocker'' in 1833, though he helmed only three issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pattee |first1=Fred Lewis|title=The First Century of Literature: 1770–1870 |location=New York |publisher=[[Cooper Square Publishers]] |year=1966 |page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman turned the magazine over to Timothy Flint, who changed the original name ''The Knickerbacker'' to ''The Knickerbocker.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Fenno Hoffman|last=Barnes|first=Homer|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1930|isbn=|location=New York|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flint then sold the magazine to [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]], who bought it in April 1834 and served as editor until 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Perry. ''The Raven and the Whale: The War of Words and Wits in the Era of Poe and Melville''. New York: Harvest Book, 1956: 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1840, ''The Knickerbocker'' was the most influential literary publication of its time.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1956, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The year before, [[Washington Irving]] had reluctantly joined the staff at a salary of $2,000 a year and would stay on staff until 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1956, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving disliked magazine work, specifically because of its monthly deadlines and space constraints. However, in his "[[The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.|Geoffrey Crayon]]" persona, he justified his choice in his debut issue: "I am tired... of writing volumes... there is too much preparation, arrangement, and parade... I have thought, therefore, of securing to myself a snug corner in some periodical work, where I might, as it were, loll at my ease in my elbow chair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Brian Jay |title=Washington Irving: An American Original |location=New York |publisher=Arcade |year=2008 |page=333 |isbn=978-1-55970-836-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circle of writers who contributed to the magazine and populated its cultural milieu are often known as the "Knickerbocker writers" or the "Knickerbocker Group". The group included such authors as [[Washington Irving]],  William Cullen Bryant, [[James Kirke Paulding]], [[Gulian Crommelin Verplanck]], [[Fitz-Greene Halleck]], [[Joseph Rodman Drake]], [[Robert Charles Sands]], [[Lydia M. Child]], [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]], and [[Epes Sargent (poet)|Epes Sargent]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 30. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers associated with the group include Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, James Russell Lowell, [[Bayard Taylor]], [[George William Curtis]], [[Richard Henry Stoddard]], [[Elizabeth Clementine Stedman]], [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], [[Horace Greeley]], [[James Fenimore Cooper]], [[Fitz Hugh Ludlow]] and [[Frederick Swartwout Cozzens]]. ''The Knickerbocker'' was one of the earliest publications of its type to pay its contributing writers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:Diedrich Knickerbocker.jpg|150px|thumbnail|left|Diedrich Knickerbocker]]

At the time, "Knickerbocker" was a term for Manhattan's aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riis|first=Jacob A.|title=How the other half lives: studies among the tenements of New York|year=2009|publisher=Digireads.com Pub.|location=[[Lawrence, Kansas]]|isbn=1-4209-2503-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knickerbocker was also an imaginary personage created by [[Washington Irving]] to promote his new book at the time, ''A History of New-York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty.'' The work was a satire of both history books and the politics of the time. Irving published the work in 1809 under the pseudonym "[[Diedrich Knickerbocker]]."  Prior to the release of his book though, Irving placed a series of missing person adverts in New York newspapers concerning Diedrich Knickerbocker, convincing the public that he was a legitimate historian. However, though people soon realized it was a [[hoax]], Diedrich Knickerbocker became a much-loved character and legend for those of the city of New York.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Brian Jay|title=Washington Irving: an American original|year=2007|publisher=Arcade|location=New York|isbn=978-1-55970-836-4|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also the namesake of the New York basketball team, [[New York Knicks|The Knicks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wolfert's Roost and Miscellanies by Washington Irving.|year=2008|publisher=MobileReference.com|location=Boston|isbn=1-60501-996-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Knickerbacker Magazine'' was started in January 1833 with its first issue containing a supposed conversation with Diedrich Knickerbocker. In the interview he “readily forgave the liberty taken with his name in consideration of our having restored it to its ancient spelling.” This refers to the change from ''Knickerbocker'' to ''Knickerbacker''. However, the second issue was published with the title changed to ''Knickerbocker'' including another conversation with Diedrich Knickerbocker in which he says "I wish thee to restore my name to its original spelling as it stands in my celebrated History; so as fortune has given immortal glory to what some would consider a discreditable mistake I will even take it as it came and add the 'O' to the end of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knickerbocker|first=Howard|title=Knickerbocker History (Some Thoughts On The Origins Of The Name)|url=http://www.knic.com/Kn_Hist.htm|work=Knickerbocker Genealogy|accessdate=4 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204190544/http://www.knic.com/Kn_Hist.htm|archivedate=4 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Knickerbocker, Volume 2 Volumes 349-360 of American periodical series, 1800-1850|year=1833|publisher=Peabody, 1833|location=New York, New York|asin=B002YD7K36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hLZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

''The Knickerbocker'' was devoted to the fine arts in particular with occasional news and editorials. Full-length biographical sketches were also printed on such artists as [[Gilbert Stuart]], [[Hiram Powers]], [[Horatio Greenough]], and [[Frederick Styles Agate]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
[[File:Edward Hitchcock.jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|Edward Hitchcock]]
According to environmental historian, [[Roderick Nash]], ''The Knickerbocker'' was one of the earliest literary vehicles for communication about the United States' "vanishing wilderness", including serialized articles by [[Thomas Cole]] and [[Francis Parkman|Francis Parkman, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="nash"/&gt; As such, ''The Knickerbocker'' may be considered one of the earliest proto-environmental magazines in the United States.
''The Knickerbocker'' printed the earliest-known reference to the joke "[[Why did the chicken cross the road?]]"&lt;ref&gt;''The Knickerbocker, or The New York Monthly''. March 1847: 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1800s, the [[Edward Hitchcock|Reverend Edward Hitchcock]] came across a set of what appeared to him to be giant bird tracks. These later turned out to be [[Hitchcock Ichnological Cabinet|reptile tracks]], however they nonetheless inspired him to write a poem entitled "The Sandstone Bird" involving the reanimation of a great sandstone bird by a female mystic. Later published in ''The Knickerbocker'' by Hitchcock, under the pseudonym Poetaster, this is widely believed to have been the first [[Ichnology|ichnological poem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pemberton|first=S.

== Environmental impact ==

Eric Kaufman, a professor of politics commented in his paper on "American Naturalistic Nationalism" that the "naturalistic aesthetic first took root among writers in New England and New York. These intellectuals, connected by New York literary periodicals like ''Knickerbocker Magazine'' ... responded in several ways to the new naturalistic sensibility" the influence of which can be seen in many of their published works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bender |first1=Thomas |year=1987 |title=New York Intellect: A History of Intellectual Life in New York City, 1750 to the Beginnings of Our Own Time |location=New York |publisher=[[Alfred A.

Some famous works first published in ''The Knickerbocker'' that have influenced environmental thought include:[[File:Oregon Trail reenactment - NARA - 286054.tif|thumbnail|left|On the Oregon Trail]]
* ''[[The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life|The Oregon Trail]]'', by Francis Parkman - An 1846 story of exploring the West published in 21 installments.  It portrays heroic frontiersmen, struggling immigrants, and savage Native Americans. Though it is a romantic work, Parkman does not shy from the violence of the frontier, providing his audience a more realistic view of the frontier than some of his contemporaries. However, he does place emphasis on the beauty of the conquered nature over the wild.&lt;ref name="Jacobs 1992 341–356"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Wilbur R.|title=Francis Parkman: Naturalist-Environmental Savant|journal=Pacific Historical Review|year=1992|volume=61|issue=3|pages=341–356|doi=10.2307/3640591|jstor=3640591}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Scalp-Hunter," by Francis Parkman - A short story of 1845, chronicling the young Parkman's experiences in the American wilderness. The story contains frenzied hunting scenes, dangerous rock climbing and his daring ascent of a steep, crumbling ravine. The story romanticized nature, transforming harrowing experiences into wilderness adventures.&lt;ref name="Jacobs 1992 341–356"/&gt;
* "Hints on Human Nature," by One of the People (anonymous) - December 1845 piece that compared humans with animals. It suggested that "man shares many of his intellectual and social capabilities with the lower animals. the beaver also laid up stores, the ants also established communities and governments. It was, furthermore the nature of all animals to love, hate, sorrow and rejoice. There were differences to be sure. If dogs and men alike stole, dogs did not pray to their Maker nor take his name in vain since man did both, it was fair to concede that he possessed a conscience...and the general anti-intellectualism of the piece was reflected in the remark that little could be learned about human nature from books or schools or even colleges." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curti|first=Merle|title=Human Nature in American Thought|journal=Political Science Quarterly|year=1953|volume=68|issue=3|pages=354–375|jstor=2145605|doi=10.2307/2145605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Miracle Project at Sea==
The Miracle Project linked up with Autism on the Seas who assists families cruising with individuals with special needs.  Together the Miracle Project worked side by side with this group of individuals to put together a performance (comedy/music) to be performed in front of an audience on board Royal Caribbean's Freedom of the Seas.  Practices were held daily where the individuals learned songs, parts, created instruments, and interacted with one another to put together a performance of their lifetime!  With the help of some great staff and amazing individuals the show was a success!

[[File:Blue Rigi painting.jpg|thumb|''The Blue Rigi'', {{convert|29.7|xx|45|cm}}, 1842, [[Tate Gallery]]]]
[[File:J. M. W. Turner - The Red Rigi - Google Art Project.jpg |thumb|''The Red Rigi'', {{convert|30.5|xx|45.8|cm}}, 1842, [[National Gallery of Victoria]]]]
In 1842, British artist [[J. M. W. Turner]] painted three [[watercolour]]s of the [[Rigi]], a mountain in the [[Alps]] in [[Central Switzerland]], which he had visited the previous summer. Widely regarded as some of his finest works, the watercolours capture the transitory effects of light and atmospheric conditions at the Rigi. According to [[John Ruskin]], "Turner had never made any drawings [watercolours] like these before, and never made any like them again ... He is not showing his hand in these, but his heart."&lt;ref&gt;Cook, E. T.; Wedderburn, A. ''The Works of John Ruskin''. vol. xiii, London: George Allen, 1904, p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Blue Rigi, Sunrise''''', better known simply as '''''The Blue Rigi''''', was acquired in 2007 by the [[Tate Gallery]] in Britain for £4.95m, matching the price achieved at auction in 2006, then the largest sum paid by the Tate for a single artwork. '''''The Red Rigi''''' is held by Australia's [[National Gallery of Victoria]] and shows the mountain blushed by the evening sun. ''The Dark Rigi'' is held in a private collection. Many preparatory sketches are held by the Tate as part of the [[Turner Bequest]].

Between January and March of 2007, the three Rigi watercolours were united for the first time in an exhibition held at the Tate Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/jmw-turner-three-rigis "J.M.W. Turner: The Three Rigis"]. Tate Gallery. Retrieved 17 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Turner painted several variations of the Rigi in 1842, following a visit to Switzerland the previous summer.  Completed examples include ''The Red Rigi'', blushed by the evening sun, originally sold to [[Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro of Novar|H.A.J. Munro of Novar]] and now held by the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in Melbourne, Australia, and '''''The Dark Rigi''''', an early morning view, in a private collection.  Many preparatory sketches are held by the Tate as past of the [[Turner Bequest]].

Victorian art critic [[John Ruskin]] may have been the first to describe the different members of Turner's Rigi series by their colours.  The different colours and moods of Turner's Rigi series draws parallels that of [[Hokusai]]'s prints of [[Mount Fuji]], [[Cézanne]]'s paintings of [[Mont Sainte-Victoire]], and [[Monet]]'s series of [[Rouen Cathedral]].

Turner painted the watercolours as part of a commercial series of ten watercolours.  He worked up 15 sample studies (sketches) to show potential patrons his intentions, with the hope of securing commissions for fully worked up watercolours to be sold for 80 guineas each.  He also completed ''The Blue Rigi'' and ''The Red Rigi'', and two others, as examples of how the finished paintings would look.   Most were bought by Munro, including ''The Red Rigi'', and he commissioned Turner to complete ''The Dark Rigi''.  Ruskin later bought ''The Red Rigi'' from Munro.

==Description==
''The Blue Rigi'' depicts the [[Rigi]] mountain in central Switzerland, viewed from the southwest across [[Lake Lucerne]].  The "Queen of Mountains" is blue in the early morning light, wreathed by veils of morning mist.  The tonality is built up with layers of colour wash, with fine detail added through cross-hatching with a  fine brush.  The planet [[Venus]] glints in the yellow morning sky above, where paint has been scratched out with a fingernail to reveal the bright white ground.  In the left foreground, drawn in with pen and brown ink, ducks can be seen rising from the lake, alarmed by a gunshot and chased by two dogs, to the right foreground.

==Provenance==
Turner sold ''The Blue Rigi'' in 1842 through dealer Thomas Griffith to whaling mogul [[Elhanan Bicknell]].  After Bicknell's death, the painting was sold at [[Christie's]] in April 1863 for 296 guineas to the art dealer [[Agnew's]], and resold a month later to [[John Edward Taylor]] (son of the founder of the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''). ''The Blue Rigi'' was engraved as a mezzotint by Sir [[Frank Short]] in 1910.

After Taylor's death, the painting was sold in July 1912 for 2,700 guineas, again auctioned at Christie's and acquired by Agnew's.   Agnew's acquired about two thirds of the Taylor's Turners in the 12-day sale, including ''The Red Rigi'' for 2,100 guineas.  ''The Blue Rigi'' was acquired by cotton broker [[Walter Jones (polo)|Walter H. Jones]] and inherited by his widow, Maud.  Jones later also acquired ''The Red Rigi'' from Agnew's, after it was sold to a different collector and then auctioned at Christie's again in 1928.  After her death, ''The Blue Rigi'' was acquired for a third time by Agnew's at a Christie's auction, in July 1942, for 1,500 guineas, and sold to a private collector.  ''The Red Rigi'' was sold at the same sale for 1,100 guineas.  It was acquired by the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], in Melbourne, Australia, in 1947.

In 2000-01, ''The Blue Rigi'' was illustrated as the frontispiece to the catalogue accompanying an exhibition of Turner's watercolours at the [[Royal Academy]].  The work was auctioned for a fourth time at Christie's on 5 June 2006, achieving a sale price of £5,832,000 including [[buyer's premium]], against an estimate of £2m.  The hammer price doubled the record for a British work on paper, previously set by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s ''Pandora'' at £2.6m in 2000.   The work was temporarily denied an [[export licence]] and it was acquired by the [[Tate Gallery]] in 2007 at a matching price (after allowance for tax reliefs) of £4.95m - the largest sum paid by the Tate for a single artwork.   The acquisition was funded by £1,950,000 from the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]], £2m from the Tate's own resources, £500,000 from the [[Art Fund]], and £582,000 raised from the public by the "Save the Blue Rigi" appeal.

''The Dark Rigi'' was also sold to a private collector in February 2006, for £2.7m.  A proposed sale to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, DC, was abandoned when the British government imposed a temporary export ban.

The three Rigi paintings - ''Blue'', ''Red'' and ''Dark'' - were exhibited together at the Tate Gallery in 2007, and again in 2014.

[[Martin Hardie]] wrote of Turner: "In the Rigi drawings he is the insuperable master of technique. He used every possible manipulation of brush, colour and paper, every device, every weapon in his armoury, sponging, rubbing, washing, stippling, hatching, touching and retouching, to express the vibration and radiation of light. Light was his theme."

The Trees often line streets and parks in Managua and sometimes accompany other statues, including the illuminated statue of [[Hugo Chávez]] in Managua's [[Hugo Chávez Roundabout]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2016/07/28/nacionales/2074520-rotonda-hugo-chavez-es-la-mimada-en-managua|title=Rotonda Hugo Chávez es la “mimada” en Managua|last=Moncada|first=Roy|date=2016-07-28|work=La Prensa|access-date=2018-05-12|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; which cost $1.1 million to construct, and the statue of Nicaraguan revolutionary (and Murillo's great-uncle) [[Augusto Sandino]] on the stage of Managua's outdoor concert venue, the [[Acoustic Shell]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Commentary on the visual style of the installation has been mixed.

{{coord|56.0164|N|13.6676|E|scale:20000|display=title}}
The '''Vätteryd''' grave field (Swedish: ''Vätteryds gravfält''), also known as '''Vätterydshed''', is an [[Iron Age]] [[grave field]] in [[Hässleholm Municipality]] in the [[Sweden|Swedish]] province of [[Scania]]. It is located in a heathfield between the localities of [[Tjörnarp]] and [[Sösdala]].

The grave field consists of 183 [[menhir]]s, 15 [[stone ship]]s - the largest 25 m long and 8 m wide - and 2 [[Stone circle|circles]]. Many of the stone ships are so damaged that all that remains are parts smaller than half the original size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vätteryds gravfält, Hässleholms kommun.|url=http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/skane/amnen/Kulturmiljo/Kulturmiljovard/Fornminnes-+och+kulturlandskapsvard/Vardat+och+skyltat/Vatteryds_gravfalt.htm|publisher=Länsstyrelsen i Skåne län|accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the 19th century, Vätteryd, with about 600 menhirs, was considered the largest grave field in [[Scandinavia]]. The research conducted between 1955 and 1957 made clear that the site had been a place of cremation burials. The [[grave goods]] found - such as bronze jewelry, glass and bronze pearls, and bronze wire - were taken to various museums in [[Stockholm]].

'''Well Loved Tales''' was a series of illustrated re-tellings of [[fairy tales]] and other [[traditional stories]] published by [[Ladybird Books|Ladybird]] between 1964 and the early 1990s. The books were labelled as "easy reading" and were graded depending on such aspects as their length, complexity and vocabulary. Most of the stories in the series were based on stories by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Charles Perrault]], alongside a number of traditional English folk tales such as ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' and ''[[The Three Little Pigs]]''. The first title in the series was ''[[Cinderella]]'', and over the next decade, twenty seven titles were published, all written by Vera Southgate. In 1979, with the publication of ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio|Pinocchio]]'' and ''[[Tom Thumb]].''
in the series, the look and format of the books changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweeweb.co.uk/ladybird/ladybird_series_606d.html|publisher=The Wee Web|title=Ladybird series 606d - Well Loved Tales|accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books now universally featured a green spine and back cover, as well as a standard logo. The series also broke with the Ladybird tradition of having a left page of just text and a right page of just picture, and the illustrations became more stylised than the previous editions. Older titles were gradually re-illustrated over the years. Under this new look, even more titles retold by a variety of different editors and authors came to be added over the course of the 1980s, with popular stories including ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Later Well Loved Tales - different titles|url=http://ladybirdseries.webnode.com/later-well-loved-tales-different-titles/|publisher=www.ladybirdflyawayhome.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series gradually went out of print in the early 1990s, yet the current "Ladybird Tales" series has reused some of the original Well Loved Tales texts.

== Reception ==
Titles in the series were translated into many different languages including [[Arabic]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]]. Eventually sales in the series sold upwards of 80 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweeweb.co.uk/ladybird/ladybird_series_606d.html|publisher=The Wee Web|title=Ladybird series 606d - Well Loved Tales|accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older books have been known to fetch quite high prices on the secondhand market; for example, first editions of "[[Cinderella]]" with a dust jacket have been known to go for as much as £150.

Perhaps due to the nostalgia for some of the earlier titles in the series, later editions with more stylised illustrations are often held by some with lesser regard. Equally, the original editions of the 1960s and 1970s have been criticised for their illustrations for being lifeless and not leaving much to the imagination. Equally, some have raised concerns over the drastic abridging of longer stories such as ''Pinocchio'' and the right to retelling distinctly literary fairy tales with a clear author such as Hans Christian Andersen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Lorraine|last2=Alderson|first2=Brian|title=The Ladybird Story: Children's Books for Everyone|date=2014|publisher=British Library|location=London|isbn=0712357289}}&lt;/ref&gt;
