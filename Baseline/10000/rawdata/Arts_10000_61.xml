The '''Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing''' ({{lang-ar|معبر باب الهوى}}, "Gate of the Winds"&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Photographs C_042 Album C 1905 - Syria, Turkey|work=[[Gertrude Bell]] Archive |publisher=[[Newcastle University]]|url=http://www.gerty.ncl.ac.uk/photo_details.php?photo_id=864}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an international border crossing between [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]]. It is situated on the M45 Syrian Highway and D827 Turkish Highway between the cities of [[İskenderun]] and [[Aleppo]], and is known for its long lines of trucks and buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/transport/getting-there-away#228236|title=Getting there &amp; away |work= [[Lonely Planet]]|year=2012|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closest town on the Turkish side of the border is [[Reyhanlı]] in the [[Hatay Province]], and the closest towns on the Syrian side are [[al-Dana, Harem|ad-Dana]] and [[Atarib]].

In September 2012 [[Muhajirun|foreign jihadists]] raised the [[Black Standard|black flag]] of [[al-Qaeda]] at the border post, leading to a confrontation with the Free Syrian Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Syria: the foreign fighters joining the war against Bashar al-Assad|author=Ghaith Abdul-Ahad|journal=The Guardian |date=23 September 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/23/syria-foreign-fighters-joining-war}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Syrian Rebels Fear Radicals May Hijack Revolt |date=19 September 2012 |first=Deborah|last=Amos|publisher=NPR|url=http://kunc.org/post/syrian-rebels-fear-radicals-may-hijack-revolt|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 11, 2013, a [[car bomb]] in a Syrian-registered minivan was detonated on the Turkish side of the crossing meters from the [[Cilvegözü]] customs office.&lt;ref name=bbcbomb&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21409661|title= Syria crisis: 'Powerful' minibus explosion kills 13|work=[[BBC News]] |date=11 February 2013|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 13 people—including 3 Turkish civilians—were killed, while 28 others were wounded and 19 vehicles were damaged.&lt;ref name=nytbomb&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/middleeast/syrian-insurgents-claim-to-control-large-hydropower-dam.html|title=Syrian Insurgents Claim to Control Large Hydropower Dam |first1=Hwaida |last1=Saad|first2=Rick|last2=Gladstone|work=[[The New York Times]] |date= 11 February 2013|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish government has labeled the bombing a terrorist act,&lt;ref name=nytbomb/&gt; and said that Turkey's interior, justice and customs ministers would visit the area to help the investigation.&lt;ref name=bbcbomb/&gt;

However, HTS retained control of the towns, villages and roads around it, leaving them in a decisive position. The crossing re-opened on 18 October. In November 2017, civil officials operating the crossing reported that all revenue generated (estimated at $25 million a year in late 2016) goes to the local civil administration.&lt;ref name="Syria Direct 2017b"/&gt;

The film is inspired by the 1779 painting of [[Dido Elizabeth Belle]] beside her cousin [[Lady Elizabeth Murray]], at [[Kenwood House]], which was commissioned by their great-uncle, [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]], then [[Lord Chief Justice of England]]. Very little is known about the life of Dido Belle, who was born in the [[West Indies]] and was the illegitimate [[mixed-race]] daughter of Mansfield's nephew. She is found living in poverty by her father and entrusted to the care of Mansfield and his wife. The fictional film centres on Dido's relationship with an aspiring lawyer; it is set at a time of legal significance, as a court case is heard on what became known as the [[Zong massacre|''Zong'' massacre]], when slaves were thrown overboard from a slave ship and the owner filed with his insurance company for the losses. Lord Mansfield rules on this case in England's [[Court of King's Bench]] in 1786, in a decision seen to contribute to the [[Abolition of the Slave Trade Act of 1807]].

==Plot==
Dido Elizabeth Belle Lindsay was born in 1761, the natural daughter of Maria Belle, an enslaved African woman in the West Indies, and Captain Sir John Lindsay, a British [[Royal Navy]] officer. After Dido's mother's death in 1765, Captain Lindsay takes her from the West Indies slums and entrusts her to his uncle William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], and his wife Elizabeth, who live at [[Kenwood House]], an estate in [[Hampstead]] outside London. Lord and Lady Mansfield raise Dido as a free gentlewoman, along with their niece Lady Elizabeth Murray, who came to live with them after her mother died and her father remarried. When the two cousins reach adulthood, the Mansfields commission an oil portrait of their two great-nieces, but Dido is unhappy about sitting for it as she is worried that it will portray her as a subordinate, similar to other portraits she has seen depicting aristocrats with black servants. Dido's father dies and leaves her the generous sum of £2,000 a year, enough to make her an heiress. Lady Elizabeth, by contrast, will have no income from her father, whose son from his new wife has been named his sole heir. Arrangements are made for Elizabeth to have her coming-out to society, but Lord and Lady Mansfield believe no gentleman will agree to marry Dido because of her mixed-race status, so while she will travel to London with her cousin, she will not be "out" to society.

Lord Mansfield agrees to take a vicar's son, John Davinier, into an apprenticeship for law. In 1783, Mansfield hears the case of ''[[Gregson v. Gilbert]]'', regarding the payment of an insurance claim, for slaves killed when thrown overboard by the captain of a slave-ship &amp;mdash; an event now known as the [[Zong Massacre|''Zong'' massacre]]. Dido helps her uncle with his correspondence and after John tells her about the ''Zong'' case, she begins sneaking correspondence to him which he believes will advance the cause of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]]. Lord Mansfield and John have a disagreement on the main issue of the case. John is told not to see Dido again, and his apprenticeship is at an end.  Dido’s aunts, Lady Mansfield and Lady Mary Murray, Lord Mansfield's sister, seek to steer Dido into an engagement with Oliver Ashford, son of a scheming grand dame and younger brother to the bigoted James Ashford. At first James is interested in Elizabeth but stops courting her once he discovers she will have no inheritance. Oliver, who is without fortune, proposes to Dido and she accepts, although she continues to see John. James takes Dido aside, tells her she will disgrace his family's name, then insults and manhandles her. Dido later tells Elizabeth of his true character and says she will give part of her inheritance to her for a dowry so she can find a different match. Lord Mansfield finds out about Dido's visits to John and confronts both of them. During the confrontation, John professes his love for Dido. Sometime later, Dido meets with Oliver and breaks off their engagement.

Dido is relieved when the painting is unveiled, showing her as Elizabeth's equal. She tells Lord Mansfield that the portrait commission proves that he can defy convention. Dido sneaks into the balcony of the Inn of Court, so that she can hear Lord Mansfield narrowly rule that the Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in Liverpool, is not due insurance payments for the slaves the crew threw overboard during the voyage. The ship's officers claimed they ordered this action because they were out of potable water. Lord Mansfield discovers, however, that the ''Zong'' passed by many ports without stopping for more water, before killing the slaves. It appeared to Lord Mansfield that the slaves' quarters were over-crowded, making them sick and not likely to fetch a high price at auction, so the officers decided they would be worth more in insurance payments after their loss. Lord Mansfield sees John and Dido outside the Court after his ruling and says that Dido can only marry a gentleman. Therefore, he agrees to resume John's apprenticeship in law, so that he can become a lawyer. Dido and John share a kiss, both in full acknowledgement of their romantic feelings.

On-screen text informs the viewer that Dido and John married and had two sons (they actually had three), that Elizabeth also married and had children, and that the painting hung at Kenwood House until 1922, when it was moved to Scone Palace in Scotland, the birthplace of Lord Mansfield.

==Cast==
* [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] as [[Dido Elizabeth Belle]], the protagonist. She is a strong-willed and well-educated young woman, born from Captain Sir John Lindsay's affair with a slave woman. Since her father acknowledged her as his child and later left her a considerable inheritance, she's part of the high society and free not to pursue a marriage. She gradually befriends John Davinier over the ''Zong'' case, and her input eventually leads Lord Mansfield to rule against the traders.
* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]], the great-uncle of Dido and Elizabeth (Dido's father being the son of Lord Mansfield's sister, and Elizabeth's father the son of Lord Mansfield's brother), who is their guardian since they were children, and whom they address as "Papa". As Lord Chief Justice, he is the most powerful judge in England. Upon Dido's arrival to his mansion, he quickly takes to loving her as if she was his own, despite her heritage.
* [[Sam Reid (actor)|Sam Reid]] as John Davinier, a vicar's son who seeks apprenticeship from Lord Mansfield in pursuit of a career as a lawyer. He's idealistic and passionate in his moral convictions, and meets with an abolitionist group.
* [[Emily Watson]] as Lady Elizabeth Mansfield, Lord Mansfield's wife. She is very caring toward her nieces, although she sees order and etiquette as essential. She tries very hard to find Elizabeth a suitable match.
* [[Sarah Gadon]] as [[Lady Elizabeth Murray]], Elizabeth is cheerful and affectionate toward her cousin Dido, and the two of them are inseparable since childhood and consider themselves sisters. Due to Elizabeth's father having a male heir from his second marriage, she's left without a dowry, which complicates her finding a suitable husband.
* [[Miranda Richardson]] as Lady Ashford, a scheming lady who attempts to marry off her two sons to the Mansfield girls. She feels contempt for Dido's heritage, but she's able to put that aside in order to let her son James put his hands on Dido's dowry.
* [[Penelope Wilton]] as Lady Mary Murray, the manager of the household and governess of Dido and Elizabeth. Her demeanor is firm but caring, and teaches Elizabeth and Dido the ways of etiquette, music and embroidery. She is a spinster but had a one-time gentleman caller.
* [[Tom Felton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=35112 | title = Tom Felton Rings The Belle |work = Empire |date = | accessdate =1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as James Ashford, the arrogant firstborn of Lord and Lady Ashford who also shares his mother's contempt for Dido's heritage &amp; even assaults her at one point. He courts Elizabeth until he discovers her impoverished status.  
* [[James Norton (actor)|James Norton]] as Oliver Ashford, the younger son of Lord and Lady Ashford. He is attracted to Dido's beauty and wealth, but he is not completely immune from his family's prejudices.
* [[Matthew Goode]] as Captain [[John Lindsay (Royal Navy officer)|Sir John Lindsay]], the birth father of Dido. After Dido's mother died, he acknowledged his daughter and took her to the Mansfield household, begging his uncle and aunt to take her into their guardianship.

* [[Alex Jennings]] as Lord Ashford, a high-ranked judge and Lady Ashford's husband. He hurries Lord Mansfield toward a decision on the ''Zong'' case.
* Bethan Mary-James as Mabel, a dark-skinned servant at the Mansfield household. Dido worries that she may be a slave, but Lord Mansfield assures her Mabel is free and being paid a "very respectable" wage.
* [[James Northcote (actor)|James Northcote]] as Mr. Vaughn, Elizabeth's more gentle suitor.

==Painting==
[[File:Dido Elizabeth Belle.jpg|thumb|1779 painting of [[Dido Elizabeth Belle]] (1761–1804) and her cousin [[Lady Elizabeth Murray]] (1760–1825).]]
The 1779 painting, once thought to be by [[Johann Zoffany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dido and Elizabeth Portrait|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/images/people-faces/portraits/__upload__img_200__18_dido.jpg|website=English Heritage|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is now attributed to [[David Martin (artist)|David Martin]]&lt;ref&gt;Fake or Fortune?, Season 7, Episode 4&lt;/ref&gt;. The painting hung in [[Kenwood House]] until 1922 and now hangs at [[Scone Palace]] in [[Perthshire]], [[Scotland]]. It was one of the first European portraits to portray a black subject on an equal eye-line with a white aristocrat, though distinctions are implied by the poses, as Elizabeth's "formality and bookishness are contrasted with the wild and exotically turbanned 'natural' figure of Belle."&lt;ref&gt;Bindman, David, &amp; [[Henry Louis Gates]], ''The Image of the Black in Western Art'', Harvard University Press, 2010, xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heritage1"&gt;English Heritage, {{cite web|title=Slavery and Justice at Kenwood House, Part 1|url=https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/imported-docs/p-t/leafletslave1final.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2014|publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is replicated in the film with the faces of the actresses portraying the characters replacing those in the original. Dido's finger-to-cheek gesture is absent in the fictionalised version, as is her feathered turban. The original picture is shown on screen at the end of the film.

==Production==
Filming began on 24 September 2012. The film was shot on location in the [[Isle of Man]],&lt;ref name=BBC_B&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-19872128 |title=Isle of Man praised by Belle movie team |publisher= [[BBC News]] |date=9 October 2012 |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_a"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-19542706 |title= Filming of movie Belle 'to bring £1m' to Isle of Man |publisher= BBC News |date=9 October 2012|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Andrew |last= French |url= http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/archive/2012/10/23/10000204.Oxford_is_the_backdrop_for_star_studded_movie/ |title= Oxford is the backdrop for star-studded movie |publisher= Oxford Mail |date= 23 October 2012 |accessdate= 1 July 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142321/http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/archive/2012/10/23/10000204.Oxford_is_the_backdrop_for_star_studded_movie/ |archivedate= 14 July 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and London. It is the first major British motion picture to be shot in true-4K, using Sony’s F65 CineAlta digital production camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cineuropa.org/nw.aspx?t=newsdetail&amp;l=en&amp;did=230509 |title= Belle first major British 4K film |publisher= Cineuropa |date= |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was produced by DJ Films, [[Isle of Man Film]], and [[The Pinewood Studios Group|Pinewood Pictures]] with support from the [[British Film Institute|BFI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url= http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/full-cast-announced-bafta-award-winner-amma-asantes-belle |title= Full cast announced for BAFTA Award winner Amma Asante’s Belle |publisher= British Film Institute |date=7 September 2012 |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production designer [[Simon Bowles]] created the 18th-century Bristol Docks on the [[Isle of Man]] and created Kenwood House, based on a number of stately homes in the London area.

Original music for the film was composed by [[Rachel Portman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2013/05/08/rachel-portman-scoring-belle |title=Rachel Portman Scoring ‘Belle’ |work=Film Music Reporter |date=8 May 2013 |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical references==
The film is a work of historical fiction, inspired by a painting and the evidence that Dido was brought up at [[Kenwood House]]. The relative lack of details about Dido Elizabeth Belle allowed screenwriter Misan Sagay considerable artistic licence in framing the young woman's story, within the broader historical context of the slave economy and the abolition movement.

The only other direct historical reference made about Belle, other than the painting and Thomas Hutchinson's personal diary, appear in ''Elements of Moral Science'', a 1790 work by the Scottish professor of moral philosophy [[James Beattie (poet)|James Beattie]], who met Belle and in the book states she recited poetry with "a degree of elegance"&lt;ref&gt;page 225&lt;/ref&gt; equal to any English child of her age, arguing against the then prevailing theory that "negroes are naturally and utterly incapable of distinct articulation".&lt;ref&gt;again page 225&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]], who was [[Lord Chief Justice of England]] from 1756 to 1788, presided over two important cases, ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'' in 1772 and the [[Zong massacre#Legal proceedings|''Zong'' insurance claims case]] in 1783, which helped lay the groundwork for Britain's  [[Slave Trade Act 1807]]. As in the film, he was the great-uncle of [[Dido Elizabeth Belle]] and [[Lady Elizabeth Murray]].

At the suggestion of the producers, [[HarperCollins]] published a companion book ''"Belle - The Slave Daughter and the Lord Chief Justice"'' by biographer [[Paula Byrne]] recounting the lives of the film's principal characters.

==Historical accuracy==
Sagay chose to set the major events; Belle's and Elizabeth's love affairs and the Zong case, in the same year the painting was made - when Belle was about 18. In reality, Belle married at 32, long after Lady Elizabeth was married and no longer in touch with Belle. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.scriptsandscribes.com/2014/05/qa-with-misan-sagay/&lt;/ref&gt;

John Davinier was in real life a French manservant at Kenwood, not an English apprentice lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/18/amma-asante-belle-bicultural-ghanaian-british-director-grange-hill&lt;/ref&gt; 

James Walvin OBE, professor emeritus of the University of York, said of ''Belle'': "Much of the historical evidence is there – though festooned in the film with imaginary relishes and fictional tricks. Partly accurate, the whole thing reminded me of the classic [[Morecambe and Wise]] sketch with Andre Previn (Eric bashing away on the piano): all the right notes – but not necessarily in the right order."&lt;ref name=HistoryExtra&gt;{{cite web|title=Historian at the Movies: Belle reviewed|url=http://www.historyextra.com/feature/international-history/historian-movies-belle-reviewed|date=2 July 2014|website=History Extra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the film for ''History Extra'', the official website of ''BBC History Magazine'', Walvin noted that while the second half of the film centres on Dido Elizabeth Belle's involvement in the ''Zong'' case, in reality she was "nowhere to be found in the ''Zong'' affair".&lt;ref name=HistoryExtra /&gt; In the film "Tom Wilkinson’s Mansfield finds his cold legal commercial heart softened, and edged towards abolition by the eyelash-fluttering efforts of his stunning great niece" and his "adjudication becomes, not a point of law, but the first bold assertion towards the end of slavery". Walvin points out that "he merely stated that there should be another hearing of the ''Zong'' case – this time with evidence not known at the earlier hearing". Walvin awarded the film one star for enjoyment and two for historical accuracy.

==Authorship==
Some press coverage ahead of filming, cited [[Amma Asante]] as the sole writer of ''Belle'', as well as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/belle-amma-asante-penelope-wilton-tom-felton-368382 |title=Penelope Wilton and Tom Felton Join Cast of Amma Asante's 'Belle' |work=The Hollywood Reporter|date= 7 September 2012|accessdate=1 July 2013|first=Stuart |last=Kemp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Press releases that followed [[Fox Searchlight]]'s acquisition of the film, gave the final credit determined by the [[Writers Guild of America, West]] as "Written by Misan Sagay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Cameron |last=Cook |url=http://www.foxsearchlight.com/post/3763/exclusive-belle-gallery-at-usa-today/ |title=Exclusive BELLE gallery at USA Today |publisher=Fox Searchlight |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosser |first=Michael |url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/fox-searchlight-acquires-belle/5057909.article/ |title=Fox Searchlight acquires Belle |publisher=Screendaily.com |date=1 July 2013 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Baz Bamigboye]] of ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' wrote that cast members [[Tom Wilkinson]] and [[Penelope Wilton]] had expressed "incredulity" at the accreditation decision, because Wilkinson and Wilton had "only seen and worked from a script written by Amma", whose writing and direction of her debut film won her the [[Carl Foreman]] award at the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTAs]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="dailymail-dispute"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bamigboye |first=Baz |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2426045/BAZ-BAMIGBOYE-Im-going-fired--Cate-Blanchett-spent-week-thinking-going-axed-Woody-Allen.html |title=Ouch!

The subsequent arbitration process undertaken by the Writers Guild of America, determined that Sagay provided the bulk of content used in the script, so Sagay was awarded sole writing credit. Producer [[Damian Jones]] confirmed, "There was a WGA arbitration. The WGA made its decision on writing credits. And the production respects and abides by their decision."&lt;ref name="dailymail-dispute" /&gt; Asante appealed but lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2014/05/understanding-screenwriting-credit-and-wga-arbitration-in-belle-and-12-years-a-slave-235814/|title=Understanding Screenwriting Credit and WGA Arbitration in ‘Belle’ and ’12 Years A Slave’|last=Mumin|first=Nijla|date=2014-05-19|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11008121/Belle-authors-in-bitter-feud-over-writing-credit.html|title=Belle authors in bitter feud over writing credit|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a "Certified Fresh" score of 83% based on reviews from 127 critics, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's consensus states, "It boasts all the surface beauty that fans of period pictures have come to expect, but ''Belle'' also benefits from its stirring performances and subtle social consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/belle_2014/ | title =Belle (2014) | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Flixster]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Mark Kermode]] named it his fourth-favourite film of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCWtjAN5cVo | title =My Top Ten Films of 2014 - Part 2 | work = Kermode Uncut | publisher = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lilly the cat 1.jpg|thumb|A 16-year-old female black cat, sleeping]]
A '''black cat''' is a [[Cat|domestic cat]] with black fur that may be a mixed or specific [[Purebred|breed]]. The [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA) recognizes 22 cat [[breed]]s that can come with solid black coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.catchannel.com/breeds/black-cat-breeds.aspx|title= Black Cat Breeds and History|first= Stacy N.|last= Hackett|date= 2015-08-17|publisher= CatChannel.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150906094914/http://www.catchannel.com/breeds/black-cat-breeds.aspx|archivedate= 2015-09-06|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bombay cat|Bombay]] breed is exclusively black. All-black fur pigmentation is slightly more prevalent in male cats than female cats. Their high [[melanin]] pigment content causes most black cats to have yellow (golden) eyes ([[iris (anatomy)|irises]]).

==Coat==
{{see also|Cat coat genetics}}
Any cat whose fur is a single color, including black, is known as a "solid" or "self". A "solid black" cat may be coal black, grayish black, or brownish black. Most solid-colored cats result from a recessive gene that suppresses the tabby pattern. Sometimes the tabby pattern is not completely suppressed; faint markings may appear in certain lights, even on a solid black cat. A cat having black fur with white roots is known as a "black smoke."&lt;ref name="colorfaq"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cat Colors FAQ: Common Colors |url=http://fanciers.com/other-faqs/colors.html |publisher=Cat Fanciers Chat (fanciers.com) |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ISL6nRl?url=http://fanciers.com/other-faqs/colors.html |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black cats can also "rust" in sunlight, the coat turning a lighter brownish shade.&lt;ref name="colorfaq"/&gt; Eumelanin, the pigment that is required to produce the black fur, is somewhat fragile, so the rusting effect can be more pronounced in cats that frequently spend time in the sun. A rarer condition that can also cause rusting is a deficiency of the enzyme tyrosine, which is required to produce eumelanin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paws-and-effect.com/why-is-my-black-cat-rusting/|title=Why Is My Black Cat "Rusting"?|publisher=Paws and Effect|date=2015-09-13|accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A black Cat-photographed by Rajdeep Das.JPG|thumb|A black cat "rusting" (coat turning a lighter brown shade) in sunlight]]

In addition to the [[Bombay (cat)|Bombay]], the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] allows solid black as a color option in 21 other breeds. The color description for those breeds is:

:''Black'': dense coal black, sound from roots to tip of fur. Free from any tinge of rust on the tips. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.

The exceptions are:
*[[Oriental Shorthair|Oriental]] – ''Ebony'': dense coal black. Free from any tinge of rust on tips or smoke undercoat. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.
*[[Sphynx cat|Sphynx]] – ''Black'': black. One level tone from nose to tip of tail. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.
*[[Ragamuffin cat|Ragamuffin]] – Although black is not specifically mentioned, the standard allows for "any color, with or without white," so technically speaking, an all-black Ragamuffin would be allowed under the breed standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cats.about.com/od/blackcats/ss/factsaboutblackcats_5.htm |title=Facts About Black Cats |author=Syufy, Franny |publisher=[[About.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ISnsOfs?url=http://cats.about.com/od/blackcats/ss/factsaboutblackcats_5.htm |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical associations==

===Superstition, prejudice, bringer of good or bad luck===

The [[folklore]] surrounding black cats varies from culture to culture. The [[Scottish people|Scots]] believe that a strange black cat's arrival to the home signifies prosperity. In [[Celtic mythology]], a [[fairy]] known as the [[Cat sìth]] takes the form of a black cat. Black cats are also considered good luck in the rest of Britain and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/superstition/library/black_cats |title=Superstition Bash Black Cats |year=2011 |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ITHwwRN?url=http://www.csicop.org/superstition/library/black_cats |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is believed that a lady who owns a black cat will have many suitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petside.com/article/black-cat-myths |title=Black Cat Myths |author=Singer, Jo |publisher=PetSide.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ITlNtPa?url=http://www.petside.com/article/black-cat-myths |archivedate=2011-10-09 |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-11-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western history, black cats have typically been looked upon as a symbol of evil omens, specifically being suspected of being the [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s of witches, or actually [[shape-shifting]] witches themselves. Most of Europe considers the black cat a symbol of bad luck, particularly if one walks across the path in front of a person, which is believed to be an omen of misfortune and death. In Germany, some believe that black cats crossing a person's path from right to left, is a bad omen. But from left to right, the cat is granting favorable times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.best-cat-art.com/black-cats.html |title=Black Cats... Do black cats mean good luck or bad luck for you? |first= |last= |year=2011 |publisher=Best-Cat-Art.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IU8Z7tU?url=http://www.best-cat-art.com/black-cats.html |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom it is commonly considered that a black cat crossing a person's path is a good omen.&lt;ref name="Superstitionsonline"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://superstitionsonline.com/cats/|title= Black Cats and Cats in General|date= 2012-01-19|publisher= Superstitionsonline.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150401190628/http://superstitionsonline.com/cats|archivedate= 2015-04-01|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The black cat in folklore has been able to change into human shape to act as a spy or courier for witches or demons. When the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] arrived at [[Plymouth Rock]], they brought with them a devout faith in the Bible. They also brought a deepening suspicion of anything deemed of Satan and were a deeply suspicious group. They viewed the black cat as a companion, or a familiar to witches. Anyone caught with a black cat would be severely punished or even killed. They viewed the black cat as part demon and part sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecatsite.com/Snips/124/The-Mystique-Behind-Black-Cats.html |title=The Mystique Behind Black Cats |first=Mary Ann |last=Miller |year=2011 |publisher=The Cat Site.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6208I6S7P?url=http://www.thecatsite.com/Snips/124/The-Mystique-Behind-Black-Cats.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2011-09-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These superstitions led people to kill black cats. There is no evidence from England of regular large-scale massacres of "satanic" cats, or of burning them in [[midsummer]] bonfires, as sometimes occurred elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t71.e150 |title=''A Dictionary of English Folklore''|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2000 |accessdate=2009-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the supernatural powers ascribed to black cats were sometimes viewed positively; for example, sailors considering a "[[ship's cat]]" would want a black one because it would bring good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions |last=Eyers |first=Jonathan |year=2011 |publisher=[[A &amp; C Black]] |location=London|isbn=978-1-4081-3131-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too, in the hope that they would be able to use their influence to protect their husbands at sea (see [[Ship's cat]]). The view of black cats being favorable creatures is attributed specifically to the Egyptian goddess Bast (or [[Bastet]]), the cat goddess. Egyptian households believed they could gain favor from Bastet by hosting black cats in their household. This view was held in the early 17th century by the English monarch [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Upon the death of his treasured pet black cat, he is said to have lamented that his luck was gone. True to his claim, he was arrested the very next day and [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|charged with high treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cats.lovetoknow.com/Black_Cats |title=Black Cats |first=Ann |last=Parkinson |date= |publisher=Love To Know Cats |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IX7iggs?url=http://cats.lovetoknow.com/Black_Cats |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Piracy|Pirates]] of the 18th century believed that a black cat would bring different kinds of luck. If a black cat walks towards someone, that person will have bad luck. If a black cat walks away from someone, then that person will have good luck.

Conversely in the United Kingdom if a black cat walks towards someone, it brings good fortune, but if it walks away, it takes the good luck with it.&lt;ref name="Superstitionsonline" /&gt; If a black cat walks onto a ship and then walks off it, the ship is doomed to sink on its next trip.

Black cats have been found to have lower odds of adoption in American [[Animal shelter|shelters]] compared to other colors except brown, although black animals in general take more time to find homes. The reasons given include not only superstition, but also the perception of black as "boring" compared to other colors as well as the belief that black cats don't photograph well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.psyeta.org/jaaws/full_articles/5.1/leeper.pdf|title= Prediction of adoption versus euthanasia among dogs and cats in a California animal shelter|first1= Merry|last1= Lepper|first2= Philip H.|last2= Kass|first3= Lynette A.|last3= Hart|year= 2002|work= Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, 2002;5(1):29-42 |publisher= School of Veterinary Medicine [[University of California]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060925235905/http://www.psyeta.org/jaaws/full_articles/5.1/leeper.pdf |archivedate= 2006-09-25|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blkcatappr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://holidappy.com/holidays/Why-You-Should-Celebrate-Black-Cat-Appreciation-Day-on-August-17th|title=Why You Should Celebrate Black Cat Appreciation Day on August 17th|date=2018-07-19|author=Jennifer Wilber|publisher=holidappy.com|accessdate=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some shelters also suspend or limit adoptions of black cats around [[Halloween]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/31/living/black-cats-irpt/index.html?hpt=hp_c4|title= To be a black cat on Halloween|first= Rachel|last= Rodriguez|date= 2014-10-31|publisher= [[CNN]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141031142859/http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/31/living/black-cats-irpt/index.html?hpt=hp_c4|archivedate= 2014-10-31|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; for fear they will be tortured, or used as "living decorations" for the holiday and then abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/blackcat.asp |title=Cat o'Nine Tales |first1=Barbara |last1=Mikkelson |first2=David |last2=Mikkelson |date=2005-10-27 |publisher=[[Snopes.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IXk2kbc?url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/blackcat.asp |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truth_halloween"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=74&amp;SubsectionID=114&amp;ArticleID=86024|author=Boks, Ed|title=The truth about black cats and Halloween|location=Prescott, Arizona|work=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Daily Courier]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61yCKuiNb?url=http://www.dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=74&amp;SubsectionID=114&amp;ArticleID=86024|archivedate=2011-09-25|date=2010-10-06|accessdate=2010-10-10|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytoreador.com/news/article_9bcbeea6-ff85-11e0-8a42-0019bb30f31a.html |title=Humane Society refuses black cat adoption during Halloween season |author=Crump, Morgan |date=2011-10-25 |publisher=dailytoreador.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62yLXU9mn?url=http://www.dailytoreador.com/news/article_9bcbeea6-ff85-11e0-8a42-0019bb30f31a.html |archivedate=2011-11-05 |accessdate=2011-10-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, no one has ever documented in the history of humane work any relationship between adopting black cats and cats being killed or injured.

August 17 is "Black Cat Appreciation Day." Wayne H. Morris created the day in honor of his late sister, June, who had a black cat, Sinbad. The day was chosen in memorial of June's passing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wset.com/story/15268242/august-18th-is-black-cat-appreciation-day |title=Black Cat Appreciation Day is August 17 |first=Jeremy |last=Mills |date=2011-08-15 |location=Lynchburg, Virginia |publisher=[[WSET-TV|WSET.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/611P0rdJc?url=http://www.wset.com/story/15268242/august-18th-is-black-cat-appreciation-day |archivedate=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kpax.com/news/today-is-black-cat-appreciation-day/|title= Black Cat Appreciation Day for animal shelters|first= Robin|last= O'Day|date= 2012-08-17|location= Missoula, Montana|publisher= [[KPAX-TV|KPAX.com]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140817231310/http://www.kpax.com/news/today-is-black-cat-appreciation-day|archivedate= 2014-08-17|deadurl= yes|accessdate= 2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blkcatappr"/&gt;

In the early days of television in the United States, many stations located on [[VHF]] channel 13 used a black cat as a mascot in order to make sport of being located on an "unlucky" channel number.

===Anarcho-syndicalism===

{{see also|Anarchist symbolism#black cat|label1=Anarchist symbolism § Black cat}}

[[Image:Anarchist black cat.svg|left|thumb|The black cat of the Industrial Workers of the World, also adopted as a symbol by anarcho-syndicalists]]
Since the 1880s, the [[political colour|color]] [[black]] has been associated with [[anarchism]]. The black cat, in an alert, fighting stance was later adopted as an [[anarchist symbol]].

More specifically, the black cat—often called the "sab cat" or "sabo-tabby"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iww.org/en/history/dictionary |title=IWW Union Dictionary and Glossary |first= |last= |date=2005-05-01 |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=[[Industrial Workers of the World]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IYWAFaL?url=http://www.iww.org/en/history/dictionary |archivedate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2011-10-09 |quote=A symbol for "sabotage" (i.e. inefficiency at the point of production by disgruntled workers), usually represented by a black cat with bared teeth. Also called "sab kitty", "sabo-tabby", or "the cat". |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;—is associated with [[anarcho-syndicalism]], a branch of anarchism that focuses on labor organizing (see [[Wildcat strike]]).

In testimony before the court in a 1918 trial of [[Industrial Workers of the World]] leaders, [[Ralph Chaplin]], who is generally credited with creating the IWW's black cat symbol, stated that the black cat "was commonly used by the boys as representing the idea of [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics#Sabotage|sabotage]]. The idea being to frighten the employer by the mention of the name sabotage, or by putting a black cat somewhere around. You know if you saw a black cat go across your path you would think, if you were superstitious, you are going to have a little bad luck. The idea of sabotage is to use a little black cat on the boss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salerno |first1=Salvatore |title=Red November, Black November: Culture and Community in the Industrial Workers of the World |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_M25WbGARJwC&amp;pg=PA178|year=1989|location= Albany, New York|publisher= [[SUNY Press]]|isbn=0-7914-0089-1 |page=178 }} from U.S. v.

When the [[Space Shuttle]] program naming system for missions was reworked to avoid an STS-13, some sourced this to superstition and [[Apollo 13]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/behind-the-space-shuttle-mission-numbering-system|title=Behind the Space Shuttle Mission Numbering System|first=Andres|last=Almeida|date=5 December 2016|website=Nasa.gov|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew for what would have been STS-13 (what turned out to be [[STS-41C]]) made a humorous mission patch that included a black cat and a number 13.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The mission was successful and even landed on [[Friday the 13th]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The other main reason for the new numbering system was to better accommodate a much higher number of launches.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Cats Protection's own figures suggest that black cats are more difficult for them to find a new home for than other colours.&lt;ref name="NBCatDay" /&gt; In 2014, the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]] reported that 70% of the abandoned cats in its care were black,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2709721/Hundreds-black-cats-abandoned-owners-don-t-look-good-SELFIES.html |title=Hundreds of black cats are being abandoned by their owners because they don't look good in selfies |first=Harriet |last=Arkell |date=2014-07-29 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6chEq4l7K?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2709721/Hundreds-black-cats-abandoned-owners-don-t-look-good-SELFIES.html |archivedate=2015-10-31 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a possible reason was that people considered black cats [[Photogenic|"un-photogenic"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/black-cats-being-rejected-because-they-dont-look-good-in-selfies-says-rspca-9637202.html|title= Black cats being rejected because they don't look good in selfies, says RSPCA|first= Christopher|last= Hooten|date= 2014-07-30|location= London|work= [[The Independent]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150405040719/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/black-cats-being-rejected-because-they-dont-look-good-in-selfies-says-rspca-9637202.html|archivedate= 2015-04-05|deadurl= no|accessdate= 2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, "Black Cat Appreciation Day" is August 17.&lt;ref name="AnimalFound"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://animalfoundation.com/black-cats-the-good-the-bad-and-the-misunderstood/|title= Black Cats — The Good, The Bad, and The Misunderstood|date= n.d.|location= Las Vegas, Nevada|publisher= The Animal Foundation|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161028021839/http://animalfoundation.com/black-cats-the-good-the-bad-and-the-misunderstood/|archivedate= 2016-10-28|deadurl= no|accessdate= 2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by the [[ASPCA]] shows that black cats are the least likely to be adopted from shelters of any type of cat.&lt;ref name="AnimalFound" /&gt; This can be partly because of the superstition behind black cats such as their association with witchcraft or bad luck, or because they appear dull next to more colorful cats. In 2014 [[Toronto]], Canada's largest city, held an event on [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] during which people could adopt a black cat without paying the usual $75 adoption fee, in order to encourage the adoption of black cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/11/22/adoption_fees_being_waved_for_black_cats_at_shelters.html|title= Adoption fees being waived for black cats at shelters|first= Katherine|last= Declerq|date= 2014-11-22|location= Toronto, Ontario|work= [[Toronto Star]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160410110242/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/11/22/adoption_fees_being_waved_for_black_cats_at_shelters.html|archivedate= 2016-04-10|deadurl= no|quote= Animal Services will be hosting a “cat adoption blitz” in honour of Black Friday. The $75 adoption fee will be waived from four different animal shelters across the city, as well as at a number of partner locations. The only cost to adopt a black cat will be a $15 license fee.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend had now spread across the United States, with many shelters offering free adoption of black cats on Black Friday.

With the success of the 2018 African-themed [[Superhero film]], ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', there was a fad of adopting black domestic cats as pets and naming them after various characters of the film such as [[T'Challa]] and [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ahsan|first1=Sadaf|title=Thanks to Black Panther, there's been a reported rise in black cat adoptions|url=http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/movies/thanks-to-black-panther-theres-been-a-reported-rise-in-black-cat-adoptions|accessdate=2 March 2018|publisher=The National Post|date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that usually people were not going out of their way to follow this fad, but visited animal shelters to simply adopt a pet under normal circumstances and were inspired by the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] to adopt a black cat when they see one. Regardless, to reduce the chance of such cats being abandoned when the fad fades, reputable animal shelter personnel took the usual precautions of having potential adopters fill out questionnaires to weed out potentially abusive guardians and have them read literature about the needs and responsibilities of such a pet to dissuade the less conscientious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chorney|first1=Saryn|title=A Kitten Named Wakanda?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3913">'''The Boros Collection''' is a private collection of [[contemporary art]] by Karen and [[Christian Boros]], which has been on display since 2008 in a [[World War II]] era [[bunker]] (called the ''Reichsbahnbunker)'' in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/arts/12iht-bunker.1.6105187.html|title=In a Berlin war bunker, Christian Boros creates a showcase for art|last1=Tzortis|first1=Andreas|website=The New York Times|accessdate=June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The collection comprises artworks in the mediums of sculpture, photography and painting by international contemporary artists. The works are installed on five floors of the bunker, which the architect Jens Casper transformed into a compendium of individual rooms that interconnect on multiple floors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/270277/a-bunker-reborn|title=A Bunker Reborn|last1=Basciano|first1=Oliver|website=ARTINFO}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While some rooms were transformed into classic white cube spaces, others still bare traces of the bunker’s lineage when it was used as a prison, storage facility and techno club&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/arts/28iht-bunker28.html|title=Contemporary Art Finds a Shelter in Berlin|last=Eddy|first=Melissa|date=2012-09-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each exhibition in the bunker additionally includes site-specific works that refer to and interact with the various interior spaces and their history.

The collection is accessible to the public from Thursdays through Sundays only in the form of guided tours via prior application on the website of the collection.

The current collection, “Boros Collection / Bunker Berlin #3” opened in May 2017 and presents recently acquired works as well as pieces from the 1990s and 2000s.

'''''Chichester Canal''''' is a painting by the English [[Romantic art|Romantic]] [[landscape painter]], [[watercolour]]ist and [[printmaker]] [[J. M. W. Turner]]. It was painted in 1828&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-chichester-canal-n00560 Chichester Canal c.1828.] Tate Gallery, 2013. Retrieved 15 May 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6GdxZkekp Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; and was commissioned by [[George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont]]&lt;ref name=green42&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Chichester's Canal |last=Green |first=Alan H.J |year=2006 |publisher=Sussex Industrial Archaeology Society |isbn=0-9512036-1-4 | page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently housed in the [[Tate Collection]].

The work depicts the [[Chichester Canal]] in Sussex, southern England. The ship is probably a [[collier brig]], as this serene scene had commercial purpose. Its brilliant colours may have been influenced by atmospheric [[volcanic ash|ash]] from the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in Indonesia (see also [[Year Without a Summer]]).

Founded in 2009 by Naomi Starkman and Paula Crossfield, '''Civil Eats''' is a daily news source about the American food system. The website brings together over 100 contributors who discuss [[sustainable agriculture]]. Civil Eats covers topics such as organic agriculture and [[agroecology]], [[animal welfare]], antibiotic use in farming, [[food justice]], farm labor, labeling, [[food waste]], [[climate change]], [[nutrition]], and [[genetically engineered foods]] (GMOs).

==Founding==
Starkman and Crossfield met in 2008 at [[Slow Food Nation]],&lt;ref name="Food &amp; Wine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thelin|first1=Emily|title=Kickstarting Civil Eats|url=http://www.foodandwine.com/blogs/2014/7/30/how-they-did-it-civil-eats|website=Food &amp; Wine|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a San Francisco event organized by [[Slow Food USA]] that many see as a pivotal moment in the food movement.&lt;ref name=WNYC&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Eats: Promoting Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/civil-eats-promoting-sustainable-agriculture-and-food-systems/|website=WNYC|publisher=The Leonard Lopate Show|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 60,000 people gathered at Slow Food Nation, including food leaders such as [[Alice Waters]], [[Michael Pollan]], [[Eric Schlosser]], [[Wes Jackson]], and [[Vandana Shiva]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muhlke|first1=Christine|title=A Slow Food Festival Reaches Out to the Uncommitted|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/dining/03slow.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to facilitate more discussion about the event, Starkman started a blog, to which Crossfield contributed. The success of the blog inspired the pair to maintain it under a new name: Civil Eats.&lt;ref name="Food &amp; Wine" /&gt; They recognized the need for a platform on which untold stories from activists on the front lines of the growing food movement could be shared. Civil Eats has since published thousands of articles by hundreds of writers and become a dependable primary source for [[food policy]] news.&lt;ref name="James Beard"&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 JBF Publication of the Year: Civil Eats|url=http://www.jamesbeard.org/blog/2014-jbf-publication-year-civil-eats|website=The Official James Beard Foundation Blog|publisher=The James Beard Foundation|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kickstarter Campaign==
For five years, Starkman, Crossfield, and their contributors worked without pay. In October 2013, with the goal of shifting from an all-volunteer effort to a sustainable, professional enterprise, Civil Eats launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign&lt;ref name=Kickstarter&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Eats: Food Policy News &amp; Commentary with Bite|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/708969873/civil-eats-food-policy-news-and-commentary-with-bi|website=Kickstarter|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised $100,000 in 30 days–the highest amount raised on Kickstarter at that time for an online daily news site.&lt;ref name=Huffington&gt;{{cite web|last1=Starkman|first1=Naomi|title=Civil Eats Named James Beard Foundation's 2014 Publication of the Year|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/naomi-starkman/civil-eats-named-james-be_b_5263961.html|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors and activists [[Anna Lappé]], [[Raj Patel]], and [[Michael Pollan]] appeared in their pitch video,&lt;ref name=Kickstarter /&gt; and chefs [[Tom Colicchio]], [[Alice Waters]], [[Deborah Madison]], and [[José Andrés]] were instrumental in spreading the word about the campaign.&lt;ref name="James Beard" /&gt; With the money they raised, Civil Eats was able to start paying its contributors and hire a full-time Managing Editor, Twilight Greenaway.&lt;ref name=Huffington /&gt; Their future goals include paying a full staff, hiring a reporter based in Washington, D.C. to cover food policy, and producing more in-depth reporting and visually engaging content.&lt;ref name="Food &amp; Wine" /&gt;

==Masthead==
Its staff includes Adrien Meier-Schless, who is the Deputy Managing Editor;&lt;ref name="About page" /&gt; Stacy Slate was the site’s first Deputy Managing Editor. Early contributors include Jen Dalton, Sarah Rich, Katrina Heron, among others. Its regular contributors include Barry Estabrook, Sarah Henry, [[Anna Lappé]], Kim O’Donnel, [[Raj Patel]], Kerry Trueman, Hannah Wallace, among many others.&lt;ref name="About page"&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://civileats.com/about/|website=Civil Eats|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil Eats was an early proponent of sharing content with other sites including [[Grist (magazine)|Grist]], [[TakePart]], [[The Huffington Post]], and others.

==Achievements==
In May 2014, Civil Eats was named the [[James Beard Foundation]] 2014 Publication of the Year for demonstrating “fresh direction, worthy ambition, and a forward-thinking approach to food journalism.”&lt;ref name="James Beard" /&gt; Starkman and Crossfield accepted the award in New York City.&lt;ref name=Huffington /&gt; Additionally, two Civil Eats stories appeared in the 2014 issue of ''Best Food Writing,&lt;ref name="Best Food Writing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Holly|title=Best Food Writing 2014|date=October 14, 2014|publisher=Da Capo Lifelong Books|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-0738217918|pages=21, 103}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' a collection of the finest in culinary prose from the previous year’s books, magazines, newspapers, and blogs.

[[File:Vaticana, Vat. lat. 3868 (2r).jpg|thumb|Folio 2 recto]]
The '''Vatican Terence''' (Terentius Vaticanus), or '''Codex Vaticanus Latinus 3868''', is a 9th-century [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Latin Language|Latin]] comedies of [[Terence|Publius Terentius Afer]], housed in the [[Vatican Library]]. According to art-historical analysis the manuscript was copied from a model of the 3rd century.

== Description ==
The manuscript was made at [[Corvey]] in about the year 825 by a scribe named Hrodgarius.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morey|1931|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations were made by three artists, one of them was named Adelricus.&lt;ref name = Dodwell4/&gt; It contains illustrations of 141 scenes. [[Bernhard Bischoff|Bischoff]] dated the manuscript between 820–830.&lt;ref name = Dodwell4&gt;[[Charles Reginald Dodwell|C. R. Dodwell]], ''Anglo-Saxon Gestures and the Roman Stage'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an example of [[Carolingian art]], but the illustrations follow an antique model.&lt;ref name = Dodwell4/&gt; The text of the manuscript in English translation was edited by George Colman in 1768.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/comediesofterenc01tereuoft ''The comedies of Terence''] (1768), ed. George Colman, London.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin text was edited by Christoph Stiegemann and Matthias Wemhoff.

The Vatican has digitized the manuscript and added it to its online library, DigiVatLib, as a part of its project to provide free, online access to the Vatican Library's collections of manuscripts and incunabula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.lat.3868|title=Vat.lat.3868 {{!}} DigiVatLib|website=digi.vatlib.it|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The archetype of the codex ==
Since the end of the 19th century many scholars tried to estimate the age of the model from which Vaticanus 3868 was copied. According to Weitzmann the latter is a most faithful copy of a late classical original manuscript.&lt;ref name = Dodwell4/&gt; On the basis of the art-historical data the original manuscript was dated to the 5th century by Weitzmann, Koehler, and Mütherich.&lt;ref name = Dodwell5&gt;C. R. Dodwell, ''Anglo-Saxon Gestures and the Roman Stage'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The artist was schooled in the Greco-Asiatic manner.&lt;ref name = Dodwell6&gt;C. R. Dodwell, ''Anglo-Saxon Gestures and the Roman Stage'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view dominated before [[World War II]].

In the 1960s another more detailed art-historical analysis was made. The pictures of female masks were compared with three female masks dated between the years ca. 242&amp;nbsp;– ca. 267. The hairstyle of the Terence portrait is close to the one favoured by emperors between the years 238 and 249, suggesting that models from which the codex was copied were made in the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Dodwell, ''Anglo-Saxon Gestures and the Roman Stage'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, pp. 12–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ecstasy of Saint Teresa''''' (alternatively ''[[Saint Teresa of Ávila|Saint Teresa]] in [[Religious ecstasy|Ecstasy]]'' or ''Transverberation of Saint Teresa''; in {{lang-it|L'Estasi di Santa Teresa}} or {{lang|it|Santa Teresa in estasi}}) is the central sculptural group in white marble set in an elevated [[aedicule]]  in the Cornaro Chapel, [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome]]. It was designed and completed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], the leading sculptor of his day, who also designed the setting of the Chapel in marble, stucco and paint. It is generally considered to be one of the sculptural masterpieces of the High Roman [[Baroque]]. It depicts [[Teresa of Ávila]].

==Commission==
The entire ensemble was overseen and completed by a mature Bernini during the [[Pamphili]] papacy of [[Innocent X]]. When Innocent acceded to the papal throne, he shunned Bernini's artistic services; the sculptor had been the favourite artist of the previous and profligate [[Barberini]] pope. Without papal patronage, the services of Bernini's studio were therefore available to a patron such as the Venetian [[Federico Baldissera Bartolomeo Cornaro|Cardinal Federico Cornaro]] (1579–1653).

Cornaro had chosen the hitherto unremarkable church of the [[Discalced Carmelites]] for his burial chapel.&lt;ref&gt;He had reason to avoid burial in Venice, since his appointment as a cardinal by [[Urban VIII]] while his father [[Giovanni I Cornaro|Giovanni]] was Doge had created a furor in his home-city, which banned families from holding such powerful positions simultaneously.&lt;/ref&gt; The selected site for the chapel was the left transept that had previously held an image of 'St. Paul in Ecstasy', which was replaced by Bernini's dramatization of a religious experience undergone and related by the first Discalced [[Carmelite]] saint, who had been canonised not long before, in 1622.&lt;ref&gt;See Boucher B. p135&lt;/ref&gt; It was completed in 1652 for the then princely sum of 12,000 [[Italian scudo|scudi]].&lt;ref&gt;Corresponding to c. $120,000 [http://www.thamesandhudson.com/books/Italian_Baroque_Sculpture/0500203075.mxs/37/31/ Italian Baroque Sculpture : Books : Thames &amp; Hudson&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculptural group and its setting==
[[File:Cornaro chapel in Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome HDR.jpg|thumb|left|Wider view, including the Cornaro portraits, but omitting the lower parts of the chapel]] The two central sculptural figures of the swooning nun and the angel with the spear derive from an episode described by [[Teresa of Avila]], a mystical cloistered Discalced Carmelite reformer and nun, in her autobiography, 'The Life of Teresa of Jesus'  (1515–1582). Her experience of religious ecstasy in her encounter with the angel is described as follows:
{{quote|I saw in his hand a long spear of gold, and at the iron's point there seemed to be a little fire.  He appeared to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it.  The soul is satisfied now with nothing less than God. The pain is not bodily, but spiritual; though the body has its share in it. It is a caressing of love so sweet which now takes place between the soul and God, that I pray God of His goodness to make him experience it who may think that I am lying.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter XXIX; Part 17, Teresa's ''Autobiography''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The group is illuminated by natural light which filters through a hidden window in the dome of the surrounding aedicule, and underscored by gilded stucco rays. Teresa is shown lying on a cloud indicating that this is intended to be a divine apparition we are witnessing. Other witnesses appear on the side walls; life-size [[high-relief]] [[donor portrait]]s of male members of the Cornaro family, e.g. Cardinal Federico Cornaro and Doge [[Giovanni I Cornaro]], are present and shown discussing the event in boxes as if at the theatre. Although the figures are executed in white marble, the aedicule, wall panels and theatre boxes are made from coloured marbles. Above, the vault of the Chapel is frescoed with an illusionistic cherub-filled sky with the descending light of the [[Holy Ghost]] allegorized as a dove.

The art historian [[Rudolf Wittkower]] wrote:

{{quote|In spite of the pictorial character of the design as a whole, Bernini differentiated between various degrees of reality, the members of the Cornaro Chapel seem to be alive like ourselves. They belong to our space and our world. The supernatural event of Teresa's vision is raised to a sphere of its own, removed from that of the beholder mainly by virtue of the isolating canopy and the heavenly light.&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower, Rudolf. Art and Architecture in Italy 1600–1750, Pelican History of Art, 1980,  p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Interpretations==
The effects are theatrical,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Greer, Gavin Lewis. A Brief History of the Western World. Thompson 2005 p 392&lt;/ref&gt; the Cornaro family seeming to observe the scene from their boxes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smarthistory.org/bernini-ecstasy-of-st.-theresa.html|title=Bernini, Ecstasy of Saint Teresa|work=Khan Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the chapel illustrates a moment where divinity intrudes on an earthly body. Caroline Babcock speaks of Bernini's melding of sensual and spiritual pleasure in the "orgiastic" grouping as both intentional and influential on artists and writers of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ucl.academia.edu/CarolineBabcock/Talks|title=Caroline Babcock|author=caroline babcock|work=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irving Lavin said "the [[transverberation]] becomes a point of contact between earth and heaven, between matter and spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, B. p138.&lt;/ref&gt; As Bernini biographer Franco Mormando points out, although Bernini's point of departure for his depiction of Teresa's mystical experience was her own description, there were many details about the experience that she never specifies (''e.g.'', the position of her body) and that Bernini simply supplied from his own artistic imagination, all with an aim of increasing the nearly transgressively sensual charge of the episode: "Certainly no other artist, in rendering the scene, before or after Bernini, dared as much in transforming the saint's appearance."&lt;ref&gt;Franco Mormando, 'Bernini: His Life and His Rome' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011), 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some book covers of Seminar XX have a picture of the statue on the front.

'''''El Jaleo''''' is a large painting by [[John Singer Sargent]], depicting a Spanish Gypsy dancer performing to the accompaniment of musicians. Painted in 1882, it currently hangs in the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] in Boston.

==Background==
The painting was inspired by a five-month trip Sargent made through Spain and North Africa in 1879, which also yielded a smaller oil painting, ''The Spanish Dance'' ([[Hispanic Society of America]]).&lt;ref name="Thornson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=THORSON|first1=ALICE|title=Mysterious, seductive and a little dangerous John Singer Sargent's superb 'El Jaleo' defies the curse of primitivism|publisher=The Kansas City Star|date=May 17, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hispanicsociety.emuseum.com/objects/3453/the-spanish-dance ''The Spanish Dance''], Hispanic Society of America&lt;/ref&gt; Chronologically and thematically, the painting is related to a series of works Sargent painted during a subsequent stay in Venice; these, too, include dramatic light effects, exotic models, and restrained coloring.&lt;ref name="K2"&gt;Kilmurray, Ormond, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed by the costumes and theatrical manner of Gypsy dance, the artist returned to Paris and began work on a large canvas whose scale suggested a performing stage.&lt;ref name="C1"&gt;Chong, et al, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''El Jaleo'' refers to both the broad meaning of ''jaleo'', a ruckus, as well as the specific dance known as ''jaleo de jerez''.&lt;ref name="C1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;Prettejohn, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sargent John Singer Spanish Dancer.jpg|thumb|left|''Spanish Dancer'', 1879-82. A preparatory oil study for the main figure in ''El Jaleo''.  Private collection. ]]

Sargent planned the composition of ''El Jaleo'' for at least a year.&lt;ref name="K2" /&gt; The painting was preceded by a series of preliminary studies, focusing particularly on the dancer's stylized posture. The result of thorough preparation, ''El Jaleo'' is characterized by an assured and rapid handling, and may have been completed in no more than a few days.&lt;ref name="K2" /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Sargent - Capri.jpg|thumb|Sargent's painting ''Capri'' (1878) depicts [[Rosina Ferrara]] dancing the [[tarantella]], and anticipates the [[flamenco]] of ''El Jaleo''.&lt;ref&gt;Kilmurray, Ormond, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art.]]
Almost {{convert|12|feet}} wide, ''El Jaleo'' is broadly painted in a nearly monochromatic palette, but for spots of red at the right and an orange at left, which is reminiscent of the lemons [[Édouard Manet]] inserted into several of his large paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Prettejohn, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; At odds with the academic practice of carefully modulated tones, Sargent dramatized the contrast between rich blacks and the shining white skirt of the dancer, caught in the strong footlights and painted briskly so as to suggest movement.&lt;ref&gt;Prettejohn, p. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; The lighting also creates long and eerie shadows on the rear wall that comprises nearly half the painting.

The female dancer, leaning asymmetrically, is placed to imply forward motion, from left to right across the canvas.&lt;ref name="P1" /&gt; She is wearing a large, embroidered shawl wrapped around her shoulders, illustrating common flamenco costuming.&lt;ref name="Heller"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heller|first1=Nancy|title=What's There, What's Not: A Performer's View of Sargent's 'El Jaleo'|journal=American Art|date=2000|volume=14|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dancer's pose, with the outstretched left arm, is a depiction of standard flamenco dance technique and style.&lt;ref name="Heller" /&gt;

''El Jaleo'' is the most theatrical of Sargent's early major works.&lt;ref name="K1"&gt;Kilmurray, Ormond, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of a barrier between the viewer and dancer helps create the illusion that we are present at the actual event; the manipulation of space and lighting communicates the energetic rhythms of the dance, its sound and movement.&lt;ref name="K1" /&gt;

''El Jaleo'' is an example of Hispanism, the phenomenon of widespread fascination with Spanish culture throughout Europe and America in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Heller" /&gt;

The painting has been called both an example of John Singer Sargent's [[Impressionism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Ann|title="John Singer Sargent and the Dance" by Danceview, 1992 in Critical Gestures: Writings on Dance and Culture|date=2002|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also his early affinity with the [[Realist]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbrother, Trevor. John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist. 1st ed. p. 102.: Yale UP, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Sargent exhibited ''El Jaleo'' at the 1882 [[Paris Salon]], where the painting was purchased by a Boston patron, [[T. Jefferson Coolidge|Thomas Jefferson Coolidge]].&lt;ref name="C1" /&gt; It was the last subject picture that Sargent exhibited at the Salon, and his greatest success there.&lt;ref name="K2" /&gt;

In 1888 the painting was publicly exhibited in Boston, at which time museum patron [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]], the heiress wife of a Coolidge cousin, expressed her interest in it.&lt;ref name="C1" /&gt; In 1914 she borrowed ''El Jaleo'' to exhibit in her museum, and constructed the Spanish Cloister gallery especially for ''El Jaleo'', which is framed by a Moorish arch.&lt;ref&gt;Chong, et al, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardnermuseum.org/education/exploringarchpopup.html Gardner Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge then gave the painting to Gardner, and Sargent presented her with an album of pencil drawings he had made as preparatory sketches for the work.&lt;ref name="C1" /&gt;

''El Jaleo'' was on exhibition at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C. for a short time in 1992, on loan from the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] for the first time since 1914. At that time, the painting had been recently cleaned and restored by Alain Goldrach.&lt;ref name="Sweeney"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweeney|first1=Louise|title=Sargent's 'El Jaleo' Dances Anew - National Gallery plays host to the famed portraitist's restored painting|journal=Christian Science Monitor|date=March 10, 1992|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception== 
After the initial exhibition of ''El Jaleo'' in 1882 at the French Salon, John Singer Sargent became, as one writer put it, "the most talked-about painter in Paris."&lt;ref&gt;"The Salon. From an Englishman's Point of View." Art Journal (London) 44. no. 7 (July 1882): 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson68"&gt;Simpson, Marc. Uncanny Spectacle The Public Career of the Young John Singer Sargent. p. 68: YALE UP, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics in 1882 said that the painting caused Sargent to join the ranks of the French Impressionists.&lt;ref name="Simpson51"&gt;Simpson, Marc. Uncanny Spectacle The Public Career of the Young John Singer Sargent. p. 51: YALE UP, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A critic for the ''Le Figaro'' called the painting "one of the most original and strongest works of the present Salon."&lt;ref name="Simpson53"&gt;Simpson, Marc. Uncanny Spectacle The Public Career of the Young John Singer Sargent. p. 53: YALE UP, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers hailed the painting as clever, while others dismissed it as a vagary of the artist.&lt;ref name="Simpson5859"&gt;Simpson, Marc. Uncanny Spectacle The Public Career of the Young John Singer Sargent. p. 58-59: YALE UP, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today ''El Jaleo'' is considered to be one of [[John Singer Sargent]]'s most memorable works.

'''Emergency Room''' is an art exhibition format devised by [[Thierry Geoffroy]] for artists with desire to engage quickly in the current debate. Artists are invited to contribute with art works that are produced daily in response to ongoing social issues, contributing to a constantly changing exhibition. The format avoids the need for an artist to wait months or years before being able to exhibit their art. Emergency Room exhibitions have been held in a number of locations globally.

== Emergency Room format ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Artists, audience and media have been fighting for weeks in order to get to see and participate in the new and innovating exhibition that with its "art of the news" puts the art institution itself to debate. Reuters, The New Yorker and the TV-channel ABC News are some of the leading media that have brought the story about the original exhibition, and at P.S.1 more than a thousand visitors per day have been seeing it…''" said Danish newspaper ''[[Weekendavisen]]'' in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaj M. Lassen, [http://www.emergencyrooms.org/coverage/weekendavisen.pdf "Art = Retard" (in Danish)], ''Weekendavisen'', 30 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Emergency Rooms are "carefully prepared environment[s] for hectic bursts of creation".&lt;ref name="Emergency short"&gt;[http://www.emergencyrooms.org/short.html The Emergency Room Format], Emergencyrooms.org. Retrieved 2013-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency Rooms can take place in several places across the world at the same time. When art institutions wish to host the Emergency Room format they are given a license to produce a version of the format.&lt;ref name="Artinasia09"&gt;[http://www.artinasia.com/institutionsDetail.php?catID=9999&amp;galleryID=1224&amp;view=7&amp;eventID=2104 Emergency Room Hanoi], ''artinasia.com'', October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emergency Room format involves a system which is taught to the participating artists by Emergency Room staff. The system requires the artwork of the previous day to be removed daily (normally around 12.30 p.m.) and replaced by fresh artworks. Geoffroy calls this central element of the process "The Passage".&lt;ref name="Artinasia09" /&gt; The number of artists turning up for the Passage will vary, sometimes with nobody showing up. Other days the news of the day will stimulate responses from the artists and participation in the Passage increases.

Emergency Room can be combined with the 'Delay Museum', a nearby exhibition space where yesterday’s artwork is archived and shown.&lt;ref name="Artinasia09" /&gt; This museum is no longer contemporary in the sense of the word used by Emergency Room. This delay of opinions and reactions are preserved. Geoffroy describes this as a critical way of thinking about contemporary art, with The Delay Museum becoming a place for studying the aesthetics of the fast moving 'emergency'.&lt;ref name="Emergency short" /&gt; It is recorded externally by media coverage and internally usingf blogs, webcasting and artist interviews by the Emergency Room staff.&lt;ref name="Emergency short" /&gt;

Geoffroy describes the Emergency Room as a format where artists can "train their awareness muscle", encouraging experimentation and artistic daring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: Alternatives – Thierry Geoffroy|url=http://culturaldevelopmentconsulting.com/2013/03/16/7522/|website=Cultural Development Consultation|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributing artists 2006 - present ==
The Emergency Room events involve large numbers of local and overseas artists. By November 2008 over 150 artists had been involved in the format in a number of locations internationally.&lt;ref name="Artnet remede"&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Cyril|title=Le remède à la morosité : EMERGENCY ROOM (in French)|url=http://www.artnet.fr/magazine/portraits/thomas/emergency%20room.asp|accessdate=2013-04-25|newspaper=ArtNet.fr|date=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fever Pitch: A Fan's Life''''' is a 1992 [[autobiographical]] essay by British author [[Nick Hornby]]. The book is the basis for two films: ''[[Fever Pitch (1997 film)|Fever Pitch]]'' (1997, UK) and ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]'' (2005, U.S.). The first edition was subtitled "A Fan's Life", but later paperback editions were not.

== Book ==
''Fever Pitch'', first published in 1992, is Hornby's first novel. It tells the story of the author's relationship with [[association football|football]] and with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal Football Club]], in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Pete|title=BOOK REVIEW / A twerp's best moment ever: 'Fever Pitch' - Nick Hornby: Gollancz|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/book-review--a-twerps-best-moment-ever-fever-pitch--nick-hornby-gollancz-1399-1550897.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=12 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of several chapters in chronological order, from the time the author first became a football fan as a child until his early thirties. Each chapter is about a football match that he remembers watching, most but not all at [[Arsenal Stadium]], Highbury, and how it related to the events that were going on with his life. As well as recounting Arsenal's highs and lows, Hornby talks about other football clubs that played in London.

''Fever Pitch'' sold over a million copies in the United Kingdom. It won the [[William Hill Sports Book of the Year]] in 1992 and was reprinted with a new cover and made available as part of the 2005–06 [[Arsenal F.C.]] membership pack as part of the "Final Salute" to Highbury Stadium. The book was made a [[Penguin Group|Penguin]] Modern Classic in August 2012.

==Adaptations==
=== 1997 film ===
{{main|Fever Pitch (1997 film)}}
A 1997 film version of ''Fever Pitch'', with a screenplay adapted by Hornby, fictionalised the story, concentrating on Arsenal's [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championship-winning season in [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]] and its effect on the protagonist's romantic relationship. Paul Ashworth, played by [[Colin Firth]], the character based on Hornby, a teacher at a school in North London and his burgeoning romance with Sarah Hughes ([[Ruth Gemmell]]), a new teacher who joins Ashworth's school. The film culminates with Arsenal playing title rivals [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[Liverpool F.C. 0–2 Arsenal F.C. (26 May 1989)|final game of the season]] on 26 May 1989, a [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] goal giving Arsenal the 0–2 win they needed to win the title. ''Fever Pitch'' compares Hornby's life at Arsenal and other football clubs.

=== 2005 film ===
{{main|Fever Pitch (2005 film)}}

A 2005 film remake of ''Fever Pitch'', directed by the [[Farrelly Brothers]] with Hornby as an executive producer, starred [[Jimmy Fallon]] and [[Drew Barrymore]]. In this adaptation (based on the 1997 film, not the 1992 book), the action is moved from [[London]] to [[Boston]], the focus of the protagonist's obsession is shifted from [[Association football|football]] to [[baseball]] and the story is based on the 2004 [[Boston Red Sox]] season, which culminated with the team's first [[Major League Baseball]] [[World Series]] [[2004 World Series|victory]] in 86 years.  This championship was entirely coincidental; the 2005 version was being filmed during the 2004 regular season, including scenes filmed at [[Fenway Park]] during actual games. As the Red Sox continued to progress through the playoffs, the Farrellys rewrote the script to include the historic moment. The movie was renamed ''The Perfect Catch'' outside North America to avoid confusion with the 1997 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hawker|first1=Philippa|title=The Perfect Catch|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/reviews/the-perfect-catch/2005/09/07/1125772576383.html|website=theage.com.au|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''French Empire-style mantel clock''' is a type of elaborately decorated [[mantel clock]] made in France during the [[Napoleonic Empire]] between 1804–1814/15, although the timekeepers manufactured throughout the [[Bourbon Restoration]] (1814/1815–1830) are also included within this [[art movement]] since they share subject, decorative elements, shapes and style.

==Precedents==
Already by the end of the 18th century, from the mid-1770s on, the French clocks participated of a new art movement; the [[Neoclassicism]]. The predominant style in architecture, painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts, that had come into its own during the last years of Louis XV's life, chiefly as a reaction to the excesses of the Rococo but partly through the popularity of the excavations at ancient [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]], in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349146/Louis-XVI-style|title=Louis XVI style|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the clocks also did without the excessive ornamentation and overelaborate designs of the preceding [[Rococo]] style so typical of the [[Louis XV]] reign.

The timekeepers manufactured both over the [[Louis XVI]] and the [[French First Republic]] historical periods incorporated this new artistic language with classical designs, allegories and motifs. In the case of the Louis XVI pieces, stone (usually white marble, alabaster or biscuit) was combined with gilded and/or patinated bronze, although certain cases were completely cast in bronze. Some models were architectural (i.e., with no figures) while others displayed classical-style figurines.

During the 1790s, the production of gilded-bronze considerably increased as working conditions became easier. The freedom of trade initiated by the [[French Revolution]] allowed many casters, who during the ancien régime worked in workshops strictly limited to making bronze, to develop large factories. They took advantage of this opportunity to execute all stages of bronze making within one factory and drew, cast, gilded, assembled and sold objects of their own workshops.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/20079738 Charlotte Vignon, ''Deverberie &amp; Cie: Drawings, Models, and Works in Bronze'' (2003): p. 170. Cleveland Studies in the History of Art. Vol. 8]&lt;/ref&gt;
Artisans still benefited from pre-Revolution training and worked according to the standards of a luxury art from the ancien régime, but they had better means of production and organization.

==Characteristics==
===Materials and techniques===
{{double image|left|Sketch of a French Empire mantel clock.jpg|170|Empire clock sketch.jpg|190|Two sketches representing; an allegory of "Music" on the left and the "Genius of Arts" on the right.}}

The use of [[gilt-bronze]] to make luxury goods could be argued to have reached its peak at the beginning of the 19th century in France. This medium was not new, as it had enjoyed international reputation in Europe since the reign of [[Louis XIV]] that continued during the entire [[ancien régime]]. One reason for this success is the technical qualities inherent in bronze. Cheaper than gold and silver, it is a common material easy both to mold and ennoble by gilding with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. For this reason, it became the favorite material for clock cases, candelabra and furniture ornaments. Thanks to the skill of remarkable bronze casters and chasers these objects were not merely timekeepers, but became [[objets d'art]].

This golden age ended about 1830, when the generation of craftsmen and laborers died out,&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; cheaper metals started to be more increasingly used (e.g. [[brass]]) and bronze casting entered into a higher [[mechanization]], sacrificing craftsmanship in furtherance of productivity and reduction in costs and manufacturing time.

In the Empire style timepieces, [[bronze]] was the main material used and both the patinated and specially [[ormolu]] techniques were extensively used, reaching its zenith during this age.&lt;ref name="zaandam.klokkenmuseum.info"/&gt; Indeed, the fine modeling, gilt and patina finishes used in these series-produced pendulum clocks are matchless. Most cases were totally cast in bronze and others combined with a stone base made of [[marble]], [[alabaster]] or [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]]. However, wood (mahogany or fruit wood) and carved [[crystal]] (the latter used during the Restoration) were (less frequently) employed too.

During this period there were between 40 and 60 workshops with founders, gilders, silverers, and chasers in Paris.&lt;ref name="www.uhrenaktuell.de"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uhrenaktuell.de/empire-zaandam/Empire_Pendules-Catalogue.pdf |format=PDF |author=Pier Van Leeuwen |title=Empire-style mantel clocks: A golden dream in timepieces'' (2003): p. 2 exhibition catalogue}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders usually made a wax model from a draft and from this wax model a negative plaster cast was made, which could be reproduced more often. Then using this plaster cast a mould was made, in which the bronze was cast. By combining figures and mountings several versions of one design were produced.

[[File:Protective mask.jpg|thumb|A sort of mask used to protect the gilder from the poisonous [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] fumes.]]
Due to exposure to the harmful [[mercury (element)|mercury]] fumes caused during the ''"dorure au mercure"'' ([[fire-gilding]]) process, unfortunately most gilders did not survive beyond 40 years of age as a consequence of [[mercury poisoning]]. Even in those days, they took all kind of precautions, in particular chewing bread, better companies gave them a piece of leather to be placed over the tongue then a silver coin on it and at the end of the day the coin had "turned" to gold, there was also a kind of mask devised to inhale the air from behind the head, but none of these measures were in any way sufficient.

This provoked that the use of this hazardous chemical element was outlawed by the French legislation after around 1830, although continued to be commonly employed until circa 1900 and even was still in use around 1960 in very few workshops. To replace ormolu, other gilding techniques (like [[electroplating]] from the mid-19th century on) were utilized instead.

Regarding the mechanism, towards the end of the 18th century, round clock movements became a reliable mass-produced product. Known as ''"Pendule de Paris"'' (Paris, or French, clock movements), they were an 8-day movement with anchor escapement, silk thread suspended pendulum with a count wheel striking on a bell every hour and half-hour. By the 1840s the simple and very effective silk suspension was being replaced by various adjustable spring suspension systems.

It is necessary to emphasize that unlike the clocks built in the 18th century, where the majority of them were signed, the authorship in many of the Empire ones remain anonymous, making it difficult to attribute one particular work to a certain bronze sculptor. To this must be added that it was a common practice among bronziers selling pieces to each other and even to copy or readapt others' designs. When signed, they usually bear the name on the dial and could be the bronzier's name as well as the retailer's name or the movement maker.

A small clock, usually covered by a glass bell, could cost 150 [[francs]] and 7.000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alte-spieluhren.de/empire_pendulen_feuervergoldete_bronzeskulpturen.htm#Marmor|title=Feuervergoldete Bronzeskulpturen der französischen Pendulen des Empire 1796 - 1830|work=alte-spieluhren.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; francs for the biggest works intended to decorate the halls of palaces and big houses. The total price comprised the work of the different people involved in its manufacturing process:
* About 10% for the model design.
* Casting, 20%.
* Chiseling, 30%.
* Gilding, 30%.
* The movement only represented between 5 and 10%.
This meant that about 90% of the production costs were the sculpture and the case making.

===Style and design===
[[File:George Washington French Empire mantel clock.jpg|left|thumb|C. 1810-1815 piece presenting [[George Washington]] in full military dress. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].]]

The clocks were manufactured following the style then in vogue, the [[Empire style]], a phase within the Neoclassical scope, based on the classical antiquity art; both the ancient Greece and specially the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="zaandam.klokkenmuseum.info"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zaandam.klokkenmuseum.info/ |title=Pier Van Leeuwen, Empire mantel clocks: A golden dream in timekeepers |year=2003 |publisher= zaandam.klokkenmuseum.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there were a great diversity of case shapes, the most common and popular ones were the clocks with a rectangular or oblong base sustained by four (or more) legs of different forms and patterns. The [[pedestal]] front was normally decorated with either garlands, acanthus tendrils, acroterions, laurel wreaths, scrolls, flowers and other classical decorative motifs, or depicting finely chased mythological and allegoric scenes in relief as a [[frieze]] of a Greek-Roman temple. On top of the base (in the center or to one side) sat the plinth that accommodated the clock dial, however in other models it was also placed in cart wheels, rocks, shields, globes, tree trunks, etc.

These timekeepers were embellished with fine bronze figures of art, sciences, and high ideals allegories, gods, goddesses, muses, cupids, classical literary heroes and other allegorical or mythological compositions. Sometimes historical personages such as [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[George Washington]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], philosophers and classical authors, were the main theme as well. Hence they are also known as figural or sculptural clocks (rather than architectural).

[[File:French Empire mantel clock.jpg|thumb|An 1822 clock depicting the [[nereid]] [[Acis and Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]], [[Catherine Palace]]. The respective allegoric composition in relief of the frieze, represents the [[Galatea (Raphael)|"Triumph of Galatea"]], based on the homonymous [[fresco]] by [[Rafael Sanzio]].]]
Likewise, another of the sculptor's source of inspiration for the composition of a certain design were both [[classical sculpture]]s and celebrated paintings. Examples of the first one include the [[Sleeping Ariadne]] and [[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]] by [[Antonio Canova]] or Psyche crowning Amor after a model by Claude Michallon. In painting can be quoted the [[Oath of the Horatii]] by [[Jacques-Louis David]], Héro et Léandre by Pierre-Claude-François Delorme, etc.

The classical gods served as models and symbols for the era. For instance, the [[chariot clock]]s or "''pendules au char''" were an exceptional category within the Empire clocks. Apollo, Diana and Cupid depicted as triumphant chariot drivers, were the most popular gods used. It was habitual during the Napoleonic times and particularly under the ''"Directoire"'' and ''"Consulat"'' regimes that clocks glorify the conduct of warfare.&lt;ref name="www.uhrenaktuell.de"/&gt;

More domestic and romantic subjects, like the "temple of love", gained popularity after the downfall of the Napoleon's Empire. During the Restoration (1815–1830) the representation of warfare scenes was not as common as in the early Empire.

Finally, under the reign of [[Charles X]] (1824–1830), the case designs started gradually to develop away from a proportionate and strict [[classicism]] towards a baroque style which announced the [[eclecticism]] and [[historicism (art)|historicisms]] in forms, so typical, on the other side, of the rest of the 19th century. That's why during the second half of that century and early 20th, among all of the different revival styles of mantel clocks available; Rococo, Louis XVI, etc., timepieces in the Empire style were made as well, normally they were replicas or adaptations based on preexisting models.

Empire clocks in general and the largest and most notable examples in particular from the top bronziers, such as [[Pierre-Philippe Thomire]], Claude Galle, [[André-Antoine Ravrio]], Louis-Stanislas Lenoir-Ravrio, etc., are considered more than just clocks. They are [[works of art]] as well, sculptural études, where the balance in composition and the study of objects, animals and the human bodies forms and expressions are carefully and meticulously reflected in the bronze figures, achieving a high degree of realism, perfectionism and delicacy.

These timepieces were devised to decorate the console tables or mantelpieces of a given hall or room in [[palaces]], European and American [[mansions]], houses, offices, etc. Today many of them are part of royal collections and can be seen in palaces, official residences, embassies, ministries, museums all over the world, etc.

Even nowadays a few companies replicate this style, proving that the attention to detail, exquisite taste, superb workmanship, elegance and refinement achieved by the different artists and craftsmen involved in its manufacturing, are everlasting and timeless alike.

'''Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa''' (24 November 1864&amp;nbsp;– 9 September 1901), also known as '''Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃ʁi də tuluz lotʁɛk|lang}}), was a French [[painter]], [[printmaking|printmaker]], [[drawing|draughtsman]], [[caricaturist]], and [[illustrator]] whose immersion in the colourful and theatrical life of Paris in the late 19th century allowed him to produce a collection of enticing, elegant, and provocative images of the modern, sometimes decadent, affairs of those times.

Toulouse-Lautrec is among the best-known painters of the [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] period, with [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Paul Gauguin]].

In a 2005 auction at [[Christie's]] auction house, ''[[La Blanchisseuse (Toulouse-Lautrec)|La Blanchisseuse]]'', his early painting of a young laundress, sold for US$22.4&amp;nbsp;million and set a new record for the artist for a price at auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berwick|first=Carly|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/toulouse-lautrec-drives-big-night-at-christies/22410/|title=Toulouse-Lautrec Drives Big Night at Christie's |publisher=Nysun.com|date=2 November 2005 |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa was born at the Hôtel du Bosc in [[Albi]], [[Tarn (department)|Tarn]], in the [[Midi-Pyrénées]] region of France, the firstborn child of Alphonse Charles ''[[Count|Comte]]'' de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa (1838–1913)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/count-alphonse-charles-de-toulouse-lautrec-monfa-1838-1913-news-photo/113625662|title=Count Alphonse Charles de Toulouse Lautrec Monfa 1838-1913 Father of Henri de Toulouse Lautrec|publisher=gettyimages.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Adèle Zoë Tapié de Celeyran (1841–1930).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogie87.fr/pages/genealogie-monographie-familiale-qui-ont-marque-l-histoire/toulouse-lautrec.html|title=Histoire et généalogie de la famille de Toulouse-Lautrec Montfa et de ses alliances|publisher=genealogie87.fr|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last part of his name means he was a member of an [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] family (descendants of the [[Count of Toulouse|Counts of Toulouse]] and [[Odet de Foix, Vicomte de Lautrec]] and the [[Viscount]]s of [[Montfa, Tarn|Montfa]], a village and commune of the Tarn department of southern France, close to the cities of [[Castres]] and [[Toulouse]]). His younger brother was born in 1867, but died the following year. If he had outlived his father, Toulouse-Lautrec would have succeeded to the family [[Nobility of France|title]] of ''[[Count|Comte]]''.

After the death of his brother, Toulouse-Lautrec's parents separated and a nanny eventually took care of him.&lt;ref name=TL-Book1&gt;Author Unknown, "Toulouse-Lautrec" – published Grange Books. {{ISBN|1-84013-658-8}} [http://www.bookfinder.com/dir/i/Toulouse_Lautrec/1840136588/ Bookfinder – Toulouse Lautrec]&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of eight, Toulouse-Lautrec went to live with his mother in Paris where he drew sketches and caricatures in his exercise workbooks. The family quickly realized that his talents lay in drawing and painting. A friend of his father, [[René Princeteau]], visited sometimes to give informal lessons. Some of Toulouse-Lautrec's early paintings are of horses, a speciality of Princeteau, and a subject Lautrec revisited in his "Circus Paintings".&lt;ref name=TL-Book1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ArT Blog : Toulouse-Lautrec at the Circus: The "Horse and Performer" Drawings [http://blogs.princeton.edu/writingart14/archives/2004/12/horse_and_rider.html Blogs.princeton.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728053558/http://blogs.princeton.edu/writingart14/archives/2004/12/horse_and_rider.html |date=28 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, Toulouse-Lautrec returned to Albi because his mother had concerns about his health. He took thermal baths at [[Amélie-les-Bains]], and his mother consulted doctors in the hope of finding a way to improve her son's growth and development.&lt;ref name=TL-Book1/&gt;

==Disability and health problems==
[[File:Guibert 2.jpg|thumb|Mr. Toulouse paints Mr. Lautrec (ca. 1891)]]
Toulouse-Lautrec's parents, the ''[[Count|Comte]]'' and ''Comtesse'', were first cousins (his grandmothers were sisters),&lt;ref name="TL-Book1"/&gt; and he suffered from [[Congenital disorder|congenital health conditions]] sometimes attributed to a family history of [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref&gt;Toulouse-Lautrec, H., Natanson, T., &amp; Frankfurter, A. M. (1950). ''Toulouse-Lautrec: the man''. N.p. p. 120. {{OCLC|38609256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physically unable to participate in many activities enjoyed by males his age, Toulouse-Lautrec immersed himself in art. He became an important [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] painter, [[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] illustrator, and [[lithographer]], and, through his works, recorded many details of the late-19th-century [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle in Paris. Toulouse-Lautrec contributed a number of illustrations to the magazine ''[[Le Rire]]'' during the mid-1890s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toulouselautrec.free.fr/litholerire_en.htm "Le Rire".]&lt;/ref&gt;

After initially failing college entrance exams, he passed his second attempt and completed his studies.

==Paris==

[[File:1882, Toulouse-Lautrec, The Marble Polisher.jpg|thumb|left|''The Marble Polisher'', 1882–87, [[Princeton University Art Museum]], probably painted while a student of Fernand Cormon, demonstrating his classical training&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Marble Polisher (y1992-16)|url=http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/33681|website=Princeton University Art Museum|publisher=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During a stay in [[Nice, France]], his progress in painting and drawing impressed Princeteau, who persuaded Toulouse-Lautrec's parents to let him return to Paris and study under the portrait painter [[Léon Bonnat]]. Toulouse-Lautrec's mother had high ambitions and, with the aim of her son becoming a fashionable and respected painter, used their family's influence to get him into Bonnat's studio.&lt;ref name="TL-Book1" /&gt; He was drawn to [[Montmartre]], the area of Paris famous for its bohemian lifestyle and the haunt of artists, writers, and philosophers. Studying with Bonnat placed Toulouse-Lautrec in the heart of Montmartre, an area he rarely left over the next 20 years.

After Bonnat took a new job, Toulouse-Lautrec moved to the studio of [[Fernand Cormon]] in 1882 and studied for a further five years and established the group of friends he kept for the rest of his life. At this time he met [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]]. Cormon, whose instruction was more relaxed than Bonnat's, allowed his pupils to roam Paris, looking for subjects to paint. During this period, Toulouse-Lautrec had his first encounter with a prostitute (reputedly sponsored by his friends), which led him to paint his first painting of a prostitute in Montmartre, a woman rumoured to be Marie-Charlet.&lt;ref name="TL-Book1" /&gt;

[[File:Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec 017.jpg|thumb|''[[La toilette (Toulouse-Lautrec)|La toilette]]'', oil on board, 1889|alt=A thin woman's back and hair are prominent. She faces away from the viewer and has on only a towel and socks.]]

With his studies finished, in 1887 he participated in an exposition in Toulouse using the pseudonym "Tréclau", the [[verlan]] of the family name "Lautrec". He later exhibited in Paris with Van Gogh and [[Louis Anquetin]].&lt;ref name="TL-Book1" /&gt; The Belgian critic [[Octave Maus]] invited him to present eleven pieces at the Vingt (the Twenties) exhibition in Brussels in February. Van Gogh's brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] bought ''Poudre de Riz'' (Rice Powder) for 150 francs for the [[Goupil &amp; Cie]] gallery.

From 1889 until 1894, Toulouse-Lautrec took part in the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Independent Artists' Salon]] ({{Lang-fr|Société des Artistes Indépendants}}) on a regular basis. He made several landscapes of Montmartre.&lt;ref name="TL-Book1" /&gt; Tucked deep into Montmartre in the garden of Monsieur Pere Foret, Toulouse-Lautrec executed a series of pleasant [[plein air|plein-air]] paintings of Carmen Gaudin, the same red-headed model who appears in ''The Laundress'' (1888).

When the [[Moulin Rouge]] cabaret opened, Toulouse-Lautrec was commissioned to produce a series of posters. His mother had left Paris and, though he had a regular income from his family, making posters offered him a living of his own. Other artists looked down on the work, but he ignored them.&lt;ref name="Ch4-TL"&gt;{{cite web| title = Toulouse Lautrec: The Full Story |publisher=Channel 4 |location=UK | url = http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/T/toulouse_lautrec/lautrec.html | accessdate =1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabaret reserved a seat for him and displayed his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondersmith.com/heroes/lautrec.htm |title=Blake Linton Wilfong ''Hooker Heroes'' |publisher=Wondersmith.com |date= |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the well-known works that he painted for the Moulin Rouge and other Parisian nightclubs are depictions of the singer [[Yvette Guilbert]]; the dancer Louise Weber, better known as [[La Goulue]] (The Glutton) who created the [[Can-can|French can-can]]; and the much subtler dancer [[Jane Avril]].

==London==

Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's family were [[Anglophiles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/book-review--short-and-not-sweet-toulouselautrec-a-life--julia-frey-weidenfeld-pounds-25-1412821.html|title=Book Review/ Short and not sweet: Toulouse-Lautrec: A Life - Julia Frey: Weidenfeld, pounds 25|last=Smith|first=Joan|date=10 July 1994|publisher=independent.co.uk|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though he was not as fluent as he pretended to be, he spoke English well enough.&lt;ref name="Ch4-TL" /&gt; He travelled to London where he was commissioned by the J. &amp; E. Bella company to make a poster advertising their confetti (which was banned after the 1892 [[Mardi Gras]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toulouse-Lautrec|first1=Henri de|last2=Donson|first2=Theodore B.|others=Griepp, Marvel M. |title=Great Lithographs by Toulouse-Lautrec|year=1982|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-24359-7|page=XII}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the bicycle advert ''La Chaîne Simpson''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdmart.org/collections/Europe/item/1987.71|title=La Chaîne Simpson|publisher=San Diego Museum Of Art|accessdate=28 March 2013|author=Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in London, he met and befriended [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref name="Ch4-TL" /&gt; When Wilde faced imprisonment in Britain, Toulouse-Lautrec became a very vocal supporter of him and his portrait of Oscar Wilde was painted the same year as Wilde's trial.&lt;ref name="Ch4-TL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mystudios.com/art/post/lautrec/lautrec-oscar-wilde.html |title='Oscar Wilde' 1895 by Toulouse-Lautrec |publisher=Mystudios.com |date= |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcoholism==
[[File:La Promeneuse by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.jpg|thumb|left|''La Promeneuse'' by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Oil on cardboard, dated 1892.]]
Toulouse-Lautrec was mocked for his short stature and physical appearance, which led him to abuse alcohol.&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lautrec.info/biography.html |title=Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec Biography |work=lautrec.info |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621061437/http://www.lautrec.info/biography.html |archivedate=21 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He initially only drank beer and wine, but his tastes expanded into [[hard liquor]], namely [[absinthe]].&lt;ref name="wittels"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wittels|first1=Betina |last2=Hermesch|first2=Robert|editor=Breaux, T. A.|title=Absinthe, Sip of Seduction: A Contemporary Guide|year=2008|publisher=Fulcrum Publishing|isbn=978-1-933-10821-6|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earthquake cocktail ''(Tremblement de Terre)'' is attributed to Toulouse-Lautrec: a potent mixture containing half absinthe and half [[cognac (drink)|cognac]] in a wine goblet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Absinthe Service and Historic Cocktails |publisher=AbsintheOnline.com |url=http://www.absintheonline.com/acatalog/Cocktails.html |accessdate=8 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023053548/http://www.absintheonline.com/acatalog/Cocktails.html |archivedate=23 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure he was never without alcohol, he hollowed out his cane (which he needed to walk, owing to his underdeveloped legs) and filled it with liquor.&lt;ref name="Ch4-TL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink, A Cultural History of Alcohol|date=2008|publisher=Gotham books|isbn=978-1-592-40303-5|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his growing alcoholism, Toulouse-Lautrec also frequented [[Prostitution|prostitutes]].&lt;ref name="wittels"/&gt; He was fascinated by their lifestyle and the lifestyle of the "urban underclass" and incorporated those characters into his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Powell, John |editor2=Blakeley, Derek W. |editor3=Powell, Tessa |title=Biographical Dictionary of Literary Influences: The Nineteenth Century, 1800-1914|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30422-4|page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow painter [[Édouard Vuillard]] later said that while Toulouse-Lautrec did engage in sex with prostitutes, "the real reasons for his behavior were moral ones&amp;nbsp;... Lautrec was too proud to submit to his lot, as a physical freak, an aristocrat cut off from his kind by his grotesque appearance. He found an affinity between his own condition and the moral penury of the prostitute."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toulouse-Lautrec, Donson|1982|p=XIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooking skills==
A fine and hospitable cook, Toulouse-Lautrec built up a collection of favourite recipes – some original, some adapted – which were posthumously published by his friend and dealer Maurice Joyant as ''L'Art de la Cuisine''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/toulouse-lautrec-the-art-of-bacchanalia-423646.html Toulouse-Lautrec]&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was republished in English translation in 1966 as ''The Art of Cuisine''&lt;ref&gt;Grigson, J. ''Jane Grigson's Vegetable Book'' (1984), p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a tribute to his inventive (and wide-ranging) cooking.

==Death==
[[File:Verdelais HTL Tombe02.jpg|thumb|right|Toulouse-Lautrec's grave in [[Verdelais]]]]

By February 1899, Toulouse-Lautrec's [[alcoholism]] began to take its toll and he collapsed from exhaustion and the effects of alcoholism. His family had him committed to [[Folie Saint James|Folie Saint-James]], a [[sanatorium]]&lt;!--correct spelling of the linked article--&gt; in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] for three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Clair, Jean|others=Galeries nationales du Grand Palais (France), National Gallery of Canada|title=The Great Parade: Portrait of the Artist as Clown|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10375-5|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was committed, he drew 39 circus portraits. After his release, he returned to the Paris studio for a time and then traveled throughout France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toulouse-Lautrec, Donson|1982|p=V}}&lt;/ref&gt; His physical and mental health began to decline rapidly owing to alcoholism and [[syphilis]], which he reportedly contracted from Rosa La Rouge, a prostitute who was the subject of several of his paintings.&lt;ref name="foundationbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toulouse-lautrec-foundation.org/biography.html|title=Henri De Toulouse-Lautrec Biography|publisher=toulouse-lautrec-foundation.org|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 1901, at the age of 36, he died from complications due to alcoholism and syphilis at his mother's estate, [[Château Malromé]] in [[Saint-André-du-Bois]]. He is buried in Cimetière de [[Verdelais]], [[Gironde]], a few kilometres from the estate.&lt;ref name="foundationbio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bennett"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/11/16/Floridian/More_than_art_s_poste.shtml|title=More than art's poster boy|last=Bennett|first=Lennie|date=16 November 2003|publisher=sptimes.com|accessdate=24 March 2015|location=St. Petersburg, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last words reportedly were "Le vieux con!" ("the old fool"), his goodbye to his father,&lt;ref name="Ch4-TL"/&gt; though another version has been suggested, in which he used the word "hallali", a term used by huntsmen at the moment the hounds kill their prey: "Je savais, Papa, que vous ne manqueriez pas l'hallali" ("I knew, papa, that you wouldn't miss the death.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citations.com/citations-motcle-papa/henri-de-toulouse-lautrec/papa-je-savais-papa-que-vous-ne-manqueriez-pas-l-hallali--372-351717--.htm |title=citations.com |publisher=citations.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129100920/http://www.citations.com/citations-motcle-papa/henri-de-toulouse-lautrec/papa-je-savais-papa-que-vous-ne-manqueriez-pas-l-hallali--372-351717--.htm |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Toulouse-Lautrec's death, his mother, Adèle ''[[Countess|Comtesse]]'' de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa, and his art dealer, Maurice Joyant, continued promoting his artwork. His mother contributed funds for a museum to be created in [[Albi]], his birthplace, to show his works. This [[Musée Toulouse-Lautrec]] owns the largest collection of his works.

==Art==
[[File:Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec - At the Moulin Rouge - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Self-portrait in the crowd (background center-left), ''[[At the Moulin Rouge]]'', 1892, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
[[File:Lautrec moulin rouge, la goulue (poster) 1891.jpg|thumb|''[[Moulin Rouge: La Goulue]]'', poster (1891)]]
In his less-than-20-year career, Toulouse-Lautrec created:
* 737 canvased paintings
* 275 watercolours
* 363 prints and posters
* 5,084 drawings
* some ceramic and stained-glass work
* an unknown number of lost works&lt;ref name="Angier" /&gt;
His debt to the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], particularly the more figurative painters like [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], is apparent, for within his works, one can draw parallels to the detached barmaid at ''[[A Bar at the Folies-Bergère]]'' by Manet and the behind-the-scenes ballet dancers of Degas. His style was also influenced by the classical [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese woodprints]] which became popular in art circles in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[[Klaus Berger (art historian)|Berger, Klaus]]. (1992) ''Japonisme in Western Painting from Whistler to Matisse''. Translated by David Britt. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], p. 199. {{ISBN|9780521373210}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He excelled at depicting people in their working environments, with the colour and movement of the gaudy nightlife present but the glamour stripped away. He was a master at painting crowd scenes where each figure was highly individualized. At the time they were painted, the individual figures in his larger paintings could be identified by silhouette ''alone'', and the names of many of these characters have been recorded.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}} His treatment of his subject matter, whether as portraits, in scenes of Parisian nightlife, or as intimate studies, has been described as alternately "sympathetic" and "dispassionate".{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

Toulouse-Lautrec's skilled depiction of people relied on his painterly style, which is highly [[Line art|linear]] and emphasizes [[Contour line|contour]]. He often applied paint in long, thin brushstrokes which would leave much of the board underneath showing through. Many of his works may be best described as "drawings in coloured paint".{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

On 20 August 2018 Toulouse-Lautrec was the featured artist on the BBC television programme ''Fake or Fortune?''. Researchers attempted to discover whether two sketchbooks were created by him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bgtg9h BBC - Fake or Fiction?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry-Leslie.jpg|thumb|right|Leslie in later years]]
'''Henry David Leslie''' (18 June 1822 – 5 February 1896) was an English composer and conductor.  Leslie was a leader in supporting amateur choral musicians in Britain, founding prize-winning amateur choral societies.  He was also a supporter of musical higher education, helping to found national music schools.

==Biography==
Leslie was born in London.  His parents were John Leslie, a tailor and enthusiastic amateur [[viola]] player, and Mary Taylor Leslie.  He had eight brothers and sisters.  He attended the Palace School in [[Enfield Town|Enfield]] and worked with his father.  As a teenager, he studied the cello with [[Charles Lucas (musician)|Charles Lucas]] and later played that instrument in concerts at the [[Sacred Harmonic Society]] for several years.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Holmstrom, John, rev. Anne Pimlott Baker.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37667 "Leslie, Henry David (1822–1896)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 5 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Leslie began to compose music, and in 1840 he published his ''Te Deum and Jubilate in D''.  He became honorary secretary of the newly founded Amateur Musical Society in 1847.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. Henry Leslie", ''[[The Times]]'', 7 February 1896, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His symphony in F was performed in 1848 by the Amateur Musical Society under [[Michael Balfe]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 March 1848, p. 5, col B&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, at the Norwich music festival of 1849, his much-admired anthem "Let God Arise" was premiered.  He conducted the Amateur Musical Society from 1853 until it dissolved in 1861.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Leslie's dramatic overture, ''The Templar'' (1852), was followed by and his well-regarded [[oratorio]]s ''Immanuel'' (1854) and ''Judith'' (1858), and some chamber music.  In 1855, he founded a madrigal society which grew to 200 voices and became known as Henry Leslie's Choir.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1896/02/07/104110548.pdf "Death of Henry David Leslie",] ''The New York Times'', 7 February 1896&lt;/ref&gt; He was its conductor until 1880.  The choir introduced many important choral works to English audiences, including [[J. S. Bach]]'s 18-part motets.  According to ''[[The Times]]'', this choir "held the palm among London societies for finished singing of unaccompanied music, both ancient and modern".&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

In 1857, Leslie married Mary Betsy, one of his pupils, the daughter of physician William Henry Perry.  The couple moved to Mary's family home, now known as Bryn Tanat Hall, at [[Llansanffraid-ym-Mechain|Llansanffraid]], near [[Oswestry]] on the Welsh border.  They produced four sons and one daughter.  Their son William became a master of the Musicians' Company, and [[Charles Leslie (cricketer)|Charles]] became a cricketer for Middlesex and England.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Leslie's [[operetta]] ''Romance, or, Bold Dick Turpin'', first performed in 1857, was presented at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in 1860.  After this, he wrote the cantatas ''Holyrood'' (1860) and ''Daughter of the Isles'' (1861) and a [[Psalm 100|Jubilate]] in B (1864).  In 1865, he wrote a romantic opera ''Ida, or, The Guardian Storks''.  He also conducted the amateur Herefordshire Philharmonic Society from 1863.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; He published over a hundred part songs for the choir.  Some of these became very popular, including the trio "O memory", "The Pilgrims", and "[[Annabel Lee|Annabelle Lee]]" set to a poem by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].  His output also included a quantity of chamber and piano music.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; He also edited collections of part songs, including ''Cassell's Choral Music'', in 1867.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Later years===
In 1864, Leslie established a National College of Music, in Piccadilly, and acted as its principal.  Its professors included [[Arthur Sullivan]], [[Julius Benedict]], and other prominent musicians, but the college survived only two years.  In 1874, he became conductor of the newly formed Guild of Amateur Musicians.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; In 1878, Leslie and others made another attempt to form a national music school, which was successful and became the predecessor of the [[Royal College of Music]].

Leslie and Sullivan organised the British musical presentations at the Paris Exhibition of 1878.  There Henry Leslie's Choir won the first prize at the international choral competition.  In 1880, after a royal command performance at [[Windsor Castle]], he dissolved the choir.  Later, however, it was re-formed under [[Alberto Randegger]], with Leslie as president, and he resumed conducting it from 1885 to 1887.  [[Charles Santley]] and other well-known soloists performed with the choir.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Leslie's only major composition later in life was his second symphony, ''Chivalry'', which premiered in 1881 at [[The Crystal Palace]].  After he retired, he founded the [[Oswestry]] School of Music and its Festival of Village Choirs.  At the end of his life, Leslie was ill for several years.

He died in 1896 in [[Baschurch]], Shropshire, and was buried in the churchyard at [[Llanyblodwel]].

==Citation style==
{{Main|Vancouver system}}

The citation style recommended by the ICMJE Recommendations, which is also known as the [[Vancouver system]], is the style used by the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM), codified in ''[[Citing Medicine]]''.

References are numbered consecutively in order of appearance in the text&amp;nbsp;– they are identified by [[Arabic numerals]] enclosed in [[bracket|parentheses]].

Example of a journal citation:
* Leurs R, Church MK, Taglialatela M. H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-antihistamines: inverse agonism, anti-inflammatory actions and cardiac effects. Clin Exp Allergy 2002 Apr;32(4):489-98.

==Manuscripts describing human interventional clinical trials==
URM includes a mandate for manuscripts describing human interventional trials to register a trial in a clinical trial registry (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov) and to include the trial registration ID in the abstract of the article. The URM also requires that this registration is done prior enrolling the first participant. A study of five high impact factor journals (founders of [[ICMJE]]) showed that only 89% of published articles (articles published during   2010-2011; about trials that completed in 2008) were properly registered prior enrolling the first participant.&lt;ref name=adherence&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huser | first1 = V. | last2 = Cimino | first2 = J.

==Disclosure of Competing Interests==
The ICMJE also developed a uniform format for disclosure of competing interests in journal articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Drazen JM, Van der Weyden MB, Sahni P, Rosenberg J, Marusic A, Laine C, Kotzin S, Horton R, Hébert PC, Haug C, Godlee F, Frizelle FA, de Leeuw PW, DeAngelis CD |title=Uniform format for disclosure of competing interests in ICMJE journals |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=361 |issue=19 |pages=1896–7 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19825973 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe0909052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grey literature==
The ''Uniform Requirements'' were adapted by the Grey Literature International Steering Committee [[GLISC]] for the production of scientific and technical [[reports]] included in the wider category of [[grey literature]].

'''Iranian architecture''' or '''Persian architecture''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]:مهرازى ایرانی) is the architecture of [[Iran]] and parts of the rest of [[West Asia]], the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]]. Its history dates back to at least 5,000 BC with characteristic examples distributed over a vast area from [[Turkey]] and [[Iraq]] to [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]], and from the [[Caucasus]] to [[Zanzibar]]. Persian buildings vary from [[peasant]] [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s to [[tea house]]s and [[Persian garden|garden]], [[pavilion]]s to "some of the most majestic structures the world has ever seen".&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Upham Pope]]. ''Introducing Persian Architecture''. [[Oxford University Press]]. London. 1971. p.1&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to historic gates, palaces, and mosques, the rapid growth of cities such as the capital, [[Tehran]] ([[Architecture of Tehran]]) has brought about a wave of demolition and new construction.

Iranian architecture displays great variety, both structural and aesthetic, from a variety of traditions and experience. Without sudden innovations, and despite the repeated trauma of invasions and cultural shocks, it has achieved "an individuality distinct from that of other Muslim countries".&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Upham Pope]]. ''Persian Architecture''. [[George Braziller]], [[New York City|New York]], 1965. p.266&lt;/ref&gt; Its paramount virtues are: "a marked feeling for form and scale; structural inventiveness, especially in [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] and [[gonbad|dome]] construction; a genius for decoration with a freedom and success not rivaled in any other architecture".&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Upham Pope]]. ''Persian Architecture''. George Braziller, New York, 1965. p.266&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the guiding formative motif of Iranian architecture has been its cosmic [[symbol]]ism "by which man is brought into communication and participation with the powers of heaven".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader Ardalan]] and [[Laleh Bakhtiar]]. ''Sense of Unity; The Sufi Tradition in Persian Architecture''. 2000. {{ISBN|1-871031-78-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theme has not only given unity and continuity to the architecture of Persia, but has been a primary source of its emotional character as well.

According to Persian historian and archaeologist [[Arthur Upham Pope|Arthur Pope]], the supreme Iranian art, in the proper meaning of the word, has always been its architecture. The supremacy of architecture applies to both pre- and post-Islamic periods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Pope]], ''Introducing Persian Architecture''. [[Oxford University Press]]. London. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental principles==
[[File:33pol esfahan.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Si-o-se Pol]], one of the bridges of [[Isfahan]].]]

Traditional Persian architecture has maintained a continuity that, although temporarily distracted by internal political conflicts or foreign invasion, nonetheless has achieved an unmistakable style.

In this architecture, "there are no trivial buildings; even garden pavilions have nobility and dignity, and the humblest [[caravanserai]]s generally have charm. In expressiveness and communicativity, most Persian buildings are lucid - even eloquent. The combination of intensity and simplicity of form provides immediacy, while ornament and, often, subtle proportions reward sustained observation."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[Arthur Upham Pope]]. ''Persian Architecture''. George Braziller, New York, 1965. p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categorization of styles===
[[File:Baghe Eram Shiraz.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Eram Garden|The Eram Garden]] in [[Shiraz]] is an 18th-century building and a legacy of the [[Zand Dynasty]].]]
[[File:Iranians_holding_Eid_al-Fitr_prayer_in_Imamzadeh_Saleh_shrine,_Tehran,_Iran_5.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Congregational prayer before the arched entrance to [[Imamzadeh Saleh, Shemiran|Imamzadeh Saleh Shrine]] interior, Tehran, 2017.]]
Overall, the traditional architecture of the Iranian lands throughout the ages can be categorized into the six following classes or styles ''("sabk")'':&lt;ref&gt;''Sabk Shenasi Mi'mari Irani'' (Study of styles in Iranian architecture), [[Karim Pirnia|M. Karim Pirnia]]. 2005. {{ISBN|964-96113-2-0}} p.24. Page 39 however considers "pre-Parsi" as a distinct style.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Zoroastrian''':
**'''The [[Parsian style]]''' (up until the third century BCE) including:
***[[Pre-Parsian style|Pre-Parsian]] style (up until the eighth century BCE) e.g. [[Chogha Zanbil]],
***[[Median Empire|Median]] style (from the eighth to the sixth century BCE),
***[[Achaemenid architecture|Achaemenid]] style (from the sixth to the fourth century BCE) manifesting in construction of spectacular cities used for governance and inhabitation (such as [[Persepolis]], [[Susa]], [[Ecbatana]]), temples made for worship and social gatherings (such as [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] temples), and [[mausoleums]] erected in honor of fallen kings (such as the [[Tomb of Cyrus the Great]]),
**'''The [[Parthian style]]''' includes designs from the following eras:
***[[Seleucid]] era e.g. [[Anahita Temple]], [[Mahallat|Khorheh]],
***[[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] era e.g. [[Hatra]], the royal compounds at [[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nysa]],
***[[Sassanid]] era e.g. [[Ghal'eh Dokhtar]], the [[Taq-i Kisra]], [[Bishapur]], [[Derbent|Darband]] (Derbent).
*'''Islamic''':
**'''The [[Khorasani style]]''' (from the late 7th until the end of the 10th century CE), e.g. [[Jameh Mosque of Nain]] and [[Jameh Mosque of Isfahan]],
**'''The [[Razi style]]''' (from the 11th century to the Mongol invasion period) which includes the methods and devices of the following periods:
***[[Samanid]] period, e.g. [[Samanid Mausoleum]],
***[[Ziyarid]] period, e.g. [[Gonbad-e Qabus (tower)|Gonbad-e Qabus]],
***[[Seljukid]] period, e.g. [[Kharraqan towers]],
**'''The [[Azari style]]''' (from the late 13th century to the appearance of the Safavid Dynasty in the 16th century), e.g. [[Soltaniyeh]], [[Arg e Tabriz|Arg-i Alishah]], [[Jameh Mosque of Varamin]], [[Goharshad Mosque]], [[Bibi Khanum mosque]] in [[Samarqand]], tomb of [[Abdas-Samad Esfahani|Abdas-Samad]], [[Gur-e Amir]], [[Jameh mosque of Yazd]]
**'''The [[Isfahani style]]''' spanning through the [[Safavid]], [[Afsharid]], [[Zand dynasty|Zand]], and [[Qajarid]] dynasties starting from the 16th century onward, e.g. [[Chehelsotoon]], [[Ālī Qāpū|Ali Qapu]], [[Agha Bozorg Mosque, Kashan]], [[Shah Mosque]], [[Sheikh Lotf Allah Mosque]] in [[Naqsh-i Jahan Square]].

===Materials===
Available building materials dictate major forms in traditional Iranian architecture. Heavy [[clay]]s, readily available at various places throughout the plateau, have encouraged the development of the most primitive of all building techniques, molded [[mud]], compressed as solidly as possible, and allowed to dry. This technique, used in Iran from ancient times, has never been completely abandoned. The abundance of heavy plastic earth, in conjunction with a tenacious lime [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]], also facilitated the development and use of [[brick]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Upham Pope]]. ''Persian Architecture''. George Braziller, New York, 1965. p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry===
Iranian architecture makes use of abundant symbolic geometry, using pure forms such as circles and squares, and plans are based on often symmetrical layouts featuring rectangular courtyards and halls.

===Design===
Certain design elements of Persian architecture have persisted throughout the [[history of Iran]]. The most striking are a marked feeling for [[Measurement|scale]] and a discerning use of simple and massive forms. The consistency of decorative preferences, the high-arched [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] set within a [[Alcove (architecture)|recess]], [[column]]s with bracket capitals, and recurrent types of plan and elevation can also be mentioned. Through the ages these elements have recurred in completely different types of buildings, constructed for various programs and under the patronage of [[List of kings of Persia|a long succession of rulers]].

[[File:Perspolis.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Persian-style column, as seen in Persepolis.]]
The columned [[porch]], or ''[[talar]]'', seen in the rock-cut tombs near [[Persepolis]], reappear in [[Sassanid]] temples, and in late Islamic times it was used as the portico of a palace or mosque, and adapted even to the architecture of roadside tea-houses. Similarly, the [[dome]] on four arches, so characteristic of Sassanid times, is a still to be found in many cemeteries and [[Imamzadeh]]s across [[Iran]] today. The notion of earthly towers reaching up toward the sky to mingle with the divine towers of heaven lasted into the 19th century, while the interior court and pool, the angled entrance and extensive decoration are ancient, but still common, features of Iranian architecture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The pre-Islamic styles draw on 3000 to 4000 years of architectural development from various civilizations of the Iranian plateau. The post-[[Islam]]ic architecture of [[Iran]] in turn, draws ideas from its pre-Islamic predecessor, and has geometrical and repetitive forms, as well as surfaces that are richly decorated with glazed tiles, carved [[stucco]], patterned brickwork, floral [[motif (art)|motifs]], and [[calligraphy]].

Iran is recognized by [[UNESCO]] as being one of the [[cradle of civilization|cradles of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2631/pdf/i12.pdf ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928124326/http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2631/pdf/i12.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the periods of [[Elam]]ites, [[Achaemenid]]s, [[Parthia]]ns and [[Sassanid]]s were creators of great architecture that, over the ages, spread far and wide far to other cultures. Although Iran has suffered its share of destruction, including [[Alexander The Great]]'s decision to burn [[Persepolis]], there are sufficient remains to form a picture of its classical architecture.

The [[Achaemenid]]s built on a grand scale. The artists and materials they used were brought in from practically all territories of what was then the largest state in the world. [[Pasargadae]] set the standard: its city was laid out in an extensive park with bridges, gardens, [[colonnade]]d palaces and open column pavilions. Pasargadae along with [[Susa]] and [[Persepolis]] expressed the authority of ''The King of Kings'', the staircases of the latter recording in relief sculpture the vast extent of the imperial frontier.

With the emergence of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and [[Sassanid]]s new forms appeared. Parthian innovations fully flowered during the [[Sassanid]] period with massive [[barrel-vault]]ed chambers, solid masonry domes and tall columns. This influence was to remain for years to come.

For example, the roundness of the city of [[Round City of Baghdad|Baghdad]] in the [[Abbasid]] era, points to its Persian precedents, such as [[Firouzabad]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam Art and Architecture |first=Markus |last=Hattstein |first2=Peter |last2=Delius |year=2000 |page=96 |isbn=3-8290-2558-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Mansur]] hired two designers to plan the city's design: [[Naubakht]], a former [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Zoroastrian]] who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city should be astrologically significant, and [[Mashallah ibn Athari]], a former Jew from [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Islamic Science and Engineering |first=Donald R. |last=Hill |year=1994 |page=10 |isbn=0-7486-0457-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruins of [[Persepolis]], [[Ctesiphon]], [[Sialk]], [[Pasargadae]], [[Firouzabad]], and [[Arg-é Bam]] give us a distant glimpse of what contributions Persians made to the art of building. The imposing Sassanid castle built at [[Derbent]], [[Dagestan]] (now a part of Russia) is one of the most extant and living examples of splendid Sassanid Iranian architecture. Since 2003, the Sassanid castle has been listed on Russia's UNESCO World Heritage list.

==Islamic architecture of Persia==
[[File:Teemcheh.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Timcheh-e-Aminoddowleh]]'', Bazaar of [[Kashan]].]]
The fall of the [[Sassanian]] dynasty to the invading Muslim [[Arabs]] led to the adaptation of Persian architectural forms for Islamic religious buildings in Iran. Arts such as calligraphy, stucco work, mirror work and mosaics became closely tied with the architecture of mosques in Persia ''(Iran)''. An example is the round-domed rooftops which originate in the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] ''(Ashkanid)'' dynasty of Iran.

Archaeological excavations have provided extensive evidence supporting the impact of Sassanid architecture on the architecture of the Islamic world at large. 

Many experts believe the period of Persian architecture from the 15th through 17th centuries CE to be the pinnacle of the post-Islamic era. Various structures such as mosques, mausoleums, [[bazaar]]s, bridges and palaces have survived from this period.

[[Safavid]] [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] tried to achieve grandeur in scale (Isfahan's [[Naghsh-i Jahan Square]] is the sixth [[List of city squares by size|largest square]] worldwide), by constructing tall buildings with vast inner spaces. However, the quality of ornaments was less compared to those of the 14th and 15th centuries.

Another aspect of this architecture was the harmony with the people, their environment, and the beliefs that it represented. At the same time no strict rules were applied to govern this form of Islamic architecture.

The great mosques of [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], [[Isfahan]] and [[Tabriz]] each used local geometry, local materials and local building methods to express, each in their own way, the order, harmony, and unity of Islamic architecture. When the major monuments of Islamic Persian architecture are examined, they reveal complex geometrical relationships, a studied hierarchy of form and ornament and great depths of symbolic meaning.

In the words of [[Arthur Pope|Arthur U. Pope]], who carried out extensive studies in ancient Persian and Islamic buildings:

:''"The meaningful Impact of Persian architecture is versatile. Not overwhelming but dignified, magnificent and impressive."''

However, Pope's approach toward Qajar art and architecture is quite negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassan Pour|title=The Theoretical Inapplicability of Regionalism to Analysing Architectural Aspects of Islamic Shrines in Iran in the Last Two Centuries|journal=The Collection of articles of the International Congress of Imam's Descendants (Imamzadegan)|year=2013|volume=4|pages=16–32|url=http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/18145|trans-title=کاربست ناپذیری نظری رجینالیسم در تحلیل معماری اسلامی ایران در دو قرن گذشته|publisher=The Charity Organisation|location=Esfahan, Iran|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persian domes==
{{main|History of Persian domes}}
{{see also|Gonbad}}
[[File:Ardeshir.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The ancient [[Palace of Ardashir]], constructed in 224 during the [[Sassanid Dynasty]]. The building has three large domes, among the oldest examples of such large-scale domes in the World.]]
The [[Sassanid Empire]] initiated the construction of the first large-scale domes in [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]), with such royal buildings as the [[Palace of Ardashir]] and [[Ghal'eh Dokhtar|Dezh Dokhtar]]. After the Muslim conquest of the Sassanid Empire, the Persian architectural style became a major influence on Islamic societies and the dome also became a feature of [[Islamic architecture|Muslim architecture]] (see ''[[gonbad]]'').

The [[Ilkhanate|Il-Khanate period]] provided several innovations to dome-building that eventually enabled the Persians to construct much taller structures. These changes later paved the way for Safavid architecture. The pinnacle of Il-Khanate architecture was reached with the construction of the [[Soltaniyeh|Soltaniyeh Dome]] (1302–1312) in [[Zanjan (city)|Zanjan]], Iran, which measures 50 m in height and 25 m in diameter, making it [[List of largest domes in the world#Masonry|the 3rd largest]] and the tallest masonry dome ever erected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranreview.org/content/view/2280/51/ ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thin, double-shelled dome was reinforced by arches between the layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/domes |title=Encyclopædia Iranica &amp;#124; Articles |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=1995-12-15 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renaissance in Persian mosque and dome building came during the [[Safavid dynasty]], when [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]], in 1598, initiated the reconstruction of [[Isfahan]], with the [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]] as the centerpiece of his new capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Savory |first=Roger |title=Iran under the Safavids |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=155 |year=1980 |isbn=0-521-22483-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Architecturally they borrowed heavily from Il-Khanate designs, but artistically they elevated the designs to a new level. 

The distinct feature of Persian domes, which separates them from those domes created in the Christian world or the Ottoman and Mughal empires, was the use of colourful tiles, with which the exterior of domes are covered much like the interior. These domes soon numbered dozens in Isfahan and the distinct blue shape would dominate the skyline of the city. Reflecting the light of the sun, these domes appeared like glittering [[turquoise|turquoise gem]]s and could be seen from miles away by travelers following the [[Silk road]] through Persia.

This very distinct style of architecture was inherited from the [[Seljuq dynasty]], who for centuries had used it in their mosque building, but it was perfected during the Safavids when they invented the ''haft- rangi'', or seven colour style of tile burning, a process that enabled them to apply more colours to each tile, creating richer patterns, sweeter to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blake |first=Stephen P. |title=Half the World, The Social Architecture of Safavid Isfahan, 1590–1722 |location=Costa Mesa |publisher=Mazda |pages=143–144 |isbn=1-56859-087-3 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The colours that the Persians favoured were gold, white and turquoise patterns on a dark-blue background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Canby |first=Sheila R. |title=Shah Abbas, The Remaking of Iran |location=London |publisher=British Museum Press |page=30 |isbn=978-0-7141-2456-8 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive inscription bands of calligraphy and arabesque on most of the major buildings where carefully planned and executed by [[Reza Abbasi|Ali Reza Abbasi]], who was appointed head of the royal library and Master calligrapher at the Shah's court in 1598,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Canby |first=Sheila R. |title=Shah Abbas, The Remaking of Iran |page=36 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Shaykh Bahai]] oversaw the construction projects. Reaching 53 meters in height, the dome of Masjed-e Shah (Shah Mosque) would become the tallest in the city when it was finished in 1629. It was built as a double-shelled dome, spanning 14 m between the two layers and resting on an octagonal dome chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hattstein |first=M. |last2=Delius |first2=P. |title=Islam, Art and Architecture |location=Cologne |publisher=Köneman |isbn=3-8290-2558-0 |year=2000 |pages=513–514 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Iranian architecture in and outside Iran==

Contemporary architecture in Iran begins with the advent of the first Pahlavi period in the early 1920s. Some designers, such as [[Andre Godard]], created works such as the [[National Museum of Iran]] that were reminiscent of Iran's historical architectural heritage. Others made an effort to merge the traditional elements with modern designs in their works. The [[Tehran University]] main campus is one such example. Others, such as [[Heydar Ghiai]] and [[Houshang Seyhoun]], have tried to create completely original works, independent of prior influences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ubc.ca/parsia/files/2008/12/dpc14421.pdf Trends in Modern Iranian Architecture.] By Darab DIBA and Mozayan DEHBASHI.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Dariush Borbor]]'s architecture successfully combined modern architecture with local vernacular&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_X0UAQAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=borbor |title=Architecture: formes + fonctions |website==Books.google.com |date=2010-11-10 |accessdate=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Michel Ragon, ''Histoire Mondiale de l'Architecture et de l'Urbanisme Modernes'', vol. 2, Casterman, Paris, 1972, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Future architecture in Iran==
[[File:اصفهان سیتی سنتر.JPG|thumb|[[Isfahan City Center]] concept]]
[[File:IsfahanCityCenter outside night.JPG|thumb|[[Isfahan City Center]] at night]]
Major construction projects are underway all around Iran. Iran is developing [[Isfahan City Center]], which is the largest mall in Iran and the largest mall with a museum in the world. It includes a hotel, indoor amusement park, and food court, among other amenities. The [[Flower of the East]] Development Project is another grand project on [[Kish Island]] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. The project, includes one '7-star' and two '5-star' hotels, three residential areas, villas and apartment complexes, coffee shops, luxury showrooms and stores, sports facilities and a marina.

==Iranian architects==

:''See main articles: [[List of historical Iranian architects]] and [[List of Iranian architects]]''

Persian architects were highly sought in the old days, before the advent of [[Modern Architecture]]. For example, Badreddin Tabrizi built the tomb of [[Rumi]] in [[Konya]] in 1273 AD, while Ostad Isa Shirazi is most often credited as the chief architect (or plan drawer) of the [[Taj Mahal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/taj_mahal/tlevel_2/t3build_design.html See PBS article]&lt;/ref&gt; These artisans were also highly instrumental in the designs of such edifices as [[Baku]], Afghanistan's Minaret of Jam, The [[Soltaniyeh|Sultaniyeh Dome]], or [[Tamerlane]]'s tomb in [[Samarkand]], among many others.

==UNESCO designated World Heritage Sites==

The '''Kardorf remains''' are the bodies of more than 30 [[Neolithic]] humans who were buried in the vicinity of  [[Karsdorf]], [[Sachsen-Anhalt]], [[Germany]].

Two males, known as KAR6 (or I0795) and KAR16a (I0797), have been of great interest to scholars as the subject of successful [[Y-DNA]] analysis. Both have been found to belong to subclades of [[Y-DNA]] [[Haplogroup T-L206 (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup T1]],&lt;ref&gt;http://isogg.org/tree/ISOGG_HapgrpT.html&lt;/ref&gt; which is rare in modern populations. These ancient specimens' [[mtDNA]] haplogroups have been found to be [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)#H1|H1*]] (H1au1b) and [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)#H22 through H95a|H46b]]. Their autosomal ancestral components also consist of around 70% "Western European Hunter-Gatherer" (WHG) and 30% "Basal Eurasian".&lt;ref name="Haak2015"/&gt; Both men lived 7500–6800 BP and belonged to the [[Linear Pottery culture|''Linienbandkeramische Kultur'']] ("Linear band pottery culture"; LBK).

Particular LBK groups were singled out for as yet unknown reasons, attacked with brute force, and annihilated by others, probably close neighbors and very likely other LBK groups of the wider region. As has been shown, even within the overall quite homogenous-appearing LBK, recognizable boundaries did exist in many places. These borders most probably were a result of the spread of different groups without close social or biological kinship ties to one another who came into close contact as a consequence of the LBK colonization pattern. In fact, because the LBK was the first complete Neolithic culture in Central Europe, today all farmers of this time and region are classified as members of the LBK by default, regardless of how these people defined themselves and how they differentiated themselves from their contemporaries.&lt;/small&gt;

Located in the valley of Unstrut, Burgenlandkreis, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, the Karsdorf sits is characterized by alluvial [[loess]]. The place itself was settled intensively since the earliest phase of the [[Linear Pottery culture]] (LBK) in the region. The settlement area is at least 50 acres in size and nearly 30 houses have been excavated. So-called ‘settlement burials’ were regularly found in pits in the center of the settlement area, of which individual KAR6/I0795 (feature 170, 5207-5070 calBCE, MAMS 22823) was sampled for this study.&lt;ref name="Haak2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haak | first1 = Wolfgang | display-authors = etal   | year = 2015 | title = Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe | journal = Nature | volume =  522| issue = | pages = 207–211| doi=10.1038/nature14317 | pmid=25731166 | pmc=5048219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Batini2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batini | first1 = Chiara | display-authors = etal   | year = 2015 | title = Large-scale recent expansion of European patrilineages shown by population resequencing | journal = Nature Communications | volume =  6| issue = | pages = 7152| doi=10.1038/ncomms8152 | pmid=25988751 | pmc=4441248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LBK settlement of Karsdorf (Burgenlandkreis, Saxony-Anhalt) is located approximately 100&amp;nbsp;km south of Derenburg and Halberstadt, on the river Unstrut, and was occupied between 5240 and 5000 BC (Behnke, 2007). The reasons why this early Neolithic settlement was abandoned are unclear. The Neolithic buildings (n=24) of three settlement stages are dated to the early and middle LBK (after Meier-Arendt 1966). Except for four graves, all of the 30 burials are associated in groups next to houses in the centre of the settlement, similar to the site of Halberstadt. The individuals are buried in house-flanking pit graves at the western side of the houses and mostly arranged in north-east or north-west orientation. Grave goods are sparse; few graves contained more than one pot or a shell or horn pendant. Associated with every house group we{{Who|date=June 2016}} can identify a person with outstanding grave inventory, who may represent a founding generation.|Oelze ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |author=Oelze |title=Mobility and diet in Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age Germany : evidence from multiple isotope analysis |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/19045/PhD%20thesis_Vicky%20Oelze_2012_MPI-EVA%5B1%5D.pdf?sequence=19  |type=PhD Thesis |publisher= Leiden University |date=June 2012 |hdl=1887/19045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burials==
A special feature of the LBK site at Karsdorf is graves associated with particular houses, which can therefore be regarded as settlement burials.

Most of the individuals were buried in a flexed position, oriented to the north-east or north-west. Six individuals were inhumed in supine and four in prone position, of which only three showed a fully stretched body.

The LBK in Karsdorf is represented by 24 [[Neolithic long house|longhouses]] oriented north-west–south-east. The assemblage is composed of 20 adults (55% males and 35% females), one juvenile (15–18 years), four as infants of 7–14 years and six infants of 0–6 years.  The maximum age at death of males ranged between 40 and 59 years and of females 40–49 years respectively. The oldest individual is a woman with 65–75 years. In association with the house S and H, women, men, and children were buried together, in some cases even in the same pit. The furnishing of the graves at Karsdorf can be regarded as rather sparse. Only 9 out of 34 burials contained grave goods, such as an axe in a man’s grave and a shell buried with a woman, imply sex-specific grave furnishings.

The large variability and the sparse indications for maternal kinship suggest a dynamic and mobile group of which several members were buried elsewhere and/or which integrated individuals who originated from other communities. These integrated individuals could be mostly females due to the high indications for paternal kinship among the analysed individuals.

==Isotope analysis==
According to Sr isotope ratios, there are two distinct groups of individuals in Karsdorf but none of both are specially 'exotic'. So, there is no indication of individuals who grew up in geologically distinct uplands or further north in central Germany.

The first group, composed of the majority of the males, could have grown up in households that cultivated plots on calcareous soils, very probably in the [[Unstruttal|Unstrut valley]] in the near vicinity of the settlement. The second group, composed of most of the females, could grew up in households that predominantly cultivated plots on loess, possibly beyond the landmarks of the [[Unstrut|Unstrut River]] or about 80m above the site on the Querfurt plateau 1–2&amp;nbsp;km away. Sex-specific tendencies, the combination of the Sr isotope data with the results of previous carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses, and the similarity of the Sr isotope data of the youngest child with the majority of the males may be evaluated as being in agreement with the predominance of patrilocal residential rules.

The Karsdorf population diet consisted of plant crops consumption quite similar to other LBK sites but ate slightly higher quantities of animal protein. Despite of this, there is one female individual that could be classified as a vegan because her results show that she fell in the range of those of the domestic and wild fauna from Karsdorf, indicating she might have lived on the similar herbivore diet for unknown reasons. &lt;br&gt;The consumption of unfermented dairy products is unlikely as there is direct palaeogenetic evidence of lactose intolerance for the site Derenburg. Children in these LBK cultures may have been weaned around the age of three and apparently ate the similar diet as adults after weaning. The highest isotopic value for stable isotopes of nitrogen is found in the youngest Karsdorf individual likely due to breastfeeding effects. In the Karsdorf population the highest animal arotein consumption signal is found in a 15–18 years old individual belonging to mtDNA H. In addition, the lowest Plant Crop consumption signal is found in the youngest Karsdorf individual and secondarily in two out of three 21–24 years old individuals belonging to mtDNA U5a and H.&lt;ref name="Oelze10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oelze | first1 = Vicky M. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2010 | title = Early Neolithic diet and animal husbandry: stable isotope evidence from three Linearbandkeramik (LBK) sites in Central Germany | url = | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume =  38| issue = | pages = 270–279| doi=10.1016/j.jas.2010.08.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA analysis==
The two males, KAR6 and KAR 16a, identified as Haplogroup T1 from Karsdorf constitutes 22.2% of all ancient samples between 7500 and 6800 BP in Germany. The remainder belong to other clades: 22.2% are H2 carriers from [[Derenburg]], and the remaining 55.6% are G2a bearers from [[Halberstadt]] and Derenburg.

In 2015 a published study by Mathieson et al. test several individuals from two Neolithic sites in northwest Anatolia, the results showed that Haplogroup T1a-M70, previously found in LBK sites from Germany, was not present in Barcin nor Mentese Neolithic settlements. This fact together with the absence of the mtDNA lineages carried by both of the T1a individuals from Karsdorf and the occurrence of G2a and the mtDNA lineages carried by all of these G2a individuals, could mean that the Early European Neolithic T1a-M70 had a different migration pattern and, therefore, a different geographical origin.

The autosomal data of I0797 showed the lowest frequency of Anatolian Neolithic component and the highest frequency of an unknown ancient human population for any studied LBK individual. This reinforces the hypothesis of a possible different geographical origin for this T1a tribe instead of the Greco-Anatolian origin of other human groups found in the LBK like G2a.

By his side, I0795 showed higher autosomal admixture frequencies of surrounding populations like Hunter Gatherer Europeans I2a (West Hunter Gatherers) and Aegean-Anatolian Neolithics G2a and H2. However, I0795 have the highest frequency of shared DNA with Upper Paleolithic Neanderthals from Central Europe found in any Early Neolithic population. Further comparisons show that I0795 has similar frequencies like [[Peștera cu Oase#Oase 1|Oase-1]] when compared with [[Vindija Cave|Vindija Neanderthals]]. When I0795 and I0797 are compared to Oase-1, they both share a very high percentage of DNA 34% and 18% respectively and I0795 12% with Ostuni1. This could mean that this T1a1 tribe from Karsdorf was closest to Upper Paleolithic Hunter-Gatherers than to Mesolithic haplogroups.

The '''Kildalton Cross''' is a monolithic [[high cross]] in [[Celtic cross]] form in the churchyard of the former parish church of Kildalton (from [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''Cill Daltain'', "Church of the Foster Son" (i.e. [[St John the Evangelist]]) on the island of [[Islay]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]], [[Scotland]].  It was carved probably in the second half of the 8th century AD, and is closely related to crosses of similar date on [[Iona]].  It is often considered the finest surviving Celtic cross in Scotland, and is certainly one of the most perfect monuments of its date to survive on western [[Europe]].  The cross and the adjacent roofless [[medieval]] parish church are in the care of [[Historic Scotland]] (access at all times) and are jointly a [[scheduled ancient monument]] &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/SM13236|title=Kildalton Church, church, High Cross, and cross 60m NE ofSM13236|publisher= Historic Environment Scotland|accessdate=5 September 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;.  A simpler cross of late medieval date stands nearby.

==Ornament==
The Kildalton Cross features an iconic image of the Virgin and Child, which is closely related to similar Virgin and Child iconography found on St. Martin's Cross and St. Oran's Cross at [[Iona]]. In addition, this panel displays similarities with folio 7v in the [[Book of Kells]]. This type of [[iconography]] of the [[Virgin and Child]] may be related to contemporary Marian iconography in the Mediterranean, specifically the Maria Regina which was used in Rome to refute [[iconoclasm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Humphrey|first1=Hayley|title=Representations of the Virgin Mary on Irish High Crosses: Icons, Narratives and Symbols of Power|date=2012|publisher=National University of Ireland, Galway|location=Galway, Ireland|url=http://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10379/2943/2011HumphreyPhD.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist literature is fiction or nonfiction which supports the [[Feminism|feminist]] goals of defining, establishing and defending equal [[Civil and political rights|civil, political, economic]] and [[social rights]] for women. It often identifies women's roles as unequal to those of men{{spaced ndash}}particularly as regards status, privilege and power{{spaced ndash}}and generally portrays the consequences to women, men, families, communities and societies as undesirable.

The following is a '''list of American feminist literature''' listed by year of first publication, then within the year alphabetically by title. Books and magazines are in italics, all other types of literature are not and are in quotation marks. References lead when possible to a link to the full text of the literature.

The works of [[Maya Angelou]] encompass [[autobiography]], plays, [[poetry|poetic]], and television producer.  She also had an active directing, acting, and speaking career.  She is best known for her books, including her series of seven autobiographies, starting with the critically acclaimed ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' (1969).

Angelou's autobiographies are distinct in style and narration, and "stretch over time and place",&lt;ref name="lupton-1" /&gt; from Arkansas to Africa and back to the US.  They take place from the beginnings of World War&amp;nbsp;II to the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="lupton-1" /&gt;  Angelou wrote collections of essays, including ''[[Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now]]'' (1993) and ''[[Even the Stars Look Lonesome]] ''(1997), which writer [[Hilton Als]] called her "wisdom books" and "homilies strung together with autobiographical texts".&lt;ref name="songbird" /&gt;  Angelou used the same editor throughout her writing career, [[Robert Loomis]], an executive editor at [[Random House]], until he retired in 2011.&lt;ref name="italie" /&gt;  Angelou said regarding Loomis: "We have a relationship that's kind of famous among publishers."&lt;ref name="tate-155" /&gt;

She was one of the most honored writers of her generation, earning an extended list of [[List of honors and awards for Maya Angelou|honors and awards]], as well as more than 30 honorary degrees.&lt;ref name="smithsonian" /&gt;  She was a prolific writer of poetry; her volume ''[[Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie]]'' (1971) was nominated for the [[Pulitzer Prize]],&lt;ref name="gillespie-103" /&gt; and she was chosen by President [[Bill Clinton]] to recite her poem "[[On the Pulse of Morning]]" during his inauguration in 1993.&lt;ref name="wordsmith" /&gt;

Angelou's successful acting career included roles in numerous plays, films, and television programs, such as in the television mini-series ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' in 1977.  Her screenplay ''Georgia, Georgia'' (1972) was the first original script by a black woman to be produced.&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="briefbio" /&gt; and she was the first African-American woman to direct a major motion picture, ''Down in the Delta'', in 1998.&lt;ref name="gillespie-144" /&gt;  Since the 1990s, Angelou participated in the lecture circuit,&lt;ref name="wordsmith" /&gt; which she continued into her eighties.&lt;ref name="younge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gillespie-9" /&gt;

==Media industry profiles==

===Book publishing===
The book publishing industry in the United States is based in New York. Publishing houses in the city range from industry giants such as [[Penguin Group (USA)]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Random House]], [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], and [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]] to small niche houses like Melville House and [[Lee &amp; Low Books]]. New York has also been the setting for countless works of literature, many of them produced by the city's large population of writers (which have included [[Paul Auster]], [[Don DeLillo]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Jonathan Safran Foer]], [[Jonathan Franzen]], [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], [[Jonathan Lethem]], [[John O'Hara]], [[Dorothy Parker]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[Susan Sontag]] and many others). The New York City metro area, home to the largest number of Jews outside [[Israel]], has also been a flourishing scene for [[Jewish American literature]].

New York is also home to [[PEN American Center]], the largest of the 141 centers of International PEN, the world’s oldest human rights organization and the oldest international literary organization.

In the earliest days of the American film industry, New York was the epicenter of filmmaking. However, the drier weather of Hollywood and tax incentives offered at the time by filming in Los Angeles made California a better choice for film production throughout much of the 20th century. The [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] film studio, built during the [[silent film]] era, was used by the [[Marx Brothers]] and [[W.C. Fields]], and has expanded its footprint in [[Queens]]. It has also been used for ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and the films of [[Woody Allen]]. The recently constructed [[Steiner Studios]] is a 15-acre (61,000 m²) modern movie studio complex in a former shipyard where ''The Producers'' and ''The Inside Man'', a [[Spike Lee]] movie, were filmed.

New York was, and to a certain extent still is, also important within the animation industry. Until 1938, it served as the home of Fleischer Studios (who produced the [[Popeye]], [[Betty Boop]], and [[Color Classics]] shorts for [[Paramount Pictures]]) as well as the Van Beuren Studios (who produced animated shorts for [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]]) until 1937. It would later be the home for Famous Studios (who replaced Fleischer Studios and continued the production of Popeye shorts for Paramount) from 1943 to the 1960s. Its current position in the animation world is as an alternative to Los Angeles (where most U.S. animation is produced), and the city now houses several schools and school programs concerning animation, and stands as a source of work for animators working for any medium, from advertising to film.

[[Silvercup Studios]] has expanded in [[Long Island City, Queens]] with numerous soundstages, production and studio support space, offices for media and entertainment companies, stores, 1,000 apartments in [[high-rise]] towers, a catering hall and a cultural institution, built at the edge of the [[East River]] in Queens, overlooking [[Manhattan]], and maintaining its status as the largest production house on the [[East Coast of the United States| U.S. East Coast]]. Steiner Studios in [[Brooklyn]] still has the largest individual soundstage, however. [[Miramax Films]], a [[Big Ten (movie studios)|Big Ten]] film studio, was the largest motion picture distribution and production company headquartered in the city until it moved to [[Burbank, California]] in January 2010. Many smaller independent producers and distributors are located in New York.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of New York City}}

In the 1930s, New York-based [[RCA]] was the nation's largest manufacturer of [[phonograph]]s. In the late 19th and early 20th century, most sheet music in the United States — especially the popular songs of the day, many now standards — was printed at [[Tin Pan Alley]], so called because the constant sound of new songs being tried out on pianos in the publishing houses was said to sound like a tin pan. By the early 1960s the radio and musical stars of the Golden Age of [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] gave way to the [[Brill Building]]'s "Brill Sound".

[[Salsa music]], which got its start in New York City in the mid-1960s, was popularized by the New York record label [[Fania Records]], which developed a highly polished "Fania sound" that came to be synonymous with salsa.

In the 1980s and 1990s, [[hip hop music|hip hop]] labels including [[Def Jam]], [[Roc-A-Fella]] and [[Bad Boy Records]] were founded in New York, creating what is known as [[East Coast hip hop]]. These labels continue to be among the largest hip-hop labels in the world. Other influential New York-based hip hop labels, past and present, include [[Cold Chillin' Records]], [[Jive Records]], [[Loud Records]], [[Rawkus Records]] and [[Tommy Boy Records]].

Two of the [[music industry|"Big Four" music labels]] are headquartered in the city: [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and [[Warner Music Group]]. The world headquarters of [[MTV]] is also in New York.

[[File:NYC subway riders with their newspapers.jpg|thumb|left|Straphangers use newspapers on New York's [[Mass transit in New York City|mass transit]] system.]]
''[[El Diario La Prensa]]'' (circulation 265,000) is New York's largest Spanish-language daily and the oldest in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;"Editor &amp; Publisher International Year Book 2004". Found at infoplease.com.[http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0004420.html]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several borough-specific newspapers, such as ''[[Brooklyn Eagle|The Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]'' and ''[[The Staten Island Advance]]''. [[Free daily newspaper]]s mainly distributed to commuters include ''[[amNewYork]]'', ''[[Hoy (U.S. newspaper)|Hoy]]'' and ''[[Metro New York]]''.  In addition to the print newspapers, ''[[BKLYNER]]'' is the leading daily digital news publication reporting on local news and events in Brooklyn.

The city's ethnic press is large and diverse. Major ethnic publications include the Roman Catholic diocesan paper for Brooklyn-Queens, ''[[The Tablet (Diocese of Brooklyn)|The Tablet]]'' and [[Jewish-American]] newspapers ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' (פֿאָרװערטס; ''Forverts'', published in [[Yiddish]] and [[English language|English]]) (founded in 1897), and [[African-American newspapers]], including the long-time newspaper ''[[The New York Amsterdam News]]'' (founded in 1909) and [[Brooklyn]]-based [[Our Time Press]].

Ethnic variation is not the only measure of the diversity of New York City's newspapers, with editorial opinions running from left-leaning at alternative papers like the ''[[Village Voice]]'', to conservative at the ''[[New York Post]]''. ''[[New York Observer]]'' covers politics and the city's rich and powerful with unusual depth. The tradition of a [[freedom of the press|free press]] owes much to [[John Peter Zenger]], a New York publisher who was acquitted in his 1735 landmark court case, setting the precedent that truth was a legitimate defense against accusations of [[Slander and libel|libel]].

Major newspapers emphasizing coverage of the New York metropolitan region outside the city include ''[[Newsday]]'', which covers primarily Long Island but also New York City, (especially [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]]), ''[[The Journal News]]'', which covers Westchester County, to the north along the [[Hudson River]] and ''[[The Bergen Record]]'' and ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] which cover northern [[New Jersey]] across the [[New York Bay]] and Hudson River to the west.

Among the former are [[Tumblr]] (now owned by [[Yahoo!]]), [[FourSquare]] and [[AOL]]. Among the latter are [[Gawker Media]], [[BuzzFeed]], and some of AOL's holdings, including [[HuffPost]] and [[Weblogs, Inc.]] The satirical newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' (online-only since 2013) was based in New York from 2000 to 2012.

===Radio===
New York City has a tradition as an important place in radio broadcasting. [[Edward R. Murrow]] defined American broadcast journalism with his [[World War II]] reporting from Europe relayed back to [[CBS]] in New York and onward to the rest of the nation.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[WNYC]], New York's flagship [[public radio]] station, is the most-listened to commercial or non-commercial radio station in Manhattan and has the largest audience of any public radio station in the United States. It produces several news and cultural programs for national syndication.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[WBAI]] in Manhattan, with news and information programming, is one of the few [[socialist]] radio stations operating in the United States.

Fordham University's [[WFUV]], New York University's [[WNYU]] and Columbia University's [[WKCR]] are also important non-commercial stations in the city.

The first New York City radio station to feature a phone-in talk format was [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] in the late 1960s, (with [[Long John Nebel]] in the early morning hours) but the format began in earnest in New York in 1970, when [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] radio dropped its "Good Guys" top-40 radio format in favor of the "Dial-Log Radio" slate of call-in shows. In addition to mainstay [[Barry Gray (radio)|Barry Gray]], the format featured such prominent talkers as Nebel, [[Alex Bennett (broadcaster)|Alex Bennett]] and [[Bob Grant (radio host)|Bob Grant]].

Right-wing talk radio came to New York when [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] switched from an all music format to talk in 1982. Though it began with a moribund "Talkradio" format delivered via satellite from KABC Los Angeles, the station eventually became the home of nationally syndicated conservative powerhouse [[Rush Limbaugh]], who in the Reagan years railed against liberal figures like civil-rights advocate [[Jesse Jackson]] and former New York Governor [[Mario Cuomo]]. Other high-profile conservative talk radio hosts with national profiles include [[Laura Ingraham]] and [[Sean Hannity]] at WABC.

Liberals responded, first with the short-lived (only nine years) [[WEVD]] format with [[Bill Mazer]]'s ''Mazer in the morning'' and [[Sam Greenfield]] in the afternoon followed by [[Alan Colmes]] from 11 PM to 2AM. In March 2004 the [[Air America Radio]] network started, based in New York City, with actor-comedians [[Al Franken]] and [[Janeane Garofalo]] as their front line stars. A personality who goes by one name, "Lionel", who was a host on WABC also joined the Air America's New York local lineup. Air American's flagship station was originally [[WLIB]], then [[WWRL]] at the time of its January 2010 demise. WWRL and listener supported [[WBAI]] continue broadcasting progressive talk.

New York is also home to several famous "[[shock jock]]" morning drive shows. They include the new current flavor [[Opie and Anthony]] as well as old timer [[Don Imus]], (famous for his controversial statements, interviews of politicos and morning satire) and [[Elvis Duran and the Morning Show]] on [[WHTZ|Z100]]. The nation's first female shock jock, [[Wendy Williams (radio host)|Wendy Williams]], had a popular syndicated afternoon show on Urban AC [[WBLS]] from 2002-2009. [[WNYL (FM)|WXRK]], formerly known as 92.3 "K-Rock", used to be the home of [[Howard Stern]] until his move from terrestrial radio to [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], though Stern still broadcasts from New York City.

[[WQHT (FM)|WQHT]], also known as "Hot 97", is an influential high-profile commercial radio station that is arguably the nation's premier [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] station.

===Television===
New York City is the home of the three traditional major American [[television network]]s, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[NBC]], as well as Spanish-language network [[Univision]]. They each have local broadcast owned and operated stations which serve as the flagship stations of their networks.

It is also the headquarters of several large cable television channels, including [[MTV]], [[Fox News]], [[HBO]], and [[Comedy Central]]. [[Silvercup Studios]], located in [[Queens]] was the production facility for the popular television shows ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]''. MTV broadcasts programming from its sound stage overlooking [[Times Square]], several blocks away from The [[Ed Sullivan Theater]], the theater housing the ''[[Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''. ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' is broadcast from NBC's studios at 30 [[Rockefeller Center]], where ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'', ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]'', ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' and ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' is also taped. [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] is headquartered on 57th Street. ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' is produced by [[Comedy Central]] on [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]], and ''[[The Daily Show]]'', also produced by Comedy Central, is produced just a few blocks over on 11th avenue and West 53rd street. Glenn Beck's The Blaze TV has a studio in Manhattan. Over a thousand people are involved with producing the various ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' television series. In 2005 there were more than 100 new and returning television shows taped in New York City, according to the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting.

[[WNET]], New York's largest public television station, is a primary national provider of [[PBS]] programming. The oldest [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] in the United States is the [[Manhattan Neighborhood Network]], well known for its eclectic [[Public-access television|local origination]] programming that ranges from a jazz hour to discussion of labor issues to foreign language and religious programming. There are eight other Public-access television channels in New York, including Brooklyn Community Access Television (BCAT). As part of use of local rights-of-way, the cable operators in New York have granted [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) organizations channels for programming. They also carry the [[New York State]] legislative channel available on cable packages with sufficient bandwidth.

Another notable channel in the city is [[NY1]], established in 1992 as [[Time Warner Cable]]'s first local news channel and acquired with the rest of Time Warner Cable by [[Charter Communications]] in May 2016. NY1 is known for its beat coverage of city neighborhoods, and its coverage of [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] and state politics is closely watched by political insiders.

For years, several soap operas were filmed in the New York City area, including ''Another World'', ''As the World Turns'', ''Guiding Light'', ''All My Children'' and ''One Life to Live''. As of 2012, there are no New York soap operas left on the air.

==Portrayals of New York City in the media==
Because of its sheer size and cultural influence, New York City has been the subject of many different, and often contradictory, portrayals in mass media. From the sophisticated and worldly metropolis seen in many [[Woody Allen]] films, to the hellish and chaotic urban jungle depicted in such movies as [[Martin Scorsese|Martin Scorsese's]] ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), New York has served as the unwitting backdrop for virtually every conceivable viewpoint on big city life.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In the early years of film New York City was characterized as urbane and sophisticated. By the city's crisis period in the 1970s, however, films like ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (1969), ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), and ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]'' (1974) showed New York as full of chaos and violence. With the city's renaissance in the 1990s came new portrayals on television; ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', and ''[[Sex and the City]]'' showed life in the city to be glamorous and interesting. Nonetheless a disproportionate number of crime dramas, such as ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' and the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' film series, continue to use the city as their setting despite New York's status as the safest large city in the United States after plummeting crime rates over many years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.safewise.com/blog/safest-metro-cities/&lt;/ref&gt;

An essay appearing in the Arts section of ''The New York Times'' in April 2006 quoted several filmmakers, including [[Sidney Lumet]] and [[Paul Mazursky]], describing how modern cinema shows the city as far more "teeming, terrifying, exhilarating, unforgiving" than contemporary New York actually is, and the consequential challenge this poses for filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/movies/30clar.html "New York City as Film Set: From Mean Streets to Clean Streets"]. ''The New York Times'' April 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The article quotes Robert Greenhut, [[Woody Allen|Woody Allen's]] producer, as saying that despite the increased sanitization of modern New York, "New Yorkers' personalities are different to Chicago. There's a certain kind of vibrancy and tone that you can't get elsewhere. The labor pool is more interesting than elsewhere — the salesgirl with one line, or the cop. That's who directors are looking for."

== History ==

MCBA was established in 1983. Two years later, it moved to the first floor of the McKesson building, at 24 North Third Street, in the [[North Loop, Minneapolis|Warehouse District]] of Minneapolis. In this space, MCBA established educational, artistic, and community programs to introduce book arts to the public and promote appreciation of artists' books, fine-press publications, broadsides and other artworks created using book art techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Amy. "Made by Hand". ''Format'', January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, MCBA joined [[The Loft Literary Center]] and [[Milkweed Editions]] in establishing [[Open Book Minneapolis|Open Book]], a center for literary and visual arts, in downtown Minneapolis. The building creates a lively destination for a diverse public interested in books, book arts and literary endeavors of all kinds.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Mary Ann. "Where Literature Lives: The New Open Book Building". ''St. Paul Pioneer Press'', May 7, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, MCBA served as a partner in the [[Walker Art Center]]'s "Walker Without Walls" as a satellite location for ''No Reading Required'', an exhibition of artists' books from the Walker's library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.walkerart.org/release.wac?id=1493 "No Reading Required: Artists' Books from the Walker Art Center Library Collection on View at Minnesota Center for Book Arts"].

'''''Minotaure''''', published between 1933 and 1939, was a [[Surrealism|Surrealist]]-oriented magazine founded by [[Albert Skira]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=G&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.guggenheim.org/findings/minotaure-surrealist-magazine-1930s/|website=guggenheim.org|date=September 25, 2014|title=Minotaure: Surrealist Magazine from the 1930s|first=Jillian|last=Suarez}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paris: The Heart of Surrealism 1924|url=http://www.mattesonart.com/paris-the-heart-of-surrealism-1924.aspx|website=mattesonart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
The editors were [[André Breton]] and [[Pierre Mabille]].&lt;ref name=G/&gt; It was a luxurious publication, sporting original artworks on its cover by prestigious artists like [[Pablo Picasso]]. The magazine was sponsored and advised by Surrealist art patron [[Edward James]], and is still one of the richest sources of information about the pre-war Surrealist world. In many ways, it was the successor to ''[[Le Surrealisme au service de la revolution]]'', the group journal that ceased publication in 1933.

''Minotaure'' brought to the attention of the [[art world]] many little-known figures such as [[Hans Bellmer]], [[Victor Brauner]], [[Paul Delvaux]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], and [[Roberto Matta]]. It is also the only surrealist publication to feature articles on [[architecture]]: [[Tristan Tzara]] ("D'un certain automatisme du goût", no. 3–4), [[Salvador Dalí]] ("De la beauté terrifiante et comestible, de l'architecture Modern' style", no. 3–4) and Roberto Matta ("Mathématiques sensibles - Architecture du Temps", no. 11). It also contained the first published essays of the famed French psychiatrist and philosopher, Jacques Lacan (Vol. 1 and 4).

[[File:Moscow 05-2017 img41 Conservatory.jpg|thumb|The Great Hall, the main performance auditorium]]
The '''Moscow Conservatory''', also officially '''Moscow State Tchaikovsky Conservatory ''' ({{lang-ru|Московская государственная консерватория им. П. И. Чайковского|link=no}}) is an educational music institution located in [[Moscow]], Russia. It grants undergraduate and graduate diplomas in musical performance and musical research. The conservatory offers various degrees including Bachelor of Music Performance, Master of Music and PhD in research. 

==History==
It was co-founded in 1866 as the '''Moscow Imperial Conservatory''' by [[Nikolai Rubinstein]] and Prince [[Nikolai Petrovitch Troubetzkoy|Nikolai Troubetzkoy]]. It is the second oldest conservatory in Russia] after the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]]. [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] was appointed professor of theory and harmony at its opening. Since 1940 the conservatory bears his name.

==Choral faculty==
Prior to the [[October Revolution]] the choral faculty of the conservatory was second to the [[Moscow Synodal School]] and [[Moscow Synodal Choir]], but in 1919 both were closed and merged into the choral faculty. Some of the students now listed as being of the conservatory were in fact students of the Synodal School.

==Great Hall==
The renovation of the hall was completed in 2011.

'''Moysés Baumstein''' (June 13, 1931 in [[São Paulo]] &amp;ndash; December 4, 1991 in São Paulo) was a [[Brazil]]ian artist.

Moysés worked in many fields: from literary creation to [[painting]], from [[film making]] to [[holography]].
He was driven by singular curiosity and diligence and typified as a "[[Polymath|Renaissance Man]]" joining science with art throughout his accomplishments.

Baumstein began his artistic career as a painter influenced by the [[Spain|Spanish]] painter [[Joan Ponç]], with whom he founded the group “L´Espai” in [[São Paulo]] in 1960. He later became interested in [[photography]], cinema and theatre and at the beginning of the seventies began to write experimental fiction and produce animation cinema in [[Super 8 mm film|Super8]] and [[16mm]].
In 1981 founded Videcom, a video production house in São Paulo directed for corporate and cultural productions.

It was not until 1982 that he began to work in [[holography]], using [[artisan]]al methods. He completed and perfected his technique in 1983 after a holography workshop with the German artist [[Dieter Jung (artist)]]. In the same year he had his first holographic exhibition at the [[São Paulo Museum of Image and Sound|Museu da Imagem e do Som]] in São Paulo. In 1984 he developed a specific holographic technique for chromatic control and began the regular production of technically very elaborate works.
At that time in his holographic studio he began the production of commercial holograms as well as artistic works.

In some of his projects in this field he worked in collaboration with other Brazilian artists and poets interested in holography ([[Augusto de Campos]], Décio Pignatari, Julio Plaza and José Wagner Garcia). The results of such collaboration were shown at the “Triluz” exhibition (1986) in the Museu da Imagem e do Som, and at the “Idehologia” exhibition (1987) in the Museu de Arte Contemporânea, São Paulo, amongst others.
With José Wagner Garcia he created the prototype of a holographic cinema projector a "Holographic Kinetoscope".

A year after his death a retrospective of his cinema and video works was held at the 9th International “[[Videobrasil]]” Festival - 1992 in São Paulo.

Holographic poems by Augusto de Campos and produced by Baumstein were purchased by the "Centre Régional des Lettres de Basse-Normandie" in [[France]] and in 2007, the holographic poem REVER was exhibited at the exhibition "Concrete Poetry - O Projeto Verbivocovisual" in Tomie Ohtake Institute (São Paulo) and at the Palácio das Artes (Belo Horizonte).

Videcom kept the activities of his holographic laboratory until 2007 when all the equipment was donated to the Optical Lab from the University of Campinas Physics Institute under the responsibility of Jose Lunazzi.

Between September and November 2010 his holograms were presented at the exhibition "TEKHNE" ([http://www.faap.br/hotsites/memorias_reveladas_tekhne/home.asp Tekhne page in English/Portuguese and Spanish]) at Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado (FAAP) in São Paulo, which introduced the discussion of the importance of the convergence between art and technology.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Mr. Big (''Sex and the City'')}}
'''John James "Mr. Big" Preston''' is a [[recurring character]] in the [[HBO]] series ''[[Sex and the City]]'', portrayed by [[Chris Noth]]. He is the primary on-and-off love interest of the series' protagonist, [[Carrie Bradshaw]], who usually simply refers to him as "Big".

According to accounts in the press, the Mr. Big character was based on publishing executive [[Ron Galotti]], former publisher of ''[[GQ]]'' and ''[[Talk (magazine)|Talk]]''. Bushnell told ''[[New York Magazine]]'' in 2004, "He was one of those New York guys with a big personality—you just notice him as soon as he walks in the room," and "I called him Mr. Big because he was like a big man on campus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/n_10334/|title=Goodbye, Mr. Big|website=NYMag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big appeared in [[Comcast]]'s list of TV's Most Intriguing Characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV's Most Intriguing Characters|url=http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/tv-intriguingcharacters/16/|publisher=[[Comcast]]|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Big" appears in the first episode of ''[[Sex and the City (SATC pilot)|Sex and the City]]'' as a very attractive stranger who helps Carrie pick up the contents of her purse (notably cosmetics and condoms) after she is accidentally bumped by a stranger on the streets of [[Manhattan]]. The nickname "Big" refers to his status as a "major tycoon, major dreamboat, and majorly out of [Carrie's] league," according to the show's dialogue. (His real name is not revealed to viewers until the final episode of the series; in a running joke, whenever Carrie is about to introduce Mr. Big to another character onscreen, she is interrupted before she can say his name.) When Carrie and her friend [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha]] bump into Big at a nightclub, Samantha tries to hit on him, but he tactfully declines. In the first few episodes, he and Carrie frequently bump into one another, until finally Big suggests the two of them should "bump into one another on purpose". Carrie agrees and thus begins their on-again-off-again relationship.  Big calls Carrie by the nickname "Kid". When Carrie asks Big if he has ever been in love, he replies, "Ab-so-fucking-lutely".

==Story arc==
Carrie eventually falls in love with Big, despite his [[fear of commitment]]. His reserved communication on relationship issues and Carrie's coping with the ambiguity are frequent [[plot device]]s.  Carrie repeatedly returns to the relationship even though he is clearly emotionally unavailable to her and unable to meet her needs. Although it appears Mr. Big was emotionally crippled by a series of failed relationships, the subject is often glossed over as him simply being selfish. Mr. Big's tendency to take major emotional steps in the relationship more slowly than Carrie is often portrayed as emotional unavailability rather than the caution born of a repeatedly broken heart. Carrie's misinterpretation of Mr. Big's inner turmoil as unreachable distance often creates larger issues because of her misplaced feelings of unworthiness, and due to her propensity for not communicating truthfully until too late, results in a lot of painful misunderstandings. Carrie accepts no responsibility for her impatience and lack of empathy, often issuing ultimatums (i.e. first break-up), and Big can't shed his ingrained emotional pessimism to fully embrace Carrie as a partner. They break up repeatedly, over the course of two years for those reasons, before Big marries a gorgeous twenty-six-year-old socialite and [[Ralph Lauren]] employee named Natasha ([[Bridget Moynahan]]) after dating her for only five months. This hurts Carrie, as she wonders why he could take steps with Natasha that he refused to take with Carrie. It becomes obvious later that Mr. Big had simply skipped many of the important emotional steps before marriage, many of which he had definitely, if slowly, taken with Carrie, creating the problems of distance and unavailability between Big and Natasha, which Carrie had so feared in their own relationship.  

Within seven months of his marriage, he begins to chafe at his matrimonial bonds and pines for Carrie; he initiates an affair with her. Carrie, who is in a committed relationship (with [[Sex_and_the_City_characters#Aidan_Shaw|Aidan Shaw]]) at the time, feels guilty but continues to see Big.  The affair continues until Natasha comes home unexpectedly and discovers Carrie fleeing—half dressed—from the marital apartment. Natasha trips and breaks her tooth while chasing after Carrie, who ends up taking Natasha to the [[emergency room]]. As a result, Carrie ends the affair. Carrie later finds out that Big and Natasha have [[divorce]]d.

Big and Carrie eventually become close friends. He relocates to [[Napa Valley]], and they are able to discuss their other ongoing relationships with each other. But their sexual chemistry always remains just below the surface, and their friendship never remains strictly [[platonic love|platonic]]. After reading Carrie's book, Big begins to understand how much he has hurt her, and he empathizes further when a woman he is dating treats him in a fashion similar to the way Big has treated Carrie: at arm's length, eschewing true intimacy. The relationship between Big and the celebrity is certainly a parallel between Carrie/Big, except that the celebrity refuses physical intimacy one-sidedly, ignoring Big's overtures except when it suits her, whereas Carrie/Big's problems were almost completely emotional and undeniably two sided. Although it ends up allowing Big to finally get past his inner pain, the comparison is rather crude. Big grows as an emotional being, changing and evolving as the series progresses, moving past innate pain to suit Carrie's needs better, ostensibly becoming a "better man."

Big seems to have no real friends, at least in New York. He is rarely shown with other males, and when he is, they are usually credited as colleagues or acquaintances. At one scene he is shown to spend New Year's Eve celebration alone, sitting at a restaurant, but seems to feel comfortable with the situation.

===Series finale===

The series finale, "An American Girl in Paris", ties together the loose ends of Carrie and Big's relationship and concludes their long, unconventional courtship. Absent for most of season six, Big suddenly reappears in Carrie's life near the end of the season, once again at the wrong time. At this point, Carrie has grown tired and frustrated with Big's inconsistency and rebuffs him, but also realizes her behavior towards him has often pushed him away. However, Big is desperate to win Carrie back. The season finale depicts his attempt to reunite with her.

The series finale takes place over two episodes in which Carrie moves to Paris with her current boyfriend, Russian artist Aleksandr Petrovsky (played by [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]). In the first half of the finale, "An American Girl in Paris Part Une", Big shows up outside Carrie's apartment in New York after she fails to return his phone calls. She is on her way to her last dinner with the girls before departing for Paris. Big attempts to invite Carrie to dinner and drinks in order to apologize for the way he treated her, only to be turned down. Carrie explains that she is moving to Paris with a man she's in a relationship with. Big asks Carrie when she was going to tell him that she was moving to Paris, a reference to the time earlier in their relationship when Big moved to Napa and almost didn't tell Carrie. Big teases her about moving to Paris with a Russian and then tries to tell her that she's "The One". Carrie loses her temper and tells Big that she is tired of having him interrupt her life and ruin her happiness for the past six years. Then she rushes off to meet her friends for dinner, leaving Big alone and confused on the street.

When Charlotte stops by Carrie's apartment one day, she hears Big leaving a message on Carrie's answering machine, asking her for one last chance. Charlotte picks up and invites him to meet with her, Miranda, and Samantha. At a restaurant, he asks them if they think Carrie really is happy and if he has any shot of winning her back. After much deliberation, with Carrie's current situation and her history with Big in the forefront of their minds, Miranda tells him to "go get our girl". Mr. Big then does not appear again until the second installment of the finale, "An American Girl in Paris Part Deux".

Meanwhile, Carrie is distraught and unhappy in her relationship with Aleksandr. She passes Big in his limo on the street in Paris while looking for a cab, but neither of them see each other. Big appears to be searching for Carrie, but the limo rides on and Carrie continues on her way.

Big reappears in Carrie's hotel lobby at just the right moment, as Carrie is squatting down, tearfully gathering up stray diamonds from her broken necklace. She is waiting for a new hotel room, as she just walked out on Aleksandr after a big fight. Big comes through the door and as Carrie looks up and sees him, she begins to cry. She explains that everything is a mess and Paris isn't what she thought it would be. Then she tells Big that Alexandr slapped her during an argument. Big becomes protective and immediately begins climbing the stairs to Aleksandr's room to reprimand him (or as he puts it, "kick some Russian ass"). In a desperate attempt to stop him, Carrie trips him and they both fall to the floor, laughing hysterically. They give up seeking out Petrovsky and take a romantic stroll in Paris. He finally tells her she's the one and she asks him to take her home to New York. They arrive at Carrie's apartment late at night and she asks him if he wants to come up. He answers with a memorable line he used in the first episode ("abso-fucking-lutely"), which reminds the audience that he is still, in fact, the confident, sexy Big that Carrie has been in love with from day one.

His real name, John, is finally revealed on Carrie's cell phone [[caller ID]] after she returns to the city and he calls to tell her he is closing the sale of his Napa estate and returning to New York. Executive producer Michael Patrick King has stated that by never revealing his real name, Big remained "always slightly out of reach" for Carrie, and this plot device is maintained throughout the entire run of the series. Although we see his name in that final shot, Michael Patrick King makes a point (in the DVD commentary) that we never hear it spoken in the series.

==Feature films==
===Sex and the City: The Movie===
Four years later, Carrie and Big decide to marry, after Carrie brings it up when she starts to feel anxious about her relationship's status. She has just returned from an auction of jewelry from the collection of a woman (who was the long-time girlfriend of a wealthy man) who was abruptly dumped and thrown out of the apartment she'd shared with him for many years. The cautionary tale worries Carrie, so Big proposes in order for Carrie to have legal rights to the fabulous penthouse they are purchasing together. However, their plans for a simple wedding balloon out of control after ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' decides to feature her in a wedding gown in the magazine. The twice-divorced Big feels it has degenerated into a "circus", with hundreds of guests, unwanted publicity, and a tremendous designer wedding gown taking over the original plan for a small, private ceremony. An ill-thought comment from the just-separated and upset Miranda rattles him further. Just before the ceremony Big gives in to cold feet and bails, but rethinks the decision minutes later and rushes back. He intercepts Carrie as she is leaving the ceremony. A broken-hearted and humiliated Carrie attacks him with her bouquet, shrieking "I knew you would do this!" He repeatedly attempts to apologize and explain then and after, but Carrie ignores his letters and emails, and they spend months apart (close to a year) with no contact whatsoever. 

When Carrie hires an assistant, Louise, she instructs her to "put Big in a place where she never has to hear from him again." So Louise creates a folder in Carrie's e-mail that is password protected and Big's many e-mails are saved in the secret folder. Charlotte later gives birth to a baby&amp;mdash;her water breaking while she is yelling at Big for breaking Carrie's heart. Big takes her to the hospital and stays until the baby is born, hoping to run into Carrie. When Carrie arrives at the hospital, they tell her the tale. Harry reveals that Big begged her to call him, and that he's written her many letters. Puzzled, Carrie goes home and scours her mail, realizing that his e-mails are in Louise's secret folder. She guesses the password and finds that Big has re-written numerous love letters by poets, and one from himself promising to love her forever. Carrie's assistant reminds her that she left a pair of never-worn [[Manolo Blahnik]] shoes in the penthouse that she and Big owned, and that the locks will be changed for the new owners that day. Carrie rushes over to the penthouse to find Big there, holding her shoes. She runs into his arms as she can no longer deny her still very strong love for him. Carrie narrates, "It wasn't logic; it was love," and the two quietly marry at New York City Hall.

=== Sex and the City 2 ===
Carrie always wants to go out, while Mr. Big would prefer to stay home and watch television some evenings.  After Carrie returns to her old apartment to work on an assignment and their reunion is particularly sweet, Big proposes to be separated for two days in the week, with one of them staying in Carrie's old apartment, which she has always kept.  Carrie agrees, despite misgivings and questioning by Charlotte.
 
In Abu Dhabi, Carrie runs into her former love [[Sex and the City characters#Aidan Shaw|Aidan]]. Carrie and Aidan dated twice. They broke up the first time because Carrie and Big had an affair. They broke up a second time because Aidan still couldn't trust her after all that time due to her affair with Big, and after Aidan proposes, marriage doesn't sit well with Carrie, so the two break off their engagement. Aidan is now married with three boys and is in Abu Dhabi on business.  The two agree to meet for dinner, despite warnings from Charlotte, who feels that Carrie is "playing with fire".  Aidan and Carrie kiss before Carrie breaks away and runs to her hotel.  Distraught about what to do, she eventually calls Big to confess to the kiss.  He becomes distant and won't return her phone calls.

When Carrie returns to New York, the apartment is empty and she sits all day waiting for Big to come home.  He finally returns that evening with her "punishment": Carrie must wear a black diamond ring to remind herself that she is married.  The two reconcile and kiss.  The film concludes with a montage of scenes from the girls' lives - Big and Carrie have successfully combined their desires and interests, and the two are content as their married life has grown past the "Terrible Twos".

The '''National Music Publishers' Association''' (NMPA) is a [[trade association]] for the American [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing industry]]. Founded in 1917, the NMPA aims to "protect its members' [[intellectual property|property]] [[copyright|rights]] on the legislative, litigation, and regulatory fronts."&lt;ref name="nmpa"&gt;{{cite web|title=NMPA Mission Statement|url=http://nmpa.org/aboutnmpa/mission.asp|publisher=National Music Publishers Association|accessdate=December 12, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030222832/http://www.nmpa.org/aboutnmpa/mission.asp|archivedate=October 30, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NMPA has pursued litigation against numerous organizations, including [[Amway]],&lt;ref name="Amway"&gt;[http://www.culteducation.com/reference/amway/amway4.html Amway: The Untold Story: NMPA] (Press release), 25 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[YouTube]], [[Kazaa]], [[LimeWire]], [[Fullscreen (company)|FullScreen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Music Publishers Association Files Copyright Infringement Suit Against Fullscreen|url = http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/5638264/national-music-publishers-association-files-copyright|website = Billboard|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Napster]].

==History==

=== First half of the 20th century ===
The NMPA was founded in 1917 as the Music Publishers' Protective Association, seeking to end the practice of publishers having to pay [[vaudeville]] theaters for performing their music.  The [[payola]] was said to have reached $400,000.&lt;ref name="Billboard 1958 Apr 21" /&gt;  The MPPA mandate went into effect May 7, 1917.&lt;ref name="Variety 1917 May 4" /&gt;  Founding firms included:
* Broadway Music Corporation

* [[Harry Von Tilzer|Church, Paxson &amp; Co.]]
* [[Harry Von Tilzer|Karczag Publishing Company (Wilhelm Karczag; 1859–1923)]]
* [[Harry Von Tilzer|William Jerome]]

In 1927, the NMPA founded the [[Harry Fox Agency]], a [[mechanical license|mechanical rights]] collecting society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About HFA|url=http://www.harryfox.com/public/AboutHFA.jsp|publisher=Harry Fox Agency|accessdate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second half of the 20th century ===
In 1966 the name of the Music Publishers' Protective Association was changed to the National Music Publishers Association.  The NMPA lobbies federal legislators and regulators on behalf of music publishers and crafted guidelines for the [[Copyright Act of 1976]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frankel|first=James|title=The Teacher's Guide to Music, Media, and Copyright Law|year=2009|publisher=Hal Leonard|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4234-4344-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MH0OILv1B18C&amp;pg=PA82|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===
In September 2001, the NMPA reached a settlement with [[Napster]], turning the company into a fee-based service with publishers licensing music to the users.&lt;ref name="Early History of Napster"&gt;[http://www.moyak.com/papers/napster-history.html "Early History of Napster"], by Moya K. Mason, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The NMPA won a judgment against [[peer-to-peer]] filing service [[StreamCast Networks]] in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=K. C.|title=Music Publishers Sue YouTube|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/201300611|accessdate=December 12, 2011|newspaper=InformationWeek|date=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, NMPA joined a lawsuit against [[YouTube]] for hosting user-generated videos containing music under copyright. The suit was dropped four years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Music Publishers to Join YouTube Suit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/technology/07youtube.html|accessdate=December 12, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 7, 2007|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lang|first=Brent|title=Music Publishers Drop Copyright Suit Against YouTube|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/17/idUS115394738920110817|accessdate=December 12, 2011|newspaper=TheWrap|date=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[Music Publishers' Association]] (MPA), the NMPA has been responsible for taking many free guitar [[tablature]] web sites offline. NMPA President David Israelite asserted that "[u]nauthorised use of lyrics and tablature deprives the songwriter of the ability to make a living, and is no different than stealing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Youngs|first=Ian|title=Song sites face legal crackdown|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4508158.stm|accessdate=December 12, 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=December 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NMPA also pushed for rate hikes for legal downloads of music in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Albanesius|first=Chloe|title=Music-Download Royalty Rates Left Unchanged|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2331598,00.asp|accessdate=December 12, 2011|newspaper=PC Magazine|date=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the NMPA represented [[EMI]], [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing|Sony/ATV]], [[Universal Music Publishing Group|Universal]] and [[Warner/Chappell Music|Warner/Chappell]], Bug, [[MPL Communications]], [[Peermusic]] and the Richmond Organization in a lawsuit against [[LimeWire]]. The suit sought $150,000 for each song that was distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mick|first=Jason|title=New Suit Against Limewire Could Total 15 Times Music Industry's Yearly Income|url=http://www.dailytech.com/New+Suit+Against+Limewire+Could+Total+15+Times+Music+Industrys+Yearly+Income/article18769.htm|accessdate=December 12, 2011|newspaper=Daily Tech|date=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NMPA is a member of the [[International Intellectual Property Alliance]], a business alliance which amongst others publishes the [[Special 301 Report]], a controversial list of countries that the coalition of [[copyright]] holders feel do not do enough to combat [[copyright infringement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Masnick|first=Mike|title=IIPA's Section 301 Filing Shows It's Really Not At All Interested In Reducing Copyright Infringement|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100224/0229248284.shtml|accessdate=December 12, 2011|newspaper=Tech Dirt|date=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the NMPA sold the Harry Fox Agency to [[SESAC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SESAC Finalizes Acquisition of Harry Fox Agency|url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6693385/sesac-finalizes-acquisition-of-harry-fox-agency|website = Billboard|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the NMPA announced that it had reached an agreement to with YouTube to allow the distribution of royalties for musical works used in videos on YouTube where ownership was previously unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Cooke, [http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/nmpa-announces-deal-with-youtube-over-unpaid-song-royalties/ "NMPA announces deal with YouTube over unpaid song royalties,"] ''Completemusicupdate.com'', December 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry Janvier.jpg|thumb|Calendar miniature for January from the ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'']]
A '''nef''' is an extravagant table ornament and container used in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], made of [[precious metal]]s in the shape of a ship – ''nef'' was another word for a [[carrack]] in French.  If not just used for decoration, it could hold [[salt]] or [[spice]]s (the latter being very expensive in the Middle Ages), or [[cutlery]], or even [[napkin]]s. The large nef depicted in the well-known calendar miniature for January from the ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'' is being used to hold, and perhaps wash, gilt dishes from the table service.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 2006, p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; Nefs are recorded in France as early as 1239,&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown 1978, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; initially consisting of just the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], and perhaps initially used to drink from; by the 14th century the most elaborate had masts, sails and even crew, and had become too crowded with such details to be used as containers for anything. The so-called [[Mechanical Galleon]] in the [[British Museum]] is a late 16th-century German nef which was also a clock and [[automaton]], with moving figures and music.

A nef was usually made of [[silver]], [[silver-gilt]] or [[gold]], often further embellished with [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[Gemstone|jewel]]s.  A [[nautilus shell]] often formed the hull of the ship, as in the [[Burghley Nef]] (illustrated). Some nefs had wheels to allow them to be rolled from one end of the table to the other, but most had legs or pedestals.  The nef was placed in front of the most important person at table as a mark of their status.

The equivalent in religious plate is a ''navicula'', Latin for small ship, and also a term in English for a boat-shaped [[incense]]-holder.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Navicula. 3"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4248">{{Intellectual property}}
'''Paracopyright''' ("pseudocopyright" or "metacopyright") is legal protection above and beyond traditional [[copyright]]. The most often cited example is "legal protection for technical measures" from the 1996 [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]] Internet treaties. Paracopyright provisions in these treaties are not about the term or scope of copyright, but instead are about providing legal protections for the technologies that may be used by copyright holders. 

Paracopyrights afford legal protection to technologies that claim to be used to protect copyrights, but that are ineffective in that goal. A technical measure can not stop a technically sophisticated person who wishes to infringe copyright.  To use the "digital locks" analogy, there is no need to "pick the lock" as the keys necessary to decode the content are embedded within authorized access technology.  Both the locked content and the technology containing the key are commercially available to an infringer.  Once a single person decodes a technical measure, the decoded content can be made available to others in the same way as if the technical measure never existed.

The effect of these technical measures are to impose specific contractual [[license agreement]]s on those conforming to copyright law. As a concept, therefore, paracopyrights are perhaps better understood as a part of [[contract law]] and not copyright law. Unfortunately, important regulations regarding consumer protection and the "freedom to contract" are not imported directly into paracopyright laws, potentially creating imbalances in the law and harmful [[unintended consequence]]s.

Copyright is traditionally understood as a statutorily defined [[Bundle of rights|bundle of exclusive rights]] provided to copyright holders. An [[Copyright infringement|infringement of copyright]] takes place when someone exercises one or more of the copyright holder’s exclusive rights without his or her permission. Anti-circumvention and anti-device provisions do not fit under this paradigm of a bundle of exclusive rights. On one hand, a copyright owner has the exclusive right to copy his or her work, and that exclusive right is infringed when someone else copies the work without permission. It is quite another story, however, to think about copyright holders having the exclusive right to circumvent TPMs ([[Technical Protection Measure]]) that they apply to their works, and the exclusive right to make and distribute devices that enable or facilitate circumvention of TPMs.  Even assuming that this problem could be overcome, attempting to force anti-circumvention and anti-device provisions to fit the mold of the [[bundle of rights]] paradigm seems to necessitate adding a number of related rights to the bundle, including the exclusive right to apply a TPM to a copyright work.

'''Perfume''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|p|ɜːr|f|j|uː|m}}, {{IPAc-en|US|p|ər|ˈ|f|j|uː|m}}; {{lang-fr|parfum}}) is a mixture of fragrant [[essential oil]]s or [[aroma compound]]s, [[Fixative (perfumery)|fixative]]s and [[solvent]]s, used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and living-spaces an agreeable [[scent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perfume|title= Perfume – Definition and More from Dictionary|work= merriam-webster.com}}wtf
&lt;/ref&gt;
It is usually in liquid form and used to give a pleasant scent to a person's body.
Ancient texts and archaeological excavations show the use of perfumes in some of the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as [[vanillin]] or [[coumarin]], which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics alone.

==History==
{{main|History of perfume}}

[[File:Egypte louvre 021.jpg|thumbnail|left|Egyptian scene depicting the preparation of lily perfume, 4th century BC]]

The word ''perfume'' derives from the Latin ''perfumare'', meaning "to smoke through". Perfumery, as the art of making perfumes, began in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and was further refined by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] and the Arabs.

The world's first-recorded [[chemist]] is considered a woman named [[Tapputi]], a perfume maker mentioned in a [[cuneiform]] tablet from the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Strathern, Paul |title= Mendeleyev's Dream – The Quest For the Elements|location= New York | publisher= Berkley Books|year= 2000|isbn= 0-425-18467-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She distilled flowers, oil, and [[Acorus calamus|calamus]] with other [[aromatic]]s, then filtered and put them back in the still several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Levey|first=Martin|title= Early Arabic Pharmacology: An Introduction Based on Ancient and Medieval Sources|publisher= Brill Archive|year=1973|page= 9|isbn= 90-04-03796-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, perfume and perfumery existed in the [[Indus civilization]] (3300 BC – 1300 BC). One of the earliest distillations of [[Ittar]] was mentioned in the Hindu Ayurvedic text ''[[Charaka Samhita]]'' and ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Agriculture Diversification: Problems and Perspectives|author1= A.K.

In the 9th century the [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arab chemist]] [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus) wrote the ''Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations'', which contained more than a hundred recipes for fragrant [[oils]], salves, aromatic waters, and substitutes or imitations of costly drugs. The book also described 107 methods and recipes for perfume-making and perfume-making equipment, such as the [[alembic]] (which still bears its Arabic name.&lt;ref&gt;al-Hassani, Woodcok and Saoud (2006) 1001 Inventions; Muslim Heritage in Our World, FSTC, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author= M.

[[File:Arheologicheski-Perfume.jpg|thumb|A Byzantine [[alembic]] used to distil perfumes.]]

The Persian chemist Ibn Sina (also known as [[Avicenna]]) introduced the process of extracting oils from flowers by means of [[distillation]], the procedure most commonly used today. He first experimented with the [[rose]]. Until his discovery, liquid perfumes consisted of mixtures of oil and crushed herbs or petals, which made a strong blend. [[Rose water]] was more delicate, and immediately became popular. Both the raw ingredients and the distillation technology significantly influenced western perfumery and scientific developments, particularly [[chemistry]].

The art of perfumery was known in western Europe from 1221, taking into account the [[monk]]s' recipes of Santa Maria delle Vigne or [[Santa Maria Novella]] of [[Florence]], Italy.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} In the east, the [[Hungarians]] produced in 1370 a perfume made of scented oils blended in an alcohol solution – best known as [[Hungary Water]] – at the behest of [[Elisabeth of Poland|Queen Elizabeth of Hungary]]. The art of perfumery prospered in [[Renaissance]] Italy, and in the 16th century the personal perfumer to [[Catherine de' Medici]] (1519–1589), Rene the [[Florence|Florentine]] (Renato il fiorentino), took Italian refinements to France. His laboratory was connected with her apartments by a secret passageway, so that no formulae could be stolen en route. Thanks to Rene, France quickly became one of the European centers of perfume and [[cosmetics]] manufacture. Cultivation of flowers for their perfume essence, which had begun in the 14th century, grew into a major industry in the south of France.

Between the 16th and 17th centuries, perfumes were used primarily by the wealthy to mask [[body odor]]s resulting from infrequent bathing. Partly due to this patronage, the perfume industry developed. In 1693, Italian barber Giovanni Paolo Feminis created a perfume water called Aqua Admirabilis,&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite book

By the 18th century the [[Grasse]] region of France, [[Sicily]], and [[Calabria]] (in Italy) were growing aromatic plants to provide the growing perfume industry with raw materials. Even today, Italy and France remain the center of European perfume design and [[trade]].

Perfume types reflect the concentration of aromatic compounds in a solvent, which in fine fragrance is typically [[ethanol]] or a mix of water and ethanol. Various sources differ considerably in the definitions of perfume types. The intensity and longevity of a perfume is based on the concentration, intensity and longevity of the aromatic compounds, or perfume oils, used. As the percentage of aromatic compounds increases, so does the intensity and longevity of the scent. Specific terms are used to describe a fragrance's approximate concentration by the percent of perfume oil in the volume of the final product. The most widespread terms&lt;ref name="NYT71218"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Tynan Sinks |title=The Difference Between Perfume, Cologne and Other Fragrances |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/smarter-living/differences-perfume-cologne-fragrance.html?fb=0&amp;recb=home-living.control&amp;recid=17KSsjadYlQApm7TCIQPhRUe8tk&amp;contentCollection=smarter-living&amp;mData=articles%255B%255D%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nytimes.com%252F2018%252F07%252F12%252Fsmarter-living%252Fdifferences-perfume-cologne-fragrance.html%253Ffb%253D0%2526recb%253Dhome-living.control%2526recid%253D17KSsjadYlQApm7TCIQPhRUe8tk%26articles%255B%255D%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nytimes.com%252F2018%252F07%252F11%252Fsmarter-living%252Fhow-to-start-knitting.html%253Ffb%253D0%2526recb%253Dhome-living.control%2526recid%253D17KSsjadYlQApm7TCIQPhRUe8tk&amp;hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=smarterLiving-promo-region&amp;region=smarterLiving-promo-region&amp;WT.nav=smarterLiving-promo-region |accessdate=July 13, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=July 12, 2018 |quote=You’ll see all sorts of names in the fragrance section: perfume, eau de toilette, parfum, eau de cologne. What makes them different — and in many cases, more expensive?}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* '''parfum''' or '''extrait''', in English known as perfume extract, pure perfume, or simply perfume: 15–40% aromatic compounds ([[International Fragrance Association|IFRA]]: typically ~20%);
* '''esprit de parfum''' (ESdP): 15–30% aromatic compounds, a seldom used strength concentration in between EdP and perfume;
* '''eau de parfum''' (EdP) or '''parfum de toilette''' (PdT) (The strength usually sold as "perfume"&lt;ref name="NYT71218"/&gt;): 10–20% aromatic compounds (typically ~15%); sometimes called "eau de perfume" or "millésime"; parfum de toilette is a less common term, most popular in the 1980s, that is generally analogous to eau de parfum;
* '''[[eau de toilette]]''' (EdT): 5–15% aromatic compounds (typically ~10%);
* '''[[eau de Cologne]]''' (EdC): often simply called cologne: 3–8% aromatic compounds (typically ~5%); see below for more information on the confusing nature of the term "cologne";
* '''eau fraiche''': products sold as "splashes", "mists", "veils" and other imprecise terms. Generally these products contain 3% or less aromatic compounds and are diluted with water rather than oil or alcohol.&lt;ref name="NYT71218"/&gt;

There is much confusion over the term "cologne", which has three meanings. The first and oldest definition refers to a family of fresh, citrus-based fragrances distilled using extracts from citrus, floral, and woody ingredients. Supposedly these were first developed in the early 18th century in [[Cologne, Germany]], hence the name. This type of "classical cologne" describes unisex compositions "which are basically citrus blends and do not have a perfume parent."&lt;ref name="Glossary C"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary (C) |url=http://www.fragrance.org/glossary.php?l=C |publisher=The Fragrance Foundation |accessdate=7 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731203552/http://www.fragrance.org/glossary.php?l=C |archivedate=31 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include Mäurer &amp; Wirtz's ''[[4711]]'' (created in 1799), and Guerlain's ''Eau de Cologne Impériale'' (1853).

In the 20th century, the term took on a second meaning. Fragrance companies began to offer lighter, less concentrated interpretations of their existing perfumes, making their products available to a wider range of customers. Guerlain, for example, offered an Eau de Cologne version of its flagship perfume ''[[Shalimar (perfume)|Shalimar]]''. In contrast to classical colognes, this type of modern cologne is a lighter, diluted, less concentrated interpretation of a more concentrated product, typically a pure parfum. The cologne version is often the lightest concentration from a line of fragrance products.&lt;ref name="Glossary C"/&gt;

Finally, the term "cologne" has entered the English language as a generic, overarching term to denote a fragrance worn by a man, regardless of its concentration. The actual product worn by a man may technically be an eau de toilette, but he may still say that he "wears cologne". A similar problem surrounds the term "perfume", which can be used a generic sense to refer to fragrances marketed to women, whether or not the fragrance is actually an extrait.

Classical colognes first appeared in Europe in the 17th century. The first fragrance labeled a "parfum" extract with a high concentration of aromatic compounds was Guerlain's ''[[Jicky]]'' in 1889. Eau de Toilette appeared alongside parfum around the turn of the century. The EdP concentration and terminology is the most recent. Parfum de toilette and EdP began to appear in the 1970s and gained popularity in the 1980s.

===Imprecise terminology===
[[File:J.B. Filz Vienna 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|J.B. Filz in Vienna. Perfumeries with long traditions, such as J.B. Filz, created their own scents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wien.info/en/lifestyle-scene/trendy/scents-from-vienna|title=Scents from Vienna|work=wien.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The wide range in the percentages of aromatic compounds that may be present in each concentration means that the terminology of extrait, EdP, EdT, and EdC is quite imprecise. Although an EdP will often be more concentrated than an EdT and in turn an EdC, this is not always the case. Different perfumeries or perfume houses assign different amounts of oils to each of their perfumes. Therefore, although the oil concentration of a perfume in EdP dilution will necessarily be higher than the same perfume in EdT from within a company's same range, the actual amounts vary among perfume houses. An EdT from one house may have a higher concentration of aromatic compounds than an EdP from another.

Furthermore, some fragrances with the same ''product name'' but having a different ''concentration'' may not only differ in their dilutions, but actually use different perfume oil mixtures altogether. For instance, in order to make the EdT version of a fragrance brighter and fresher than its EdP, the EdT oil may be "tweaked" to contain slightly more top notes or fewer base notes. ''[[Chanel No. 5]]'' is a good example: its parfum, EdP, EdT, and now-discontinued EdC concentrations are in fact different compositions (the parfum dates to 1921, whereas the EdP was not developed until the 1980s). In some cases, words such as ''extrême'', ''intense'', or ''concentrée'' that might indicate a higher aromatic concentration are actually completely different fragrances, related only because of a similar perfume ''accord''. An example of this is Chanel's ''Pour Monsieur'' and ''Pour Monsieur Concentrée''.

As a rule of thumb, women's fragrances tend to have higher levels of aromatic compounds than men's fragrances. Fragrances marketed to men are typically sold as EdT or EdC, rarely as EdP or perfume extracts. Women's fragrances used to be common in all levels of concentration, but today are mainly seen in parfum, EdP and EdT concentrations.

===Solvent types===
Perfume oils are often diluted with a solvent, though this is not always the case, and its necessity is disputed. By far the most common solvent for perfume is oil dilution is an alcohol solution, typically a mixture of ethanol and water or a [[rectified spirit]]. Perfume oil can also be diluted by means of neutral-smelling oils such as fractionated [[coconut oil]], or liquid [[wax]]es such as [[jojoba oil]].

===Applying fragrances===
The conventional application of pure perfume (parfum extrait) in Western cultures is at pulse points, such as behind the ears, the nape of the neck, and the insides of wrists, elbows and knees, so that the pulse point will warm the perfume and release fragrance continuously. According to perfumer [[Sophia Grojsman]] behind the knees is the ideal point to apply perfume in order that the scent may rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://forward.com/news/144873/perfume-nose-conjures-up-perfect-scents/ | title=Perfume 'Nose' Conjures Up Perfect Scents | publisher=forward.com | accessdate=8 August 2015 | author=Berger, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern perfume industry encourages the practice of layering fragrance so that it is released in different intensities depending upon the time of the day. Lightly scented products such as bath oil, shower gel, and body lotion are recommended for the morning; eau de toilette is suggested for the afternoon; and perfume applied to the pulse points for evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Agata A.

==Describing a perfume==
[[File:Fougère Royale by Paul Parquet - Bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|An original bottle of ''Fougère Royale'' by [[Houbigant Parfum|Houbigant]]. Created by [[Paul Parquet]] in 1884, it is one of the most important modern perfumes and inspired the eponymous [[Fougère]] class of fragrances.]]

[[File:Fragrance pyramid.svg|thumb|upright|Fragrance pyramid]]

The precise formulae of commercial perfumes are kept [[Trade secret|secret]]. Even if they were widely published, they would be dominated by such complex ingredients and odorants that they would be of little use in providing a guide to the general consumer in description of the ''experience'' of a scent. Nonetheless, connoisseurs of perfume can become extremely skillful at identifying components and origins of scents in the same manner as wine experts.&lt;ref name=Burr&gt;{{cite book | author=Burr, Chandler | title=The Emperor of Scent: A Story of Perfume, Obsession, and the Last Mystery of the Senses | year=2003 | location=New York | publisher=Random House | isbn=0-375-50797-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most practical way to start describing a perfume is according to the elements of the ''fragrance notes'' of the scent or the "family" it belongs to, all of which affect the overall impression of a perfume from first application to the last lingering hint of scent.&lt;ref name=Fortineau&gt;Perfume connoisseurs speak of a fragrance's "sillage", or the discernible trail it leaves in the air when applied. Fortineau, Anne-Dominique (2004). "Chemistry Perfumes Your Daily Life". ''Journal of Chemical Education''.81(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edwards1&gt;Edwards, Michael (2006). "Fragrances of the World 2006". ''Crescent House Publishing''. {{ISBN|0-9756097-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trail of scent left behind by a person wearing perfume is called its ''sillage'', after the French word for "[[wake]]", as in the trail left by a boat in water.

===Fragrance notes===
{{main| Note (perfumery)}}

Perfume is described in a musical metaphor as having three sets of ''notes'', making the harmonious scent ''accord''. The notes unfold over time, with the immediate impression of the top note leading to the deeper middle notes, and the base notes gradually appearing as the final stage. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process of the perfume.
*'''Top notes''': Also called the '''''head notes'''''. The scents that are perceived immediately on application of a perfume. Top notes consist of small, light molecules that evaporate quickly. They form a person's initial impression of a perfume and thus are very important in the selling of a perfume. Examples of top notes include mint, lavender and coriander.
*'''Middle notes''': Also referred to as '''''heart notes'''''. The scent of a perfume that emerges just prior to the dissipation of the top note. The middle note compounds form the "''heart''" or main body of a perfume and act to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes, which become more pleasant with time. Examples of middle notes include seawater, sandalwood and jasmine.
*'''Base notes''': The scent of a perfume that appears close to the departure of the middle notes. The base and middle notes together are the main theme of a perfume. Base notes bring depth and solidity to a perfume. Compounds of this class of scents are typically rich and "deep" and are usually not perceived until 30 minutes after application. Examples of base notes include tobacco, amber and musk.
The scents in the top and middle notes are influenced by the base notes; conversely, the scents of the base notes will be altered by the types of fragrance materials used as middle notes. Manufacturers who publish perfume notes typically do so with the fragrance components presented as a ''fragrance pyramid''&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.lebermuth.com/fragrance-101-understanding-the-fragrance-pyramid Fragrance 101 Understanding The Fragrance Pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt;, using imaginative and abstract terms for the components listed.

===Olfactive families===
Grouping perfumes can never be a completely objective or final process. Many fragrances contain aspects of different families. Even a perfume designated as "single flower", however subtle, will have undertones of other aromatics. "True" unitary scents can rarely be found in perfumes as it requires the perfume to exist only as a singular aromatic material.

Classification by olfactive family is a starting point for a description of a perfume, but it cannot by itself denote the specific characteristic of that perfume.

====Traditional====

[[File:Opium by YSL.jpg|thumb|upright|Opium by YSL, of amber or oriental fragrance class]]
[[File:Joy Jean Patou.jpg|thumb|upright|A floral bouquet, Joy from [[Jean Patou]]]]
The traditional classification which emerged around 1900 comprised the following categories:
*'''Single Floral''': Fragrances that are dominated by a scent from one particular flower; in French called a ''soliflore''. (e.g. [[Serge Lutens]]' ''Sa Majeste La Rose'', which is dominated by rose.)
*'''Floral Bouquet''': Is a combination of fragrance of several flowers in a perfume compound. Examples include ''Quelques Fleurs'' by [[Houbigant (perfume)|Houbigant]] and ''[[Joy (perfume)|Joy]]'' by [[Jean Patou]].
*'''Amber or "Oriental"''': A large fragrance class featuring the sweet slightly animalic scents of [[ambergris]] or [[labdanum]], often combined with [[vanilla]], [[tonka bean]], flowers and woods. Can be enhanced by camphorous oils and [[incense]] resins, which bring to mind [[Victorian era]] imagery of the Middle East and [[Far East]]. Traditional examples include [[Guerlain]]'s ''[[Shalimar (perfume)|Shalimar]]'', [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]]'s ''[[Opium (perfume)|Opium]]'' and Chanel's ''Coco Mademoiselle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanel.com/en_US/fragrance-beauty/Fragrance-Coco-Mademoiselle-COCO-MADEMOISELLE-PARFUM-88207|title=Coco Mademoiselle from Chanel|publisher=www.chanel.com |accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Woody''': Fragrances that are dominated by woody scents, typically of [[agarwood]], [[sandalwood]], [[cedar wood|cedarwood]], and [[vetiver]]. Patchouli, with its [[camphor]]aceous smell, is commonly found in these perfumes. A traditional example here would be Myrurgia's ''Maderas De Oriente'' or [[Chanel]] ''Bois des Îles''. A modern example would be [[Balenciaga]] ''Rumba''.
*'''Leather''': A family of fragrances which features the scents of [[honey]], [[tobacco]], wood and wood [[tar]]s in its middle or base notes and a scent that alludes to leather. Traditional examples include [[Robert Piguet]]'s ''Bandit'' and [[Pierre Balmain|Balmain]]'s ''Jolie Madame''.
*'''[[Chypre]]''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃipʁ|IPA}}): Meaning ''[[Cyprus]]'' in French, this includes fragrances built on a similar accord consisting of [[bergamot orange|bergamot]], [[oakmoss]], and [[labdanum]]. This family of fragrances is named after the eponymous 1917 perfume by [[François Coty]], and one of the most famous extant examples is [[Guerlain]]'s ''[[Mitsouko (perfume)|Mitsouko]]''.
*'''[[Fougère]]''' ({{IPA-fr|fu.ʒɛʁ|IPA}}): Meaning ''[[fern]]'' in French, built on a base of [[lavender]], [[coumarin]] and [[oakmoss]]. [[Houbigant (perfume)|Houbigant]]'s ''Fougère Royale'' pioneered the use of this base. Many men's fragrances belong to this family of fragrances, which is characterized by its sharp herbaceous and woody scent. Some well-known modern fougères are [[Fabergé]] ''Brut'' and [[Guy Laroche]] ''Drakkar Noir''.

====Modern====
Since 1945, due to great advances in the technology of perfume creation (i.e., compound design and synthesis) as well as the natural development of styles and tastes, new categories have emerged to describe modern scents:
*'''Bright Floral''': combining the traditional Single Floral &amp; Floral Bouquet categories. A good example would be [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]]'s ''Beautiful''.
*'''Green''': a lighter and more modern interpretation of the Chypre type, with pronounced cut grass, crushed green leaf and cucumber-like scents. Examples include Estée Lauder's ''Aliage'', Sisley's ''Eau de Campagne'', and Calvin Klein's ''Eternity''.
*'''Aquatic''', '''Oceanic''', or '''Ozonic''': the newest category in perfume history, first appearing in 1988 [[Davidoff]] ''[[Cool Water (perfume)|Cool Water]]'' (1988), Christian Dior's ''Dune'' (1991), and many others. A clean smell reminiscent of the ocean, leading to many of the modern [[androgynous]] perfumes. Generally contains [[calone]], a synthetic scent discovered in 1966, or other more recent synthetics. Also used to accent floral, oriental, and woody fragrances.
*'''Citrus''': An old fragrance family that until recently consisted mainly of "freshening" eau de colognes, due to the low tenacity of citrus scents. Development of newer fragrance compounds has allowed for the creation of primarily citrus fragrances. A good example here would be Faberge ''Brut''.
*'''Fruity''': featuring the aromas of fruits other than citrus, such as peach, cassis (black currant), mango, passion fruit, and others. A modern example here would be Ginestet ''Botrytis''.
*'''Gourmand''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡuʁmɑ̃|lang}}): scents with "edible" or "dessert"-like qualities. These often contain notes like vanilla, [[tonka bean]] and [[coumarin]], as well as synthetic components designed to resemble food flavors. A sweet example is [[Thierry Mugler]]'s ''Angel''.

====Fragrance wheel====
{{main|Fragrance wheel}}
[[File:Wheel2.gif|thumb|Fragrance Wheel perfume [[classification chart]], ver. 1983]]
The Fragrance wheel is a relatively new classification method that is widely used in retail and in the fragrance industry. The method was created in 1983 by [[Michael Edwards (fragrance expert)|Michael Edwards]], a consultant in the perfume industry, who designed his own scheme of fragrance classification. The new scheme was created in order to simplify fragrance classification and naming scheme, as well as to show the relationships between each of the individual classes.&lt;ref name="OGrantInterview"&gt;{{cite web |author= Osborne, Grant |date= 1 May 2001 |title= Interview with Michael Edwards |url= http://www.basenotes.net/interviews/int-medwards.html |accessdate= 17 December 2006 |publisher= Basenotes |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070206133603/http://www.basenotes.net/interviews/int-medwards.html |archivedate= 6 February 2007 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five standard families consist of ''Floral'', ''Oriental'', ''Woody'', ''Aromatic Fougère'', and ''Fresh'', with the first four families borrowing from the classic terminology and the last consisting of newer bright and clean smelling citrus and oceanic fragrances that have arrived in the past generation due to improvements in fragrance technology. Each of the families are in turn divided into subgroups and arranged around a wheel.
In this classification scheme, ''Chanel No.5'', which is traditionally classified as an aldehydic floral, would be located under the Soft Floral sub-group, and amber scents would be placed within the Oriental group. As a class, [[chypre]] perfumes are more difficult to place since they would be located under parts of the Oriental and Woody families. For instance, Guerlain's ''Mitsouko'' is placed under Mossy Woods, but Hermès ''Rouge'', a chypre with more floral character, would be placed under Floral Oriental.

==Aromatics sources==

===Plant sources===
[[File:Citrus x limon Blüten und Schädlinge.JPG|thumb|upright|Citrus tree blossom]]
[[File:Myrrh.JPG|thumb|Resins in perfumery include [[myrrh]]]]
[[File:Frankincense 2005-12-31.jpg|thumb|Frankincense]]

Plants have long been used in perfumery as a source of essential oils and aroma compounds. These aromatics are usually [[secondary metabolites]] produced by plants as protection against [[herbivore]]s, infections, as well as to attract [[pollinator]]s. Plants are by far the largest source of fragrant compounds used in perfumery. The sources of these compounds may be derived from various parts of a plant. A plant can offer more than one source of aromatics, for instance the aerial portions and seeds of [[coriander]] have remarkably different odors from each other. [[Orange (fruit)|Orange]] leaves, blossoms, and fruit zest are the respective sources of [[petitgrain]], [[neroli]], and [[orange oil]]s.
* '''[[Bark (botany)|Bark]]''': Commonly used barks include [[cinnamon]] and [[cascarilla]]. The fragrant oil in [[sassafras]] root bark is also used either directly or purified for its main constituent, [[safrole]], which is used in the synthesis of other fragrant compounds.
* '''[[Flower]]s''' and '''[[blossom]]s''': Undoubtedly the largest and most common source of perfume aromatics. Includes the flowers of several species of [[rose]] and [[jasmine]], as well as [[osmanthus]], [[plumeria]], [[Acacia farnesiana|mimosa]], [[tuberose]], [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]], [[Pelargonium graveolens|scented geranium]], [[Vachellia farnesiana|cassie]], [[ambrette]] as well as the blossoms of [[citrus]] and [[ylang-ylang]] trees. Although not traditionally thought of as a flower, the unopened flower buds of the [[clove]] are also commonly used. Most orchid flowers are not commercially used to produce essential oils or absolutes, except in the case of [[vanilla]], an orchid, which must be pollinated first and made into seed pods before use in perfumery.
* '''[[Fruit]]s''': Fresh fruits such as [[apple]]s, [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[cherry|cherries]] rarely yield the expected odors when extracted; if such fragrance notes are found in a perfume, they are more likely to be of synthetic origin. Notable exceptions include blackcurrant leaf, [[litsea|litsea cubeba]], vanilla, and [[juniper|juniper berry]]. The most commonly used fruits yield their aromatics from the rind; they include citrus such as [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[lemon]]s, and [[lime (fruit)|limes]]. Although [[grapefruit]] rind is still used for aromatics, more and more commercially used grapefruit aromatics are artificially synthesized since the natural aromatic contains [[sulfur]] and its degradation product is quite unpleasant in smell.
* '''[[Leaves]]''' and '''[[twigs]]''': Commonly used for perfumery are [[lavender]] leaf, [[patchouli]], [[Common sage|sage]], [[violet (plant)|violets]], [[rosemary]], and citrus leaves. Sometimes leaves are valued for the "green" smell they bring to perfumes, examples of this include [[hay]] and [[tomato]] leaf.
* '''[[Resin]]s''': Valued since antiquity, resins have been widely used in [[incense]] and perfumery. Highly fragrant and antiseptic resins and resin-containing perfumes have been used by many cultures as medicines for a large variety of ailments. Commonly used resins in perfumery include [[labdanum]], [[frankincense]]/[[olibanum]], [[myrrh]], [[balsam of Peru]], [[benzoin (resin)|benzoin]]. [[Pine]] and [[fir]] resins are a particularly valued source of [[terpene]]s used in the [[organic synthesis]] of many other synthetic or naturally occurring aromatic compounds. Some of what is called [[amber]] and [[copal]] in perfumery today is the resinous secretion of fossil [[conifer]]s.
*'''[[Root]]s, [[rhizome]]s and [[bulb]]s''': Commonly used terrestrial portions in perfumery include [[iris (plant)|iris]] [[rhizome]]s, [[vetiver]] roots, various rhizomes of the [[ginger]] family.
* '''[[Seed]]s''': Commonly used seeds include [[tonka bean]], [[Daucus carota|carrot seed]], [[coriander]], [[caraway]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[nutmeg]], [[mace (spice)|mace]], [[cardamom]], and [[anise]].
* '''[[Wood]]s''': Highly important in providing the base notes to a perfume, wood oils and distillates are indispensable in perfumery. Commonly used woods include [[sandalwood]], [[rosewood]], [[agarwood]], [[birch]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[juniper]], and [[pine]]. These are used in the form of macerations or dry-distilled (rectified) forms.
*'''Rom [[terpenes]]'''. Orchid scents

===Animal sources===

[[File:Ambergris.jpg|thumb|[[Ambergris]]]]
*'''[[Ambergris]]''': Lumps of [[oxidize]]d fatty compounds, whose precursors were secreted and expelled by the [[sperm whale]]. Ambergris should not be confused with [[amber|yellow amber]], which is used in jewelry. Because the harvesting of ambergris involves no harm to its animal source, it remains one of the few animalic fragrancing agents around which little controversy now exists.
*'''[[Castoreum]]''': Obtained from the odorous sacs of the North American beaver.
*'''[[Civet (perfumery)|Civet]]''': Also called civet musk, this is obtained from the odorous sacs of the civets, animals in the family ''Viverridae'', related to the [[mongoose]].

*'''[[Honeycomb]]''': From the honeycomb of the [[honeybee]]. Both beeswax and honey can be solvent extracted to produce an absolute. Beeswax is extracted with ethanol and the ethanol evaporated to produce beeswax absolute.
*'''[[Musk]]''': Originally derived from a gland (sac or pod) located between the genitals and the umbilicus of the Himalayan male [[musk deer]] Moschus moschiferus, it has now mainly been replaced by the use of [[synthetic musk]]s sometimes known as "white musk".

===Other natural sources===
* '''[[Lichen]]s''': Commonly used lichens include [[oakmoss]] and [[treemoss]] thalli.
* '''[[Brown algae|"Seaweed"]]''': Distillates are sometimes used as [[essential oil]] in perfumes. An example of a commonly used seaweed is ''[[Fucus vesiculosus]]'', which is commonly referred to as bladder wrack. Natural seaweed fragrances are rarely used due to their higher cost and lower potency than synthetics.

===Synthetic sources===
{{main| Aroma compound}}
Many modern perfumes contain [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] odorants. Synthetics can provide fragrances which are not found in nature. For instance, [[Calone]], a compound of synthetic origin, imparts a fresh ozonous metallic marine scent that is widely used in contemporary perfumes. Synthetic aromatics are often used as an alternate source of compounds that are not easily obtained from natural sources. For example, [[linalool]] and [[coumarin]] are both naturally occurring compounds that can be inexpensively synthesized from [[terpenes]]. Orchid scents (typically ''[[salicylic acid|salicylates]]'') are usually not obtained directly from the plant itself but are instead synthetically created to match the fragrant compounds found in various orchids.

One of the most commonly used classes of synthetic aromatics by far are the [[synthetic musk|white musk]]s. These materials are found in all forms of commercial perfumes as a neutral background to the middle notes. These musks are added in large quantities to laundry detergents in order to give washed clothes a lasting "clean" scent.

The majority of the world's synthetic aromatics are created by relatively few [[:Category:Fragrance companies|companies]]. They include:
* [[International Flavors and Fragrances]] (IFF)
* [[Givaudan]]
* [[Firmenich]]
* [[Takasago International Corporation|Takasago]]
* [[Symrise]]
Each of these companies patents several processes for the production of aromatic synthetics annually.

|-
!|Variance
|Natural scents will vary from each supplier based on when and where they are harvested, how they are processed, and the extraction method itself. This means that a certain flower grown in Morocco and in France will smell different, even if the same method is used to grow, harvest, and extract the scent. As such, each perfumer will prefer flowers grown in one country over another, or one extraction method to the next. However, due to a natural scent's mixed composition, it is easy for unscrupulous suppliers to adulterate the actual raw materials by changing its ''source'' (adding Indian jasmine into Grasse jasmine) or the ''contents'' (adding linalool to rosewood) to increase their [[profit margin]].
|Much more consistent than natural aromatics. However, differences in organic synthesis may result in minute differences in concentration of impurities. If these impurities have low smell (detection) thresholds, the differences in the scent of the synthetic aromatic will be significant.
|-
!|Components
|Contains many different organic compounds, each adding a different note to the overall scent. Certain naturally derived substances have a long history of use, but this cannot always be used as an indicator of whether they are safe or not. Possible allergenic or carcinogenic compounds.
|Depending on purity, consists primarily of one chemical compound. Sometimes [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] mixtures of isomers, such as in the case of [[Iso E Super]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iso E Super® |publisher=International Flavors &amp; Fragrances |year=2007 |url=http://www.iff.com/Ingredients.nsf/0/E69A1213546C4F8B80256993003995C6 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223080634/http://www.iff.com/Ingredients.nsf/0/E69A1213546C4F8B80256993003995C6 |archivedate=23 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the almost pure composition of one chemical compound, the same molecules found diluted in nature will have a different scent and effect on the body, if used undiluted.
|-
!|Scent uniqueness
|Reminiscent of its originating material, although extraction may capture a different "layer" of the scent, depending on the how the extraction method denatures the odoriferous compounds.
|Similar to natural scents yet different at the same time. Some synthetics attempt to mimic natural notes, while others explore the entire spectrum of scent. Novel scent compounds not found in nature will often be unique in their scent.
|-
!|Scent complexity
|Deep and complex fragrance notes. Soft, with subtle scent nuances. Highly valued for ideal composition.
|Pure and pronounced fragrance notes. Often monotonous in nature, yet reminiscent of other natural scents.
|-
!|Price
|Dependent on extraction method. More expensive, but not always, as prices are determined by the labor and difficulty of properly extracting each unit of the natural materials, as well as its quality. Typically the relationship between, longevity of a perfume, cost and the concentration of essential oils follows the graph below:
[[File:Cologne Strength vs. Cost vs. Cologne Concentration.jpg|thumb|This chart shows the typical relationship between price of perfume, its longevity and the concentration of essential oils.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost Curve|url=http://www.topcolognesformen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|Dependent on synthesis method. Generally cheaper, but not necessarily. Synthetic aromatics are not necessarily cheaper than naturals, with some synthetics being more costly than most natural ingredients due to various factors such as the long synthesis routes, low availability of precursor chemicals, and low overall yield. However, due to their low odor threshold, they should be diluted when making a perfume.

==Obtaining natural odorants==
{{main|Fragrance extraction}}
[[File:Itar vendor in Hyderabad.JPG|thumb|Itar (herbal perfume) vendor on the street of [[Hyderabad]], India, who can compose an original perfume for the customer]]
Before perfumes can be composed, the odorants used in various perfume compositions must first be obtained. Synthetic odorants are produced through [[organic synthesis]] and purified. Odorants from natural sources require the use of various methods to extract the aromatics from the raw materials. The results of the extraction are either [[essential oil]]s, absolutes, concretes, or butters, depending on the amount of [[wax]]es in the extracted product.&lt;ref name=Camps&gt;Camps, Arcadi Boix (2000). "Perfumery Techniques in Evolution". ''Allured Pub Corp''. {{ISBN|0-931710-72-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these techniques will, to a certain extent, distort the odor of the aromatic compounds obtained from the raw materials. This is due to the use of heat, harsh solvents, or through exposure to oxygen in the extraction process which will denature the aromatic compounds, which either change their odor character or renders them odorless.
* '''[[Solvent extraction|Maceration/Solvent extraction]]''': The most used and economically important technique for extracting aromatics in the modern perfume industry. Raw materials are submerged in a solvent that can dissolve the desired aromatic compounds. ''Maceration'' lasts anywhere from hours to months. Fragrant compounds for woody and fibrous plant materials are often obtained in this manner as are all aromatics from animal sources. The technique can also be used to extract odorants that are too volatile for ''distillation'' or easily [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] by heat. Commonly used solvents for ''maceration/solvent extraction'' include [[ethane]], [[hexane]], and [[dimethyl ether]]. The product of this process is called a "[[Concrete (perfumery)|concrete]]."
** ''[[Supercritical fluid extraction]]'': A relatively new technique for extracting fragrant compounds from a raw material, which often employs [[Supercritical carbon dioxide|Supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Due to the low heat of process and the relatively nonreactive solvent used in the extraction, the fragrant compounds derived often closely resemble the original odor of the raw material.
**''[[Ethanol extraction]]'': A type of solvent extraction used to extract fragrant compounds directly from dry raw materials, as well as the impure oily compounds materials resulting from solvent extraction or enfleurage. Ethanol extraction from fresh plant materials contain large quantities of water, which will also be extracted into the ethanol.
* '''[[Distillation]]''': A common technique for obtaining aromatic compounds from [[plant]]s, such as [[orange blossom]]s and [[rose]]s. The raw material is heated and the fragrant compounds are re-collected through [[condensation]] of the distilled vapor.
[[File:Fragonard small perfume distillery.JPG|thumb|upright|An old perfume still on display at [[Musée du Parfum|Fragonard]]]]
** ''Steam distillation'': Steam from boiling water is passed through the raw material, which drives out their volatile fragrant compounds. The condensate from distillation are settled in a [[Florentine flask]]. This allows for the easy separation of the fragrant oils from the water. The water collected from the condensate, which retains some of the fragrant compounds and oils from the raw material is called [[hydrosol]] and sometimes sold. This is most commonly used for fresh plant materials such as [[flower]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], and [[Plant stem|stems]].
** ''Dry/destructive distillation'': The raw materials are directly heated in a still without a carrier solvent such as water. Fragrant compounds that are released from the raw material by the high heat often undergo anhydrous [[pyrolysis]], which results in the formation of different fragrant compounds, and thus different fragrant notes. This method is used to obtain fragrant compounds from fossil [[amber]] and fragrant [[wood]]s where an intentional "burned" or "toasted" odor is desired.
** ''Fractionation'': Through the use of a [[fractionation column]], different fractions distilled from a material can be selectively excluded to modify the scent of the final product. Although the product is more expensive, this is sometimes performed to remove unpleasant or undesirable scents of a material and affords the perfumer more control over their composition process.
* '''Expression''': Raw material is squeezed or compressed and the [[essential oil]]s are collected. Of all raw materials, only the fragrant oils from the peels of fruits in the citrus family are extracted in this manner since the oil is present in large enough quantities as to make this extraction method economically feasible.
* '''[[Enfleurage]]''': Absorption of aroma materials into solid fat or wax and then extraction of odorous oils with [[ethanol|ethyl alcohol]]. Extraction by [[enfleurage]] was commonly used when [[distillation]] was not possible because some fragrant compounds [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] through high heat. This technique is not commonly used in the modern industry due to prohibitive costs and the existence of more efficient and effective extraction methods.&lt;ref name=Fortineau/&gt;

==Fragrant extracts==
[[File:38034290 aromater3.jpg|thumb|upright|Indian Patchouli - Tincture]]
Although fragrant extracts are known to the general public as the generic term "[[essential oil]]s", a more specific language is used in the fragrance industry to describe the source, purity, and technique used to obtain a particular fragrant extract.
Of these extracts, only ''absolutes'', ''essential oils'', and ''tinctures'' are directly used to formulate perfumes.
*'''Absolute''': Fragrant materials that are purified from a ''pommade'' or ''concrete'' by soaking them in [[ethanol]]. By using a slightly [[hydrophilic]] compound such as ethanol, most of the fragrant compounds from the waxy source materials can be extracted without dissolving any of the fragrantless waxy molecules. Absolutes are usually found in the form of an oily liquid.
*'''Concrete''': Fragrant materials that have been extracted from raw materials through ''solvent extraction'' using volatile [[hydrocarbon]]s. Concretes usually contain a large amount of wax due to the ease in which the solvents dissolve various [[hydrophobic]] compounds. As such concretes are usually further purified through distillation or ethanol based solvent extraction. Concretes are typically either waxy or resinous solids or thick oily liquids.
*'''[[Essential oil]]''': Fragrant materials that have been extracted from a source material directly through ''distillation'' or ''expression'' and obtained in the form of an oily liquid. Oils extracted through expression are sometimes called ''expression oils''.
*'''Pomade''': A fragrant mass of solid fat created from the ''[[enfleurage]]'' process, in which odorous compounds in raw materials are adsorbed into animal fats. Pommades are found in the form of an oily and sticky solid.
*'''[[Tincture]]''': Fragrant materials produced by directly soaking and infusing raw materials in [[ethanol]]. Tinctures are typically thin liquids.&lt;ref name=Fortineau/&gt;

Products from different extraction methods are known under different names even though their starting materials are the same. For instance, orange blossoms from ''[[Citrus aurantium]]'' that have undergone solvent extraction produces "orange blossom absolute" but that which have been steam distilled is known as "neroli oil".

==Composing perfumes==
[[File:Lesbos - Perfume formula by Will Inrig.jpg|thumb|Perfume formula]]

Perfume compositions are an important part of many industries ranging from the luxury goods sectors, food services industries, to manufacturers of various household chemicals. The purpose of using perfume or fragrance compositions in these industries is to affect customers through their [[olfaction|sense of smell]] and entice them into purchasing the perfume or perfumed product. As such there is significant interest in producing a perfume formulation that people will find aesthetically pleasing.

===The perfumer===
{{main|Perfumer}}
[[File:Ernst, Rodolphe - The Perfume Maker.jpg|thumb|left|''The Perfume Maker'', by [[Rodolphe Ernst]]]]
The job of composing perfumes that will be sold is left up to an expert on perfume composition or known in the fragrance industry as the ''perfumer''. They are also sometimes referred to affectionately as a "''Nez''" (French for ''nose'') due to their fine sense of smell and skill in smell composition.

The composition of a perfume typically begins with a ''brief'' by the perfumer's employer or an outside customer. The customers to the perfumer or their employers, are typically fashion houses or large [[corporation]]s of various industries.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, G., Endrissat, N., &amp; Noppeney, C. (2016). Beyond “the Eye” of the Beholder: Scent innovation through analogical reconfiguration. Organization Studies, 0170840615622064. http://doi.org/10.1177/0170840615622064.&lt;/ref&gt; The perfumer will then go through the process of blending multiple perfume mixtures and sell the formulation to the customer, often with modifications of the composition of the perfume. 
The perfume composition will then be either used to enhance another product as a ''functional fragrance'' ([[shampoo]]s, [[make-up]], [[detergent]]s, car interiors, etc.), or marketed and sold directly to the public as a ''fine fragrance''.&lt;ref name=Burr /&gt;

===Technique===
[[File:Blotter strips.jpg|right|thumb|Paper blotters (fr:''mouillettes'') are commonly used by perfumers to sample and smell perfumes and odorants.]]
Although there is no single "correct" technique for the formulation of a perfume, there are general guidelines as to how a perfume can be constructed from a concept. Although many ingredients do not contribute to the smell of a perfume, many perfumes include colorants and anti-oxidants to improve the marketability and shelf life of the perfume, respectively.

====Basic framework====
Perfume oils usually contain tens to hundreds of ingredients and these are typically organized in a perfume for the specific role they will play. These ingredients can be roughly grouped into four groups:
*''Primary scents'' (Heart): Can consist of one or a few main ingredients for a certain concept, such as "rose". Alternatively, multiple ingredients can be used together to create an "abstract" primary scent that does not bear a resemblance to a natural ingredient. For instance, jasmine and rose scents are commonly blends for abstract floral fragrances. [[Cola]] flavourant is a good example of an abstract primary scent.
*''Modifiers'': These ingredients alter the primary scent to give the perfume a certain desired character: for instance, fruit [[ester]]s may be included in a floral primary to create a fruity floral; [[calone]] and citrus scents can be added to create a "fresher" floral. The cherry scent in cherry cola can be considered a modifier.
*''Blenders'': A large group of ingredients that smooth out the transitions of a perfume between different "layers" or bases. These themselves can be used as a major component of the primary scent. Common blending ingredients include [[linalool]] and hydroxycitronellal.
*''Fixatives'': Used to support the primary scent by bolstering it. Many resins, wood scents, and amber bases are used as fixatives.

The top, middle, and base notes of a fragrance may have separate primary scents and supporting ingredients. The perfume's [[fragrance oil]]s are then blended with [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]] and water, aged in tanks for several weeks and filtered through processing equipment to, respectively, allow the perfume ingredients in the mixture to stabilize and to remove any sediment and particles before the solution can be filled into the perfume bottles.&lt;ref name=cbyear&gt;{{Cite book| first=Chandler| last=Burr| title=The Perfect Scent: A Year Inside the Perfume Industry in Paris &amp; New York| publisher=Henry Holt and Co.| year=2008| isbn=978-0-8050-8037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fragrance bases====
[[File:Perfume Organ, Grasse.jpg|upright|thumb|A "perfume organ", where perfumers play around with hundreds of essences, in [[Grasse]]]]
Instead of building a perfume from "ground up", many modern perfumes and colognes are made using ''fragrance bases'' or simply '''bases'''. Each base is essentially modular perfume that is blended from essential oils and aromatic chemicals, and formulated with a simple concept such as "fresh cut grass" or "juicy sour apple". Many of [[Guerlain]]'s ''Aqua Allegoria'' line, with their simple fragrance concepts, are good examples of what perfume fragrance bases are like.

The effort used in developing bases by fragrance companies or individual perfumers may equal that of a marketed perfume, since they are useful in that they are reusable. On top of its reusability, the benefit in using bases for construction are quite numerous:
#Ingredients with "difficult" or "overpowering" scents that are tailored into a blended base may be more easily incorporated into a work of perfume
#A base may be better scent approximations of a certain thing than the extract of the thing itself. For example, a base made to embody the scent for "fresh dewy rose" might be a better approximation for the scent concept of a rose after rain than plain [[rose oil]]. Flowers whose scents cannot be extracted, such as [[gardenia]] or [[hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]], are composed as bases from data derived from [[headspace technology]].
#A perfumer can quickly rough out a concept from a brief by combining multiple bases, then present it for feedback. Smoothing out the "edges" of the perfume can be done after a positive response.

===Reverse engineering===
Creating perfumes through reverse engineering with analytical techniques such as [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry]] (GC/MS) can reveal the "general" formula for any particular perfume. The difficulty of GC/MS analysis arises due to the complexity of a perfume's ingredients. This is particularly due to the presence of natural essential oils and other ingredients consisting of complex chemical mixtures. However, "anyone armed with good GC/MS equipment and experienced in using this equipment can today, within days, find out a great deal about the formulation of any perfume... customers and competitors can analyze most perfumes more or less precisely."&lt;ref&gt;Calkin, Robert R. &amp; Jellinek, J. Stephen (1994). "Perfumery: practice and principles". ''John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.''. {{ISBN|0-471-58934-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antique or badly preserved perfumes undergoing this analysis can also be difficult due to the numerous degradation by-products and impurities that may have resulted from breakdown of the odorous compounds. Ingredients and compounds can usually be ruled out or identified using [[gas chromatograph]] (GC) smellers, which allow individual chemical components to be identified both through their physical properties and their scent. Reverse engineering of best-selling perfumes in the market is a very common practice in the fragrance industry due to the relative simplicity of operating GC equipment, the pressure to produce marketable fragrances, and the highly lucrative nature of the perfume market.&lt;ref name=cbyear/&gt;

===Copyright===
[[File:Fakeperfumes.jpg|right|thumb|[[Counterfeit]] perfumes]]
It is doubtful whether perfumes qualify as appropriate copyright subject matter under the US [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]]. The issue has not yet been addressed by any US court. A perfume's scent is not eligible for [[trademark]] protection because the scent serves as the functional purpose of the product.&lt;ref name="cp"&gt;{{citation | author=David A. Einhorn | author2=Lesley Portnoy | title=The Copyrightability of Perfumes: I Smell a Symphony | journal=Intellectual Property Today |date=April 2010 | url=http://www.iptoday.com/issues/2010/04/the-copyrightability-perfumes-i-smell-symphony.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[Dutch Supreme Court]] granted copyright protection to [[Lancôme]]'s perfume ''Tresor'' (''Lancôme v. Kecofa''). The [[French Supreme Court]] has twice taken the position that perfumes lack the creativity to constitute copyrightable expressions (''Bsiri-Barbir v. Haarman &amp; Reimer'', 2006; ''Beaute Prestige International v. Senteur Mazal'', 2008).&lt;ref name="cp" /&gt;

==Health and environmental issues==

Perfume ingredients, regardless of natural or synthetic origins, may all cause health or environmental problems when used. Although the areas are under active research, much remains to be learned about the effects of fragrance on human health and the environment.

===Health===

====Immunological; asthma and allergy====
Evidence in peer-reviewed journals shows that some fragrances can cause asthmatic reactions in some individuals, especially those with severe or atopic asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kumar P, Caradonna-Graham VM, Gupta S, Cai X, Rao PN, Thompson J |title=Inhalation challenge effects of perfume scent strips in patients with asthma |journal=Ann.

In some cases, an excessive use of perfumes may cause [[allergy|allergic]] reactions of the skin. For instance, [[acetophenone]], [[ethyl acetate]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} and [[acetone]]&lt;ref name=cbyear/&gt; while present in many perfumes, are also known or potential respiratory [[allergen]]s. Nevertheless, this may be misleading, since the harm presented by many of these chemicals (either natural or synthetic) is dependent on environmental conditions and their concentrations in a perfume. For instance, linalool, which is listed as an irritant, causes skin irritation when it degrades to peroxides, however the use of antioxidants in perfumes or reduction in concentrations can prevent this. As well, the [[furanocoumarin]] present in natural extracts of grapefruit or [[celery]] can cause severe allergic reactions and increase sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Furanocoumarins as potent chemical defenses |first=May |last=Berenbaum |url=http://www.life.illinois.edu/berenbaum/newpage1.htm|date=June 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research on natural aromatics have shown that many contain compounds that cause skin irritation.&lt;ref name="udgiv"&gt;Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products [http://www2.mst.dk/common/Udgivramme/Frame.asp?pg=http://www2.mst.dk/udgiv/Publications/2001/87-7944-596-9/html/kap12_eng.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232246/http://www2.mst.dk/common/Udgivramme/Frame.asp?pg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww2.mst.dk%2Fudgiv%2FPublications%2F2001%2F87-7944-596-9%2Fhtml%2Fkap12_eng.htm|date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some studies, such as IFRA's research claim that [[opoponax]] is too dangerous to be used in perfumery, still lack scientific consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_sccp/docs/sccp_o_025b.pdf|title=EC.europa.eu|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also true that sometimes inhalation alone can cause skin irritation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Epikutanni-test.jpg|thumb|[[Patch test]]]]

Wilkinson | chapter=Contact Dermatitis: Allergic | title=Rook's Textbook of Dermatology | volume=2 | edition=8th | year=2010 | publisher=Wiley | page=26.40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balsam of Peru has been banned by the [[International Fragrance Association]] since 1982 from use as a fragrance compound, but may be present as an extract or distillate in other products, where mandatory labelling is not required for usage of 0.4% or less.&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt;

====Carcinogenicity====
There is scientific evidence that nitro-musks such as [[musk xylene]] could cause cancer in some specific animal tests. These reports were evaluated by the EU Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS, formerly the SCCNFP &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/index_en.htm|title=Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) - Public Health - European Commission|website=Public Health|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and musk xylene was found to be safe for continued use in cosmetic products.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/out280_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is in fact part of the procedures of the Cosmetic Regulation in Europe that materials classified as carcinogens require such a safety evaluation by the authorities to be allowed in cosmetic consumer products.

Although other ingredients such as polycyclic [[synthetic musk]]s, have been reported to be positive in some in-vitro hormone assays,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Schreurs RH, Legler J, Artola-Garicano E, etal |title=In vitro and in vivo antiestrogenic effects of polycyclic musks in zebrafish |journal=Environ.

For example, for one of the main polycyclic musks [[Galaxolide|Galaxolide (HHCB)]] these reviews includes those of the EU Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety,&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/out179_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the EU's Priority Substances Review,&lt;ref&gt;http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/947def3b-bbbf-473b-bc19-3bda7a8da910&lt;/ref&gt; the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk,&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scher/docs/scher_o_086.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently also the US EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppt/existingchemicals/pubs/workplans.html|title=TSCA Work Plan Chemicals - Existing Chemicals - OPPT - US EPA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of all of these reviews over the past decade or so is that there is no safety concerns for human health. Reviews with similar positive outcome exists for another main polycyclic musk (AHTN) as well for instance on its safe use in cosmetics by the EU.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/out176_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many natural aromatics, such as oakmoss absolutes,&lt;ref name=udgiv/&gt;&lt;ref name="OakAranol"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Rastogi SC, Bossi R, Johansen JD, etal |title=Content of oak moss allergens atranol and chloroatranol in perfumes and similar products |journal=Contact Derm. |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=367–70 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15274728 |doi=10.1111/j.0105-1873.2004.00379.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[basil]] oil, [[rose oil]] and many others contain allergens or carcinogenic compounds, the safety of which is either governed by regulations (e.g. allowed methyl eugenol levels in the EU Cosmetics Regulation (Entry{{nbsp}}102, Annex{{nbsp}}III of the EU Cosmetics Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2009R1223:20130711:en:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;) or through various limitations set by the International Fragrance Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifraorg.org/en-us/standards|title=standards - IFRA International Fragrance Association - in every sense|website=www.ifraorg.org|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Toxicity====
Certain chemicals found in perfume are often toxic, at least for small insects if not for humans. For example, the compound Tricyclodecenyl allyl ether is often found in synthetic perfumes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/55017187/Insect-Repellents---Patent-6660288|title=Insect Repellents – PDF|work=Docstoc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP1119250.html|title=INSECT REPELLENTS – QUEST INTERNATIONAL B.V.|work=freepatentsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has [[insect repellent]] property.

===Environmental===
[[File:Flickr - dlisbona - Perfume stall in Cairo metro.jpg|thumb|upright|Perfume stall in [[Cairo]]]]

====Pollution====
Synthetic musks are pleasant in smell and relatively inexpensive, as such they are often employed in large quantities to cover the unpleasant scent of laundry detergents and many personal cleaning products. Due to their large-scale use, several types of synthetic musks have been found in human fat and milk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duedahl-Olesen L, Cederberg T, Pedersen KH, Højgård A |title=Synthetic musk fragrances in trout from Danish fish farms and human milk |journal=Chemosphere |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=422–31 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16182860 |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.02.004 |url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/synthetic-musk-fragrances-in-trout-from-danish-fish-farms-and-human-milk(477f6612-140a-40f8-b794-fd61aca8aaab).html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the sediments and waters of the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peck AM, Linebaugh EK, Hornbuckle KC |title=Synthetic Musk Fragrances in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario Sediment Cores |journal=Environ. Sci. Technol. |volume=40 |issue=18 |pages=5629–35 |date=September 2006 |pmid=17007119 |doi= 10.1021/es060134y|url= |pmc=2757450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These pollutants may pose additional health and environmental problems when they enter human and animal diets.

====Species endangerment====
The demands for aromatic materials such as sandalwood, agarwood, and musk have led to the endangerment of these species, as well as illegal trafficking and harvesting.

===Safety regulations===
The perfume industry in the US is not directly regulated by the FDA, instead the FDA controls the safety of perfumes through their ingredients and requires that they be tested to the extent that they are ''[[Generally recognized as safe]]'' (GRAS). Due to the need for protection of trade secrets, companies rarely give the full listing of ingredients regardless of their effects on health. In Europe, as from 11 March 2005, the mandatory listing of a set of 26 recognized fragrance allergens was enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:066:0026:0035:EN:PDF|title="DIRECTIVE 2003/15/EC"|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement to list these materials is dependent on the intended use of the final product. The limits above which the allegens are required to be declared are 0.001% for products intended to remain on the skin, and 0.01% for those intended to be rinsed off. This has resulted in many old perfumes like chypres and [[fougère]] classes, which require the use of oakmoss extract, being reformulated.

==Preserving perfume==
[[File:Dokumentation av utställningen Passion för parfym, 2007, Hallwylska museet - Hallwylska museet - 86456.tif|thumb|upright|Perfumes in a museum]]

Fragrance compounds in perfumes will degrade or break down if improperly stored in the presence of [[heat]], [[light]], [[oxygen]], and [[Dirt|extraneous organic materials]].
Proper preservation of perfumes involves keeping them away from sources of heat and storing them where they will not be exposed to light. An opened bottle will keep its aroma intact for several years, as long as it is well stored.&lt;ref name=Burr /&gt; However, the presence of oxygen in the head space of the bottle and environmental factors will in the long run alter the smell of the fragrance.

Perfumes are best preserved when kept in light-tight [[aluminium]] bottles or in their original packaging when not in use, and refrigerated to relatively low temperatures: between 3–7&amp;nbsp;°C (37–45&amp;nbsp;°F). Although it is difficult to completely remove oxygen from the headspace of a stored flask of fragrance, opting for spray dispensers instead of rollers and "open" bottles will minimize oxygen exposure. Sprays also have the advantage of isolating fragrance inside a bottle and preventing it from mixing with dust, skin, and detritus, which would degrade and alter the quality of a perfume.

There exist several [[archives]] and [[museums]] devoted to the preservation of historical perfumes, namely the [[Osmothèque]], which stocks over 3,000 perfumes from the past two millennia in their original formulations. All scents in their collection are preserved in non-[[actinic]] glass flasks flushed with [[argon]] gas, stored in [[Thermal insulation|thermally insulated]] compartments maintained at {{convert|12|°C|°F|1}} in a large vault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beautyfashion.com/archives/LOsmotheque.html Colton, Sarah, "L’Osmothèque—Preserving The Past To Ensure The Future", Beauty Fashion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615174831/http://www.beautyfashion.com/archives/LOsmotheque.html |date=15 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Pan''' is a fictional character created by [[List of Scottish novelists|Scottish novelist]] and playwright [[J. M. Barrie]]. A free-spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and [[Puer aeternus|never grows up]], Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of [[Neverland]] as the leader of the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]], interacting with [[Fairy|fairies]], [[Piracy|pirate]]s, [[mermaid]]s, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.

Peter Pan has become a [[cultural icon]] symbolizing youthful innocence and escapism. In addition to two distinct works by Barrie, the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include a 1953 animated film, a 2003 dramatic/live-action film, a television series and many other works.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Origin==
[[File:Peter Pan, by Oliver Herford, 1907.png|thumb|170px|1907 illustration of Peter Pan by [[Oliver Herford]] ]]
[[File:Peter Pan 1915 cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cover of 1915 edition of [[J. M. Barrie]]'s novel, first published in 1911, illustrated by [[Francis Donkin Bedford|F. D. Bedford]]&lt;ref&gt;Francis Donkin Bedford died in 1954 and his works are in copyright until 2024 in Europe. If this work is not "work for hire" then it is fair use.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[J. M. Barrie]] first used Peter Pan as a character in a section of ''[[The Little White Bird]]'' (1902), an adult novel where he appears as a seven-day-old baby in the chapter entitled ''Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens''. Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers, Hodder and Stoughton, extracted chapters 13–18 of ''The Little White Bird'' and republished them in 1906 under the title ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'', with the addition of illustrations by [[Arthur Rackham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=J.M. Barrie &amp; the Lost Boys |last=Birkin |first=Andrew |year=2003|publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=0-300-09822-7|page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to the character of Peter Pan as the centre of his [[stage play]] entitled ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]],'' which premiered on 27 December 1904 in London. Barrie later adapted and expanded the play's story line as a [[novel]], published in 1911 as ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''.

==Physical appearance==
Barrie never described Peter's appearance in detail, even in his novel, leaving it to the imagination of the reader and the interpretation of anyone adapting the character. In the play, Peter's outfit is made of autumn leaves and cobwebs.&lt;ref&gt;Barrie, J.M. ''Peter Pan'' (play). Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1928, Act I, Scene 1&lt;/ref&gt; His name and playing the [[Pan flute|flute or pipes]] suggest the mythological character [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. Barrie mentions in ''Peter and Wendy'' that Peter Pan still had all his "first teeth".&lt;ref name="chap1"&gt;Barrie, J M. ''Peter and Wendy''. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1911, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; He describes him as a beautiful boy with a beautiful smile, "clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that flow from trees".&lt;ref name="chap1"/&gt;

Traditionally, the character has been played on stage by a petite adult woman.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce K. Hanson. ''Peter Pan on Stage and Screen 1904–2010''. McFarland, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the original productions in the UK, Peter Pan's costume was a reddish tunic and dark green tights, such as that worn by [[Nina Boucicault]] in 1904. This costume is exhibited in Barrie's Birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nts.org.uk/Property/J-M-Barries-Birthplace/ |title=J M Barrie's Birthplace |publisher=Nts.org.uk |date= |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similar costume worn by [[Pauline Chase]] (who played the role from 1906 to 1913) is displayed in the [[Museum of London]]. Early editions of adaptations of the story also depict a red costume&lt;ref&gt;Daniel O'Connor, illustrated by Alice B. Woodward. ''The Peter Pan Picture Book''. Bell &amp; Sons, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Peter Pan's ABC'' illustrated by Flora White. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; but a green costume (whether or not made of leaves) becomes more usual from the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;May Byron illustrated by Mabel Lucie Atwell, ''Peter Pan and Wendy''. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1921&lt;/ref&gt; and more so later after the release of Disney's animated movie.

In the Disney films, Peter wears an outfit that consists of a short-sleeved green tunic and tights apparently made of cloth, and a cap with a red feather in it. He has pointed [[elf]]-like ears, brown eyes and his hair is red. In ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991), the character is played as an adult by [[Robin Williams]], with blue eyes and dark brown hair; in flashbacks to him in his youth, his hair is light brown. In this film his ears appear pointed only when he is Peter Pan, not as Peter Banning.&lt;!--The name is not "Panning"; please read the film credits--&gt; His Pan attire resembles the Disney outfit (minus the cap). In the live-action [[Peter Pan (2003 film)|2003 ''Peter Pan'' film]], he is portrayed by [[Jeremy Sumpter]], who has blond hair and blue-green eyes. His outfit is made of leaves and vines.

==Age==
[[File:Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens in the City of Westminster in London, spring 2013 (12).JPG|thumb|right|Statue of Peter Pan in [[Kensington Gardens]], [[London]], England]]

J.M. Barrie created his character based on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.&lt;ref&gt;Birkin, Andrew. ''J.M. Barrie and the Lost Boys.'' Yale University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The "boy who wouldn't grow up" character has been described as a variety of ages.
* In ''[[The Little White Bird]]'' (1902) and ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'' (1906), he was only seven days old.
* Although his age is not stated in Barrie's [[Peter and Wendy|play]] (1904) or [[Peter and Wendy|novel]] (1911), the book says that he still had all his baby teeth. In other ways, the character appears to be older, about 12–13 years old.

==Personality==
Peter is an exaggerated stereotype of a boastful and careless boy. He claims greatness, even when such claims are questionable (such as congratulating himself when Wendy re-attaches his shadow). In the play and book, Peter symbolises the selfishness of childhood, and is portrayed as being forgetful and self-centred.

Peter has a nonchalant, devil-may-care attitude, and is fearlessly cocky when it comes to putting himself in danger. Barrie writes that when Peter thought he was going to die on Marooners' Rock, he felt scared, yet he felt only one shudder. With this blithe attitude, he says, "To die will be an awfully big adventure". In the play, the unseen and unnamed narrator ponders what might have been if Peter had stayed with Wendy, so that his cry might have become, "To live would be an awfully big adventure!", "but he can never quite get the hang of it".&lt;ref&gt;Barrie, J M. ''Peter Pan''. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1928, Act V, Scene 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abilities==
Peter's archetypal quality is his unending youth. In ''Peter and Wendy'', it is explained that Peter must forget his own adventures and what he learns about the world in order to stay childlike.

Peter's ability to fly is explained, but inconsistently. In ''The Little White Bird'', he is able to fly because he is said to be part bird, like all babies. In the play and novel, he teaches the Darling children to fly using a combination of "lovely wonderful thoughts" and fairy dust. In Barrie's Dedication to the play ''Peter Pan, The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow up'',&lt;ref&gt;Barrie, J M. ''Peter Pan''. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1928, To the Five - A Dedication&lt;/ref&gt; the author attributes the idea of fairy dust being necessary for flight to practical needs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...after the first production I had to add something to the play at the request of parents (who thus showed that they thought me the responsible person) about no one being able to fly until the fairy dust had been blown on him; so many children having gone home and tried it from their beds and needed surgical attention. &lt;small&gt; - J.M. Barrie&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peter has an effect on the whole of Neverland and its inhabitants when he is there. Barrie states that although Neverland appears different to every child, the island "wakes up" when Peter returns from his trip to London. In the chapter "The Mermaids' Lagoon" in the book ''Peter and Wendy'', Barrie writes that there is almost nothing that Peter cannot do. He is a skilled [[swordsman]], rivalling even Captain Hook, whose hand he cut off in a duel. He has remarkably keen vision and hearing. He is skilled in mimicry, copying the voice of Hook and the ticking of the clock in the crocodile.

Peter has the ability to imagine things into existence and he is able to feel danger when it is near.

In ''Peter and Wendy'', Barrie states that the Peter Pan legend Mrs Darling heard as a child was that when children died, he accompanied them part of the way to their destination so they would not be frightened. This is a role similar to the Greek god [[Hermes]] as a [[psychopomp]].

In the original play, Peter states that no one must ever touch him (though he does not know why). The stage directions specify that no one does so throughout the play. Wendy approaches Peter to give him a "kiss" (thimble), but is prevented by [[Tinker Bell]]. However, [[John Caird (director)|John Caird]] and [[Trevor Nunn|Trevor Nunn's]] introduction to the script for the 1997 [[Royal National Theatre]] production, states that this was never Barrie's original intention, and was only added for a production in 1927, where [[Jean Forbes-Robertson]] took the title role, and played the part with a lighter, more fairy-like, physicality&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Peter-Pan-Would-Fantasy-Modern/dp/0413735508/&lt;/ref&gt;. Robertson was to play the part almost every year until 1939.

== Cultural allusions ==
The character's name comes from two sources: [[Peter Llewelyn Davies]], one of the five Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired the story, and [[Pan (god)|Pan]], a minor deity of Greek mythology who plays [[pan flute|pipes]] to [[nymphs]] and is part human and part goat. This is referenced in Barrie's works (particularly ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'') where Peter Pan plays pipes to the fairies and rides a goat. The god Pan represents Nature or Man's natural state in contrast to Civilisation and the effects of upbringing on human behaviour. Peter Pan is a free spirit, being too young to be burdened with the effects of education or to have an adult appreciation of moral responsibility. As a 'betwixt-and-between', who can fly and speak the language of fairies and birds, Peter is part animal and part human. According to  psychologist [[Rosalind Ridley]], by comparing Peter's behaviour to adults and to other animals, Barrie raises many post-Darwinian questions about the origins of human nature and behaviour. As 'the boy who wouldn't grow up', Peter exhibits many aspects of the stages of cognitive development seen in children and can be regarded as Barrie's memory of himself as a child, being both charmingly childlike and childishly solipsistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peter Pan and the Mind of J. M. Barrie.|last=Ridley|first=Rosalind|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4438-9107-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==
{{Main|Characters of Peter Pan}}
[[File:Bruxelles Parc d'Egmont 803.jpg|thumb|right|Statue in [[Brussels]], Belgium]]

===Family===
Peter Pan ran away from his parents when he was a baby as told in ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'' and ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''. Finding the window closed and seeing a new baby in the house when he returned some time later, he believed his parents no longer wanted him and never came back. This younger sibling is referred to in the chapter "Lock-Out Time" in ''Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens'' but is not mentioned again.

===Friends===

====Maimie Mannering====
While in Kensington Gardens, Peter meets a lost girl named Maimie Mannering and the two quickly become friends. Peter proposes marriage to Maimie. While Maimie wants to stay in the Gardens with Peter, she comes to realise that her mother is so worried that she must return to her. Maimie promises to always remember Peter and goes back to her mother. When Maimie grows up, she continues to think of Peter, dedicating presents and letters to him. To remember Maimie, Peter rides the imaginary goat that Maimie created for him. She is considered to be the literary predecessor of [[Wendy Darling]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Jacqueline. ''The Case of Peter Pan, Or, The Impossibility of Children's Fiction,'' University of Pennsylvania Press, 1984, Pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Darlings====

=====Wendy Darling=====
{{Main|Wendy Darling}}
Wendy is hinted to have romantic feelings for Peter, but cannot be with him because of his inability to love back. In the 2003 film ''[[Peter Pan (2003 film)|Peter Pan]],'' the feeling is mutual. Captain Hook can only take away Peter's ability to fly by thoughts of Wendy leaving him, growing up, and replacing him with a husband. Wendy saves Peter by giving him her hidden kiss (signifying he is her true love); this gives him the will to live. In the movie ''[[Hook (movie)|Hook]],'' an older Wendy implies that she used to (and perhaps, still does) have feelings for Peter, saying that she was shocked that he did not prevent her wedding day. In the sequel to the 1953 Disney film, ''[[Return to Neverland]],'' Peter and a grown-up Wendy are briefly, but happily, reunited after many years and continue to show feelings for each other.

In the original novel, Peter later befriends Wendy's daughter Jane (and her subsequent daughter Margaret), and it is implied that this pattern will go on forever. From time to time Peter visits the real world, and befriends children. Wendy Darling, whom he recruited to be his "mother", is the most significant of them; he also brings her brothers [[John Darling (Peter Pan)|John]] and [[Michael Darling (Peter Pan)|Michael]] to Neverland at her request. It is mentioned that Wendy was the only girl who captured his attention.

=====John Darling and Michael Darling=====

John, the older brother of the Darlings, proves to be extremely mature for his age. He becomes fascinated with piracy and imitates Captain Hook while playing at home with his siblings. Not only sophisticated, John is also courageous and smart. Peter typically tasks John with the responsibility of directing the Lost Boys when Peter is absent. Michael, the youngest of the Darlings, is convinced that Peter Pan is a real person after hearing Wendy's passionate narratives about him. During nursery games, it's Michael who plays the role of Peter Pan whom he looks up to.

=====Mary and George Darling=====

The parents of Wendy, John and Michael. Mr Darling works as a clerk in the [[City of London|City]], and is named after George Llewelyn Davies. Mrs Darling is named after Mary Ansell, Barrie's wife.

====Neverland inhabitants====

=====Tiger Lily=====
Tiger Lily is the daughter of Great Big Little Panther, the chief of the Piccaninny [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe resident in Neverland. Barrie refers to her as "a princess in her own right", and she is often described as such. She is kidnapped by the pirates and left to die on Marooners' Rock, but is rescued by Peter. It is hinted later that she may have romantic feelings for Peter but he does not return them, as he is completely oblivious of other people's feelings. In the Disney film, Tiger Lily shows her gratitude by performing a dance for Peter and kissing him. The kiss makes him turn bright red, and makes Wendy jealous of Tiger Lily.

=====Tinker Bell=====
{{Main|Tinker Bell}}
Tinker Bell is a common fairy who is Peter Pan's best friend and often jealously protective of him. She is the friend who helps him in his escapades. As his fairy, Tink’s malicious actions are usually caused by her jealousy which leads to the Lost Boys shooting arrows at Wendy (or nearly stoning her to death in the Disney film), and eventually even reveals Peter’s hideout to Captain Hook, thinking that Wendy will be captured rather than Peter. When Tink realises her serious mistake, she risks her own life by drinking the poison Hook has left for Peter (or pushing Hook’s bomb away in Disney's movie). Her extreme loyalty and dedication to Peter is everlasting.

=====The Lost Boys=====
{{Main|Lost Boys (Peter Pan)}}
Peter is the leader of the Lost Boys, which include Tootles, Nibs, Slightly, Curly, and The Twins. The Lost Boys is a band of boys who were lost by their parents after they "fall out of their perambulators" and came to live in Neverland. In Barrie's novel ''Peter and Wendy'' (but not the original play ''Peter Pan''), it is stated that Peter "thins them out" when they start to grow up. This is never fully explained, but it is implied that he either kills them or banishes them. 

In the song "I Won't Grow Up" from [[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|the 1954 musical]], the boys sing "I will stay a boy forever" to which Peter replies "and be banished if I don't". 

In [[Peter Pan in Scarlet]] (2006), the official sequel to Barrie's ''Peter and Wendy'', what happens to the Lost Boys when they begin to grow up is revealed when Slightly starts to grow older, as Peter banishes him to Nowhereland (Which basically means that he and all his allies will ignore the banished person's existence), the home of all the Long Lost Boys whom Peter has banished in times past.

=====The Crocodile=====
The crocodile (Tick-Tock in the Disney film) is Captain Hook's nemesis. After Peter Pan cut off Captain Hook's hand in a fight and threw it into the sea, the crocodile swallowed it and got a taste for Hook. It also swallowed a ticking clock, which alerts Hook of its presence.

===Adversaries===

====Captain Hook====
{{Main|Captain Hook}}
Captain Hook, whose right hand was cut off in a duel, is Peter Pan's arch-enemy. Hook's crew, including [[Smee]] and Starkey, also consider him a foe. Captain Hook's two principal fears are [[Blood phobia|the sight of his own blood]] (which is supposedly an unnatural colour) and one crocodile. His name plays on the [[Transradial prosthesis|iron hook]] that replaced his hand cut off by Peter Pan and eaten by a [[saltwater crocodile]], which continues to pursue Hook.

In the [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|1953 animated film]], Hook seeks revenge on Peter Pan for having fed the crocodile his hand, and refuses to leave [[Neverland]] without satisfaction.&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web|work=Disney Archives|title=Captain Hook: Character History|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/villains/hook/hook.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hook is supported by Mr. Smee. After promising Tinker Bell 'not to lay a finger (or a hook) on Peter Pan', he lays a bomb in Peter's hideout. At the conclusion of the film, Hook is chased by the crocodile into the distance. [[Walt Disney]] insisted on keeping Hook alive, as he said: "The audience will get to liking Hook, and they don't want to see him killed."&lt;ref name=villains&gt;Thomas, Frank &amp; Johnston, Ollie (1993) ''Disney Villain'' "Chapter 4: Nine Old Men," section: "Peter Pan", pages 109-113. {{ISBN|978 1562827922}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sequel ''[[Return to Never Land]]'', Hook mistakes Wendy's daughter Jane for Wendy, and uses her as bait to lure Peter Pan to his death.

====Mr. Smee====
{{main|Mr. Smee}}
Mr. Smee is [[Captain Hook]]'s [[boatswain]] ("bo'sun") and right-hand man in [[J. M. Barrie]]'s play ''Peter Pan'' and the novel ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''. Mr. Smee is Captain Hook’s direct confidant. Unlike the other pirates, Smee is often clumsy and incapable of capturing any of the Lost Boys. Rather than engaging in Hook’s evil schemes, Smee finds excitement in bagging loot and treasures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6523">The '''Peugeot Concours Design''' competition was a [[wiktionary:Biennial|biennial]] competition run by the French [[car]] manufacturer [[Peugeot]]. For each [[competition]], entrants had to submit their designs for a car. A model of the winning design was built by the Peugeot Styling Centre and unveiled at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. The last competition took place in 2008.

==History==
The first contest took place in 2000-2001, with the theme "2020" - a challenge to design a [[Peugeot]] car for the year 2020. The contest was announced at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in 2000, and culminated in the winning design being built by Peugeot, and unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2001.  Since then, the contest has followed a similar schedule every two years. For the 2006-2007 contest, the winning design featured in an [[Xbox 360]] game.

==Themes==
Each contest has a theme, which contestants must follow when creating their designs:
*2000-2001 "2020" - a concept car for the year 2020&lt;ref name="2000 CDN article"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.cardesignnews.com/news/2001/010327peugeot-contest/index.html|title=Peugeot '2020' Design Contest winner announced|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
The contest runs to a similar schedule, with similar rules, each year. In 2008, the contest opened in June, with the deadline for submissions on July 20. When the deadline for submissions has passed, Peugeot selects 30 entries to go forward to the next stage. These 30 entries are placed on the competition's website and are voted on by visitors to the site and selected industry and press figures. Based on these votes, these 30 entries are narrowed down to ten entries and these entries are posted to the website. This stage is not a majority vote - the ten entries which are selected may not be the highest-voted entries.

In the final stage of voting, the Peugeot Jury select the winner and 2nd and 3rd runners-up from the final ten. The results of this are then posted to the competition's website, usually some time in February.

==Winners==
===2000-2001===
The winner of the 2000-2001 competition was ''Moonster'' by Marko Lukovic. The concept behind this design was that the vehicle should be totally original. It features a wheel-level engine with a raised central compartment capable of seating two people.&lt;ref name="2001 winner article"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.cardesignnews.com/news/2001/010327peugeot-contest/index.html|title='2020' Design Contest winnder announced - car design news|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===2002-2003===
This contest, themed "Retrofuturism", was won by Stefan Schulze with ''4002''. With this design, the artist intended to make the car look like a typical Peugeot. Many commentators felt that he was successful with this, citing the design of the headlights as particularly Peugeot-like.&lt;ref name="2003 winner article"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1722/Peugeot-4002.html|title=Peugeot 4002 - ultimatecarpage.com|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===2004-2005===
This contest was won by André Costa with ''Moovie''. His was an unusual design, almost totally enclosed by dark glass with few visible external features. The creator has stated that the car was designed to be environmentally friendly and ideal for use in cities.&lt;ref name="2005 winner"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peugeot-concours-design.com/en/01_vainqueur/|title=''Moovie'' by Andre Costa|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006-2007 competition was won by Mihai Panaitescu with his design, ''Flux''. According to its creator, the car is intended to be sporty and versatile, and able to handle many different environments with ease. ''Flux'' is meant to symbolise "the continuous change and flow of our daily lives during work and play" - to this end, the car contains an integrated Xbox 360 console.&lt;ref name="2007 winner"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peugeot-concours-design.com/en/10vainqueurs/grandvainqueur/|title=''Flux'' by Mihai Panaitescu|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5702">'''Plastic arts''' are [[art form]]s which involve physical manipulation of a plastic medium by [[Molding (process)|molding]] or modeling such as [[sculpture]] or [[ceramic art|ceramics]]. 

Less often, and less usefully, the term may be used broadly for all the [[visual arts]] (such as painting, sculpture, film and photography), as opposed to literature and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plastic%20arts |title=Merriam-Webster Online (entry for "plastic arts") |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials for use in the plastic arts, in the narrower definition, include those that can be carved or shaped, such as stone or wood, [[concrete]], glass, or [[metal]].

The term "[[plastic]]" has been used to mean certain synthetic organic resins ever since they were invented, but the term "plastic arts" long preceded them. 

The term should not be confused, either, with [[Piet Mondrian]]'s concept of "[[Neoplasticism]]".

=='Plastic' and the philosophy of art==
In contrast to the limiting of 'plastic arts' to sculpture and architecture by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] in 1807,&lt;ref&gt;Russian Romantic Criticism: An Anthology, edited by Lauren Gray Leighton, Published by Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987,  {{ISBN|0313255849}}, {{ISBN|978-0313255847}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German critic [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] (1767-1845) applied the concept not only to visual arts, but also poetry. 

Classical poetry lines he saw utilizing plastic isolation, and rhyme falling under the Romantic (domain). &lt;ref&gt;''The literary theories of August Wilhelm Schlegel'' by Ralph W. Ewton jnr, Published by Walter de Gruyter and Co (1972), {{ISBN|3110991632}}, {{ISBN|978-3110991635}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

In Schlegel's Viennese lectures (1809-1811), published in 1827 as ''On the Theory and History of the Plastic Arts'', he contrasted the plasticism of Classical Art with picturesque Romanticism. He {{quotation|"operated with the antinomy of terms plastic/pictorial, mechanically/ organically, finite/ infinite, and closed/accomplished. Schlegel stated that the spirit of the entire antique culture and poetry was plastic and that the spirit of modern culture, however, was picturesque (pittoresk)".|&lt;ref&gt;''Civic Art Then and Now: The Culture of Good Place-making'' by Charles C. Bohl, in Sitte, Hegemann and the Metropolis: Modern Civic Art and International Exchanges, edited by Charles Bohl and Jean-François Lejeune, Published by Routledge, 2009, {{ISBN|0415424070}}, {{ISBN|978-0415424073}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  These distinctions were carried over into Russian Romanticism aesthetics, {{quotation|"[[Dmitry Venevitinov|Venevitinov]] objected to the indiscriminate use of the term 'pictures'. 

In his use of August Schlegel's term 'plastic' (''plastisch'', ''plastika'') he argues for a return to the simple, primitive, enclosed, defined, limited, finite, corporeal, and plastic world of the ancients. There seem to have been two interpretations of the plastic - picturesque contrast (antitheses) in Romantic Idealist philosophy.  As Venevitinov uses the contrast, and as August Schlegel intended it to be used when he defined it in Lecture I of ''Vorlesungen über dramatische Kunst und Literatur'', it denoted the difference between the corporeal mind of the man of antiquity and the 'picturesque' mind of modern man.  Ancient art appeals directly to the senses, modern art gives rise to mental pictures or images. The former is therefore real and corporeal, the latter ideal."|&lt;ref&gt;Russian Romantic Criticism: An Anthology, edited by Lauren Gray Leighton, Published by Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987,  {{ISBN|0313255849}}, {{ISBN|978-0313255847}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Portrait of Charlotte du Val d'Ognes''''' is an 1801 painting ([[portrait painting]]) by [[Marie-Denise Villers]]. It is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Portrait of Charlotte du Val d'Ognes|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437903|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was first acquired by the museum in 1922 and attributed to [[Jacques-Louis David|Jacques Louis David]]. Later, the painting was attributed to [[Constance Marie Charpentier]] and finally to Villers.

==Early history and creation==
Because the painting is unsigned, it has been attributed incorrectly over time.{{Sfn|Greer|2001|p=142}} It was first exhibited at the 1801 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]], during the year that [[Jacques-Louis David|Jacques Louis David]] boycotted the exhibition.{{Sfn|Greer|2001|p=142}} A member of the Val d'Ognes family believed it had been painted by David.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Later history and display==
The Met bought the painting, attributed to David, for two hundred thousand dollars in 1922.{{Sfn|Greer|2001|p=142}} In 1951, [[Charles Sterling]] of the Met admitted that the painting may not have been David's.{{Sfn|Greer|2001|p=142}} Sterling was first tipped off that the painting was not David's because the artist had boycotted the 1801 Salon.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The mistake was published in the Met's January 1951 ''Bulletin''.{{Sfn|Quinn|2017|p=56}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sterling|first=Charles|date=1951|title=A Fine "David" Reattributed|jstor=3257483|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|volume=9|issue=5|pages=121–132|doi=10.2307/3257483|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting may have been [[Constance Marie Charpentier|Constance Marie Charpentier's]] because of some evidence found in Salon entries seem to indicate it was hers, however David's name did not come off of the frame until 1977.{{Sfn|Greer|2001|p=142}} Sterling's reattribution of the painting to Charpentier was also based on analysis of her painting, ''Melancholy'' (1801).{{Sfn|Mainz|2001|p=247}}

Later, in 1996, Margaret Oppenheimer realized that the painting should instead be attributed to Marie Denise Villers.{{Sfn|Quinn|2017|p=56}}&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Oppenheimer's reattribution is based on a [[modello]] by Villers, ''A Young Woman Seated by a Window''.{{Sfn|Quinn|2017|p=57}}

The painting is currently on view at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in Gallery 613.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Description and interpretation==
The work depicts a [[woman]] drawing in front of a broken window. Behind the woman, a couple stand on a [[parapet]].{{Sfn|Greer|2001|p=142}} In the ''Concise Dictionary of Women Artists'' (2001), Valerie Mainz describes the broken window as a "''tour de force'' of the painter's art distinguishing, in its ''[[Trompe-l'œil|trompe-l'oeil]]'' effect, the view of the scene outside as to be seen as only partly through glass."{{Sfn|Mainz|2001|p=247}} The room depicted in the painting is actually a gallery of the [[Louvre]], as discovered by art historian, Ann Higonnet.{{Sfn|Quinn|2017|p=58}}{{Sfn|James|1997|p=xiii}}

Early description, when it was presumed to be David's assumed that the woman in the painting was his student, drawing him as he painted her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=26 September 1938|title=Jacques Louis David (1748-1825)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f00EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=%22charlotte%20du%20val%20d'ognes%22&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q=%22charlotte%20du%20val%20d'ognes%22&amp;f=false|journal=LIFE|volume=5|issue=13|pages=38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Maurois|Andre Maurois]] said that it was "a perfect picture, unforgettable."{{Sfn|Greer|2001|p=142}} Critical response to the work prior to attributing the work to Charpentier was often positive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6GSMUGGEmgC&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=%22charlotte%20du%20val%20d'ognes%22&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q=%22charlotte%20du%20val%20d'ognes%22&amp;f=false|title=Aesthetics in Feminist Perspective|last=Lauter|first=Estella|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1993|isbn=9780253114884|editor-last=Hein|editor-first=Hilde|location=Bloomington, Indiana|pages=23|chapter=Re-enfranchising Art: Feminist Interventions in the Theory of Art|ref=harv|editor-last2=Korsmeyer|editor-first2=Carolyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Parker|Pollock|2013|p=106}}

After Sterling admitted the picture may not be David's, he called it a "merciless portrait of an intelligent, homely woman."{{Sfn|Greer|2001|p=142}} He also felt that the anatomy of the portrait was incorrect.{{Sfn|Mainz|2001|p=247}} Other critics suddenly found faults in the portrait, now that it was no longer considered a David and ascribed to Charpentier instead.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Sfn|James|1997|p=xiii}} [[James Laver]] wrote of the painting in 1964, "Although the painting is extremely attractive as a period piece, there are certain weaknesses of which a painter of David's calibre would not have been guilty."{{Sfn|Parker|Pollock|2013|p=106}}

In a more modern take, [[Germaine Greer]] wrote that the picture "does not seek to charm, nor does it seek to portray the sexual vitality of its sitter" and felt that it was a [[Feminism|feminist]] painting in nature.{{Sfn|Greer|2001|p=142}} Other feminist critics began to ascribe a [[Femininity|feminine]] aspect to the painting.{{Sfn|James|1997|p=xiv}}

The Louvre gallery discovered by Higonnet in 2014 was used by women to teach and be instructed in art.{{Sfn|Quinn|2017|p=58}} Higonnet therefore believes the painting is a portrait of a woman by a woman.{{Sfn|Quinn|2017|p=58}} The named woman, Charlotte du Val d'Ognes, once wanted to be a professional artist, but chose instead to give up art when she was married.{{Sfn|Quinn|2017|p=58}} Bridget Quinn describes the painting as a moment where "two young women longing to make art found themselves in a brief period of opportunity, when instruction, exhibition and even fame were possible."{{Sfn|Quinn|2017|p=59}}

[[File:RichardD'OylyCarte.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Richard D'Oyly Carte]]
'''Richard D'Oyly Carte''' (3 May 1844 – 3 April 1901) was an English talent agent, theatrical [[impresario]], composer and hotelier during the latter half of the [[Victorian era]]. Rising from humble beginnings, Carte built two of London's theatres and a hotel empire, while also establishing an opera company that ran continuously for over a hundred years and a management agency representing some of the most important artists of the day.

Carte started his career working for his father, [[Richard Carte]], in the music publishing and musical instrument manufacturing business. As a young man, he conducted and composed music, but he soon turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency. Carte believed that a school of wholesome, well-crafted, family-friendly, English [[comic opera]] could be as popular as the risqué French works dominating the London musical stage in the 1870s. To that end, he brought together the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] and composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] and, together with his wife [[Helen Carte]], he nurtured their collaboration on a series of thirteen [[Savoy opera]]s. He founded the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] and built the state-of-the-art [[Savoy Theatre]] to host the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas.

Carte also built the [[Savoy Hotel]] in London, and acquired other luxury hotels. In addition, he erected the [[Palace Theatre, London]], which he had intended to be the home of a new school of English [[grand opera]], although this ambition was not realised beyond the production of a single grand opera by Sullivan, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]''. Nevertheless, his partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, and his careful management of their operas and relationship, created a series of works whose success was unprecedented in the history of musical theatre. His opera company, later operated by Helen and then by his son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], and granddaughter, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte|Bridget]], promoted those works for over a century, and they are still performed regularly today.

==Early life==
[[File:Richard-carte.jpg|thumb|left|Carte's father, Richard]]
Carte was born in [[Greek Street]] in the [[West End of London]] on 3 May 1844.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He was the eldest of six children. His father, [[Richard Carte]] (originally Cart; 1808–1891), was a [[flautist]], and his mother was the former Eliza Jones (1814–1885); they had eloped, to the disappointment of her father, Thomas Jones, a clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;Young, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; His siblings were Blanch (1846–1935), Viola (1848–1925), Rose (b. 1854), Henry (1856–1926) and Eliza (1860–1941). Carte was of Welsh and [[Normans|Norman]] ancestry; D'Oyly is a Norman French name which "was a forename (not part of a double surname)".&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32311, "Carte, Richard D'Oyly (1844–1901)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The name comes from his mother's grandmother, Elizabeth D'Oyly, who was a descendant of Peregrine D'Oyly of Overbury Hall in [[Layham]], Suffolk (c. 1625–1667).&lt;/ref&gt; To supplement his income as a performer, Carte's father joined the firm of Rudall, Rose &amp; Co., musical instrument makers and music publishers, in 1850.&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;Burgess, Michael. "Richard D'Oyly Carte", ''The Savoyard'', January 1975, pp. 7–11&lt;/ref&gt; After he became a partner in the business, it changed its name to Rudall, Rose, Carte and Co. and later to Rudall, Carte &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;"New Music", ''The Era'', 21 March 1869. Rudall, Carte and Co was still trading in the West End in 1954: see ''The Times'', 16 December 1954, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte was brought up in [[Dartmouth Park]] Road.&lt;ref name=Ainger75&gt;Ainger, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Rob.

''The Independent'', 13 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His cultured mother exposed her family to art, music and poetry, and young Carte studied the violin and then the flute at an early age.&lt;ref name=Joseph8&gt;Joseph, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The family spoke French at home two days a week, and his parents often took their children to the theatre.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; He was educated at [[University College School]], which he left in 1860. In 1861, he achieved First Class level in the matriculation examination&lt;ref&gt;"University Intelligence", ''The Daily News'', 1 February 1861&lt;/ref&gt; and then attended [[University College London|University College]], London. However, he left later that year to work in his father's business, along with his brother, Henry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/A2A/records.aspx?cat=074-acc0727&amp;cid=-1&amp;Gsm=2008-06-18#-1 Rivington and Son (Solicitors)], London Metropolitan Archives, National Archives, accessed 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He studied music during this time and composed some pieces, which he dedicated to the actress [[Kate Terry]].&lt;ref name=whowaswho&gt;Stone, David.

==Career==
Between 1868 and 1877, Carte wrote and published the music for a number of his own songs and instrumental works, as well as several comic operas: ''Doctor Ambrosias – His Secret'', at [[St. George's Hall, London|St. George's Hall]] (1868);&lt;ref&gt;"Music and Musicians", ''The Daily News'', 12 April 1895&lt;/ref&gt; ''Marie'', with librettist E. Spencer Mott, at London's [[Opera Comique]] in 1871;&lt;ref name=Ainger92&gt;Ainger, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Original Correspondence", ''The Era'', 10 September 1871&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Happy Hampstead'', with librettist [[Frank Desprez]], which debuted on an 1876 provincial tour and then played at the [[Royalty Theatre]] in 1877.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; On tour in 1871, Carte conducted ''[[Cox and Box]]'' by composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] and dramatist [[F. C. Burnand]], in tandem with English adaptations of two Offenbach pieces, called ''Rose of Auvergne'' and ''Breaking the Spell'', in which Carte's client [[Selina Dolaro]] appeared.&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 5 September 1871, p. 1. The composer's brother, [[Fred Sullivan]], managed the tour and played Cox, while [[Richard Temple (opera singer)|Richard Temple]] played Bouncer, in ''Cox and Box''.&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's musical talent would be helpful later in his career, as he was able to audition singers himself from the pianoforte.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1860s and early 1870s, from within his father's firm in Charing Cross&lt;ref&gt;Classified ad in ''The Era'', 20 November 1870, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and, by late 1874, from a nearby address in Craig's Court,&lt;ref&gt;Classified ad in ''The Era'', 27 December 1874, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Carte began to build an operatic, concert and lecture management agency.&lt;ref name=Joseph8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ainger92/&gt; His two hundred clients eventually included [[Charles Gounod]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Adelina Patti]], [[Giovanni Matteo Mario|Mario]], [[Clara Schumann]], [[Antoinette Sterling]], [[Edward Lloyd (singer)|Edward Lloyd]], [[Thomas German Reed|Mr. and Mrs. German Reed]], [[George Grossmith]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hesketh Pearson]] said of Carte: "His acute business sense was aided by a frank and agreeable manner.... He took what other people thought were risks, but he felt were certainties. He knew everyone worth knowing... and his practical judgement was as sure as his sense of artistry."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, ''quoted'' in Burgess, Michael. "Richard D'Oyly Carte", ''The Savoyard'', January 1975, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding his opera company===
[[File:Trial by Jury cover.jpg|right|thumb|Programme for ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', 1875]]
In 1874, Carte leased the [[Opera Comique]], a theatre off [[Strand, London|the Strand]], where he presented [[Charles Lecocq]]'s new [[opéra bouffe]] ''[[Giroflé-Girofla]]'', given in French by the company who had premiered the work three months earlier in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;"Opera Comique", ''The Era'', 7 June 1874, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  He followed this with ''The Broken Branch'', an English adaptation of [[Gaston Serpette]]'s ''La branche cassée''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Carte announced his ambitions on the front of the programme for the latter: "It is my desire to establish in London a permanent abode for light Opera."&lt;ref&gt;"Our Representative Man", ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 10 October 1874, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' reported, "Mr D'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager, but a trained musician, and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine opera bouffe, and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment of a higher order, such as a musician might produce with satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 23 August 1874, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte later said it was "the scheme of my life" to found a school of high-quality, family-friendly English comic opera,&lt;ref name="Joseph, p. 11"&gt;Joseph, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the [[wikt:bawdy|bawdy]] [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and adaptations of French operettas that dominated the London musical stage at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 108–09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 128–29&lt;/ref&gt; His experience in writing operettas, however, had convinced him that his own creative talents were inadequate for the task. He later wrote to the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]], "I envy your position but I could never attain it. If I could be an author like you I would certainly not be a manager. I am simply the tradesman who sells your works of art."&lt;ref name=Joseph27&gt;Joseph, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 1874 Carte did not yet have the resources to make his idea into reality, and after his season at the Opera Comique, he terminated his lease.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he arranged for his client, Offenbach, to collaborate with [[H. B. Farnie]] to write a new operetta on the theme of ''[[Dick Whittington and His Cat]]'', which played during the Christmas season at the [[Alhambra Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art and Literary Gossip", ''[[The Manchester Times]]'', 29 August 1874&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gänzl|Gänzl, Kurt]].

In 1875, Carte became the business manager of the [[Royalty Theatre]], under the direction of his client, the popular singing actress Madame [[Selina Dolaro]]. There he programmed Offenbach's ''[[La Périchole]]''. To fill out the evening (as long programmes were the fashion in Victorian theatre), he needed another piece. He remembered a libretto for a one-act [[comic opera]] that W. S. Gilbert had written and shown to him in 1873, called ''[[Trial by Jury]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Sullivan's popular 1867 opera, ''[[Cox and Box]]'', had been revived at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in 1874, and Carte had already asked him to write a piece for the Royalty. Carte knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'' in 1871, and he now suggested that Sullivan could write the music for ''Trial by Jury''.&lt;ref name=Ainger108&gt;Ainger, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, George. "Whose ''Zoo''; or, When Did the ''Trial'' Begin?", ''Nineteenth Century Theatre Research'', 12, December 1984, pp. 39–54&lt;/ref&gt; Because Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of increasing the quality and respectability of English musical theatre, and so broadening its audience through the promotion of well-crafted English light operas, Carte gave them wider authority as director and music director than was customary at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Vorder Bruegge, Andrew.

[[File:Helen Carte Parasol.jpg|left|thumb|[[Helen Carte]]]]
Carte managed the first tour of ''Trial by Jury'', which stopped at the Theatre Royal in [[Dublin]], Ireland, in September 1875. While there, he met a young Scottish actress, Susan Couper Black, who used the stage name [[Helen Lenoir]]. She became fascinated by his vision for establishing a company to promote English [[comic opera]]&lt;ref name="Ainger, p. 111"/&gt; and gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation as his secretary.&lt;ref name=Joseph134&gt;Joseph, pp. 134–35&lt;/ref&gt; Well-educated, with an organisational ability, business acumen, focus on detail and diplomatic skills that surpassed even Carte's, Lenoir gradually became intensely involved in all of his business affairs. Carte and Lenoir married in 1888, three years after the death of his first wife.&lt;ref name=helenDNB&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59169, "Carte, Helen (1852–1913)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/59169}} accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 111–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the initial production of ''Trial by Jury'', however, Carte continued to produce continental operetta, touring in the summer of 1876 with a repertoire consisting of English adaptations of French opera bouffe (Offenbach’s ''La Périchole'', and ''[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein]]'', Lecocq's ''[[La fille de Madame Angot]]'' and [[Léon Vasseur]]'s ''La Timbale d'argent''), paired with two one-act English after-pieces (''Happy Hampstead'' and ''Trial by Jury''). Carte acted as the musical director of this travelling company that included [[W.H. Denny]].&lt;ref name=whowaswho/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 4 July 1876, p. 6; ''The Freeman's Journal'' (Dublin), 28 July 1876, p. 1; and ''The Era'', 23 July 1876, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wachs, Kevin.

Encouraged by the success of ''Trial by Jury'', Carte made attempts in 1875–76 to raise money for either a revival of ''Thespis'' or a new piece.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 113 and 119&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he finally found four backers and formed the "Comedy Opera Company" to produce the future works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], along with the works of other British author/composer teams.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; This allowed Carte to lease the Opera Comique and to give Gilbert and Sullivan firm terms for a new opera.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 130–31&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Helen Lenoir had been promoted from Carte's secretary to his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; The first comic opera produced by the new company was Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' in 1877, with a plot involving a tradesmanlike London magician and his patented love potion. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte were able to select their own cast, instead of using the players under contract to the theatre where the work was produced, as had been the case with their earlier works. They chose talented actors, few of whom were well-known stars, and Carte's agency provided many of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 111; Ainger, pp. 133–34&lt;/ref&gt; The reception of the piece showed that Carte had been right: there was a promising future in family-friendly English comic opera.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 141–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 113–14&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sorcerer'' was followed by ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' in 1878. Business for the new opera was slow at first.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's investors in the Comedy Opera Company advocated cutting their losses and closing the show.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; After promotional efforts by Carte and Sullivan, who included some of the ''Pinafore'' music in several [[promenade concert]]s at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], ''Pinafore'' became a hit.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Carte persuaded Gilbert and Sullivan that when their original agreement with the Comedy Opera Company expired in July 1879, a business partnership among the three of them would be to their advantage.&lt;ref name=joseph18&gt;Joseph, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The three each put up £1,000 and formed a new partnership under the name "[[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|Mr Richard D'Oyly Carte's Opera Company]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 162–67&lt;/ref&gt; Under the partnership agreement, once the expenses of mounting the productions had been deducted, each of the three men was entitled to one third of the profits.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

On 31 July 1879, the last day of their agreement with Carte, the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the ''Pinafore'' set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 170–72&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery and props.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 170–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-opcom.html "The Fracas at the Opera Comique",] ''The Theatre'', 1 September 1879, reprinted at the Stage Beauty website, accessed 6 May 2009.

Pinafore'' in London, but it was not as popular as the D'Oyly Carte production and soon closed.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Legal action over the ownership of the rights ended in victory for Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan.&lt;ref name=joseph18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Supreme Court of Judicature, Aug. 1 – Court of Appeal – Gilbert v.

===Early opera successes; property interests===
[[File:Pinafore1899.jpg|thumb|300px|Scene from ''H.M.S. Pinafore'']]
''H.M.S. Pinafore'' was so successful that Carte soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The opera ran for 571 performances in London, the second-longest run in musical theatre history up to that time.&lt;ref name=Longest&gt;The longest-running piece of musical theatre was the operetta ''[[Les Cloches de Corneville]]'', which held that position until the record-breaking run of ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'' in 1886.

To try to counter this [[copyright infringement|copyright piracy]] and make some money from the popularity of their opera in America, Carte travelled to New York with the authors and the company to present an "authentic" production of ''Pinafore'' there, beginning in December 1879, as well as American tours.&lt;ref name=Ainger182&gt;Ainger, pp. 182–83&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's assistant, Helen Lenoir, who became his wife in 1888, made fifteen visits to America in the 1880s and 1890s to promote Carte's interests, superintending arrangements for American productions and tours of each of the new Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=helenDNB/&gt; Beginning with ''Pinafore'', Carte licensed the [[J.

In an effort to head off unauthorised American productions of their next opera, ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Carte and his partners opened it in New York on 31 December 1879, prior to its 1880 London premiere.&lt;ref name=Ainger182/&gt; They hoped to forestall further "piracy" by establishing the authorised production and tours in America before others could copy it and by delaying publication of the score and libretto.

Carte had been planning to build a new theatre for several years to promote English comic opera and, in particular, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=savoyard&gt;"100 Electrifying Years", ''The Savoyard'', Volume XX no. 2, D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust, September 1981, pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 172–72&lt;/ref&gt; With profits from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency, he bought property along the Strand in 1880 with frontage onto the Thames Embankment, where he built the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1881. Carte chose the name in honour of the [[Savoy Palace]], which had been built on the site in the thirteenth century by [[Peter of Savoy, Earl of Richmond|Peter, Count of Savoy]]. It later passed to [[John of Gaunt]] but was destroyed in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The Savoy Theatre was a state-of-the-art facility, setting a new standard for technology, comfort and decor. It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; and seated nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).&lt;ref&gt;[[J. P.

''Patience'' was the first production at the new theatre, transferring there on 10 October 1881. The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire [[front of house]] was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881.

===Peak years for the opera company===
During the years when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written, Richard D'Oyly Carte also produced operas and plays by other writing teams, as well as other works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas. Many of these were [[Savoy opera#Companion pieces|companion pieces]] to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, as the Victorian audiences preferred long evenings in the theatre. Some, however, were new full-length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte's touring companies, which toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and these new works, extensively. Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency. As an example of their level of activity, an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of ''Patience'' in London and its 100th performance in New York states that, in addition to these two productions of ''Patience'', Carte was simultaneously producing many other projects. These included two companies touring with ''Patience'', two touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, one touring with the operetta ''[[Olivette (opera)|Olivette]]'' (co-produced with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]]), one with ''[[Claude Duval (opera)|Claude Duval]]'' in America, a production of ''Youth'' running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of ''Patience'', ''Pirates'', ''Claude Duval'' and ''[[Billee Taylor]]'' in association with [[J. C. Williamson]] in Australia, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091001081006/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/museum/patience/250perf/pc250.html 250th Anniversary ''Patience'' programme, 1881]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte also introduced the practice of licensing amateur theatrical societies to present works for which he held the rights, increasing the works' popularity and the sales of scores and libretti, as well as the rental of band parts.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 81 and 163.&lt;/ref&gt; This had an important influence on amateur theatre in general. Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the [[Savoy opera]]s, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur societies "support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites."&lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to "the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas".&lt;ref name="Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394"&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] was founded in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan operas that year.&lt;ref name="Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394"/&gt;

After ''Patience'', Carte produced ''[[Iolanthe]]'', which opened in 1882. During its run, in February 1883, Carte signed a five-year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, obliging them to create new operas for him upon six months' notice.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan had not intended to immediately write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882 and must have felt the long-term contract necessary for his security.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 217–19&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, "Effectively, [the contract] made [Gilbert and Sullivan] Carte's employees – a situation which created its own resentments."&lt;ref name=Crowthcarpet&gt;Crowther, Andrew. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/quarrel.html "The Carpet Quarrel Explained",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023151629/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/quarrel.html |date=23 October 2010 }} ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', 28 June 1997, accessed 7 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership's next opera, ''[[Princess Ida]]'', opened in January 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 225–26&lt;/ref&gt; Carte soon saw that ''Ida'' was running weakly at the box office and invoked the agreement to call upon his partners to write a new opera. The musical establishment constantly pressured Sullivan to abandon comic opera in favour of serious music,&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The Times'', 27 May 1878, p. 6, favourably reviewing ''H.M.S. Pinafore'', nevertheless added, "we cannot suppress a word of regret that the composer on whom before all others the chances of a national school of music depend should confine himself ... to a class of production which, however attractive, is hardly worthy of the efforts of an accomplished and serious artist."&lt;/ref&gt; and after he was knighted in 1883, the pressure only increased. He soon regretted having signed the five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1884, Sullivan told Carte that "it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself."&lt;ref name=Crowthcarpet/&gt;

During this conflict and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners' differences using a mixture of friendship and business acumen.&lt;ref name=Joseph27/&gt; Sullivan asked to be released from the partnership on several occasions.&lt;ref name=jacobssullivan&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26772?docPos=7 "Sullivan, Arthur Seymour",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Carte was able to coax eight comic operas out of his partners in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ''Pirates'' premiered on 31 December 1879, so technically it's seven, but Joseph counts it as eight. --&gt; When ''Princess Ida'' closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, for the first time in the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready. Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 230–33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|left|Lithograph from ''The Mikado'']]
Carte produced the first revival of ''The Sorcerer'', together with ''Trial by Jury'', and matinees of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' played by a cast of children, while he waited for his partners to finish writing the new work. This became the partnership's most successful opera, ''[[The Mikado]]'', which opened in March 1885.&lt;ref name=Wilson13&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The piece satirised British institutions by setting them in a fictional Japan and took advantage of the Victorian craze for the exotic and "picturesque" Far East.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian. "Japan in London 1885", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', issue 22, Winter 2007, pp. 686–96&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Mikado'' became the partnership's longest-running hit, lasting for 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, and supplanting ''Patience'' as the second-longest-running work of musical theatre up to that time.&lt;ref name=Longest/&gt; It was extraordinarily popular in the US and worldwide and remains the most frequently performed Savoy Opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bradley|first=Ian|url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/hrgsp/old/productions/mik97/mik97hist.htm |title=Note on the popularity of '&amp;#39;The Mikado'&amp;#39; |publisher=Hcs.harvard.edu |accessdate=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John.]] [http://www.musicals101.com/gilbert3.htm "G&amp;S101: G&amp;S Story: Part III"], Musicals101.com, accessed 8 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The partnership's next opera was ''[[Ruddigore]]'', which opened in January 1887. The piece, though a financial success, was a relative disappointment after the extraordinary run of ''The Mikado''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Ruddigore'' closed after nine months, Carte mounted revivals of earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas at the Savoy for almost a year. After another attempt by Gilbert to persuade Sullivan to set a "lozenge plot", Gilbert met his collaborator half way by writing a serio-comic plot for ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', which premiered in October 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; The opera ran for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions. This was a happy time for Carte, with a long-running opera, new marriage and new hotel and opera house under construction.&lt;ref name=Wilson13/&gt; When Carte asked his partners for a new work, Sullivan again expressed reluctance to write another comic opera, asking if Gilbert would write a "dramatic work on a larger musical scale".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert declined but offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted: the two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan could work on a [[grand opera]] that Carte would produce at a new theatre he was planning to build to present British grand opera.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; The new comic opera was ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', which opened in December 1889 and became one of the partnership's greatest successes.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years, Carte was not just the manager of the theatre. He was a full participant in the producing partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, involved in casting and finding designers; in charge of publicity; directing and hiring designers for the non-Gilbert works, including the many companion pieces (sometimes with the help of assistants);&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; and casting, directing and rehearsing the touring companies, among other duties.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henry Lytton]], "Mr. Carte was a great stage manager. He could take in the details of a scene with one sweep of his eagle eye and say unerringly just what was wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Lytton, Henry. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html ''Secrets of a Savoyard''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706175513/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html |date=6 July 2008 }} (1922), chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of Carte's productions created a national and international taste for them, and he sent touring companies throughout the British provinces, to America (generally managed by Helen), Europe&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Bentley/&gt; [[Queen Victoria]] honoured the company by calling for a [[Royal Command Performance]] of ''The Gondoliers'' at [[Windsor Castle]] in 1891. Following the libretto closely, she noticed additions to the text made by some of the actors and asked Carte to explain why this was done. Carte replied that they "are what we call 'gags'". The queen answered that she had always understood that "gags were things that were put by authority into people's mouths." Carte rejoined, "These gags, Your Majesty, are things people put into their own mouths without authority."&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], writing in ''[[The World (journal)|The World]]'' in October 1893, stated:
{{quote|Those who are old enough to compare the Savoy performances with those of the dark ages, taking into account the pictorial treatment of the fabrics and colors on the stage, the cultivation and intelligence of the choristers, the quality of the orchestra, and the degree of artistic good breeding, so to speak, expected from the principals, best know how great an advance has been made by Mr. D'Oyly Carte.&lt;ref&gt;"Utopian Gilbert and Sullivan", ''The World'', 11 October 1893, reprinted in Laurence, pp. 975–76&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===End of the partnership and last years===
[[File:Ivanhoe-programme.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' programme cover]]
On 22 April 1890, during the run of ''The Gondoliers'', Gilbert discovered that maintenance expenses for the theatre, including a new £500&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&amp;use%5B%5D=DEFIND&amp;use%5B%5D=WAGE&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPCP&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPC&amp;year_early=1890&amp;pound71=500&amp;shilling71=&amp;pence71=&amp;amount=500&amp;year_source=1890&amp;year_result=2006 |title=Approximately £37,818.60 in 2006 prices |access-date=19 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714064621/http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&amp;use%5B%5D=DEFIND&amp;use%5B%5D=WAGE&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPCP&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPC&amp;year_early=1890&amp;pound71=500&amp;shilling71=&amp;pence71=&amp;amount=500&amp;year_source=1890&amp;year_result=2006 |archive-date=14 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; carpet for the front lobby of the theatre, were being charged to the partnership instead of borne by Carte. Gilbert angrily confronted Carte, but Carte refused to reconsider the accounts. Even though the amount of the charge was not great, Gilbert felt that it was a moral issue involving Carte's integrity, and he could not look past it. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that "I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen".&lt;ref name=Crowthcarpet/&gt; Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte "in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial."&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Matters deteriorated further, and Gilbert brought a lawsuit. Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building the [[Palace Theatre, London|Royal English Opera House]], the inaugural production of which was to be Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Gilbert won the dispute and felt vindicated, but his actions had been hurtful to his partners, and the partnership disbanded.&lt;ref name=Vowed&gt;Shepherd, Marc. "Introduction: Historical Context", ''The Grand Duke'', p. vii, New York: Oakapple Press, 2009.

Carte's first production at the Royal English Opera House was of Sullivan's only grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'', which opened in January 1891. It played for an initial run of 155 performances, a record for an opera, but no other operas shared the new opera house with it. Instead, ''Ivanhoe'' was presented every night with alternating casts. When ''Ivanhoe'' finally closed in July, Carte had no new work ready to play at the opera house, and so it had to close. The opera house re-opened in November 1891 with [[André Messager]]'s ''[[La Basoche]]'' at first alternating in repertory with ''Ivanhoe'', and then ''La Basoche'' played alone, closing in January 1892.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Carte again had no new opera to present at the house, and the venture soon failed. [[Henry J. Wood|Sir Henry Wood]], who had been [[répétiteur]] for the production, recalled in his autobiography, "If D'Oyly Carte had had a repertory of six operas instead of only one, I believe he would have established English opera in London for all time. Towards the end of the run of ''Ivanhoe'' I was already preparing ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' with [[Eugène Oudin]] in the name part. He would have been superb. However, plans were altered and the ''Dutchman'' was shelved."&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Henry.

[[File:Glad to See You Together.png|thumb|220px|left|The ''Entr'acte'' expresses its pleasure that Gilbert and Sullivan are reunited.]]
Because of the carpet quarrel, Gilbert had vowed to write no more for the Savoy.&lt;ref name=Vowed/&gt; When ''The Gondoliers'' closed in 1891, Carte needed new authors and composers to write works for the Savoy Theatre. He turned to old friends [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance]], [[Frank Desprez]] and [[Edward Solomon]] for his next piece, ''[[The Nautch Girl]]'', which ran for a satisfying 200 performances in 1891–92. Carte then revived Solomon and [[Sydney Grundy]]'s ''[[The Vicar of Bray (opera)|The Vicar of Bray]]'', which ran through the summer of 1892. Next came Grundy and Sullivan's ''[[Haddon Hall]]'', which held the stage until April 1893.&lt;ref name=joseph111&gt;Joseph, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; While Carte presented new pieces and revivals at the Savoy, his touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America. In 1894, for example, Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America.&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoyards on Tour", ''The Sketch'', 13 June 1894, pp. 373–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert's aggressive, though successful, legal action had embittered Carte and Sullivan, but the partnership had been so profitable that Carte and his wife eventually sought to reunite the author and composer. After several attempts by the Cartes, the reconciliation finally came through the efforts of [[Chappell &amp; Co.|Tom Chappell]], who published the sheet music to their operas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Wolfson| first=John| year=1976| title=Final curtain: The last Gilbert and Sullivan Operas|page=7 |publisher=Chappell in association with A. Deutsch| location=London | ISBN=0-903443-12-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, Gilbert and Sullivan produced their penultimate collaboration, ''[[Utopia, Limited]]''. While ''Utopia'' was being prepared, Carte produced ''[[Jane Annie]]'', by [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], with music by [[Ernest Ford]]. Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing after only 51 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Tillett, Selwyn.

[[File:Comic Opera at the Savoy.png|right|thumb|[[George Grossmith]] comforts Carte after failure of ''[[The Grand Duke]]'']]
''Utopia'' was Carte's most expensive production to date, but it ran for a comparatively disappointing 245 performances, until June 1894.&lt;ref name=joseph111/&gt; Carte then played first ''[[Mirette (opera)|Mirette]]'', composed by [[André Messager]], then ''[[The Chieftain]]'', by [[Francis Burnand|F. C. Burnand]] and Sullivan. These ran for 102 and 97 performances, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; The company then toured the London suburbs, and the theatre was dark during the summer of 1895, reopening in November for a revival of ''[[The Mikado]]''.&lt;ref name=Wilson52&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1896 by ''[[The Grand Duke]]'', which ran for 123 performances and was Gilbert and Sullivan's only financial failure. ''The Gondoliers'' turned out to be Gilbert and Sullivan's last big hit, and after ''The Grand Duke'', the two men never collaborated again.&lt;ref name=joseph111/&gt; At the Savoy, Carte produced ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'' (1897), ''[[The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein]]'' (1897), ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'' (1898) and ''[[The Lucky Star]]'' (1899), as well as revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=Wilson52/&gt;

Though the 1890s brought Carte more disappointments than hits in the theatre, his hotel business prospered and grew. He acquired [[Simpson's-in-the-Strand]]&lt;ref name=savoy&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021221064512/http://www.the-savoy-group.com/Simpsons/AboutUs/History/history.asp The Savoy Group, history pages, Simpson's-in-the-Strand], accessed 1 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Claridge's]] Hotel, both of which he entirely rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claridges.co.uk/page.aspx?id=1846 The Savoy Group, history pages, Claridge's], accessed 1 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There was one grave setback, in 1897, when he had to dismiss his manager, Ritz, and his star chef, Escoffier, for financial misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;Brigid, Allen.

He was determined to engage M. Joseph, proprietor of the Marivaux Restaurant in Paris, then at the height of its fame. Carte was seriously ill, but he insisted on being carried to the boat-train. In Paris he bought the Marivaux and returned with Joseph to the Savoy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Mirror]]'', 10 June 1904, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

She profitably managed the theatre and the provincial touring companies.&lt;ref name=helenDNB/&gt; In 1894, Carte had hired his son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], as an assistant.

There he contracted [[tuberculosis]] and later died of that disease at the age of 34.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas was born on 27 December 1872 and was educated at [[Winchester College]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He was called to the bar in 1897. After he contracted tuberculosis, he worked for the rest of his life on issues relating to the disease and died on 18 January 1907. See Obituary of Lucas D'Oyly Carte, ''The Times'', 22 January 1907, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte's London house was at the [[Adelphi, London|Adelphi]], not far from the Savoy.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Passionate about the visual arts as well as the performing arts, Carte invited his friend, the artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James McNeill Whistler]], to decorate the house. Whistler had the entire billiard room painted the colour of the billiard cloth, and elsewhere painted his favourite yellow with his own hand.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally enthusiastic for technological innovation, Carte installed a lift, the first in a private house in England.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1890, he bought a small island in the [[River Thames]], between [[Weybridge]] and [[Shepperton]], called Folly Eyot, which he renamed [[D'Oyly Carte Island]]. He wanted to use the island as an annex to his new [[Savoy Hotel]], but the local authorities refused to grant him a drinks licence for the property.&lt;ref&gt;Barrington, Rutland (1908). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dT1AAAAAIAAJ ''Rutland Barrington: A Record of 35 Years' Experience on the English Stage, By Himself''], p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he built Eyot House, a large house and garden on the island, that he used as a residence.&lt;ref&gt;Pauling, Keith.

Baily speculates that Carte's sense of humour was a bond with Gilbert just as his "cultured musical mind" was a bond with Sullivan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Richard DOyly Carte Grave.JPG|right|upright|thumb|Carte's grave at St Andrews Church, Fairlight]]
Carte died at his London home from [[dropsy]] and heart disease in 1901, just short of his 57th birthday.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=R. D'Oyly Carte is Dead.

A memorial service was held at the Chapel Royal of the Savoy, where a memorial stained glass window was later dedicated to him.&lt;ref name=goodman/&gt; He left an estate valued at £250,000.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This sum is equivalent to more than £100,000,000 in 2007 values: see [http://www.measuringworth.com measuring worth.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte was instrumental in bringing the British theatre from its low status in the mid-Victorian age to a position of respectable eminence, with knighthoods for actors, such as [[Henry Irving]], and for dramatists, including Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 128 ''quoting'' Gilbert, describing mid-19th century productions as "crude, unintelligent, and sometimes frankly improper"&lt;/ref&gt; George Bernard Shaw wrote of Carte's theatrical legacy, "Mr D'Oyly Carte founded a new school of English comic opera; raised operatic inscenation to the rank of a fine art; and finally built a new English Opera House and made a magnificent effort to do for English grand opera what he had done for comic opera."&lt;ref&gt;''The World'', 2 August 1893, ''quoted'' in Laurence, p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; In Carte's obituary, ''[[The Times]]'' noted, "By his refined taste he raised the reputation of the ''mise en scène'' of the Savoy operas to a very high pitch. He set a high standard".&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; Beyond this, however, Carte's influence, through the production of the Savoy operas, heavily influenced the course of the [[Cultural influence of Gilbert and Sullivan#Musical theatre|development of modern musical theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Bargainnier, Earl F. "W. S. Gilbert and American Musical Theatre", pp. 120–33, ''American Popular Music: Readings from the Popular Press'' by Timothy E.

Carte was also a prime mover in making hotels respectable and respected: in the words of the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'': "Led by the prince of Wales [the Savoy] became the meeting place for London high society and the ''nouveaux riches'' of the British empire.... [The] food and the ambience lured people from the clubs to dine in public and give great parties there. It allowed ladies, hitherto fearful of dining in public, to be seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms."&lt;ref&gt;Ashburner, F.[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50441 "Escoffier, Georges Auguste (1846–1935)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2006, accessed 17 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DOCplanter.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Planter in the Embankment Gardens behind the [[Savoy Hotel]]]]
Carte left the theatre, opera company, hotels and his other business interests to Helen.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy Operas in Britain and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 111–27&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 she leased the Savoy Theatre to [[William Greet]], overseeing his management of a revival of ''Iolanthe'' and several new comic operas.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert became chairman of the [[Savoy Hotel]] by 1903, which Helen continued to own.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1906, Helen staged a Gilbert and Sullivan repertory season at the Savoy Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; The season, and the following one, which were both directed by Gilbert, earned excellent reviews and sold well, revitalising the company. After the second repertory season concluded in 1909, however, the company did not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 138 and 186&lt;/ref&gt;

At her death in 1913, Helen passed the family businesses to Carte's son, Rupert. He maintained the hotel business, disposing of the Grand Hotel in Rome, but expanding the group in London.&lt;ref name=profit/&gt; The Savoy Group remained under the control of the Carte family and its associates until 1994.&lt;ref name=billions&gt;Prynn, Jonathan.

Rupert D'Oyly Carte refreshed the opera company's productions and added London seasons, beginning in 1919, as well as provincial and foreign tours.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 160 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 Rupert died, leaving a strong company to his daughter [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 273–74&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became too much for the company. Bridget was forced to close the company in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond, and Carte's vision of wholesome light operas that celebrate Great Britain endures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bradley | first = Ian| authorlink=Ian Bradley|title = Oh Joy!

'''Sandu Florea''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈsandu ˈflore̯a}}; born 28 June 1946) is a [[Romanian-American]] [[comic book]] and [[comic strip]] [[Comic book creator|creator]], also known as an [[inker]] and [[Illustration|book illustrator]]. A trained architect and a presence on the [[science fiction]] scene during the 1970s, he became a professional in the [[comics]] genre with albums such as ''Galbar'', and was allegedly the only artist to have obtained a steady income in this way during the [[Communist Romania|communist period]]. A prolific contributor to Romanian children's magazines, Florea had his activity curbed by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]] when he first publicized his intention of emigrating to the United States. He eventually left the country shortly after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], and soon after began collaborating with [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], [[DC Comics]] and other leading enterprises in the field of comic book publishing. He became especially noted for his activities as an inker, with contributions on series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[The Executioner (book series)|The Executioner]]'', ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'' and ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]''.

Florea has maintained enduring contacts with his native country, and has taken an initiative in popularizing the [[American comic book]] style in Romania. He has been described as one of the most successful among his colleagues, and claimed to be one of the most recognizable Romanians in his field.

==Biography==

===Early life and career in Romania===
[[File:Galbar Sandu Florea.jpg|thumb|left|Scene from ''Galbar'' (1973)]]
Born in [[Ghelari]], [[Hunedoara County]], Sandu Florea first became interested in comics while in fifth grade, his first contact with the medium being through a copy of the [[France|French]] youth magazine ''[[Pif gadget|Pif Vaillant]]''.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"&gt;{{ro icon}} Petrina Calabalic, [http://old.banateanul.ro/articol/ziar/timisoara/cartoon-man/4064/ "Cartoon Man"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008123647/http://old.banateanul.ro/articol/ziar/timisoara/cartoon-man/4064/ |date=2011-10-08 }}, in ''[[Bănăţeanul]]'', December 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This encounter, he recalled in a 2004 interview, left him with "an impression that cannot be erased", and "the wish that I myself could draw such appealing and interesting characters."&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;

Sandu Florea published his first comic strip in 1968, with ''Luminiţa'' children's magazine. It was a series centered on the anecdotal hero classic ''[[Păcală]]''.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.icr.ro/sandu_florea ''Artistul Sandu Florea la Salonul European de Bandă Desenată''], [[Romanian Cultural Institute]] release; retrieved November 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Florea graduated from [[Bucharest]]'s [[Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism|Architectural College]], and subsequently worked for a building design institute in his adoptive city of [[Timişoara]].&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; Before graduation, he had also published his first work in the comics genre, inspired by the [[Folklore of Romania|folkloric tale]] of ''[[Păcală]]'', and featured in a 1968 issue of ''Luminiţa'' magazine.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;

After moving to Timişoara, he became a noted presence among the local [[science fiction]] fan base, joining the [[H. G. Wells]] Literary Club founded by writer Ovidiu Şurianu.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; Their collaboration produced the 1973 ''Galbar'', reportedly the first Romanian [[Science fiction comics|science fiction comic book]].&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://proscris.110mb.com/Ps13-14/florea13.htm "Florea, Sandu"], entry in [[Editura Nemira]]'s ''Dicţionar SF'', 1999 (republished by [http://proscris.110mb.com/ ''Pro-Scris''] [[webzine]]); retrieved August 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he and Timişoara native Marcel Luca published what is thought to be the first-ever Romanian [[coloring book]] with a science fiction subject, ''Vreau să fiu cosmonaut'' ("I Want to be a [[Cosmonaut]]"), which reputedly sold 45,000 copies.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; By then, having received offers of collaboration from two publishing houses ([[Editura Ion Creangă]] and Editura Facla), Florea settled back in Bucharest and focused exclusively on his work in comics and illustration.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt; Said to have been the most prolific comic book author active during the communist period, he had his work featured in almost all of the children's periodicals in print at the time.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was creating and publishing comic books dedicated to popular legends, such as a retake on [[Ion Creangă]]'s [[Fantasy literature|fantasy story]] ''[[Harap Alb]]'', or recounting episodes in [[History of Romania|Romanian history]] (involving [[Dacia]]n rulers [[Burebista]] and [[Decebalus]], [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]],&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cpbatman"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cosmin Popan, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/batman_omorat_in_complicitate_cu_un_roman-65685.html "Batman, omorât în complicitate cu un român"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wallachia]]n [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Michael the Brave]]).&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt; Several single-issue albums in this category were based on texts by [[historical fiction]] author [[Radu Theodoru]], forming part of the series ''Strămoşii'' ("The Ancestors").&lt;ref name="sflambiek"&gt;[http://lambiek.net/artists/f/florea_sandu.htm "Sandu Florea (Romania)"], entry in [[Lambiek]]'s [http://lambiek.net/artists/ ''Comiclopedia'']; retrieved August 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The full list includes: ''Cavalerul alb'' ("The White Knight"; Editura Facla, 1976), ''Călugăreni'' (referencing the [[Battle of Călugăreni]]; Editura Ion Creangă, 1977), ''Misiune de sacrificiu'' ("Suicidal Mission"; Editura Ion Creangă, 1979), ''În lumea lui Harap Alb'' ("Inside Harap Alb's World"; [[Editura Sport-Turism]], 1979), ''Burebista, regele dacilor'' ("Burebista, King of the Dacians"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1980), ''{{lang|ro|Decebal şi Traian}}'' ("Decebalus and Trajan"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1981), ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'' ("Carousel"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1982), ''Sarmizegetusa eroică'' ("Heroic [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]]"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1983).&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt; Florea was also involved in creating Romania's own [[Western comics]], adapted from stories by Nicolae Frînculescu.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;

These works received critical attention, both in Romania and abroad. ''În lumea lui Harap Alb'' earned him the a [[Eurocon]] award (1980).&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sflambiek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mhpremiile"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Michael Hăulică]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/FANTASY-SCIENCE-FICTION.-Premiile-care-au-fost*articleID_14094-articles_details.html "Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction. Premiile care au fost"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 290, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This, literary critic [[Michael Hăulică]] notes, made Florea one in a final wave of Romanian Eurocon laureates to have emerged under communism (also including writers [[Vladimir Colin]], [[Ion Hobana]] and [[Gheorghe Săsărman]]).&lt;ref name="mhpremiile"/&gt;

Florea also received attention from celebrated poet [[Nichita Stănescu]], who discovered in ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'' an unclassifiable and imaginative work. The writer argued: "[Florea] introduces mystery where we usually had happy-endings, imagination where there was lyricism and an indecisive epic where there was nothing. The book he calls ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'' [...] is without precedent, in Romania and everywhere else."&lt;ref name="poeziebd"&gt;{{ro icon}} D.

Florea printed the [[Lithography|lithographs]] to go with the poems, but the project was cut short when Stănescu died (December 1983).&lt;ref name="poeziebd"/&gt;

===In the United States===
The 1984-1989 interval was described by Florea as "one of the most difficult periods in my life."&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; Having unsuccessfully demanded from communist authorities the right of leaving for the United States, where two of his siblings had already settled, Florea was exposed to political persecution, and the [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censorship apparatus]] lifted his right to publish, prompting him to contribute several comic strips under various pseudonyms.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; He returned to public attention after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], when he was briefly editor in chief of the new children's magazine ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}''.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sflambiek"/&gt; With Frînculescu, he also founded another such publication, called ''Proteus''.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;

Sandu Florea, his wife and two children eventually left for the United States in 1991, moving to [[New York City]]&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; and afterward settling in [[Long Island]].&lt;ref name="dnnautil"&gt;{{ro icon}} Dodo Niţă, [http://www.nautilus.nemira.ro/bd/batman-rip/ "''Batman R.I.P.''"], in [[Editura Nemira]]'s ''Nautilus'', March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially discouraged by the competition among comic book artists, Florea recounts, he decided to contact Marvel [[recruiter]]s within three months of his arrival, submitting a sample of his take on ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]''.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; According to his own statement, [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] proved compatible with his talents: "[he was] the only Marvel character who did not fly, did not breathe fire and did not use psychic waves to defeat his enemies, being instead armed with a giant sword and axe. Since I had been drawing many historical tales back in the old country, Conan was a character whom I could depict in drawing with relative ease."&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;

He was accepted by Marvel soon after this, specialized as an inker, and began working on several of its main releases, including, alongside ''Conan'', ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and the various spin-offs of ''[[avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', ''[[Blackwulf]]'', ''[[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]'', ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Mighty Thor]]'', ''[[Captain America]]'', ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sflambiek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; He also worked with [[DC Comics]] (on ''[[Superman (vol. 2)|Superman Second Series]]'',&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'',&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cpbatman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; ''[[Justice Society of America]]'', ''[[Nightwing]]'')&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; and [[Dark Horse Comics]],&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cpbatman"/&gt; signing additional collaborations with [[Innovation Publishing]], Vivid Comics (on ''[[The Executioner (book series)|The Executioner]]'')&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt; and [[Chaos! Comics]] (''[[Lady Death]]'', ''[[Undertaker (comics)|Undertaker]]'').&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; Among the significant miniseries to which he contributed as an inker are ''[[X-Men: The End]]'' (2004–2006),&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'' (2008),&lt;ref name="cpbatman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; and ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'' (2009).&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; His work with Dark Horse included ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sflambiek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; and ''[[List of Angel comics|Angel]]''.&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; His artistic production also touched other media: Florea created [[storyboard]]s and other graphics for the motion picture producers [[Full Moon Features|Full Moon]], as well as book illustrations for ''[[The Princeton Review]]''.&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt;

===2000s initiatives===
[[File:10.15.11SanduFloreaByLuigiNovi2.jpg|thumb|Florea looking over an aspiring artist's portfolio at the 2011 New York Comic Con.]]
Florea was selected honorary president of the Romanian Association of Comic Book Fans in 2001.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt; Speaking in 2004, he expressed interest in relaunching the native comic book genre in his native country, and in publishing a new children's periodical with original content.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; In 2006, he participated in the relaunch of ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'', in a version argued by Hăulică to have been "professional under any definition."&lt;ref name="mhahbd"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Michael Hăulică]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/FANTASY-SCIENCE-FICTION.-Ah-BD*articleID_15202-articles_details.html "Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction. Ah, BD!"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 315, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication, which went out of print after only two issues due to distribution problems, included [[Romanian-language]] reprints of American comics such as ''Conan the Barbarian'' and ''[[Aliens (Dark Horse Comics publications)|Aliens]]'', alongside original collaborations between Florea and his Romanian colleagues: ''Două paloşe'' ("Two [[Backsword]]s", with Florea as artist and György Györfi-Deák as writer), ''Ultima frontieră'' ("The Final Frontier", text by Florea, Marian Mirescu and Eddie Pandele, drawings by Daniel Rizea and Cătălin Gospodin), ''Toxic'' (text by Florea, drawings by Tudor Popa), ''Leviathan'' (written by Cristian Lăzărescu, illustrated by Florea).&lt;ref name="mhahbd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mhbd"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Michael Hăulică]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/FANTASY-SCIENCE-FICTION.-BD*articleID_13366-articles_details.html "Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction. BD"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 273, June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also featured ''Borderland'', a comic series conceived especially for a Romanian public by writer [[John Warner (comics)|John Warner]] and illustrated by Florea, depicting the confrontation between three worlds: of the Mortals, of Magic and of the Demons.&lt;ref name="mhbd"/&gt; Around the same time, Sandu Florea also began contributing to various Romanian [[webzine]]s, such as ''Pro-Scris'', ''Imagikon'' and ''Paradox''—the latter of which published his strip ''Fortăreaţa'', based on a short story by Ovidiu Bufnilă.&lt;ref name="mhbd"/&gt; Several aspects related to the artist's new Romanian ventures were however criticized by Michael Hăulică. He argued that ''Toxic'' in particular was "weak and obvious", and noted that, in its featured edition, the text of ''Borderland'' evidenced its translator's poor command of the Romanian language.&lt;ref name="mhbd"/&gt;

These initiatives helped cement the artist's reputation in Romania. Sandu Florea claims to be "The only Romanian professional graphic artist who has managed to make a living exclusively out of his drawings, in the old country as well as [...] in America."&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; Dodo Niţă, a historiographer of Romanian comics and Florea's colleague at ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'',&lt;ref name="mhbd"/&gt; placed ''În lumea lui Harap Alb'' as fifth among an all-time chart of original Romanian works in the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioana Calen, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/cartarescu_e_tras_in_banda_provocarea_desenata-12202.html "Cărtărescu e tras în bandă - Provocarea desenată"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', June 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2008 piece in the Romanian daily ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', Florea shares the distinction of "best known Romanian comic book artist" with [[Mircea Arapu]], the latter being known for his contribution in [[Franco-Belgian comics|Francophone comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Grama, Vlad Stoicescu, [http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/810028/Rahan-si-Pif-scapati-de-comunism/ "Rahan şi Pif, scăpaţi de comunism"], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', June 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual Romanian comic book [[fan convention]] in [[Constanţa]] awards the Sandu Florea Prize to artists with a long contribution in their field.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} George Onofrei, [http://www.supliment.polirom.ro/article.aspx?article=4171 "Lucian Amarii a cîştigat Premiul ''Sandu Florea'' pentru BD.

[[File:Diana the Huntress - School of Fontainebleau, attributed to Luca Penni.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Diana the Huntress]]'' - School of Fontainebleau (1550–60) (Louvre)]]

The '''Ecole de Fontainebleau''' (c.1530–c.1610) refers to two periods of artistic production in France during the late [[French Renaissance|Renaissance]] centered on the royal [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] that were crucial in forming the French version of [[Northern Mannerism]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/fontainebleau-school Oxford Dictionary of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First School of Fontainebleau (from 1531)==

In 1531, the Florentine artist [[Rosso Fiorentino]], having lost most of his possessions at the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527, was invited by [[Francis I of France|François I]] to come to France, where he began an extensive decorative program for the [[Château de Fontainebleau]].  In 1532 he was joined by another Italian artist, [[Francesco Primaticcio]] (from [[Bologna]]).  Rosso died in France in 1540.  On the advice of Primaticcio, [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]] (from [[Modena]]) was invited to France in 1552 by François's son [[Henry II of France|Henri II]].  Although known for their work at Fontainebleau, these artists were also invited to create works of art for other noble families of the period and were much esteemed and well-paid.
[[File:Scuola di fontainebleau, presunti ritratti di gabrielle d'estrées sua sorella la duchessa di villars, 1594 ca. 04.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Gabrielle d'Estrées and Duchess of Villars, School of Fontainebleau, c.1594]]
[[Image:Meister der Schule von Fontainebleau 003.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Lady at her Toilet'' - School of Fontainebleau (1585–1595) ([[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon]])]]
The works of this "first school of Fontainebleau"  are characterized by the extensive use of [[stucco]] (moldings and picture frames) and [[fresco]]s, and an elaborate (and often mysterious) system of [[Allegory|allegories]] and [[Mythology|mythological]] iconography.  Renaissance decorative motifs such as [[grotesque]]s, [[strapwork]] and [[putti]] are common, as well as a certain degree of eroticism.  The figures are elegant and show the influence of the techniques of the Italian [[Mannerism]]  of [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]] and especially [[Parmigianino]].  Primaticcio was also directed to make copies of antique [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statues for the king, thus spreading the influence of classical statuary.  

Many of the works of Rosso, Primaticcio and [[Niccolò dell'Abbate|dell'Abate]] have not survived; parts of the Chateau were remodelled at various dates.  The paintings of the group were reproduced in [[old master print|prints]], mostly [[etching]]s, which were apparently produced initially at Fontainebleau itself, and later in Paris.  These disseminated the style through France and beyond, and also record several paintings that have not survived.

The [[mannerist style]] of the [[Fontainebleau]] school influenced French artists (with whom the Italians worked) such as the painter [[Jean Cousin the Elder]], the [[sculptors]] [[Jean Goujon]] and [[Germain Pilon]], and, to a lesser degree, the painter and portraitist [[François Clouet]] the son of [[Jean Clouet]].

===Printmaking workshop===
[[File:Ant fantuzzi1.jpg|thumb|Etching by [[Antonio Fantuzzi]], copying a drawing for [[:File:P1290819 Fontainebleau chateau rwk.jpg|this stucco and paint surround]] at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]]]]
[[File:P1290819 Fontainebleau chateau rwk.jpg|thumb|''The Enlightenment of Francois I'' by [[Rosso Fiorentino]], and its surround in the Gallery of Francois I in the palace. A preparatory drawing is copied in the print above.]]
Although there is no certain proof, most scholars have agreed that there was a printmaking workshop at the Palace of Fontainebleau itself, reproducing the designs of the artists for their works in the palace, as well as other compositions they produced.  The most productive printmakers were [[Léon Davent]], [[Antonio Fantuzzi]], and [[Jean Mignon]], followed by the "mysterious" artist known from his monogram as "Master I♀V" (♀ being the [[alchemical symbol]] for [[copper]], from which the printing plates were made),&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 80-83&lt;/ref&gt; and the workshop seems to have been active between about 1542 and 1548 at the latest; [[François I of France]] died in March 1547, after which funding for the palace ended, and the school dispersed.  These were the first etchings made in France, and not far behind the first Italian uses of the technique, which originated in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 80-81; Landau, 308-309&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest impressions of all the Fontainebleau prints are in brown ink, and their intention seems to have been essentially reproductive.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The intention of the workshop was to disseminate the new style developing at the palace more widely, both to France and to the Italians' peers back in Italy.  Whether the initiative to do this came from the king or another patron, or from the artists alone, is unclear. David Landau believes that Primaticcio was the driving force;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 95; Landau, 309&lt;/ref&gt; he had stepped up to become the director of the work at Fontainebleau after the suicide of [[Rosso Fiorentino]] in 1540.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

The enterprise seems to have been "just slightly premature" in terms of catching a market.  The etched prints were often marked by signs of the workshop's inexperience and sometimes incompetence with the technique of etching, and according to Sue Welsh Reed: "Few impressions survive from these plates, and it is questionable whether many were pulled. The plates were often poorly executed and not well printed; they were often scratched or not well polished and did not wipe clean.  Some may have been made of metals soft as copper, such as [[pewter]]."&lt;ref&gt;Reed, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  A broadening market for prints preferred the "highly finished textures" of [[Nicolas Beatrizet]], and later "proficient but ultimately uninspired" engravers such as [[René Boyvin]] and [[Pierre Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;Landau, 309&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable artists of the first school===
*[[Niccolò dell'Abbate]] (c.1509–1571) (Italian)
*[[Damiano del Barbiere]], Italian stuccoist and sculptor
*[[Francesco Scibec da Carpi]] (died c. 1557) Italian furniture maker, who worked on the ''boiseries''.
*[[Léon Davent]], French etcher
*[[Antonio Fantuzzi]], Italian painter and etcher
*[[Rosso Fiorentino]] (Giovanni Battista di Jacopo de' Rossi) (1494–1540) ([[Italy|Italian]])
*[[Juste de Juste]] (c.1505–1559) Franco-Italian sculptor and etcher
*[[Luca Penni]] (c. 1500/1504–1556) (Italian)
*[[Francesco Primaticcio]] (c.1505–1570) (Italian)
*[[Léonard Thiry]], Flemish, painter and etcher

=={{anchor|Second School of Fontainebleau}}Second School of Fontainebleau (from 1594)==

From 1584 to 1594, during the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] the château of Fontainebleau was abandoned.  Upon his accession to the throne, [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]] undertook a renovation of the Fontainebleau buildings using a group of artists: the Flemish born [[Ambroise Dubois]] (from Antwerp)  and the Parisians [[Toussaint Dubreuil]] and [[Martin Fréminet]].  They are sometimes referred to as the "second school of Fontainebleau".  Their late mannerist works, many of which have been lost, continue in the use of elongated and undulating forms and crowded compositions.  Many of their subjects include mythological scenes and scenes from works of fiction by the Italian [[Torquato Tasso]] and the ancient Greek novelist [[Heliodorus of Emesa]].

Their style would continue to have an influence on artists through the first decades of the 17th century, but other artistic currents ([[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]], the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and Flemish [[naturalism (visual art)|naturalist]] schools) would soon eclipse them.

===Notable artists of the second school===
*[[Ambroise Dubois]] (c.1542–1614) ([[Flemings|Flemish]] born)
*[[Toussaint Dubreuil]] (c.1561–1602)
*[[Martin Fréminet]] (1567–1619)

Andrea Beach of [[Common Sense Media]] gave the book a rating of three out of five stars, stating, in part, "Fans of her Miranda Sings YouTube channel will love this colorfully absurd satire of the self-help industry. ...Older teens can be encouraged to think about how Colleen Ballinger ... uses satire, irony, and exaggeration and how those techniques affect the real message conveyed." The site goes on to state, "The book may seem ridiculous at first glance, but mature, media-savvy teens can absorb positive messages about the absurdity of how self-help and self-esteem videos make things look so easy ... and find a sense of community in realizing they're not the only ones who recognize social media's often-unrealistic expectations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrea|last=Beach| url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/book-reviews/selp-helf| title=''Selp-Helf''| website= Common Sense Media|accessdate= April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Systems art''' is [[art]] influenced by [[cybernetics]], and [[systems theory]], that reflects on natural systems, social systems and social signs of the [[art world]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aat-ned.nl/wwwopac.exe?database=aat&amp;language=1&amp;TAB=&amp;%250=2583 Systems art], Dutch Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus, retrieved March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems art emerged as part of the first wave of the [[conceptual art]] movement extended in the 1960s and 1970s. Closely related and overlapping terms are ''[[Anti-form movement]]'', ''[[Cybernetic art]]'', ''Generative Systems'', ''[[Process art]]'', ''Systems aesthetic'', ''Systemic art'', ''Systemic painting'' and ''Systems sculptures''.

==Related fields of systems art==

=== Anti-form movement ===
By the early 1960s Minimalism had emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in [[geometric abstraction]] via [[Malevich]], [[the Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]) which rejected the idea of relational, and subjective painting, the complexity of [[Abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional [[zeitgeist]] and polemics present in the arena of [[Action painting]]. Minimalism argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. The term '''Systematic art''' was coined by [[Lawrence Alloway]] in 1966 as a description of the method artists, such as [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]] and [[Frank Stella]],  were using for composing [[abstract painting]]s.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Chilvers, Ian and Glaves-Smith, John, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'', second edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 694. {{ISBN|0199239665}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with painters such as [[Frank Stella]], minimalism in painting, as opposed to other areas, is a modernist movement. Depending on the context, minimalism might be construed as a precursor to the postmodern movement. Seen from the perspective of writers who sometimes classify it as a postmodern movement, early minimalism began and succeeded as a modernist movement to yield advanced works, but which partially abandoned this project when a few artists changed direction in favor of the anti-form movement.

In the late 1960s the term [[Postminimalism]] was coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]]&lt;ref&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, [[Art &amp; Auction|Art+Auction]], March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe minimalist derived art which had content and contextual overtones which minimalism rejected, and was applied to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Sol LeWitt]], and Barry Le Va, and others. Minimalists like [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce their [[Late modernism|late modernist]] paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.

=== Cybernetic art ===
[[File:Tsai opticalpainting.jpg|thumb|right|''Optical Painting'' by [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] (1964)]] 
Audio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], for example, used "all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media."&lt;ref name="RA 07"&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott," in Roy Ascott (2003, 2007), ''Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness'', University of California, {{ISBN|0-520-22294-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] and cybernetician [[Gordon Pask]] and the animist kinetics of Robert Breer and [[Jean Tinguely]], the 1960s produced a strain of cybernetic art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cybernetic art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and [[Gene Youngblood]] drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist [[Roy Ascott]] with his essay "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in the journal Cybernetica (1966–67), and  the American critic and theorist [[Jack Burnham]]. In ''Beyond Modern Sculpture'' from 1968 Burnham builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Whitelaw (2004), ''Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life'', MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-23234-0}} p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1968, curator Jasia Reichardt organized the landmark exhibition, Cybernetic Serendipity, at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London.

=== Generative systems ===
{{main|Generative art}}
[[File:Dombis 1687.jpg|thumb|Installation view of ''Irrational Geometrics'' 2008 by [[Pascal Dombis]]]]
Generative art is [[art]] that has been generated, composed, or constructed in an [[algorithmic art|algorithmic]] manner through the use of systems defined by [[computer]] [[software]] [[algorithms]], or similar [[mathematical]] or mechanical or [[random]]ised autonomous processes. [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] established Generative Systems as a program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"&gt;Sonia Landy Sheridan, "Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 16, No. 2 (Spring, 1983), pp. 103-108. {{doi|10.2307/1574794}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, which brought artists and scientists together, was an effort at turning the artist's passive role into an active one by promoting the investigation of contemporary scientific—technological systems and their relationship to art and life. Unlike copier art, which was a simple commercial spin-off, Generative Systems was actually involved in the development of elegant yet simple systems intended for creative use by the general population. Generative Systems artists attempted to bridge the gap between elite and novice by directing the line of communication between the two, thus bringing first generation information to greater numbers of people and bypassing the entrepreneur.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"/&gt;

=== Process art ===
{{main|Process art}}
[[File:Bolognini-CIMs.JPG|thumb|right|[[Maurizio Bolognini]], ''Collective Intelligence Machines'' series (CIMs, from 2000). These are generative and interactive installations using the mobile phone network and participation technologies taken from e-democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurizio Bolognini]], "De l'interaction à la démocratie. Vers un art génératif post-digital" / [http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm "From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art"], in ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique'', Edition L'Harmattan. Paris, 2011, pp. 229-239.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Process art is an [[artistic movement]] as well as a creative sentiment and world view where the end product of ''art'' and ''craft'', the ''[[:wikt:objet d’art|objet d’art]]'', is not the principal focus. The 'process' in process art refers to the process of the formation of art: the gathering, sorting, collating, associating, and patterning.  Process art is concerned with the actual ''doing''; art as a [[rite]], [[ritual]], and [[performance]]. Process art often entails an inherent motivation, rationale, and [[intentionality]]. Therefore, art is viewed as a creative journey or process, rather than as a deliverable or end product.
In the artistic discourse the work of [[Jackson Pollock]] is hailed as an antecedent. Process art in its employment of [[serendipity]] has a marked correspondence with [[Dada]]. Change and transience are marked themes in the process art movement. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] states that Robert Morris in 1968 had a groundbreaking exhibition and essay defining the movement and the Museum Website states as "Process artists were involved in issues attendant to the body, random occurrences, improvisation, and the liberating qualities of nontraditional materials such as wax, felt, and latex. Using these, they created eccentric forms in erratic or irregular arrangements produced by actions such as cutting, hanging, and dropping, or organic processes such as growth, condensation, freezing, or decomposition".&lt;ref&gt;Source:  {{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200906/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} (accessed: Thursday, March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Systemic art ===
According to Chilvers (2004) "earlier in 1966 the British art critic [[Lawrence Alloway]] had coined the term "Systemic art", to describe a type of abstract art characterized by the use of very simple standardized forms, usually geometric in character, either in a single concentrated image or repeated in a system arranged according to a clearly visible principle of organization. He considered the chevron paintings of [[Kenneth Noland]] as examples of Systemic art, and considered this as a branch of [[Minimal art]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Systemic art." The Oxford Dictionary of Art. Ed. Ian Chilvers. Oxford University Press, 2004. eNotes.com. 2006. 19 Mar, 2008 [http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/ systemic-art]&lt;/ref&gt;

John G. Harries considered a common ground in the ideas that underlie developments in 20th-century art such as [[Serial art]], Systems Art, [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Kinetic art]]. These kind of arts often do not stem directly from observations of things visible in the external natural environment, but from the observation of depicted shapes and of the relationship between them.&lt;ref name = "JGH 81"&gt;John G. Harries, "Personal Computers and Notated Visual Art", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 14, No. 4 (Autumn, 1981), pp. 299-301.&lt;/ref&gt; Systems art, according to Harries, represents a deliberate attempt by artists to develop a more flexible frame of reference. A style in which its frame of reference is taken as a model to be emulated rather than as a cognitive systems, that only leads to the institutionalization of the imposed model. But to transfer the meaning of a picture to its location within a systemic structure does not remove the need to define the constitutive elements of the system: if they are not defined, one will not know how to build the system.&lt;ref name = "JGH 81"/&gt;

=== Systemic painting ===
Systemic Painting, according to Auping (1989) "was the title of an highly influential exhibition at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in 1966 assembled and introduction written by [[Lawrence Alloway]] as curator. The show contained numerous works that many critics today would consider part of the [[Minimal art]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Auping (1989), ''Abstraction, Geometry, Painting: Selected Geometric Abstract Painting'', Albright-Knox Art Gallery, page 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In the catalogue Alloway noted, that ... "paintings, such as those in this exhibition are not, as has been often claimed, impersonal. The personal is not expunged by using a neat technique: anonymity is not a consequence of highly finishing a painting".&lt;ref name = "LA 66"&gt;Lawrence Alloway, "Systemic Painting", in: ''Minimal Art: A Critical Anthology'', by Gregory Battcock (1995). p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "systemic painting" later on has become the name for artists who employ systems make a number of aesthetic decisions before commencing 
to paint.&lt;ref&gt;John Albert Walker (1973), ''Glossary of Art, Architecture, and Design Since 1945: Terms and Labels'', p.197.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Systems sculpture ===
According to Feldman (1987) "[[serial art]], serial painting, systems sculpture and [[ABC art]], were art styles of the 1960s and 1970s in which simple geometric configurations are repeated with little or no variation. Sequences becomes important as in mathematics and linguistic context. These works rely on simple arrangements of basic volumes and voids, mechanically produced surfaces, and algebraic permutations of form. The impact on the viewer, however, is anything but simple".&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke Feldman (1987), ''Composition (Art)'', H.N. Abrams, {{ISBN|0-13-940602-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty''''' is an unauthorized biography of the [[Bush family]] by the American [[investigative journalist]] [[Kitty Kelley]]. It was published on September 14, 2004, less than two months before the [[2004 US Presidential election]]. Reviews of the book were mixed, with some of the "accusations," according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "[standing] up better than others."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/books/review/the-family-here-comes-the-son.html|title='The Family': Here Comes the Son|last=Widmer|first=Ted|date=2004-10-10|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-26|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glynn Wilson, a free-lance journalist from [[Alabama]], sued Kelley for plagiarism claiming passages from the book have the exact wording as his online article.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/17/books/a-writer-is-suing-the-author-of-a-hit-book-on-the-bushes.html|title=A Writer Is Suing the Author of a Hit Book on the Bushes|last=Wyatt|first=Edward|date=2004-11-17|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-26|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Father Christmas Letters''''', also known as '''''Letters from Father Christmas''''', are a collection of [[Letter (message)|letters]] written and illustrated by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] between 1920 and 1942 for his children, from [[Father Christmas]]. They were released posthumously by the Tolkien estate on 2 September 1976, the 3rd anniversary of Tolkien’s death. They were edited by [[Baillie Tolkien]], second wife of his youngest son, [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]]. The book was warmly received by critics, and it has been suggested that elements of the stories inspired parts of Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==Plot==
The stories are told in the format of a series of letters, told either from the point of view of Father Christmas or his elvish secretary. They document the adventures and misadventures of Father Christmas and his helpers, including the North Polar Bear and his two sidekick cubs, Paksu and Valkotukka. The stories include descriptions of the massive fireworks that create the [[Aurora (astronomy)|northern lights]] and how Polar Bear manages to get into trouble on more than one occasion.

The 1939 letter has Father Christmas making reference to the [[Second World War]],&lt;ref name=willardreview /&gt; while some of the later letters feature Father Christmas' battles against Goblins which were subsequently interpreted as being a reflection of Tolkien's views on the [[Nazi Party|German Menace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#walsh|Walsh (2001)]]: p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The letters themselves were written over a period of over 20 years to entertain Tolkien's children each Christmas. Starting in 1920 when Tolkien's oldest son was aged three,&lt;ref name=willardreview&gt;{{cite news|last=Willard|first=Nancy|title=Christmas Letters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/12/05/books/tolkien-christmas.html?_r=0|accessdate=22 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 December 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; each Christmas Tolkien would write a letter from Father Christmas about his travels and adventures.&lt;ref name=travels&gt;{{cite news|title=Grand Tours: Who Travels the World in a Single Night?|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P2-1716622/travel-etc-grand-tours-who-travels-the-world-in|accessdate=22 November 2012|newspaper=The Independent on Sunday|date=22 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each letter was delivered in an envelope, including North Pole stamps and postage marks as designed by Tolkien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tolkien's "Father Christmas Letters"|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2001/12/07/books/tolk-christmas.slideshow_1.html|accessdate=22 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to publication, an exhibition of Tolkien's drawings was held at the [[Ashmolean Museum]]. These included works from ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''Lord of the Rings'', and ''The Father Christmas Letters''.&lt;ref name="john136"&gt;[[#johnson|Johnson (1986)]]: p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowe|first=Ian|title=Gazette: Diana Caithness|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P2-4628707/gazette-diana-caithness|accessdate=22 November 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=13 January 1994}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was by [[Allen and Unwin]] on 2 September 1976, three years after Tolkien's death. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition was released later that year on 19 October.&lt;ref name=tolklibrary&gt;{{cite web|title=The Father Christmas Letters|url=http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/booksbytolkien/fatherchristmas/description.htm|publisher=The Tolkien Library|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third work by Tolkien to be released posthumously, after a collection of poems and the ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref name="john133"&gt;[[#johnson|Johnson (1986)]]: p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Edited by [[Baillie Tolkien]],&lt;ref name="drew421"&gt;[[#drew|Drew (1997)]]: p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; the second wife of [[Christopher Tolkien]],&lt;ref name=willardreview/&gt; it includes illustrations by Tolkien for nearly all the letters; however, it omitted several letters and drawings.&lt;ref name=paperback&gt;{{cite web|title=Letters from Father Christmas paperback (16.08.09)|url=http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/907-Letters_from_Father_Christmas.php|publisher=The Tolkien Library|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the book was republished in 1999 it was retitled ''Letters from Father Christmas'' and several letters and drawings not contained in the original edition were added.&lt;ref name=paperback/&gt;&lt;ref name="thomp11"&gt;[[#thompson|Thompson (2007)]]: p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; One edition in 1995 featured the letters and drawings contained in individual envelopes to be read in the manner they were originally conceived to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stocking Fillers|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P2-4752382/stocking-fillers|accessdate=22 November 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=19 November 1995}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The reception to the first two works published posthumously had been warm, which was subsequently thought to be due to Tolkien's recent death. The response to ''The Father Christmas Letters'' was much more measured and balanced.&lt;ref name="john133"/&gt; Jessica Kemball-Cook suggested in her book ''Twentieth Century Children's Writers'' that it would become known as a classic of children's literature,&lt;ref name="john188"&gt;[[#johnson|Johnson (1986)]]: p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; while Nancy Willard for ''[[The New York Times]] Book Review'' also received the book positively, saying "Father Christmas lives. And never more merrily than in these pages."&lt;ref name=willardreview /&gt; In 2002, an article in ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' described the work as rivalling "''The Lord of the Rings'' for sheer imaginative joy".&lt;ref name=travels /&gt;

==Influence==
Paul H. Kocher, whilst writing for the journal ''Mythprint'', suggested that the creatures in ''The Father Christmas Letters'' may have been a precursor to those which appeared in Tolkien's later works such as the ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'',&lt;ref name="john158"&gt;[[#johnson|Johnson (1986)]]: p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; a view which was shared by Laurence and Martha Krieg in a review in the journal ''Mythlore'' (issue #14).&lt;ref name="john159"/&gt; For example, the 1933 letter features an attack on Polar Bear by a band of goblins.&lt;ref name=sack&gt;{{cite news|last=Garfield|first=Simon|title=Dear Santa, Please Sack Christmas Carole|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-81089339/dear-santa-please-sack-christmas-carole-radio|accessdate=22 November 2012|newspaper=The Mail on Sunday|date=23 December 2001}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kriegs suggested that the wizard [[Gandalf]] may have been developed from Father Christmas.&lt;ref name="john159"&gt;[[#johnson|Johnson (1986)]]: p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Suicide of Saul''''' is an oil-on-panel by [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|the Netherlandish Renaissance]] artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], painted in 1562. It is currently held and exhibited at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]].

==Description==
[[Image:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Suicide of Saul (detail) - WGA3328.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail 1]]
The inscription identifies the subject as the rarely represented scene of the suicide of [[Saul]] after his defeat by the [[Philistines]]. These events are described in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel 31, 1-5]]: {{quotation| Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. Then the Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul's sons. The battle became fierce against Saul. The archers hit him, and he was severely wounded by the archers.
&lt;br /&gt;Then Saul said to his armorbearer, "Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised men come and thrust me through and abuse me."&lt;br /&gt;But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword and fell on it. And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword, and died with him.|1 Samuel 31:1-5, [[NKJV]]&lt;ref&gt;From online [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2031,%201-5&amp;version=NKJV NKJV, 1 Samuel 31]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Bruegel has chosen the highly dramatic moment of the death of the armourbearer, just as the Philistines are approaching.&lt;sup&gt;See 1st detail&lt;/sup&gt;

Saul's death was interpreted as a punishment of [[pride]] - it was among the proud that [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] met [[Saul]] in the ''[[Purgatorio]]'' - and this may account for Bruegel's choice of such an unusual subject.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Dante's ''Canto'' XII, vv.40-42: ''O Saul, transfixed by your own sword, how dead / you seemed to lie on Mount Gilboa's plain, / which since that time has known no rain or dew.'' (transl. M. Musa, Penguin Books, 1985). Saul was placed in the 2nd Terrace of [[Purgatory]], with King [[Nimrod]], the subject of another Bruegel painting, ''[[The Tower of Babel (Bruegel)|The Tower of Babel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Suicide of Saul (detail) - WGA3327.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail 2]]
As with most of his subjects taken from the Bible, Bruegel treats Saul's suicide as a contemporary event, showing the armies in 16th century armour. In 1529 the German painter [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] had shown the clash of the forces of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Darius III of Persia|Darius]] at the [[The Battle of Alexander at Issus|Battle of the Issus]] in this way, and in many other respects, too, Bruegel is in Altdorfer's debt, particularly in the representation of the tiny, massed figures of the soldiers and their forests of lances.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the great battle scenes of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] are strongly reminiscent of this composition's battle deployment.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruegel may also have looked at the battle-scenes of another German painter, [[Jörg Breu the Younger]], and at a now lost battle-scene by the [[Antwerp]] landscape painter [[Joachim Patinir]] which is mentioned by [[biographer]] [[Karel van Mander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Screech|first=Matthew|title=Masters of the ninth art: bandes dessinées and Franco-Belgian identity|year=2005|publisher=Liverpool University Press|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvkGQnWZf1gC&amp;pg=PA85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Suicide of Saul'' is an early attempt by Bruegel to reconcile landscape and figure painting. If it is compared with one of his latest works, ''[[The Magpie on the Gallows]]'' of 1568, its weaknesses are apparent: the foreground and background are not yet reconciled and the jutting outcrop of rock in the centre&lt;sup&gt;see 2nd detail&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[Mannerism|mannerist]] device which one may see again in ''[[The Procession to Calvary (Bruegel)|The Procession to Calvary]]''. However, the distant landscape is seen through a shimmering haze, which seems to have the effect of emphasizing the foreground detail, and this does represent a new stage in the evolution of Bruegel's depiction of [[landscape art|naturalistic landscape]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Pietro Allegretti, ''Brueghel'', Skira, Milano 2003. {{ISBN|0-00-001088-X}} {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodorus van Hoytema''', or '''Hoijtema''' (18 December 1863, [[The Hague]] - 28 August 1917, The Hague) was a Dutch [[lithographer]], illustrator and graphic designer, known for his book covers and calendars; especially those depicting birds.

== Biography ==
[[File:Het leelijke jonge eendje.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Illustration from&lt;br /&gt; ''The Ugly Duckling'']]
His father was Secretary-General of the Department of Finance.&lt;ref name="H"&gt;[http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn3/hoijtema Brief biography] @ Huygens/Resources.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest of eight children. Both of his parents died during the 1870s, so he and some siblings moved to Klein Stadwijk, a village in [[Voorschoten]]. There, he received his first drawing lessons from his eldest sister. He attended the [[Stedelijk Gymnasium Leiden]] and, together with two of his older brothers, passed an exam that enabled them to find work at a financial firm. Theo, however, was not satisfied with office life and decided to become an artist.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=4180371 Brief biography] @ Christie's.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He began by taking drawing classes at the [[Royal Academy of Art, The Hague|Royal Academy of Art]]. While there, he drew and painted the stuffed animals at the [[Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie]] in Leiden. As a result, his uncle Adriaan van Oordt, Director of [[Brill Publishers]], was able to get him his first commissions doing scientific illustrations.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; From 1889 to 1890, he became interested in lithography. That same year, he took up temporary residence in a garden house at {{ill|Binckhorst Castle|nl|Kasteel de Binckhorst}}. The following year, after the success of his first picture book about birds (''Hoe de vogels aan een koning kwamen''), he was married and moved to [[Loosduinen]]. The marriage was, however, short-lived and childless, ending in divorce in 1902.

In 1892, he became a member of the [[Haagsche Kunstkring]] and joined [[Arti et Amicitiae]] in 1893.&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; That same year, he produced an illustrated edition of ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'' by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], followed by several more bird-themed picture books.

He continued to move, restlessly, first to [[Voorburg]] then, in 1897, to [[Hilversum]]. For a time, he stayed with family members in London. His health became fragile and he was hospitalized for much of 1904 and 1905. He also spent a short time at a psychiatric sanatorium. When released, he went to live with a sister in The Hague and remained there, under her care, for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt;

Despite his illness, it was during this period that he created the calendars that made him famous. His designs also formed the basis for pottery and furniture.&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; He and his wife were the models for the main characters in ''Leo en Gerda'' (1911), a novel by {{ill|Aegidius Willem Timmerman|nl}} about the generation of artists who began their careers in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/timm004tims01_01/timm004tims01_01_0016.php Items on Timmerman] @ [[Digital Library for Dutch Literature|DBNL]].&lt;/ref&gt; A street was named after him in 1923, and a monument was placed there in 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6552">'''Thrift store chic''' refers to a style of dressing where clothes are cheap and/or used. Clothes are often bought from [[thrift stores]] such as the [[Salvation Army]], [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]], or [[Value Village]]. Originally popular among the [[hippie]]s of the late 1960s, this fashion movement resurfaced during the mid-1980s among teenagers, and expanded into the 1990s with the growing popularity of such music and style influences including the grunge band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Thrift store chic can be considered as an [[anti-fashion]] statement because it does not follow [[fashion trends]] and does not attempt to look expensive or new.

Thrift store chic is often composed of [[Vintage (design)|vintage]] T-shirts (striped tees and anything with vintage graphics, in particular), sweaters, [[flannel]] ‘lumberjack’ shirts, and worn and torn jeans. This laid back, nonchalant, and aloof look became fashionable and trendy without attempting to. Originally worn for a variety of reasons, which include an homage, or attempt to resurrect earlier styles, or even in protest to the exploitation of [[third world]] [[child worker]]s in [[sweat shop]]s.  By the late 2000s many of the younger [[indie kid]]s wore thrift store clothes primarily for its ironic anti-fashion connotations, attempting to look like a homeless person who can afford expensive electronics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbez.org/blogs/alison-cuddy/2013-05/searching-sweat-free-fashion-chicago-107175 Sweat free Chicago]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thrift store chic is also popular among people who enjoy creating their own outfits from pieces of used clothing. This DIY (do-it-yourself) approach creates original articles of clothing that can be very personalized. For example, in the 1986 movie ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'', [[Molly Ringwald]]’s character, Andie Walsh,&lt;ref&gt;IMDb https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091790/, ''Pretty in Pink'', 1984, Retrieved on March 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; is fond of taking clothing from thrift stores and creating a unique and eclectic wardrobe. One very memorable article is the prom dress she creates, made from merging two separate dresses.

During the 1990s, singers such as [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Courtney Love]], and [[Eddie Vedder]] promoted the look. Kurt Cobain’s style included uncoordinated and non-brand-name items of clothing &lt;ref&gt;Havlin, Laura
http://www.anothermag.com/current/view/1425/Kurt_Cobain, ''AnOther'', Men's Fashion, September 28, 2011, Retrieved on March 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; that created the look of a carelessly cool [[grunge rock]] star. Clothes often had holes or tears in them and were worn in many layers, which hid the body.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Magda. http://www.mookychick.co.uk/alternative-fashion/style/grunge-fashion.php, “How to Wear Grunge Fashion”, mookychick, Retrieved on March 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Cobain’s modest style contrasted from the aggressive and glamorous style of bands such as [[Guns N’ Roses]]. Fans of Nirvana found it easy to emulate his style, thus identifying themselves and the grunge movement. His thrift store style also reflected an ironic stance against corporate culture. Ironic, because his band had signed with the corporate music label [[Geffen Records]].&lt;ref&gt;Gogola, Tom. http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=3be64cf5-3964-4fef-be78-4bbcfb9f8254%40sessionmgr13&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=101

Entering the 2000s, this look because associated with musical scenes including [[indie rock]] and [[emo]] and bands such as Christopher Owen's "Girls" , [[Ariel Pink]]'s Haunted Graffiti, and Seahorse Liberation Army, gradually spreading to the [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster movement]]. The hipster movement is popular among people in their 20s and 30s whose style attempts to reject mainstream trends. The hipster movement embraced thrift store chic because of its love for vintage items, especially clothing.  Items that became popular for indie girls included flowery cotton dresses, cardigans, [[keffiyeh]]s, and eyeglasses chosen deliberately for their unfashionable connotations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/jobs/plan_b_nation/2013/09/the_meaning_of_a_five_dollar_d.html Five dollar dress]&lt;/ref&gt; Hipster-thrift-store-chic embraces [[nostalgia]] and irony by combining old trucker-caps and vintage bowling t-shirts with worn luxury goods like [[leather jacket]]s, old military [[dress uniform]]s as a protest against the war in Iraq, or used business wear, such as [[tweed cloth]] [[sportcoat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, Alex. http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/14/hate-hipsters-blogs, “Why Do People Hate Hipsters?” The Guardian. Thursday, 14 October 2010. Retrieved on March 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the stock market crash of 2008, shopping at thrift stores became more widely accepted. Bragging about how much an item of clothing cost was no longer about how expensive it was, but rather how cheap it cost.&lt;ref&gt;Zekas, Rita. https://www.thestar.com/living/article/574815--thrift-store-chic, “Thrift Store Chic” The Star. January 22, 2009. Retrieved on March 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Showing off a six-hundred-dollar pair of shoes when people were losing their jobs was no longer tactful. In the United States, resale stores experienced an average of 35% increase in sales. Purchasing used clothing has lost much of its stigma also due to the growing environmental movement towards consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumpf, Heidi. http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=513660d1-49a8-4a44-a8f8-a92c91438957%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=101

Because textiles can be difficult to recycle (especially mixed blends), reusing clothing is considered environmentally friendly because it makes use of material that would have otherwise potentially ended up in a [[landfill]].

In 2013, the [[Macklemore]] and Lewis's single "[[Thrift Shop]]" reached number 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song glorifies shopping at thrift shops and denounces expensive brands, such as Gucci, as "getting tricked by a business."

The '''Cathedral of St. James''' ({{lang-hr|Katedrala sv. Jakova}}) in
[[Šibenik]], [[Croatia]] is a triple-nave [[basilica]] with three apses and a dome (32 m high inside) in the city of Šibenik, Croatia. It is the church of the [[Catholic Church in Croatia]], and the see of the Šibenik [[diocese]]. It is also the most important architectural monument of the [[Renaissance]] in the entire country. Since 2000, the Cathedral has been on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]].

It is often known as "St Jacob's", because [[Croatian language|Croatian]], like many other languages, uses the same name for both "James" and "Jacob". It is dedicated to [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James the Greater]].

==Construction==

===First masters===
The building of the church was initiated in 1402, though plans on its construction had already begun in 1298, when Šibenik became a municipality. The actual work to transform the older [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] cathedral began in 1431. 
Built entirely of stone ([[limestone]] from a nearby stone quarry and marble from the island of [[Brač]]), it was completed in three phases, from 1433 to 1441, when the Grand City Council entrusted the work to local and Italian masters Francesco di Giacomo, Lorenzo Pincino, Pier Paolo Bussato, Bonino da Milano, and [[Giorgio da Sebenico]] (''Juraj Dalmatinac'') and to Croatian ones Andrija Budčić and Grubiš Šlafčić.

===Giorgio da Sebenico===
[[Image:Baptismal font, Cathedral of St. James, Sibenik2 (js).jpg|thumb|left|100px|the Baptistery]]
Initially, it was conceived as a simple church. With tremendous skill, Giorgio da Sebenico combined architectural and decorative elements to create a unified entity. He constructed the western main portal, the northern portal (The Lion Gate) and the first chapel. The '''western main portal''' was decorated by the Bonino da Milano, first master mason, with statues of Christ and the twelve apostles. The bronze door was created in 1967 by the Šibenik sculptor Grga Antunac.
[[File:Cathedral of St. Jacob in Šibenik (26).JPG|thumb|left|The Lion Gate]]
The motif of the northern portal, called the '''Lion Gate''', are Adam and Eve standing on two lions, which is also seen at the [[Trogir Cathedral]], but here Adam and Eve are on columns over the lions. These statues, together with St. Jacob and St. Peter, are the work of Juraj Dalmatinac, as he is called in Croatia. The statue of Eve draws the attention of onlookers as she has a belly button, while, according to the Bible, she was conceived from a rib of Adam.The bronze doors were made in 1967 by the Šibenik sculptor Grga Antunac.

The two Renaissance putti at the northern end of the cathedral bear an inscription of the consecration in 1443 of the cathedral. Under their feet is his only remaining signature: "Hoc opus cuvarum fecit magister Georgius Matthei Dalmaticus". He also designed the baptistery in the 1440s. He built it next to the southern apse in the form of a [[quatrefoil]]. The upper part is covered with lacelike sculptures, the first Renaissance sculptural work in Croatia. The flat niches are vaulted with corrugated seashells of St. James. On the baldachins between them hold two statues: King David and the prophet Simon. The vault ribs end in the keystone representing the [[Father God]], surrounded by angels and the dove (symbol of the [[Holy Ghost]]). The baptismal font, made from reddish [[breccia]]s, is supported by three angels.

===Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino===
[[Image:St James cathedral main portal.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Portal - detail]]
Between 1475 and 1505 the work was overseen by [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] master [[Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino]] (''Nicola Firentinac''), from the Donatello school of sculpture who developed as a sculptor and builder in [[Dalmatia]]. He continued the building in the Tuscan [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]], completing the extensive galleries, building the vault in the central nave, the outer sculptures of St. Michael, St. James and St. Mark. The drawing of this sculpture of St. Michael became also the coat of arms of the city of Šibenik, because in the 12th century the [[justiciar]] of [[Monte Sant'Angelo]], who was from [[Siponto]], was sent by [[Pope Alexander III]] as a notifier to Šibenik. According to the Longobard writer Pavlo Đakon from the year 642, Croats have many ships under the city of Siponto. &lt;!-- St. James, because James and John were with their father by the seashore when Jesus called them. Another St. John was bishop of Trogir. --&gt; Šibenik and Trogir as sovereign [[city-states]] had with each other treaties of alliance, but the duke was annoyed, after which he was driven out of Trogir. The barrel roof is made from a line of enormous stone slabs and considered a marvel of construction at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bousfield, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UxSnm-mUp40C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=Juraj+Dalmatinac&amp;lr=&amp;hl=cs&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=Juraj%20Dalmatinac&amp;f=false ''The Rough Guide to Croatia''], pg. 278, Rough Guides (2003), {{ISBN|1-84353-084-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the upper [[façade]]. He also built the triforias (parallel galleries) and worked on the presbytery and sanctuary.
[[File:Cathedral of St. Jacob in Šibenik (1).JPG|thumb|Dome of the cathedral and sculpture of St. Michael]]
Although the dome of Šibenik Cathedral was built after the dome in [[Florence Cathedral|Florence]], [[Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino]] used an octagonal drum in its construction, before Bramante and Michelangelo, in its original function as the transition from the square base to the circular dome.&lt;ref name="Naprijed"/&gt; The execution of the cupola is considered one of the best achievements of Renaissance architecture.

===Artistic trinity===
This gate as a side entrance forms an artistic [[trinity]] with the abbey of San Leonardo di Siponto. Furthermore, the angels on the ceiling of Hagia Sophia are on the ceiling of the cathedral of San Marco in Venice, where are the horses of the Hippodrome of Constantinople, and on the ceiling of the Trogir cathedral, too. Over the Lion Gate of the Šibenik cathedral are the coat of arms of two bishops and of the [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]] of the church of Saint Saviour in Šibenik. The church of Saint Saviour in Šibenik became part of the [[Barracks|barrack]] in the 18th century. The coat of arms of this procurator shows two bars. The drawing on the ceiling over the Imperial Gate of the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople shows two bars, too. This forms an artistic trinity between the church of St.Saviour in Šibenik, the city of Šibenik and the Hagia Sophia. The crest of this coat of arms shows a lion holding a sun.  This forms an artistic trinity between the church of St.Saviour in Šibenik, the San Marco cathedral in Venice with its lion of San Marco, and the abbey of San Leonardo di Siponto, which ceiling is designed according to the astronomical midday. This procurator was elected by the great assembly of the people of the city of Šibenik, which financed this building. The title of a procurator carried immense prestige. In Venice there was just one procurator, the [[Procurator of San Marco]]. In the period between 1441 and 1473 the building work was directed by Giorgio, who was invited to come from [[Venice]] as the investors were not satisfied with the beginning of the work. His first contract in 1441 was concluded for a period of 6 years to build just a simple church, but another contract of 10 years followed the first one in 1446.

[[File:Sibenik pentacle.jpg|thumb|Pentacle on the baptismal font of the Šibenik Cathedral.]]

Such a master of his art was difficult to find even then. However, until the cathedral was finished, there were a large number of procurators in Šibenik such as the Procurator of the factory of Santa Maria. The Pope in Rome was asked to meet the procurators in Šibenik, but it is not known if they met personally. In 1451, the bishops of Venice became [[Patriarch of Venice|Patriarchs of Venice]]. Most of the procurators in Šibenik remained anonymous. Their portraits are outside on the wall of the cathedral. Some of these heads on the facade have a damaged nose, probably due to vandalism. Indeed, until [[Justinian II]] this was the expression to discredit the reputation of someone, and so it was necessary that this individual remained anonymous. They considered that too little for the money spent, so Giorgio altered the plan: he enlarged the cathedral with a side [[nave]] and [[apse]]s, so that the ground plan of the cathedral was in the shape of a cross, and prepared it for the [[dome]], built the presbytery, sanctuary and his masterpiece, the [[baptistery]]. [[File:Artistic trinities of the cathedral in Sibenik.JPG|thumb|160px|right|Combination of artistic trinities.]] Giorgio combined the mentioned artistic trinities of the 6 mentioned locations in the ground plan. St. Saviour as the apses, the city of Šibenik as the Lion Gate vis-a-vis of the abbey of San Leonardo di Siponto, Saint John (Trogir cathedral) as the central nave what is also symbolized by an eagle as the [[Evangelist's symbol#Evangelists.27 symbols|John the Evangelist's symbol]] outside on the wall over the main entrance, the San Marco cathedral in Venice as one side nave and the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople as the other side nave. 
[[File:Cathedral of St. Jacob in Šibenik (9).JPG|thumb|left|Two Renaissance putti]]
The extension of the line from the main entrance to the apse shows towards [[Jerusalem]], but as an [[Great-circle distance|orthodromic distance curve]] shows towards the [[obelisk]] of the [[Karnak Temple]], from where are the [[sphinx]]es in the [[Diocletian's Palace]] in Split. The description of the Karnak temple by an unknown "Venetian" was brought to Venice in 1589 and is now in the [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze]]. The apses are decorated on the outside with various sculptural decorations, including 74 small Renaissance portraits immortalising important contemporaries and figures who had for some reason particularly impressed the architect or that he deemed to tight to help foot the bill for the cathedral's construction.&lt;ref&gt;Robin McKelvie, Jenny McKelvie, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MAxGSGHvN1AC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=Cathedral+of+St.+James,+%C5%A0ibenik&amp;hl=cs&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Croatia: Globetrotter Travel Guide''], pg. 103, New Holland Publishers Ltd (2006), {{ISBN|1-84537-062-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extension of the line from the main entrance to the Lion Gate shows towards the [[Split Cathedral]]. Giorgio worked probably on the cathedral up to his death in 1475 and certainly until 1473.&lt;ref name="Naprijed"&gt;Naklada Naprijed, ''The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide'', pgs. 198/200, Zagreb (1999), {{ISBN|953-178-097-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inside the Cathedral==
[[Image:St James cathedral interior2.jpg|thumb|left|140px|View of the High altar]]
Inside the cathedral there are four large, evenly matched columns on which the dome rests. The builder decorated the capitals and came to arrangements with the nobles who were to finance the building of chapels, on condition that they would be free to choose their own builders. In the first chapel on the right-side, there is the [[sarcophagus]] of the bishop, humanist and writer [[Juraj Šižgorić]] (1420-1509) which is the work of [[Andrija Aleši]] based on a design by Juraj Dalmatinac. Aleši also created the statue of St. Elijah which stands behind the bishop's throne.&lt;ref name="Naprijed"/&gt; On the left-hand side is the sarcophagus of Bishop Ivan Štafilič, during whose life the cathedral was completed. Beneath the choir there are the graves of two bishops, with reliefs: on the right Bishop Calegari and on the left, Bishop Spingarola. The latter is the work of the local artist Antun Nogulovič.

Opposite the famous Altar of the Holy Cross (Sveti Križ) made by Juraj Čulinovič (Giorgio Schiavone) is buried (1433 or 1446-1505). On the altar there is a painting by Felipe Zaniberti. Amongst other altars to the left of the entrance is the Altar of the Holy Three Kings with a painting by Bernardo Rizzardi, according to the ground plan of Juraj Dalmatinac (see above). The fragments of the mosaic of the Holy Three Kings in St. Mark's Basilica in Venice are now in the Museo Marciano in Venice. The sides of the altar are decorated with reliefs of two angels holding the scroll of Nikola Firentinac, set into shell-shaped niches. The Cathedral Treasury includes works by the Renaissance master Horacije Fortezza of Šibenik (1530-1596), an exceptional goldsmith and miniaturist.

After Fiorentino died in 1505, the construction was finally completed in 1536 by two other craftsmen, Bartolmeo of Mestra and his son Jacob, completely following Nicholas' instructions. The cathedral officially became consecrated in 1555 after a multitude of [[Venice|Venetian]] and local craftsmen had worked on it, in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. Most of the restoration was done between 1850 and 1860 and subsequently between 1992 and 1997.&lt;ref name="Naprijed"/&gt;

The dome of the church was heavily damaged by the [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]]-supported Serb forces during the [[Battle of Šibenik|shelling of Šibenik]] in September 1991. Within years it was quickly repaired with no damage visible. This cathedral has no bell-tower. A tower on the adjoining city walls served this purpose.
