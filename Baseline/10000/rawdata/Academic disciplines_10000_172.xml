'''Amusia''' is a [[music-specific disorders|musical disorder]] that appears mainly as a defect in processing [[pitch (music)|pitch]] but also encompasses musical memory and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pearce J. M. S. | year = 2005 | title = Selected observations on amusia." [Article] | url = | journal = European Neurology | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 145–48 | doi=10.1159/000089606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two main classifications of amusia exist: acquired amusia, which occurs as a result of [[brain damage]], and congenital amusia, which results from a music-processing anomaly present since birth.

Studies have shown that congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination and that 4% of the population suffers from this disorder.&lt;ref name=Insights&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz I., Hyde K. L. | year = 2003 | title = What is specific to music processing? Insights from congenital amusia."

Patients with brain damage may experience the loss of ability to produce musical sounds while sparing [[speech]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz I., Zatorre R. | year = 2005 | title =  Brain Organization for Music Processing| url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 89–114 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070225| pmid = 15709930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; much like [[aphasia|aphasics]] lose speech selectively but can sometimes still [[singing|sing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hébert S., Racette A., Gagnon L., Peretz I. | year = 2003 | title = Revisiting the dissociation between singing and speaking in expressive aphasia | url = http://www.brams.umontreal.ca/plab/publications/articles | journal = Brain | volume = 126 | issue = 8 | pages = 1838–50 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awg186 | pmid = 12821526 | access-date = 17 June 2009 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120721222425/http://www.brams.umontreal.ca/plab/publications/articles | archive-date = 21 July 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorgueille, C. 1966. Introduction à l'étude des amusies.
Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Université de la Sorbonne, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of amusia may affect specific sub-processes of music processing. Current research has demonstrated [[dissociation (neuropsychology)|dissociations]] between [[rhythm]], [[melody]], and emotional processing of music,&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Oliver. (2007). ''Musicophilia'', New York: Random House. pp. 3–17, 187–258, 302–03.&lt;/ref&gt; and amusia may include impairment of any combination of these skill sets.

==Basics of music processing==
Neurologically intact individuals appear to be born musical. Even before they are able to talk, infants show remarkable musical abilities that are similar to those of adults in that they are sensitive to [[musical scale]]s and a regular [[tempo]].&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Also, infants are able to differentiate between [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant and dissonant]] intervals. These perceptual skills indicate that music-specific predispositions exist.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt;

Prolonged exposure to music develops and refines these skills. Extensive musical training does not seem to be necessary in the processing of [[Chord (music)|chords]] and [[key (music)|keys]].&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; The development of musical competence most likely depends on the encoding of pitch along musical scales and maintaining a regular [[pulse (music)|pulse]], both of which are key components in the structure of music and aid in perception, memory, and performance.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Also, the encoding of pitch and temporal regularity are both likely to be specialized for music processing.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Pitch perception is absolutely crucial to processing music. The use of scales and the organization of scale tones around a central tone (called the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]) assign particular importance to notes in the scale and cause non-scale notes to sound out of place. This enables the listener to ascertain when a wrong note is played. However, in individuals with amusia, this ability is either compromised or lost entirely.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt;

Music-specific neural networks exist in the brain for a variety of music-related tasks. It has been shown that [[Broca's area]] is involved in the processing of musical syntax.&lt;ref&gt;Burkhard Maess, Stefan Koelsch, Thomas C. Gunter and Angela D. Friederici. "Musical syntax is processed in Broca’s area: an MEG study" (2001) ''Nature Publishing Group''.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, brain damage can disrupt an individual's ability to tell the difference between [[tonality|tonal]] and [[atonality|atonal]] music and detect the presence of wrong notes, but can preserve the individual's ability to assess the distance between pitches and the direction of the pitch.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; The opposite scenario can also occur, in which the individual loses pitch discrimination capabilities, but can sense and appreciate the tonal context of the work. Distinct neural networks also exist for music memories, singing, and music recognition. Neural networks for music recognition are particularly intriguing. A patient can undergo brain damage that renders them unable to recognize familiar melodies that are presented without words. However, the patient maintains the ability to recognize spoken lyrics or words, familiar voices, and environmental sounds.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; The reverse case is also possible, in which the patient cannot recognize spoken words, but can still recognize familiar melodies. These situations overturn previous claims that speech recognition and music recognition share a single processing system.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Instead, it is clear that there are at least two distinct processing modules: one for speech and one for music.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt;

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of amusia are generally categorized as receptive, clinical, or mixed. Symptoms of receptive amusia, sometimes referred to as "musical deafness", include the inability to recognize familiar [[melodies]], the loss of ability to read [[musical notation]], and the inability to detect wrong or out-of tune notes.&lt;ref name=Neuroanatomy&gt;http://amusia-brain.blogspot.com/2008/02/definition_25.html Hutchings, Tiffany, Seth Hayden, Mandy Politziner, and Erina Kainuma. "Amusia." Web log post. Amusia: Definition, Welcome to Amusia..., Congenital and Acquired Amusia, Neural Overview. 25 Feb. 2008. Web. 10 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical, or expressive, symptoms include the loss of ability to sing, write [[musical notation]], and/or play an instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bautista R., Ciampetti M. | year = 2003 | title = Expressive Aprosody and Amusia as a Manifestation of Right Hemisphere Seizures | url = | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 466–67 | doi=10.1046/j.1528-1157.2003.36502.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mixed disorder would be a combination of expressive and receptive impairment.

Clinical symptoms of acquired amusia are much more variable than those of congenital amusia and are determined by the location and nature of the lesion.&lt;ref name=Neuroanatomy/&gt; Brain injuries may afflict motor or expressive functioning, including the ability to sing, whistle, or hum a tune (oral-expressive amusia), the ability to play an instrument (instrumental amusia or musical apraxia), and the ability to write music (musical agraphia). Additionally, brain damage to the receptive dimension affects the faculty to discriminate tunes (receptive or sensorial amusia), the ability to read music (musical alessia), and the ability to identify songs that were familiar prior to the brain damage (amnesic amusia).

Research suggests that patients with amusia also have difficulty when it comes to spatial processing.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal | author = Douglas K. M., Bilkey D.K. | year = 2007 | title = Amusia is Associated with Deficits in Spatial Processing | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 7| pages = 915–21 | doi=10.1038/nn1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amusics performed more quickly than normal individuals on a combined task of both spatial and musical processing tasks, which is most likely due to their deficit. Normal individuals experience interference due to their intact processing of both musical and spatial tasks, while amusics do not.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; Pitch processing normally depends on the cognitive mechanisms that are usually used to process spatial representations.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;

Those with congenital amusia show impaired performance on discrimination, identification and imitation of sentences with [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonational]] differences in pitch direction in their final word. This suggests that amusia can in subtle ways impair language processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Liu F, Patel AD, Fourcin A, Stewart L | year = 2010 | title = Intonation processing in congenital amusia: discrimination, identification and imitation | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 133 | issue = 6| pages = 1682–93 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awq089 | pmid = 20418275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of amusia requires individuals to detect out-of-key notes in conventional but unfamiliar melodies.&lt;ref name=Diagnosis&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz Isabelle, Brattico Elvira, Järvenpa Miika, Tervaniemi Mari | year = 2009| title = The amusic brain: in tune, out of key, and unaware | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 5 | issue = 5| page = 1277 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awp055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A behavioral failure on this test is diagnostic because there is typically no overlap between the distributions of the scores of amusics and controls.&lt;ref name=Music-specific&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayotte J., Peretz I., Hyde K. | year = 2002 | title = Congenital amusia – A group study of adults afflicted with a music-specific disorder." [Article] | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 125 | issue = Pt 2| pages = 238–51 | doi=10.1093/brain/awf028 | pmid=11844725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such scores are generally obtained through the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz I, Champod AS, Hyde KL | year = 2003 | title = Varieties of musical disorders. The Montreal battery of evaluation of amusia | doi = 10.1196/annals.1284.006 | pmid = 14681118 | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 999 | issue = | pages = 58–75 | bibcode = 2003NYASA.999...58P }}&lt;/ref&gt; which involves a series of tests that evaluate the use of musical characteristics known to contribute to the memory and perception of conventional music.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz I., Ayotte J., Zatorre R.

''et al.'' | year = 2002 | title = Congenital amusia: A disorder of fine-grained pitch discrimination. | doi = 10.1016/s0896-6273(01)00580-3| journal = Neuron | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 185–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The battery comprises six subtests which assess the ability to discriminate [[pitch contour]], musical scales, pitch [[interval (music)|intervals]], rhythm, [[meter (music)|meter]], and memory.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; An individual is considered amusic if they perform two [[standard deviations]] below the mean obtained by musically-competent controls. This musical pitch disorder represents a phenotype that serves to identify the associated neuro-genetic factors.&lt;ref name=Family&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz I., Cummings S., Dube M. P. | year = 2007 | title = The genetics of congenital amusia (tone deafness): A family-aggregation study." [Article] | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 582–88 | doi=10.1086/521337}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both MRI-based brain structural analyses and electroencephalography (EEG) are common methods employed to uncover brain anomalies associated with amusia (See [[Neuroanatomy]]).&lt;ref name=Diagnosis/&gt; Additionally, [[voxel-based morphometry]] (VBM) is used to detect anatomical differences between the MRIs of amusic brains and musically intact brains, specifically with respect increased and/or decreased amounts of white and grey matter.&lt;ref name=Diagnosis/&gt;

==Classifications==
There are two general classifications of amusia: congenital amusia and acquired amusia.

===Congenital amusia===
'''Congenital amusia''', commonly known as '''tone deafness''',&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; refers to a musical disability that cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, cognitive defects, or lack of environmental stimulation,&lt;ref name="Fine-grained"/&gt; and it affects about 4% of the population.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Individuals who suffer from congenital amusia seem to lack the musical predispositions with which most people are born.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyde K. L., Peretz I. | year = 2004 | title = Brains that are out of tune but in time." [Article] | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 356–60 | doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00683.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are unable to recognize or hum familiar tunes even if they have normal [[audiometry]] and above-average intellectual and memory skills. Also, they do not show sensitivity to dissonant chords in a melodic context, which, as discussed earlier, is one of the musical predispositions exhibited by infants. The hallmark of congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination, and this deficit is most apparent when congenital amusics are asked to pick out a wrong note in a given melody.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; If the distance between two successive pitches is small, congenital amusics are not able to detect a pitch change. As a result of this defect in pitch perception, a lifelong musical impairment may emerge due to a failure to internalize musical scales. A lack of fine-grained pitch discrimination makes it extremely difficult for amusics to enjoy and appreciate music, which consists largely of small pitch changes.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

Tone-deaf people seem to be disabled only when it comes to music as they can fully interpret the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] of human speech.  Tone deafness has a strong negative [[correlation]] with belonging to societies with [[tonal language]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} This could be evidence that the ability to reproduce and distinguish between notes may be a learned skill; conversely, it may suggest that the genetic predisposition towards accurate pitch discrimination may influence the linguistic development of a population towards tonality. A correlation between [[allele frequencies]] and linguistic typological features has been recently discovered, supporting the latter hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dediu |first=Dan |author2=D. Robert Ladd |title=Linguistic tone is related to the population frequency of the adaptive haplogroups of two brain size genes, ASPM and Microcephalin |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=104 |issue=26 |pages=10944–49 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17537923 |pmc=1904158 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0610848104 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/26/10944 |accessdate=18 July 2008|bibcode=2007PNAS..10410944D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tone deafness is also associated with other musical-specific impairments such as the inability to keep time with music ([[beat deafness]], or the lack of [[rhythm]]), or the inability to remember or recognize a song. These disabilities can appear separately, but some research shows that they are more likely to appear in tone-deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Julie |last=Ayotte |author2=Isabelle Peretz |author3=Krista Hyde |title=Congenital amusia: a group study of adults afflicted with a music-specific disorder |journal=[[Brain (journal)|Brain]] |volume=125 |issue=2 |pages=238–51 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11844725 |doi=10.1093/brain/awf028 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/125/2/238 |accessdate=18 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experienced musicians, such as [[W. A. Mathieu]], have addressed tone deafness in adults as correctable with training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mathieu |first=W. A. |title=Tone-Deaf Choir |url=http://ListeningBookAudio.com/tonedeaf.htm |accessdate=26 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquired amusia===
'''Acquired amusia''' is a musical disability that shares the same characteristics as congenital amusia, but rather than being inherited, it is the result of brain damage.&lt;ref name= Stroke&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sarkamo T., Tervaniemi M., Soinila S., Autti T., Silvennoinen H. M., Laine M. ''et al.'' | year = 2009 | title = Cognitive deficits associated with acquired amusia after stroke: A neuropsychological follow-up study." [Article] | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 47 | issue = 12| pages = 2642–2651 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.05.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also more common than congenital amusia.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; While it has been suggested that music is processed by music-specific neural networks in the brain, this view has been broadened to show that music processing also encompasses generic cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and executive processes.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; A recent study was conducted to investigate the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie acquired amusia and contribute to its recovery.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; The study was performed on 53 stroke patients with a left or right hemisphere [[middle cerebral artery]] (MCA) infarction one week, three months, and six months after the stroke occurred.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; Amusic subjects were identified one week following their stroke, and over the course of the study, amusics and non-amusics were compared in both brain lesion location and their performances on neuropsychological tests.

Results showed that there was no significant difference in the distribution of left and right hemisphere lesions between amusic and non-amusic groups, but that the amusic group had a significantly higher number of lesions to the [[frontal lobe]] and [[auditory cortex]].&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; [[Temporal lobe]] lesions were also observed in patients with amusia.  Amusia is a common occurrence following an [[ischemic]] MCA stroke, as evidenced by the 60% of patients who were found to be amusic at the one-week post-stroke stage.&lt;ref name= Stroke/&gt; While significant recovery takes place over time, amusia can persist for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; Test results suggest that acquired amusia and its recovery in the post-stroke stage are associated with a variety of cognitive functions, particularly attention, executive functioning, and working memory.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt;

==Neuroanatomy==
{{Infobox medical condition |Name=Music Processing and the Brain |Image= |Alt=A diagram showing the different sections of the brain and how they relate to music processing. |Caption=An image depicting the different sections of the brain and specific areas that relate to music processing in particular.}}

===Overview===
Many research studies of individuals with amusia show that a number of cortical regions appear to be involved in processing music. Some report that the [[primary auditory cortex]], secondary auditory cortex, and [[limbic system]] are responsible for this faculty, while more recent studies suggest that lesions in other cortical areas, abnormalities in cortical thickness, and deficiency in neural connectivity and brain plasticity may contribute to amusia. While various causes of amusia exist, some general findings that provide insight to the brain mechanisms involved in music processing are discussed below.&lt;ref name=Neuroanatomy/&gt;

===Pitch relations===
Studies suggest that the analysis of pitch is primarily controlled by the right temporal region of the brain. The right secondary auditory cortex processes pitch change and manipulation of fine tunes; specifically, this region distinguishes the multiple pitches that characterize melodic tunes as [[Pitch contour|contour]] (pitch direction) and interval (frequency ratio between successive notes) information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zatorre R.J., Berlin P. | year = 2001 | title = Spectral and temporal processing in human auditory cortex | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 11 | issue = 10| pages = 946–53 | doi=10.1093/cercor/11.10.946}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right superior temporal gyrus recruits and evaluates contour information, while both right and left temporal regions recruit and evaluate interval information.&lt;ref name=Agnosia&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayotte J., Peretz I., Rousseau I., Bard C., Bojanowski M. | year = 2000 | title = Patterns of music agnosia associated with middle cerebral artery infarcts | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 123 | issue = 9| pages = 1926–38 | doi=10.1093/brain/123.9.1926 | pmid=10960056}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the right anterolateral part of Heschl's gyrus (primary auditory cortex) is also concerned with processing pitch information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tramo M., Shah G.D., Braida L.D. | year = 2002 | title = Functional role of auditory cortex in frequency processing and pitch perception | url = | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 122–39 | doi=10.1152/jn.00104.1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporal relations===
The brain analyzes the temporal (rhythmic) components of music in two ways: (1) it segments the ongoing sequences of music into temporal events based on duration, and (2) it groups those temporal events to understand the underlying beat to music. Studies on rhythmic discrimination reveal that the right temporal auditory cortex is responsible for temporal segmenting, and the left temporal auditory cortex is responsible for temporal grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Di Pietro M., Laganaro M., Leeman B., Schnider A. | year = 2004 | title = Receptive amusia: temporal auditory deficit in a processional musician following a left temporo-parietal lesion | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 42 | issue = 7| pages = 868–977 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2003.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wilson S.J., Pressing J., Wales R.J. | year = 2002 | title = Modeling rhythmic function in a musician post-stroke | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 40 | issue = 8| pages = 1494–505 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(01)00198-1 | pmid=11931954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies suggest the participation of motor cortical areas in rhythm perception and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Halsband U., Tanji J. Feund | year = 1993 | title = The role of premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area in the temporal control of movement in man | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 116 | issue = | pages = 243–46 | doi=10.1093/brain/116.1.243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a lack of involvement and networking between bilateral temporal cortices and neural motor centers may contribute to both congenital and acquired amusia.&lt;ref name= Neuroanatomy/&gt;

===Memory===
Memory is required in order to process and integrate both melodic and rhythmic aspects of music. Studies suggest that there is a rich interconnection between the right temporal gyrus and frontal cortical areas for working memory in music appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zatorre R.J., Samson S. | year = 1991 | title = Role of the right temporal neocortex in retention of pitch in auditory short-term memory | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 114 | issue = 6| pages = 2403–17 | doi=10.1093/brain/114.6.2403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaab, N., Gaser, C., Zaehle, T., Jancke, L., Schlaug, G. (2003). Functional anatomy of pitch memory-an fMRI study with sparse temoral sampling. NeuroLmage. 19:1417-1426.&lt;/ref&gt; This connection between the temporal and frontal regions of the brain is extremely important since these regions play critical roles in music processing. Changes in the temporal areas of the amusic brain are most likely associated with deficits in pitch perception and other musical characteristics, while changes in the frontal areas are potentially related to deficits in cognitive processing aspects, such as memory, that are needed for musical discrimination tasks.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; Memory is also concerned with the recognition and internal representation of tunes, which help to identify familiar songs and confer the ability to sing tunes in one's head. The activation of the superior temporal region and left inferior temporal and frontal areas is responsible for the recognition of familiar songs,&lt;ref name=Agnosia/&gt; and the right auditory cortex (a perceptual mechanism) is involved in the internal representation of tunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zatorre R.J., Halpern R. | year = 1993 | title = Effect of unilateral temporal-lobe excision on percention and imagery of songs | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 221–32 | doi=10.1016/0028-3932(93)90086-f| pmid = 8492875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that any abnormalities and/or injuries to these regions of the brain could facilitate amusia.

===Other regions of the brain possibly linked to amusia===
* Lesions (or the absence of) in associations between the right temporal lobe and inferior frontal lobe. In nine of ten tone-deaf people, the superior [[arcuate fasciculus]] in the right hemisphere could not be detected, suggesting a disconnection between the posterior superior temporal gyrus and the posterior inferior frontal gyrus. Researchers suggested the posterior superior temporal gyrus was the origin of the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loui | first1 = P. | last2 = Alsop | first2 = D. | last3 = Schlaug | first3 = S. | year = 2009 | title = Tone Deafness: A New Disconnection Syndrome? | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 29 | issue = 33| pages = 10215–120 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1701-09.2009 | pmid=19692596 | pmc=2747525}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cortical thickness and reduced [[white matter]] – in a recent study, [[voxel-based morphometry]], an imaging technique used to explore structural differences in the brain, revealed a decrease in white matter concentration in the right [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of amusic individuals as compared to controls.&lt;ref name=Morphometry&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyde K.

==Discovery==
In 1825, [[Franz Joseph Gall|F. Gall]] mentioned a "musical organ" in a specific region of the human brain that could be spared or disrupted after a traumatic event resulting in brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=000206851. Alossa, Nicoletta; Castelli, Lorys, "Amusia and Musical Functioning", ''Eur Neurol'', Vol. 61, No. 5, pp. 269–77 (2009)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713135718/http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=000206851. |date=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, [[Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud]] described the first series of cases that involved the loss of music abilities that were due to brain injury. Later, during the late nineteenth-century, several influential neurologists studied language in an attempt to construct a [[theory of cognitive development|theory of cognition]]. While not studied as thoroughly as language, music and visual processing were also studied. In 1888–1890, [[August Knoblauch]] produced a cognitive model for music processing and termed it amusia. This model for music processing was the earliest produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0278-2626(02)00527-4 | volume=51 | title=August Knoblauch and amusia: A nineteenth-century cognitive model of music | journal=Brain and Cognition | pages=102–14 | year=2003 | author=Johnson Julene K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

===First documented case of congenital amusia===
While the possibility that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits is not a new notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; The study was conducted with a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, nor did she have any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard intelligence test, and her working memory was evaluated and found to be normal. However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, it sounds like noise and evokes a stressful response.

In order to determine if Monica's disorder is amusia, she was subjected to the MBEA series of tests. One of the tests dealt with Monica's difficulties in discriminating pitch variations in sequential notes. In this test, a pair of melodies was played, and Monica was asked if the second melody in the pair contained a wrong note.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Monica's score on this test was well below the average score generated by the control group.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Further tests showed that Monica struggles with recognizing highly familiar melodies, but that she has no problems in recognizing the voices of well-known speakers. Thus, it appears that Monica's deficit seems limited to music.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; A later study showed that not only do amusics experience difficulty in discriminating variations in pitch, but they also exhibit deficits in perceiving patterns in pitch.&lt;ref name=Tone-deaf&gt;{{cite journal | author = Foxton J. M., Dean J. L., Gee R., Peretz I., Griffiths T. D. | year = 2004 | title = Characterization of deficits in pitch perception underlying 'tone deafness'." [Article] | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 127 | issue = 4| pages = 801–10 | doi=10.1093/brain/awh105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This finding led to another test that was designed to assess the presence of a deficiency in pitch perception.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; In this test, Monica heard a sequence of five piano tones of constant pitch followed by a comparison sequence of five piano tones in which the fourth tone could be the same pitch as the other notes in the sequence or a completely different pitch altogether. Monica was asked to respond "yes" if she detected a pitch change on the fourth tone or respond "no" if she could not detect a pitch change.  Results show that Monica could barely detect a pitch change as large as two [[semitone]]s ([[whole tone]]), or half steps.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; While this pitch-processing deficit is extremely severe, it does not seem to include speech intonation.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; This is because pitch variations in speech are very coarse compared with those used in music.&lt;ref name= Insights/&gt; In conclusion, Monica's learning disability arises from a basic problem in pitch discrimination, which is viewed as the origin of congenital amusia.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt;

===Family aggregation study===
Another interesting question posed about congenital amusia is if it has a genetic origin.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; A study was conducted to test for the presence of a genetic origin by studying family aggregation of congenital amusia.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; Family members of amusics were studied, as well as family members of a control group. The study yielded interesting results. Amusia cannot be attributed solely to family environment due to the presence of at least one unaffected sibling in each tested family in the amusic group.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; Also, music was found to be present to a lesser extent, but not absent, in the environment of the amusic subjects than in that of the musically intact control group.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; This supports the claim that the occurrence of congenital amusia cannot be explained by a lack of environmental stimulation. Another interesting finding was that the next generation, or the offspring of those with congenital amusia, was more musical.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; A reason for this might be that musical stimulation for the offspring probably started early in life when their brains were more plastic.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt;

Overall, test results support the view that congenital amusia is hereditary.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; It is likely to be influenced by several genes that interact to increase an individual's susceptibility to its development.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; However, the fact that the offspring have a lower risk of developing congenital amusia shows that it can be less prevalent when the musical environment is enriched.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; This stresses the importance that experience-dependent tuning has in the musical pitch system.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt;

===Singing in congenital amusia===
While it is known that congenital amusia is a disorder characterized by poor pitch perception, a recent study sought to discover to what extent this pitch deficit may compromise singing.&lt;ref name=Singing&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bella S. D., Giguere J. F., Peretz I. | year = 2009 | title = Singing in congenital amusia | doi = 10.1121/1.3132504 | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 126 | issue = 1| pages = 414–24 | bibcode = 2009ASAJ..126..414D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, eleven amusic individuals and eleven controls were asked to sing a familiar song using the lyrics first, and then using the syllable "la". Results showed that individuals with congenital amusia were poor singers.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; They could not maintain a stable pitch, nor could they sing the correct pitch intervals that were written in the music. However, many of the amusic testing subjects were able to sing with the correct rhythm.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; The results confirmed that the amusics' ability to detect pitch changes influences their level of singing proficiency.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; The subjects who struggled the most with pitch perception were the most unstable in producing the correct pitch and made several pitch interval and contour errors. However, there were some remarkable exceptions. A couple of amusic individuals were able to sing proficiently despite extremely impaired pitch perception.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt;

The results of singing with the lyrics and singing on the syllable "la" can also be compared. Although most of the amusic subjects struggled with maintaining the correct pitch when singing with lyrics, they were able to complete the task. However, when singing the same song on the syllable "la", more than half of the amusic subjects could only sing a few notes.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; This is due to a poor memory of the musical component of songs.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; Overall, it was concluded that singing deficiency in amusic individuals might be a result of their pitch perception deficit.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; However, the existence of amusic individuals who are able to sing proficiently suggests that there may be separate neural pathways for auditory perception and action.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt;

==Related diseases==

{{Main article|Music-specific disorders}}

Amusia has recently been classified as a learning disability that affects musical abilities.&lt;ref name=Congenital&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayotte Julie, Peretz Isabelle, Hyde Krista | year = 2002 | title = Congenital Amusia | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 125 | issue = 2| pages = 238–51 | doi=10.1093/brain/awf028 | pmid=11844725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that in congenital amusia, younger subjects can be taught tone differentiation techniques. This finding leads researchers to believe that amusia is related to [[dyslexia]] and other similar disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz Isabelle, Brattico Elvira, Tervaniemi Mari | year = 2002 | title = Abnormal Electrical Brain Responses to Pitch in Congenital Amusia | url = http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Brain-Patterns-In-Amusia-May-Be-Related-To-Other-Disorders-4751-1/ | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 478–82| doi = 10.1002/ana.20606 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has been shown that amusia may be related to an increase in size of the [[cerebral cortex]], which may be a result of a malformation in cortical development. Diseases such as dyslexia and [[epilepsy]] are due to a malformation in cortical development and also lead to an increase in cortical thickness, which leads researchers to believe that congenital amusia may be caused by the identical phenomenon in a different area of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyde Krista, Lerch Jason, Zatorre Robert J | year = 2007| title = Cortical Thickness in Congenital Amusia: When Less Is Better Than More. | url = | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = 47| pages = 13028–32 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.3039-07.2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amusia is also similar to [[aphasia]] in that they affect similar areas of the [[human brain|brain]] near the [[temporal lobe]]. Most cases of those with amusia do not show any symptoms of aphasia. However, a number of cases have shown that those who have aphasia can exhibit symptoms of amusia, especially in acquired aphasia. The two are not mutually exclusive and having one does not imply possession of the other.&lt;ref name=Congenital/&gt; In acquired amusia, inability to perceive music correlates with an inability to perform other higher-level functions. As musical ability improves, so too do the higher cognitive functions which suggests that musical ability is closely related to these higher-level functions, such as [[memory]] and [[learning]], mental flexibility, and semantic fluency.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt;

Amusia can also be related to [[aprosody]], a disorder in which the sufferer's speech is affected, becoming extremely monotonous. It has been found that both amusia and aprosody can arise from seizures occurring in the non-dominant hemisphere.&lt;ref name=aprosody&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bautista R.E., Ciampetti M.Z. | year = 2003 | title = Expressive Aprosody and Amusia as a Manifestation of Right Hemisphere Seizures | url = | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 466–67 | doi=10.1046/j.1528-1157.2003.36502.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also both arise from lesions to the brain, as can Broca's aphasia come about simultaneously with amusia from injury.&lt;ref name=aprosody/&gt; There is a relation between musical abilities and the components of speech, however, they are not understood very well.&lt;ref name=aprosody/&gt;

==Social and emotional impact==
Other than their inability to hear music, which is most likely due to a [[genetic disorder|genetic defect]], the rest of an amusic's brain remains normal. The only effect is on the ability to tell different notes apart due to the separation of two key areas in the brain. Most sufferers of amusia describe music as unpleasant. Others simply refer to it as noise and find it annoying. This can have social implications because amusics often try to avoid music, which in many social situations is not an option. In China and other countries in which identical words have different meanings based on pitch, amusia may have a much more pronounced social and emotional impact: difficulty in speaking and understanding the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/2005_BBC_Music_Magazine.pdf Stewart, Lauren, "Pitch Fever", BBC Music Magazine, pp. 36–38, (October 2005)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406231451/http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/2005_BBC_Music_Magazine.pdf |date=April 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Currently, no forms of treatment have proven effective in treating amusia. One study has shown tone differentiation techniques to have some success, however future research on treatment of this disorder will be necessary to verify this technique as an appropriate treatment.&lt;ref name=Congenital/&gt;

==Future research==
Over the past decade, much has been discovered about amusia. However, there remains a great deal more to learn. While a method of treatment for people with amusia has not been defined, tone differentiation techniques have been used on amusic patients with some success. It was found with this research that children reacted positively to these tone differentiation techniques, while adults found the training annoying.&lt;ref name=Congenital/&gt; However, further research in this direction would aid in determining if this would be a viable treatment option for people with amusia. Additional research can also serve to indicate which processing component in the brain is essential for normal music development.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Also, it would be extremely beneficial to investigate musical learning in relation to amusia since this could provide valuable insights into other forms of learning disabilities such as [[dysphasia]] and dyslexia.&lt;ref name=Music-specific/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt;

'''Aperture synthesis''' or '''synthesis imaging''' is a type of [[interferometry]] that mixes signals from a collection of telescopes to produce images having the same [[angular resolution]] as an instrument the size of the entire collection. At each separation and orientation, the lobe-pattern of the interferometer produces an output which is one component of the [[Fourier transform]] of the spatial distribution of the brightness of the observed object. The image (or "map") of the source is produced from these measurements. [[Astronomical interferometer]]s are commonly used for high-resolution [[optical astronomy|optical]], [[infrared astronomy|infrared]], [[submillimetre astronomy|submillimetre]] and [[radio astronomy]] observations.

== Technical issues ==
Aperture synthesis is possible only if both the [[amplitude]] and the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the incoming signal are measured by each telescope. For radio frequencies, this is possible by electronics, while for optical frequencies, the electromagnetic field cannot be measured directly and correlated in software, but must be propagated by sensitive optics and interfered optically. Accurate optical delay and atmospheric wavefront aberration correction is required, a very demanding technology that became possible only in the 1990s. This is why imaging with aperture synthesis has been used successfully in radio astronomy since the 1950s and in optical/infrared astronomy only since the turn of the millennium. See [[astronomical interferometer]] for more information.

In order to produce a high quality image, a large number of different separations between different telescopes is required (the projected separation between any two telescopes as seen from the radio source is called a baseline) - as many different baselines as possible are required in order to get a good quality image. The number of baselines (n&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) for an array of n telescopes is given by n&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;=(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-&amp;nbsp;n)/2.  For example, the [[Very Large Array]] has 27 telescopes giving 351 independent baselines at once, and can give high quality images.

== Differences ==
[[Image:Earth rotation aperture synthesis.jpg|thumb|300px|Most aperture synthesis interferometers use the rotation of the Earth to increase the number of baseline orientations included in an observation. In this example with the Earth represented as a grey sphere, the baseline between telescope A and telescope B changes angle with time as viewed from the radio source as the Earth rotates. Taking data at different times thus provides measurements with different telescope separations.]]
In contrast to radio arrays, the largest optical arrays currently have only 6 telescopes, giving poorer image quality from the 15 baselines between the telescopes. Most aperture synthesis interferometers use the rotation of the Earth to increase the number of different baselines included in an observation (see diagram on right).

Taking data at different times provides measurements with different telescope separations and angles without the need for buying additional telescopes or moving the telescopes manually, as the rotation of the Earth moves the telescopes to new baselines.

The use of Earth rotation was discussed in detail in the 1950 paper [http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1950MNRAS.110..508R&amp;amp;db_key=AST A preliminary survey of the radio stars in the Northern Hemisphere]. Some instruments use artificial rotation of the interferometer array instead of Earth rotation, such as in [[Aperture Masking Interferometry|aperture masking interferometry]].

Aperture synthesis imaging was first developed at radio wavelengths by [[Martin Ryle]] and coworkers from the [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group|Radio Astronomy Group]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. Martin Ryle and [[Antony Hewish|Tony Hewish]] jointly received a [[Nobel Prize]] for this and other contributions to the development of radio interferometry.

The radio astronomy group in Cambridge went on to found the [[Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory]] near Cambridge in the 1950s. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, as computers (such as the [[Titan (computer)|Titan]]) became capable of handling the computationally intensive Fourier transform inversions required, they used aperture synthesis to create a 'One-Mile' and later a '5&amp;nbsp;km' effective aperture using the [[One-Mile Telescope|One-Mile]] and [[Ryle Telescope|Ryle]] telescopes, respectively.

The technique was subsequently further developed in [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]] to obtain baselines of thousands of kilometres.  Aperture synthesis is also used by a type of [[radar]] system known as [[synthetic aperture radar]], and even in [[optical interferometry|optical telescopes]].

Originally it was thought necessary to make measurements at essentially every baseline length and orientation out to some maximum: such a [[sampling theorem|fully sampled]] Fourier transform formally contains the information exactly equivalent to the image from a conventional telescope with an aperture diameter equal to the maximum baseline, hence the name ''aperture synthesis''.

It was rapidly discovered that in many cases useful images could be made with a relatively sparse and irregular set of baselines, especially with the help of non-linear [[deconvolution]] algorithms such as the [[maximum entropy method]]. The alternative name ''synthesis imaging'' acknowledges the shift in emphasis from trying to synthesise the complete aperture (allowing image reconstruction by Fourier transform) to trying to synthesise the image from whatever data is available, using powerful but computationally expensive algorithms.

'''Bilingual education''' involves teaching academic content in two languages, in a native and secondary language with varying amounts of each language used in accordance with the program model.Bilingual education refers to the utilization of two languages as means of instruction for students and considered part of or the entire school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/curriculum_handbook/413/chapters/Bilingual_Education@_Effective_Programming_for_Language-Minority_Students.aspx|title=Bilingual Education: Effective Programming for Language-Minority Students|last=ASCD|website=ascd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilingual education program models==
The following are several different types of bilingual education program models:
*[[Transitional bilingual education|Transitional Bilingual Education]]. This involves education in a child's native language, typically for no more than three years, to ensure that students do not fall behind in content areas like mathematics, science, and social studies while they are learning English. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later. The goal is to help students transition to mainstream, English-only classrooms as quickly as possible, and the linguistic goal of such programs is English acquisition only. In a transitional bilingual program, the student's primary language is used as a vehicle to develop literacy skills and acquire academic knowledge. It is used to develop literacy and academic skills in the primary language
* '''Two-Way''' or '''Dual Language Immersion''' Bilingual Education. Dual Language or Two-Way Immersion education refers to programs that provide grade-level content and literacy instruction to all students through two languages, English and a partner language. These programs are designed to help native and non-native English speakers become bilingual and biliterate. There are four main types of dual language programs, these programs refer to how a student would best learn with Dual Language Immersion based on their previous language skills.
**'''Developmental, or maintenance bilingual programs.''' These programs enroll students who are native speakers of the partner language to learn English.
**'''Bilingual immersion programs.''' This program enrolls both native English speaker and native speakers of the partner language.
**'''Foreign language Immersion.''' This program primarily enrolls students who speak English as their native language.
**'''Heritage language programs.''' These programs enroll students who primarily dominant in english, but a close relative (parents, grandparents) speak the partner language.
**There are two basic models for Dual Language Immersion The first model is '''90/10 model'''. The two-way bilingual immersion program has 90% of the instructions in grade K-1 in minority language which is less supported by the broader society and 10% in the majority language . This proportion gradually changes in the majority language until the curriculum is equally divided in both languages by 5th grade.  The two-way bilingual immersion program is based on the principle of clear curriculum separation of the two languages of instruction. Teachers do not repeat or translate the subject matter in second language but strengthen concepts taught in one language across the two languages in a spiral curriculum in order to provide cognitive challenge(Thomas &amp; Collier. 1997). The languages of instructions are alternated by theme or content area.  This type of immersion is required to develop the dual language proficiency, as social language can be mastered in couple of years, but a higher level of competency is required to read social studies texts or solve mathematics word problems, roughly around 5 to 7 years (Collier, 1987). The goal of gradually increasing the majority of the language is for instruction to become 50% of English and 50% of the partner language. The second model is the '''50/50 model'''. In the 50/50 model English and the partner language are used equally throughout the program.

The United States Congress introduced the Bilingual Act in 1968 defining bilingual education’s term program. This program of instruction is intended for children who are not fully proficient in the English language. Instructions are given so pupils can achieve the necessary competence in English as well as their native languages taking into consideration the children’s cultural heritage. This could be integrated into the subjects or courses of study enabling the students to grow effectively throughout the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://education.uslegal.com/bilingualism/landmark-legislation/bilingual-education-act-1968/|title=Bilingual Education Act (1968) – Education|last=Inc.|first=US Legal|website=education.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1968) was another meaningful measure for bilingual education. Title VII (Bilingual Education Act) created federal guidelines for bilingual education. The decree recognized the “''Special educational needs of the large numbers children of limited English-speaking ability in the United States''.” Said Enactment specified the federal government’s obligation to provide subsidy for creative bilingual programs. Title VII was amended many times since its introduction. The decree became part of the America Schools Act in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/transitional-bilingual-education-programs-pros-cons.html|title=Transitional Bilingual Education Programs: Pros &amp; Cons {{!}} Study.com|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual Immersion classrooms encourage students but with the permission it may be enthusiastic &amp;' native language development, making an important contribution to heritage language maintenance and allows language minority students to remain in classrooms with their native English-speaking peers, resulting in linguistic and socio-cultural advantages (Christian, 1996b). As of May 2005, there were 317 dual immersion programs operating in elementary schools in the United States in 10 different languages(Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005).

Dual Language programs are less common in US schools, although research indicates they are extremely effective in helping students learn English well and aiding the long-term performance of English learners in school. Native English speakers benefit by learning a second language. English language learners (ELLs) are not segregated from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;(Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005; Thomas &amp; Collier, 1997; Lindholm-Leary, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; These students are taught in their mother tongue yet still in the typical 'American' classroom they need to be in, for both cognitive and social benefits. 
* Another form of Bilingual Education is a type of '''Dual Language''' program that has students study in two different ways: 1) A variety of academic subjects are taught in the students' second language, with specially trained bilingual teachers who can understand students when they ask questions in their native language, but always answer in the second language; and 2) Native language literacy classes improve students' writing and higher-order language skills in their first language. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later. In this type of program, the native language classes do not teach academic subjects. The second-language classes are content-based, rather than grammar-based, so students learn all of their academic subjects in the second language.&lt;ref name="What is Dual Language Education"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlenm.org/what-is-dual-language-education.aspx|title=What is Dual Language Education?|website=dlenm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dual language is a type of bilingual education where students learn about reading and writing in two languages. In the United States, majority of programs are English and Spanish but new partner languages have emerged lately such as Japanese, Korean, French, Mandarin, and Arabic. The concept of Dual Language promotes bilingualism, improved awareness of cultural diversity, and higher levels of academic achievement by means of lessons in two languages.&lt;ref name="What is Dual Language Education"/&gt; 
* '''Late-Exit''' or '''Developmental''' Bilingual Education. Education is in the child's native language for an extended duration, accompanied by education in English. The goal is to develop literacy in the child's native language first, and transfer these skills to the second language. This education is ideal for many English learning students, but in many instances the resources for such education are not available.

==Myths surrounding bilingual education==
Many myths and much prejudice has grown around bilingual education. Researchers from the UK and Poland have listed the most entrenched misconceptions:&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB, Bator A |title=Perceived effectiveness of language acquisition in the process of multilingual upbringing by parents of different nationalities  |journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism |volume=21  |issue=6  |pages=1–19 |year=2016 |doi=10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* bi- or multilinguals are exceptions to the ‘default’ monolingual ‘norm’;
* in order to deserve the label ‘bi-/multilingual’, one needs to have an equal, ‘perfect’, ‘nativelike’ command of both/all her/his languages;
* childhood bilingualism may be detrimental to both linguistic and cognitive development and consequently lead to poorer results at school;
* exposing a child to more than one tongue may cause language impairment or deficits, or that for children already diagnosed with impairments two languages mean too much unnecessary pressure and effort;
*children do not have enough time to learn both languages, therefore it is better if they only acquire the majority language.

These are all harmful convictions which have long been debunked,&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"/&gt; yet still persist among many parents. It is important to understand what constitutes the decision for sending children to a bilingual school. The decision should be based on, appropriate age, curriculum, and the preference of the child.&lt;ref name="biling"&gt;{{cite web|last=Racoma|first=Bernadine|title=The Pros and Cons of Sending Your Kids to a Bilingual School|url=https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/2014/03/the-pros-and-cons-of-sending-your-kids-to-a-bilingual-school-3924|website=Day Translations|date=2014-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=June 2017|certain=y}}

In spite of these myths surrounding language education, there are numerous significant benefits to a child's development when exposed to secondary language education. The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages has identified over twenty benefits to a child's development when provided adequate secondary language education, therefore debunking the vast majority of myths that may inhibit such education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Crane |first1=John |title=When Will Public Elementary Schools in the US Finally Start Teaching Foreign Languages? |url=https://medium.com/@jcrane1/when-will-public-elementary-schools-in-the-us-finally-start-teaching-foreign-languages-6cbc2716161b |website=Medium.com |accessdate=16 November 2018|date=2018-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==By country or region==

===Africa===
In the African region, Countries such as Mozambique have taken the lead in bilingual education. The Ministry of Education and Human Development has made primary education fully bilingual in 2017. Children will be taught 16 Mozambican dialects during their early years of schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201503190228.html|title=Mozambique: Fully Bilingual Primary Education as From 2017|date=2015-03-19|work=Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique (Maputo)|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many African states introduce mother languages as subjects and education tools along commonly spoken international or foreign languages. Mother language instruction is terminated immediately during the schooling cycle and leaves only the international language established. It becomes a disadvantage that contributes to substantial lack of motivation on the part of teachers, students, and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/mother-language-education-africa|title=Mother language education in Africa|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{expand section|date=May 2016|1=e.g., [https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-30424-3_122], [http://www.edqual.org/publications/published-research/clegg07.pdf.1], [http://www.praesa.org.za/files/2012/07/Paper6.pdf], [https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/sites/teacheng/files/C413%20Juba%20Publication_FINAL_WEB%20ONLY%20v3.pdf], [https://books.google.com/books?id=FMoWyso1vuQC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=bilingual+education+africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik4vGxwrfMAhWjIqYKHYA0B58Q6AEIIzAA], [https://books.google.com/books?id=D6iIlllyNCEC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=bilingual+education+africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik4vGxwrfMAhWjIqYKHYA0B58Q6AEIRTAG], etc.}}

====Senegal====
Although bilingual schools exist, the majority of Senegalese schools teach in French and follow the French system. However, studies have shown that approximately 80% of teachers use a 'local language' in order to communicate with all of their students.&lt;ref name="World Data on Education, Senegal"&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. International Bureau of Education. [http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Senegal.pdf "World Data on Education, Senegal"]. UNESCO-IBE, 2010. Web. (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
[[Asia]] is the [[Earth|Earth's]] largest and most populous [[continent]], located primarily in the [[Eastern Hemisphere|eastern]] and [[northern hemisphere]]s. It includes a large number of countries, some of which are grouped into subregions.

====China====
In the [[Autonomous regions of China]] many children of the country's major ethnic minorities attend public schools where the medium of instructions is the local language, such as e.g. [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] or [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]. Traditionally, the textbooks there were little different from merely a translated version of the books used in the Chinese schools throughout the country; however, as of 2001, a move was on foot to create more teaching materials with locally based content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

|publisher= Springer|year= 2004
|isbn= 978-1-4020-8038-8|pages =119–120}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] as second language are also offered in these minority schools, and the central government makes increasing efforts to make them more effective. A law passed in February 2001 provided for the Mandarin-as-second-language classes in the ethnic-minority schools to start in the early years of elementary school whenever local conditions permit, rather than in the senior years of elementary school, as it was practiced before.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou (2004), pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it has been reported that Chinese has been used as the medium of instructions in some [[Autonomous county|autonomous counties]] even though less than 50% of the population "spoke and understood some Chinese"; this mismatch was thought to have contributed to the low grades earned by the students on the math and Chinese exams.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou (2004), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Hong Kong =====
In [[Hong Kong]] where both [[English language|English]] and [[Cantonese]] are official, both languages are taught in school and are mandatory subjects. Either English or Cantonese is used as the medium of instruction for other subjects. Increasingly, there are a large number of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]]-speaking schools in operation throughout Hong Kong as well since 1996. Study of Mandarin is mandatory in junior years (from Grade 1 to Grade 9). Hong Kong also has a bilingual education program using both Cantonese and Hong Kong Sign Language.

=====Macao=====
Chinese and Portuguese are the official languages of [[Macau]], but English plays an unofficial and highly prominent role. English is the language of instruction at the University of Macau and at some secondary schools. Other schools use Cantonese as the language of instruction. {{as of|2013}} there was one Portuguese-medium school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languageonthemove.com/multilingual-macau/|title=Multilingual Macau|date=April 22, 2013|publisher=languageonthemove.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
{{More citations needed|date=March 2007}}
In Japan, the need for bilingualism (mostly Japanese and English) has been pointed out, and there are some scholars who advocate teaching children subjects such as mathematics using English rather than Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://japansociology.com/2013/06/08/bilingual-education-in-japan/|title=Bilingual Education in Japan|date=2013-06-08|work=JAPANsociology|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this proposal, subjects such as history, however, would be taught solely in Japanese.

On the island of [[Hokkaido]], the indigenous and endangered [[Ainu language]] is receiving newfound interest with establishment of a small number of bilingual Ainu-Japanese elementary schools.

The largest non-Japanese, non-native to Japan minority are the [[Koreans in Japan|Koreans]]. Bilingual education in [[Korean language]] is provided by Korean international schools, more of which are affiliated with [[Chongryon]].

====Middle East====

=====The Arab World=====
Schools in the [[Middle East]] follow dual or triple language programmes.  The triple language programme is most commonly found in [[Lebanon]], [[Tunisia]], [[Syria]], and often implemented as well in [[Egypt]].  History, grammar, literature and the [[Arabic language]] are taught in the native language (Arabic), whereas Mathematics and sciences are generally taught in English and/or French.  In Lebanon, however, science and mathematics are taught in either French or English, depending on the school's administration or the grade level.  It is not uncommon to find French- or English- only schools, though usually these institutions are primarily international establishments.

In most [[Gulf countries]] as well as [[Jordan]], English is introduced as a second language early on alongside the primary medium of instruction, Arabic.  In [[Iraq]] however, triple language programmes are, like in Lebanon and Syria, normal, except rather than using French, [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is taught alongside Arabic and English due to Iraq's considerably sized Kurdish minority in the north, and bilingual official language policy regarding Kurdish.

In [[Morocco]], [[Berber languages|Berber]] can be used as a regional medium of elementary education, with widespread use of French and Arabic in higher grades. Due to Morocco's history of French colonialism, sole French-medium education is very widespread.

=====Israel=====
Normally, Israelis are taught in either Hebrew or Arabic depending on religion and ethnicity. Within the standard education system, thorough study of English is compulsory, and depending on the primary medium of education, Arabic or Hebrew are introduced as third languages with significantly lesser emphasis placed on achieving solid proficiency.  Within Hebrew-medium programmes, other foreign languages such as French, German, Russian, or Yiddish can often be studied as well.

Israel is also home to several international schools whereby the sole medium of education is either [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]]. In general, as English is taught early on across all Israeli schools, most Israelis become comfortably bilingual, much like what one would see in The Netherlands or Scandinavian countries. This in combination with a large proportion of English-language programming on television that is merely subtitled and seldom dubbed.

Recent peace initiatives have also led to a small number of bilingual and multi-religious schools in which both Hebrew and Arabic are used in equal emphasis.  The [[Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish Arab Education in Israel]] runs four bilingual schools, and the [[Neve Shalom]] peace village also hosts a local school.

====Mongolia====
There has been long standing encouragement to teach at least one other language other than Mongolian. Traditionally [[Russian language]] was taught during middle school and high school. After the 1990 transition to democracy, English language has been gaining more ground in Mongolian schools. Today many public schools at all levels teach one other language that are usually English, Russian, Korean, Japanese or Chinese. Although the core curriculum is in Mongolian, it is generally encouraged by the government and the public that the students should have some command of a secondary language when they graduate from high school. Also there are other private schools that teach their curricula in English.

====South Asia====
[[South Asia]] is the [[south]]ern [[region]] of the [[Asia]]n [[continent]], comprising the [[Himalayas|sub-Himalayan]] [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) countries and, [[#Definition by South Asian Studies programs|for some authorities]], adjoining countries to the west and east.

=====Bangladesh=====
In Bangladesh, Bengali is the first language. However, it has a colonial past and English is widely used in administrations, schools, courts etc. Bangladeshi children start English as Second Language quite early in their age (mostly from age 5-6). In National Curriculum, English is given an importance and it is taught compulsorily until twelfth grade. There are Government approved curriculum as well as other international systems of Educations which maintains English as a 'medium of instruction'.

=====India=====
{{Main|Bilingualism in India}}
The official languages of the Union of [[India]] are [[Hindi]] and English, with 21 other regional languages holding co-official status, including: [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Dogri]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kannada]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Malayalam]], [[Meitei language|Manipuri]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Santali language|Santali]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Urdu]].

Education in India follows the [[Three-language formula]], where children are to be taught English (or the medium of instruction in the school, grades 1-12), The Second Language (grades 1-10) is the Official language of the state (In most non-Hindi states) or Hindi (in the others), in a few states some schools offer a choice between the State Language and Hindi, and the third language (grades 5-8, often Hindi (in the non-Hindi states), the regional language of the state (if the student opted for Hindi as the second language,  a foreign language or Sanskrit). An exception is [[Tamil Nadu]] where only [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and English are taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

English-medium schools often find favour with parents, especially in urban areas, due to English's international prestige, India's Colonial heritage, its usage in Indian business and it being the medium of instruction in most Indian universities.

=====Philippines=====
In July 2009 [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] moved towards [[Education in the Philippines#Breakdown of the Program|mother-tongue based learning]] initially by issuing an order which allowed two alternative three-year bridging plans. Depending on the bridging plan adopted, the Filipino and English languages are to be phased in as the language of instruction beginning in the third and fourth grades.&lt;ref&gt;.

In 2007, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] signed a directive in Spain that would reintroduce teaching and learning the Spanish language in the Philippine school system starting in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getrealphilippines.com/blog/2012/07/re-introduction-of-spanish-mandated-by-arroyo-in-2007-trumpeted-by-bs-aquino-today/|title=Re-introduction of Spanish mandated by Arroyo in 2007, trumpeted by BS Aquino today|date=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order, Memorandum Order No. 276, s. 2007, issued on November 29, 2007, ordered the Department of Education to encourage the teaching and learning of the Spanish language throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/2007/11/29/memorandum-order-no-276-s-2007/|title= Memorandum Order No. 276, s. 2007|date=November 29, 2007|work=Official Gazette|publisher=Government of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Singapore=====
In Singapore, education is bilingual. The medium of instruction is in English and the learning of the mother tongue is compulsory. The mother tongue subject is usually [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Malay language|Malay]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the other official languages of Singapore. They are taught till pre-university level. Previously, students either attended an English-medium or a "vernacular school", which taught in one of the mother tongues. In 1960, government legislation standardised the primary medium of instruction to English, with the different vernacular languages ("mother tongue") allocated as the second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Development of Education in Singapore since 1965|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1121703274255/1439264-1153425508901/Development_Edu_Singapore_draft.pdf |accessdate=29 November 2012 |work= Associate Professor Goh Chor Boon and Professor S. Gopinathan|publisher=National Institute of Education | date=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students may also choose to learn a third language (German, French, Japanese, etc.) in secondary school and junior college or, if their respective school does not offer the language, at a [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|MOE]] Language Centre. This option is limited however, to the top 10% of any PSLE cohort; prospective third language students must have also scored A grades for English and their second language. Singaporean students returning from abroad who did not learn a second language may be exempted from their mother tongue and learn another second language in place of the mother tongue; however, such exemptions are rare and only granted on a case-to-case basis.

=====Thailand and Malaysia=====
Since the mid-1990s bilingual approaches to schooling and higher education have become popular in parts of [[South-east Asia]], especially in [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]] where different models have been applied, from L2 immersion (content taught in a non-native language) to parallel immersion, where core subjects are taught in both the mother-tongue and a second language (usually English).

English has been taught in schools in Malaysia as it is a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country (former British colony). During the 1980s to 1990s, when schools were nationalised under the government of Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]], English became a second language instead of the primary language of instruction. The Malaysian government reversed its decision to have Maths and Science taught in English, but is implementing different programmes designed to improve English language teaching within schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysia drops English language teaching|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/10/malaysia-tefl|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision has raised numerous debates, with various groups arguing for and against the use of English in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The sad state of English in Malaysia|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/malaysia/sad-state-english-malaysia|publisher=[[AsiaOne]]|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the existence of vernacular schools and prominent usage of dialects, some Chinese and Indian children become trilingual, speaking Malay, English and their mother tongue or dialect. However, English is still widely spoken as a [[de facto]] language of trade and academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Language Development in Singapore and Malaysia|chapter=The Malaysian Sociolinguistic Situation:An Overview|page=7|first1=Irene F.H.|last1=Wong|first2=Henry|last2=Thambyrajah|editor-first=Anna|editor-last=Kwan-Terry|date=1991|publisher=[[NUS Press|Singapore University Press]]|isbn=9789971691493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulties and disputes characteristic of the US experience have not been replicated in these Asian countries, though they are not without controversy.  Generally, it can be said that there is widespread acknowledgment of the need to improve English competence in the population, and bilingual approaches, where language is taught through subject content, are seen to be the most effective means of attaining this.  The most significant limiting factors are the shortage of teachers linguistically competent to teach in a second language and the costs involved in use of expatriate native speakers for this purpose.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], some schools teach bilingual programs which cater to children speaking languages other than English. Baldauf&lt;ref&gt;(2005)&lt;/ref&gt; explains that these programs are now beginning to benefit from more government support. Bilingual education for Indigenous students, however, has only received intermittent official backing. In the Northern Territory, for example, bilingual programs for Indigenous students begun with Federal Government support in the early 1970s, but by December 1998 the Northern Territory Government had announced its decision to shift $3 million away from the 29 bilingual programs to a Territory-wide program teaching English as a second language. Within 12 months though the government had softened its position. Most bilingual programs were allowed to continue under the guise of two-way education. Then on 24 August 2005, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training announced that the government would be "revitalizing bi-lingual education" at 15 Community Education Centres: [[Alekerange, Northern Territory|Alekerange]], [[Angurugu, Northern Territory|Angurugu]], [[Borroloola, Northern Territory|Borroloola]], [[Gapuwiyak, Northern Territory|Gapuwiyak]], [[Gunbalanya, Northern Territory|Gunbalanya]], [[Kalkaringi, Northern Territory|Kalkaringi]], [[Lajamanu, Northern Territory|Lajamanu]], [[Maningrida, Northern Territory|Maningrida]], [[Milingimbi Island|Milingimbi]], [[Ramingining, Northern Territory|Ramingining]], [[Ngkurr, Northern Territory|Ngkurr]], Shepherdson College, [[Numbulwar, Northern Territory|Numbulwar]], [[Yirrkala, Northern Territory|Yirrkala]] and [[Yuendumu, Northern Territory|Yuendumu]]. This revitalisation is conceived as part of an effort aimed at "providing effective education from pre-school through to senior secondary at each of the Territory's 15 Community Education Centres". As Harris &amp; Devlin (1986) observe, "Aboriginal bilingual education in Australia represents much more than a range of education programs. It has been a measure of non-Aboriginal commitment to either assimilation or cultural pluralism". In 2008 it again shifted with the government attempting to force the nine remaining bilingual schools to teach the first four hours of classes in English.

===Europe===
The ''[[European Schools]]'' group is a network of thirteen private schools in EU countries that provide multilingual and multicultural education at nursery, primary and secondary levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Locations of the European Schools |url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/European-Schools/locations |website=Office of the Secretary-General of the European Schools |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Organisation of studies |url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/European-Schools/studies/studies-organisation |website=Office of the Secretary-General of the European Schools |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
[[Belgium]] has three official languages: [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]. The constitution guarantees free education, so private schools can use any language, but state(-recognised) schools teach in the language of the language area where it is located. For [[Brussels]], which is an officially bilingual French-Dutch area, schools use either Dutch or French as medium.

Even though Belgium has two major languages (Dutch in Flanders, and French in Wallonia), bilingual instruction does rarely occur since Belgian law only permits education in one official language. In Flanders, bilingual instruction is only allowed as a short-term project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agirdag|first=Orhan|title=Exploring bilingualism in a monolingual school system: insights from Turkish and native students from Belgian schools|journal=British Journal of Sociology of Education|date=1 May 2010|volume=31|issue=3|pages=307–321|doi=10.1080/01425691003700540|url=https://ugent.academia.edu/OrhanAgirdag/Papers/202294/Exploring_Bilingualism_In_a_Monolingual_School_System_Insights_From_Turkish_and_Native_Students_From_Belgian_Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
{{See also|Language policy in France}}
[[France]] has one official language, [[French language|French]]. However, regional provincial languages including [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Gallo language|Gallo]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] have charter protection, and bilingual education programmes and regional language course electives have been established. However, due to the strict French-language policy imposed by national government, there is no centrally allocated funding for any of these programmes. All funding is at the municipal level, with many of the regional languages face extreme endangerment. France is known for wanting to maintain its lingual and cultural roots, and speaking a language other than French or mixing French with other languages is looked down on. This is apparent the French educational system, where French is highly prioritized over other languages and emphasis is put not only on the maintenance of the French language, but also on pushing students not to integrate French with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costa|first=James|date=6 Mar 2010|title=France and Language (s): Old Policies and New Challenges in Education. Towards a Renewed Framework?|url=|journal=Archive Ouverte en Sciences de l'Homme et de la Société|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
In the [[Netherlands]], there are around 100 bilingual schools. In these schools, the first language is Dutch, whereas the second language is usually English and occasionally German. In the province of [[Friesland]], where [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] is an official language, some primary schools are trilingual, teaching in Dutch, West Frisian, and English. Most bilingual secondary schools are TVWO (Bilingual Preparatory Scientific Education), but THAVO (Bilingual Higher General Secondary Education) and TVMBO-TL (Bilingual Preparatory Vocational Education - Theoretical Learning Pathway)&lt;ref&gt;TVMBO-TL was recently introduced at O.R.S. Lek en Linge, Culemborg https://www.lekenlinge.nl/downloaddocument?pid=163&amp;doc=KDEyKS10d2VldGFsaWctdm1iby10LnBkZg==&lt;/ref&gt; have been introduced, too.

====Republic of Ireland====
The Republic of Ireland has two official languages, [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]]. With the [[Irish language]] facing endangerment, as well as the presence of regions where Irish is still spoken as native (referred to as the [[Gaeltacht]]), the [[Irish constitution]] protects and reserves the right for education to be established through the medium of either official language, and it thus is.

An Irish-medium school is referred to as [[Gaelscoil]] (plural, Gaelscoileanna) This movement has been met with some success in that 10% of the schooling in Ireland is conducted in Irish. The movement has also been successful in setting up schools in both urban and rural areas, ranging from Dublin and Cork, to the traditional Gaeltacht regions.

====Spain====

=====Andalusia=====
In [[Andalusia]] (Spain's second southernmost region), things have changed drastically concerning bilingual education since the introduction of the Plurilingualism Promotion Plan by the autonomous government. The plan was born as the realization for the Andalusian territory of the European language policies regarding the teaching and learning of languages. With special strength in the past ten years bilingual education has worked at most elementary schools.

In addition to this new European scene, the Scheme for the Promotion of Plurilingualism has learned a lot from the first experimental bilingual sections set up in some schools by the Andalusian government in 1998. Following the content-based approach, French and German were used to partly teach other subjects. This successful experience, as show the international tests that the students have been given, is the starting point for a more ambitious scene, where 400 schools will be involved in the next four years, more languages, especially English, will take part, and a lot of investigation and implementation of the Integrated Curriculum of languages must be carried out.

Being aware of the necessity of the Andalusian people to adapt to the new scenario, a major government plan, called "strategies for the second modernization of Andalusia", was designed in 2003. The document also underlined language diversity as a source of richness and a valuable heritage of humankind which needs to be looked after.

It was then clear that a scheme was needed to carry out this new language policy in the territory, especially affecting education, with clear goals, timing and funding.

The scheme is to be developed through five major programmes and also an organization and assessment plan.

The programmes are:
*Bilingual schools
*Official Schools of Languages
*Plurilingualism and teachers
*Plurilingualism and society
*Organization and assessment plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/plurilinguismo/planing.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205105956/http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/plurilinguismo/planing.pdf|archive-date=2009-02-05|title=Plurilingualism Promotion Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Basque Country, Navarre, Galicia, Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands=====
In addition to [[Castilian Spanish]] being the primary [[official language]] of [[Spain]], the kingdom also has several co-official regional languages which enjoy equal and unbiased constitutional protection and promotion: [[Catalan language|Catalan/Valencian]] (in [[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]), [[Galician language|Galician]] (in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), [[Basque language|Basque]] (in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and the northern zone of [[Navarre]]) and [[Aranese]] (in [[Val d'Aran]], [[Catalonia]]).

Many schools are bilingual in the regional language as well as Castilian at both the elementary and secondary levels. Regional universities also often provide programmes through the regional medium. Education in all co-official languages uses to receive both national and regional funding.

Unlike [[France]] in which regional languages face incredible endangerment and possible extinction, Spain's long-established approach to making regional bilingual education mandatory has served often as a model for both the survival and thriving state of the languages indigenous to the country.

====Sweden====
[[Sweden]] has one official language and five recognized minority languages,&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. ''Language Policy, 3''(2), 181-201.&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is to great extent the only one of these in which education is offered. During the 21st century more and more schools started to offer national programs in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agirdag|first=Orhan|title=The International School Consultancy Group|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom and dependencies====
The British Isles have several indigenous languages apart from [[English language|English]]. These include [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (official in Wales), [[Irish Language|Irish]], [[Manx Gaelic]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], and the [[Scots language]] (which is sometimes considered as a dialect of English).

[[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], and the [[Isle of Man]] have each established bilingual programmes which provide education through the medium of their indigenous language. Most often, except for the cases of Manx and Cornish, these programmes exist where the language is spoken communally as a first language.

=====Wales=====
Roughly a quarter of schoolchildren in Wales now receive their education through the [[Welsh medium education|medium of Welsh]], and children wishing to join a Welsh medium school ({{Lang-cy|ysgol Gymraeg}}) do not have to speak Welsh to go to one if they are young enough to learn the language quickly. Welsh medium education has met with great success across Wales since the first such schools opened in the 1940s. There are current plans to extend further provision in urban centres such as [[Cardiff]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Swansea]] and [[Llanelli]] to cater for growing demand; this has caused controversy in some areas.

Welsh-speaking areas use Welsh-medium education almost exclusively. Parents have a legal right for their children to receive education in Welsh, and each local authority caters for this. In the Western flank of Wales, [[Carmarthenshire]], [[Ceredigion]], [[Gwynedd]] and [[Anglesey]], most primary and secondary schools are Welsh medium or have bilingual streams. Some 75-80% of all pupils in [[Carmarthenshire]] and [[Ceredigion]] receive their education through the medium of Welsh, with this figure increasing in Gwynedd to around 90%.

In English-medium schools, the study of Welsh is compulsory and must be taught from age 5 to age 16 in all state-funded schools.

=====Northern Ireland=====
Irish Gaelic received official recognition in Northern Ireland for the first time in 1998 under the [[Good Friday Agreement]]. A cross-border body known as [[Foras na Gaeilge]] was established to promote the language in both Northern Ireland and the Republic.
The British government in 2001 ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Irish Gaelic (in respect only of Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, thus giving it a degree of protection and status somewhat comparable to the Welsh language in Wales and Scottish Gaelic in Scotland. This included a range of specific undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters (whilst the Ulster variant of [[Scots language|Scots]], known as [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]], was specified under Part II of the Charter.)

The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 states: "It shall be the duty of the Department (of Education) to encourage and facilitate the development of Irish-medium education."

There are no Ulster Scots-medium schools, even at primary level.

===Americas===

====North America====

=====Canada=====
{{Main|Official bilingualism in Canada}}

======English and French======
In [[Canada]], education is under provincial jurisdiction. However, the federal government has been a strong supporter of establishing Canada as a bilingual country and has helped pioneer the [[French immersion]] programs in the public education systems throughout Canada. In French-immersion, students with no previous French language training, usually beginning in Kindergarten or grade 1, do all of their school work in French. Depending on provincial jurisdiction, some provinces also offer an extended French program that begins in grade 5 which offers relatively more courses in French. In this case the student takes French immersion until grade nine but may continue throughout their high school education. Similar English-immersion programmes also exist for Francophone children.

Education is generally monolingual in either English or French according to the majority population within which a school is located.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The second official language is introduced with allocated time provided each week for instruction in the language as a subject.

======Quebec======
Quebec is Canada's only legally monolingual French-speaking province. Based on section 59 of Canada's Constitution Act of 1982, provides that not all of the language rights listed under Canada's official bilingualism policy in previous section 23 will apply in Quebec. Specifically:

(1) In Quebec, a child may be educated in English only if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in English.

(2)In New Brunswick, Canada's only officially bilingual province, students have the right to education in the official language which they understand; students able to understand both languages have the right to education in either system.

(3) In the rest of Canada, a child may be educated in French if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in French, or if at least one parent has French as his or her mother tongue (defined in section 23 as "first language learned and still understood").

One practical consequence of this asymmetry is that all migrants who arrive in Quebec from foreign countries are required to place their children in French-language schools. This includes immigrants whose mother tongue is English and immigrants who received their schooling in English.

On the other hand, Section 23 provides a nearly universal right to English-language schooling for the children of Canadian-born anglophones living in Quebec.
Section 23 also provides, in theory, a nearly universal right to French-language schooling for the children of all francophones living outside Quebec, including immigrants from French-speaking countries who settle outside Quebec, and who are Canadian citizens.

Another element of asymmetry between Quebec and most anglophone provinces is that while Quebec provides public English-language primary and secondary education throughout the province, most other provinces provide French-language education only "where numbers warrant."

======First Nations reserves and Inuit settlements======
Canada also has bilingual programmes for [[First Nations]]' languages on numerous [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian aboriginal]] reserves in combination with either English, French, or both. Some programmes are gradually being established, whilst others are already long established. Most notable bilingual programmes that exist include [[Inuktitut]], [[Inuinnaqtun]], [[Cree]], [[Blackfoot]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]], and Pacific Coast [[Salish languages]].

Many of these programmes were set up in the late 1980s and early 1990s by academic [[linguists]] wishing to preserve the languages, respectively - especially in areas where there either is a healthy speaking base, or an endangerment of as low as two remaining speakers of a language. Prior to this, as late as the 1970s and early 1980s, First Nations and [[Inuit]] in Canada, as Native Americans in the United States, were forced into [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]] imposed on them by the Canadian government to integrate indigenous cultures into European-Canadian society. This came with the dramatic loss of the languages, religious beliefs, and cultures themselves due to widespread use of corporal punishment and mental abuse. As of 2010, new programmes are mushrooming across Canada to try to save what is left, but are often met with mixed success and funding challenges at federal, provincial, and reserve levels.

======Other minority languages======
In the province of [[British Columbia]], the city of [[Vancouver]] since 2002 has established a new bilingual Mandarin Chinese-English immersion programme at the elementary school level in order to accommodate Vancouver's both historic and present strong ties to the Chinese-speaking world, already in itself having a very sizeable Chinese population local to the city. Six Vancouver schools have thus far adopted the programme, and a secondary school track to continue thereupon is being designed. Other suburbs within what is referred to as the [[Greater Vancouver Regional District]] are also considering adopting the programme into a small number of schools. Similar programmes are being developed for both [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] to serve in representing the large South Asian cultural community and its interests in the [[City of Surrey]]. By default, most schools in British Columbia teach through English, with French immersion options available. In both English and French-medium schools, one can study and take government exams in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]] at the secondary level.

In [[Alberta]], the city of [[Edmonton]] has had a well established Chinese (Mandarin) bilingual education program ([[Edmonton Chinese Bilingual Education Association]]) since 1982. The program is currently offered in 13 schools throughout the city consisting of 6 elementary schools, 4 junior high schools and 3 high schools. Students enrolled in any of the elementary schools spend half a day learning in Chinese and the other half in English.

In [[Manitoba]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] communities have played an extensive role in the development and history of the province. Bilingual Ukrainian-English education programmes have therefore long been established, alongside smaller programmes introducing and implementing [[French language|French]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] in the town of [[Gimli, Manitoba|Gimli]], and [[First Nations]]' languages.

Private Islamic and Jewish schools across Canada also have bilingual and trilingual programmes that include [[Arabic]] or [[Hebrew]], respectively.

In [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] and other parts of [[Nova Scotia]], a number of secondary schools now offer the option of taking introductory courses in [[Scottish Gaelic]], as reflecting upon the province's both intimate and dark history with the Gaelic language and Highland Scottish diaspora.

=====United States=====
[[File:SER-Niños Charter School.jpg|thumb|[[SER-Niños Charter School]], a bilingual [[charter school|state charter school]] in the [[Gulfton, Houston|Gulfton]] area of [[Houston]], [[Texas]]]]
Bilingual education in the U.S. focuses on English Language Learners (ELL).

The emphasis on English rejects that the student has a dominant language as part of their identity and culture that will continue to develop with time. According to the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] website, a bilingual education program is "an educational program for [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] students". (The Office of English Language Acquisition, 2009).{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The term "limited English proficiency" remains in use by the federal government, but has fallen out of favor elsewhere. According to [http://www.bankstreet.edu/literacyguide/ell.html Bankstreet's Literacy Guide] this shift is due to the fact that the term ELL represents a more accurate reflection of language acquisition. The term "English language learner" is now preferred in schools and educational research to refer to a student whose first language is not English and who needs language support services in order to succeed in school.

In the United States, proponents of the practice argue that it will not only help to keep non-English-speaking children from falling behind their peers in math, science, and social studies while they master English, but such programs teach English better than English-only programs. For many students, the process of learning literacy and a new language simultaneously is simply an overwhelming task, so bilingual programs began as a way to help such students develop native language literacy first - research by Cummins,&lt;ref&gt;(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; a central researcher in the field, shows that skills such as literacy developed in a first language will transfer to English. Opponents of bilingual education argue that it delays students' mastery of English, thereby retarding the learning of other subjects as well. In [[California]], where at least one-third of students were enrolled in bilingual classes in the mid-1990s,&lt;ref name="'70s 270"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|pages= 270–271|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been considerable politicking for and against bilingual education.

The very first instance of bilingual education in the United States occurred with Polish immigrants in the first permanent English settlement of [[Virginia]] in what is now the United States. The Poles provided the community with manufactured pitch necessary to prevent the sinking of ships, and glass works among other industries. When the [[House of Burgesses]] met in 1619, the rights extended only to Englishmen. The Poles, in turn, launched the first recorded strike in the New World.&lt;ref name="In Quest of a Cultural Identity"&gt;{{cite book |title= In Quest of a Cultural Identity: An Inquiry for the Polish Community|last= Seidner|first= Stanley S.|year= 1976|publisher= IUME, Teachers College, [[Columbia University]]|location= New York, New York|id= ERIC ED167674|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED167674&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED167674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In dire need of their skills and industries, the Poles received the "[[rights of Englishmen]]," and established the first bilingual schools with subjects taught in English and Polish.&lt;ref name="In Quest of a Cultural Identity"/&gt;  From this first documented historic beginning, bilingual education existed in some form or another in the United States. During the 18th century, Franciscan missionaries from California to Texas used indigenous languages for translating and teaching the Catholic catechism to Native Americans. By the mid-19th century, private and public bilingual schools had include such native languages as Czech, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish.&lt;ref name="The American bilingual Tradition"&gt;{{cite book |title= The American bilingual Tradition|last= Kloss|first= Heinz|origyear= 1977|year= 1998|publisher= Newbury House|location= Rowley, MA|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohio became the first state in 1839, to adopt a bilingual education law, authorizing German-English instruction at parents' request. Louisiana enacted an identical provision for French and English in 1847, and the New Mexico Territory did so for Spanish and English in 1850.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"&gt;{{cite book |title= Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice|last= Crawford|first= James|year= 1999|publisher= BES|location= Los Angeles, CA|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, about a dozen states had passed similar laws. Elsewhere, many localities provided bilingual instruction without state sanction, in languages as diverse as Norwegian, Italian, Polish, Czech, and Cherokee.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"/&gt; Beginning in 1959, public schools in Miami introduced bilingual programs. In 1968 the U.S., with Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or, informally, the [[Bilingual Education Act]], Congress first mandated bilingual education in order to give immigrants access to education in their "first" language. The Act was amended in 1988.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"/&gt;  Federal spending on bilingual education jumped from $7.5 million in 1968 to $150 million by 1979.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

A 1974 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling, ''[[Lau v. Nichols]]'', gave further momentum to bilingual education.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;  Here, the Court held that [[San Francisco]] schools violated minority language students' rights when they educated students in the same classes as other students&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; without special provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/17_02/Bili172.shtml Bilingual Education Is A Human and Civil Right - Volume 17 No. 2 - Winter 2002/2003 - Rethinking Schools Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together, the [[Bilingual Education Act]] and the ''Lau v. Nichols'' ruling mandated that schools needed to at least provide some type of services to support English language learners, though neither specified what type of educational program needed to be provided.  As such, both bilingual and English-only programs flourished after the law's passage and the court ruling.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

The [[Bilingual Education Act]] was terminated in 2001 by new federal education policy, with the passage of [[No Child Left Behind]] by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]]. This law offers no support for native language learning, but rather emphasized accountability in English only, and mandates that all students, including ELLs, are tested yearly in English.

The majority of U.S. high school students in the United States are required to take at least one to two years of a second language.  The vast majority of these classes are either French or Spanish.  In a large number of schools this is taught in a manner known as [[Language immersion|FLES]], in which students learn about the second language in a manner similar to other subjects such as mathematics or science.  Some schools use an additional method known as [[FLEX (Language Teaching)|FLEX]] in which the "nature of the language" and culture are also taught. High school education almost never uses "immersion" techniques.

======Controversy in the United States======
In recent times there has been a lot of discussion about bilingual education. In the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision, [[Horne v. Flores]], the majority opinion stated, "Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI ([[Structured English Immersion]]) is significantly more effective than bilingual education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Proponents of bilingual education claim that it is not only easier for students to learn English if they are literate in their first language, but that such students will learn English better and become bilingual and biliterate.&lt;ref&gt;(see Krashen, 2002; August &amp; Hakuta, 1997; Crawford, 2000; Cummins, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; One study shows that English language learners introduced to a transitional bilingual program gained a fair amount of English comprehension and reading skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tong |first=F. |author2=Lara-Alecio, R. |author3=Irby, B. |author4=Mathes, P. |author5=Kwok, O. |date=2008 |title=Accelerating Early Academic Oral English Development in Transitional Bilingual and Structured English Immersion Programs |journal=American Educational Research Journal |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=1011–1044 |doi=10.3102/0002831208320790 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents further claim that effective bilingual programs strive to achieve proficiency in both English and the students' home language. Dual language or Two-Way bilingual programs are one such approach, whereby half of the students speak English and half are considered English language learners (ELLs). The teacher instructs in English and in the ELLs' home language. The dual purpose of this type of classroom is to teach the children a new language and culture, and language diversity in such classrooms is seen as a resource. Programs in English only eradicate the native languages immigrants bring to this country, while dual language bilingual programs serve to maintain such languages in an "additive" context, where a new language is added without the first being lost. One paper states that two-way developmental bilingual education programs in elementary school have the most success in language minority students' long term academic achievement. These students will maintain their gains in academic performance in secondary level academic classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collier |first=Virginia P. |date=Fall 1995 |title=Acquiring a Second Language for School |journal=Directions in Language &amp; Education - National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education |volume=1 |issue=4 |quote=To assure cognitive and academic success in a second language, a student's first language system, oral and written, must be developed to a high cognitive level at least through the elementary-school years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study shows the positive results of a two-way bilingual education program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=National Center for Research on Cultural Diversity and Second Language Learning |date=March 1999 |title=Two-Way Bilingual Education Programs in Practice: A National and Local Perspective |journal=Center for Applied Linguistics |url=http://www.cal.org/resources/Digest/ed379915.html |accessdate=2008-03-14 |quote=Two-way programs provide both sets of students with ample exposure to the two languages, allowing them to progress academically in both languages and gain an appreciation of another culture. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314215044/http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/ed379915.html |archivedate=14 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggests that the transitional bilingual education method can improve development of the native language without hindering the development of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duran |first=L.K. |author2=Roseth, C.J. |author3=Hoffman, P. |date=2010 |title=An experimental study comparing English-only and Transitional Bilingual Education on Spanish-speaking preschoolers' early literacy development |journal=Early Chilhood Research Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=207–217 |doi=10.1016/j.ecresq.2009.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some mistakenly believe that once a student can converse in English (Basic interpersonal communication skills - BICS), they will naturally perform well academically (cognitive academic language proficiency - CALP) in English. It has been postulated that BICS and CALP are two different sets of skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   |last =Carrasquillo  | first =Angela L  |author2=Rodriguez, Vivian  | title =Language Minority Students in the Mainstream Classroom | publisher =Multilingual Matters Ltd. | year =1996  | location =Bristol, PA  | page =202 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED392281&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED392281  | isbn =978-1-85359-297-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of bilingual education claim that students with other primary languages besides Spanish are placed in Spanish classes rather than taught in their native languages&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; and that many bilingual education programs fail to teach students English.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; Critics of bilingual education have claimed that studies supporting bilingual education tend to have poor methodologies and that there is little empirical support in favor of it.

The controversy over bilingual education is often enmeshed in a larger political and cultural context. Opponents of bilingual education are sometimes accused of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]]. This is especially so in the case of such groups as [[English First (lobbying organization)|English First]], which is a conservative organization that promotes the stance that English should be the official language of the United States. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] and other cities, Minister of education of the [[Young Lords]], Tony Baez and others held marches and other activities to promote bilingual education. Proponents of bilingual education are frequently accused of practicing [[identity politics]], to the detriment of children and of immigrants.
:"To aid and monitor the education of English language learners (ELL)through mother-tongue and English education, the federal government enacted the Bilingual Education Act (Title V11) of the elementary and secondary Education Act in 1968. As an offshoot of president Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, the act strove to help disenfranchised language-miniority students, especially Hispanics. Unfortunately, the acts aims were somewhat ambiguous. As Crawford (2000a) writes 'enacted at the apex of the Great Society, bilingual education act of 1968 passed congress without a single dissent. Americans have spent the past 30 years debating what it was meant to accomplish'." (p.&amp;nbsp;107).&lt;ref&gt;Ovando, Carlos J. (2003). "Bilingual Education in the United States: Historical Development and Current Issues" [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=EJ666800 (Bilingual Research Journal, 27(1), 1-24.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

======California======
[[California]] is the state with the highest number of English Learners (ELs) in the United States. One out of three students in California is an EL.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; In June 1998, [[Proposition 227]] was passed by 61% of the California electorate. This proposition mandates that ELs be placed in structured English immersion for a period "not normally to exceed one year," then be transferred to mainstream classrooms taught "overwhelmingly in English."&lt;ref&gt;[http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm State of California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618094226/http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm |date=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposition also gave parents the possibility to request alternative programs for their children, however, the availability of waivers and information to parents have been a challenge in the implementation of this proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish et al., (2002). "Proposition 227 and Instruction of English Learners in California: Evaluation Update" [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED482963&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED482963 (U.S. Department of Education)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the California Department of Education contracted with the American Institutes for Research (AIR) and WestEd to conduct a five-year evaluation of the effects of Proposition 227.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.air.org/news/documents/227Report.pdf |title=American Institutes for Research (AIR) |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913185100/http://www.air.org/news/documents/227Report.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study methodology focused on "A combination of student achievement analysis, phone interviews, case study site visits, and written surveys was used to examine such questions as how the proposition was implemented, which EL services are most and least effective, and what [[unintended consequence]]s resulted from Proposition 227's implementation."

The authors caution about the limitations in the statewide data. California does not have the capacity to link student academic progress over time across years; however, using student-level linked data over time from the Los Angeles Unified School District, and complementing that analysis with surveys, site visits and interviews, the study found "no conclusive evidence favoring one instructional program over another." Students who remained in bilingual education have similar academic growth trajectories when compared with students who switched to English Immersion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wested.org/cs/we/view/rs/661 |title=WestEd: Effects of the Implementation of Proposition 227 on the Education of English Learners, K-12: 2002 Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711042851/http://www.wested.org/cs/we/view/rs/661 |archive-date=2007-07-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

California, among other states, also has many public schools which have Immersion programs, most commonly Spanish/English Immersion but also including other languages. Immersion programs include native speakers of both languages and include instruction in both languages, with primary (grade) schools typically having 90% instruction in the minority language in the early grades, transitioning to 50% instruction in each of the minority language and English in the upper grades.

Proposition 227 has been repealed in 2016 by [[California Proposition 58 (2016)]].

======Arizona======
California was followed by [[Arizona]] in the passage of similar legislation, [[English for Children (Arizona Proposition 203, 2000)|Arizona Proposition 203]], which ended several programs previously available to ESL students. Arizona was the first state to provide bilingual education in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

======Georgia======
During the 1990s the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] increased its foreign born population by 233%. That was the second largest increase in the country, and Georgia is the sixth fastest growing state in the United States. Georgia has the seventh largest illegal immigrant population in the country; in the 2000 census 228,000 illegal immigrants lived in the state. During the 1980s and 1990s a labor shortage in the carpet industry contributed to an increase in the Hispanic population of Whitfield County, Georgia. Today almost half of the students in the Dalton (the hub of Whitfield County) public schools are Hispanic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2416 New Georgia Encyclopedia: Whitfield County]&lt;/ref&gt;

Erwin Mitchell, a local Dalton lawyer, founded the [[Georgia Project]] in 1996 to help teach the influx of Hispanic students who have moved into the Dalton public schools. The Georgia Project partners with the [[University of Monterrey]] in Monterrey, [[Mexico]] to bring teachers from Mexico to Georgia Schools. Sixty teachers from the University of Monterrey have taught in Georgia since 1997, and they typically teach for two to three years on [[H-1B visa]]s. The Georgia Project also has a Summer Institute that trains American teachers to speak Spanish and learn about Mexican culture. The Georgia Project is a bilingual/bicultural program that is primarily funded from federal education appropriations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://communityresourcebank.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=874 National Immigration Forum: Community Resource Bank, Success Stories, The Georgia Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

======Native American Reservations======
Following similar [[First Nations]]' models to [[Canada]], academic [[linguists]] throughout the [[United States]] are working closely with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] reservations communities to establish immersion and second-language programs for a number of respective tribal languages including [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Hopi]], [[Cherokee]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Lakhota]], and [[Sioux]], among others. Due to the combination of often a violent and isolative relationship between European settlers and Native Americans, their languages and communities have suffered dramatically in terms of facing extreme endangerment or extinction. The success of these programmes is mixed, depending largely on how healthy the status of the language in question is.

However, English-medium education still remains most widely used. Native programs often suffer a lack of state support in terms of funding or encouragement due in large part to the strong preference towards a melting-pot society. [[Native American boarding schools]], which enforced white American values and the English language were extensively used as late as the 1990s, and were notorious for implementing corporal punishment if a Native child was caught speaking his or her language or freely practicing their tribal faith.

====South America====

=====Argentina=====
There are many English-Spanish schools in Argentina. Several of them are in the provinces where the Irish who were part of the local Elite used to live. While medium to big sized cities are likely to have several bilingual schools, bilingual education remains an exception rather than the norm and is generally reserved for the upper classes. There is not a nationally encompassing bilingual program available for public schools. Because of the ties that have historically bound private education to religious institutions, many of the bilingual schools in the country are Roman Catholic schools. For example, out of the three available bilingual schools in a medium-sized city such as Mar del Plata, two of them (Holy Mary of Northern Hills and Holy Trinity College) are practicing Roman Catholic schools. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

== Effects of mother-tongue instruction ==
Continuing to foster the abilities of children's mother tongue along with other languages has proven essential for their personal and educational development because they retain their cultural identity and gain a deeper understanding of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummins|first=Jim|date=2001|title=Bilingual children's mother tongue: Why is it important for education|url=|journal=Sprogforum|volume=19|pages=15–20|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two 2016 studies of mother-tongue instruction in Ethiopia and Kenya respectively show that it had positive outcomes for the students in both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seid|first=Yared|date=2016-12-01|title=Does learning in mother tongue matter?

}}'''Biocybernetics''' is the application of [[cybernetics]] to [[biological science]], composed of biological disciplines that benefit from the application of cybernetics including [[neurology]] and multicellular systems. Biocybernetics plays a major role in [[systems biology]], seeking to integrate different levels of information to understand how biological systems function.

Biocybernetics is an abstract science and is a fundamental part of [[theoretical biology]], based upon the principles of [[systemics]].

== Terminology ==
Biocybernetics is a conjoined word from bio (Greek: βίο / life) and [[cybernetics]] (Greek: κυβερνητική / controlling-governing). Although the extended form of the word is biological cybernetics, the field is most commonly referred to as biocybernetics in scientific papers. Bioinformatics may also be properly referred to as bio informatics.

== Early proponents ==
Early proponents of biocybernetics include Ross Ashby, Hans Drischel, and Norbert Wiener among others. Popular papers published by each scientist are listed below.

== Similar fields ==
Papers and research that delve into topics involving biocybernetics may be found under a multitude of similar names, including molecular cybernetics, neurocybernetics, and cellular cybernetics. Such fields involve disciplines that specify certain aspects of the study of the living organism (for example, neurocybernetics focuses on the study neurological models in organisms).

== Categories ==
* Biocybernetics – the study of an entire living organism
* [[Neurocybernetics]] – cybernetics dealing with neurological models. (''[[Psycho-Cybernetics]]'' was the title of a self-help book, and is not a scientific discipline)
* Molecular cybernetics – cybernetics dealing with molecular systems (e.g. molecular biology cybernetics)
* Cellular cybernetics – cybernetics dealing with cellular systems (e.g. information technology/cell phones or biological cells)
* Evolutionary cybernetics – study of the evolution of informational systems (See also [[evolutionary programming]], [[evolutionary algorithm]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5709">'''SCS''' is an acronym for "''Sistema Cablaggio Semplificato''" ("Simplified Cable Solution"). It uses a [[fieldbus]] network protocol and has applications in the field of [[home automation]] and [[building automation]]. It is used mainly in [[Bticino|bTicino]] and [[Legrand (company)|Legrand]] installations.

==General features==
An SCS bus is based on a sheathed [[twisted pair]] formed of two flexible conductors; these are braided and unshielded with isolation 300/500V, [[Extra-low voltage#Separated_or_safety_extra-low_voltage_.28SELV.29|SELV]] as double isolation is required – according to the rules adopted by CEI (International Electrotechnical Committee). The bus is unpolarized, devices are required to support the DC power supply in both polarity.

===Wiring===
Two kind of wiring are possible:
*''Free cabling'' were a mix of bus and star topology are present, better for old houses
*''Star wiring'' were all devices are connected to the switch rack, better for new houses

===Communication===
Across the SCS bus four different types of signals are transmitted in frequency modulation:
* Electricity supply via 27 Vdc
* Data with a frequency clock of 9600&amp;nbsp;Hz
* Sound
* Video
The transmission protocol is the [[CSMA/CA]].

===Functions===
Through the SCS bus you have the following functions:
* Light control
* Automation
* Sound diffusion
* Energy management
* Thermoregulation
* Video intercom
* Alarm system
All the listed functions share the same technology and the same procedures for configuration / installation.

===Configuration===
All devices connected to SCS bus must be manually configured, no autolearn is possible, apart Alarm system and extenders. Configuration assign an address and an operating mode. Two kind of configurations are possible:
*''Physical'' - using numbered jumpers with different values [[resistor]]
*''Virtual'' - using a configuration [[software]] connected with an [[ethernet]] [[Residential gateway|gateway]]. In this case the address and operating mode are written in a non volatile memory in every device. Applying a physical jumper override the virtual configuration wiping the memory.

====Addressing details====
Device addressing use three different 'digits' '''A|PL|GR'''. The A mean the room, the PL is the Point of Load in the room, and GR is the group. Group join loads in same or different rooms in a logical manner. Not all devices has group addressing. All devices must answer to room broadcast called AMB. All devices must answer to general broadcast called GEN. Physical and Virtual addressing has different limitations:
{| class="wikitable sortable"
 ! digits
 ! Physical
 ! Virtual
 ! note
|-
 ! A
 | 1-9
 | 0-10
 | 11 rooms max in a single SCS domain
|-
 ! PL
 | 1-9
 | 0-15
 | A=0,PL=0 is forbidden, so 175 loads are addressable in a single SCS domain
|-
 ! GR
 | 1-9
 | 0-255
 | group
 |}
In big houses and buildings, SCS address extension is possible, were different address domains are connected via some bridges. Only some kind of messages can cross a bridge.

==Certifications==
Devices connected to the SCS bus are [http://www.imq.it/ IMQ]-certified and comply with these product standards ([[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) EN 50428 - IEC EN 60669-1/A1 - IEC EN 60669-2-1 - IEC EN 50090-2-2 - IEC EN 50090-2-3 ).

==Integration==
You can interact with the SCS bus through a [[Gateway (computer program)|gateway]] and an open high-level [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] called [[OpenWebNet]]. Two kind of gateway exist:
*Gateway [[ethernet]] ([[Linux]] based)
*Gateway [[USB]] / [[RS232]]
These gateways are bidirectional; they translate SCS frames into OpenWebNet frames, and the other way round.
The open protocol OpenWebNet shared by [http://www.myopen-legrandgroup.com MyOpen] [[community]], let everybody to build software that interact with SCS devices. SCS protocol is a proprietary bTicino protocol. Interaction with other field bus must happen only writing software that use OpenWebNet.

'''Chantal Mouffe''' ({{IPA-fr|muf|lang}}; born 17 June 1943)&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;{{cite web |title= Mouffe, Chantal |url= http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79143499.html |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate= 25 July 2014 |quote= CIP t.p. (Chantal Mouffe) data sheet (b. 17 June 1943) }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Belgian [[political theorist]], currently teaching at [[University of Westminster]].&lt;ref name="Westminster"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/mouffe-chantal |title=Chantal Mouffe |publisher=westminster.ac.uk |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is best known for her contribution to the development—jointly with [[Ernesto Laclau]], with whom she co-authored ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]''—of the so-called [[Essex School of discourse analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;See Jules Townshend, 'Discourse theory and political analysis: a new paradigm from the Essex School?’, ''British Journal of Politics and International Relations'', Vol. 5, No. 1, February 2003, pp. 129–142, and ‘Laclau and Mouffe’s Hegemonic Project: The Story So Far’, ''Political Studies'', 52, 2004, pp. 269-288.&lt;/ref&gt; a type of [[post-Marxist]] political inquiry drawing on [[Gramsci]], post-structuralism and theories of identity, and redefining Leftist politics in terms of radical democracy and [[context free grammar]]s of power relations. Her highest cited publication is ''Hegemony and socialist strategy: Towards a radical democratic politics'' at 15309 times, according to Google Scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C44&amp;q=Chantal+Mouffe&amp;btnG= |title=Chantal Mouffe |publisher=scholar.google.com |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Chantal Mouffe studied at the Universities of [[Université catholique de Louvain|Louvain]], [[University of Paris|Paris]] and [[University of Essex|Essex]] and has worked in many universities throughout the world (in Europe, North America and Latin America). She has also held visiting positions at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] (Paris). During the 1989–1995 period she served as Programme Director at the [[Collège international de philosophie]] in Paris. She currently holds a professorship at the Department of Politics and International Relations, [[University of Westminster]] in the United Kingdom, where she directs the Centre for the Study of Democracy.&lt;ref name="Westminster"/&gt;

==Work==
A prominent critic of [[deliberative democracy]] (especially in its [[John Rawls|Rawlsian]] and [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] versions), she is also known for her critical use of the work of [[Carl Schmitt]], mainly the concept of "the political", in proposing a radicalization of modern democracy—what she calls "agonistic pluralism". She has developed an interest in highlighting the radical potential of artistic practices. Mouffe's ''Agonistics: Thinking the World Politically'' (2013) has been criticised by Timothy Laurie for its strong focus on State institutions, noting that Mouffe's "professed enthusiasm for (some) non-Western Islamist movements is solely conditional upon their assumption of State instruments".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Review: 'Agonistics: Thinking the World Politically' | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Melbourne Journal of Politics | year= 2013 | url= https://www.academia.edu/5433656}} vol. 36, pp. 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clonal colony of Iris germanica.jpg|thumb|right|A clonal colony of ''[[Iris germanica]]''-note the [[Rhizome|rhizomatious]] stems by which the plant reproduces.]]
A '''clonal colony''' or '''genet''' is a group of [[genetics|genetically]] identical individuals, such as [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], or [[bacteria]], that have grown in a given location, all originating [[vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]], not [[Sexual reproduction|sexually]], from a single ancestor. In plants, an individual in such a population is referred to as a '''ramet'''. In [[fungi]], "individuals" typically refers to the visible [[fruiting bodies]] or [[mushroom]]s that develop from a common [[mycelium]] which, although spread over a large area, is otherwise hidden in the [[soil]]. Clonal [[colony (biology)|colonies]] are common in many plant [[species]]. Although many plants [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]] through the production of [[seed]], [[plant reproduction|reproduction]] occurs by underground [[stolon]]s or [[rhizome]]s in some plants. Above ground, these plants most often appear to be distinct individuals, but underground they remain interconnected and are all clones of the same plant. However, it is not always easy to recognize a clonal colony especially if it spreads underground and is also sexually reproducing.

==Methods of establishment==
* With most [[woody plant]]s, clonal colonies arise by wide-ranging [[root]]s that at intervals send up new [[shoot]]s, termed [[basal shoot|suckers]].  
* [[Tree]]s and [[shrub]]s with [[branch]]es that may tend to bend and rest on the ground, or which possess the ability to form [[aerial root|aerial roots]] can form colonies via [[layering]], or aerial rooting, e. g. [[willow]], [[blackberry]], [[Ficus|fig]], and [[banyan]]. 
* Some [[vine]]s naturally form [[adventitious]] roots on their [[plant stem|stems]] that take root in the soil when the stems contact the ground, e.g. [[Hedera|ivy]] and [[trumpet vine]].
* With other vines, rooting of the stem where nodes come into contact with soil may establish a clonal colony, e.g. [[Wisteria]].
* [[Fern]]s and many [[herbaceous]] [[flowering plant]]s often form clonal colonies via horizontal underground stems termed [[rhizome]]s, e.g. ostrich fern ''[[Matteuccia struthiopteris]]'' and [[goldenrod]].
* A number of herbaceous flowering plants form clonal colonies via horizontal surface stems termed [[stolon]]s, or runners; e.g. [[strawberry]] and many [[grass]]es.
* Non-woody plants with underground [[storage organ]]s such as [[bulb]]s and [[corm]]s can also form colonies, e.g. ''[[Narcissus (genus)|Narcissus]]'' and ''[[Crocus]]''.
* A few plant species can form colonies via adventitious [[plantlet]]s that form on leaves, e.g. ''[[Kalanchoe daigremontiana]]'' and ''[[Tolmiea menziesii]]''.
* A few plant species can form colonies via asexual seeds, termed [[apomixis]], e.g. [[dandelion]].

==Record colonies==
The only known natural example of [[King's Lomatia]] (''Lomatia tasmanica'') found growing in the wild is a clonal colony in [[Tasmania]] estimated to be 43,600 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1996/10/21/01.asp |title=Tasmanian bush could be oldest living organism |accessdate=2008-05-07 |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723041627/http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1996/10/21/01.asp |archivedate=2006-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A group of 47,000 [[Quaking Aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') trees (nicknamed "[[Pando (tree)|Pando]]") in the [[Wasatch Mountains]], [[Utah]], United States, has been shown to be a single clone connected by the root system. It is sometimes considered the world's [[largest organism]] by [[mass]], covering {{convert|106|acres}}, and also as amongst the world's oldest living organisms, at an estimated 80,000 years old.  It is possible that other unknown clonal colonies of trees rival or exceed its size and/ or age.

Another possible candidate for [[list of long-living organisms|oldest organism]] on [[earth]] is an underwater meadow of the [[marine botany|marine plant]] ''[[Posidonia oceanica]]'' in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which could be up to 100,000 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/node/76071 |title=Ibiza's Monster Marine Plant |accessdate=2008-05-07 |publisher=Ibiza Spotlight }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
When woody plants form clonal colonies, they often remain connected through the root system, sharing roots, water and [[plant nutrition|mineral nutrients]]. A few non-vining, woody plants that form clonal colonies are:
*[[Aspen]], Quaking, ''Populus tremuloides''
*[[Bayberry]], ''Myrica pensylvanica''
*[[Black locust]], ''Robinia pseudoacacia''
*[[Creosote bush]], ''Larrea tridentata'' 
*[[Staphylea|Bladdernut]], ''Staphylea'' species
*[[Blueberry]], ''Vaccinium'' species
*[[Devil's Club]] Oplopanax horridus
*[[Forsythia]], ''Forsythia'' species
*[[Hazelnut]], ''Corylus'' species
*[[Honey locust]], ''Gleditsia triacanthos''
*[[Kentucky coffeetree]], ''Gymnocladus dioicus''
*[[Kerria (plant)|Kerria]], ''Kerria japonica''

'''Critical terrorism studies''' ('''CTS''') applies a [[critical theory]] approach rooted in [[counter-hegemonic]] and politically progressive critical theory to the study of [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21"&gt;Jackson, R., Jarvis, L., Gunning, J., &amp; Breen-Smyth, M. (2011). Terrorism: A critical introduction. London, UK: Palgrave Macmillian&lt;/ref&gt; With links to the [[Frankfurt School]] of critical theory and the [[Aberystwyth School]] of critical security studies, CTS seeks to understand terrorism as a [[social construction]], or a label, that is applied to certain violent acts through a range of political, legal and academic processes.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; It also seeks to understand and critique dominant forms of counter-terrorism.

== Description ==

Following the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]]; there has been a massive increase in research related to terrorism. Terrorism has become one of the most powerful signifiers in contemporary society with the term generating vast amounts of social and political activity.  It has also become a cultural taboo which invokes emotions – fear and hatred.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35"&gt;Smyth, M.B., Gunning, J., Jackson, R. Kassimeris, G. &amp; Robinson, P. (2008). "Critical terrorism studies – an introduction". ''Critical Studies on Terrorism'', 1(1), 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS takes issue with previous terrorism studies in what it perceives as having methodological and analytical weaknesses, including a reliance on poor research methods and procedures, an overreliance on secondary resources, and a failure to undertake primary research; a failure to come up with an accepted definition of terrorism, and an inability to be cross-disciplinary. According to Jeroen Gunning: "core epistemological, methodological and political-normative problems persist, ranging from lack of conceptual clarity and theoretical sterility to political bias and a continuing dearth of primary research data".&lt;ref name="Gunning. A Case for 12"&gt;Gunning, J. (2007a). A case for critical terrorism studies? Government and opposition, 42(3), pp. 363-393.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS is a response to these research problems. With its origins in the Frankfurt School of critical theory, and the Welsh School of critical security studies (in which the primary referent to be secured is individuals not states), CTS is a self-reflective, critical approach to the study of terrorism which challenges the ontological, epistemological and ideological commitments of mainstream terrorism scholars.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; CTS also looks to attract academics from other disciplines who are uncomfortable with the mainstream discourse around terrorism and looks to engage directly with those who are perceived as 'terrorists' and/or terrorist sympathisers.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;

CTS aims to approach terrorism studies from a critical angle, that is, to encourage and further the adoption of a more self-consciously critical approach to the study of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. Research Agenda 20"&gt;Jackson, R., Breen Smyth, M., &amp; Gunning, J. (Eds.).(2009). Critical terrorism studies: A new research agenda. Abingdon, UK: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; However CTS does not only criticise the state of terrorism studies, it also attempts to "suggest an alternative way of studying terrorism and a concrete research agenda for the future".&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; While critical approaches to the study of terrorism are not new,&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. Research Agenda 20"/&gt; previous efforts have often occurred outside of the terrorism studies field. Such as the critical approach that some anthropology scholars have taken. These alternative approaches have "had little cross-fertilization with the orthodox field and have largely failed to alter its practices, priorities, approaches, outputs and myths".&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; CTS seeks to engage directly with the orthodox field,&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; and question its normative assumptions. Prompted by the growing unease over the state of current terrorism research, and the relationship between much orthodox terrorism research and the institutions of state power, CTS sets out to "stimulate, encourage, and more clearly articulate the nascent but observable 'critical turn' that was starting to become visible within the broader terrorism studies field".&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. Research Agenda 20"/&gt;

CTS scholars argue that terrorism should be de-exceptionalised as a form of political violence, not singled out as a unique form of "evil" violence, but  should be treated as other forms of political violence are.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; CTS also encourages researchers to engage with terrorists as humans, and not form explanations of terrorists in an [[Other (philosophy)|'Othering']] sense.&lt;ref name="Gunning. A Case for 12"/&gt; Therefore; "Ultimately, a critical approach to terrorism suggests that more positive and progressive change is always possible and that we can break out of seemingly endless cycles of terrorist/counter-terrorist violence, if only we can begin to think, study, speak and act outside of the dominant terrorism paradigm."&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;

== History ==

CTS's antecedents lie with scholars such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Edward S. Herman|Edward Herman]], who published critical works relating to the state and terrorism from the late 1970s. One of the first major works that gave impetus to a CTS discourse was [[Joseba Zulaika]] and William Douglass's&lt;ref name=" Zulaika 43 "&gt;Zulaika, J., (2012). "Drones, Witches and other Flying Objects: the Force of Fantasy in US Counterterrorism". ''Critical Studies on Terrorism'', 5(1), 51-68&lt;/ref&gt; seminal work, ''Terror and Taboo: The Follies, Fables, and Faces of Terrorism''. This book was a critical appraisal of  many of the international community's commonly-held assumptions about terrorism. A further catalyst for CTS came from Richard Jackson's 2005 book, ''Writing the War on Terrorism''. Jackson called for scholars to resist the current terrorism studies discourse: "I believe we have an ethical duty to resist the discourse, to deconstruct it at every opportunity and continually to interrogate the exercise of power".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. (2005) Writing the War on Terror: Language, politics and counter-terrorism. Manchester University Press, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; The setting up of the Critical Studies on Terrorism Working Group (CSTWG) within the [[British International Studies Association]] (BISA) occurred in early 2006, while in October 2006, a conference was held entitled; 'Is it time for a critical terrorism studies?' This was followed by two journal articles that called for a critical appraisal of the current state of terrorism studies. Richard Jackson's "Introduction: The Case for Critical Terrorism Studies" and Jeroen Gunning's "A case for Critical Terrorism Studies". In his "A case for Critical Terrorism Studies", Gunning calls for a critical approach that will "encourage researchers to historicize and contextualize the conflict by looking at the evolution of violence, broader processes of [[radicalization]], the relationship between violent organizations and wider social movements, and the relationship between social movements and the state."&lt;ref name="Gunning. A Case for 12" /&gt;

The setting up of the journal ''Critical Studies in Terrorism'' occurred in early 2007. The idea behind launching the journal was "one small part of a much broader attempt to foster a more self-reflective, critical approach to the study of terrorism, and bring in those who study aspects of 'terrorism', but are uncomfortable with or hostile to the (perceived) [[Ontology|ontological]], [[Epistemology|epistemological]], and [[Ideology|ideological]] commitments of existing terrorism studies."&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; CTS has continued to expand as a sub-discipline of terrorism studies and there has been a growth of CTS programs in universities such as [[Aberystwyth University]], the [[University of Kent]] and the [[University of Manchester]]. Other courses also exist within peace studies and politics programmes in universities such as [[Otago University]], [[Durham University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Virginia Tech]], [[University of Florida]], and [[Queens University Belfast]]. A major milestone in CTS will be the ''Handbook of Critical Terrorism Studies'' due to be published by [[Routledge]] in 2015.

== Ontological and epistemological foundations ==

===Two ontological critical theories===
* Critical realism: Observer and observed, or subject and object, are distinctly separate (For a clear alternative discussion on critical realism and CTS, see: Stump and Dixit 2013, 2011). 
* [[Reflectivism]]: Observer and observed or subject and object are deeply interconnected (For a more reflective discourse see: Jackson, Javis, Gunning, Smyth 2009&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;).
There has been a huge amount of academic discussion about the [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] foundations of critical terrorism studies. Within CTS, there is a broad agreement on the need to examine terrorism and terrorists from a historical, contextualized perspective asking 'how' questions of causation and constitution, rather than the more orthodox problem solving questions of a single isolated event. For instance, CTS questions why a terrorist action happens, asking whether the terrorists simply hate western notions of freedom, or whether they have deeper underlying political motivations?  CTS adopts the ontological position that "terrorism" is fundamentally a social fact rather than brute fact.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;

===Epistemological perspective===
* Critical realism: best approximation to objective world.
* [[Reflexivism]]: tool for inducing self-reflection of individuals and groups. Not static and monolithic.
CTS adopts the epistemological position that the nature of knowledge in terrorism studies is a social process which relies on contextual factors, including the influence of the researcher. CTS scholars argue that by being continuously aware of context, social processes, and the 'known' and 'unknown' knowledge in circulation, you can gain further insights into the study of terrorism. CTS also acknowledges the link between power and knowledge, and who research is ultimately for.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;

===Overview of research areas===
* With the focus on epistemological understanding, it is now possible to question how we receive knowledge and who it benefits and why. 
* Examining the constructed information flow produced through academic research, basic education, political rhetoric, state and international law, and media. Reframing the discourse through a reflexive epistemology. 
* Human security over state security/national security. Move away from state-centric policies on security, to focusing on people and liberty.
* [[Emancipation]]: whose voice is marginalized or silenced, whose voice is empowered in defining terrorism, and what should the response to it be in particular contexts?&lt;ref name="McDonald 25"&gt;McDonald, M., 2007. Emancipation and critical terrorism studies. European Political Science, 6 (3), 252–259.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gender: the misconception that typically women are seen as victims of political violence and men as perpetrators.
* Gendering serves to maintain gender hierarchy and reinforces essentialist stereotypes of women as peaceful and powerless.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; Reframing women's interaction with terrorism and violence.
* Study of political terror (violence), state terrorism, structural violence and cultural violence.
* Exploring the extent to which the status quo contributes to the problem of terrorism.    "Whom defines terrorism?  Whom defines terrorist? Whom defines the dominant response?".&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; 
* [[State terrorism]] and [[counter-terrorism]]: creating the conditions of oppositional violence. To analyse the way traditional terrorism discourse is used to discredit oppositional groups and justify state policies. The applying of historical materialist approaches to systematic research of state terrorism has started to be critically assessed by [[Michael Stohl]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Richard Jackson (sociologist)|Richard Jackson]], [[Ruth Blakeley]] and others.

== Major differences from orthodox terrorism studies ==

CTS differs from [[:wikt:orthodox|orthodox]]/traditional terrorism studies (OTS) in several fundamental ways. Some of the most significant points of difference include its emphasis on the utilization of [[critical theory]] in research, its focus on removing the bias of [[ethnocentrism]] from all research, its goal to facilitate the spread of [[emancipation]] of peoples previously marginalized in traditional terrorism studies, and its attempt to avoid political bias and a problem-solving policy-orientation.

===Utilization of critical theory===
Scholars created CTS in response to what they felt was missing from traditional terrorism studies, namely, the critical aspect of research.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; Employing critical thinking in terrorism research can mean employing any one of several existing critical theories (such as [[Derrida]]'s [[deconstruction]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s [[post-structuralism]], or [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]]'s [[structuralism]], etc.) But, in a broader sense, it simply means researching and writing to challenge commonly held social, political, and personal beliefs about terrorism that often go unchallenged (specifically in traditional terrorism studies).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R., 2007a. "Symposium: Introduction: the case for critical terrorism studies". ''European Political Science'', 6 (3), 225–227.&lt;/ref&gt; OTS scholars agree that critical thinking and the utilization of critical theory should be a prominent aspect of any valuable research.&lt;ref&gt;Ranstorp, M., ed., 2006. ''Mapping terrorism research: state of the art, gaps and future directions''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rengger, N. and Thirkell-White, B., 2007. "Still critical after all these years? The past, present and future of critical theory in international relations". ''Review of International Studies'', 33, 3–24.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they also feel that such research already exists within the field of terrorism studies and that CTS is bringing more of a critical eye to the field, but that there is no cause for it to be a whole separate sub-field.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; However, unlike traditional terrorism studies, CTS is strict on its adherence to the critical element of research, as it believes critical analysis is one of the few ways to overcome the problematic gaps within traditional terrorism studies.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17"&gt;Jackson, R., 2007b. The core commitments of critical terrorism studies. European Political Science, 6 (3), 244–251.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS also hopes that the critical element will also eventually bridge the traditional and critical approaches, if both begin to follow the research procedures that allow critical analysis.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt;

===Removing ethnocentrism===
CTS attempts to combat what they feel is a prevalent state-centricity and [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentricity]] in traditional terrorism studies.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, J., 2006. Overblown: how politicians and the terrorism industry inflate national security threats and why we believe them. New York, NY: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent scholars Jackson, Gunning and Smyth claim that since most research on terrorism is done by [[state-sponsored]] scholars and experts, there is a disproportionate amount of research articulating states' perspectives and experiences (namely western state-actors), leaving almost all non-state actors without any fair, unbiased representation in the research field.&lt;ref name="Silke 33"&gt;Silke, A., ed., 2004. Research on terrorism: trends, achievements and failures. London: Frank Cass.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, CTS challenges state-centric or ethnocentric research by responding directly to already published research, finding holes and gaps in the arguments,&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; and by completing new research that challenges ethnocentric claims and provides new claims from the perspective of non-state entities, and specifically, the perspectives of the so-labeled 'terrorists' themselves.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; OTS scholars see this shift from so-called "[[state centrism]]" as obvious and not wholly necessary. Bias is unavoidable and viewing it as such has the possibility to weaken arguments already made.&lt;ref name="Silke 33" /&gt; Also, there is not a complete lack of ethnocentric-free research within terrorism studies and therefore CTS is seen as simply creating a bifurcation between the subfields.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Silke 33" /&gt; Despite this criticism, CTS remains determined to conduct research free from state-centric and ethnocentric perspectives, opening space for new perspectives and discourses that may have been overlooked by terrorism studies as a whole.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt;

===Facilitating the spread of emancipation===
When referring to the [[emancipation|emancipatory]] nature of research, CTS is referring not only to the emancipation of previously marginalized peoples' voices in the field of OTS, but the emancipation of ideas, questions and theories that have been marginalized, overlooked, or seen as non-issues in orthodox studies. A simple way to understand CTS's emancipation is to think of it as a process of creating space and discussion that allows the focus to be on experiences, ideas and questions which have been "neglected in most orthodox accounts of security and terrorism".&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; The emancipation of ideas, dialogue, and experience is a powerful "philosophical anchorage"&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; that allows CTS to separate itself and its motives from that of traditional and orthodox terrorism studies. Traditional terrorism studies theorists understand the value behind the idea of emancipatory nature of CTS's research, but many feel such a claim is overstated.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15"&gt;Horgan, J. &amp; Boyle, M. J., (2008). A case against 'Critical Terrorism Studies', Critical Studies on Terrorism, 1:1, 51-64, DOI: 10.1080/17539150701848225.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS's claim of emancipation is seen as simply reinventing the wheel, a wheel that has been working effectively for orthodox scholars for decades. And the claim&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; to be the first in a field as politically charged and somewhat emotionally delicate as terrorism studies to ask hard questions and challenge commonly held beliefs and assumptions is seen as a gross over-simplification and generalization that risks replacing one dominant discourse with another, and in turn,  marginalizing the research and voices of traditional terrorism studies.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, J., 2007. The rise and rise of terrorism studies. The Guardian, 3 July.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite traditional terrorism studies' negative response to CTS's emancipatory claim, CTS still strives to keep emancipation as one of its core motivations for continued research.&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; Emancipatory research in terrorism studies can bring to light overlooked perspectives such as the war in Iraq being a form of occupation bringing more violence than peace,&lt;ref&gt;Fontan, V., 2006. Polarization between occupier and occupied in post-Saddam Iraq: humiliation and the formation of political violence. Terrorism and Political Violence, 18, 217–238.&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that State sponsored research is often biased and unreliable&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; and that any and all valuable research should be conducted free of political bias to truly increase understanding.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt; These few listed ideas are examples of what CTS hopes to bring to the field of terrorism studies through emancipatory research.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;

===Freedom from policy===
One of the largest voids of orthodox terrorism studies CTS aims to fill is the void of politically neutral and policy-free research and ideas.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; Post-9/11, almost all research on terrorism has been sponsored and conducted by [[state-actors]], many standing to gain politically from the conclusions drawn from such research.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnett 5"&gt;Burnett, J. &amp; Whyte, D. (2005). Embedded expertise and the new terrorism. Journal for Crime, Conflict and the Media, 1(4), 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS feels that the prominent discourse maintained by State-sponsored terrorism research contributes to the justification of [[state terrorism]] and de-legitimizes any argument that would challenge or condemn such actions.&lt;ref name="Sluka 34"&gt;Sluka, J., 2000. "Introduction: State terror and anthropology" in J. Sluka, ed. ''Death squad: The anthropology of state terror''. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when research is sponsored for political reasons, the 'experts' become not those who have the most relevant experience, but those who are willing to support whatever political view that will result in more funding, and those who are willing to adhere to any current policy around terrorism (e.g. "Our country does not negotiate with terrorists" therefore all research reflects the impossibility of negotiating with terrorist).&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, C., 2006. In the name of terrorism: presidents on political violence in the post-World War II era. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox terrorism studies researchers see the idea of political and policy neutral research as a nice sentiment, but impossible to execute.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt; Many have criticized CTS for claiming policy free and politically neutral research, as even the word terrorism itself is not free of any political meaning and connotation.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt; And since many scholars study and research the causes, effects, and nature of terrorism because of passionate ideas and interests, it would be irresponsible to assert that simply because a piece of research is free of state centricism and bias that it is automatically politically neutral.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; Again, traditional terrorism studies sees CTS's research attempts as oversimplifications to claim innovation in an already established field.

However, CTS sees the criticism from orthodox scholars as extenuating the need for there to be more than one avenue of academic discourse available.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; By aiming to keep all research politically neutral and policy free, a space opens up for experts with non-state experience to enter a field which was previously unavailable to them.&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; And again, politically neutral scholars are more able to bring to attention and help fight acts of state terrorism that are often overlooked and even justified in orthodox studies.&lt;ref name="Sluka 34" /&gt;

===Traditional terrorism studies' response===
CTS's new approach and perspective has been widely welcomed in the field of terrorism studies. Nevertheless, it has  been subject to criticism for its desire to distinguish itself from what it deems "traditional" or "orthodox" terrorism studies, and for its claim of maintaining absolute political neutrality. However, scholars both from critical and traditional terrorism studies remain determined not to allow any distinction between the subfields to cause bifurcation and incompatibility within the field of research itself.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt;

== CTS's main critiques of traditional terrorism studies ==

CTS would not have come into existence unless scholars saw the need for a change in many of the perspectives within terrorism studies as a whole.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; Some of the most common criticisms CTS consistently presents including the inconsistent 'definition' of terrorism, the political power held by most Orthodox scholars, the ineffectiveness of the War on Terror, the glorification of patriotism, and the demonising narrative of the 'enemy'.

===Definitions of terrorism===
The term "terrorism" gained prominence during the [[French Revolution]] when it was used by the Jacobins to kill known supporters of the [[Ancien Régime]], and to eliminate those labeled enemies of the revolution.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40"&gt;Wilkinson, P. (2012). "The Utility of the Concept of Terrorism" in R. Jackson and S. J. Sinclair (eds.), ''Contemporary Debates on Terrorism'', Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the state was the first proponent of using terrorism as a political tool.&lt;ref&gt;Stohl, M. (2008). Old myths, new fantasies and the enduring realities of terrorism, Critical Studies on Terrorism, 1:1, 5-16, DOI: 10.1080/17539150701846443.&lt;/ref&gt; Moving into the twentieth century, the regimes of [[Nazi Germany]] and Soviet Russia, through the use of secret police, used tension to subdue and kill those deemed enemies of the state. Further, a number of Latin American states backed by the US utilised state-terrorism to silence the population and consolidate their control – Chile and Nicaragua in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Pilger, J. (1994). ''Distant Voices'' (rev. ed.). London: Vintage.&lt;/ref&gt;  Up until this point, terrorism was largely, though not exclusively, defined by its use by state. And it was not until later that academic circles shifted the focus to non-state actors.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt; There is research to suggest that states that have witnessed severe upheaval throughout their history will utilise state-terrorism. Such as Iraq, Syria, Israel, Burundi, Rwanda, Zaire, Myanmar, Indonesia, Serbia and Chechnya.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt; Furthermore, for weak states, state terrorism is often viewed as a legitimate total state consolidation.

Terrorism therefore has a number of meanings and interpretations that we can use to assess terrorist acts in the contemporary era. Terrorism is a heavily contested concept and it is the context in which a violent act occurs as to how people define the act. It is symbolic violence, a communicative act, with the sole purpose to send the message. It is the psychological effect of using fear, as it is not the victims of a terrorist act. But the wider audience who are the target, because the victims become instrumental as they are the message carriers.

* Generic terrorism: "The systematic use of violence and intimidation to coerce a government or community, into acceding to specific political demands."&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, J., and Trumble, B., eds, (2006). Oxford Referencing Dictionary, 2nd ed., revised, Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the use of or the threat of violence that is meant to intimidate a wider target than the immediate victims of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt;
* Non-state terrorism: Involves attacks on civilians, symbolic and random targets and is usually, though not exclusively, aimed at bringing about political change.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt;
* [[Religious terrorism]]: Political violence in the name of religion by religiously motivated people. A problematic term that is used to categorise terrorism and differentiate it from other forms of terrorism, by assuming there is a casual relationship between religion and violence, rather than looking at the study of beliefs and practices in the production of political violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gunning, J., and Jackson, R. (2011). "What's so 'religious' about 'religious terrorism'?", ''Critical Studies on Terrorism'', 4:3, 369-388, DOI: 10.1080/17539153.2011.623405.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[State terrorism]]: Involves the intimidation of the civilian population into submission. This occurs when a third-party is used to silence dissidents, and kill people, instilling fear in the population.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt;

===Links to power===
A CTS critique of OTS revolves around many OTS scholars' links to institutions of power. CTS questions these links to [[hegemonic]] actors and structures from the [[global North]] that can be seen to be furthering the agendas of certain states, because OTS is a discipline that is primarily concerned with looking at acts of terrorism by non-state actors. This is a very state-centric perspective which has a limited set of assumptions and narratives about the nature and cause of terrorism. Moreover, this becomes accepted as the general consensus at the macro, meso and micro levels of government and institutions, and is reflected in policy and the way the mainstream view terrorism. Traditional terrorism studies is also largely concerned with "problem solving theory", which looks at the world "with the prevailing social and power relationships and the institutions into which they are organised, as the given framework for action", and then works to "make these relationships and institutions work smoothly by dealing effectively with particular sources of trouble".&lt;ref&gt;Cox, R. (1981). Social forces, states and world orders: Beyond international relations theory. Millennium: Journal of International Studies, 10(2), 126-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they look at dealing with the issue of terrorism within the current dominant structures of power. An example of this is the scholars and associated research that is affiliated with the [[RAND Corporation]]. Now an independent think tank, RAND was established by the US air force in 1945, and was contracted to the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. It has maintained close links with US administrations, and former board members include [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and [[Condoleezza Rice]], both leading members of the [[George W. Bush]] administration.&lt;ref name="Blakeley 4"&gt;Blakeley, R. (2009). ''State Terrorism and Neoliberalism: The north in the south''. London, UK: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The major problem with this association with government is that it privileges research on threats by non-state actors, and marginalises research around state sponsorship of terrorism. According to Burnett and Whyte, the Corporation acts "effectively as an influential prestigious voice in the American military-industrial lobby and in world politics; particularly with regard to its interventions on the war on terror". Scholars, or "embedded experts"&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; associated with RAND have key editorial positions in the two most prominent English-language terrorism journals, ''Terrorism and Political Violence'' and ''Conflict and Terrorism''. RAND scholars helped to found the [[St Andrew Centre for Studies in Terrorism and Political Violence (CSTPV)]], the leading centre for the study of terrorism in the UK.&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; As well, experts associated with the RAND-St Andrews nexus have significant professional ties with businesses and military personal associated with counter-terrorism activity, many of which have made "windfall profits" in the Iraq conflict.&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt;

== The War on Terror ==

On [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks | 19 terrorists]]&lt;ref name="Pape 27"&gt;Pape. R. (2005) ''Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism''. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– in association with [[Al-Qaeda]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks|hijacked four commercial planes and flew them]] into the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)| World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], [[The Pentagon]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], and a field near [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania]]. The number of deaths is estimated at 2996 casualties.&lt;ref name="http 49"&gt;http://owni.eu/2011/05/05/the-war-on-terror-in-numbers/&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, President [[George W. Bush]] declared a [[War on Terror]] to prevent any more terrorist attacks on the Western world. Bush immediately framed these terrorists as being motivated by [[Islamic extremism]]; an evil, destructive and repressive people who America refused to negotiate with and must defeat (45). The estimates of how many thousands of civilians, insurgents, soldiers (both American and otherwise) and Islamists that have been killed in the war on terror vary widely from 220,000&lt;ref name="http 49" /&gt; to 650,000.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; However these statistics are unreliable due to their varied date, source and amount – it is not possible to know how many people have been victims of the war on terror. Not only has this war killed, tortured and displaced hundreds of thousands of people, there is no proof that it has been effective in reducing terrorism, and has led to a further proliferation of terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name="Lum 24"&gt;Lum, C., Kennedy, L. W., &amp; Sherley, A. (2006).  Are counter-terrorism strategies effective?&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bush Doctrine===
{{main article|The Bush Doctrine}}
The rationality behind Bush's decision to start a war on terrorism comes in four parts. First it was implemented as a preventive war, and as an excuse to act pre-emptively. Second, it was based on unilateralism, although where necessary, Bush attempted to enlist support from the international community. Third, there was an element of idealism that believed that war would help to spread democracy, human rights and liberties. And lastly, Bush endeavoured to maintain American hegemony by reaffirming the vital role of American military strength.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; It is argued that the negative effects of this war will be felt for generations, due to the culture of division, stereotyping and hate between the Middle East and the West. The formation of a new "suspect community" in the Middle East has undermined human rights and civil liberties, and impaired the functionality of the international system.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; [[Just war theory]] stands as the main justification for the war on terror. This means that new technologies and methods in war are legalized. The [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] is viewed by many CTS scholars as an act of terror.&lt;ref name="Keen 23"&gt;Keen, D. (2006). War without end? Magic, Propaganda and the hidden functions of counter-terror. Journal of International Development, 18(1), p. 87-104&lt;/ref&gt; Terror on terror makes no sense,&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; and did not produce positive results. The attack on Iraq  was illogical considering America's past partnership with Iraq, the whereabouts of [[Al-Qaeda]]'s base and [[Osama bin Laden]] in Afghanistan, and also the men who attacked the twin towers were from Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="Pape 27" /&gt;  American power internationally meant that they authorized the attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan, and also drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. While Bush legitimises the enemy by asserting that terrorists want to 'kill all Americans',&lt;ref name="https 45"&gt;ConspiracyWorld (September 3, 2010). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CSPbzitPL8 "Sept. 20, 2001 - Bush Declares War on Terror"]. ''[[YouTube]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no discernable difference between this falsified aim and the goal of American Military intervention in the Middle East. [[Barack Obama]] has continued the Bush-instigated War on Terror by plainly stating that the biggest threat to America is still terrorism.&lt;ref name="http 48"&gt;http://america.aljazeera.com/blogs/scrutineer/2014/5/29/obama-west-pointspeech.html&lt;/ref&gt;  So, despite the reduction of military occupation in the Middle East, the trace of War on Terror still remains.&lt;ref name="http 48" /&gt;

===Counter-insurgency failures===
The overall ineffective and illegitimate result of the war on terror means that the costs have thus far outweighed the successes. [[Counter-terrorism]] efforts such as [[Targeted killing]] and [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone strikes]] have backfired and are not proven to work, and have even perpetuated the number of terrorist attacks, including [[Suicide attacks|suicide bombings]].&lt;ref name="Lum 24" /&gt; While counter-terrorism may deter some attacks, it cannot prevent all, and often has the result of provoking rather than reducing terrorism. The [[Iraq War]] was not productive in countering terrorism.&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; Upward of 60 examples of terrorist incidents in America are proven consequences of United States foreign policy and military intervention.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/fpb50.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Still, no academic scholar in orthodox terrorism studies has considered American military intervention as the primary problem.&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; It is noted that at [[Faisal Shahzad]]'s trial – following his failed [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]] – he cited the drones that were killing the people of his community as the reason for his vengeance.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Unmanned drone attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan tend to target public places and gatherings, such as weddings and funerals, and are increasing the threat of terrorism. Violence emanates and results from counterinsurgency/terrorism. What America calls preventative war, the Middle East calls state terrorism.&lt;ref name="Aretxaga 1"&gt;Aretxaga, B. (2001). "Terror as a thrill: First thoughts on the 'war on terrorism'." ''Anthropological Quarterly'', 75(1), p.138–150&lt;/ref&gt;

===The War on Terror and patriotism===
Throughout American history, military strength has been at the heart of identity; it is embedded in politics and culture. War as a solution is rooted in American culture, as [[The War of Independence]] and [[World War Two|World War II]] are referred to as successes and justifications for future war.&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; Rather than concentrating resources and money on problems that have widespread negative effects on American society, like poverty, education, health or the environment, the United States has spent US$1.283 trillion since 9/11 on military interventions internationally.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/rl33110.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotype of the enemy is perpetuated and normalized through American culture, media, entertainment and politics. And the shared hate for the enemy contributes to a unified patriotism within America that deflects attention from the deeply entrenched inequalities within the nation.&lt;ref name="Aretxaga 1" /&gt; The war on terror acts as a distraction mechanism from local problems in the Western world, and maintains a war culture of its own that produces justifications and legitimate rationality for prolonging the war in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Bayoumi, M. (2008). Endless War? Hidden Functions of the 'War on Terror' by David Keen. Development and Change. 39(5), p.870-871.&lt;/ref&gt; The patriotism that the war on terror creates contributes to large sources of revenue for the American military industrial economy through [[mass surveillance]], weapon suppliers, the [[CIA]], military personnel and orthodox terrorism academics.&lt;ref&gt;Zalman, A., &amp; Clarke, J. (2009). The Global War on Terror: A Narrative in Need of a Rewrite. Ethics &amp; International Affairs, 23(2), p.101-113,89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating a narrative of the enemy===
The culture of war is created through the imagery and language used in politics and popular entertainment in order to frame a narrative of the enemy. [[Islam]] and [[Muslims]] have been constructed as a dangerous other in Western culture. Not only do politicians&amp;nbsp;– especially in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]&amp;nbsp;– inform the public of this enemy, this fictional reality is reinforced through journalism and entertainment in which the war is framed as inevitable and the enemy as evil.&lt;ref name="Aretxaga 1" /&gt; This all reinforces the fantasy that this war is about fighting evil in general, and the Western soldiers that are killed are fighting for a greater good. The hyperbolic, dramatic language used in the media casts the Western world as heroes who fight the villains. CTS reflects on who this narrative of the enemy benefits. This perception that reinforces patriotism and justifications for war, profits the Western world and furthers the dominance and oppression that divides the two regions.
When the motives and ideology of terrorists are largely unknown – let alone the number and whereabouts – the greater the possibility is to rely on stereotype and myth-based discourse.&lt;ref name="http 44"&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-brenner/terror-americas-archetype_b_5784166.html?ir=WorldPost&lt;/ref&gt; Because the enemy is foreign (even alien) this possibility is increased due to limited knowledge and physical connection to the region. When reality falls short, the narrative of foreign peoples is shaped by "shortcuts provided by stylized imagery compounded of stories, films and our own imaginations".&lt;ref name="http 44" /&gt; Politicians use this to back up their dehumanized claims, so the image of the terrorist mimics [[Osama bin Laden]] with the beard, turban, black eyes and hollow glum face creating a stereotyped stigma. This enemy is merciless, believes in extreme religious values and will do anything to destroy the West. Such imagery and language degrades common humanity, and prevents us from understanding that the enemy is a human who is victimized.

===Terrorism and mobilities===
[[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]] was a pioneer in discussing the paradigms of mobilities within the age of terror. Per his viewpoint, terrorism operates in a world of contrasting complexities where the power, far from being static, flows. The power is mobile in the same way, its gravity-effects on the world of consumption. Terrorism divides the world in two safe and unsafe zones.&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. (2002). The global complexities of September 11th. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, 19(4), 57-69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. (2005). The complexities of the global. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, 22(5), 235-254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. (2005). The complexity turn. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, 22(5), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Over past decades, many voices alerted on the negative effects of terrorism over the industry of tourism and mobilities in developed and underdeveloped economies.&lt;ref&gt;Sönmez, S. F., Apostolopoulos, Y., &amp; Tarlow, P. (1999). Tourism in crisis: Managing the effects of terrorism. Journal of Travel Research, 38(1), 13-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergent theories explained terrorism as an indicator of the lack of democracy, or even extreme poverty which represents a fertile ground for ethnic resentment necessary to rechannel terrorism. Since tourists are ambassadors of first World, not surprisingly they were targets of terrorist cells in zones dotted with lower levels of security.&lt;ref&gt;Pizam, A., &amp; Smith, G. (2000). Tourism and terrorism: A quantitative analysis of major terrorist acts and their impact on tourism destinations. Tourism Economics, 6(2), 123-138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mansfeld, Y., &amp; Pizam, A.

Kyklos, 45(4), 531-554.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some other scholars questioned this idea considering that tourism recovers its attraction and growth after elapsed little time from the original event;&lt;ref&gt;Fleischer, A., &amp; Buccola, S. (2002). War, terror, and the tourism market in Israel. Applied Economics, 34(11), 1335-1343.&lt;/ref&gt; or even producing "traumaescape" which means zones whipped by terrorism that becomes tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;Bégin, R. (2014). Digital Traumascape From the Trümmerfilme to Wall e. Space and Culture, 17(4), 379-387.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sociological studies focus on the concept of [[Thana-Tourism]] or [[Dark tourism]] to denote a connection of terrorism and tourist consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Tzanelli, R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1618">In [[physics]] and in [[electronic engineering]], '''dark current''' is the relatively small [[electric current]] that flows through [[photodetector|photosensitive devices]] such as a [[photomultiplier tube]], [[photodiode]], or [[charge-coupled device]] even when no [[photon]]s are entering the device; it consists of the charges generated in the detector when no outside radiation is entering the detector.&lt;ref name=PIT&gt;''Dark Current and Influence of Target Emissivity'', Photonics &amp; Imaging Technology, September 2016, pp. 11-14 [http://www.techbriefsmediagroup.com/magazines/photonics-imaging-technology]&lt;/ref&gt; It is referred to as [[reverse bias]] [[leakage current]] in non-optical devices and is present in all [[diode]]s. Physically, dark current is due to the random generation of [[electron]]s and [[electron hole|holes]] within the [[depletion region]] of the device.

The charge generation rate is related to specific [[crystallographic defect]]s within the depletion region. Dark-current [[spectroscopy]] can be used to determine the defects present by monitoring the peaks in the dark current histogram's evolution with temperature.

Dark current is one of the main sources for noise in [[image sensor]]s such as charge-coupled devices. The pattern of different dark currents can result in a [[fixed-pattern noise]]; [[dark frame subtraction]] can remove an estimate of the mean fixed pattern, but there still remains a temporal noise, because the dark current itself has a [[shot noise]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7674">{{canon law}}
A '''decree''' ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: '''''decretum''''', from ''decerno'', "I judge")  is, in a general sense, an order or law made by a superior authority for the direction of others. In the usage of the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], it has various meanings. Any [[papal Bull]], [[papal brief|Brief]], or [[Motu Proprio]] is a decree inasmuch as these documents are legislative acts of the [[Pope]]. In this sense the term is quite ancient.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Pope Siricius]] speaks (Ep. i, ad Himer., c. ii) of the ''decreta generalia'' of [[Pope Liberius]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Congregations]] were formerly empowered to issue decrees in matters which come under their particular jurisdiction, but were forbidden from continuing to do so under [[Pope Benedict XV]] in 1917. Each [[ecclesiastical province]], and also each [[diocese]] may issue decrees in their periodical [[synods]] within their sphere of authority. 
==Canon 29 definition==
{{further|Jurisprudence of canon law #Lex}}
Canon 29 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law offers a definition of general decrees:
{{quote|General decrees, by which a competent legislator makes common provisions for a community capable of receiving a law, are true laws and are regulated by the provisions of the canons on laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P4.HTM Canon 29], [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]; accessed 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The canon reproduces substantial elements (later deleted) of the original draft of what would become canon 7.&lt;ref name=Exegetical261&gt;''Exegetical commentary'', pg. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; This canon incorporates a definition which takes its inspiration from [[Thomas Aquinas]]' definition of human law found in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]''.&lt;ref name=Exegetical261/&gt;

==Codifications==
{{see also|Decretal}}
The word is also used to denote certain specified collections of church law, e.g. [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s Decree (''[[Decretum Gratiani]]''). In respect of the general legislative acts of the pope there is never doubt as to the universal extent of the obligation; the same may be said of the decrees of a General Council, e.g. those of the [[First Vatican Council]]. 

The Council of Trent was the first to apply the term indiscriminately to rulings concerning faith and discipline (''decreta de fide, de reformatione'').

==Decrees of Roman curial congregations==
{{Roman Curia}}
{{main|Congregation (Roman Curia)}}
{{see also|1917 Code of Canon Law}}
The Roman Congregations were formerly empowered to issue decrees in matters which came under their particular jurisdiction. The decrees of the [[congregation (Roman Curia)|Roman Congregations]] (q. v.) are certainly binding in each case submitted for judgment. But there are varying opinions as to whether such judgment is to be taken as a rule or general law applying to all similar cases. The common opinion is that when the decisions are enlargements of the law (''declaratio extensiva legis'') the decisions do not bind except in the particular case for which the decree is made. If, however, the decision is not an enlargement, but merely an explanation of the law (''declaratio comprehensiva legis''), such decree binds in similar cases.
===Benedict XV's restriction of curial decrees===
[[File:Cover of a copy of the 1917 Codex Iuris Canonici (Code of Canon Law).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Hardcover of the ''1917 Code of Canon Law'']]
On 15 September 1917, by the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''Cum Iuris Canonici'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XV]], [[motu proprio]] ''Cum Iuris Canonici'' of 15 September 1917, ([[Edward N. Peters]], 1917 Code, pg. 25)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XV]] made provision for a Pontifical Commission charged with interpreting the code and making any necessary modifications as later legislation was issued. New laws would be appended to existing canons in new paragraphs or inserted between canons, repeating the number of the previous canon and adding ''bis'', ''ter'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XV]], [[motu proprio]] ''Cum Iuris Canonici'' of 15 September 1917, §III ([[Edward N. Peters]], 1917 Code, pg. 26)&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. "canon 1567''bis''" in the style of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]) so as not to subvert the ordering of the code, or the existing text of a canon would be completely supplanted. The numbering of the canons was not to be altered.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, ''What is Canon Law?'' pgs. 62-63&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Congregation (Roman Curia)|Roman Congregations]] were forbidden to issue new general decrees, unless it was necessary, and then only after consulting the Pontifical Commission charged with amending the code. The congregations were instead to issue Instructions on the canons of the code, and to make it clear that they were elucidating particular canons of the code.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XV]], [[motu proprio]] ''Cum Iuris Canonici'' of 15 September 1917, §§II-III ([[Edward N. Peters]], 1917 Code, pg. 26)&lt;/ref&gt; This was done so as not to make the code obsolete soon after it was promulgated. The 1917 Code was very rarely amended, and then only slightly.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, ''What is Canon Law?'' pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular law==
The decrees of a national council may not be promulgated until they have received the approval of the pope. The decrees of a provincial synod have no force until they have been approved by Rome. This approval is twofold: ordinary (''in formâ communi''), and specific (''in formâ specificâ''). The former means that there is nothing which needs correction in the decrees of the synod, and they thereby have force in the province. This is the approval generally given to such decrees. If approval is given in ''formâ specificâ'' the decrees have the same force as if they emanated from the Apostolic See, though they are binding only in the province for which they are made. 

The decrees of a diocesan bishop deal with the administration and good order of his diocese. If they are made during a synod, they are diocesan laws, are usually known as "diocesan statutes", or "synodal statutes", and bind until revoked by the bishop or his successor. If the decrees are extra-synodal, they have force only during the lifetime of the bishop or until he revokes them himself.

Since DNMS is [[modular]], it can be easily customized and extended.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} DNMS has been deployed to manage different types of networks and [[network element]]s whether it is [[wireless access point]]s, or [[optical switch]]es or [[core router]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Interfaces==
DNMS supports a variety of [[Northbound interface|northbound and southbound interfaces]].

Northbound interfaces are provided to pass information to other network management and [[service management systems]] using [[Java Management Extensions|JMX]], [[CORBA]], [[SNMP]] and [[XML]]/[[HTTP]] protocols.
 
Southbound interfaces provide two-way access to network elements using any proprietary protocols required by the customer as well as standard protocols, such as SNMP, [[TL1]], XML, [[Common management information protocol|CMIP]], CORBA and [[NetFlow]]/[[IPFIX]].

[[File:PExdcr01CJC.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A circuit built on a printed circuit board (PCB).]]

An '''electronic circuit''' is composed of individual [[electronic component]]s, such as [[resistor]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s and [[diode]]s, connected by conductive [[wire]]s or [[Conductive trace|traces]] through which [[electric current]] can flow. To be referred to as ''electronic'', rather than ''electrical'', generally at least one [[active component]] must be present. The combination of components and wires allows various simple and complex operations to be performed: signals can be amplified, computations can be performed, and data can be moved from one place to another.&lt;ref name="Alexander and Sadiku"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fundamentals of Electric Circuits|author=Charles Alexander and Matthew Sadiku|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Circuits can be constructed of discrete components connected by individual pieces of wire, but today it is much more common to create interconnections by photolithographic techniques on a laminated [[Substrate (semiconductor)|substrate]] (a [[printed circuit board]] or PCB) and [[solder]] the components to these interconnections to create a finished circuit. In an [[integrated circuit]] or IC, the components and interconnections are formed on the same substrate, typically a semiconductor such as [[silicon]] or (less commonly) [[gallium arsenide]].&lt;ref name="Jaeger"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Microelectronic Circuit Design|author=Richard Jaeger|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An electronic circuit can usually be categorized as an [[analog circuit]], a [[digital circuit]], or a mixed-signal circuit (a combination of analog circuits and digital circuits).

[[Breadboard]]s, [[perfboard]]s, and [[stripboard]]s are common for testing new designs. They allow the designer to make quick changes to the circuit during development.

==Analog circuits==
{{Main|Analog electronics}}
[[File:Common Base amplifier.png|right|thumb|A [[circuit diagram]] representing an analog circuit, in this case a simple amplifier]]  

[[analog electronics|Analog electronic circuits]] are those in which current or [[voltage]] may vary continuously with time to correspond to the information being represented. Analog circuitry is constructed from two fundamental building blocks: [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] and [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]] circuits.

In a series circuit, the same current passes through a series of components. A string of Christmas lights is a good example of a series circuit: if one goes out, they all do.

In a parallel circuit, all the components are connected to the same voltage, and the current divides between the various components according to their resistance.

[[File:Simple electrical schematic with Ohms law.png|right|thumb|width200| A simple schematic showing wires, a resistor, and a battery]]

The basic components of analog circuits are wires, resistors, capacitors, inductors, [[diode]]s, and [[transistor]]s. (In 2012 it was demonstrated that [[memristor]]s can be added to the list of available components.) Analog circuits are very commonly represented in [[schematic diagram]]s, in which wires are shown as lines, and each component has a unique symbol. Analog circuit analysis employs [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]]: all the currents at a node (a place where wires meet), and the voltage around a closed loop of wires is 0. Wires are usually treated as ideal zero-voltage interconnections; any resistance or reactance is captured by explicitly adding a parasitic element, such as a discrete resistor or inductor. Active components such as transistors are often treated as controlled current or voltage sources: for example, a [[field-effect transistor]] can be modeled as a current source from the source to the drain, with the current controlled by the gate-source voltage.

An alternative model is to take independent power sources and [[electromagnetic induction|induction]] as basic electronic units; this allows modeling frequency dependent [[Negative resistance|negative resistors]], [[gyrator]]s, [[negative impedance converter]]s, and [[dependent source]]s as secondary electronic components.{{clarify|date=April 2018}}{{cn|date=April 2018}}

When the circuit size is comparable to a wavelength of the relevant signal frequency, a more sophisticated approach must be used, the [[distributed element model]].  Wires are treated as transmission lines, with nominally constant [[characteristic impedance]], and the [[electrical impedance|impedances]] at the start and end determine transmitted and reflected waves on the line.  Circuits designed according to this approach are [[distributed element circuit]]s. Such considerations typically become important for circuit boards at frequencies above a GHz; integrated circuits are smaller and can be treated as lumped elements for frequencies less than 10GHz or so.

==Digital circuits==
{{Main|Digital electronics}}

In [[digital electronics|digital electronic circuits]], electric signals take on discrete values, to represent logical and numeric values.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Introduction to Digital Logic Design|author=John Hayes|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; These values represent the information that is being processed. In the vast majority of cases, binary encoding is used: one voltage (typically the more positive value) represents a binary '1' and another voltage (usually a value near the ground potential, 0 V) represents a binary '0'.  Digital circuits make extensive use of [[transistor]]s, interconnected to create [[logic gate]]s that provide the functions of [[Boolean logic]]: AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR and all possible combinations thereof.  Transistors interconnected so as to provide positive feedback are used as latches and flip flops, circuits that have two or more metastable states, and remain in one of these states until changed by an external input.  Digital circuits therefore can provide both logic and memory, enabling them to perform arbitrary computational functions.  (Memory based on [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]] is known as [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM).  Memory based on the storage of charge in a capacitor, [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) is also widely used.) 

The design process for digital circuits is fundamentally different from the process for analog circuits. Each logic gate regenerates the binary signal, so the designer need not account for distortion, gain control, offset voltages, and other concerns faced in an analog design.  As a consequence, extremely complex digital circuits, with billions of logic elements integrated on a single silicon chip, can be fabricated at low cost.  Such digital integrated circuits are ubiquitous in modern electronic devices, such as calculators, mobile phone handsets, and computers.  As digital circuits become more complex, issues of time delay, [[race condition|logic race]]s, power dissipation, non-ideal switching, on-chip and inter-chip loading, and leakage currents, become limitations to the density, speed and performance.  

Digital circuitry is used to create general purpose computing chips, such as [[microprocessor]]s, and custom-designed logic circuits, known as [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASICs). [[Field-programmable gate arrays]] (FPGAs), chips with logic circuitry whose configuration can be modified after fabrication, are also widely used in prototyping and development. &lt;!-- and to be done through it --&gt;

==Mixed-signal circuits==
{{main | Mixed-signal integrated circuit }}

Mixed-signal or hybrid circuits contain elements of both analog and digital circuits.  Examples include [[comparator]]s, [[timers]], [[phase-locked loop]]s, [[analog-to-digital converter]]s, and [[digital-to-analog converter]]s.  Most modern radio and communications circuitry uses mixed signal circuits.  For example, in a receiver,  analog circuitry is used to amplify and frequency-convert signals so that they reach a suitable state to be converted into digital values, after which further signal processing can be performed in the digital domain.

'''Ellen Henrietta Swallow Richards''' (December 3, 1842 &amp;ndash; March 30, 1911) was an [[Industrial engineering|industrial]] and [[Safety engineering|safety engineer]], [[environmental chemist]], and university faculty member in the United States during the 19th century. Her pioneering work in sanitary engineering, and experimental research in domestic science, laid a foundation for the new science of [[home economics]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2135&amp;ResourceType=Building |title=Richards, Ellen Swallow, Residence |date=April 7, 1991 |accessdate=2013-09-04 |quote= |publisher=[[National Historic Landmarks Program]] |location= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011063112/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2135&amp;ResourceType=Building |archivedate=October 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the founder of the home economics movement characterized by the application of science to the home, and the first to apply chemistry to the study of nutrition.&lt;ref name=mozans&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mozans|first1=H.

== Biography ==

=== Early childhood ===
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards 1848.jpg|thumb|upright|Daguerreotype of Ellen Henrietta Swallow, c. 1848]]
Richards was born in [[Dunstable, Massachusetts]]. She was the only child of Peter Swallow (b. June 27, 1813, Dunstable; d. March 1871, Littleton, Massachusetts) and Fanny Gould Taylor (b. April 9, 1817, [[New Ipswich, New Hampshire]]), both of whom came from established families of modest means and were believers in the value of education.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Early life and education ===
Swallow was home-schooled in her early years. In 1859 the family moved to Westford and she attended [[Westford Academy]].&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Caroline Louisa | title = The life of Ellen H. Richards | publisher = Whitcomb &amp; Barrows | edition = 1st | location = Boston | year = 1912 | isbn = | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofellenhrich00huntrich }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies at the academy included mathematics, composition, and Latin, similar to other New England academies of the time.  Swallow's Latin proficiency allowed her to study French and German, a rare language north of New York.&lt;ref name="JuneKennedy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kennedy | first = June W. | title = Westford Recollections of Days Gone By: Recorded Interviews 1974-1975 A Millennium Update | publisher = Author House | edition = 1st | location = Bloomington, IN | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-4259-2388-7 | lccn = 2006904814 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her language skills she was much in demand as a tutor, and the income earned doing this made it possible for Swallow to further her studies.

[[File:Old Westford Academy, MA.jpg|thumb|Old Westford Academy]]

In March 1862, she left the academy. Two months later, in May, she developed the [[measles]] which set her back physically and interrupted her preparations to begin teaching.

[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|upright|Miss Ellen Henrietta Swallow, c. 1864]]
In the spring of 1863 the family moved to Littleton, Massachusetts, where Mr. Swallow had just purchased a larger store and expanded his business. In June 1864, Swallow, now twenty-one, took a teaching position.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

She did not teach again in 1865 but spent that year tending the family store and taking care of her ill mother. During the winter of 1865–66, Swallow studied and attended lectures in Worcester.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== College education ===
In September 1868 she entered [[Vassar College]] classified as a special student.  Somewhat over a year later she was admitted to the senior class, graduating in 1870 with a bachelor's degree.  She then earned a Master of Art's degree with a thesis on the chemical analysis of iron ore. The strongest personal influences during her college years were [[Maria Mitchell]], the astronomer, and Professor Charles S. Farrar (1826-1908&lt;ref name="FarrarVassar"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/faculty/original-faculty/charles-farrar.html |title= Charles Farrar |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= Vassar Encyclopedia|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who was at the head of the Department of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;
{{multiple image|header= |direction=vertical|align=right|image1 = Ellen Swallow Richards Vassar 1870.jpg|caption1 = Miss Ellen Henrietta Swallow, Vassar Class Picture, 1870|image2 = EllenSwallowRichardsThesisSignature.svg|caption2 =Signature from 1873 MIT thesis}}
In 1870, she wrote to Merrick and Gray, commercial chemists in Boston, asking if they would take her on as an apprentice.  They replied that they were not in a position to take pupils, and that her best course was to try to enter the Institute of Technology of Boston as a student.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;
On December 10, 1870, after some discussion and a vote, the Faculty of the Institute of Technology recommend to the Corporation the admission of Miss Swallow as a special student in Chemistry.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt; Swallow thus became the first woman admitted to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where she was able to continue her studies, "it being understood that her admission did not establish a precedent for the general admission of females" according to the records of the meeting of the [[MIT Corporation]] on December 14, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-mit.html#corp Ellen Swallow Richards &amp; MIT: Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections: MIT]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1873, Swallow received a Bachelor of Science degree from MIT for her thesis, "Notes on Some Sulpharsenites and Sulphantimonites from Colorado".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-swallow.pdf Notes on Some Sulpharsenites and Sulphantimonites from Colorado]&lt;/ref&gt; She continued her studies at MIT and would have been awarded its first advanced degree, but MIT balked at granting this distinction to a woman and did not award its first advanced degree, a Master of Science in Chemistry, until 1886.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Richards served on the board of trustees of Vassar College for many years and was granted an honorary doctor of science degree in 1910.

=== Marriage and home ===
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards 1904.jpg|upright|thumb|Robert and Ellen Richards, 1904]]
On June 4, 1875, Miss Swallow married [[Robert Hallowell Richards|Robert H. Richards]] (1844-1945), chairman of the [[Mine Engineering]] Department at MIT, with whom she had worked in the mineralogy laboratory.  They took up residence in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. With her husband's support she remained associated with MIT, volunteering her services and contributing $1,000 annually to the "Woman's Laboratory," a program in which her students were mostly schoolteachers, whose training had lacked laboratory work, and who wanted to perform chemical experiments and learn mineralogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rossiter|first1=Margaret W.|title=Women Scientists in America|date=1982|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0801824435|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Her first post-college career was as an unpaid chemistry lecturer at MIT from 1873 to 1878.&lt;ref name=zierdt /&gt;

[[File:Lawrence Experiment Station - DSC03522.JPG|thumb|right|2011 addition to the [[Lawrence Experiment Station]]]]
From 1884 until her death, Swallow now Richards was an instructor at the newly founded laboratory of sanitary chemistry at the [[Lawrence Experiment Station]], the first in the United States, headed by her former professor [[William R. Nichols]].

In 1884 she was appointed as an instructor in sanitary chemistry at a newly formed MIT laboratory for the study of sanitation.&lt;ref name=ogilvie&gt;{{Cite book

    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Richards was a consulting chemist for the Massachusetts State Board of Health from 1872 to 1875, and the Commonwealth's official water analyst from 1887 until 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/women-scientists/ellen-h-swallow-richards.html|title=Ellen H. Swallow Richards (1842–1911) - American Chemical Society|website=American Chemical Society|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also served as nutrition expert for the US Department of Agriculture.

== Scientific experiments ==

=== Air and water quality ===

In the 1880s, her interests turned toward issues of sanitation, in particular air and water quality.&lt;ref name=zierdt /&gt; She performed a series of water tests on 40,000 samples of local waters which served as drinking water for their immediate populations.  These led to the so-called "Richards' Normal Chlorine Map" which was predictive of inland water pollution in the state of Massachusetts. This map plotted the chloride concentrations in waters of the state. It illustrated the natural distribution of chlorides from the ocean. (Her survey long preceded the practice of road de-icing with chlorine derivative salts.) Her map plotted greater than 6.5 parts per million (ppm) of chloride near the coast, with Cape Cod concentrations well in excess of 10 ppm and with a near-steady decreasing gradient to less than 1 ppm about the Berkshire Hills in the extreme western end of the state. Thereby waters with chloride concentrations that deviated from the plot could be suspected of human pollution. As a result, Massachusetts established the first water-quality standards in America, and the first modern [[sewage treatment plant]] was created.&lt;ref name=oakes /&gt;

=== Mineralogy ===
Richards' master's thesis at Vassar was an analysis of the amount of [[vanadium]] in iron ore.&lt;ref name=oakes&gt;{{Cite book

        |publication-date = 2002
        }}&lt;/ref&gt;
She performed numerous experiments in mineralogy, including the discovery of an insoluble residue of the rare mineral [[Samarskite-(Y)|samarskite]]. This was later determined by other scientists to yield [[samarium]] and [[gadolinium]]. In 1879 she was recognized by the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers as their first female member.&lt;ref name=zierdt&gt;{{Cite book

        }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home sanitation ===
Richards applied her scientific knowledge to the home. Since women were responsible for the home and family nutrition at the time, Richards felt that all women should be educated in the sciences. She wrote books about science for use in the home, such as ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning'', published in 1882.&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;{{Cite book

She used her own home as a kind of experimental laboratory for healthier living through science. Concerned with air quality in her home, she moved from coal heating and cooking oil to gas. She and her husband installed fans to pull air from the home to the outside to create a cleaner air environment within the home. She also determined the water quality of the property's well through chemical testing, and to insure that waste water was not contaminating the drinking water.&lt;ref name=clarke /&gt;

=== Euthenics ===

Richards derived the term [[euthenics]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb Eutheneo, Εὐθηνέω (eu, well; the, root of tithemi, to cause). To be in a flourishing state, to abound in, to prosper.—''[[Demosthenes]]''. To be strong or vigorous.—''[[Herodotus]]''. To be vigorous in body.—''[[Aristotle]]''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards"&gt;{{cite book | last = Richards | first = Ellen H. Swallow | title = Euthenics: The Science of Controllable Environment : A Plea for Better Conditions As a First Step Toward Higher Human Efficiency | publisher = Whitcomb &amp; Barrows | edition = 2nd | location = Boston | origyear = 1910 | year = 1912 | isbn = 0405098278 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  And from the Greek [[Euthenia]], Εὐθηνία. Good state of the body: prosperity, good fortune, abundance.—''Herodotus''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt; The opposite of Euthenia is [[Penia]] - Πενία ("deficiency" or "[[poverty]]") the personification of poverty and need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Penia.html Theoi Project - Penia]&lt;/ref&gt;

    }}&lt;/ref&gt; she defined the term as the betterment of living conditions, through conscious endeavor, for the purpose of securing efficient human beings.

Vigorous debate about its exact meaning, confusion with the term [[eugenics]], followed by the [[Great Depression]] and two world wars, were among the many factors which led to the movement never really getting the funding, nor the attention needed to put together a lasting, vastly multidisciplinary curriculum as defined by Richards. Instead, different disciplines such as Child Study became one such curriculum.

Martin Heggestad of the Mann Library notes that:&lt;blockquote&gt; Starting around 1920, however, home economists tended to move into other fields, such as nutrition and textiles, that offered more career opportunities, while health issues were dealt with more in the hard sciences and in the professions of nursing and public health. Also, improvements in public sanitation (for example, the wider availability of sewage systems and of food inspection) led to a decline in infectious diseases and thus a decreasing need for the largely household-based measures taught by home economists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/h/hearth/hygiene.html HEARTH Library-Cornell University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Richards was the first writer to use the term euthenics, in ''The Cost of Shelter'' (1905), with the meaning "the science of better living".&lt;ref name="JohnKGrandy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grandy | first = John K. | editor-last = Birx | editor-first = H.J. | title = Euthenics | series = Encyclopedia of Anthropology | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | volume = 5 Vols. | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781412952453 | doi = 10.4135/9781412952453 | url =http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/anthropology/n312.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laboratory work ===
After her first experience as water analyst under Professor Nichols, Richards began a large, private practice in sanitary chemistry, including testing water, air and food, and the testing wallpapers and fabrics for [[arsenic]]. In 1878 and 1879 she examined a large number of staple groceries for the state. The results of her investigation were published in the first annual report of the Board of Health, Lunacy and Charity, which had succeeded the earlier Board of Health.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

She also served as a consultant to the [[Zachariah Allen|Manufacturers Mutual Fire Insurance Company]] and in 1900 wrote the textbook ''Air, Water, and Food from a Sanitary Standpoint'', with A. G. Woodman. Her interest in the environment led her to introduce the word [[ecology]] into English around 1892. The word had been coined by German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] to describe the "household of nature".

Richards' interests also included applying scientific principles to domestic situations, such as [[nutrition]], [[clothing]], [[physical fitness]], [[sanitation]], and efficient home management, creating the field of [[home economics]]. "Perhaps the fact that I am not a radical and that I do not scorn womanly duties but claim it as a privilege to clean up and sort of supervise the room and sew things is winning me stronger allies than anything else," she wrote to her parents. She published ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning: A Manual for House-keepers'' in 1881, designed and demonstrated model kitchens, devised curricula, and organized conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-rumford.html Ellen Swallow Richards: Rumford Kitchen: Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections: MIT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's education ==

=== Woman's Laboratory assistant instructor ===
Mrs. Richards appeared before the [[American Association of University Women|Woman's Education Association]] of Boston on November 11, 1875, and in an address, which made a deep impression, set forth the needs of women. She expressed the belief that the governing board of the Institute of Technology would provide space for a woman's laboratory if the Association would supply the necessary money for instruments, apparatus, and books. She said that scholarships would be indispensable.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

The Woman's Education Association appointed a committee to enter into discussions with the Institute of Technology, which led to the creation of the MIT Woman's Laboratory in November 1876. The Institute provided a small building, planned for a gymnasium, as the location of the Laboratory.  Mrs. Richards became an unpaid assistant instructor in 1879 in [[chemical analysis]], [[industrial chemistry]], [[mineralogy]], and [[biology|applied biology]] under Professor John M. Ordway. The Woman's Education Association agreed to raise money to buy equipment for the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

A new building, erected by the Institute in 1883, reserved space for all laboratory students' use, women as well as men. The original Woman's Laboratory was closed and the building demolished.

In 1884, Mrs. Richards was appointed Instructor in Sanitary Chemistry in the Institute of Technology itself, a position which she filled until the time of her death. In addition to her faculty duties and instructional work, she was also the "untitled" Dean of Women.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== American correspondence school instructor ===
In January 1876, Mrs. Richards began a long association with the first American correspondence school, the [[Society to Encourage Studies at Home]], as an instructor, and developed its science department.&lt;ref name="Hunt"/&gt;

In 1886, a new section promoted by Richards, Sanitary Science, was established by the Society. This was at a time when household conveniences employing water, gas, or electricity were becoming more common, but housekeepers seldom understood the dangers or difficulties inherent in using these new appliances. She saw that instruction was needed and the Society began to provide information on how to organize a house on truly scientific principles.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== American Association of University Women ===

[[File:AAUW Headquarters by Matthew Bisanz.JPG|thumb|upright|Headquarters of the AAUW in Washington DC]]
Richards and [[Marion Talbot]] (Boston University class of 1880) became the "founding mothers" of what was to become the [[American Association of University Women]] (AAUW) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://history.aauw.org/|website=AAUW.org|publisher=AAUW|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they invited fifteen other women college graduates to a meeting at Talbot's home in Boston, on November 28, 1881. The group envisioned an organization in which women college graduates would band together to open the doors of higher education to other women and to find wider opportunities for their training. The Association of Collegiate Alumnae (ACA), AAUW's predecessor organization, was officially founded on January 14, 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association of Collegiate Alumnae Records|url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss323.html|publisher=Five College Archives &amp; Manuscript Collections|website=five colleges.edu|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teachers' School of Science ===
[[Lucretia Crocker]], along with women's clubs and other help in the Boston area, created a "[[Teachers' School of Science]]" in Back Bay at the New Museum of the Boston society.  Along with Mrs. Richards, Crocker created a mineralogy course for teachers.  Teacher found such education in the Boston area because of area scientist that would teach their courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kohlstedt, Sally Gregory. |title = Nature, Not Books: Scientists and the Origins of the Nature-Study Movement in the 1890s. Isis, Vol. 96, No. 3 |date = September 2005 |pages=324–352, p. 328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New England Kitchen of Boston ===
In January 1, 1890, Richards collaborated with [[Mary Abel|Mary Hinman Abel]] (1850–1938) to found the New England Kitchen of Boston, at 142 Pleasant Street.  Using volunteers of modest circumstances, they experimented with ways to prepare the most inexpensive, tasty and nutritious food.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Years later, Mrs. Richards, herself, wrote in her preface to part one of ''The Rumford kitchen leaflets: No. 17, The Story of the New England Kitchen; Part II; A study in social economics'', by Mary Abel:&lt;ref name="RumfordKitchen" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The story of the New England Kitchen ... is remarkable for two things: the new and valuable information which has been acquired, as the result of the daily work of the Kitchen, and the short time which has sufficed to put the enterprise on a business basis.

It is well to emphasize the causes of this success, that the lessons in social science and practical philanthropy be not lost. A large part of the credit is due ... to Mrs. Abel's hard work[.] [S]tarting the New England Kitchen ... was ... an experiment to determine the successful conditions of preparing, by scientific methods, from the cheaper food materials, nutritious and palatable dishes, which should find a ready demand at paying prices.

Mrs. Abel would doubtless give as the principal secret of her success, that she had everything necessary for the experiments, without giving a thought to the cost. ... In the New England Kitchen, the selection of the apparatus and material and the employment of labor have been without restriction. Without this freedom to carry on the experiments as seemed wise and prudent, the results detailed in the accompanying report could not have been attained.

The philanthropy of the scheme rests in the experimental stage of the development of the New England Kitchen. Whether the business can in the future take care of itself to the profit of those who conduct it remains to be seen ; but, in any event, kitchens of this kind cannot fail to be of great advantage to multitudes in moderate circumstances, who have hitherto been unable to buy good, nutritious, and tasteful cooked food.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Rumford Kitchen ===
[[File:CountRumfordFrontispiece.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Count Rumford]] frontispiece of the Rumford Kitchen leaflets]]
In 1893, when Richards was in charge of the Rumford Kitchen at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Fair in Chicago]], she accepted the added work and responsibility of arranging an exhibition of the work of Studies at Home.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

The opening statement of the ''Guide to the Rumford Kitchen: An Exhibit made by the State of Massachusetts in connection with the Bureau of Hygiene and Sanitation'' ([[World's Columbian Exposition]], Chicago, 1893) by General [[Francis Amasa Walker|Francis A. Walker]] explains:&lt;ref name="RumfordKitchen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Richards | first = Ellen H.  | title = Plain words about food: the Rumford kitchen leaflets, 1899. | publisher = Rockwell and Churchill Press | edition = 1st | location = Boston | year = 1899 | isbn = | lccn = | url = http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/2936825?n=1&amp;imagesize=1200&amp;jp2Res=.5&amp;printThumbnails=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The exhibit known as the Rumford Kitchen is the outgrowth of the work, in the application of the principles of chemistry to the science of cooking, which has for three years been carried on as an educational agency by Mrs. Robert H. Richards and Mrs. Dr. John J. Abel, with pecuniary assistance from certain public-spirited citizens of Boston.

The Massachusetts Board of World's Fair Managers, ... believing that such practical demonstration of the usefulness of domestic science could not fail to be of advantage to multitudes of visitors to the Columbian Exposition, have invited the ladies named to open the Rumford Kitchen as a part of the exhibit of Massachusetts in connection with the Bureau of Hygiene and Sanitation.

In order to reduce, in some degree, the expenses of this exhibit, the food cooked in the Rumford Kitchen will be sold under a concession from the administration of the Exposition ; but it should be understood that this is not a money-making exhibit ; that nothing is cooked for the sake of being sold ; and that the enterprise is to be regarded as absolutely a scientific and educational one.

The purpose of the exhibit in the Rumford Kitchen is two-fold : First, to commemorate the services to the cause of domestic science rendered by [[Count Rumford]] one hundred years ago[;] ... second, to serve as an incentive to further work in the same direction, as he expressed it," to provoke men to investigation," "to cause doubt, that first step toward knowledge."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first commercially available "modern" [[Rumford fireplace|kitchen ranges]] began to appear about 1800, they were the invention of an American named Sir Benjamin Thompson, [[Benjamin Thompson|Count von Rumford]].

=== American Public School Lunch Program ===
A first, major program was started in some Boston high schools in 1894 to provide nutritional meals at low prices to children who would not normally have them. Due in large part to Ellen Richards and [[Edward Atkinson (activist)|Edward Atkinson]], the New England Kitchen ran the program as a 'private enterprise' that paid for itself many times over. The lunches never became effective instruments for teaching the New Nutrition the founders had envisaged. But, because the program provided nutritious meals children would otherwise not have, it became the main justification for similar lunch programs in other cities."&lt;ref name="Levenstein"&gt;{{cite book | last = Levenstein | first = Harvey | title = Revolution at the Table: The Transformation of the American Diet | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | edition = | location = New York | year = 1988 | page = 116 | isbn =  | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed into law the [[National School Lunch Program]] to provide low-cost or free [[School meal|school lunch meals]] to qualified students through subsidies to schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/1946-national-school-lunch-act/ Copy of the School Lunch Act As Enacted in 1946], Federal Education Policy History website&lt;/ref&gt; The program was established as a way to prop up food prices by absorbing farm surpluses, while at the same time providing food to school age children. It was named after Richard Russell, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/Lunch/AboutLunch/ProgramHistory_4.htm The National School Lunch Program Background and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lake Placid Conference ===
Early in September, 1899, trustees of the [[Lake Placid Club]] (Morningside, New York) thought it was the right time to bring together those most interested in home science, or household economics and sent out many invitations for the Lake Placid Conference scheduled to take place Sept. 19-25, 1899. [[Melvil Dewey]], one of the club's trustees, personally invited Richards to attend.  She gave a lecture on standards of living and was elected chairman of the conference.&lt;ref name="LakePlacidConference"&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Richards | editor-first = Ellen H. | title = Lake Placid Conference proceedings | series = Lake Placid Conference | year = 1901–1908 | pages =  | place = Lake Placid, NY | publisher = American Home Economics Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Home Economics Association ===
In 1908, Richards was chosen as the first president of the newly formed American Home Economics Association, which was renamed the [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences]] in 1994. She also founded and funded the Association's periodical, the ''Journal of Home Economics'', which began publication in 1909. It was renamed the ''Journal of Family and Consumer Sciences'' in 1994 when the Association changed its name.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Her books and writings on this topic include ''Food Materials and their Adulterations'' (1886); ''Conservation by Sanitation''; ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning''; ''The Cost of Living'' (1899); ''Air, Water, and Food'' (1900); ''The Cost of Food''; ''The Cost of Shelter''; ''The Art of Right Living''; ''The Cost of Cleanness''; ''Sanitation in Daily Life'' (1907); and ''[[Euthenics]], the Science of Controllable Environment'' (1910). Some of these went through several editions.

== Death ==
Richards died on March 30, 1911 at her home in [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts]] after suffering with [[angina]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Mrs. Ellen H.

'''Gender mainstreaming''' is the [[public policy]] concept of assessing the different implications for people of different genders of any planned [[policy]] action, including [[legislation]] and [[Program (management)|programmes]], in all areas and levels. Mainstreaming essentially offers a pluralistic approach that values the diversity among people of different genders.

The concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. The idea has been pushed in the [[United Nations]] development community. The idea was formally featured in 1995 at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], and was cited in the document that resulted from the conference, the [[Beijing Platform for Action]].

== Definition ==
Most definitions of gender mainstreaming conform to the UN [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] formally defined concept:
: Mainstreaming a gender perspective is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. The ultimate goal is to achieve [[gender equality]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/52/plenary/a52-3.htm Report of the Economic and Social Council for 1997]". A/52/3.18 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are different approaches to gender mainstreaming:

''Institutional perspective:''  The ways in which specific organizations adopt and implement mainstreaming policies. This will often involve an analysis of how national politics intersects with international norms and practices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|last=Shepard|first=Laura J.|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Discursive'' ''perspective:'' Queries the ways in which mainstreaming reproduces power relations through language and issue-framing. This approach will often involve looking at documents, resolutions and peace agreements to see how they reproduce the narratives of gender in a political context.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

These approaches are not necessarily competing, and can be seen as complimentary.

The ways in which approaches are used, however, can also reflect differing feminist theories. For example, ''liberal feminism'' is strongly invoked by mainstreaming through the binary approach of gender in strict relation to the public sphere of policymaking. ''Poststructuralist feminism'' can be seen in mainstreaming thought which seeks to displace gender difference as the sole axis of difference and to highlight the diversity of policy its ramifications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Prioritizing gender equality===

Gender mainstreaming tries, among others, to ascertain a [[gender equality]] perspective across all [[policy]] areas.&lt;ref name="True, Jacqui 2010"&gt;True, Jacqui, Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 2010, 371&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacqui True, a Professor of politics and international relations, "[e]very [[policy]] or piece of [[legislation]] should be evaluated from the perspective of whether or not it reduces or increases gender inequalities."&lt;ref name="True, Jacqui 2010"/&gt; This concept of [[gender equality]] is not limited to formal equality, it includes as well equality de facto, which is a more holistic approach to gender [[policy]] in order to tackle the interconnected causes that create an unequal relation between the sexes in all areas of life (work, politics, sexuality, culture, and violence).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", Social Politics 12(3): 417&lt;/ref&gt;

Lombardo notes that "[t]here should be evidence that [[gender equality]] objective and policies of special concern for women (for example, [[social policy]]) have been prioritized in the organization among competing objectives (in terms of financial and human resources, type of measures adopted, voting systems used, and so forth)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Incorporating gender into politics and decision making===

Puechguirbal takes a discursive approach to argue that in order to successfully mainstream a gendered perspective in politics, language needs to be reevaluated and used to change the parameters of how women are perceived.

Historically, documents concerning international agreements, peacekeeping arrangements and legal resolutions have perpetuated stereotypes that disempower women. This can be seen through the use of language, even as simply as in the UN Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration program's (DDR) motto: 'One man, on weapon'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Reference of gender issues should be found in all [[policy]] areas. "There must be evidence that the [[mainstream]] political agenda has been reoriented by rethinking and rearticulating [[policy]] ends and means from a gender perspective," Lombardo says, referencing [[Rounaq Jahan]], a political scientists, feminist leader and author.&lt;ref name="Lombardo, E. 2005"&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", ''Social Politics'' 12(3): 417&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Beijing Platform for Action]] states, "women's equal participation in political life plays a pivotal role in the general process of the advancement of women."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Beijing Platform for Action, G. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, according to the [[Beijing Platform for Action]] "[w]ithout the active participation of women and the incorporation of women's perspective at all levels of decision-making, the goals of equality, development and peace cannot be achieved."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Therefore, Lombardo claims that women and men should be equally represented in any decision-making institution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Charlesworth agrees and believes that every effort should be made to broaden women's participation at all levels of decision-making.&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"&gt;Charlesworth, H., (2005) "Not waving but Drowning: Gender Mainstreaming and Human Rights in the United Nations", 18 ''Harvard Human Rights Journal'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-conflict peace-building (PCPB) ====
An area of policy and decision making that will particularly benefit from gender mainstreaming is post-conflict peace-building, also known as PCPB. Various feminist research has concluded that men and women experience violent conflict differently and moreover, the current policies surrounding PCPB are insufficient in addressing the disadvantaged position of women in male-dominated power structures that are further reinforced by peace-building efforts, both from the domestic and international communities. Gender mainstreaming in PCPB would emphasize the importance of gendered considerations of particular issues that disproportionally affect women in post-conflict settings. This would mean that policy reflected an acknowledgment of the many instances of wartime sexualized violence perpetrated on women, among other issues that (primarily) women face during conflict. A major focus of the effort towards gender mainstreaming in post-conflict peace-building policy is to lessen the international community's inclination towards building a return to 'normal' for the post-conflict region. Much of feminist research has found that returning to 'normal' is of little comfort for women, who were burdened by the patriarchal systems that were in place before conflict broke out. As Handrahan&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Handrahan|first=Lori|date=|title=Conflict, gender, ethnicity and post-conflict reconstruction|url=|journal=Security Dialogue|volume=35|pages=429–445|via=University of Victoria library database}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes, the international community involved in much of PCPB "tolerates high levels of violence against women in their own societies." Policy that prioritized gender in its applications and goals would seek to build a society where women are better off than they were before conflict broke out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Shifts in institutional culture===

Gender mainstreaming can be seen as a process of organizational change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bibbings|first=Sharleene May|title=The politics of mainstreaming in critical perspective|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Pub.|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=9781443835121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming must be institutionalized through concrete steps, mechanisms, and processes in all parts of the organization.&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt; According to Lombardo, this change involves three aspects: [[policy]] process, [[policy]] mechanisms; and [[policy]] actors. She explains as follows:

"1. A shift in [[policy]] process means that the process "is reorganized so that ordinary actors know how to incorporate a gender perspective" or that gender expertise is included "as normal requirement for [[policy]]-makers" (Council of Europe 1998, 165&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. 1998. Gender Mainstreaming: Conceptual Framework, Methodology and Presentation of Good Practices: Final Report of Activities of the Group of Specialists on Mainstreaming. EG-S-MS. Strasbourg: Council of Europe&lt;/ref&gt;).

2. A shift in [[policy]] mechanism involves (a) the adoption of horizontal cooperation on [[gender]] issues across all [[policy]] areas, levels, and departments; and (b) the use of appropriate [[policy]] tools and techniques to integrate the gender variable in all policies and to monitor and evaluate all policies from a [[gender]] perspective.

3. The range of [[policy]] actors participating in the policy-making process is broadened to include, apart from policy-makers and civil servants, gender experts and civil society."&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", Social Politics 12(3): 417-18&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender budgeting ==
{{Main|Gender budgeting}}

Gender budgeting encompasses activities and initiatives aiming at the preparation of [[budget]]s or the analysis of policies and budgets from a gender perspective. It can also be referred to as gender-sensitive budgeting or gender-responsive budgeting. Gender budgeting does not aim at creating separate budgets for women, or only increasing spending on women’s programmes. It is rather concerned with addressing budgetary [[gender inequality]] concerns, as for instance, how gender hierarchies influence budgets, and gender-based unpaid or low paid work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002316/231646e.pdf|title=A Guide for Gender Equality in Teacher Education Policy and Practices|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100069-0|location=|pages=72–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
As Jacqui True says, "[m]ainstreaming was established as a global strategy for achieving [[gender equality]], and in turn for achieving sustainable economic development in the 1995 [[Beijing Platform for Action]] ratified by all [[United Nations]] member states. It is now incumbent upon nation-states and international organizations to carry out gender mainstreaming. As such, mainstreaming has achieved widespread endorsement by individual governments, regional supra-state bodies."&lt;ref&gt;True, Jacqui, Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 2010, 369&lt;/ref&gt; What follows is a non-exhaustive list of examples of these endorsements.

===Nicaragua===
The election of 1990 in [[Nicaragua]] brought to office the first female [[president]] in the Americas. On April 25, 1990, [[Violeta Chamorro]] became the first and only woman to defeat a male incumbent presentment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prevost|first=G.|title='The Nicaraguan Revolution: Six Years After The Sandinista Electoral Defeat'|journal=Third World Quarterly|year=1996|volume=17|issue=2|pages=307–327|doi=10.1080/01436599650035707}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This helped to change and mobilize [[mainstream]] [[gender]] structure within [[Nicaragua]]. In 1993 the existing outdated Sandinista Women's organization, the Nicaraguan Institute for Research on Women, was revitalized and renamed by the Chamorro government as the Nicaraguan Institute for Woman (INIM). This was to encourage the involvement of Nicaraguan women in the country's economic, social, cultural, and political development and to promote a change in mainstream gender constructs.&lt;ref name="Isbester 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isbester|first=Katherine|title=Still Fighting: The Nicaraguan Women's movement, 1977-2000,|year=2001|publisher=University of Pittsburgh press|location=Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the INIM aims to institute in all sectors a system of gender-focus indicators and to achieve equal opportunity in all State body programming.&lt;ref name="General Assembly"&gt;{{cite web|last=General Assembly|first=United Nations|title=Nicaraguan Institute for women Instrumental in Mainstream Gender Equality Strategies, Anti-Discrimination,|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/wom1595.doc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the INIM with 62 women's groups held discussions to mobilize their initiatives and form a bill of action. The discussions formed a plan, which defined [[patriarchy]], [[sexism]], and [[gender stereotypes]] to reduce inequality in education, employment, and violence.&lt;ref name="Isbester 2001"/&gt;

Although the Nicaraguan Institute for Women claimed to "have been instrumental in mainstreaming [[gender equality]] principles and strategies into agriculture, socio-economic development, higher education, and sexual and [[domestic violence]] prevention," the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2007 raised several concerns, such as the backlog of important women's rights legislation in the country, the lack of studies on [[abortion]], and the available funds of the Institute.&lt;ref name="General Assembly"/&gt;

===Taiwan===
Under the influence of the UN community, the usage of the term increased in [[Taiwan]] since 2000. Local feminist organizations have different views on gender mainstreaming. Some groups considered that the Commission on Women Rights Promotion under [[Executive Yuan]] should be expanded, while other groups, including the [[National Alliance of Taiwan Women's Associations]], considered that gender mainstreaming is not promotion of women's rights but an assessment of all policies and requires a specific organization.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Fang-Mei. "性別主流化在台灣：從國際發展到在地化實踐". ''第一屆性別研究與公共政策學術研討會'', Taipei:[[Shih Hsin University]]. April 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foundation of Women's Rights Promotion and Development]] (FWRPD) has conducted research on gender mainstreaming and gender equality development, produced gender resources kits for training and education, networked women groups and entrepreneurs, participated in international exchange in [[UN]], [[APEC]] gender related meetings.&lt;ref name="website_apecwln.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apecwln.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/Taiwan%20Women's%20Organizations.pdf |title=Taiwan's Women's Organizations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=APEC Women Leaders Network |publisher=APEC Women Leaders Network. |access-date=2015-11-15 |quote= }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN Peacekeeping Operations===

The [[United Nations]] began acknowledging the importance of gender mainstreaming as a tool towards achieving [[gender equality]] in the mid-1990s, as outlined in the [[Beijing Platform for Action]] and the Report from the Secretary General to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United Nations, Fourth World Conference on Women|title=Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/pdf/BDPfA%20E.pdf|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=United Nations General Assembly |title=E/1997/66 |url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/1997/66 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001054742/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E%2F1997%2F66 |archivedate=2013-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2000, the [[UN Security Council]] passed Resolution 1325,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1325(2000)|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a resolution that called for an enhanced female participation in the prevention, management and resolution of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;True, Jacqui, Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 2010, 373&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peacekeeping]] was an area of particular concern, and the [[Security Council]] recognized "the urgent need to mainstream a gender perspective into [[peacekeeping]] operations."&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 1325, 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Council requested "the [[Secretary-General]], where appropriate, to include in his reporting to the [[Security Council]], progress on gender mainstreaming throughout peacekeeping missions and all other aspects relating to women and girls."&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 1325, 4&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there has been an increase in female peacekeeping personnel. As of 2012, in [[peacekeeping]] operations and special political missions, 29 percent of international and 17 percent of national staff were women. If we compare these figures with the 48 percent representation of women at the [[UN Headquarters]], the participation of women in the [[United Nations Peacekeeping]] operations still faces challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United Nations|title=Women in Peacekeeping|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/issues/women/womeninpk.shtml|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===

The equality [[policy]] of the [[European Union]] consists of three pillars: (1) [[anti-discrimination]], (2) [[affirmative action]] policies, and (3) gender mainstreaming.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, S., 2009, Assessing Advocacy: European Transnational Women's Networks and Gender Mainstreaming, 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Calvo, D.|year=2013|title=What is the problem of gender? Mainstreaming gender in migration and development policies in the European Union|location=Gothenburg|publisher=Department of Sociology and Work Science|type=Doctoral Dissertation|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/31823/1/gupea_2077_31823_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}

In the 1990s the [[European Union]] officially put gender mainstreaming on their agenda, "fixing the principle in [[treaty]] articles, action programs and communications, and setting up institutional bodies and mechanisms to promote the incorporation of a gender perspective into policymaking."&lt;ref&gt;Lang, S., 2009, Assessing Advocacy: European Transnational Women's Networks and Gender Mainstreaming, 2&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, gender mainstreaming was introduced in 1991 in the European Community as an element of the Third Action Programme on Equal Opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, Mark A. and Hafner-Burton, Emilie. 2000. Gender Mainstreaming in the European Union, Harvard Jean Monnet Working Paper 2/000, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the legal basis for gender mainstreaming in European law is Article 8 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (TFEU). This article states the following: "In all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women".

What follows is a non-exhaustive overview of current gender governance initiatives in the [[European Union]] that encourages gender mainstreaming.

For instance, since 1997 gender mainstreaming has been part of the [[European Employment Strategy]], a concept launched by the [[European Council]]. The [[European Employment Strategy]] requires governments to adopt an approach that complies with the concept of gender mainstreaming, while deciding on employment policies.&lt;ref name="Rubery, Jill 2005"&gt;Rubery, Jill, 2005, Reflections on Gender Mainstreaming: An Example of Feminist Economics in Action?, Feminist Economics 11(3), November 2005, 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Alison E. 2008. Too late for gender mainstreaming? Taking stock in Brussels Journal of European Social Policy (2008) 18 (3): 4&lt;/ref&gt; Some concrete examples: new equal opportunities acts requiring mainstreaming (e.g., in France social partners are required to promote gender equality through collective bargaining); mainstreaming or [[gender]] assessment in individual ministries or areas of public services (e.g., in Finland and Sweden); and [[gender]] assessment of all new pieces of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Rubery, Jill, 2005, Reflections on Gender Mainstreaming: An Example of Feminist Economics in Action?, Feminist Economics 11(3), November 2005, 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jill Rubery, a Professor of comparative employment system at Manchester School of Management, so far "the experience has been mixed: though the argument that increasing women's employment is critical to the achievement of Europe's aspirations for a higher employment rate has been widely accepted, there is a much weaker and more fragile commitment to improving the quality of work available to women."&lt;ref name="Rubery, Jill 2005"/&gt;

A second example is the Transnational Women's Networks.&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"&gt;Lang, S., 2009, Assessing Advocacy: European Transnational Women's Networks and Gender Mainstreaming, 12&lt;/ref&gt; As such we can cite the [[European Women's Lobby]] (EWL) as an important women's organization at EU level that was created in 1990. About 2,500 [[NGOs]] of 30 European countries are part of the EWL.&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|51}} The [[European Women's Lobby]] encourages "coordination of women's civic groups on the EU stages."&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt; The EWL lobbied for increasing the involvement of women's organizations in the process of gender governance.&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|51}} In addition the EWL has been pushing for "an EU Strategy to promote, implement and facilitate civil society and specifically women's organizations input into the European debate as an essential part of the European social model."&lt;ref&gt;European Women's Lobby. 2005a. Contribution from the European Women's Lobby to the Green Paper on an EU Approach to Managing Economic Migration, COM(2005)811 final, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Another important organization is [[Women in Development Europe]] (WIDE). This network, created in 1985, consists of NGOs, women's organizations, gender experts, and activists active in development. [[Women in Development Europe]] monitors European economic and developmental policies and practices&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|52}}  and is involved at many phases in policy-making activities as knowledge source.&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|52}}

Another [[gender]] governance actor is the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE), established in May 2007. The EIGE has as mandate to "provide expertise, improve knowledge and raise visibility of equality between men and women".&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|53}}

Obviously there are many more initiatives on EU level, to name a few: Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|57}} High Level Group on Gender Mainstreaming,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|58}} Inter-Service Group on Gender Equality,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt; Informal Group of Experts on Gender Equality in Development Cooperation,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|61}} Women in Europe for our Common Future.&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt;

==Criticism==

===Ineffective results===
Maria Stratigaki, Assistant Professor at the Department of Social Policy of [[Panteion University]], claims that the transformative effect of gender mainstreaming was minimal and its application has led to contradictory results. It opened important opportunities for specific policies in new [[policy]] areas, whereas in some other it diluted [[positive action]]. She also claims that, at least as of 2003, gender mainstreaming has failed to affect core [[policy]] areas or radically transform [[policy]] processes within the European Institutions.&lt;ref name="Stratigaki, M 2005"&gt;Stratigaki, M., (2005) "Gender Mainstreaming vs Positive Action. An Ongoing Conflict in EU Gender Equality Policy", ''European Journal of Women's Studies'' 12 (2): 165-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say that gender mainstreaming has not increased women's participation in decision making. As Charlesworth notes, "[i]n the most readily measurable area, the United Nations' employment of women in professional and managerial posts, progress has been glacial. In 2004, women held 37.4 percent of these positions. The annual growth rate toward the 50 percent target [...] is predicted to be 0.4 percent. On top of this slow growth, there is a considerable hierarchy based on sex. On June 30, 2004, women held 83.3 percent of positions at the lowest professional level, P-1, but just 16.7 percent at the highest staff level, Under-Secretary-General."&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt; In a similar vein, concerning the [[European Union]], Lombardo reports that as of 2003 women represented only 20 percent of the representatives of the head of state or government the member states, 10 percent of the representatives of national parliaments, 31.25 percent of the representatives of the [[European Parliament]] and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", Social Politics 12(3): 422&lt;/ref&gt;

True claims that mainstreaming gender does not end in simply increasing the number of women within a specific institution. It is about changing social consciousness, so that the effects of a policy for both women and men are truly analyzed before they are implemented. While it is necessary for [[feminists]] to engage with mainstream institutions, the ability of gender mainstreaming to deconstruct the embedded masculinization of institutions varies depending on the characteristics of the policy, the political nature of the institution, and the depth of the institution's consultation with civil society and other members of the women's rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;"True, J. (2010) "Mainstreaming Gender in International Relations". ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'' (New York: Routledge) L.J. Shepherd (Ed.) 194"&lt;/ref&gt; The danger of gender mainstreaming is that large compromises can be made for small gains and can lead to what feminist and sociology professor Carol Dines calls "trickle-down [[feminism]]"—i.e., "working to increase the ranks of women in elite jobs without a strategy for wider economic and social change represents a kind of "trickle-down [[feminism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/25/having-it-all-women-anne-marie-slaughter |title='Having it all' looks very different for women stuck in low-paid jobs &amp;#124; Gail Dines &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor implementation===
Charlesworth remarks that "[a]lthough it has not been difficult to encourage the adoption of the vocabulary of mainstreaming, there is little evidence of monitoring or follow-up. A consistent problem for all the organizations that adopted gender mainstreaming is the translation of the commitment into action."&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt; She continues: "A review of gender mainstreaming policies implemented under the [[United Nations Development Programme]], [[World Bank]], and [[ILO]] found inadequate budgeting for the gender components of projects, insufficient development of analytical skills, poor supervision of the implementation of gender components and a general lack of political commitment both within the organization and at the country level."&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt;

===Hindering progress===
Stratigaki claims that [[positive action]] was sidelined after the launch of gender mainstreaming as a result of the specific way gender mainstreaming was used by the opponents of [[gender equality]]. According to Stratigaki, "[a]lmost all analyses of [gender mainstreaming] agree that it is a strategy which complements but does not replace previous gender specific equality policies like equal treatment legislation and positive action." However, she states too that "in a hostile gender equality policy environments (i.e. patriarchal structures of institutional organisations or the prevalence of policy objectives contrary to gender equality etc.), [gender mainstreaming] may be conceived and applied as an alternative to positive action and used to downplay the final overall objective of [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="Stratigaki, M 2005"/&gt;

True is of the opinion that in practice, attempts to mainstream gender within international institutions have led to the marginalization and increasing invisibility of gender in each policy area. Anne-Marie Goetz, a Clinical Professor at [[NYU]], and Joanne Sandler, a consultant for gender equality and organizational development, argue that ironically, mainstreaming gender runs the risk of becoming everyone's responsibility, yet nobody's at the same time.&lt;ref name="True, J., 2010, p. 196"&gt;True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. ''Gender Mainstreaming in International Institutions''. New York: Routledge. p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming can allow those in power who are not genuinely interested in the women's movement to adopt the language of women's rights, a reflection of power politics that becomes more of a tool used to legitimize the actions of governments. Gender mainstreaming then becomes more about advising governments than advancing gender equality.&lt;ref name="True, J., 2010, p. 198"&gt;True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. ''Mainstreaming Gender in International Institutions''. New York: Routledge. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticism===

As differences are silenced, the kind of [[feminism]] that is likely to be mainstreamed could be a western, white, or middle class brand of feminism. When mainstreaming decisions within international organizations are made by elites can undermine the input of local women's groups.&lt;ref name=Palmary&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Palmary, I.|author2=Nunez, L.|year=2009|title=The Orthodoxy of Gender Mainstreaming: Reflecting on Gender Mainstreaming as Strategy for Accomplishing the Millennium Development Goals|journal=Journal of Health Management|volume=11|issue=65|pages=65–78|doi=10.1177/097206340901100105}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}}

When gender mainstreaming policies are drafted without consulting sections of the women's movement (i.e., women's rights civil society groups), they lack ground level-expertise. [[Policy]] decisions related to gender that are made without consulting sections of the women's movement do not demonstrate a clear political willingness to addressing gender inequality. When institutions reach out to the women's rights movement, it demonstrates transparency, inclusiveness, accountability and the implementation process is more likely to be monitored with diligence.&lt;ref name="True, J., 2010, p. 199"&gt;True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. Mainstreaming Gender in International Institutions. New York: Routledge. p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), as an attempt at mainstreaming gender into development, were formed with minimal consultation with women's groups. The MDGs have led to a considerable amount of theoretically discourse about the goals but less analysis about how they will be implemented.&lt;ref name=Palmary/&gt;{{rp|78}}

True highlights the tendency for gender mainstreaming to become a guise under which women are used as economic subjects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women are framed in terms of advancing economic growth, as opposed to the inherent normative ideal for women and men to hold equal positions of power in society.

The '''intercarrier method''' is a system in television that reduces the cost of transmitters and receiver sets by processing audio and video signals together and minimizing the number of separate stages for audio and video signals.

== Transmission of audio and video signals ==
In [[Television program|television]], unlike monophonic radio, at least two signals should be transmitted; [[audio signal|audio]] (AF) and [[video signal|video]] (VF) signals.

Transmitting those signals by means of separate [[transmitters]] and [[Antenna (radio)|antenna systems]] is a very costly solution. Because every stage must be used twice, one for AF and one for VF. Two separate transmitters, a high power combiner and a common antenna system, known as [[split sound system]], is also quite costly. But if the signals are combined at an earlier stage, number of costly outer stages is reduced.

The same logic also applies to [[television receiver|receiver]] sets. If the modulated signal is separated just before the [[Cathode ray tube|picture tube]] the number of separate stages for AF and VF is minimum.

This common signal processing system is known as intercarrier system.

== Intercarrier as used in TV transmitters ==
{{main|Television transmitter}}

In TV transmitters, both AF and VF [[modulation|modulate]] [[intermediate frequency]] (IF) carriers. (The frequency difference between the two carriers is 4.5&amp;nbsp;MHz in [[CCIR System M|System M]] and 5.5&amp;nbsp;MHz in [[CCIR System B|System B/G]]) Then the modulated IF signals are added either at the output of the [[Modulator|vision modulator]] or at the output of the vestigial sideband stage. In both cases, the added signals are low level signals and no special combining circuitry is required.

[[Frequency mixer|Frequency conversion]] and [[Amplifier|amplification]] is common. So a [[Electronic mixer|frequency converter]] (or a mixer) and a series of amplifiers for aural signal as well as an output [[combiner]] are spared, which reduce the cost of the transmitter and electricity consumption of the amplifiers considerably. Although a [[Band-stop filter|notch filter]] to suppress the intermodulation products  is used at the output of the intercarrier transmitter, the cost of the notch filter is not comparable to the cost of extra amplifiers and the output combiner. (See the subsection '''Intermodulation products''' below)

== Intercarrier as used in receiver sets ==

{{main|Television set}}

In TV receivers, the received radio frequency signal is converted to IF in tuner and then demodulated. The output of the demodulator consists of  a VF and an aural signal which is in fact an FM subcarrier modulated by AF. (The subcarrier is 5.5&amp;nbsp;MHz in system B and 4.5&amp;nbsp;MHz in system M ) The aural signal and the VF are separated by a simple filter.  The only extra stage needed for AF  (other than the [[loudspeaker]]) is an [[Demodulation|FM demodulator]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Grob,Charles E.Herndon:''Basic Television and Video Systems'', Glencoe, McGraw Hill, New York, 6th ed, 1999, p 469.&lt;/ref&gt;  The intercarrier receiver system makes for easier tuning of a TV station.  The viewer could fine tune such a set to get the best picture reception, and not lose sound reception. (Although AF VF signals are combined in the IF stages of the transmitters, they are separated in baseband stages of the receivers.)

== Intermodulation products and notch filters==
{{main|Intermodulation}}

When VF and the aural signal  modulate the same carrier the  inevitable non-linearity of the electronic circuits cause unwanted signals which are called intermodulation products. The unwanted signals appear on [[RF spectrum]] at regular intervals, the interval being equal to the frequency difference of the visual and aural carriers.

In TV broadcasting the intermodulation products of the aural subcarrier and the main carrier appear out of the  [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|RF band]] of the [[TV channel]]. However, out of band product means an unwanted transmission in the neighbour TV channels. For example, intermodulation products of channel 7 appear in channel 5,6, 8 and 9. That is why notch filters are used in intercarrier system.

==Early life and education==
Jamshed Bharucha was born in [[Mumbai|Mumbai, India]]. His father Jal Bharucha,&lt;ref name = Jal/&gt; a [[Parsi]] engineer from Mumbai, and mother Elizabeth Bharucha&lt;ref name = Elizabeth/&gt; (born Elizabeth Emily Robinson) a musician from Albany, New York, met at the [[University of Michigan]]. Jal Bharucha was the first engineer in India to employ computers in structural design, using an early facility at the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] in the 1960s. Elizabeth Bharucha was organist and choral director at the Scots Kirk (Church of Saints Andrew &amp; Columba) and the All Saints Church&lt;ref name="All Saints"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdtapvtltd.org/allsaints.htm |title=All Saints Church, Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Mumbai. Jal and Elizabeth were founding members of the Bombay International School,&lt;ref name="BIS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bisschool.com/ |title=Bombay International School}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which Jamshed graduated.

Bharucha graduated from [[Vassar College]] where he majored in [[biological psychology|biopsychology]] (1978), then received an M.A. in philosophy from [[Yale University]] (1979) and a Ph.D. in [[cognitive psychology]] from [[Harvard University]] (1983). He spent the 1982-83 academic year at [[Cornell University]]. At Harvard he worked with [[Stephen Kosslyn]], [[William Kaye Estes|William K. Estes]] and [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]].

Bharucha studied violin in Mumbai, received an Associate’s Diploma in violin performance from [[Trinity College of Music]] (London) in 1973 and then studied violin at [[Vassar College|Vassar]]. He was a member of the Bombay Chamber Orchestra;&lt;ref name="BCO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcoindia.co.in/ |title=Bombay Chamber Orchestra}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Vassar College Orchestra under the direction of [[Luis Garcia-Renart]]; the [[Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra]] performing at [[Sanders Theatre]] under the direction of [[James Yannatos]]; and the [[Bach Society Orchestra of Harvard University]].

==Academic and administrative career==

===Dartmouth College===
Bharucha spent most of his academic career at [[Dartmouth College]], where he was the John Wentworth Professor and rose from Associate Dean for the Social Sciences to Deputy Provost to Dean of the Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences.&lt;ref name="DoF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean goals" /&gt; He was the first [[Indian American]] to be named dean of a school at an [[Ivy League]] institution. While in the Dartmouth administration, he established the Dartmouth Brain Imaging Center&lt;ref name="MRI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dbic.dartmouth.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page |title=Dartmouth Brain Imaging Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the first teaching and research MRI facility outside a medical school, accessible to undergraduates, graduate students and faculty. His principal faculty appointment was in the Department of Psychological &amp; Brain Sciences, but he also taught in the Program in Linguistics &amp; Cognitive Science and the Program in [[electroacoustic music|Electroacoustic Music]] (now called Digital Musics).

As an academic administrator, he launched initiatives on teaching and research, as well as their integration in the form of active learning, encouraging undergraduates to get involved in research with their professors.&lt;ref name="UG research"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedartmouth.com/2002/02/01/opinion/creating/print |title=Dean's initiatives in undergraduate opportunities for active learning at Dartmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UG research press"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedartmouth.com/2002/02/01/news/offers |title=Active learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending 2015-2016 at [[Harvard]], Bharucha was appointed Distinguished Fellow at Dartmouth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Asch|first1=Joseph|title=Jamshed Bharucha is back|url=http://www.dartblog.com/data/2016/08/012778.php|website=Dartmouth's Daily Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he teaches in two departments: Education and Psychological &amp; Brain Science.&lt;ref name="BharuchaDartmouth" /&gt;

===Tufts University===
Bharucha moved from Dartmouth to [[Tufts]] in 2002 to assume the position of Provost &amp; Senior Vice President. He was recruited to Tufts by President [[Lawrence S. Bacow]], who later was appointed President of [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/02/12/tufts-bacow-was-tasked-with-reenergizing-university/gnuNvLxOJs95CHVOLEIZ2O/story.html|title=At Tufts, Lawrence Bacow was tasked with reenergizing the university|last=Fernandes|first=Deirdre|date=February 13, 2018|work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Provost, Bharucha was the chief academic officer of the university, overseeing the seven schools, the [[Tisch College]], the Institute for Global Leadership, the Fares Center and the Clinical &amp; Translational Research Institute.

Bharucha recruited to Tufts [[Vali Nasr]], [[Nalini Ambady]], [[Ray Jackendoff]], Gina Kuperberg, Mathias Scheutz and Peniel Joseph. During his tenure, the volume of sponsored research doubled, the average number of patents per year from research doubled, and revenues from technology transfer and industrial collaboration increased tenfold.&lt;ref name="NYT2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/07/nyregion/07cooper.html|title=At Tufts, Lawrence Bacow was tasked with reenergizing the university|last=Fernandes|first=Deirdre|date=February 13, 2018|work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bharucha launched the Summer Scholars program,&lt;ref name="Summer Scholars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uss.tufts.edu/undergradEducation/research/summer_scholars/index.asp |title=Summer Scholars Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides opportunities for undergraduate students to work on collaborative research with faculty across the university and its affiliated hospitals. He also launched the University Seminar,&lt;ref name="University Seminar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://provost.tufts.edu/1172048132183/Provost-Page-prov2w_1174562916192.html |title=University Seminar at Tufts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117144251/http://provost.tufts.edu/1172048132183/Provost-Page-prov2w_1174562916192.html |archivedate=2011-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a cross-disciplinary course, open to undergraduate, graduate and professional students.

Additions to the campus during his tenure include the Granoff Music Center&lt;ref name="Granoff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://as.tufts.edu/music/musiccenter/default.aspx |title=Granoff Music Center at Tufts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rebuilt Neuroscience Department&lt;ref name="Neuro Dept"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neurosci.tufts.edu/index.html |title=Neuroscience Department, Tufts Medical School}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Tufts School of Medicine.

===Cooper Union===

[[File:Le Ménestrel 1st Edition - 1 December 1833.jpg|thumb|242 px|Front page of the first edition of ''Le Ménestrel'' (1 December 1833)]]
'''''Le Ménestrel''''' (The Minstrel) was an influential French music journal published weekly from 1833 until 1940. It was founded by Joseph-Hippolyte l'Henry and originally printed by Poussièlgue. In 1840 it was acquired by the music publishers [[Éditions Alphonse Leduc#Heugel|Heugel]] and remained with the company until the journal's demise at the beginning of World War II. With the closure of its chief rival, ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris|La Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]'' in 1880, ''Le Ménestrel'' became France's most prestigious and longest-running music journal.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) pp. 2 and 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
In 1827 [[François-Joseph Fétis]] had founded ''La Revue Musicale'', France's first periodical devoted entirely to classical music. By 1834 it had two serious competitors, ''Le Ménestrel'' established in 1833 and [[Maurice Schlesinger]]'s ''Gazette Musicale'' established in 1834. ''Le Ménestrel'' was founded by the Paris publisher Joseph-Hippolyte l'Henry, with the first edition (printed by Poussièlgue) appearing on 1 December 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Gautier (1995) p. 156; ''Le Ménestrel'' (1 December 1833)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1835, Schlesinger bought ''La Revue Musicale'' from Fétis and merged the two journals into ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris|La Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]''. Until ''La Revue et Gazette'' ceased publication in 1880, ''Le Ménestrel'' was to be its main rival in terms of influence and breadth of coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

E. D'Arlhac took over the directorship of ''Le Ménestrel'' in July 1835, but relinquished it the following March to the journalist and critic [[Jules Lovy]], who had been a writer for the journal since its foundation. By 1836 ''Le Ménestrel'' had a weekly print run of 600 copies, although as [[Katharine Ellis]] points out, the number of actual readers was probably much larger. At the time, Paris alone had over 500 ''[[cabinet de lecture|cabinets de lecture]]'', private reading rooms and precursors to the modern library popular in early 19th century France where for a small fee the public could read the latest issues of newspapers and journals.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) pp. 1-2 and 268-269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. Books: A Living History. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum, 2011. p.105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, Harry Earl. The "Cabinet de Lecture" in France, 1800-1850. The Library Quarterly, 48(1). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, the newly formed music publishing partnership of [[Jacques-Léopold Heugel]] and [[Jean-Antoine Meissonnier]] acquired ''Le Ménestrel''. Heugel became the director, and Jules Lovy stayed on as editor-in-chief until his death in 1863. Lovy was succeeded by the critic and music historian [[Joseph d'Ortigue]]. Later editors-in-chief included [[Arthur Pougin]] who served from 1885 to 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; However, after d'Ortigue's death in 1866, only the Heugel name appeared on the [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]]. When Jacques-Léopold died in 1883, his son Henri-Georges Heugel took over as director. He was in turn succeeded by his own son Jacques-Paul who served as the director for the remainder of the journal's existence.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Ménestrel'' (3 February 1933) p. 52; Feurzeig (1994) p. 126; Nichols and Drake (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Le Ménestrel'' was published weekly for a period spanning 107 years, initially coming out on Sunday (later changed to Saturday and then Friday). The [[Franco-Prussian War]] caused publication to be suspended from late December 1870 through November 1871, and publication was suspended again for the duration of [[World War I]], with the first post-war issue appearing on 17 October 1919. At the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the journal carried on until the invasion of France. The 24 May 1940 issue announced that following the German attacks and the closure of theatres and concert halls in Europe and France as well as the [[Paris Conservatory]], the journal was suspending publication with the hope of resuming in the autumn.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Ménestrel'' (24 May 1940). Original text: "Nous souhaitons pouvoir reprendre, à l'automne, l'effort que nous nous sommes imposé pendant la première phase de la guerre, conscients d'avoir ainsi servi modestement, mais de notre mieux, la cause impérissable de la pensée et de l'art français."&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, it proved to be the last issue of ''Le Ménestrel''. The Heugel company continued to operate as an independent music publisher until 1980 when it was sold to [[Éditions Alphonse Leduc]].

Notable people who wrote for the journal include [[Henri Duponchel]], [[Max d'Ollone]], [[Alphonse Royer]] and [[Paul Collin]].

Magnetically controlled shunt reactor (MCSR, CSR) represents electrotechnical equipment purposed for compensation of [[reactive power]] and stabilization of voltage level in high voltage (HV) electric networks rated for voltage classes 36 – 750 kV. MCSR is shunt-type static device with smooth regulation by means of [[inductive reactance]].

==Purpose==
Magnetically controlled shunt reactors are intended for automatic control over [[reactive power]] and stabilization of voltage levels; these ensure the following: 

[[File:УШР 25 МВАр 110кВ.JPG|thumb|right|Magnetically controlled shunt reactor 25 MVAr 110 kV]]

* Elimination of daily and seasonal voltage variations in the power network;&lt;ref name="Russia Grids builds new power lines between Krasnoyarsk Krai and Irkutsk Oblast"&gt;[http://www.rosseti.ru/eng/press/news/?ELEMENT_ID=17459 Russia Grids builds new power lines between Krasnoyarsk Krai and Irkutsk Oblast]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Improvement of electric power quality;
* Optimization and automation of power network operating modes;
* Reduction of electric power losses within its [[electric power transmission|transmission]] and [[electric power distribution|distribution]];
* Improvement of power system stability;
* Enhancement of the conditions of operation in tens of times and prolongation of service life of the electric equipment by virtue of dynamic shortcut of switchings of uncontrolled devices for reactive power compensation as well as limitation of operation of less reliable devices – OLTC, [[transformer]]s and autotransformers
* Increasing of transmission line throughput performance and provision of reliable automatic control over voltage levels at power overflows close to limit values as referred to static stability;
* Avoiding of voltage collapse effect at emergency situations in the power network (for example, emergency trip of load, generator, transmission line, etc.;
* Assurance of operating conditions for power plant generators in such reaction power generation range which assist to the most favorable operating modes.

==Field of application==
On the assumption of tasks to be solved by MCSRs, as well as with consideration of existing experience of their operation, application field of controlled reactors covers (but not limited) the following areas of the power networks:
* networks with abrupt-changed load curves ;
* networks with worn-out switching and transformer equipment been used frequently for regulation of voltage levels;
* networks made using long-length transits, which tend to frequent variation of power flows’ value and/or direction;
* networks for power supply of the consumers with enhanced demand of voltage stability;
* networks with increased losses;
* networks having operating mode, which does not allow to provide permissible load of the generators as referred to reactive power.

Ample opportunities of MCSRs ensure expediency of their application for different voltage classes. Furthermore, expected effect could be shown up both at the level of local area consumer’s grids, and at solving the primary tasks of the national power system as a whole.

In the context of building-up of the market relations in the electric energy sector and increase of investments for development of power networks, MCSRs offer the complete series of considerable benefits for all economic entities:
* at the level of feeding and distribution electric networks, MCSRs ensure significant reduction of electric power losses and increase of profits of system operator and distribution companies, respectively;
* as referred to electric power consumers, MCSRs are installed for the purpose of reduction of the charges to be paid for consumed reactive power (maintaining of cos (ɸ)), ensuring the required voltage quality at the point of final customers, as well as in the capacity of required measures for connection of new capacities to the network.

==Operating principle==
Magnetically controlled shunt reactor is the transformer-type device which additionally provides functions of semiconducting key apparatus; this is ensured by means of reactor magnetic system operation in the domain of deep saturation. The basing principle allowed optimal employment of existing designs both in transformer production industry, and in the field of power electronics.Magnetic system of MCSR single phase includes two cores with windings, vertical and horizontal yokes. Control windings with opposite connection and power windings with series (accordant) connection are arranged on CST magnetic system cores. MCSR magnetic system cores are free from nonmagnetic gaps, and owing to this effect in case of the reactor connection to the network it will be in no-load condition. Herewith, the value of [[reactive power]] consumed from the grid will not exceed 3% of nominal magnitude. To increase reactor load as for reactive power, its operating range should be offset to non-linear area of hysteresis characteristic; and this is achieved for the account of additional biasing of magnetic system. At connection of regulated dc voltage source to the control windings, increase of the bias flux is ensured.[[File:УШР2.jpg|thumb|right|Simplified MCSR connection diagram]]

Due to the fact that ac flow of power winding is superimposed on the bias flux, the net flux is offset to the saturation domain of magnetic system cores. Respectively, saturation of the cores is resulted in occurrence of current in the power winding.  In case of energy input to or output from the control circuit, the transient process of increase or decrease of network current and, respectively, of reactive power consumed by reactor is ensured.

[[File:УШР1.png|thumb|left|MCSR processes during power increase/relief]]Reactor power winding current is regulated according to proportional control mode, when control angle of rectified current source thyristors is changed according to proportional mode depending on mismatching between the prescribed voltage setting and the voltage at the point of reactor connection. In case of necessity to implement the rapid transfer of the reactor from one quasi-steady-state mode to another one, the scheme of overexcitation/underexcitation is realized. In such case, time to gain full power starting from no-load condition is reduced up to 0,3 s. Constructively, it is possible to ensure every speed of the reactor power variation. However, based on practical experience of MCSR application, the optimal balance between the reactor operating speed and capacity of biasing system has been determined: speed of power increase/relief within 0,3 – 1,0 s, capacity of biasing system – 1 – 2% of the reactor rated capacity. [[File:MCSR.jpg|thumb|left|Saturation of electrical steel]] Depending upon desired requirements, MCSR is adjusted in such a way that would be possible to realize either voltage level stabilization, or consumed reactive power value, or consumed current magnitude. Controlled reactors, same as their non-controlled analogues, are subdivided into bus reactors and line reactors. Based on this principle, MCSR design would be completed with additional element which ensures pre-biasing of electromagnetic part and subsequent inertialess energizing of the reactor (with power increase time less than one cycle of power frequency). Similar to all transformer equipment, MCSR is able to withstand long-term overload up to 120 – 130% as well as should-term overload up to 200%. Moreover, considering the additional measures and the control algorithms, MCSR realizes all functions of uncontrolled shunt reactor including ability to operate within the interval of single-phase automatic reclosing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="73495">The '''Master of [[Business Administration]]''' ('''MBA''' or '''M.B.A.''') degree originated in the United States in the early 20th century when the country industrialized and companies sought [[scientific management|scientific approaches to management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: A school is “a building that has four walls…with tomorrow inside”: Toward the reinvention of the business school | doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.03.010 | journal=Business Horizons}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of business such as [[accounting]], [[applied statistics]], [[business communication]], [[business ethics]], [[business law]], [[finance]], [[managerial economics]], [[management]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[marketing]] and [[operations management|operations]] in a manner most relevant to management [[analysis]] and strategy.

Most programs also include [[elective course]]s and concentrations for further study in a particular area, for example accounting, finance, and marketing. MBA programs in the United States typically require completing about sixty [[Course credit|credits]], nearly twice the number of credits typically required for degrees that cover some of the same material such as the [[Master of Economics]], [[Master of Finance]], [[Master of Accountancy]], [[Master of Science in Marketing]] and [[Master of Science in Management]].

The MBA is a [[terminal degree]] and a [[Professional school|professional degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petersons.com/graduate-schools/getting-your-masters-degree.aspx |title=Getting Your Master's Degree |publisher=Peterson's |date=6 December 2013 |accessdate=6 October 2014 | quote=A master's degree comes in only two options: a professional, or "terminal" master's degree, or an academic master's degree...A terminal degree is a means to an end; it will prepare you for entrance into a specific type or group of jobs. A terminal degree implies there is no need for any further education, thus the word "terminal." Degrees from professional master's programs are usually marked by specific initials that denote their area of specialty, such as a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A) or Master of Library Science (M.L.S.) degree...Conversely, an academic degree centers on research and scholarly studies in a specific area. These degrees are more likely to lead to continued education at the doctoral level where you can specialize in a very specific area of that field...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Maier| first = Christopher| title = Complete Book of Graduate Programs in the Arts and Sciences| publisher = Random House| location = New York| date = 2005| page = 4| isbn = 0-375-76432-1|quote="PhD" and "terminal degree" are not synonymous.  A number of master's degrees lead students directly to, well, the end of the formal educational line.  One such example is the MFA, which is earned by practicing artists in fields such as creative writing, visual arts, and theater.  In the world of business administration degrees, an MBA is terminal.  Although a little research might turn up a handful of PhD options in the creative arts or business, these are different monsters; they don't take away from the fact the person with the MFA or the MBA has a terminal degree.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[School accreditation|Accreditation]] bodies specifically for MBA programs ensure consistency and quality of education. Business schools in many countries offer programs tailored to full-time, part-time, [[corporate title|executive]] (abridged coursework typically occurring on nights or weekends) and [[distance learning]] students, many with specialized concentrations.

==History==
The first school of business in the [[United States]] was [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|The Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] established in 1881 through a donation from [[Joseph Wharton]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt;. In 1900, the [[Tuck School of Business]] was founded at [[Dartmouth College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/about/history/|title=Tuck School of Business History|work=Tuck.dartmouth.edu|accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; conferring the first [[advanced degree]] in business, specifically, a Master of Science in Commerce, the predecessor to the MBA.&lt;ref name="Stabile2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Stabile|title=Economics, Competition and Academia: An Intellectual History of Sophism Versus Virtue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQNI7BUvYs4C&amp;pg=PA101|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84720-716-6|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration]] established the first MBA program in 1908, with 15 faculty members, 33 regular students and 47 special students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaplan | first1 = Andreas | year = 2014 | title = European management and European business schools: Insights from the history of business schools | url = | journal = European Management Journal | volume =  32| issue = | pages =  529–534| doi = 10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/about/history.html|title=History – About Us – Harvard Business School|work=Hbs.edu|accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first-year curriculum was based on [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]’s scientific management. The number of MBA students at Harvard increased quickly, from 80 in 1908, over 300 in 1920, and 1,070 in 1930.&lt;ref name="Leach 1993 288"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire: Merchants, Power, and the Rise of a New American Culture|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=PA288}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, only American universities offered MBAs. Other countries preferred that people learn business on the job.&lt;ref name="Leach 1993 288"/&gt;

==Accreditation==

===United States===
[[Business school]] or MBA program accreditation by external agencies provides students and employers with an independent view of the school or program's quality, as well as whether the curriculum meets specific quality standards. The three major accrediting bodies in the United States are:
* [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB), 
* [[Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs]] (ACBSP), and
* [[International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education]] (IACBE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | ssrn=2144954 | first1 = Kyle E. | last1 = Brink | first2 = Clair | last2 = Smith | title = A Comparison of AACSB, ACBSP, and IACBE Accredited U.S. Business Programs: An Institutional Resource Perspective | journal = Business Education &amp; Accreditation | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages=1–15 | date = 2012 | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these groups also accredit schools outside the US. The [[ACBSP]] and the [[IACBE]] are themselves recognized in the United States by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chea.org/programmatic-accrediting-organizations|title=CHEA Directory of Programmatic Accrediting Organizations}} Retrieved 23 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; MBA programs with specializations for students pursuing careers in healthcare management also eligible for accreditation by the [[Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education]] (CAHME).

US MBA programs may also be accredited at the institutional level. Bodies that accredit institutions as a whole include:
* [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] (MSA),
* [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] (NEASC),
* [[Higher Learning Commission]] (HLC),
* [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]] (NWCCU),
* [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS), and
* [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] (WASC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Other countries===
Accreditation agencies outside the United States include the [[Association of MBAs]] (AMBA), a UK-based organization that accredits MBA, DBA and MBM programs worldwide, government accreditation bodies such as the [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE), which accredits MBA and Postgraduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) programs across India. Some of the leading bodies in India that certify MBA institutions and their programs are the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the University Grants Commission (UGC). A distance MBA program needs to be accredited by the Distance Education Council (DEC) in India. The Council on Higher Education (CHE) in South Africa, the [[European Foundation for Management Development]] operates the [[European Quality Improvement System]] (EQUIS) for mostly European, Australian, New Zealand and Asian schools, the [[Foundation for International Business Administration Accreditation]] (FIBAA), and [[Central and East European Management Development Association]] (CEEMAN) in Europe.

==Programs==
Full-time MBA programs normally take place over two academic years (i.e. approximately 18 months of term time). For example, in the Northern Hemisphere they often begin in late August or early September of year one and continue until May or June of year two, with a three to four month summer break in between years one and two. Students enter with a reasonable amount of prior real-world work experience and take classes during weekdays like other university students. A typical full-time, accelerated, part-time, or modular MBA requires 60 credits (600 class hours) of graduate work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=All Business Schools | title=How Long Does it Take to Get an MBA? | url=https://www.allbusinessschools.com/mba/length-of-mba-program/ | date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accelerated MBA programs are a variation of the two-year programs. They involve a higher course load with more intense class and examination schedules and are usually condensed into one year. They usually have less down time during the program and between semesters. For example, there is no three to four-month summer break, and between semesters there might be seven to ten days off rather than three to five weeks vacation. Accelerated programs typically have a lower cost than full-time two-year programs.

Part-time MBA programs normally hold classes on weekday evenings after normal working hours, or on weekends. Part-time programs normally last three years or more. The students in these programs typically consist of working professionals, who take a light course load for a longer period of time until the graduation requirements are met.

Evening (second shift) MBA programs are full-time programs that normally hold classes on weekday evenings, after normal working hours, or on weekends for a duration of two years. The students in these programs typically consist of working professionals, who can not leave their work to pursue a full-time regular shift MBA. Most second shift programs are offered at universities in India.

Modular MBA programs are similar to part-time programs, although typically employing a lock-step curriculum with classes packaged together in blocks lasting from one to three weeks.

{{Anchor|Executive MBA (EMBA)}}Executive MBA (EMBA) programs developed to meet the educational needs of managers and executives, allowing students to earn an MBA (or another business-related graduate degree) in two years or less while working full-time. Participants come from every type and size of organization – profit, nonprofit, government – representing a variety of industries. EMBA students typically have a higher level of work experience, often 10 years or more, compared to other MBA students. In response to the increasing number of EMBA programs offered, The Executive MBA Council was formed in 1981 to advance executive education.

Full-time executive MBA programs are a new category of full-time 1 year MBA programs aimed at professionals with approx. 5 years or more. They are primarily offered in countries like India where the 2-year MBA program is targeted at fresh graduates with no experience or minimal experience. These full-time executive MBA programs are similar to 1 year MBA programs offered by schools like Insead and IMD.

[[Distance learning]] MBA programs hold classes off-campus. These programs can be offered in a number of different formats: [[correspondence course]]s by [[postal mail]] or email, non-interactive [[broadcast video]], pre-recorded video, live [[teleconference]] or [[videoconference]], offline or online computer courses. Many schools offer these programs.

Blended learning programs combine distance learning with face-to-face instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=de l'Etraz, Paris |title=What Can an Online Program Do for You? |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/Archives/NovDec10/34-39%20F-Online%20Program.pdf |date=1 November 2009 |publisher=BizEd Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924040945/http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/Archives/NovDec10/34-39%20F-Online%20Program.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs typically target working professionals who are unable to attend traditional part-time programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen Hebert-Maccaro | title=Blended MBA Programs: An Optimized Form of Learning | url=http://www.wpi.edu/academics/business/info/learning/images/pedagogy.pdf | date=8 September 2011 | publisher=Worcester Polytechnic Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MBA dual degree programs combine an MBA with others (such as an MS, MA, or a [[Juris Doctor|JD]], etc.) to let students cut costs (dual programs usually cost less than pursuing 2 degrees separately), save time on education and to tailor the business education courses to their needs. This is generally achieved by allowing core courses of one program count as electives in the other. Some business schools offer programs in which students can earn both a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[business administration]] and an MBA in five years.

[[Mini-MBA]] is a term used by many non-profit and [[for-profit]] institutions to describe a [[training]] regimen focused on the fundamentals of business. In the past, Mini-MBA programs have typically been offered as non-credit bearing courses that require less than 100 hours of total learning. However, due to the criticisms of these certificates, many schools have now shifted their programs to offer courses for full credit so that they may be applied towards a complete traditional MBA degree. This is to allow students to verify business related coursework for employment purposes and still allow the option to complete a full-time MBA degree program at a later period, if they elect to do so.

==Admissions criteria==
Many programs base their admission decisions on a combination of undergraduate grade point average, academic transcripts, entrance exam scores, a résumé containing significant work experience, essays, letters of recommendation, and personal interviews. Some schools are also interested in extracurricular activities, community service activities or volunteer work and how the student can improve the school's diversity and contribute to the student body as a whole.

The [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT) is the most prominently used entrance exam for admissions into MBA programs. The [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE) is also accepted by almost all MBA programs in order to fulfill any entrance exam requirement they may have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kitroeff, Natalie |title=Almost All Business Schools Now Accept the GRE|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-20/gre-at-business-school-most-mba-programs-now-accept-the-gre-too |date=20 October 2014|publisher=Bloomberg Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools do not weigh entrance exam scores as heavily as other criteria, and some programs do not require entrance exam scores for admission. In order to achieve a diverse class, business schools also consider the target male-female ratio and local-international student ratios. In rare cases, some MBA degrees do not require students to have an undergraduate degree and will accept significant management experience in lieu of an undergraduate degree. In the UK, for example an HND or even HNC is acceptable in some programs.

Depending on the program, type and duration of work experience can be a critical admissions component for many MBA programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why You Should Work Before Pursuing an MBA|url=http://www.bangalorean.co.in/2013/06/why-you-should-work-before-pursuing-mba.html|work=Bangalorean|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many top-tier programs require five or more years of work experience for admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MBAapplicant.com |title=Number 5 – YOUR WORK EXPERIENCE:  |url=http://www.mbaapplicant.com/5_experience.htm |date=31 July 2009 |publisher=MBA Applicant.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SMU Cox|title=Part Time MBA Programs – Side By Side Comparison |url=http://www.cox.smu.edu/web/guest/side-by-side-comparison |date=19 January 2010 |publisher=SMU Cox School of Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MBA admissions consulting services exist to counsel MBA applicants to improve their chances of getting admission to their desired Business Schools. These services range from evaluating a candidate's profile, GMAT preparation, suggesting the schools to which they can apply, writing and editing essay, conducting mock interviews as preparation for MBA admission interviews, as well as post-MBA career counseling.

==Content==
In general, MBA programs are structured around core courses (an essentially standard curriculum&lt;ref name="Core Courses"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MFT-MBA Test Description"/&gt;) and elective courses that (may) allow for a subject specialty or concentration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graduate Management Admission Council|GMAC's]] [http://www.mba.com/schools-and-programs/evaluating-schools/curriculum-and-course-selection.aspx Curriculum and Course Selection].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, 
in the program's first year (or part), students acquire both a working knowledge of management functions and the analytical skills required for these, while in the second year (part), students pursue elective courses, which may count towards a specialization.  (Topics in [[business ethics]] may be included at the generalist or specialist level.) After the first year, many full-time students seek [[internship]]s. The degree culminates with coursework in [[business strategy]], the program capstone. A [[dissertation]] or [[Project#School and university|major project]] is usually a degree requirement after the completion of coursework.  Many MBA programs end with a comprehensive exit examination; see below.

For Executive MBA programs, the core curriculum is generally similar, but may seek to leverage the strengths associated with the more seasoned and professional profile of the student body, emphasizing leadership, and drawing more from the specific experience of the individual students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rutgers.edu.sg/emba-program/executive-mba-emba-vs-traditional-mba-full-timepart-time Executive MBA (EMBA) vs. Traditional MBA], rutgers.edu.sg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insead.edu/m-programmes/MBA-vs-EMBA EXECUTIVE MBA VS MBA: THE DIFFERENCE], insead.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs are designed such that students gain exposure to theory and practice alike.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [http://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/Pages/the-hbs-case-method.aspx "The HBS case-method", hbs.edu]; [http://www.chicagobooth.edu/about/chicago-approach "The Chicago Approach", chicagobooth.edu]; [http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/mba/learning/practical-learning/ "Practical Learning", jbs.cam.ac.uk]; [http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/mba/academic-experience "Academic Experience", gsb.stanford.edu].&lt;/ref&gt; Courses include lectures, case studies, and team projects; the mix though, will differ by school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronaldyeaple/2012/07/09/is-the-mba-case-method-passe/|title=Is the MBA Case Method Passé?|first=Ronald|last=Yeaple|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[#Programs|by format]]. Theory is covered in the classroom setting by [[professor|academic faculty]], and is reinforced through the [[case method]], placing the student in the role of the decision maker. Similar to real world business situations, cases include both constraints and incomplete information. Practical learning (field immersion) often comprises [[management consulting|consulting projects]] with real clients, and is generally undertaken in teams{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} (or "syndicates"). The practical elements (as well as the case studies) often involve [[Clinical professor|external practitioners]]—sometimes business executives—supporting the teaching from academic faculty. (See [[Business school #Use of case studies]] and [[Business_school#Other_approaches|#Other approaches]].)

As above, courses begin with underlying topics&lt;ref name="Core Courses"&gt;See: [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|AACSB's]] [http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/business/standards/aol/standard15.asp Standard 15: Management of Curricula]; [[Association of MBAs|AMBA's]] [http://www.mbaworld.com/accreditationcriteria New Accreditation Criteria]; [[Educational Testing Service|ETS's]] [http://www.ets.org/mft/about/content/mba Major Field Test for the MBA].&lt;/ref&gt; and then progress to more advanced functional topics where these are applied; see aside.

The analytic skills required for management are usually covered initially.  The accounting course(s) may treat [[financial accounting|financial]] and [[management accounting]] separately or in one hybrid course.  Financial accounting deals mainly in the preparation of financial statements while management accounting deals mainly in analysis of internal results. [[Managerial economics]] is a technical course that mainly focuses on product pricing as influenced by many micro-economic theories and principals, while the aggregate or macro-economics course deals with topics like the banking system, the money supply, and inflation. [[Operations Research]] and statistics are sometimes combined as "Managerial Decision-Making" or "Quantitative Decision-Making"; organizational behavior and human resource management may similarly be combined. In many programs, applicants with appropriate background may be exempt from various of the analytical courses.

As regards the functional courses, some programs treat the curricula here in two parts: the first course provides an overview, while the second revisits the subject in depth (perhaps as specializations); alternatively, the first addresses short-term, tactical problems, while the second addresses long-term, strategic problems (e.g., "Financial Management I" might cover [[working capital management]], while part II covers [[Corporate finance#Investment and project valuation|capital investment decisions]]).  An [[Information systems]] / [[Information technology|technology]] course is increasingly included as a core functional course rather than an elective. Ethics training is often delivered with coursework in corporate social responsibility and corporate governance. Note that courses here, although technical in content are, ultimately, oriented toward corporate management. (For example, the principal finance course may cover the technicalities  of financial instrument valuation and [[Capital market|capital raising]], but is in fact focused on [[managerial finance|managerial-]] and [[corporate finance]].)  Technically-oriented courses, if offered, will be via a specialization.

Programs may also include (coursework-based) training in the skills needed at senior levels of management:  [[soft skills]], such as (general) leadership and negotiation; hard skills, such as [[spreadsheets]] and project management; [[Outline of thought#Creative processes|thinking skills]] such as [[innovation]] and creativity. Training in areas such as [[multiculturalism]] and corporate social responsibility is similarly included. Company visits (including overseas travel), and guest lectures or seminars with CEOs and [[Business guru|management personalities]] may also be included. These, with the core subjects, provide the graduate with breadth, while the specialty courses provide depth.

For the business strategy component, the degree capstone, the focus is on finding [[competitive advantage]] and the long-term positioning and management of the entity as a whole.  Here, the key functional areas are thus synthesized or integrated into an overall view and the strategy course depicts how the various sub-disciplines integrate to tell one continuous story with each discipline complementing the others.  Corresponding training in [[entrepreneurial leadership|business leadership]] may also be scheduled and participation in a [[business simulation]] or [[business game|game]] is also a common degree requirement. "Strategy" may be offered as a sequence of courses, beginning in the first part (planning) and culminating in the second (execution), or as a single intensive course, offered during the second part. Some programs offer a specialization in "strategy", others in management consulting which substantially addresses the same issues.

The MBA dissertation (or thesis in some universities) will, in general, comprise the following in some combination:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kangis | first1 = Peter | last2 = Carman | first2 = Robert | year = | title = Research, Knowledge and Method: the purpose and role of MBA dissertation | url = http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/bmaf/documents/publications/ijme/vol1no2/kangis_purpose_of_mba_dissert.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The International Journal of Management Education | volume = 1 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[literature review|discussion of the literature]], providing a critical review and structuring of what is known on a given topic, with a view to addressing a specific problem; a [[case study]] that goes beyond simple description, containing the analysis of hitherto unpublished material; a test of the application or limitations of some known principle or technique in a particular situation, and / or suggested modifications. As an alternative to the dissertation, some programs instead allow for a major project.&lt;ref name="degree.net"/&gt; Here (part-time) students will address a problem current in their organization; particularly in programs with an [[action learning]] orientation, these may be practically oriented.&lt;ref name="degree.net"&gt;[http://www.degree.net/resources/degree-level/mba-degree-guide_201002182375.html MBA degree-guide], degree.net&lt;/ref&gt; Most MBA programs require additional course work in research methodology, preceding the dissertation or project. Some programs allow that the research component as a whole may be substituted with additional elective coursework.

===Exit examination===
Many MBA programs culminate in a [[Comprehensive examination|comprehensive exit examination]]. The national [[standardized exam]] known as the [[Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration|Major Field Test for MBAs]] (MFT-MBA) has been administered in the MBA programs of over 300 U.S. universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |title=2013 Major Field Test Comparative Data Guide: Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration (MBA) |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=20 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194137/http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |archivedate=22 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MFT-MBA aims to assess skills, knowledge, and reasoning ability within the domain of standard MBA curriculum.&lt;ref name="MFT-MBA Test Description"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/mft_mba_flyer.pdf |title=MFT-MBA Test Description |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is administered by [[Educational Testing Service]]. Another prominent option for comprehensive exit exams is the Common Professional Component Comprehensive Exam for MBAs (CPC COMP Exam for MBAs) owned by Peregrine Academic Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.peregrineacademics.com/media.ashx/exam-summary-business-compgraduatefinal29oct2014.pdf |title=Business Administration CPC-Based COMP Exam Summary: Masters Level |publisher=Peregrine Academic Services |accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programs choose to administer their own in-house exam rather than a standardized test.

===History===
In 1957, INSEAD (French name "Institut Européen d'Administration des Affaires", or European Institute of Business Administration) became the first European university offering the MBA degree,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kaplan A.: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools, European Management Journal, 2014 | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[EDHEC]] Business School in 1959 and [[ICADE]] in 1960 (who had started offering in 1956 a "Technical Seminary for Business Administration"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icade.es/presentacion/pres_hist.aspx?nivel=3&amp;id=90 Historia de la Universidad Pontificia Comillas].

Vlerick.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1969 by the [[HEC School of Management]] (in French, the École des Hautes Études Commerciales) and the [[Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris]]. In 1972, Swiss business school [[IMEDE]] (now [[International Institute for Management Development|IMD]]) began offering a full-time MBA program, followed by [[IE Business School]] (in Spanish, Instituto de Empresas) in 1973, and AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow, Poland in 1974. In 1991, [[IEDC-Bled School of Management]] became the first school in the ex-socialist block of the Central and Eastern to offer an MBA degree.

===Bologna Accord===
In Europe, the recent [[Bologna Accord]] established uniformity in three levels of higher education: Bachelor (three or four years), Masters (one or two years, in addition to three or four years for a Bachelor), and Doctorate (an additional three or four years after a Master). Students can acquire professional experience after their initial bachelor's degree at any European institution and later complete their masters in any other European institution via the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]].

===Accreditation standards===
Accreditation standards are not uniform in Europe. Some countries have legal requirements for accreditation (e.g. most German states), in some there is a legal requirement only for universities of a certain type (e.g. Austria), and others have no accreditation law at all. Even where there is no legal requirement, many business schools are [[School accreditation|accredited]] by independent bodies voluntarily to ensure quality standards.

===Austria===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
In Austria, MBA programs of [[private university|private universities]] have to be accredited by the Austrian Accreditation Council (''Österreichischer Akkreditierungsrat''). State-run universities have no accreditation requirements, however, some of them voluntarily undergo accreditation procedures by independent bodies. There are also MBA programs of non-academic business schools, who are entitled by the Austrian government to offer these programs until the end of 2012 (''Lehrgang universitären Charakters''). Some non-academic institutions cooperate with state-run universities to ensure legality of their degrees.

===Czech Republic===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;

&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
In France and in the [[Francophone]] countries such as Switzerland, Monaco, Belgium, and Canada, the MBA degree programs at the public accredited schools are similar to those offered in the [[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] countries.

===Germany===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;
Germany was one of the last Western countries to adopt the MBA degree. In 1998, the ''Hochschulrahmengesetz'' (Higher Education Framework Act), a German federal law regulating higher education including the types of degrees offered, was modified to permit German universities to offer master's degrees. The traditional German degree in business administration was the [[Diplom]] in ''Betriebswirtschaft'' (Diplom-Kaufmann) but since 1999, bachelor's and master's degrees have gradually replaced the traditional degrees due to the [[Bologna process]]. Today most German business schools offer the MBA. Most [[States of Germany|German states]] require that MBA degrees have to be accredited by one of the six agencies officially recognized by the German ''Akkreditierungsrat''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akkreditierungsrat.de/index.php?id=44&amp;L=1|work=Akkreditierungsrat.de|title=Accreditation Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; (accreditation council), the German counterpart to the American [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation|CHEA]]. The busiest of these six agencies (in respect to MBA degrees) is the Foundation for International Business Administration Accreditation (FIBAA). All universities themselves have to be institutionally accredited by the state (''staatlich anerkannt'').

===Japan===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;

In Japan 2 business schools offer the accredited MBA degree (AACSB, AMBA or EQUIS). The concept of an MBA is still not considered mainstream as traditional companies still perceive that knowledge and learning with respect to business and management can only be effectively gained through experience and not within a classroom. In fact, some companies have been known to place recent MBA recipients in unrelated fields, or try to re-acclimate their Japanese employees who have spent years overseas earning the degree. As a consequence, academic institutions in Japan are attempting to reinvent the perception of the MBA degree, by taking into account the local corporate culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=The New York Times | title=M.B.A.s in Japan Struggle for Respect

Today, publications by the [[Aspen Institute]], ''[[Business Week]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''[[Forbes]]'', [[Quacquarelli Symonds]], ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'', and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''  make their own rankings of MBA programs. Schools' ranks can vary across publications, as the methodologies for rankings differ among publications:

* The [[Aspen Institute]] publishes the ''Beyond Grey Pinstripes'' rankings which are based on the integration of social and environmental stewardship into university curriculum and faculty research. Rankings from a small sample of well-known schools are calculated on the amount of [[sustainability]] coursework made available to students (20%), amount of student exposure to relevant material (25%), amount of coursework focused on stewardship by for-profit corporations (30%), and relevant faculty research (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondgreypinstripes.org/about/methodology.cfm|title=Methodology|accessdate=18 June 2011|publisher=Beyond Grey Pinstripes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 survey and ranking include data from 150 universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samuelson|first=Judy|title=The Business of Education: Why change-minded MBA candidates turn to the Institute before they pick a business school|journal=The Aspen Idea|date=Summer 2011|pages=66–67|url=http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|accessdate=18 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712011811/http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|archivedate=12 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Forbes'' considers only the return of investment five years after graduation. MBA alumni are asked about their salary, the tuition fees of their MBA program and other direct costs as well as opportunity costs involved.

The ranking of MBA programs has been discussed in articles and on academic websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Caution and Controversy |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] |url=http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm |accessdate=6 September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026081654/http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm |archivedate=26 October 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of ranking methodologies maintain that any published rankings should be viewed with caution for the following reasons:&lt;ref name="MRN"&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Schatz |first=Martin |title=What's Wrong with MBA Ranking Surveys? |journal=Management Research News |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=15–18 |year=1993 |url=http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |doi=10.1108/eb028322 |last2=Crummer |first2=Roy E. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412110850/http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |archivedate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rankings exhibit intentional selection bias as they limit the surveyed population to a small number of MBA programs and ignore the majority of schools, many with excellent offerings.
* Ranking methods may be subject to personal biases and statistically flawed methodologies (especially methods relying on subjective interviews of hiring managers, students, or faculty).
* Rankings use no objective measures of program quality.
* The same list of schools appears in each ranking with some variation in ranks, so a school ranked as number 1 in one list may be number 17 in another list.
* Rankings tend to concentrate on representing MBA schools themselves, but some schools offer MBA programs of different qualities and yet the ranking will only rely upon information from the full-time program (e.g., a school may use highly reputable faculty to teach a daytime program, but use adjunct faculty in its evening program or have drastically lower admissions criteria for its evening program than for its daytime program).
* A high rank in a national publication tends to become a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].
* Some leading business schools including Harvard, INSEAD, Wharton and [[MIT Sloan School of Management|Sloan]] provide limited cooperation with certain ranking publications due to their perception that rankings are misused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hemel |first=Daniel J |title=HBS Blocks Media Access to Students |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date=12 April 2004 |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=358753 |accessdate=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that ranking MBA programs by a combination of graduates' starting salaries and average student GMAT score can approximately duplicate the top 20 list of the national publications, and concluded that a truly objective ranking would use objective measures of program quality and be individualized to the needs of each prospective student.&lt;ref name="MRN" /&gt; National publications have recognized the value of rankings against different criteria, and now offer lists ranked different ways: by salary, GMAT score of students, selectivity, and so forth. While useful, these rankings have yet to meet the critique that rankings are not tailored to individual needs, that they use an incomplete population of schools, may fail to distinguish between the different MBA program types offered by each school, or rely on subjective interviews.

==Criticism==
The media raised questions about the value and content of business school programs after the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]]. In general, graduates had reportedly tended to go into finance after receiving their degrees.&lt;ref name="retrain"&gt;{{cite news|author=Holland, Kelley | title=Is It Time to Retrain B-Schools? | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/y15/business/15school.html | date=14 March 2009 | newspaper=Th York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; As financial professionals are widely seen as responsible for the global economic meltdown, anecdotal evidence suggests new graduates are choosing different career paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stossel, John | title=The New Normal | publisher=ABC News | newspaper=20/20 | date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deans at top business schools have acknowledged that media and public perception of the MBA degree shifted as a result of the financial crisis.&lt;ref name="overhaul"&gt;{{cite news | author=Bradshaw, Della | title=Deans fight crisis fires with MBA overhaul | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a2353870-53c4-11de-be08-00144feabdc0.html | date=18 June 2009 |newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles have been written about public perceptions of the crisis, ranging from schools' acknowledgment of issues with the training students receive&lt;ref name="retrain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="overhaul"/&gt; to criticisms of the MBA's role in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Stewart, Matthew | title=RIP, MBA | url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/29895258 | date=25 March 2009 | publisher=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MBA title has acquired a mixed reputation in that the MBA curriculum tends to educate students in the "[[greed]] is good" direction based on various simplistic assumptions about human behaviour.&lt;ref name="Parker 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Parker | first=Martin | title=Why we should bulldoze the business school | website=the Guardian | date=2018-04-27 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/27/bulldoze-the-business-school | access-date=2018-05-24|quote=There are 13,000 business schools on Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1498">The '''McIntire–Stennis Act of 1962''' (P.L. 87-788) makes funding available to the state agricultural experimental stations and to [[forestry school]]s and programs at the [[land grant colleges]] of agriculture for forestry research. The research covers such areas as [[reforestation]], woodlands and related [[Drainage basin|watershed]] management, outdoor recreation, [[wildlife habitat]]s and wood utilization. Many of the research projects are performed cooperatively with scientists at the laboratories of the [[United States Forest Service]].

[https://nifa.usda.gov/program/mcintire-stennis-capacity-grant McIntire-Stennis] funds are distributed by a formula that allocates $10,000 to each state, with 40% of the remainder being distributed according to a state’s share of the nation’s total commercial forest land, 40% according to the value of its timber cut annually, and 20% according to its state appropriation for forestry research.

==Vehicle==
For instance, a given car traveling on a road of a given slope presents a load which the engine must act against. Because air resistance increases with speed, the motor must put out more [[torque]] at a higher speed in order to maintain the speed. By shifting to a higher gear, one may be able to meet the requirement with a higher torque and a lower engine speed, whereas shifting to a lower gear has the opposite effect. Accelerating increases the load, whereas decelerating decreases the load.

==Pump==
Similarly, the load on a [[pump]] depends on the [[hydrostatic head|head]] against which the pump is pumping, and on the size of the pump.

==Fan==
Similar considerations apply to a [[Mechanical fan|fan]]. See [[Affinity laws]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32551">'''Metatranscriptomics''' is the science that studies [[gene]] expression of [[microbes]] within natural environments. It also allows to obtain whole gene expression profiling of complex microbial communities.&lt;ref name="Filiatrault_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Filiatrault MJ | title = Progress in prokaryotic transcriptomics | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 579–86 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21839669 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2011.07.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[metagenomics]] focuses on studying the genomic content and on identifying which microbes are present within a community, metatranscriptomics can be used to study the diversity of the active genes within such community, to quantify their expression levels and to monitor how these levels change in different conditions (e.g., physiological vs. pathological conditions in an organism). The advantage of metatranscriptomics is that it can provide information about differences in the active functions of [[microbial communities]] which appear to be the same in terms of microbe composition.&lt;ref name="pmid27127406"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bashiardes S, Zilberman-Schapira G, Elinav E | title = Use of Metatranscriptomics in Microbiome Research | journal = Bioinformatics and Biology Insights | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 19–25 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27127406 | pmc = 4839964 | doi = 10.4137/BBI.S34610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
The [[microbiome]] has been defined as a microbial community occupying a well-defined habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Whipps JM, Lewis K, Cooke RC | title = Mycoparasitism and Plant Disease Control. | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester, UK | date = 1988 | pages = 161–87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are ubiquitous and extremely relevant for the maintenance of” the characteristic of the environment in which they reside and an imbalance in these communities can affect negatively the activity of the setting in which they reside. 
To study these communities, and to then determine their impact and correlation with their niche, different omics- approaches have been used. While metagenomics allows to obtain a taxonomic profile of the sample, metatrascriptomics provides a functional profile by analysing which genes are expressed by the community. 
It is possible to infer what genes are expressed under specific conditions, and this can be done using functional annotations of expressed genes.

== Function ==
Since metatranscriptomics focuses on what genes are expressed, it allows to understand the active functional profile of the entire microbial community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moran MA | title = Metatranscriptomics: eavesdropping on complex microbial communities. | journal = Microbiome | date = 2009 | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 329–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The overview of the gene expression in a given sample is obtained by capturing the total [[mRNA]] of the microbiome and by performing a whole metatranscriptomics [[shotgun sequencing]].

== Tools and techniques ==
Although microarrays can be exploited to determine the gene expression profiles of some model organisms, NGS is the preferred technique in metatranscriptomics. The protocol that is used to perform a metatranscriptome analysis may vary depending on the type of sample that needs to be analysed. Indeed, many different protocols have been developed for studying the metatranscriptome of microbial samples. Generally, the steps include sample harvesting, RNA extraction (different extraction methods for different kinds of samples have been reported in the literature), mRNA enrichment, cDNA synthesis and preparation of metatranscriptomic libraries, sequencing and data processing and analysis.
mRNA enrichment is one of the trickiest parts. Different strategies have been proposed:
* removing rRNA through Ribosomal RNA capture
* using a 5-3 exonuclease to degrade processed RNAs (mostly rRNA and tRNA&lt;ref name="pmid7682412"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Apirion D, Miczak A | title = RNA processing in prokaryotic cells | journal = BioEssays : News and Reviews in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–20 | date = February 1993 | pmid = 7682412 | doi = 10.1002/bies.950150207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* adding poly(A) to mRNAs by using a polyA polymerase (in E. coli)
* using antibodies to capture mRNAs that bind to specific proteins
The last two strategies are not recommended as they have been reported to be highly biased.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Mariana | last1 = Peimbert | first2 = Luis D | last2 = Alcaraz | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2016 | chapter = A Hitchhiker’s Guide to Metatranscriptomics | title = Field Guidelines for Genetic Experimental Designs in High-Throughput Sequencing | pages = 313–342 | publisher = Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computational analysis ==
A typical metatranscriptom¬e analysis pipeline:
*maps reads to a reference genome or
*performs de novo assembly of the reads into transcript contigs and supercontigs
The first strategy maps reads to reference genomes in databases, to collect information that is useful to deduce the relative expression of the single genes.
Metatran¬scriptomic reads are mapped against databases using alignment tools, such as Bowtie2, BWA, and BLAST. Then, the results are annotated using resources, such as GO, KEGG, COG, and Swiss-Prot. The final analysis of the results is carried out depending on the aim of the study.
One of the latest metatranscriptomics techniques is stable isotope probing (SIP), which has been used to retrieve specific targeted transcriptomes of aerobic microbes in lake sediment.&lt;ref name="pmid24115627"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dumont MG, Pommerenke B, Casper P | title = Using stable isotope probing to obtain a targeted metatranscriptome of aerobic methanotrophs in lake sediment | journal = Environmental Microbiology Reports | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 757–64 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24115627 | doi = 10.1111/1758-2229.12078 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The limitation of this strategy is its reliance on the information of reference genomes in databases.
The second strategy retrieves the abundance in the expression of the different genes by assembling metatranscrip¬tomic reads into longer fragments called contigs using different softwares. So, its limits  depend on the software that is used for the assembly.
The Trinity software for RNA-seq, in comparison with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, was reported to recover more full-length transcripts over a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. This is particularly important in the absence of a reference genome.&lt;ref name="pmid21572440"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grabherr MG, Haas BJ, Yassour M, Levin JZ, Thompson DA, Amit I, Adiconis X, Fan L, Raychowdhury R, Zeng Q, Chen Z, Mauceli E, Hacohen N, Gnirke A, Rhind N, di Palma F, Birren BW, Nusbaum C, Lindblad-Toh K, Friedman N, Regev A | display-authors = 6 | title = Full-length transcriptome assembly from RNA-Seq data without a reference genome | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 29 | issue = 7 | pages = 644–52 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21572440 | pmc = 3571712 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.1883 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rsem: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-seq data with or without a reference genome. BMC Bioinformatics. 2011;12(1):323.&lt;/ref&gt; and called RSEM (RNA-Seq by Expectation Maximization). It can work as stand-alone software or as a plug-in for Trinity. 
RSEM starts with a reference transcriptome or assembly along with RNA-Seq reads generated from the sample and calculates normalized transcript abundance (meaning the number of RNA-Seq reads cor-responding to each reference transcriptome or assembly).&lt;ref name="pmid23845962"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haas BJ, Papanicolaou A, Yassour M, Grabherr M, Blood PD, Bowden J, Couger MB, Eccles D, Li B, Lieber M, MacManes MD, Ott M, Orvis J, Pochet N, Strozzi F, Weeks N, Westerman R, William T, Dewey CN, Henschel R, LeDuc RD, Friedman N, Regev A | title = De novo transcript sequence reconstruction from RNA-seq using the Trinity platform for reference generation and analysis | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 1494–512 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23845962 | pmc = 3875132 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2013.084 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18689821"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = De Bona F, Ossowski S, Schneeberger K, Rätsch G | title = Optimal spliced alignments of short sequence reads | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 24 | issue = 16 | pages = i174–80 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18689821 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although both Trinity and RSEM were designed for tran¬scriptomic datasets (i.e., obtained from a single organism), it may be possible to apply them to metatranscriptomic data (i.e., obtained from a whole microbial community).

Given the huge amount of data obtained from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis, the use of bioinformatic tools have become of greater importance in the last decades. In order to achieve so, many different bioinformatic pipelines have been developed, often as open source platforms, such as HUMAnN and the most recent HUMAnN2, MetaTrans, SAMSA and Leimena-2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Niu SY, Yang J, McDermaid A, Zhao J, Kang Y, Ma Q | title = Bioinformatics tools for quantitative and functional metagenome and metatranscriptome data analysis in microbes | journal = Briefings in Bioinformatics | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 1415–1429 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 28481971 | doi = 10.1093/bib/bbx051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HUMAnN2===
HUMAnN2 is a bioinformatic pipeline designed from the latter HUMAnN developed during the [[Human Microbiome Project]] (HMP), implementing a “tiered search” approach. In the first tier, HUMAnN2 screens DNA or RNA reads with MetaPhlAn2 in order to identify already known microbes and constructing a sample-specific database by merging pangenomes of annotated species; in the second tier the algorithm performs a mapping of the reads against the assembled pangenome database; in the third tier, non-aligned reads are used for a translated search against a protein database &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franzosa EA, McIver LJ, Rahnavard G, Thompson LR, Schirmer M, Weingart G, Lipson KS, Knight R, Caporaso JG, Segata N, Huttenhower C | title = Species-level functional profiling of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes | language = En | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 962–968 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30377376 | pmc = 6235447 | doi = 10.1038/s41592-018-0176-y | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0176-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MetaTrans===
MetaTrans is a pipeline that exploits multi-threading computers to improve metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis. Data is obtained from paired-end RNA-Seq, mainly from 16S RNA for taxonomy and mRNA for gene expression levels. The pipeline is divided in 4 major steps. Firstly, paired-end reads are filtered for quality control purposes, to be thereafter sorted for taxonomic analysis (by removal of tRNA sequences) or functional analysis (by removal of both tRNA and rRNA sequencing). For the taxonomic analysis, sequences are mapped against 16S rRNA Greengenes v13.5 database using SOAP2, while for functional analysis sequences are mapped against a functional database such as MetaHIT-2014 always by using SOAP2 tool. This pipeline is highly flexible, since it offers the possibility to use third-party tools and improve single modules as long as the general structure is preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinez X, Pozuelo M, Pascal V, Campos D, Gut I, Gut M, Azpiroz F, Guarner F, Manichanh C | title = MetaTrans: an open-source pipeline for metatranscriptomics | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 26447 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27211518 | pmc = 4876386 | doi = 10.1038/srep26447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SAMSA===
This pipeline is designed specifically for metatranscriptomics data analysis, by working in conjunction with the [[MG-RAST]] server for metagenomics. This pipeline is simple to use, requires low technical preparation and computational power and can be applied to a wide range of microbes. The algorithm is divided in 4 steps. At first, sequences from raw sequencing data are selected on quality basis and are then submitted to MG-RAST (which foresee different steps such as quality control check, gene calling, clustering of amino acid sequences and use of sBLAT on each cluster to detect the best matches). Matches are then aggregated for taxonomic and functional analysis purposes, that usually follow up as last steps of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westreich ST, Korf I, Mills DA, Lemay DG | title = SAMSA: a comprehensive metatranscriptome analysis pipeline | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 399 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27687690 | pmc = 5041328 | doi = 10.1186/s12859-016-1270-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leimena-2013===
This pipeline actually does not have a name so that it is usually reckoned with the first name of the author of the article in which it is described. This algorithm foresees the implementation of alignment tools such as BLAST and MegaBLAST. Reads, usually obtained by Illumina sequencing, are clustered in identical-reads clusters and are then processed for in-silico removal of t-RNA and r-RNA sequences. Remaining reads are then mapped on NCBI databases by using BLAST and MegaBLAST tools and classified by their bitscore. Higher bitscore sequences are thereby interpreted to predict phylogenetic origin and function. Lower score reads instead are aligned with BLASTX (higher sensitivity) and eventually can be aligned in protein databases so that their function can be characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leimena MM, Ramiro-Garcia J, Davids M, van den Bogert B, Smidt H, Smid EJ, Boekhorst J, Zoetendal EG, Schaap PJ, Kleerebezem M | title = A comprehensive metatranscriptome analysis pipeline and its validation using human small intestine microbiota datasets | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 14 | pages = 530 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23915218 | pmc = 3750648 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-14-530 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microarray ==
Another method that can be exploited for metatranscriptomic purposes is [[Tiling array|Tiling Microarrays]].   
In particular, microarrays have been used to measure microbial transcription levels, to detect new transcripts and to obtain information about the structure of mRNAs (for instance, the UTR boundaries). Recently, it has also been used to find new regulatory ncRNA. 
However, microarrays are affected by some pitfalls:
*requirement of probe design
*low sensitivity 
*prior knowledge of gene targets. 
RNA-Seq can overcome these limitations: it does not require any previous knowledge about the genomes that have to be analysed and it provides high throughput validation of genes prediction, structure, expression. Thus, by combining the two approaches it is possible to have a more complete representation of bacterial transcriptome.&lt;ref name="Filiatrault_2011" /&gt;

==Limits of the metatranscriptomic techniques==
*With its dominating abundance, ribosomal RNA strongly reduces the coverage of mRNA (main focus of transcriptomic studies) in the total collected RNA.
*Extraction of high-quality RNA from some biological or environmental samples (such as feces) can be difficult
* Instability of mRNA that compromises sample integrity even before sequencing. 
*Experimental issues can affect the quantification of differences in expression among multiple samples: They can influence integrity and input RNA, as well as the amount of rRNA remaining in the samples, size section and gene models. Moreover, molecular base techniques are very prone to artefacts.
*Difficulties in differentiating between host and microbial RNA, although com¬mercial kits for the microbial enrichment are available. This may also be done in silico if a reference genome is available for the host. 
*Transcriptome reference databases are limited in their coverage.
*Generally, large populations of cells are exploited in metatranscriptomic analysis, so it is difficult to resolve important variances that can exist between subpopulations. Actually, high variability in pathogen populations was demonstrated to affect disease progression and virulence. 
*Both for microarray and RNA-Seq, it is difficult to set a real “cut off” in order to consider the genes as “express”, due to the high dynamic range in gene expression.
*The presence of mRNA is not always associated with the actual presence of the respective protein.&lt;ref name="Filiatrault_2011" /&gt;

==Metatrascriptomics and Gut Microbiome==
The gut microbiome has emerged in recent years as an important player in human health. Its prevalent functions are related to the fermentation of indigestible food components, competitions with pathogen, strengthening of the intestinal barrier, stimulation and regulation of the immune system.&lt;ref name="pmid21314432"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karasov WH, Martínez del Rio C, Caviedes-Vidal E | title = Ecological physiology of diet and digestive systems | journal = Annual Review of Physiology | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 69–93 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21314432 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-physiol-012110-142152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22940212"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = LeBlanc JG, Milani C, de Giori GS, Sesma F, van Sinderen D, Ventura M | title = Bacteria as vitamin suppliers to their host: a gut microbiota perspective | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 160–8 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 22940212 | doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2012.08.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28721242"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Claus SP, Guillou H, Ellero-Simatos S | title = The gut microbiota: a major player in the toxicity of environmental pollutants? | journal = NPJ Biofilms and Microbiomes | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 16003 | date = 2016 | pmid = 28721242 | pmc = 5515271 | doi = 10.1038/npjbiofilms.2016.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23618829"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamada N, Seo SU, Chen GY, Núñez G | title = Role of the gut microbiota in immunity and inflammatory disease | journal = Nature Reviews.

Although much has been learnt about the microbiome community in the last years, the wide diversity of microorganisms and molecules in the gut requires new tools to enable new discoveries. 
By focusing on the changes in the expression of the genes, metatrascriptomics allows to take a more dynamic picture of the state and activity of the microbiome than metagenomics. It has been observed that metatranscriptomic functional profiles are more variable than what might have been reckoned only by metagenomic information. This suggests that non-housekeeping genes are not stably expressed in situ&lt;ref name="pmid21408168"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gosalbes MJ, Durbán A, Pignatelli M, Abellan JJ, Jiménez-Hernández N, Pérez-Cobas AE, Latorre A, Moya A | title = Metatranscriptomic approach to analyze the functional human gut microbiota | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = e17447 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21408168 | pmc = 3050895 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0017447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24843156"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franzosa EA, Morgan XC, Segata N, Waldron L, Reyes J, Earl AM, Giannoukos G, Boylan MR, Ciulla D, Gevers D, Izard J, Garrett WS, Chan AT, Huttenhower C | title = Relating the metatranscriptome and metagenome of the human gut | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 22 | pages = E2329–38 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24843156 | pmc = 4050606 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1319284111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
One example of metatranscriptomic application is in the study of the gut microbiome in inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic diseases of the digestive tract that affects millions of people worldwide.&lt;ref name="pmid23395397"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burisch J, Jess T, Martinato M, Lakatos PL | title = The burden of inflammatory bowel disease in Europe | journal = Journal of Crohn's &amp; Colitis | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 322–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23395397 | doi = 10.1016/j.crohns.2013.01.010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several human genetic mutations have been linked to an increased susceptibility to IBD, but additional factors are needed for the full development of the disease.
Regarding the relationship between IBD and gut microbiome, it is known that there is a dysbiosis in patients with IBD but microbial taxonomic profiles can be highly different among patients, making it difficult to implicate specific microbial species or strains in disease onset and progression. In addition, the gut microbiome composition presents a high variability over time among people, with more pronounced variations in patient with IBD.&lt;ref name="Halfvarson_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Halfvarson J, Brislawn CJ, Lamendella R, Vázquez-Baeza Y, Walters WA, Bramer LM, D'Amato M, Bonfiglio F, McDonald D, Gonzalez A, McClure EE, Dunklebarger MF, Knight R, Jansson JK | title = Dynamics of the human gut microbiome in inflammatory bowel disease | journal = Nature Microbiology | volume = 2 | issue = 5| pages = 17004 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28191884 | pmc = 5319707 | doi = 10.1038/nmicrobiol.2017.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26468751"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewis JD, Chen EZ, Baldassano RN, Otley AR, Griffiths AM, Lee D, Bittinger K, Bailey A, Friedman ES, Hoffmann C, Albenberg L, Sinha R, Compher C, Gilroy E, Nessel L, Grant A, Chehoud C, Li H, Wu GD, Bushman FD | display-authors = 6 | title = Inflammation, Antibiotics, and Diet as Environmental Stressors of the Gut Microbiome in Pediatric Crohn's Disease | journal = Cell Host &amp; Microbe | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 489–500 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26468751 | pmc = 4633303 | doi = 10.1016/j.chom.2015.09.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The functional potential of an organism, meaning the genes and pathways encoded in its genome, provides only indirect information about the level or extent of activation of such functions. So, the measurement of functional activity (gene expression) is critical to understand the mechanism of the gut microbiome dysbiosis.
Alterations in transcriptional activity in IBD, established on the rRNA expression, indicate that some bacterial populations are active in patients with IBD, while other groups are inactive or latent.&lt;ref name="pmid20522625"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rehman A, Lepage P, Nolte A, Hellmig S, Schreiber S, Ott SJ | title = Transcriptional activity of the dominant gut mucosal microbiota in chronic inflammatory bowel disease patients | journal = Journal of Medical Microbiology | volume = 59 | issue = Pt 9 | pages = 1114–22 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20522625 | doi = 10.1099/jmm.0.021170-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A metatranscriptomics analysis measuring the functional activity of the gut microbiome reveals insights only partially observable in metagenomic functional potential, including disease-linked observations for IBD. It has been reported that many IBD-specific signals are either more pronounced or only detectable on the RNA level.&lt;ref name="Halfvarson_2017" /&gt;
These altered expression profiles are potentially the result of changes in the gut environment in patients with IBD, which include increased levels of inflammation, higher concentrations of oxygen and a diminished mucous layer.&lt;ref name="pmid24149677"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Naughton J, Duggan G, Bourke B, Clyne M | title = Interaction of microbes with mucus and mucins: recent developments | journal = Gut Microbes | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–52 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24149677 | pmc = 4049936 | doi = 10.4161/gmic.26680 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Metatranscriptomics has the advantage of allowing to skip the assaying of biochemical products in situ (like mucus or oxygen) and allows to study the effects of environmental changes on microbial expression patterns in vivo for large human populations.
In addition, it can be coupled with longitudinal sampling to associate modulation of activity with the disease progression. Indeed, it has been shown that while a particular path may remain stable over time at the genomic level, the corresponding expression varies with the disease severity.&lt;ref name="Halfvarson_2017" /&gt; This suggests that microbial dysbiosis affect the gut health through changing in the transcriptional programmes in a stable community. In this way, metatracriptomic profiling emerges as an important tool for understanding the mechanisms of that relationship.
Some technical limitations of the RNA measurements in stool are related to the fact that the extracted RNA can be degraded and, if not, it still represents only the organisms presents in the stool sample.
Other applications of metagenomics:
*Directed culturing: it was used to understand nutritional preferences of organisms in order to allow the preparation of a proper culture medium, resulting in a successful isolation of microbes in vitro.&lt;ref name="Filiatrault_2011" /&gt;
*Identify potential virulence factors: through comparative transcriptomics, in order to compare different transcriptional responses of related strains or species after specific stimuli.
*Identify host-specific biological processes and interactions For this purpose, it’s important to develop new technologies which allow the detection, at the same time, of changes in the expression levels of some genes.
Examples of techniques applied:
Microarrays: allow the monitoring of changes in the expression levels of many genes in parallel for both host and pathogen. First microarray approaches have shown the first global analysis of gene expression changes in pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica, revealing the strategies that are used by these microorganisms to adapt to the host.
In addition, microarrays only provide the first global insights about the host innate immune response to PAMPs, as the effects of bacterial infection on the expression of various host factor.
Anyway, the detection through microarrays of both organisms at the same time could be problematic.
Problems:
*Probe selection (hundreds of millions of different probes)
*Cross-hybridization
*Need of expensive chips (with the proper design; high-density arrays)
*Require the pathogen and host cells to be physically separated before gene expression analysis (eukaryotic cells’ transcriptomes are larger in comparison to the pathogens’ ones, so could happen that the signal from pathogens’ RNAs is hidden). 
*Loss of RNA molecules during the eukaryotic cells lysis.
	

Dual RNA-Seq: this technique allows the simultaneous study of both host and pathogen transcriptomes as well. It is possible to monitor the expression of genes at different time points of the infection process; in this way could it be possible to study the changes in cellular networks in both organisms starting from the initial contact until the manipulation of the host (interplay host-patogen). 
*Potential: No need of expensive chips
*Probe-independent approach (RNA-seq provides transcript information without prior knowledge of mRNA sequences)
*High sensitivity.
*Possibility of studying the expression levels of even unknown genes under different conditions
Moreover, RNA-Seq is an important approach for identifying coregulated genes, enabling the organization of pathogen genomes into operons. Indeed, genome annotation has been done for some eukaryotic pathogens, such as Candida albicans, Trypanosoma brucei and Plasmodium falciparum.
Despite the increasing sensitivity and depth of sequencing now available, there are still few published RNA-Seq studies concerning the response of the mammalian host cell to the infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westermann AJ, Gorski SA, Vogel J | title = Dual RNA-seq of pathogen and host | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | date = September 2012 | volume = 10| issue = 9 | pages = 618–630 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2852 | pmid = 22890146 | url = https://opus.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/11246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28214646"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saliba AE, C Santos S, Vogel J | title = New RNA-seq approaches for the study of bacterial pathogens | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 78–87 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28214646 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2017.01.001  | hdl = 10033/621506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''music community''' is a group of people involved in a given type of music. Typically such a community has an informal, supportive structure.
In the past such groups have typically developed within a town or school, where the members can meet physically. The internet has made it possible for a more dispersed music community to use the web for communication, either via specialized websites or through broader social media. Ethnographic studies indicate that online music communities do not center around one website, but use a network of sites, including personal blogs, artist or publisher sites and social media.

==General==

The musician and musicologist [[Mícheál Ó Súilleabháin]] has broadly defined a music community as "a group of interested participants who agree on the form and content of the music and its social contexts".{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=122}}
A music community may be taken to mean a group of people with strong ties who often come together to play and talk about music, but a sense of community may also come from a national educational system that connects young people to their cultural heritage and traditions.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=122–123}}
A more restrictive view limits the term "music community" to teachers, composers, performers and the music distribution industry.{{sfn|National Commission on Music Education|1991|p=xi}}

The concept of music communities is well-developed in [[ethnomusicology]]. A large part of this discipline consists of studies of groups of people who frequently exchange and communicate musical material.{{sfn|Nettl|2005|p=52}}

Barry Shank, writing in 1994 of [[Rock and roll]] in [[Austin, Texas]], used the word "subculture" to define the shifting meanings and membership of musical communities, or cultural spaces. 
Will Straw built on this work, replacing the term "subculture" by "scene".{{sfn|Wolf|2007|p=19}}
Straw saw a "scene" as relatively transient, while a music community is more stable. He wrote in 1991 that a music community engages in "an ongoing exploration of one or more musical idioms said to be rooted within a geographically specific historical heritage."{{sfn|Laughey|2006|p=100}}
Disputing Straw's characterization, later writers have pointed  out that music communities may be mobile and transient.{{sfn|Denzin|2010|p=75}}

Musical communities typically have very flexible structures, voluntary membership and people of a wide range of ages.{{sfn|Colwell|Richardson|2002|p=731}}
They offer participants the opportunity to play different roles including creator, participant or observer. Conscious efforts may be made to involve disadvantaged members. 
Typically the group encourages diversity, and all members are committed to lifetime learning.{{sfn|Colwell|Richardson|2002|p=731}}
When a music community is widespread, aspects of music-making such as repertoire and style may evolve and diverge.{{sfn|Brinner|1995|p=75}}

==Types of music community==

There are many types of music community.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
Women's music communities among the Ewe people of Ghana help create bonds and nurture cooperation between women who would otherwise be pulled apart by competition in their polygamist society.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=23}}
Irish immigrants to the United States were generally keen to assimilate and adopt a new ethnic identity as Americans, but a minority held onto their traditional culture and formed [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]] communities in [[Boston]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]] and other cities.{{sfn|Nicholsen|2007|p=3}}
After over one hundred years these communities persisted. The primary reason seems to have simply been the entertainment value.{{sfn|Nicholsen|2007|p=268}}
Teachers may deliberately foster development of a music community within their school, which can assist students in reaching their full potential.{{sfn|Froehlich|2004|p=4}}
Such teachers may build on the [[Suzuki method]] in the belief that cooperation in group classes plays an important role, and that competition is inappropriate.{{sfn|Froehlich|2004|p=6}}
According to Mary Ann Froehlich, "Competition isolates, while cooperation creates community. ... Our goal is to build an inclusive music community."{{sfn|Froehlich|2004|p=7}}

==Online music communities==

One of the early online music communities was established in 1996 by [[Oh Boy Records]], a small independent record company. It took the form of a chat page on its website that let fans of [[John Prine]] exchange views and information. The website became the base of a specialized Prine music community.{{sfn|Kibby|2006|p=295}}
However, as Prine ceased performing while fighting cancer, and no new recordings were released, the community ran out of information to exchange and went into decline.{{sfn|Kibby|2006|p=299}}
Oh Boy eventually closed the chat page.{{sfn|Kibby|2006|p=301}}
Another early online music community that was the subject of an ethnographic study was the Banjo Hangout, established in 2000.
As of 2011 it had about 51,000 members and featured a large online learning center.{{sfn|Waldron|2011|p=32}}
[[imeem]], a social networking site with 28 million monthly visitors, was the first music community to provide ad-supported free online music streaming and downloading. 
Other sites such as [[Myspace]] followed with similar services.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=116}}
Specialized software has been developed to support online music communities.{{sfn|Creative Commons Music Communities}}

[[Online communities]] have emerged for genres of folk music such as [[Bluegrass music|Blue Grass]] and [[Old-time music|Old Time]]. [[Cyber-ethnography]] using the framework of [[Étienne Wenger]]'s [[social learning theory]] shows that sites like this may be considered a [[community of practice]] (CoP).{{sfn|Waldron|2009|p=97}}
The members of an online music community can publish, listen to and evaluate the music they have created, giving them a strong sense of membership. It provides a platform within which members can create a musical identity as well as one in which they can build social bonds.{{sfn|Veblen|Elliott|Messenger|Silverman|2013|p=51}}
J. P. Williams, writing in 2006 in the ''[[Journal of Contemporary Ethnography]]'', argued that the driving force behind online music communities is the interest of the participants in building their identities, despite the ostensible focus on making and sharing music.{{sfn|Rikandi|2010|p=199, 205}}

A 2013 book notes that in Finland the ''Mikseri'' music portal, with about 140,000 registered users, helps people create, share and discuss their music in this sparsely-populated country.
This web-based community was the object of ethnographic studies in 2008 and 2009 based on theories of sociocultural learning.{{sfn|Veblen|Elliott|Messenger|Silverman|2013|p=50}}
Members of Mikseri do not exclusively belong to that community, but may belong to other real-world or online communities.{{sfn|Veblen|Elliott|Messenger|Silverman|2013|p=51}}
An analysis of event-related data from an online music community shows that events on that site often cause increased interest in a given artist, but propagation over links within digital social communities is also an important factor.{{sfn|Tirado|Higuero|Isaila|Carretero|2011}}
An investigation of the music community of fans of Swedish [[indie music]] showed that they do not gather around one site, but interact with a network of sites including their own fan sites, Myspace, [[Last.fm]], [[YouTube]] and so on.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=143}}

Online discussion forums may provide some of the functions of virtual music communities.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=123}}
However, according to Mary McCarthy a music community should teach uninitiated listeners or musicians, and an online group cannot fill this role.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=123}}
Only a community of real people in a real place can provide the depth of contact, discussion, sharing and support that the novice musician requires for their development.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=124}}

==Community Music Therapy==

Music Therapy is the use of musical instruments, the audio of already made music or the task of improvisational music to either relieve a symptom that involves speech or memory, but one of the newest uses of music therapy using Community music has been in prisons this has helped rehabilitate prisoners mentally of their criminal struggles as well as their mental struggles with anxiety and depression as studied by Dr Christian Gold.

The main idea behind neurocriminology is that crime is only partially a social and environmental problem, and biological factors along with medical conditions play a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|page=217 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deviant brain theories have always been part of biocriminology, which explains crime with biological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|pages=19–121 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurocriminology has become mainstream during the past two decades,&lt;ref name="Raine, Adrian 2014 367"&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|page=367|publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; since contemporary biocriminologists focus almost exclusively on brain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|page=241 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to significant advances in neuroscience. Even though neurocriminology is still at odds with traditional sociological theories of crime,&lt;ref name="Raine, Adrian 2014 367"/&gt; it is becoming more popular in the scientific community.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530"&gt;{{cite web |last=Raine |first=Adrian |title=The Criminal Mind |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The origins of neurocriminology go back to one of the founders of modern criminology, 19th-century Italian psychiatrist and prison doctor Cesare Lombroso, whose beliefs that the crime originated from brain abnormalities were partly based on phrenological theories about the shape and size of the human head. Lombroso conducted a postmortem on a serial killer and rapist, who had an unusual indentation at the base of the skull. Lombroso discovered a hollow part in the killer’s brain where the cerebellum would be. Lombroso’s theory was that crime originated in part from abnormal brain physiology and that violent criminals where throwbacks to less evolved human types identifiable by ape-like physical characteristics. Criminals, he believed, could be identified by physical traits, such as a large jaw and sloping forehead.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt; The contemporary neuroscientists further developed his idea that physiology and traits of the brain underlie all crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Tim |title=How to Spot a Murderer's Brain |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/may/12/how-to-spot-a-murderers-brain}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term “neurocriminology” was first introduced by James Hilborn (Cognitive Centre of Canada) and adopted by the leading researcher in the field, Dr. Adrian Raine, the chair of the Criminology Department at University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Seligman |first=Marty |title=Three Scholars Worth Your Time: Part 4 |url=http://lawmindscience.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/three-interesting-mind-scientists/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to conduct brain imaging study on violent criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Criminologist Believes Violent Behavior Is Biological, Adrian Raine's Interview with NPR Fresh Air's Terry Gross |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/03/21/292375166/criminologist-believes-violent-behavior-is-biological}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major studies ==

Many recent studies have revealed that sometimes structural and functional abnormalities are so striking that anyone can see them. Some violent offenders, however, have subtle structural or functional abnormalities and even highly experienced neuroradiologists cannot detect these irregularities right away. Yet, the abnormalities can be detected using brain imaging and state-of-the-art analytic tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|page=136 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurophysiological studies ==

Studies on structural deficiencies suggest that people consistently behaving antisocially have structurally impaired brains. The abnormalities can be either of general character or affect specific regions of the brain that control emotions, aggression or are responsible for ethical decisions:

''Low number of neurons in the prefrontal cortex''.
A study in 2000 determined that people with a history of persistent antisocial behavior had an 11 percent reduction in the volume of gray matter in the prefrontal cortex, while white matter volume was normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reduced prefrontal gray matter volume and reduced autonomic activity in antisocial personality disorder |author=Raine, A., Lencz, T., Bihrle, S., Lacasse, L. &amp; Colletti, P.|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|year=2000 |volume=57 |pages=119–27 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.57.2.119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, A 2009 meta-analysis study, which pooled together the findings of 12 anatomical brain-imaging studies conducted on offender populations, found that the prefrontal cortex of the brain is indeed structurally impaired in offenders.&lt;ref name="j.pscychresns.2009.03.012"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Prefrontal structural and functional brain imaging findings in antisocial, violent, and psychopathic individuals: A meta-analysis |author1=Yang, Y.  |author2=Raine, A. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging |year=2009 |volume=174 |pages=81–88 |doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2009.03.012 |pmid=19833485 |pmc=2784035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Underdeveloped amygdalae''. Two studies found that both the left and especially the right amygdalae are impaired in psychopaths. The psychopaths had on average 18 percent reduction in the volume of the right amygdala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Localization of deformations within the amygdala in individuals with psychopathy |author=Yang, Y., Raine, A., Karr, K. L., Colletti, P. &amp; Toga, A.|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |year=2009 |volume=66 |pages=986–94 |doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.110 |pmid=19736355 |pmc=3192811}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Lower Amygdala Volume in Men is Associated with Childhood Aggression, Early Psychopathic Traits, and Future Violence |author=Pardini, Dustin A.|journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=75 |pages=73–80 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.04.003|display-authors=etal |pmid=23647988 |pmc=3751993 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cavum septi pellucidi maldevelopment''. A study in 2010 suggested that people with [[Cave of septum pellucidum|cavum septi pellucidi]] were prone to psychopathy, antisocial personality disorder, and had more charges and convictions for criminal offenses. This brain maldevelopment was especially linked to lifelong antisocial behavior, i.e. a reckless disregarded for self and others, lack of remorse, and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Presence of a neurodevelopmental marker for limbic maldevelopment in antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy |author=Raine, A., Lee, L., Yang, Y. &amp; Colletti, P. |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |year=2010 |volume=197 |pages=186–92 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.110.078485 |pmid=20807962 |pmc=2930915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bigger right hippocampus''. A 2004 study suggested that the psychopaths’ right hippocampus that partially controls emotions and regulates aggression was significantly bigger than the left. This asymmetry was also true in normal people, but it was much more noticeable in psychopaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hippocampal structural asymmetry in unsuccessful psychopaths |author=Raine, A., Ishikawa, S. S., Arce, E., Lencz, T., Knuth, K. H.|journal=Biological Psychiatry |year=2004 |volume=55 |pages=185–91 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(03)00727-3|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Increase in the volume of the striatum''. A study in 2010 found that psychopathic individuals showed a 10 percent increase in the volume of the striatum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Increased volume of the striatum in psychopathic individuals |author=Glenn, A. L., Raine, A., Yaralian, P. S. &amp; Yang, Y. |journal=Biological Psychiatry |year=2010 |volume=67 |pages=52–58 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.06.018|pmc=2794920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Damage by foreign objects''. A large number of studies on structural damage by foreign objects convincingly shows that adults suffering head injuries damaging the prefrontal cortex show impulsive and antisocial behavior that does not conform to the norms of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Glenn, A. L.  |author2=Raine, A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Neural circuits underlying morality and antisocial behavior, in The Moral Brain |year=2009 |pages=45–68 |publisher=New York: Springer, J. Verplaetse and J. Braeckman (eds.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a number of famous life stories showing the same causal connection. For example, P. Gage was a well-respected, well-liked, and responsible gentleman. In 1848 because of a construction accident he suffered a serious damage to his brain when a metal rod propelled by an explosive entered his lower left cheek and exited from the top-middle part of his head. Gage healed quickly. After that accident, however, he became erratic, disrespectful, and vulgar. Gage had been transformed from a well-controlled, well-respected person to an individual with psychopathic traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|pages=143–45 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Damage by tumors''. There is also a number of famous U.S. criminal cases showing that damage of the brain by tumors can result in the same transformation as the damage by foreign objects. 
Charles Whitman, for instance, was a young man who studied architectural engineering at the University of Texas. Whitman had no history of violence or crime. As a child, he scored 138 on the Stanford-Binet IQ test, placing in the 99th percentile. He was an Eagle Scout, volunteered as a scoutmaster, and served in Marine Corps. In 1966 Whitman unexpectedly killed his mother as well as wife, ascended the belltower of the University of Texas, Austin, and fired a rifle at students below. He killed 15 people and wounding 31 more before police officers shot him. Whitman in his final note complained of inability to control his thoughts and requested an autopsy, which revealed a brain tumor in the hypothalamus region of his brain, a growth that, some hypothesized, put pressure on his amygdala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|page=204 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eagleman |first=David |title=The Brain on Trial |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/308520/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Michael Oft’s was a teacher in Virginia who had no prior psychiatric nor deviant behavior history. At the age of forty, his behavior suddenly changed. He began to frequent massage parlors, collect child pornography, abuse his step-daughter, and was soon found guilty of child molestation. Mr. Oft opted for a treatment program for pedophiles, but still couldn’t resist soliciting sexual favors from staff and other clients at the rehabilitation center. A neurologist advised a brain scan, which showed a tumor growing at the base of his orbitofrontal cortex, compressing the right prefrontal region of his brain. After the tumor was removed, Mr. Oft’s emotion, behavior and sexual activity returned to normal. But after several months of normal behavior Mr. Oft again began to collect child pornography. Neurologists rescanned his brain and found that the tumor had grown back. After the second surgery removing the tumor, his behavior have been totally appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|page=303 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurofunctional studies ==

Similarly to neurophysiological studies neurofunctional showed that brains of criminals and psychopaths not only are structures differently but also operate in a different way. As you can see below, both structural and functional abnormalities tend to affect the same areas of the brain. These are the major abnormalities found:

''Lack of Activation in the Prefrontal Cortex''. A number of studies replicated the observance that violent criminals’ brains showed a significant reduction in prefrontal glucose metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brain abnormalities in murderers indicated by positron emission tomography |author=Raine, A., Buchsbaum, M. S. &amp; LaCasse, L. |journal=Biological Psychiatry |year=1997 |volume=42|pages=495–508 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(96)00362-9 |pmid=9285085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="j.pscychresns.2009.03.012" /&gt;

''Reduced Activity In The Amygdala''. A study found that individuals with high psychopathy scores showed reduced activity in the amygdala during emotional, personal moral decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The neural correlates of moral decision-making in psychopathy |author=Glenn, A. L., Raine, A. &amp; Schug, R. A. |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |year=2009|volume=14 |pages=5–6 |doi=10.1038/mp.2008.104}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
''Dysfunctional Posterior Cingulate''. Two studies found that posterior cingulate functions poorly in adult criminal psychopaths and aggressive patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Limbic abnormalities in affective processing by criminal psychopaths as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging |author=Kiehl, K. A., Smith, A. M., Hare, R. D., Mendrek, A., Forster, B. B., Brink, J. &amp; Liddle, P. F. |journal=Biological Psychiatry |year=2001 |volume=50 |pages=677–84 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(01)01222-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Blunted prefrontal cortical fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography response to meta-chlorophenylpiperazine in impulsive aggression |author=New, A.

''Reduced Cerebral Blood Flow in Angular Gyrus''. A couple of studies found reduced cerebral blood flow in angular gyrus of murderers and impulsive, violent criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reduced frontotemporal perfusion in psychopathic personality |author=Soderstrom, H., Hultin, L., Tullberg, M., Wikkelso, C., Ekholm, S.|journal=Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging |year=2002|volume=114 |pages=81–94 |doi=10.1016/s0925-4927(02)00006-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Neuroimaging studies of violence and antisocial behavior |author=Hoptman, M.

''Higher Activation of Subcortical Limbic Regions''. A 1998 study showed higher activation of subcortical limbic regions of two groups of reactive and proactive murderers, especially in the more “emotional” right hemisphere of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reduced prefrontal and increased subcortical brain functioning assessed using positron emission tomography in predatory and affective murderers |author=Raine, A., Meloy, J.

''Functional Disturbances of the Hippocampus and Its Parahippocampal Gyrus''. A number of studies suggest that this region of the brain is not working properly in murders and violent offenders in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Disorder-specific dissociation of orbitofrontal dysfunction in boys with pure conduct disorder during reward and ventrolateral prefrontal dysfunction in boys with pure ADHD during sustained attention |author=Rubia, K., Smith, A. B., Halari, R., Matsukura, F., Mohammad, M.|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |year=2009 |volume=166 |pages=83–94 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08020212|display-authors=etal |pmid=18829871}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reduced regional cerebral blood flow in non-psychotic violent offenders |author=Soderstrom, H., Tullberg, M., Wikkelso, C., Ekholm, S. &amp; Forsman, A. |journal=Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging |year=2000 |volume=98 |pages=29–41 |doi=10.1016/s0925-4927(99)00049-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free will ==

Unlike the founding father of criminology, Cesare Lombroso, who thought that crime was fundamentally biological in its origin and criminals lacked free will altogether, contemporary neurocriminologists seem to take the middle ground approach. They do not argue that biological factors alone cause behavioral problems, but recognize that behavior results from interaction between biology and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rafter, Nicole Hahn |title=The Criminal Brain: Understanding Biological Theories of Crime |year=2008|page=244 |publisher=New York University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|pages=306–15 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors, however, are more determinist in their views. As one author writes: ''"Free will may exist (it may simply be beyond our current science), but one thing seems clear: if free will does exist, it has little room in which to operate. It can at best be a small factor riding on top of vast neural networks shaped by genes and environment. In fact, free will may end up being so small that we eventually think about bad decision-making in the same way we think about any physical process, such as diabetes or lung disease."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eagleman |first=David |title=The Brain on Trial | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/308520/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal use ==

US legal defense teams increasingly use brain scans as mitigating evidence in trials of violent criminals and sex offenders. See [[Neurolaw]] for more. Here are some of the most famous cases:

===Herbert Weinstein===
In 1991, a sixty-five-year-old advertising executive with no prior history of crime or violence after an argument strangled his wife, opened the window and threw her out of their 12th-floor apartment. His defense team had a structural brain scan done using MRI and PET scan. The images showed a big piece missing from the prefrontal cortex of the brain, i.e., a subarachnoid cyst was growing in his left frontal lobe. The defense team used these images to argue that Weinstein had an impaired ability to regulate his emotions and make rational decisions. The team went with an insanity defense, and the prosecution and defense agreed to a plea of manslaughter. As a result, Weinstein was given a seven-year sentence in contrast to the twenty-five-year sentence he would have served if he had been convicted of second-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Jeffrey |title=The Brain on the Stand |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/magazine/11Neurolaw.t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antonio Bustamante===
Bustamante was a well-behaved teenager who suddenly at the age of 22 became a career criminal. His crimes included theft, breaking and entering, drug offenses, and robbery. In 1990 Bustamante was charged with a homicide. The defense team discovered that the client had suffered a head injury from a crowbar at the age of twenty. Bustamante’s behavior changed fundamentally after that, transforming him from a normal individual into an impulsive and emotionally labile criminal. The defense team had his client’s brain scanned, which revealed malfunctioning of the prefrontal cortex. At the end the jury believed that Bustamante’s brain was not normal and spared him from the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raine, Adrian |title=The Anatomy of Violence: the Biological Roots of Crime |year=2014|page=69 |publisher=Vintage Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donta Page===
In 1999, Page robbed, raped and killed a female student in Denver. He later was found guilty of first-degree murder and was a candidate for the death penalty. Professor A. Raine from the University of Pennsylvania was an expert witness for defense and brought Page into a laboratory to assess his brain function. Brain imaging scans revealed a distinct lack of activation in the ventral prefrontal cortex. Professor Raine argued for a deep-rooted biological explanation for Mr. Page’s violence, who escaped death penalty partly on the basis of his brain pathology.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt;

== Crime prevention ==

Even though currently there are no preventive programs in place utilizing the recent discoveries in neurocriminology, there are a number of offender rehabilitation programs (Cognitive Centre of Canada).

===Decisions based on brain imaging===
Some scientists propose using brain imaging to help decide which soon-to-be-released offenders are at greater risk for reoffending. The brain imaging data would be used along with common factors like age, prior arrests, and marital status.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt; To support this idea, in a 2013 study, Professor Kent Kiehl from the University of New Mexico studying the population of 96 male offenders in the state’s prisons found that offenders with low activity in the anterior cingulate cortex where twice as likely to commit an offense in the four years after their release as those who had high activity in this region.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt; Similarly, Dustin Pardini conducted that which shows that men with a smaller amygdala are three times more likely to commit violence three years after their release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Lower Amygdala Volume in Men is Associated with Childhood Aggression, Early Psychopathic Traits, and Future Violence|author=Pardini, Dustin A.|journal=Biological Psychiatry |year=2013|volume=75 |pages=73–80 |issue=1 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.04.003|display-authors=etal |pmid=23647988 |pmc=3751993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurochemistry===
Trials demonstrated the efficacy of a number of medications, i.e. stimulants antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood stabilizers, in diminishing aggression in adolescents and children.&lt;ref name="SB10001424127887323335404578444682892520530" /&gt;
Even a simple omega-3 supplements in the diets of young offenders reduces offending and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effects of nutritional supplements on aggression, rule-breaking, and psychopathology among young adult prisoners |author=Zaalberg, A., Nijman, H., Bulten, E., Stroosma, L. &amp; Van der Staak, C. |journal=Aggressive Behavior |year=2010 |volume=36 |pages=117–26 |doi=10.1002/ab.20335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cognitive and physiological effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in healthy subjects |author=Fontani, G., Corradeschi, F., Felici, A., Alfatti, F., Migliorini, S.|journal=European Journal of Clinical Investigation |year=2005 |volume=35 |pages=691–99 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2362.2005.01570.x |pmid=16269019|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditation===
Meditation can also affect brains, and even change them permanently. In 2003 Professor Richie Davidson from the University of Wisconsin performed a revolutionary study. People were randomly selected into either a mindfulness training group or a control group that was put on a waiting list for training. Davidson showed that even eight weekly sessions of meditation enhanced left frontal EEG functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Alterations in brain and immune function produced by mindfulness meditation |author=Davidson, R. J., Kabat-Zinn, J., Schumacher, J., Rosenkranz, M., Muller, D.|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine |year=2003 |volume=65 |pages=564–70|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar study was later replicated by Professor Holzel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mindfulness practice leads to increases in regional brain gray matter density |author=Holzel, B.

'''New Chronology''' is an alternative [[chronology of the ancient Near East]] developed by English Egyptologist [[David Rohl]] and other researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Rohl|title=The Lost Testament|year=2002|location= UK|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=David |last=Rohl|title= From Eden to Exile | year=2009|page= 2|ref=harv|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with ''A Test of Time: The Bible - from Myth to History'' in 1995. It contradicts mainstream [[Egyptology]] by proposing a major revision of the established [[Egyptian chronology]], in particular by re-dating Egyptian kings of the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth]] through [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth]] Dynasties, bringing forward conventional dating by up to 350 years. Rohl asserts that the New Chronology allows him to identify some of the characters in the [[Hebrew Bible]] with people whose names appear in archaeological finds.

The New Chronology, one of several proposed radical revisions of the conventional chronology, has not been accepted in academic Egyptology, where the conventional chronology or small variations of it remain standard.&lt;ref name="biblearchaeology.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bennett|first= Chris|title=Temporal Fugues |journal=Journal of Ancient and Medieval Studies|volume=XIII |year=1996|url= http://www.biblearchaeology.org/file.axd?file=temporalfugues.rtf|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amélie Kuhrt]], head of Ancient Near Eastern History at [[University College London]], in one of the standard reference works of the discipline, notes, {{quote|Many scholars feel sympathetic to the critique of weaknesses in the existing chronological framework [...], but most archaeologists and ancient historians are not at present convinced that the radical redatings proposed stand up to close examination.&lt;ref name=Kuhrt&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhrt|first=Amelie|authorlink=Amélie Kuhrt|title=The Ancient Near East c. 3000-330 BC|volume=I |series=Routledge History of the Ancient World series|location=London &amp; New York|year=1995|page= 14|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}
Rohl's most vocal critic has been [[Kenneth Kitchen]], one of the leading experts on biblical history and the author of the standard work on the conventional chronology of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]], the period most directly affected by the New Chronology's redating of the Nineteenth to Twenty-fifth Dynasties.

== Rohl's New Chronology ==
[[File:NC Egyptian chronology comparison.png|thumb|Chart comparing the New Chronology of [[David Rohl]] and the [[Egyptian chronology#Conventional chronology|conventional chronology]] of [[Ian Shaw (Egyptologist)|Ian Shaw]]]]

David Rohl's published works ''A Test of Time'' (1995), ''Legend'' (1998), ''The Lost Testament'' (2002), and ''The Lords of Avaris'' (2007) set forth Rohl's theories for re-dating the major civilisations of the ancient world. ''A Test of Time'' proposes a down-dating (bringing closer to the present), by several centuries, of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], thus needing a major revision of the [[conventional chronology of ancient Egypt]]. Rohl asserts that this would let scholars identify some of the major events in the Hebrew Bible with events in the archaeological record and identify some of the well-known biblical characters with historical figures who appear in contemporary ancient texts. Lowering the Egyptian dates also dramatically affects the dating of dependent chronologies, such as that currently used for the [[Greek Heroic Age]] of the [[Late Bronze Age]], removing the [[Greek Dark Ages]], and lowering the dates of the [[Trojan War]] to within two generations of a ninth-century-BC [[Homer]] and his most famous composition: the ''[[Iliad]]''.

Rejecting the Revised Chronology of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] and the [[Glasgow Chronology]] presented at the Society for Interdisciplinary Studies's 1978 "Ages in Chaos" conference, the New Chronology lowers the Egyptian dates (established within the traditional chronology) by up to 350 years at points before the universally accepted fixed date of 664 BC for the sacking of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] by [[Ashurbanipal]].

Before the 1995 publication of ''A Test of Time'', [[Thomas L. Thompson]], a [[theology|theologian]] associated with [[Biblical Minimalism]], had insisted that any attempt to write history based on a direct integration of biblical and extra-biblical sources was "not only dubious but wholly ludicrous".&lt;ref name="st131002"/&gt; Rohl explained his view on the issue in ''The Lost Testament'' (2007): "Is the Old Testament history or myth? The only way to answer that question is to investigate the biblical stories using the archaeological evidence, combined with a study of the ancient texts of the civilisations which had a role to play in the Bible story. But this has to be done with an open mind. In my view the biblical text – just like any other ancient document – should be treated as a potentially reliable historical source until it can be demonstrated to be otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Rohl had previously remarked in ''A Test of Time'' (1995) that he "did not originally set out to challenge our current understanding of the Old Testament narratives. This has come about simply because of the need to explore the ramifications of my TIP [Egyptian Third Intermediate Period] research. I have no religious axe to grind – I am simply an historian in search of some historical truth."&lt;ref&gt;''A Test of Time'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohl's redating is based on criticism of three of the four arguments which he considers are the original foundations of the conventional chronology for the Egyptian New Kingdom:
* He asserts that the identification of "[[Shishak|Shishaq]] [Shishak], King of Egypt" ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 14:25f; [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 12:2-9) with [[Shoshenq I]], first proposed by [[Jean-François Champollion]], is based on incorrect conclusions. Rohl argues instead that Shishaq should be identified with [[Ramesses II]] (probably pronounced Riamashisha), which would move the date of Ramesses' reign forward some 300 years.
* Rohl also asserts that the record in the [[Ebers Papyrus]] of the [[Sothic cycle|rising of Sirius]] in the ninth [[regnal year]] of [[Amenhotep I]], which is used in conventional chronology to fix that year to either 1542 BC or 1517 BC, has been misread, and instead should be understood as evidence for a reform in the Egyptian calendar. This negative view of Papyrus Ebers is exemplified in a statement by Professor Jürgen von Beckerath who is of the opinion that "The calendar on the verso of the Ebers Medical Papyrus is by now so disputed that we must ask ourselves whether we really possess a sure basis for the chronology of this period of Egyptian history which is, after all, of the greatest importance for fixing the sequence of historical events, as well as for neighbouring countries".&lt;ref&gt;Becherath, J. von, in Helk, W. (ed.) Abstracts for the 'High, Middle or Low? International Colloquium on Chronology held at [[Schloss Haindorf]] (1990), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Wolfgang Helck concludes that "We therefore think it is safer to start from the regnal dates rather than from interpretations of real or supposed Sirius (Sothic) or New Moon dates".&lt;ref&gt;Helck, W. in Helk, W. (ed.) Abstracts for the 'High, Middle or Low? International Colloquium on Chronology held at Schloss Haindorf (1990), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;
* Papyrus Leiden I.350, which dates to the 52nd year of Ramesses II, records a lunar observation which places that year of Ramesses's reign in one of 1278, 1253, 1228 or 1203 BC within the date-range of the conventional chronology. Having questioned the value of the Ebers Papyrus, Rohl argues that, since the lunar cycle repeats itself every 25 years, it is only useful for fine tuning a chronology and could equally apply to dates 300 years later as in the New Chronology.

Thus, Rohl is of the opinion that none of these three foundations of the conventional Egyptian chronology are secure, and that the sacking of Thebes by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal in 664 BC is the earliest fixed date in Egyptian history.

===Evidence adduced===
Rohl bases his revised chronology (the New Chronology) on his interpretation of numerous archeological finds and genealogical records from Egypt. For example:

* Rohl notes that no [[Apis (deity)|Apis]] bull burials are recorded in the Lesser Vaults at [[Saqqara]] for the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first]] and early [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second]] Dynasties. He also argues that the reburial sequence of the mummies of the New Kingdom pharaohs in the Royal Cache (TT 320) shows that these two dynasties were contemporary (thus explaining why there are too few Apis burials for the period). Rohl finds that in the royal burial ground at Tanis it appears that the tomb of [[Osorkon II]] of the 22nd Dynasty was built before that of [[Psusennes I]] of the 21st Dynasty; in Rohl's view this can only be explained if the two dynasties were contemporary.
* Rohl offers inscriptions that list three non-royal genealogies which, when one attributes 20 to 23 years to a generation, show, according to Rohl, that Ramesses II flourished in the 10th century BC as Rohl advocates. In the conventional chronology, all three genealogies would be missing seven generations. He also argues that there are no genealogies that confirm the conventional dates for Ramesses II in the 13th century BC.
* One of Rohl's methods is the use of [[archaeoastronomy]], which he employs to fix the date of a near-sunset solar [[eclipse]] during the reign of [[Akhenaten]] and observed from the city of [[Ugarit]]. Based on calculations, using computer astronomy programs, Rohl asserts that the only time when this eclipse could have occurred during the whole second millennium BC was on 9 May 1012 BC. This is approximately 350 years later than the conventional dates for Akhenaten (1353-1334 BC).
* Rohl's dates for Amenemhat III of the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] in the 17th century BC have found support in the work of astronomer David Lappin, whose research finds matches for a sequence of 37 out of 39 lunar month lengths recorded in 12th Dynasty contracts; the conventional chronology matches at best 21. According to Lappin, this pattern provides "startling" support for Rohl's chronology.&lt;ref name=st131002&gt;''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 13 October 2002, [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/article54642.ece How myth became history]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shishaq===
[[File:Sysw-&amp;-Shyshk.jpg|thumb|Comparison by David Rohl of (first line) the name ''Sysw'' (the [[hypocorism]] of Ramesses II) as it would have been written using 13th to 10th century Proto-Hebrew signs, and (second line) the biblical name Shyshk as it would have been written using ninth to seventh-century Early Hebrew signs. The signs are taken from pottery inscriptions dating to those periods (namely the Lachish VI ostracon and the Izbet Sartah abcedary).]]

Most Egyptologists accept Shishaq as an alternative name for Shoshenq I.&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Paul S. ''David, Solomon and Egypt'' Continuum International Publishing Group - Sheffie (1 Nov 1999) {{ISBN|978-1-84127-021-0}} pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael David ''The Oxford History of the Biblical World'' Oxford Paperbacks; New edition (26 Jul 2001) {{ISBN|978-0-19-513937-2}} p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Kevin A ''The Campaign of Pharaoh Shoshenq I into Palestine'' Mohr Siebeck 2005 {{ISBN|978-3-16-148270-0}} p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Rohl disputes that Shoshenq's military activity fits the biblical account of Shishaq on the grounds that the two kings' campaigns are completely different and Jerusalem does not appear in the Shoshenq inscription as a subjected town.&lt;ref&gt;''A Test of Time'', pp. 122-27.&lt;/ref&gt; He also points out that Ramesses did campaign against Israel and that he had a short form of his formal name which was in use in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', pp. 389-96.&lt;/ref&gt; That name was Sysw, whilst the early Hebrew alphabet did not distinguish between S and SH, so the biblical name may have originally been Sysq. Rohl has also argued that the qoph ending may be a later misreading of the early sign for waw which in the tenth century was identical to the seventh century sign for qoph. Thus 7th century Sysq may have been a mistaken later reading of tenth-century Sysw.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Rohl]], [http://thelegendgroup.msatt.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=90 Shoshenq, Shishak and Shysha], accessed 7 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory that Ramesses II (hypocoristicon ''Sysa''), rather than Shoshenq I, should be identified with the biblical Shishak is not widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grisanti |first1= Michael A |first2= Davd M. |last2=Howard |title=Giving the Sense |publisher= Kregel Academic &amp; Professional |date=1 April 2004 |isbn= 978-0-8254-2892-0 |page=193 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stMd0QV97IYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=Shishak+and+Sysw+David+Rohl&amp;num=100&amp;ei=KOd1SvaKKI_-ygTSzuz-Ag&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kevin Wilson agrees only partially with David Rohl. Wilson accepts that there is a mismatch between the triumphal relief of Shoshenq I and the biblical description of King Shishak. However, he does not think that this discrepancy gives sufficient reason for doubting the identification of Shoshenq I with King Shishak of the Bible. Wilson writes about Shoshenq's inscription, "Contrary to previous studies, which have interpreted the relief as a celebration of his Palestine campaign, neither the triumphal relief nor any of its elements can be utilized as a source for historical data about that campaign. … the triumphal relief can unfortunately play no role in the reconstruction of Shoshenq’s campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Wilson |first1= Kevin A. |title= The Campaign of Pharaoh Shoshenq I into Palestine|year= 2005|publisher= Mohr Siebeck|isbn= 3-16-148270-0|page= 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wilson's view is not supported by Kenneth Kitchen who states: "That the great topographical list of Shoshenq I at Karnak is a document of the greatest possible value for the history and nature of his campaign against Judah and Israel is now clearly established beyond all dispute, thanks to the labours expended on that list by a series of scholars. However, the composition and interpretation of the list still require further examination and clarification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kitchen |first1= Kenneth A.|authorlink=Kenneth Kitchen |title= The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt|year= 1973|publisher=Aris &amp; Phillips|isbn= 9780856680014|page= 432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other leading scholars who have studied the campaign relief point out that it is indeed a unique list of subjected towns and not a copy of an earlier campaign by a more celebrated pharaoh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Noth |first1= M. |title= ZDPV 61|year= 1938|pages= 277–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Albright |first1= W.

==Implications of the New Chronology==

The implications of a radical down-dating of the conventional Egyptian chronology, such as that proposed by Rohl and other revisionists, are complex and wide-ranging. The New Chronology affects the historical disciplines of Old Testament studies, Levantine archaeology, Aegean and Anatolian archaeology and Classical studies, and raises major issues concerning Mesopotamian chronology and its links with Egypt and Anatolia.

===Implications for Egypt and her neighbours===

Redating the reign of Ramesses II to three centuries later than that given by the conventional chronology would reposition the date of the [[Battle of Kadesh]] and revise the linked chronology of Hittite history, and would need a revision of the chronology of Assyrian history before 911 BC. Given the dependence of Hittite chronology on Egyptian chronology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical dictionary of the Hittites |last=Burney |first=Charles Allen |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8108-6564-8 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74IJytg2XuUC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Hittite+chronology+Egyptian#v=onepage&amp;q=Hittite%20chronology%20Egyptian&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; a lowering of Egyptian dates would result in a lowering of the end of the [[Hittite New Kingdom]] and a resulting reduction (or complete removal) of the Anatolian Dark Age.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lords of Avaris'', Chapter 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Amarna period, a [[chronological synchronism]] between Egypt and Assyria is attested through the correspondence of Pharaoh Akhenaten and a King Ashuruballit. In the conventional chronology, this Ashuruballit is identified with [[Ashur-uballit I]] of the early [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], but the New Chronology has proposed the addition of an otherwise unknown King Ashuruballit "II" during the Middle Assyrian "dark age" as the author of the [[Amarna letters]]. Given that the Ashuruballit I synchronism with Akhenaten has become the crucial link between Egyptian and Mesopotamian history in recent years, this issue is a key area of focus and dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, Preface to the 2nd edition of ''TIPE''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for the Bible===

As explained above, the New Chronology rejects the identification of Shoshenq I with the biblical Shishaq,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newchronology.org/cgi-bin/somsid.cgi?session=1251460988&amp;page=html/volumes/06|title=ISIS - Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum|work=newchronology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead offers Ramesses II (also known by his nickname "Sysa") as the real historical figure behind the Shishaq narrative.

Rohl identifies [[Labaya]], a local ruler in Canaan whose activities are documented in the Amarna Letters, with [[Saul]], and identifies [[David]] with Dadua ("Tadua"), also mentioned in Amarna Letter EA256. Saul and Labaya share the same demise - "both die in battle - against a coalition of city states from the coastal plain - on or near [[Mount Gilboa]], both as a result of betrayal."&lt;ref name=st131002/&gt; Both also have a surviving son whose name translates as "Man of Baal."

The New Chronology places [[Solomon]] at the end of the wealthy Late Bronze Age rather than in the relatively impoverished Early Iron Age. Rohl and other New Chronology researchers contend that this fits better with the Hebrew Bible's description of Solomon's wealth.&lt;ref name=st131002/&gt;

Furthermore, Rohl shifts the Israelite Sojourn, Exodus and Conquest from the end of the Late Bronze Age to the latter part of the Middle Bronze Age (from the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] to the Thirteenth/Hyksos period). Rohl claims that this solves many of the problems associated with the historicity issue of the biblical narratives. He makes use of the archaeological reports from [[Avaris]], in the eastern [[Nile Delta]], which show that a large Semitic-speaking population lived there during the Thirteenth Dynasty. These people were culturally similar to the population of Middle Bronze Age (MB IIA) Canaan. Rohl identifies these Semites as the people upon whom the biblical tradition of the Israelite Sojourn in Egypt was subsequently based.

Towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (late MB IIB) archaeologists have revealed a series of city destructions which John Bimson and Rohl have argued correspond closely to the cities attacked by the Israelite tribes in the Joshua narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newchronology.org/cgi-bin/somsid.cgi?session=1251460988&amp;page=html/volumes/02|title=ISIS - Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum|work=newchronology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohl ''A Test of Time'', Chapter 14, pp. 299-325&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly, the heavily fortified city of Jericho was destroyed and abandoned at this time. On the other hand, there was no city of Jericho in existence at the end of the Late Bronze Age, drawing William Dever to conclude that "Joshua destroyed a city that wasn’t even there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dever|first1=William G.|title=Recent Archeological Discoveries and Biblical Research|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ab7_GFJ-dKQC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=Dever+Joshua+destroyed+even+there&amp;hl=en|accessdate=2013-01-07|year=1990|origyear=1989|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=USA|isbn=0-295-97261-0|page=47|chapter=2. The Israelite Settlement in Canaan. New Archeological Models|quote=(Of course, for some, that only made the Biblical story more miraculous than ever&amp;mdash;Joshua destroyed a city that wasn't even there!)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rohl claims that it is this lack of archaeological evidence to confirm biblical events in the Late Bronze Age which lies behind modern scholarly skepticism over the reliability of the Hebrew Bible narratives before the Divided Monarchy period. He gives the example of Israeli professor of archaeology, [[Ze'ev Herzog]], who caused an uproar in Israel and abroad when he gave voice to the "fairly widespread" view held among his colleagues that "there had been no Exodus from Egypt, no invasion by Joshua and that the Israelites had developed slowly and were originally Canaanites,"&lt;ref name="Sturgis"&gt;M. Sturgis, ''It Ain’t Necessarily So: Investigating the Truth of the Biblical Past'' (Headlin, London, 2001), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that the Sojourn, Exodus and Conquest was “a history that never happened.”&lt;ref name="Sturgis" /&gt; However, Rohl contends that the New Chronology, with the shift of the Exodus and Conquest events to the Middle Bronze Age, removes the principal reason for that widespread academic skepticism.

==Identifications in the New Chronology==

===Personal identifications===

Rohl identifies:
*[[Nebkaure Khety]] IV (16th Pharaoh of the 10th Dynasty) with the Pharaoh who had dealings with [[Abraham]].
*[[Amraphel]] (Genesis 14) with [[Amar-Sin]], king of [[Sumer]] (1834-1825 BC/BCE by Rohl's chronology).
*[[Tidal (Bible)]], King of Goyim/King of Nations (Genesis 14), with [[Tishdal]], [[Hurrian]] ruler from the [[Zagros]] mountains.
*Zariku, governor of [[Ashur]], with king [[Arioch]] of [[Ellasar]].
*Kutir-Lagamar of [[Elam]] with [[Chedorlaomer]] of Elam.
*[[Amenemhat III]] with the Pharaoh of Joseph, and [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] with the [[Vizier]] of Amenemhat III.
* The "new king who did not know Joseph" in Exodus 1:8 is identified by Rohl with [[Sobekhotep III]].{{Request quotation|date=September 2017}}
*[[Neferhotep I]] with the adoptive grandfather of [[Moses]].
*[[Sobekhotep IV|Khanefere Sebekhotep IV]], brother and successor of Neferhotep, with Khenephres, the Pharaoh from whom Moses fled to [[Midian]].
*The [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]] with Manetho's Tutimaeus, whom Rohl identifies with [[Dedumose II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rohl|first1=David|title=An Alternative to the Velikovskian Chronology of Ancient Egypt|url=http://davidrohl.blogspot.co.uk/|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ibni]], [[Middle Bronze Age]] ruler of [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], with [[Jabin]], king of Hazor in Joshua 11:10.
*[[Akish]] or [[Achish]], king of Gath, is identified with [[Šuwardata]], King of [[Gath (city)|Gath]] in the Amarna letters. ''Akish'' is believed to be a shortened form of the [[Hurrian]] name ''Akishimige'', "the Sun God has given." Shuwardata is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] name meaning "the Sun God has given."
*[[Aziru]] of the Amarna Letters is identified with [[Hadadezer bar Rehob|Hadadezer]], Syrian king in II Samuel.
*[[Labaya]], a ruler in the [[Amarna Letters]], with [[King Saul]].
*[[King David]] with Dadua in Amarna Letter [[Amarna letter EA 256|EA 256]].
*[[Mutbaal]], writer of the letter, is identified with Ishbaal (aka [[Ishbosheth]]). The two names have exactly the same meaning: "Man of Baal." Following the death of his father (Labaya/Saul), Mutbaal/Ishbaal moved his center to [[Transjordan (Bible)|Transjordan]].
*"The Sons of Labaya," in the [[Amarna Letter EA 250|Amarna Letter 250]], with Mutbaal/Ishbaal and David/Dadua, the latter being the son-in-law of Labaya/Shaul.
*Benemina, also mentioned in [[Amarna letter EA 256|EA 256]], is identified by Rohl with Baanah, Israelite chieftain in II Samuel 4, who would later betray and assassinate Ishbosheth.
*Yishuya, also mentioned in [[Amarna letter EA 256|EA 256]], is identified with [[Jesse]] (''Ishai'' in Hebrew), father of David.
*Ayab, the subject of [[Amarna letter EA 256|EA 256]], is held to be the same as the Biblical [[Yoav]] (English "[[Joab]]").
*Lupakku ("Man of Pakku"), Aramean army commander in the Amarna Letters, with Shobach ("He of Pakku"{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}), Aramean army commander in the Bible.
*[[Nefertiti]] with [[Neferneferuaten]] and with [[Smenkhkare]].
*[[Horemheb]] is identified with the Pharaoh who destroyed [[Gezer]] and later gave it to [[Solomon]], together with one of his daughters as a wife. When Horemhab took Gezer he was not yet the ruler, but was acting under [[Tutankhamun]]. However, he became Pharaoh not long after, and Tutankhamun died too young to have left any marriageable daughters.
*[[Ramses II]] ([[hypocoristicon]] = Shysha) with [[Shishaq]] in the Bible.
*[[Chancellor Bay|Irsu the Syrian]], who took over control of Egypt according to the [[Harris Papyrus]], with Arza, Master of the Palace of Israel according to I Kings 16:8-10.
*[[Sheshi]], a [[Hyksos]] ruler, with [[Sheshai]], a ruler of [[Hebron]] descended from [[Anak]] (Joshua 15:13-15).
*Io of the Line of [[Inachus]] with Queen [[Ahhotep I|Ahhotep]] of the 17th Dynasty of Egypt at Waset
*[[Cadmus#Founder of Thebes|Cadmus of Thebes]] with Cadmus in the line of Pelasgian rulers of Crete
*[[Inachus]] with [[Khyan|Anak-idbu Khyan]] of the Greater Hyksos
*[[Apepi (pharaoh)|Auserre Apepi]] of the Greater Hyksos with [[Epaphus]]
*[[Cush (Bible)|Cush]], son of biblical [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] with [[Meskiagkasher]] of the First Dynasty of [[Uruk]]
*[[Nimrod]], son of biblical [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]] with [[Enmerkar]] ('Enmer the Hunter') of the First Dynasty of Uruk

===Geographical identifications===

Rohl, in addition to his chronology, also has some geographical ideas that are different from the conventional notions. These include:

*The [[Garden of Eden]] (the urheimat [homeland] of the Sumerians), according to Rohl, was located in what is now [[Tabriz#Early accounts|northwestern Iran]], between [[Lake Urmia]] and the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', pp. 16-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[The Tower of Babel]], according to Rohl, was built in the ancient Sumerian capital of [[Eridu]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament''&lt;/ref&gt;
*The site of the ancient city of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] is "a little over 100 metres beneath the surface of the [[Dead Sea]]," a few kilometers south-by-southeast from [[En-Gedi]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', pp. 120-124.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Amalekites]] defeated by [[King Saul]] were not the ones living in the [[Negev]] and/or the [[Sinai]], but a northern branch of this people, "in the territory of Ephraim, on the highlands of Amalek" - or, in an alternative translation "in the Land of Ephraim, the mountains of the Amalekites" (Judges 12:15). This is supported by the report that, immediately following his destruction of the Amalekites, "Saul went to Carmel and set up a monument" (I Samuel 15:12). Once Saul is removed from the Negev and the Sinai, "Saul's kingdom as described in the Bible is precisely the area ruled over by [[Labaya]] according to the el-Amarna letters."&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', p. 318)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===In Egyptology===
Most Egyptologists have not adopted the New Chronology,&lt;ref name="biblearchaeology.org" /&gt; continuing to employ the standard chronology in mainstream academic and popular publications. Rohl's most vocal critic has been Professor [[Kenneth Kitchen]], formerly of [[Liverpool University]], who called Rohl's thesis "100% nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Symbiosis, symbolism, and the power of the past: Canaan, ancient Israel, and their neighbors from the Late Bronze Age through Roman Palaestina |editor1-last=Dever |editor1-first=William G. |last=Kitchen |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |others=Seymour Gitin |chapter=Egyptian interventions in the Levant in Iron Age II |year=2003 |publisher=Eisenbrauns |location= |isbn=978-1-57506-081-1 |pages=113–132 [122] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KK3eFcbIGN0C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=Rohl+Kitchen#v=onepage&amp;q=Rohl%20Kitchen&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, other Egyptologists recognise the value of Rohl's work in challenging the bases of the Egyptian chronological framework. Professor Erik Hornung acknowledges that "...there remain many uncertainties in the Third Intermediate Period, as critics such as David Rohl have rightly maintained; even our basic premise of 925 [BC] for Shoshenq’s campaign to Jerusalem is not built on solid foundations."&lt;ref&gt;Hornung, E. et al.: "Ancient Egyptian Chronology" (Handbook of Oriental Studies I, vol. 83, Brill, Leiden, 2006), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Academic debate on the New Chronology, however, has largely not taken place in Egyptological or archaeological journals. Most discussions are to be found in the [[Institute for the Study of Interdisciplinary Sciences]]' ''Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum'' (1985–2006).&lt;ref&gt;ISIS archive, [http://www.newchronology.org Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum].&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Bennett (1996),&lt;ref name="biblearchaeology.org"/&gt; while saying "I am quite certain that Rohl’s views are wrong" notes that besides academic debate on problems with the conventional chronology, such as those associated with the [[Thera eruption]], a "far deeper challenge ... has been mounted in the public arena." The history of this challenge to mainstream consensus outside of academic debate originates with the 1991 ''Centuries of Darkness'' by [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]], together with Rohl, co-founder of the [[Institute for the Study of Interdisciplinary Sciences]]. ''Centuries of Darkness'' postulated 250 years of non-existent "phantom time" in the conventional chronology based on an archaeological "Dark Age".&lt;ref&gt;"In a special review issue of the ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal'' these proposals were roundly rejected by experts in all disciplines in Old World archaeology, a result virtually assured by the failure of the authors to present more than an outline restructuring for Egyptian chronology." Bennett (1996:2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Kitchen's arguments against the New Chronology have focused on Rohl's Third Intermediate Period revision which proposes an overlap between the 21st and 22nd Dynasties. In particular Kitchen challenges the validity of the chronological anomalies raised by Rohl, questioning whether they are true anomalies and offering his own explanations for the apparent problems raised by Rohl. Kitchen accuses New Chronologists of being obsessed with trying to close gaps in the archaeological record by lowering the dating.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Grouping all radical revisions of Egyptian chronology together without distinction, [[Erik Hornung]], in his Introduction to the ''Handbook of Ancient Egyptian Chronology'', makes the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We will always be exposed to such attempts, but they could only be taken seriously if not only the arbitrary dynasties and rulers, but also their contexts, could be displaced.... In the absence of such proofs we can hardly be expected to "refute" such claims, or even to respond in any fashion ... It is thus neither arrogance nor ill-will that leads the academic community to neglect these efforts which frequently lead to irritation and distrust outside of professional circles (and are often undertaken with the encouragement of the media). These attempts usually require a rather lofty disrespect of the most elementary sources and facts and thus do not merit discussion. We will therefore avoid discussion of such issues in our handbook, restricting ourselves to those hypotheses and discussions which are based on the sources.&lt;ref&gt;Hornung, E. et al.: "Ancient Egyptian Chronology" (Handbook of Oriental Studies I, vol. 83, Brill, Leiden, 2006), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bennett (1996), whilst not accepting Rohl's thesis, suggests that such out-of-hand rejection may be inappropriate in Rohl's case, since "there is a world of difference between [Rohl's] intellectual standing and that of Velikovsky, or even Peter James" since, unlike "popular radicalisms" such as those of [[Immanuel Velikovsky|Velikovsky]], [[Robert Bauval|Bauval]] or [[Graham Hancock|Hancock]], "Rohl has a considerable mastery of his material."

Professor [[Amélie Kuhrt]], head of Ancient Near Eastern History at University College, London, in one of the standard reference works of the discipline, states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An extreme low chronology has been proposed recently by a group devoted to revising the absolute chronology of the Mediterranean and Western Asia: P. James et al., ''Centuries of Darkness'', London, 1991; similar, though slightly diverging revisions, are upheld by another group, too, and partly published in the ''Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum''. The hub for the dating of other cultures is Egypt, so much of the work of both groups focuses on Egyptian evidence. Many scholars feel sympathetic to the critique of weaknesses in the existing chronological framework presented in these volumes, but most archaeologists and ancient historians are not at present convinced that the radical redatings proposed stand up to close examination.&lt;ref name=Kuhrt/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Radiocarbon dating===
In 2010 a series of corroborated [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] were published for dynastic Egypt which suggest some minor revisions to the conventional chronology, but do not support Rohl's proposed revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christopher Bronk Ramsey et al., |title=Radiocarbon-Based Chronology for Dynastic Egypt, |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5985/1554 |journal=''Science'' Vol. 328. no. 5985 (18 June 2010), pp. 1554 - 1557.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular media===
In 1995 Rohl published his version of the New Chronology, in the best-selling book ''A Test of Time'', accompanied by a 1995 Channel 4 three-part series ''Pharaohs and Kings - A Biblical Quest''. ''A Test of Time'' takes up the general scenario presented by James, adding many details omitted in 1991, including the "dramatic results" pertaining to [[Biblical chronology]]. Whilst the New Chronology has not been broadly accepted in academia, it has been widely disseminated to the public since the 1990s via Rohl's best-selling&lt;ref&gt;''A Test of Time'' stayed in the top ten ''[[Sunday Times]]'' bestseller list for eight weeks in 1995 (from 17 September to 6 November, pp. 7-14).&lt;/ref&gt; books and the 1995 [[Channel 4]] television documentary, aired in the United States in 1996 on [[The Learning Channel]]. Berthoud (2008) contrasts the "near-unanimous" rejection of Rohl's theories in Egyptology with the "sensational effect" his books, combined with the television series, had on the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Berthoud, J-M. ''Creation Bible Et Science'', 2008, {{ISBN|978-2-8251-3887-8}}, 244f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction of some leading figures from the academic establishment has been very hostile. Kenneth Kitchen presented a "savage review" of ''Centuries of Darkness'' in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', and the [[British Museum]] banned ''A Test of Time'' from its museum store.&lt;ref&gt;Alden Bass (2003), [http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2503 Which Came First, the Pyramids or the Flood?], ''Apologetics Press :: Reason &amp; Revelation'', November 2003 - 23[11]:97-101&lt;/ref&gt;

===By evangelicals===

In December 1999 the Dutch language internet journal ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'' (Bible, History and Archaeology) devoted space to a debate about Rohl's New Chronology. According to evangelical scholar, J.G. van der Land, editor of the journal, Rohl's time-line resolves some archaeological anomalies surrounding ancient Egypt, but creates conflicts with other areas that make it untenable.&lt;ref name=vanderland&gt;van der Land, J.G. (2000) "[http://www.bga.nl/en/discussion/echroroh.html Pharaohs and the Bible: David Rohl's chronology untenable]", ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'', December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; His arguments were then countered by Peter van der Veen and Robert Porter.&lt;ref name=vanderveen&gt;van der Veen, P.G. (2000) "[http://www.bga.nl/en/discussion/engveen.html Is Rohl's Chronology inaccurate? A reply to BGA']," ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'', December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Porter&gt;Porter, R.M. (2000) "[http://www.bga.nl/en/discussion/enfilpo.html 'Did the Philistines settle in Canaan around 1200 BC?]", ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'', December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In the final article in the issue, van der Land identified some new issues for Rohl's chronology arising from recent finds in Assyrian letters.&lt;ref&gt;van der Land, J.G. (2000), "[http://www.bga.nl/en/discussion/engbaboe.html Conclusive evidence against Rohl's proposed New Chronology: An Assyrian chancellor's archive"], ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'', December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3234">A '''nutrient enema''', also known as '''feeding per rectum''', '''rectal alimentation''', or '''rectal feeding''', is an [[enema]] administered with the intent of providing [[nutrition]] when normal [[eating]] is not possible. Although this treatment is ancient, dating back at least to [[Galen]] and a common technique in 19th century medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1987791|title=The nutrient enema|author=J. W. A. Mackenzie|date=March 1943|doi=10.1136/adc.18.93.22 |pmid=21032242|volume=18|issue=93|journal=Arch. Dis. Child.|pages=22–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; nutrient enemas have been superseded in modern medical care by [[tube feeding]] and [[Parenteral nutrition|intravenous feeding]].

A variety of different mixes have been used for nutrient enemas throughout history. A paper published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1926 stated that because the [[rectum]] and lower [[digestive tract]] lack [[digestive enzyme]]s, it is likely that only the end-products of normal digestion such as [[sugars]], [[amino acid]]s, [[salt]] and [[alcohol]], will be absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Rectal Alimentation| journal = Nature| volume = 118| pages = 858–859| year = 1926| doi = 10.1038/118858a0|bibcode = 1926Natur.118..858.| issue=2980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This treatment was given to U.S. President [[James A. Garfield]] after his shooting in 1881, and is asserted to have prolonged his life.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, D. W. "Feeding Per Rectum: As Illustrated in the Case of the Late President Garfield and Others". Washington: N.p., n.d. Rpt. from the Medical Record, July 15, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[United States Senate]] [[United States Senate Intelligence Committee|Intelligence Committee]] published an [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture|unclassified summary]] of its 6,000 page classified report on the [[CIA]]'s use of [[torture]], its previously unknown use of "rectal rehydration" for punishment and torture became apparent.&lt;ref name=MiamiHerald2014-12-09&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8526">'''Photodegradation''' is the alteration of materials by light.  Typically, the term refers to the combined action of  [[sunlight]] and [[air]]. Photodegradation is usually [[oxidation]] and [[hydrolysis]].  Often photodegradation is avoided, since it destroys paintings and other artifacts. It is however partly responsible for remineralization of biomass and is used intentionally in some disinfection technologies. Photodegradation does not apply to how materials may be aged or degraded via [[infrared light]] or heat, but does include degradation in all of the [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] wavebands.

==Applications==

===Foodstuffs===
The protection of food from photodegradation is very important. Some nutrients, like those found in [[beer]] for example, are affected by degradation when being exposed to sunlight. In the case of beer, the UV radiation causes a process, which entails the degradation of hop bitter compounds to 3-Methyl-2-buten-1-thiol and therefore changes the taste. As amber glass has the ability to absorb UV radiation, beer bottles are often made from this glass type to avoid this process.

=== Paints, inks and dyes ===
Paints, inks and dyes that are organic are more susceptible to photodegradation than those that are not. Ceramics are almost universally colored with non-organic origin materials so as to allow the material to resist photodegradation even under the most relentless conditions, maintaining its color.

===Pesticides and herbicides ===
The photodegradation of pesticides is of great interest because of the scale of agriculture and the intensive use of chemicals.  Pesticides are however selected in part not to photodegrade readily in sunlight in order to allow them to exert their biocidal activity.  Thus, additional modalities are implemented to enhance their photodegradation, including the use of photosensitizers, photocatalysts (e.g., [[titanium dioxide]]), and the addition of reagents such as [[hydrogen peroxide]] that would generate hydroxyl radicals that would attack the pesticides.&lt;ref name=burrows&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burrows|first1=H.D.|last2=Canle L|first2=M.|last3=Santaballa|first3=J.A.|last4=Steenken|first4=S.|title=Reaction pathways and mechanisms of photodegradation of pesticides|journal=Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology|date=June 2002|volume=67|issue=2|pages=71–108|doi=10.1016/S1011-1344(02)00277-4|hdl=10316/5187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmaceuticals===
The photodegradation of pharmaceuticals is of interest because they are found in many water supplies.  They have deleterious effects on aquatic organisms including toxicity, endocrine disruption, genetic damage.&lt;ref name=boreen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boreen|first1=Anne L.|last2=Arnold|first2=William A.|last3=McNeill|first3=Kristopher|title=Photodegradation of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment: A review|journal=Aquatic Sciences|date=1 December 2003|volume=65|issue=4|pages=320–341|doi=10.1007/s00027-003-0672-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; But also in the primary packaging material the photodegradation of pharmaceuticals has to be prevented. For this, amber [[glasses]] like [[Fiolax |Fiolax amber]] and Corning 51-L are commonly used to protect the pharmaceutical from UV radiations. Iodine (in the form of [[Lugol's solution]]) and collodial silver are universally used in packaging that lets through very little UV light so as to avoid degradation.

===Polymers===
{{main|Photo-oxidation of polymers}}
[[Image:Failedrope1.jpg|thumb|300px|Effect of UV exposure on [[polypropylene]] rope]]
Common synthetic polymers that can be attacked include [[polypropylene]] and [[LDPE]], where [[tertiary carbon]] bonds in their chain structures are the centres of attack. Ultraviolet rays interact with these bonds to form [[free radicals]], which then react further with [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere, producing [[carbonyl]] groups in the main chain. The exposed surfaces of products may then discolour and crack, and in extreme cases, complete product disintegration can occur. 

In fibre products like [[rope]] used in outdoor applications, product life will be low because the outer fibres will be attacked first, and will easily be damaged by [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] for example. Discolouration of the rope may also occur, thus giving an early warning of the problem. 

Polymers which possess UV-absorbing groups such as [[aromatic ring]]s may also be sensitive to UV degradation. [[Aramid]] fibres like [[Kevlar]], for example, are highly UV-sensitive and must be protected from the deleterious effects of sunlight.

==Mechanism==

Many organic chemicals are thermodynamically unstable in the presence of oxygen, however, their rate of spontaneous oxidation is slow at room temperature.  In the language of physical chemistry, such reactions are kinetically limited.  This kinetic stability allows the accumulation of complex environmental structures in the environment. Upon the absorption of light, triplet oxygen converts to [[singlet oxygen]], a highly reactive form of the gas, which effects spin-allowed oxidations.  In the atmosphere, the organic compounds are degraded by [[hydroxyl radical]]s, which are produced from water and ozone.&lt;ref name=Simmler&gt;Walter Simmler "Air, 6. Photochemical Degradation" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2011, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Photochemical reactions are initiated by the absorption of a photon, typically in the wavelength range 290-700&amp;nbsp;nm (at the surface of the Earth).  The energy of an absorbed photon is transferred to electrons in the molecule and briefly changes their configuration (i.e., promotes the molecule from a [[ground state]] to an [[excited state]]).  The excited state represents what is essentially a new molecule.  Often excited state molecules are not kinetically stable in the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and can spontaneously decompose ([[oxidize]] or [[hydrolyze]]).  Sometimes molecules decompose to produce high energy, unstable fragments that can react with other molecules around them.  The two processes are collectively referred to as direct photolysis or indirect [[photolysis]], and both mechanisms contribute to the removal of pollutants.

The United States federal standard for testing plastic for photo-degradation is 40 CFR Ch. I (7–1–03 Edition)PART 238

==Protection against photodegradation==
Photodegradation of plastics and other materials can be inhibited with additives, which are widely used.  These additives include [[antioxidant]]s, which interrupt degradation processes.  Typical antioxidants are derivatives of [[aniline]].  Another type of additive are UV-absorbers.  These agents capture the photon and convert it to heat.  Typical UV-absorbers are hydroxy-substituted [[benzophenone]]s, related to the chemicals used in [[sunscreen]].&lt;ref name=Wolf&gt;Rainer Wolf, Bansi Lal Kaul "Plastics, Additives" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8570">[[Image:Piazzetta telematica for journalists -Italia90 - Roma.JPG|thumb|Piazzetta telematica "Italia '90" for journalists — Roma 1990.]]

In the fields of [[urban planning]], [[urban regeneration]] and [[e-government]], the term '''''piazza telematica''''' has been used in Italy since the early 1990s by a number of [[community network]] and local institutions for promoting the insertion, inside the urban upgrading processes, of the principles of [[sustainable development]] and of [[accessibility]] for all to [[Information technology|IT]] tools for assuring the Right of [[Citizenship]]: the possibilities to participate in public decision processes, to access to the knowledge and training, to take part of the social [[local community]] life.

The term piazza telematica evokes a hybrid space indebted in equal parts to the real (with territorial components) and the [[Virtuality|virtual]] space that has to be considered as a whole, a new [[glocal]] (global – local) [[public space]] with a great symbolic value for the [[democracy|democratic]] interaction and for the social life.

The word “[[piazza]]” underlines the semantic significance of a [[public space]] traditionally located in the heart of  the [[town]] centre or of  a [[village]] and dedicated to [[communication]], [[meeting]], and the exchange of material goods and, at present, through the use of telematics systems and services, to the exchange also of immaterial goods (new virtual services and functions: [[Telecommuting]], [[Coworking]], online [[Training]] through [[Multi-monitor]], [[Telemedicine]], [[Electronic commerce]] and the new [[Sustainable mobility]] services such as [[Bike sharing]] and [[Car sharing]].

== History ==
*1990 - The term Piazza Telematica is used for the first time in newspapers and magazines in order to describe the telematics systems and services set up for the journalists in the 12 Italian cities hosting the [[FIFA World Cup 1990]].
*1994 - Participation to the ACT-VILL project of the Direction XII [[Science]] and Technology of the [[European Union]] for the city of the 21st century corresponding to new concepts synthesised in three scenarios:
**[[Sustainable city]], a city that internalise the problems it generates, solving them instead of transferring to other or to the future. 
**"[[Glocal]]" city (global/local), a city with a better balance between the [[globalisation]] process and the ability to use local resources. 
**Post-modern or [[agora]] city, a human centred city with a harmonic relationship between the [[citizen]] and the [[urban design]].
*1995 - Participation to the European conference ''Urban utopias: new tools for the [[European Urban Renaissance]], promoted by the Direction XII [[Science]] and Technology of the [[European Union]] and hosted by the Municipality of [[Berlin]].
*2004 - The first pilot project of a Piazza Telematica, supported by the European Union (div. XVI for social cohesion and sustainable development) is opened to the general public in [[Naples]] (Italy) in the bourough of Scampia.

In some other pilot projects, as is the case for the Piazza Telematica of the Municipality of Provaglio d'Iseo, the term Piazza Telematica is used in order to evoke a virtual space on the Internet open to all citizens for the exchange of ideas, proposals and participation, through [[Internet forum|forum]] and other [[World Wide Web|web]] instruments, to the socio-cultural and economic life of the [[community]].

A '''polyphenic trait''' is a trait for which multiple, discrete [[phenotype]]s can arise from a single [[genotype]] as a result of differing environmental conditions. It is therefore a special case of [[phenotypic plasticity]].

There are several types of polyphenism in animals, from having sex determined by the environment to the castes of honey bees and other social insects. Some polyphenisms are seasonal, as in some butterflies which have different patterns during the year, and some Arctic animals like the [[snowshoe hare]] and [[Arctic fox]], which are white in winter. Other animals have predator-induced or resource polyphenisms, allowing them to exploit variations in their environment. Some nematode worms can develop either into adults or into resting [[dauer larva]]e according to resource availability.

==Definition==
[[file:Termites polymorphism.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Polyphenism in [[termite]]s&lt;br /&gt;

    B : Primary queen &lt;br /&gt;
    C : Secondary queen &lt;br /&gt;
    D : Tertiary queen &lt;br /&gt;
    E : Soldiers &lt;br /&gt;
    F : Worker]]

A '''polyphenism''' is a biological mechanism that causes a trait to be polyphenic. For example, [[crocodile]]s possess a sex-determining polyphenism, and therefore their gender is a polyphenic trait.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1993.0059 |title=On the Effect of Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination on Sex Ratio and Survivorship in Crocodilians |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=252 |issue=1334 |pages=149–155 |year=1993 |last1=Woodward |first1=D. E |last2=Murray |first2=J. D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When polyphenic forms exist at the same time in the same [[panmictic]] (interbreeding) population they can be compared to [[polymorphism (biology)|genetic polymorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ford,  E. B. |authorlink=E. B. Ford |date=1975 |title=Ecological genetics |edition=4th |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |pages= }}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With polyphenism the switch between morphs is environmental, but with genetic polymorphism the determination of morph is genetic. These two cases have in common that more than one morph is part of the population at any one time. This is rather different from cases where one morph predictably follows another during, for instance, the course of a year. In essence the latter is normal [[ontogeny]] where young forms can and do have different forms, colours and habits to adults.

The discrete nature of polyphenic traits differentiates them from traits like weight and height, which are also dependent on environmental conditions but vary continuously across a spectrum. When a polyphenism is present, an environmental cue causes the organism to develop along a separate pathway, resulting in distinct morphologies; thus, the response to the environmental cue is “all or nothing.” The nature of these environmental conditions varies greatly, and includes seasonal cues like temperature and moisture, [[pheromone|pheromonal]] cues, [[kairomone|kairomonal]] cues (signals released from one species that can be recognized by another), and nutritional cues.

==Types==

===Sex determination===
Sex-determining polyphenisms allow a species to benefit from [[sexual reproduction]] while permitting an unequal [[gender]] ratio. This can be beneficial to a species because a large female-to-male ratio maximizes reproductive capacity. However, temperature-dependent sex determination (as seen in crocodiles) limits the range in which a species can exist, and makes the species susceptible to endangerment by changes in weather pattern.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; Temperature-dependent sex determination has been proposed as an explanation for the extinction of the dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=S.F. |year=2003 |title=Developmental Biology |edition=7th |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=727–737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population-dependent and reversible sex determination, found in animals such as the [[blue wrasse]] fish, have less potential for failure. In the blue wrasse, only one male is found in a given territory: [[larva]]e within the territory develop into females, and adult males will not enter the same territory. If a male dies, one of the females in his territory becomes male, replacing him.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt; While this system ensures that there will always be a mating couple when two animals of the same species are present, it could potentially decrease genetic variance in a population, for example if the females remain in a single male's territory.

===Insect castes===
[[File:Closeup on honeypot ants (Myrmecocystus mimicus) at Oakland Zoo.jpg|thumb|Insect castes: Replete and worker honeypot ants ''[[Myrmecocystus mimicus]]'']]

The caste system of insects enables [[eusociality]], the division of labor between non-breeding and breeding individuals. A series of polyphenisms determines whether larvae develop into queens, workers, and, in some cases soldiers. In the case of the [[ant]], ''P. morrisi'', an embryo must develop under certain temperature and photoperiod conditions in order to become a reproductively-active queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1071468 |pmid=12114626 |title=Evolution of the Gene Network Underlying Wing Polyphenism in Ants |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5579 |pages=249–52 |year=2002 |last1=Abouheif |first1=E. |last2=Wray |first2=G. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for control of the mating season but, like sex determination, limits the spread of the species into certain [[climate]]s.
In bees, [[royal jelly]] provided by [[worker bee]]s causes a developing larva to become a [[queen bee|queen]]. Royal jelly is only produced when the queen is aging or has died. This system is less subject to influence by environmental conditions, yet prevents unnecessary production of queens.

===Seasonal===&lt;!-- [[Seasonal polyphenism]] redirects here --&gt;
{{further|Snow camouflage}}

Polyphenic [[biological pigment|pigmentation]] is adaptive for insect species that undergo multiple mating seasons each year. Different pigmentation patterns provide appropriate [[camouflage]] throughout the seasons, as well as alter heat retention as temperatures change.&lt;ref name="Braendle2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bies.20456 |pmid=16937342 |title=A role for genetic accommodation in evolution? |journal=BioEssays |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=868–73 |year=2006 |last1=Braendle |first1=Christian |last2=Flatt |first2=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because insects cease growth and development after [[eclosion]], their pigment pattern is invariable in adulthood: thus, a polyphenic pigment adaptation would be less valuable for species whose adult form survives longer than one year.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

Birds and mammals are capable of continued physiological changes in adulthood, and some display reversible seasonal polyphenisms, such as in the [[Arctic fox]], which becomes all white in winter as [[snow camouflage]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

===Predator-induced===
Predator-induced polyphenisms allow the species to develop in a more reproductively-successful way in a [[predator]]'s absence, but to otherwise assume a more defensible morphology. However, this can fail if the predator evolves to stop producing the [[kairomone]] to which the prey responds. For example, the fly larvae that feed on ''Daphnia cucullata'' (a [[water flea]]) release a kairomone that ''Daphnia'' can detect. When the fly larvae are present, ''Daphnia'' grow large helmets that protect them from being eaten. However, when the predator is absent, ''Daphnia'' have smaller heads and are therefore more agile swimmers.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

===Resource===
Organisms with resource polyphenisms show alternative phenotypes that allow differential use of food or other resources. One example is the [[Spea|western spadefoot toad]], which maximizes its reproductive capacity in temporary [[desert]] ponds. While the water is at a safe level, the tadpoles develop slowly on a diet of other opportunistic pond inhabitants. However, when the water level is low and desiccation is imminent, the tadpoles develop a morphology (wide mouth, strong jaw) that permits them to cannibalize. Cannibalistic tadpoles receive better nutrition and thus metamorphose more quickly, avoiding death as the pond dries up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00442-004-1672-6 |pmid=15300488 |title=Reassessment of the environmental mechanisms controlling developmental polyphenism in spadefoot toad tadpoles |journal=Oecologia |volume=141 |issue=3 |pages=402–10 |year=2004 |last1=Storz |first1=Brian L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[invertebrates]], the nematode ''[[Pristionchus pacificus]]'' has one morph that primarily feeds on bacteria and a second morph that produces large teeth, enabling it to feed on other nematodes, including competitors for bacterial food. In this species, cues of starvation and crowding by other nematodes, as sensed by pheromones, trigger a [[hormone|hormonal]] signal that ultimately activates a developmental switch gene that specifies formation of the predatory morph.&lt;ref name="Ragsdale2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.054 |pmid=24209628 |title=A Developmental Switch Coupled to the Evolution of Plasticity Acts through a Sulfatase |journal=Cell |volume=155 |issue=4 |pages=922–33 |year=2013 |last1=Ragsdale |first1=Erik J. |last2=Müller |first2=Manuela R. |last3=Rödelsperger |first3=Christian |last4=Sommer |first4=Ralf J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Density-dependent ===
Density-dependent polyphenism allows species to show a different phenotype based on the population density in which it was reared. In [[Lepidoptera]], [[African armyworm]] larvae exhibit one of two appearances: the gregarious or solitary phase. Under crowded or "gregarious" conditions, the larvae have black bodies and yellow stripes along their bodies. However, under solitary conditions, they have green bodies with a brown stripe down their backs. The different phenotypes emerge during the third instar and remain until the last instar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1570-7458.1998.00273.x |title=The determination of larval phase coloration in the African armyworm, Spodoptera exempta and its consequences for thermoregulation and protection from UV light |journal=Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=125–33 |year=1998 |last1=Gunn |first1=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dauer diapause in nematodes===
[[File:Third stage Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita.png|thumb|Third stage [[dauer larva]] (resting stage) of ''[[Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita]]'']]

Under conditions of stress such as crowding and high temperature, L2 larvae of some free living nematodes such as ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' can switch development to the so-called [[dauer larva]] state, instead of going the normal molts into a reproductive adult. These dauer larvae are a stress-resistant, non-feeding, long-lived stage, enabling the animals to survive harsh conditions. On return to favorable conditions, the animal resumes reproductive development from L3 stage onwards.

==Evolution==
A mechanism has been proposed for the [[evolution]]ary development of polyphenisms:&lt;ref name="Braendle2006" /&gt;

#A mutation results in a novel, heritable trait.
#The trait’s frequency expands in the population, creating a population on which selection can act.
#Pre-existing (background) genetic variation in other genes results in phenotypic differences in expression of the new trait.
#These phenotypic differences undergo selection; as genotypic differences narrow, the trait becomes:
##Genetically fixed (non-responsive to environmental conditions)
##Polyphenic (responsive to environmental conditions)

Evolution of novel polyphenisms through this mechanism has been demonstrated in the laboratory. Suzuki and Nijhout used an existing mutation (''black'') in a monophenic green hornworm (''[[Manduca sexta]]'') that causes a black phenotype. They found that if larvae from an existing population of ''black'' mutants were raised at 20˚C, then all the final [[instar]] larvae were black; but if the larvae were instead raised at 28˚C, the final instar larvae ranged in color from black to green. By selecting for larvae that were black if raised at 20˚C but green if raised at 28˚C, they produced a polyphenic strain after thirteen generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1118888 |pmid=16456077 |title=Evolution of a Polyphenism by Genetic Accommodation |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5761 |pages=650–2 |year=2006 |last1=Suzuki |first1=Y |last2=Nijhout |first2=H. F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This fits the model described above because a new mutation (black) was required to reveal pre-existing genetic variation and to permit selection. Furthermore, the production of a polyphenic strain was only possible because of background variation within the species: two alleles, one temperature-sensitive and one stable, were present for a single gene upstream of ''black'' (in the pigment production pathway) before selection occurred. The temperature-sensitive allele was not observable because at high temperatures, it caused an increase in green pigment in hornworms that were already bright green. However, introduction of the black mutant caused the temperature-dependent changes in pigment production to become obvious. The researchers could then select for larvae with the temperature-sensitive [[allele]], resulting in a polyphenism.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

'''Preservation metadata''' is an essential component of most [[digital preservation]] strategies. As an increasing proportion of the world’s information output shifts from analog to digital form, it is necessary to develop new strategies to preserve this information for the long-term. Preservation metadata is information that supports and documents the digital preservation process. Preservation metadata is sometimes considered a subset of technical or administrative metadata.

==Preservation metadata==
Preservation metadata stores technical details on the format, structure and use of the digital content, the history of all actions performed on the resource including changes and decisions, the authenticity information such as technical features or custody history, and the responsibilities and rights information applicable to preservation actions.&lt;ref name="PADI"&gt;''[http://www.nla.gov.au/padi/topics/32.html Preserving Access to Digital Information]'', [[National Library of Australia]]. Retrieved April 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation metadata is access-centered and should accomplish four themes: include details about files and instructions for use; document all updates or actions that have occurred to an object; show provenance and demonstrate current and future custody; list details on the individual(s) who are responsible for the preservation of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Woodyard, D., Metadata and preservation. ''[[Information Services and Use]]'', 22:121–125, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation metadata often includes the following information:

* ''Provenance:'' Who has had custody/ownership of the digital object?
* ''Authenticity:'' Is the digital object what it purports to be?
* ''Preservation activity:'' What has been done to preserve the digital object?
* ''Technical environment:'' What is needed to render, interact with and use the digital object?
* ''Rights management:'' What intellectual property rights must be observed?&lt;ref name = "LOC"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis Library of Congress.  PREMIS: Preservation Metadata Maintenance Activity]. Retrieved April 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital materials require constant maintenance and migration to new formats as technology changes. In order to survive into the future, digital objects need preservation metadata that can exist independently from the systems which were used to create them. Without preservation metadata, digital material will be lost. “''While a print book with a broken spine can be easily re-bound, a digital object that has become corrupted or obsolete is often impossible (or prohibitively expensive) to repair''”.&lt;ref&gt;Lavoie, B. &amp; Dempsey, L., [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july04/lavoie/07lavoie.html Thirteen ways of looking at...digital preservation], ''[[D-Lib Magazine]]'', 10 (7/8), 2004. Retrieved April 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Preservation metadata provides the vital information which will make “digital objects self-documenting across time.”&lt;ref name = "LOC"/&gt;

Preservation metadata is a new and developing field. The Reference Model for an [[Open Archival Information System]] (OAIS) is a broad conceptual model which many organizations have followed in developing new preservation metadata element sets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nost.gsfc.nasa.gov/isoas/ref_model.html Reference model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412100933/http://nost.gsfc.nasa.gov/isoas/ref_model.html |date=2008-04-12 }}, [[NASA]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early projects in preservation metadata in the library community include CEDARS, NEDLIB, The National Library of Australia and the OCLC/RLG Working Group on Preservation Metadata.&lt;ref name="PADI" /&gt; Following on from this work, the [[Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS)]] Working Group created the "Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata: Final Report of the PREMIS Working Group" which was released in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/pmwg/ OCLC/RLG PREMIS (PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies)], [http://www.oclc.org/ OCLC].&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing work of maintaining, supporting, and coordinating future revisions to the PREMIS Data Dictionary is undertaken by the PREMIS Editorial Committee, hosted by the Library of Congress.&lt;ref name="LOC" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25740">In [[linguistics]], a '''relativizer''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] '''{{sc|rel}}''')  is a type of [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] that introduces a [[relative clause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Paul|title=Parts-of-speech systems|year=1985|pages=3–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in English, the conjunction ''that'' may be considered a relativizer in a sentence such as "I have one that you can use."&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;Fox, Barbara A. and Thompson, Sandra A. (2007) "Relative Clauses in English conversation: Relativizers, frequency, and the notion of construction", Studies in Language, 31 (2), p.&amp;nbsp;293-326(34).&lt;/ref&gt; Relativizers do not appear, at least overtly, in all languages; even in languages that do have overt or pronounced relativizers, they do not necessarily appear all of the time. For these reasons it has been suggested that in some cases, a "[[Zero (linguistics)|zero]] relativizer" may be present, meaning that a relativizer is implied in the grammar but is not actually realized in speech or writing.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt; For example, the word ''that'' can be omitted in the above English example, producing "I have one you can use", using (on this analysis) a zero relativizer.

==Analysis==

Since as far back as 1712, people have written about relativizers and what functions they have.  They have been classified as conjunctions in earlier times, and have later been referred to as clause markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Ralph|title=The Sentence and its Parts|year=1961|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago &amp; London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are known today as relativizers. Despite an agreement in nomenclature, there are multiple analyses which attempt to account for the grammatical function and distribution of relativizers.

===Promotional analysis===

The promotional analysis is a transformational analysis from 1973 depicting relative clauses in English, and how relative pronouns are introduced into the embedded clause.  This analysis assumes that there is no overt head noun in the [[deep structure]] of the [[main clause]].  In order to form a relative construction, the noun phrase from the embedded clause is promoted to the empty head of the noun phrase of the main clause.  From there, a corresponding relative pronoun leaves a trace in the space of the vacated noun phrase in the embedded clause.&lt;ref name="Ihalainen 1981 371–375"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ihalainen|first=Ossi|title=Promotion vs Matching: Two Competing Transformational Analyses of English Relative Clauses|journal=English Studies|year=1981|volume=62|issue=4|pages=371–375|doi=10.1080/00138388108598127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example:
[[File:Figure 1, Tree displaying Promotional Analysis.jpeg|thumb|center|250px|Figure 1:  Tree displaying Promotional Analysis]]

===Matching analysis===
The Matching Analysis is another type of transformational analysis from the 1970s, which was in competition with the Promotional Analysis at that time.  In this analysis the relative pronoun is introduced into the embedded clause by corresponding or matching to the head noun in the main clause.  This is done by taking the noun phrase from the embedded sentence in the deep structure that matches the head noun in the noun phrase of the main clause, and replacing it with a relative pronoun.  The relative pronoun thus co-references the head noun in the main clause.  Finally, the relative pronoun is moved to the clause-initial position.&lt;ref name="Ihalainen 1981 371–375"/&gt;  For example:
[[File:Matching Analysis.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Figure 2: Tree displaying Matching Analysis]]

===Ouhallian analysis===

There are two separate phrasal heads that relativizers can occupy. Cross-linguistically, relativizers may occupy either the head of a [[complementizer]] phrase (C-Type Relativizer) or the head of a determiner phrase (D-Type Relativizer).  C-Type Relativizers can introduce a relative clause as an argument of a noun phrase, or they can introduce a relative clause as an argument of a verb phrase. D-Type Relativizers may only introduce a relative clause as an argument of a noun phrase. English is a language which uses a C-Type Relativizer, that, as a part of its relativization strategy because "that" can introduce a relative clause as either the argument to a [[Noun Phrase]] or the argument to a Complementizer Phrase. The following examples from English shows the same morpheme being used in both syntactic contexts.&lt;ref name="Ouhalla"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ouhalla|first=Jamal|title=Semitic Relatives|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|year=2004|volume=35|issue=2|pages=288–300|doi=10.1162/002438904323019084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[File:DtypeRelativizer.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Figure 4: Tree displaying Relativizer as an argument to the Noun Phrase]]
|}

Conversely, Arabic uses two phonologically distinct morphemes to account for these syntactic phenomena. In the same sentences in a D-Type language like Arabic, each example would employ the use of a different morpheme as shown in examples 1 &amp; 2.&lt;ref name=Ouhalla/&gt;

 1) ''paris '''lli''' bħibba
    ''Paris '''RM''' I.love.it'''''
    The Paris '''that''' I love

 2) ''xabbaret-na laila '''ʔenno''' l-mmaslin mʔadrabiin
    ''told-us laila '''that''' the-actors on.strike''
    Laila told us '''that''' the actors are on strike.''

==In modern English==

There are three types of relativizers used in English to introduce relative clauses: zero or null relativizers, ''wh''-relativizers, and the ''that''-relativizer.&lt;ref name="sag"&gt;Sag, Ivana A. 1997. “[https://www.academia.edu/download/31190371/10.1.1.51.7483.pdf English relative clause constructions]”. Journal of linguistics. 33 (2), p. 431-483. DOI: 10.1017/S002222679700652X&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative distribution of null and overt relativizers===

'''Relativizers''' have been analyzed to be optional in certain languages and are variably omitted in the English language.  Such relativizer omission, or use of the null or zero variant of relativizers, does not pattern uniformly in English and has been predicted to be conditioned and constrained by a number of linguistic and social factors.&lt;ref name=Levey&gt;Levey, Stephen and Hill, Carolyn. (2013). “Social and Linguistic Constraints on Relativizer Omission in Canadian English”, American Speech, 88 (1), p. 32-62.]&lt;/ref&gt;  These social factors and the potential influence of age, gender, and education have been minimally explored and seem to exhibit a lesser effect on relativizer omission.  [[Linguistics|Linguistic]] constraints, such as sentence structure and [[syntax|syntactic]] position of the relativizer, [[clause|main clause]] construction type, lexical specificity of the head NP, type of antecedent, and the adjacency, length, and grammatical subject of the [[relative clause]] have been implicated as having more significant influence on the patterning of relativizer omission in Canadian English.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  The omission of relativizers tends to occur more frequently in conversation than in formal writing.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;

====Distribution with subject and object relative clauses====
The syntactic position or function of the relativizer in the relative clause is a major determiner for the choice of relative marker.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  The null relativizer variant is more common in object than subject relative clauses.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;
 3) ''I have friends '''that''' are moving in together.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''  (subject)
 4) ''That's one thing '''that''' I actually admire very much in my father.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''  (direct object)
 5) ''Everyone's kinda used to the age group '''[Ø]''' they work with.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''  (object of preposition)

====Informational content of the main clause determines distribution====
There is a preference for null relativizers when a [[clause|main clause]] that is informationally light is directly ''adjacent'' to the [[relative clause]].&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  For example:
 6) ''It's just kinda something '''[Ø]''' I noticed recently.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 7) ''They get values and stuff like that from church '''that''' they might not get at home.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
In this example, the main clause 'it's just kinda something' provides little [[semantics|semantic]] information and it is adjacent to the relative clause 'I noticed recently'.  As such, it is thought that the main clause and the relative clause are processed together as a unitary processing chunk that is functioning like a single statement, which results in a null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;

====Distribution with empty head noun phrases====
Empty head [[noun phrase]]s, which are not lexically specific and which index generic groups or sets, have been correlated with the use of the null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  Examples of empty noun phrases include words like ''all'', ''way'', ''time'', etc.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;
 8) ''All '''[Ø]''' she wants to do is sleep.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 9) ''She held onto all those jewelry boxes '''that''' everybody made for her when we were kids.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''

Unique head [[noun phrase]]s, which include [[superlative]]s and [[noun]]s with the words ''only'' and ''first'', also take the null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  For example:
 10) ''That's the only place '''[Ø]''' you can go at night.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 11) ''That's the first compliment '''[Ø]''' I've got in a long time.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 12) ''That was the worst job '''[Ø]''' I ever had.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 13) ''You have a home here '''that''' you could rent.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''

====Length of the noun phrase determines distribution====
Longer head [[noun phrase]]s often co-occur with an overt relativizer, whereas shorter noun phrases are more likely to co-occur with a null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  For example:
 14) ''This pair of suede pants '''that''' I got.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 15) ''The weight '''[Ø]''' I should be at.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
In these examples, the first sentence contains a longer noun phrase ('This pair of suede pants') in comparison to the second sentence, which contains a very short noun phrase ('The weight').  Thus, it is observed that the sentence containing the longer noun phrase also contains the relativizer 'that', whereas the sentence with the shorter noun phrase has a null relativizer.

====Definiteness of the noun phrase determines distribution====
Null relativizers have been found to be correlated to the definiteness of the nominal antecedent.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  For example:
 16) ''I don't think you have the dedicated teacher '''that''' I had.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 17) ''And it was a guy '''[Ø]''' she worked with for a few years.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
The first sentence contains a definite noun phrase, whereas the second sentence contains an indefinite noun phrase which co-occurs with the null relativizer.

====Distribution with relative clause pronominal subjects====
When the grammatical subject of a relative clause is a pronoun, it is more likely that the relativizer will be omitted.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  When the subject of a relative clause is a full noun phrase, the overt relativizer will be retained.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  For example:
 18) ''I have two cats '''[Ø]''' I'd like to turn in to the Humane Society.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 19) ''Do you remember exactly the road '''[Ø]''' I'm talking about?&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 20) ''That was one of the things '''[Ø]''' he did when he was living elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 21) ''I always go to my girlfriends 'cause there's stuff '''that''' your parents just don't need to know.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''

===Distribution of overt English relativizers===
{{Main|English relative clauses}}
The overt relativizers of Modern English include the words '''“which”''', '''“what”''', '''“when”''', '''“where”''', '''“who”''', '''“whom”''' and '''“whose”''', and these can be referred to within linguistics as "''wh''-words". These are officially classified as [[relative pronouns]], but can be referred to as “''wh''-relativizers” in instances where their function is to introduce a [[relative clause]].
The other overt relativizer of Modern English is the word '''“that”''', which can be referred to as the “''that''-relativizer” where it introduces a relative clause. There is some debate as to whether to classify it as a relative pronoun - like the wh-words, a [[subordinating conjunction]], or a [[complementizer]].&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt; The distribution of the different types of English relativizers varies depending on several factors.

====Fused relative clauses====
Fused relative clauses, sometimes referred to as “free” relative clauses, are different from most other types of relative clauses in that there is no nominal antecedent to which the relative clause refers. In many cases, the relativizers of English are relative pronouns, meaning that they are in [[coreference]] with a noun that precedes them in the sentence. This nominal function is “fused” with the relative clause in free relatives, and this leaves the relativizer without an overt entity to which it can refer. For example:
 22) ''I wonder '''what''' inspired them&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 23) ''I wonder '''whose''' dog died&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
There is no noun preceding the relative clause in these cases, and that is why it is said that this noun’s function is “fused” with the relative clause.

====Grammatical function of the relativized nominal determines relativizer case form====
Where there are different [[grammatical case]] forms of a relativizer, the case form that surfaces will depend on the [[grammatical function]] of the noun that appears previously in the sentence to which the relative clause refers, known as the nominal antecedent. The only examples in Modern English of this phenomenon are the forms “who” and “whom”. “Who” surfaces when it refers to a noun that is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the main clause, and “whom” surfaces when it refers to a noun that is an [[object (grammar)|object]] of the main clause. However, speaker judgments vary as to whether it is grammatical for "who" to surface when it is referring to an object of the main clause. Since, depending on speaker judgments, either only "whom" or both "who and "whom" can grammatically introduce a relative clause referring to an object, there is an "m" in brackets on the end of the relativizer in example (21) below.
* Subject antecedent
 24) ''The person '''who''' visited Kim&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
* Object antecedent
 25) ''The chairman listened to the student '''who(m)''' the professor gave a low grade to&lt;ref&gt;Eckman, Fred R. and Bell, Lawrence and Nelson, Diane. "On the generalization of relative clause instruction in the acquisition of English as a second language", Applied Linguistics. (1988), 9 (1), p. 1-20. DOI: 10.1093/applin/9.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;''

====Animacy of the antecedent determines distribution====
Only certain relativizers can introduce clauses that refer to human antecedents, and similarly, only certain relativizers can introduce clauses that refer to non-human antecedents. “Who”, “whom”, and “whose” can only refer to human antecedents, “which”, and “what” can only refer to non-human antecedents. “That”, however, can refer to both human and non-human antecedents. To exemplify: 
* Human antecedent
 26) ''The Pat '''that''' I like is a genius&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 27) ''The Pat '''who''' I like is a genius&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 28) ''The only person '''that''' I like '''whose''' kids Dana is willing to put up with is Pat&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
* Non-human antecedent
 29) ''Every essay '''that''' she's written '''which''' I've read is on that pile&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 30) ''Every essay '''which''' she's written '''that''' I've read is on that pile&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''

====Restrictiveness of the relative clause determines distribution====
Restrictive relative clauses add extraneous information that is not vital for the listener or reader’s understanding of which aforementioned noun is being referenced; or in other words, which noun is the nominal antecedent. Both ''wh''-relativizers and the ''that''-relativizer can be used to introduce restrictive relative clauses. Nonrestrictive relative clauses have [[semantic]] properties which make them necessary to prevent the sentence from being ambiguous. They are used in cases where the context that surrounds the sentence is not sufficient for the distinction between the potential nominal antecedents. Commas mark nonrestrictive relative clauses, and only the ''wh''-relativizers can be used to introduce them. To exemplify:
* Restrictive sentences:
 31) ''He has four sons '''that''' became lawyers &lt;ref name="bache"&gt;Bache, Carl and Jakobsen, Leif K. (1980) "On the distribution between restrictive and nonrestrictive relative clauses in modern English", Lingua, 52 (2), p. 243-267&lt;/ref&gt;''
 32) ''The soldiers '''who''' were brave ran forward&lt;ref name="bache" /&gt;''
* Nonrestrictive sentences:
 33) ''He has four sons, '''who''' became lawyers&lt;ref name="bache" /&gt;''
 34) ''The soldiers, '''who''' were brave, ran forward&lt;ref name="bache" /&gt;''

====Finiteness of the relative clause determines distribution====
In non-finite clauses (clauses in which the verb is left unconjugated), the relativizer appears as an object of preposition, or in other words, directly after a preposition in the sentence. These relative clauses appear to be introduced by the preposition itself, but they are actually introduced by both the preposition and the relativizer, since these two grammatical particles form a “prepositional phrase”; and it is this phrase that introduces the clause. For example:
 35) A yard in '''which''' to have a party&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;
 36) The baker in '''whom''' to place your trust&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;
 37) A student *'''who''' to talk to us just walked in&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;
Note that (37) is ungrammatical because the relativizer introduces a non-finite relative clause, but it is not contained within a propositional phrase.

==Examples in other languages==

===Indonesian Teochew===
[[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] is a [[Chinese language]] originating from the [[Chaoshan]] region of the eastern Guangdong province.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"&gt;{{cite thesis | degree= Ph.D. |first= Annie |last= Peng |title= Aspects of the Syntax of Indonesian Teochew |publisher= University of Delaware |year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian Teochew refers to the Teochew dialect spoken in [[Indonesia]]. The most common way to form relative clauses in Indonesian Teochew is to use the relativizer ''kai''. These relative clauses can appear head-finally or head-initially.

====Jambi Teochew====
[[Jambi]] Teochew is a variety of Indonesian Teochew that is spoken in the province of Jambi on the island of [[Sumatra]]. In this language, the relativizer ''kai'' is used to form relative clauses. In these relative clauses, the ''kai'' is obligatory. This relativizer comes from the Chinese language. The relativizer ''yang'' is optional, and is borrowed from [[Malay language|Malaysian]]. The relativizer ''kai'' must always follow the modifying clause. If the optional relativizer ''yang'' is used, it would precede the modifying clause, as shown by example #43. If the relativizer ''kai'' is not present, the sentence becomes ungrammatical, regardless of whether ''yang'' is present or not.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; This is demonstrated in example #45.

 38) ''Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
      Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 39) '''''yang''' Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
      '''REL''' Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 40) ''*Aling phaʔ nongkiǎ khau.''
      Aling hit child cry
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 41) ''*'''yang''' Aling phaʔ nongkiǎ khau.''
      '''REL''' Aling hit child cry 
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

Another way of forming relative clauses in Jambi Teochew is through using the classifier. The main difference between the ''kai'' and classifier relative clause is that there is the presence of a classifier in the classifier relative clause.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; The classifier in classifier relative clauses can only appear head-initially.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; The classifier agrees with the head noun type and is in the place of the relativizer ''kai''.

 42) ''ka Aling '''kai''' kau zin tua tsiaʔ.''
       bite Aling '''REL''' dog very big CL.
       ‘The dog that bit Aling is a very big one.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 43) ''ka Aling '''tsiaʔ''' kau zin tua tsiaʔ.''
       bite Aling CL dog very big CL. 
       ‘The dog that big Aling is a very big one.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

Headless relative clauses do not have a pronounced head.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; It is the equivalent of “the one” in English. Headless relative clauses are formed with the relativizer ''kai''.  The Malaysian relativizer ''yang'' can be used optionally before the modifying clause.

 44) ''[zazik khau '''kai'''] si zi su m ui.''
       yesterday cry '''REL''' COP this CL one.
       ‘The one who cried yesterday is this one.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

The relativizer ''kai'' is obligatory.  In addition, it is not possible to form a headless relative clause with a classifier in the place of the relativizer ''kai''.

 45) ''zi pung phou si [Aling sia '''kai'''].''
       this CL book COP Aling write '''REL'''.
       ‘This book is the one that Aling wrote.’

 46) ''*zi pung phou si [Aling sia pung].''
       this CL book COP Aling write CL
       ‘This book is the one that Aling wrote.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

==== Pontianak Teochew ====
[[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]] Teochew is a variety of Indonesian Teochew that is spoken in the capital city of Pontianak in the province of [[West Kalimantan]]. The relativizer ''kai'' is used to form relative clauses. It is obligatory in head-final relative clauses. If ''kai'' is not present in the sentence, the sentence becomes ungrammatical, as demonstrated by example #52. Pontianak Teochew does not allow the use of the Malaysian relativizer ''yang''. When this relativizer is present, the sentence becomes ungrammatical. This is shown in example #53.

 47) ''Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
       Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
       ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 48) ''*Aling phaʔ nongkiǎ khau.''
       Aling hit child cry
       ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 49) ''*'''yang''' Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
       '''REL''' Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
       ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

===Ute===
[[Colorado River Numic language|Ute]] is a language that belongs to the Northern Division of the [[Uto-Aztecan]] language family that spans the distance from the Rocky Mountains to Popocatepetl volcano south of Mexico City.

In Ute, relative clauses that modify the subject are introduced in a different manner than those that modify the object. In both cases, there is no overt relativizer morpheme, rather [[nominalization]] and [[Grammatical case|case]] morphology are used to introduce relative clauses.

For example, nominalizing suffixes are attached to verbal elements in subject relative clauses.

 50) '''áapachi 'u [sivaatuchi 'uway paqha-puga-tu]''
      boy.SU 3s.SU  goat.O    3s.O  kill-REM-NOM
      The boy who killed the goat

In relative clauses that are introduced as arguments to an object, the verbal elements are inflected with nominalizing morphology similar to that of their subject relative clause counterparts and the subject of the embedded clause is inflected with the [[genitive]] case.

 51) ''po'oqwatu 'uru [na'achichi 'uway po'o-na]-y punikya-qha-n''
       book.O    the.O girl.GEN  3s.GEN write-NOM-O see-ANT-1s
       I saw the book that the girl is writing

'''''Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought''''' is a 2001 book by [[Cognitive anthropology|cognitive anthropologist]] [[Pascal Boyer]], in which the author discusses the [[evolutionary psychology of religion]] and [[evolutionary origin of religions]].

==Synopsis==
Boyer describes the genesis of religious concepts as a phenomenon of the mind's [[cognitive]] [[inference]] systems, comparable to [[pareidolia]] and [[perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena]] resulting from [[face perception]] processes within the [[human brain]]. Boyer supports this naturalistic origin of religion with evidence from many specialized disciplines including [[biological anthropology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[cognitive science]], [[linguistics]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[information processing]].

''Religion Explained'' frames religious practices and beliefs in terms of recent [[cognitive neuroscience]] research in the [[modularity of mind]]. This theory involves cognitive "modules" ("devices" or "subroutines") underlying inference systems and intuitions. For instance, Boyer suggests culturally-widespread beliefs in "supernatural agents" (e.g., gods, ancestors, spirits, and witches) result from [[agent detection]]: the intuitive modular process of assuming intervention by conscious agents, regardless of whether they are present. "When we see branches moving in a tree or when we hear an unexpected sound behind us, we immediately infer that some agent is the cause of this salient event. We can do that without any specific description of what the agent actually is."&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 2001:144,&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer cites [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]]'s classic [[Zande people|Zande]] story about a termite-infested roof collapsing.
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the anthropologist, the house caved in because of the termites. For the Zande, it was quite clear that witchcraft was involved. However, the Zande were also aware that the termites were the proximate cause of the incident. But what they wanted to know was why it happened at that particular time, when particular people were gathered in the house.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, 2001:196, cf. 2001:12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within Boyer's hypothesis, religion is a "parasite" (or "[[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]") offshoot from cognitive modules, comparable to the way the [[Reading (process)|reading]] process is parasitic upon [[language module]]s.
&lt;blockquote&gt;As I have pointed out repeatedly the building of religious concepts requires mental systems and capacities that are there anyway, religious concepts or not. Religious morality uses moral intuitions, religious notions of supernatural agents recruit our intuitions about agency in general, and so on. This is why I said that religious concepts are parasitic upon other mental capacities. Our capacities to play music, paint pictures or even make sense of printed ink-patterns on a page are also parasitic in this sense. This means that we can explain how people play music, paint pictures and learn to read by examining how mental capacities are recruited by these activities. The same goes for religion. Because the concepts require all sorts of specific human capacities (an intuitive psychology, a tendency to attend to some counterintuitive concepts, as well as various social mind adaptations), we can explain religion by describing how these various capacities get recruited, how they contribute to the features of religion that we find in so many different cultures. We do not need to assume that there is a special way of functioning that occurs only when processing religious thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, 2001:311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Boyer admits his explanation of religion 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is ''not'' a quick, shoot-from-the-hip solution of the kind that many people, either religious or not, seem to favor. There cannot be a magic bullet to explain the existence and common features of religion, as the phenomenon is the result of ''aggregate relevance'' – that is, of successful activation of a whole variety of mental systems.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 2001:298, italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reviews and criticisms==
{{summarize section|date=January 2011}}
Critical reception of ''Religion Explained'' has been mixed.

[[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]], a professor of developmental psychology at the [[University of Haifa]], called the book "a milestone on the road to a new behavioral understanding of religion, basing itself on what has come to be known as cognitive anthropology, and pointedly ignoring much work done over the past one hundred years in the behavioral study of religion and in the psychological anthropology of religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/02/boyer.html Book Review: Religion Explained] ''Human Nature Review'' 2002 Volume 2: 308–309 (22 July)&lt;/ref&gt; 
He continues: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The clearest virtue of this book is that of dealing with the real thing. Even today, most scholarly work on religion consists of apologetics in one form or another, and we are deluged by offers of grants to study "spirituality" or teach "religion and science". This all serves to make us forget that religion is a collection of fantasies about spirits, and Boyer indeed aims to teach us about the world of the spirits in the grand tradition of the Enlightenment. Any general introduction to the world of the spirits must be ambitious because it hasn't been done and also because it has been done intuitively by all of us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Klinghoffer]], a journalist and [[intelligent design]] proponent, wrote in the ''[[National Review]]'' that "Boyer's talk of 'religion is suspiciously generic" and describes his work as "professorial noodlings" that attempt to raise the question whether "all religions are somehow the same". He further claims that "debunkers like Boyer ... have their own unconscious motivations (to undermine religious faith, after all, is to set oneself free of its many inconvenient strictures)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080421220616/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_19_53/ai_78692094/pg_2 Faith no more—Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought—Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]], founder of [[The Skeptics Society]], described Boyer's book as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a penetratingly insightful scientific analysis of religion because as an anthropologist he understands that any explanation must take into account the rich diversity of religious practices and beliefs around the world, and as a scientist he knows that any explanatory model must account for this diversity. Boyer is at his ethnographic best in describing the countless peculiar religious rituals he and his anthropological brethren have recorded, and especially in identifying the shortcomings of virtually every explanation for religion ever offered. … As a consequence, however, Boyer himself fails to provide a satisfactory explanation because he knows that religion is not a single entity resulting from a single cause.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael. 2001. ''How We Believe: Science, Skepticism, and the Search for God'', 2nd ed., Macmillan, p 256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brigitte Schön, a theology professor at the [[University of Bonn]], wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from being fascinating to read and containing many more highly original ideas than could be mentioned here, ''Religion explained'' is an important book for a number of reasons. First of all, Boyer is able to present a very dense network of theories which not only explains many religious phenomena but also sets them in relation to each other. The integration of cognitive science research leads to a very realistic model of how religious concepts are processed and communicated, something which has been conspicuously absent from most theories of religion so far. Boyer's account of the natural basis of religion explains very well the persistence and re-emergence of religion even in a secularized environment, as well as the tensions between official and folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Schön. [http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb03/ivk/mjr/pdfs/2002/reviews/rev_schoen_2002.pdf "''Religion Explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought''"], ''Marburg Journal of Religion'' 2002 7.1:1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Garry Runciman, 3rd Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Garry Runciman]], sociologist at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], asked "Are we hardwired for God?"
&lt;blockquote&gt;The diverse beliefs which Boyer cites extend from Apollo and Athena, to shamanism among the Panamanian Cuna, to aliens from remote galaxies allegedly landing in New Mexico. But his central agenda is the particular set of unobservable causal agencies cited in his subtitle, and his primary concern is with the question of how we are to account for beliefs that involve the attribution of conscious agency to beings other than humans and animals of the normal and familiar kind. Such beliefs are, as Boyer says, remarkably widespread, and for all their variant forms the variation is neither limitless nor random. His answer falls into two parts: first, these beliefs have in common a counterintuitive attribution of a certain range of properties to certain kinds of quasihuman being; second, the explanation of their diffusion and persistence is to be sought not in the extensive anthropological literature about the origins and functions of religion, but in recent advances in developmental, cognitive and evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Runciman. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/feb/07/londonreviewofbooks/print Are we hardwired for God?], ''London Review of Books'', July 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author and economist [[Zachary Karabell]] found stylistic faults. "Boyer's use of cognitive psychology, anthropology and other disciplines does generate a new template for examining old questions. But his method, however compelling, does not save the book from its considerable flaws. To begin with, the writing is frequently impenetrable." He concludes, "Of course, Boyer may be right. Human existence may simply be a story of living, breathing, eating and dying. But by not grappling with the possibility that a nonmaterial realm exists, Boyer has written a book about religion that is occasionally illuminating and utterly unconvincing."&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Karabell. [http://www.rivertwice.com/articles/pdfs/A_True_Believer_%20in_Science_Offers_a_Lopsided_Look_LAT.pdf A True Believer in Science Offers a Lopsided Look at Faith; ''RELIGION EXPLAINED: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought'', By Pascal Boyer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191026/http://www.rivertwice.com/articles/pdfs/A_True_Believer_%20in_Science_Offers_a_Lopsided_Look_LAT.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }}, ''Los Angeles Times'' June 16, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[comparative religion]] author [[Karen Armstrong]] reviewed Boyer's thesis.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion, he argues, is nothing more or less than a by-product of the human mind. It is a side effect of having a particular kind of brain. By far the most fascinating part of this highly accessible and informative book is Boyer's description of the way our minds work. We have an inbuilt set of ontological expectations and a tendency to dwell on intuitions which violate these, such as mountains that float or companions whom we do not see. From the dawn of modern consciousness, men and women have focused on certain imaginary personalities that transcend the norm, convinced that they can help them in strategic ways. These supernatural agents link with other mental systems, such as our moral intuitions and social categories, for which we can find no conceptual justification.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Armstrong, [http://www.asa3.org/archive/asa/200109/0070.html ''Religion Explained'' by Pascal Boyer], ''The Times'', August 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Habgood, Baron Habgood|John Habgood]], formerly [[Archbishop of York]], wrote.
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a bold and far-reaching book. What its author lacks in modesty, he makes up for in cogency of argument and elegance of style. His "explanation" of religion is lucid, entertaining, full of valuable insights and almost, but not quite, convincing. The usual explanations of religion—as an attempt to explain what is otherwise puzzling, as a provider of comfort, as a good thing for society or as an escape from reason—are quickly dismissed. Pascal Boyer seeks to demonstrate that its origins and motivations are more deep seated in our mental structures than any of these, which is why religion is so universal, so powerful and so unlikely to disappear even though, as he also claims, it is in the end only a mental phenomenon. Recent experience of the dreadful consequences of religious fanaticism gives his analysis a frightening contemporary relevance, not least because of the minor role within religion that he assigns to rationality.&lt;ref&gt;John Habgood, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=166258&amp;sectioncode=40 "Parasite of airy nothings?"], ''Times Higher Education'', 14 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Further|Islam and other religions|Divisions of the world in Islam|Islamism}}

[[Muslim]]s believe that [[Islam]] is the original and primordial faith, or [[fitrah]], that was revealed by [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;[Encyclopædia Britannica "Islam"  http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295507/Islam] Accessed July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims maintain that [[Prophets in Islam|previous messages and revelations]] have been [[Tahrif|partially changed or corrupted]] over time&lt;ref name="Distorted"&gt;Accad (2003): According to Ibn Taymiya, although only some Muslims accept the textual veracity of the entire Bible, most Muslims will grant the veracity of most of it.&lt;/ref&gt; and consider the [[Quran]] to be the unaltered and the [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin|final revelation]] from Allah. Religious concepts and practices include the [[Five Pillars of Islam|five pillars of Islam]], which are basic concepts and obligatory acts of worship, and following [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, encompassing everything from [[Islamic banking|banking]] and [[zakāt|welfare]], to [[Islamic military jurisprudence|warfare]] and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002b), p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002b), pp.111, 112, 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Shari'ah | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam began its history with an exclusivist attitude toward [[polytheist]] religions, but an inclusivist attitude toward monotheists, including Christians and Jews. Believers in the oneness of God were given the status of ''[[dhimmi]]'', conferring on them certain rights, including the right to practice their religions openly and not to be pressured to accept [[Islam]]. 

In practice, however, neither the inclusion of Jews and Christians nor militant exclusivism toward "pagans" was always practiced. Trinitarian Christians were accused of [[idolatry]] because of their veneration of [[icon]]s and were also sometimes treated as polytheists because of the doctrines of the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation]]. As strict monotheists, Jews generally fared better than Christians under Islamic rule. Jews and Christians are viewed largely favorably as compared to any other religion.

The basic attitude of Islam toward other religions remains unchanged today, and certain Islamic nations, such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iran]], are more exclusivistic toward other religions than are others, such as [[Indonesia]] and [[Egypt]].

Islam does accept sincere [[Jew]]s, [[Christian]]s, and [[Sabians]] as [[People of the Book|people "of the Book"]] along with [[Muslim]]s.

==Judaism==

Although most Jews are pluralist or inclusivist some [[Jews]] believe that the [[God in Judaism|God]] of [[Abraham]] is the [[Monotheism|one true God]]. The Jews believe the God of Abraham entered into a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with the ancient [[Israelites]], marking them as his [[Jews as the chosen people|Chosen People]], giving them a mission to spread the concept of monotheism. Jews do not consider their chosenness to be a mark of superiority to other nations, but a responsibility to be an example of behavior for other nations to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judaism.about.com/od/judaismbasics/a/jewsaschosenpeople.htm "What Does It Mean For Jews to Be the Chosen People?" Pelaia, Ariela.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
Buddhist religious exclusivism may be seen in the implication that those who do not accept the teachings of the Buddha, such as the [[Eightfold Path]], are destined to repeat the cycle of suffering through endless reincarnations; while those who practice the true way can reach enlightenment. Neo-Buddhist groups sometimes consider their tradition the true path to enlightenment and engage in strong evangelical efforts to influence those they consider to be in darkness. Several sects associated with{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} [[Nichiren Buddhism]] may be included in this category.

However, many followers of [[Eastern religion]]s are not exclusivist. For example, there are millions of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] who would also consider themselves to follow [[Confucianism]] or [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=7154|title=Testing Stark's Thesis:Is Mormonism the First New World Religion since Islam?|author=Gerald R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6419">'''Soft Cost''' is a construction industry term but more specifically a contractor accounting term for an expense item that is not considered direct construction cost. Soft costs include architectural, engineering, financing, and legal fees, and other pre- and post-construction expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soft Cost|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/soft-cost.html|website=Business Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been replaced in most contractor accrual accounting with the term General &amp; Administrative abbreviated G&amp;A.

==Overview==
For a contractor, soft costs are essentially construction costs incurred that are not labor and materials. Delay in Start Up [[insurance]] coverage and soft costs are not the same. Some soft costs may be incurred in the repair of a covered loss before the anticipated completion date is reached. These can be [[architect]] fees or [[engineering]] fees incurred to repair loss or damage to the insured property. Only those [[indirect costs]] that are above what would have been incurred up to the anticipated completion date but continue after such date due to the insured delay are soft costs that are covered by delay in completion or delay in start up coverage. Soft cost is a contractor accounting term for their expenses that are not associated with a particular construction task. Their construction trailer, water delivery, book keepers, etc. are all soft costs that continue on after the original anticipated completion date is reached, if the project is delayed. Only if the delay was caused by an insured loss would the insurance pick these expenses up, and only if the policy includes delay in start up coverage. Any repair costs which are not labor or materials and are indemnified to complete the repair of property loss should not be reported under delay in completion and there is no delay in completion until the anticipated date of completion is reached, and the project is not finished.  Not all indirect costs are time related expenses that continue after the original date of completion. Those soft costs (indirect costs) which are continuing fixed expenses that continue because the project is delayed by an insured loss are soft costs that should be included with the delay in start up values. A soft cost to a [[General contractor|contractor]], such as his administration costs, can be a hard cost to the owner because what the contractor invoices the owner is the owner's direct cost. If the owner employs engineers to overlook construction as the project is executed, this will be a continuing expense during repair if the repair is done after the original completion date and would be reported in the delay in completion values. If the engineer cost was a one time charge for a design, he may need to be consulted in order for the loss to be repaired. This expense does not occur because of a delay, but is incurred to repair property damage and hence should be included in the construction costs if the intention is for that expense to be covered in the indemnification depending on policy wording. If the project is insured to the extent of the reported values, and that value was left out to compute the premium, the company may decline that cost in the indemnification.

Soft costs differ from [[Building_material#The_total_cost_of_building_materials|hard costs]] in both labor and materials; they are generally not considered to be exclusively related to physical construction. Rather, they are commonly perceived to entail non-construction costs such as [[taxes]], [[marketing]] expenses, [[interest]] payments, and finance charges. The soft costs endorsement provided in the Builders’ Risk section of the AAIS Inland Marine Guide lists 10 types of soft costs: advertising, design fees, professional fees, financing, lease administration, realty taxes, general administration, lease expenses, permit fees, and insurance premiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soft Costs, Hard Concept|url=http://www.aaisonline.com/AAISFrame/ConnectFrame/ViewpointFrame/tabid/108/ArticleID/352/Soft-Costs-Hard-Concept.aspx|website=AAIS|publisher=Viewpoint Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a solution to the problem has emerged in the form of Delay in Opening coverage which can be provided in [[Builder's risk insurance|Builder's Risk Insurance]]. This coverage can provide [[indemnification]] for these indirect costs that may continue after the original completion date. Other soft costs that can be repeated in the repair of the property should be reported with the property values. A Draw Back expense proforma shows which soft costs are one time charges and which are continuing expenses throughout the project term. Engineer design fee is a one time charge that can be incurred again in a repair whereas engineer oversight of quality persists through the term and after.
Unfortunately, these contractor accounting terms are being used when the owner is insured and many have erroneously equated hard costs with property and soft costs with business interruption which is called Delay in Opening&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soft Cost or Delay in Opening: Insure for the Potential Exposure|url=http://adjustersinternational.com/publications/adjusting-today/soft-cost-or-delay-in-opening/0/|website=Adjusting Today|publisher=Adjusters International}}&lt;/ref&gt; coverage being added to some builder's risk policies. With its popularity increasing in recent years, some insurers automatically include soft costs coverage, which can be activated by designating the limit on policy declarations. However, these modifications to builder's risk insurance will not cover the efficiency of business owners or managers. Soft costs can also refer to the failure of implementing a strategy in a timely manner, or the [[opportunity cost]] of delaying a solution to a problem for discussion or consideration. For this reason, it is important to understand that soft costs can refer to unforeseen construction costs (lost screws, damaged equipment), physical labor (task takes longer than expected, losing a key team member), or time wasted on strategy implementation (taking too long to decide a course of action).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Jeremy|title=Uncover the Soft Costs of Doing Business|url=http://contractingbusiness.com/feature/cb_imp_5711|website=Contracting Business|accessdate=2003-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1816">'''"Sudbury Saturday Night"''' is one of the most famous songs by [[Stompin' Tom Connors]], which depicts the hard-drinking, hard-partying social life of [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock miners]] in the [[Northern Ontario]] mining city of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Gillian|title=The North American Folk Music Revival: Nation and Identity in the United States and Canada, 1945-1980|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2007|page=158|isbn=978-0-7546-5756-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtVapc9Nt8kC&amp;pg=PA158}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The song's chorus is:
: ''Yeah, the girls are out to [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]]
: ''And the boys are gettin' [[drunkenness|stinko]]
: ''And we'll think no more of [[CVRD Inco|Inco]]
: ''On a Sudbury Saturday night''

Originally released on Connors' 1967 debut album ''The Northlands' Own Tom Connors'', the song also reappeared on his 1972 album ''Bud the Spud'', his live album ''Live at the Horseshoe'', the compilations ''A Proud Canadian'' and ''25 of the Best Stompin' Tom Souvenirs'', and the 1995 rerelease of ''The Northlands' Own Tom Connors'' under the title ''Northlands Zone''.

"Sudbury Saturday Night" was covered by Canadian musician [[Kim Mitchell]] in 1998 on the compilation ''[[Summer Dock Party]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LeBlanc|first=Larry|date=1998-07-11|title=New Discs Feature Vintage Pop|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|volume=110|issue=28|pages=48|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-AkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 10 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; known as "Madame Documentation,"&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. "Suzanne Briet, 1894-1989: 'Madame Documentation'." http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/briet.html. Retrieved 10 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; was a librarian, author, historian, poet, and visionary best known for her treatise ''Qu'est-ce que la documentation?'' (''What is Documentation?''), a foundational text in the modern study of [[information science]]. She is also known for her writings on the history of [[Ardennes]] and the poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R. E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her treatise ''Qu'est-ce que la documentation?'' offers a vision of documentation that moves beyond [[Paul Otlet]]'s emphasis on fixed forms of documents, such as the book, toward "an unlimited horizon of physical forms and aesthetic formats for documents and an unlimited horizon of techniques and technologies (and of 'documentary agencies' employing these) in the service of multitudes of particular cultures."&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "Preface." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many early [[Information science#European documentation|European Documentalists]], Briet embraced [[modernism|modernity]] and [[science]].&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; However, her work made a difference to modernism and science through the influence of [[French people|French]] [[post-structuralist]] theorists and her strong orientation toward humanistic scholarship. She subsequently ushered in a second generation of European Documentation and introduced humanistic methods and concerns, especially [[semiotics]] and [[cultural studies]], to [[information science]].&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in ''What Is Documentation?''." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Briet had been highly regarded throughout much of her career—the Grand Cross of the [[Légion d'honneur]] was conferred on her in 1950 — she was largely forgotten in her later life, until her death in 1989, when scholars found a renewed interest in her ideas. Today scholars often credit Briet as a visionary, having laid the foundation for contemporary frameworks and methodologies in information science roughly 50 years earlier. "Her modernist perspective," writes [[Michael Buckland]], "combined with semiotics, deserves attention now because it is different from, and offers an alternative to, the scientific, [[Positivism|positivist]] view that has so dominated information science and which is increasingly questioned."&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R. E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Suzanne Briet was born in [[Paris]], [[France]] on 1 February 1894, coming of age at a time of great social change and economic loss in France after [[World War I]]. Although Briet grew up in [[Paris]], she remained attached to her birthplace and ancestral home. Briet was only 20 at the outbreak of the war. Ardennes was the pathway of German armies invading France, and during the hostilities her uncle was deported, his village was invaded, and her grandfather's house was destroyed. Historians have suggested that perhaps because of her experiences during the war, as well as her travels to [[England]] as a child, Briet took an early interest in the [[League of Nations]], sitting in on some of the sessions held in Paris, and the founding of other international organizations.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; Briet's mother expected her to become a teacher. Briet's family sent her to Ecole de Sèvres, an elite women's school for training secondary school teachers, where she earned a degree in history and qualified to teach English and history. After teaching in Algeria from 1917 to 1920, Briet pursued a career in librarianship.&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 1"&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; She studied with Louis Barrau-Dihigo at the [[Sorbonne]], who was apparently so taken with Briet's talents that "when Briet explained that she could only participate on Saturday, he changed the time of the course to accommodate her."&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; At age 30 in 1924, Briet was one of the first of three women appointed as professional librarians at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]].&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 1"/&gt;

==Career==
Briet's career at the Bibliothèque  Nationale witnessed major changes in the library profession. Briet played a central role in the "modern library" movement, which eschewed elitist traditions that had dominated many libraries in favor of "modern" ideas of librarianship. In addition to technological innovations, Briet saw the emergence of documentation as a distinct profession with its own techniques, standards and training.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; Women also entered the professional classes in France in increasing numbers during [[World War II]], growing from only 10% of the library profession in 1927 to 50% by the end of the war.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; Her main achievements during these years were symbolic of her interest in service and moderninzation. Between 1934 and 1954, Briet created and supervised the Salle des Catalogues et Bibliographies, making available materials throughout France that had been previously restricted to most patrons. By 1931 she co-founded (with chemist [[Jean Gérard]]) the Union Française des Organismes de Documentation, the French analogue of the American Documentation Institution, today known as the [[American Society for Information Science and Technology]].

During [[World War II]], Briet witnessed many of her colleagues deported during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of Paris]] and others arrested as communists. Despite a climate of fear, censorship, oppression and physical hardship, Briet made sure to carry out the catalog and bibliographic services of the Bibliothèque  Nationale. During the war, Briet continued her interest in Documentation, even attending a conference in [[Salzburg]], [[Germany]], which was organized by German Documentalists.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; At the end of the war, Briet took on a larger role in a growing international documentation movement. In 1950, she prepared an international survey of education for librarians and documentalists commissioned by [[UNESCO]] and was awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]]. In 1951 Briet helped establish the Institut National de Techniques de la Documentation at the [[Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers]]. She was the founding Director of Studies and eventually the Vice-President of the [[International Federation for Documentation]].

That same year, Briet published her treatise ''Qu'est-ce que la documentation?'', in which she outlines, in 48 pages, her philosophy of documentation, "pushing boundaries of the field beyond texts to include any material form of evidence. ('Is a living animal a document?' she asked.)"&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 2"&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Her thirty-year career at the Bibliothèque  Nationale often put Briet in close contact with major French thinkers of the day, including scientists, historians, linguists, and philosophers, which had a significant impact on her philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "Preface." In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  Briet retired from the Bibliothèque  Nationale in 1954 at age 60. She wrote her last essays on documentation in 1955.&lt;ref name="people.ischool.berkeley.edu"&gt;Buckland, Michael. "Checklist of Writings" http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/Brietwebbib.pdf Retrieved 10 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She spent her retirement concentrating on other interests, including the history of [[Ardennes]] and the poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]]. Her memoirs were published in 1979.&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 2"/&gt; She died in [[Boulogne]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt;

==Impact on information science==
Briet published roughly 100 essays, books, and reports on documentation, [[library science]], and [[history]]&lt;ref name="people.ischool.berkeley.edu"/&gt; She took up many of the pressing issues of documentation in her day: [[internationalization]], [[institutionalization]], [[information overload|information or documentary overload]], [[scholarly communication]], [[science and technology studies]], [[world peace]], and [[international development]]. Briet had been deeply engaged in the documentation movement from the 1920s onward, bringing to it a deep understanding of culture and the humanities. Expanding on the techniques and technological ideas of earlier European Documentalists, such as [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]], "Briet understood that technology and culture were deeply connected. She saw society and, therefore, culture, as being re-shaped by technology. The techniques of documentation in aiding and shaping intellectual work were, in her view, both a symptom of, and contributing force within the 'industrialization' of knowledge workers. We can now see, in the impact of computers and telecommunications, how right she was."&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As one scholar notes, "Not again -- until [[Actor-network theory]] at the end of the twentieth century -- would a social network account of technical production, and specifically, documentary production, be articulated."&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in What Is Documentation?." In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Briet's body of work points to the necessity to understand cultural categories, historical lineages, and the social forces that create and sustain information, urging scholars and information professionals to explore beyond the boundaries of their cultural specialization. Paul Otlet problematized the definition of document when he opened the possibility of any object, independent of the human intention behind its creation, to be a considered a document. Briet solves this problem with her argument that a document must be defined by its intentional use as such. She gives the example of an antelope -- running wild in the plains, it is not a document, but captured and placed in a zoo, it becomes an object of study and thus a document. It operates, as Briet says it must, as “evidence in support of a fact”.&lt;ref&gt;"What is a 'document'?" Journal of the American Society for Information Science 48, no. 9 (Sept 1997): 804-809.&lt;/ref&gt; An object’s treatment as evidence is contingent not only on its own properties but on its very framing as a source of information. It must be organized into a meaningful relationship with other evidence in order to have the indexical power of evidence.

According to one scholar, "One of Briet's most important insights was that individual documents may be interpreted in different ways by different people wishing to put them to different uses for different purposes. This variability of interpretation is characteristic of documents even at the level of individual words, and the different decisions made by different translators at the word level can have significant consequences."&lt;ref&gt;Furner, Jonathan. (2008). "Review: What Is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. By Suzanne Briet. Translated and edited by Ronald E. Day and Laurent Martinet with Hermina G. B. Anghelescu." Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record 43.1, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Briet developed the notion of ''indice'' (literally "index") as not only pointing to an object but also reflective of the networks in which that object appears as a named thing, leading to a semiotics-inspired definition of "document." Furthermore, Briet argued that techniques and technologies are expressions of a networked culture. One scholar explains the idea this way: "Information and communication technologies may introduce a 'new rhythm' to society and culture, but they themselves are a "symptom" of Western social development."&lt;ref name="Day, Ronald 2006 p. 55"&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in What Is Documentation?." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, technique and technology are historically specific and symptomatic of culture. Briet argues that documentation must respond by incorporating these symptoms and specificities of Western culture but also must incorporate "Western modernity's opposite trend toward global expansion."&lt;ref name="Day, Ronald 2006 p. 55"/&gt; Briet also saw knowledge as embedded and emergent in cultural and social production and saw modernity as the growth of networks of knowledge. Indeed, in an increasingly globalized world, Briet argued for documentation to take up the call of material necessity rather than be put into the service of culture or any one culture; that is, "documentation marks the importance of particular, more 'localized' or specialized cultures in terms of their material needs, their specialized vocabularies, and the techniques and technologies needed to provide documentary services to these groups."&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in What Is Documentation?." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Oprah Effect''' is the phenomenon in which consuming [[soft news]] causes the politically unaware to vote more consistently with their own views, articulated by Matthew A. Baum and Angela S. Jamison in their 2006 study, "''The Oprah Effect: How Soft News Helps Inattentive Citizens Vote Consistently''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/mbaum/documents/OprahEffect_JOP.pdf|author=Matthew Baum and Angels Jamison|title=The ''Oprah'' Effect: How Soft News Helps Inattentive Citizens Vote Consistently|publisher=The Journal of Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings and conclusions of the study centered around the distinction between hard and soft news as written about by Baum, and the complex interactions both types of news have on people with low and high political awareness. The term was pioneered by [[Oprah Winfrey]].

The increase of soft news content available has led some scholars to question its value in informing the public, and therefore question whether the media is properly fulfilling its duty to inform the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=Thomas|title=The Search for a Standard: Markets and the Media|journal=Political Communication|date=2003|volume=20|pages=139–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeller|first1=John|title=A New Standard of News Quality: Burglar Alarms for the Monitorial Citizen|journal=Political Communication|date=2003|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oprah Effect was demonstrated by testing a dependent variable of voting consistently versus an independent variable which measured how often the voter watched daytime talk shows. Voting consistency measures the consistency between a voter's preferences and their vote. For the context of this experiment, the measure of voting consistently was created by applying Lau and Redlawsk's model of "correct" voting to data from the 2000 [[American National Election Studies|National Election Studies]]. Increased consumption of soft news caused low information voters to vote more consistently, but had no significant effect on more aware voters. Exposure to hard news modestly increased the voting consistency of politically aware individuals, but had no significant effect on those with low political awareness.

While Baum and Jamison agree that soft news contains lower quality political information, they conclude from their analysis that soft news fulfills a valuable duty by providing information to apolitical individuals. This is because soft news still exposes those individuals to the political information that they need to cast a vote for the candidate which best reflects their personal interests, even if it doesn't contain highly complex political information. They theorize that exposure to soft news has this effect on low information individuals because most people with little political knowledge have no interest in harder news, making their decision to consume soft news one between  consuming soft news or consuming no news. Even though soft news may not be highly informational, it's still beneficial compared to consuming no news. They also go even further, contending that even if an individual with little political knowledge were to consume hard news, the more complex political information would be difficult for them to comprehend, and they would get relatively little out of it. As a result, they conclude their results should give some pause to critics of the increase soft news content in the media, because it increases the voting consistency of those with little political knowledge.

The '''Thomas-Institut''' is a research Institute whose function it is to serve the study of medieval philosophy by preparing critical editions and historical and systematic studies of medieval authors.

==General information==
The Thomas-Institut was founded in 1950 by Josef Koch, then Professor for medieval philosophy at the [[University of Cologne]]. Forming part of the Faculty of Humanities and, more particularly, the [http://www.philosophie.uni-koeln.de Philosophy Department], the Thomas-Institut is a research Institute whose function it is to serve the study of medieval philosophy by preparing critical editions and historical and systematic studies of medieval authors. The director of the Institute is the professor holding the chair in [[medieval philosophy]] at the university.

Since communicating the results of this work is an essential part of the task of the Institute, the staff gives various courses in medieval philosophy at the University of Cologne. Jointly with twenty other departments - from History and Philology to Byzantine, Jewish and Islamic Studies - the Thomas-Institute organizes an extensive programme for medieval studies, the Zentrum für Mittelalterstudien ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070813081645/http://www.zfms.uni-koeln.de/ ZfMs]).

Since its beginnings the Thomas-Institut has attached importance to international cooperation and exchange, and many of the projects pursued at the Thomas-Institut are international collaborations. The Mediaevistentagung, taking place every two years, has become one of the foremost conferences on medieval studies in Europe, furthering international and interdisciplinary research. The proceedings are published in the Miscellanea Mediaevalia series, edited by the Institute and published by de Gruyter.

In addition to its own projects the Thomas-Institut sponsors several ongoing editions which are funded and organized by other institutions. The most important at present are the [[Averroes]] Latinus project of the International Union of Academies, funded by the Nordrhein-Westfäische Akademie der Wissenschaften, and the critical edition of the works of Nicolaus [[Cusanus]] with the Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften. The Thomas-Institut likewise participates in the [[Aristoteles]] Latinus project organized by the International Union of Academies, it hosts the [[Meister Eckhart]] Archiv and has recently started the critical edition of [[Durandus of St. Pourçain]].

Since its beginnings the Thomas-Institut has edited the Studien und Texte zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters (STGMA) published by Brill, one of the most renowned series in medieval philosophy and medieval studies. In 1997, together with the [http://www.hiw.kuleuven.be De Wulf-Mansion Centre in Leuven], the Thomas-Institut took over the journal Recherches de Théologie et Philosophie médiévales.

== Research ==

=== Main areas of expertise ===
* Conditions of Scientific Discourse in Medieval Arabic, Hebrew, Byzantine and Latin Culture

Scientific discourse in the Middle Ages has its common ground in the reception of Greek learning from late Antiquity. It is diversified, however, according to the sociological and institutional as well as religious and theological framework in which Greek science is integrated. Besides that, the processes of rationalisation taking place in various fields of knowledge exercise a considerable influence. Key-words like "Reception of [[Dionysus|Dionysius]]", "Reception of [[Aristotle]]", and "[[Averroism]]" refer us to a complex structure of medieval bodies of knowledge. This structure has to be understood as the result of far-reaching processes of reception and transformation, transmission and translation. Inquiries in this area demand a combination of philosophical, philological, and historiographical competences. Research at the Thomas-Institut focuses on the contexts of transmission, on the attempts to define the meaning of "philosophy" (for example in the relationship of "Philosophy and Wisdom"), and on the formation of [[epistemology|epistemological]] and institutional canons.

* Intellect, Mind and Soul: Concepts, Stratifications and Boundaries. A Critical Evaluation of the Medieval Debates

The debate on intellect, mind and soul is currently one of those philosophical topics generating the most innovative questions. Medieval philosophy is of central importance in this respect, since it furnishes a rich tradition of investigation in this area. The problem was dealt with in all the medieval philosophical and theological cultures and languages. While differences abounded in every milieu, some solutions were adopted across boundaries. The medieval contribution is interesting from the point of view of the history of ideas, but the reception of traditions from Antiquity also engendered new theories. The confrontation of these theories in epistemological debates from the 13th century to the Renaissance lead to the development of new models. One may think for instance of "augustinisme avicennisant", the Averroistic theory of intellect, and the combination of Aristotelian and [[pseudo-Dionysian]] noetics. When one examines the modern debate on the background just sketched, it becomes clear that medieval philosophy provides models and perspectives both richer in arguments and truly interdisciplinary. This topic has already been made the object of research by an international network of institutions working on medieval philosophy (the [http://www.egsamp.uni-koeln.de EGSAMP] members Leuven, Amsterdam, Pisa, Lecce, Bari, Sofia) in which the Thomas-Institut participates.

=== Ongoing Research Projects ===
* The Relationship between Philosophy and Wisdom
** Philosophy and Wisdom in the Middle Ages
A Contribution to the Development of the Western Concept of Philosophy
Behind the terminological opposition of philosophy and wisdom, into whose reasons this project enquires, emerges another problem: the origin of philosophy. Thus the medieval debate is representative of a basic discourse, which always anew attempts to determine the essence of philosophy. The Middle Ages, and especially the 13th century are of prime importance for the reconstruction of the affaire de cœur of philosophy and wisdom. In the second half of this century the reception of an Aristotelian idea of philosophical wisdom sparks a major controversy about the identity of philosophy, a controversy that presages many of the questions asked in the modern era. The results which have been reached in a number of case-studies will be assembled and assessed in context.

** "Rhizomatics": the Art of Living and Wisdom as Bridges for a Transcultural Philosophy 
In this project "rhizomatics" and nomadism as developed by the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari are employed to address transcultural issues. At the heart of this project are the concept of philosophy, its relation to wisdom, methodology and ethics and possible forms and constructions of philosophy. Besides the French and German Literature on Deleuze the project will take into account the reception and resonance of his ideas in Spanish-American thought.

** New Perspectives in the Historiography of Medieval Philosophy 
What is medieval philosophy? This question has been answered in a variety of ways even before Gilson's influential attempts to give a definitive reply. Such answers are always bound up with a certain idea of philosophy and its resulting mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion. But if one takes into account the dynamics proper to different cultural frameworks which transferred the philosophical inheritance from late Antiquity into modernity, one must try to describe its interactions more closely, disregarding the classical narratives of medieval philosophy. In order to realise this, new methodological approaches will be attempted. This project forms part of the InterLink-project (Bari-Köln-Sofia-Leuven-Paris) "Soggetto e statuto della filosofia nel Medioevo. Nuove prospettive di ricerca nell'edizione critica dei testi e nelle metodologie di indagine storiografica".

* Thomas Aquinas in Philosophical Context
** Thomas Aquinas, In librum Beati Dionysii De divinis nominibus expositione, Book IV, Lectiones 1-10 
Thomas Aquinas's commentary on Dionysius is an exemplary case for the study of the encounter of the Latin and the Byzantine Middle Ages. Of special interest are Thomas's first ten "Lectiones" on the fourth book of his model. Here, central themes of [[Neoplatonism]] are treated: the Good, light, beauty, and love. A translation and commentary on the basis of a revised Latin text is in preparation.

** Edith Stein's Translations of Aquinas's Works De veritate and De ente et essentia 
Edith Stein's translations of Aquinas are not only an important document for the intellectual development of Husserl's former assistant but also show in an exemplary case the encounter of Neoscholasticism and modern philosophy at the beginning of the 20th century. In the framework of the new edition of the works of Edith Stein her translation of the Quaestiones disputatae de veritate and her yet unpublished translation of De ente et essential will be edited alongside a number of further "Thomistica" ([http://www.herder.de/theologie/programm/edith_stein/index_html?par_onl_struktur=704728&amp;onl_struktur=704736 ESGA 24]). 
** Thomas Aquinas, Quaestio disputata "De libero arbitrio" (De malo VI) 
This text is a key to understanding Aquinas's teaching on free choice as foundation of truly human, that is to say responsible and autonomous action. A German translation of this text on the basis of the Editio Leonina is currently in preparation and will be published, together with an extensive introduction, by Reclam.

* The Medieval Theory of Transcendentals 
The project is dedicated to the historical development of the theory of transcendentals from its formation in the thirteenth century (Philip the Chancellor) up to its treatment in the Disputationes metaphysicae by Francesco Suárez. It likewise deals with the significance of the theory of transcendentals for medieval philosophy in general.

* The "Super"-Transcendental and the Splitting of Metaphysics 
In search of the origins and motives of the splitting of metaphysics in the 17th and 18th century into a ''metaphysica generalis'' and ''metaphysica specialis'', conceived for the first time by [[Francis of Marchia]] at the beginning of the 14th century, this project enquires into the relationship between the first object of the human intellect and the proper object of metaphysics as they present themselves in conceptions of metaphysics after the time of Duns Scotus. Especially the attempt to define the primum obiectum intellectus as "super-transcendental" has a constitutive function for the legitimating of a twofold metaphysics.

* Radicalisation in lieu of Abolition of the Science of Being. On the Development of First Philosophy from the Late Middle Ages to the 18th Century 
According to the account of the development of first philosophy predominant today, this discipline underwent a transformation since the late Middle Ages, in the course of which the Aristotelian theory of being was dissolved and reformed as an onto-logic of that which can be thought, thus immediately preparing Kant's transcendental philosophy. This interpretation needs to be revised in order to show that the said transformation did not exceed the boundaries of the traditional concept of science. On the contrary, in the teachings of the main representatives of the discipline up to Wolff and Baumgarten one finds a new concept of the theory of being as a theory of the universal and necessary structure of reality which is common to God and every possible world. Thus we do not encounter abolition but rather a radicalisation of tendencies which have shaped the development of first philosophy since the medieval reception of Aristotle and his Arabic interpreters. These tendencies are: the turn from a theological to an ontological concept of first philosophy, from its conception as practical wisdom to the idea of a universal theoretical science, from transcendent being as the starting point of thought to the transcategorical and thus transcendental content of being as such.

* Master Eckhart: Historical and Systematical Perspectives 
As part of the research on the medieval theory of transcendentia, this project examines the peculiar form which the theory of transcendentals takes in Meister Eckhart. The project attempts at the same time to reconstruct Eckhart's Opus propositionum, especially the 9th tractate: "De natura superioris, et inferioris eius oppositi".

* A Mystical Treatise between Convention and Provocation - Possibilities and Limits of Expression in the "Theologia deutsch" ("The Francfurt") 
The treatise written in the 14th century which became popular in the 16th under the title Theologia deutsch, has been considered in scholarship mainly from two perspectives: on the one hand as a key text of the Reformation - it was first edited by Martin Luther - on the other hand as a document of timeless Christian spirituality that can inspire and direct even the life of modern readers. Both approaches have invested the Theologia deutsch with an aura which obfuscates its specific theologico-philosophical profile. Originally it was an anonymous treatise from the context of the so-called "German Mysticism" of the 14th century, transmitted in only a few manuscripts. This is where the planned investigation begins: Disregarding its reception during the Reformation, the Theologia deutsch is examined it its original formative context and thus as a mystical treatise of a special type, which does not at all transmit a timeless spirituality but rather - like other Latin and colloquial texts - sounds out possibilities of expression. The study centres on the Christology and the doctrine of God of the Theologia deutsch. Besides that it discusses - since according to the prologue the author was an anonymous Knight of the German Order from Francfurt - the problems of authorship, authority, and authenticity.

* [[William of Auxerre]], Summa de officiis ecclesiasticis, *[http://ti-intern.uni-koeln.de/sdoe/ First Critical Edition in Digital Format]
In the beginnings of the University of Paris around the year 1200 the Magister William of Auxerre wrote his explanation of liturgy which attempts to elucidate all the cultic-ritual actions and objects of Christian liturgy and to suggest their hidden meaning. The edition of the yet unpublished Summa de officiis ecclesiasticis makes use of the possibilities of digital data processing and further develops in this medium the methodological standards and formats of presentation established for printed editions. The edition is accompanied by a study on the concept of time which forms the basis of William's interpretation of the liturgy and according to which several levels of time and meaning become intertwined during the ritual.

* Ibn Bâjja's Kitâb al-nafs: The First Western Commentary on the De anima 
Ibn Bâjja (ob. 1139), known to the Latin scholastics as "Avempace", was - as the predecessor of Averroes - the first Spanish-Arabic philosopher to comment in a systematical manner upon the writings of Aristotle. Thus he prepared the work of "the Commentator" with respect to both method and content. This is true especially in the field of psychology and the doctrine of intellect where Ibn Bâjja, as a follower of Alexander of Aphrodisias and Alfarabi, formed an Aristotelian counterbalance to the psychology of Avicenna, which was more strongly influenced by Neoplatonism and by the medical tradition. With the preparation of the critical edition and German translation of the Kitâb al-nafs Ibn Bâjja's most central writing on psychology shall be rendered accessible in a reliable form supplemented with guides to its sources. The edition will be accompanied by a study which - for the first time - examines in detail the philosophical questions and solutions of this early period of the reception of De anima. It enquires into the conceptual and historical background of problems like the concept of intention (ma'nâ) or the so-called "conjunction with the Active Intellect" - ideas which came to exercise a longstanding and varied influence.

* "The Birth of a World". Investigations into Themes in the Thought of Michel Foucault 
Starting from an analysis of the opposition of truth and fiction dictated by the traditional idea of philosophy and science, and an examination of the concomitant confrontation of philosophy and science on the one hand and literature on the other hand this study investigates the peculiar status which Michel Foucault gives to the concept of knowledge. This concept of knowledge corresponds in Foucault's writings to a specific concept of fiction in a way that has yet to be clearly defined. To this end Foucault's early texts (apparently dismissed by him later), the long Binswanger-introduction (1954), and the Archéologie du savoir are all searched for a motif which can be called - employing an expression by Foucault himself - the "Birth of a World". The investigation into this theme renders visible elements of "structure" and "history". In the course of this reading the evolution of the foundational thought-structures leading to Foucault's specific concept of knowledge will be examined.

=== Edition Projects ===
* The Commentary on the Sentences by Durandus of St. Pourçain (a S. Porciano) 
As J. Koch has shown, the commentary on the Sentences by Durandus of St. Pourçain (1275–1334) is preserved in three recensions. While the last redaction was printed in the 16th century, the first two versions remain unpublished. Of particular interest is the first, because it contains the sharpest polemic against Thomas Aquinas and because it engendered the most critical response by his contemporaries (such as Petrus de Palude and Petrus Aureoli). In the first place a computerised copy of the third version will be made, which can serve as an effective research instrument. The project centres, nevertheless, on the critical edition of the first version which will be made on the basis of a complete collation of all manuscripts.

* Critical Edition of the Commentaries on Book V and VI of the Nicomachean Ethics in the Latin Translation by Robert Grosseteste 
The project consists in the study of the Latin reception of the commentaries on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics composed and assembled in twelfth century Constantinople at the initiative of Princess Anna Comnena. The critical edition of the texts of the commentaries on book V (Anonymous and [[Michael of Ephesus]]) and book VI ([[Eustratius of Nicaea]]) will complete Mercken's edition of the commentaries on books I-IV (CLCAG 6.1) and VII-X (CLCAG 6.3). The edition of the text will be introduced by a study of the sources of the Greek original text and its Latin reception in the thirteenth and fourteenth century.

* Averroes: Collected Works 
The Latin translation of three of the most important works of Averroes, the Long Commentaries on De caelo, Physica, and Metaphysica, will be edited and published in the series "Bibliotheca" affiliated with the Recherches de Théologie et Philosophie médiévales. This "editio minor" is based on the early printings and some few manuscripts. It is further intended to make these commentaries eventually available on CD-Rom. The edition of the Long Commentary on De caelo on the basis of F. Carmody's edition, revised by R. Arnzen, has already been published. At the moment the edition of the Long Commentary on the Metaphysica (by Dag N. Hasse, Würzburg) and of the Long Commentary on the Physica are in preparation.

=== Collaborations ===
* Historical-Critical Edition of the Arabic-Latin Translations of Averroes's (Ibn Rushd's) Commentaries on Aristotle 
This project forms part of the edition of the Opera omnia, supervised by the International Union of Academies (Director: Gerhard Endress; responsible for the Averroes Latinus: Andreas Speer). It is funded by the Nordrhein-Westfälische Akademie der Wissenschaften.

** Middle Commentary on the Categoriae 
This Middle Commentary on the Categoriae forms part of the group of Middle Commentaries which Averroes devoted to the Organon and whose Latin translation is attributed to William of Luna. Prepared by a large number of publications, the work currently in progress continues the edition of the Middle Commentary on Peri Hermeneias which has already been published. At the moment the text is prepared for printing, the apparatus and the Latin-Arabic glossary are being adapted to the definite text. At the same time some parts of the introduction are developed further; for example, the question whether there were any double translations is examined, as is the Hebrew-Latin translation from the Renaissance. Did its author, Jacob Mantino, make use of the medieval Arabic-Latin translation or its editio princeps?

** Long Commentary on the Physica 
Averroes completed his Long Commentary on the Physics around the year 1186. Like a number of other works by Averroes, it was translated from Arabic to Latin at the beginning of the 13th century, most probably by Michael Scot. More than sixty medieval manuscripts, complete and fragmentary, preserve the versio vulgata of the text. The detailed documentation of its textual history evolves continually. With the exception of a few manuscripts the dependences and interrelations in the manuscript tradition have been established on the basis of a comparison of approximately 1100 positions. The results concerning the filiation of the manuscripts can thus be established.

** Long Commentary on the Physica, Book VII, according to Ms. Vienna, Austrian National Library, Lat. 2334 
In the manuscript of the Austrian National Library, Vienna lat. 2334, the seventh and part of the eight book of the Long Commentary are preserved in a translation which differs considerably from the one by Michel Scot, both in vocabulary and in syntax. This text will be edited separately. In order to prove that the translator was not Michel Scot, but probably Hermannus Alemannus, this edition will be accompanied by a detailed comparison of technical terms and of important portions of the text. The study has been approved by the Nordrhein-Westfälische Akademie and will be published by F. Schöningh, Paderborn ({{ISBN|978-3-506-76316-7}})

** Arabic Concepts of Metaphysics, Considering in particular Averroes's Epitome on Aristotle's Metaphysics 
The project comprises two parts: First, a historical-critical edition of the Arabic text of Averroes's Epitome on the Metaphysics which is based on all available Arabic manuscripts and which takes into account the Hebrew translation from the 13th century, as well as the Latin translation from the 16th based on the latter. The edition will be introduced by a philological study and accompanied by an English translation, in order to render the text available for a larger group of scholars in medieval philosophy. The second part consists in a historical and philosophical analysis of Arabic concepts of metaphysics, its foundations, objects, parts, and methods. Averroes's concept of metaphysics will be investigated in the historical and philosophical context of competing ideas. Of special interest is the question whether in the post-Avicennian tradition metaphysics was conceived as ontology and/or universal science in contradistinction from theology.

** Averroes-Database 
The bibliography of secondary literature on Averroes published since 1980 contains at present 1043 titles. It is constantly updated and accessible via internet. The bibliography of Averroes's works provides information on the relevant manuscripts, editions, and translations. It is still in preparation, but the sections on Logic, Philosophy of Nature, Psychology and the Doctrine of Intellect are already [online http://www.thomasinst.uni-koeln.de/averroes].

* Historical-Critical Edition of Aristotle's Meteorology in the Latin Translation by William of Moerbeke 
This project is part of the Aristoteles Latinus, edited by the International Union of Academies and directed by Carlos Steel. The Latin text of the Meteorology has already been published on the CD-ROM version of the Aristoteles Latinus (Édition CD-ROM des traductions gréco-latines d'Aristote) in 2003.

* Historical-Critical Edition of Book I and II of the Commentary on the Physics by Aegidius Romanus 
The Augustinian monk Aegidius Romanus (ca. 1243/7-1316) was a prominent figure at the University of Paris in the late 13th century. His philosophical works consist mainly in commentaries on Aristotle. In the late 13th and during the 14th century Aegidius's commentaries were well known; their impact can be compared with the paraphrases by Albert the Great and the commentaries by Thomas Aquinas. This project centres on the edition of book I and II of his commentary on the Physics (ca. 1274/75). They are devoted to some central issues in Aristotle's philosophy of nature, namely the problems of the principles of change, the concept of nature, and the concepts of necessity and chance. Aegidius's commentary is extant in thirty manuscripts. The manuscript tradition is complex because it is partly a University tradition, dependent on one exemplar from the university milieu, and partly independent. The text of books I and II has been established on the basis of eight manuscripts, and the sources have been traced. At present the historical and philological introduction is in preparation. The edition will be part of Aegidii Romani Opera omnia, edited by the Unione Accademica Nazionale, directed by Francesco Del Punta.

== History ==
The foundation of the Thomas-Institut on October 10, 1950, grew out of efforts to reinstall a centre for the study of medieval philosophy in Germany after World War II, one that would be able to inspire research into a philosophical tradition representing positive ideas and humanistic values. It was hoped that the discussion of the problems of our time would benefit from the results of such studies. Nevertheless, the Thomas-Institut was not conceived as part of the movement of [[Neo-Scholasticism]], but rather as an institution which would conduct research in medieval philosophy much in the same way that elsewhere research in ancient and modern philosophy was done - never as a narrowly historical enterprise, but always in touch with contemporary questions and perspectives.

Josef Koch (1885–1967), then one of the rare German scholars internationally renowned in the field of medieval philosophy, had been chosen in 1948 to become a professor at the University of Cologne with a view to the Institute's founding. In close connection with the founding of the Institute stood the creation of the Mediaevistentagung, and the series Studien und Texte zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters, both of which were devised by Koch and are still carried on today.

The development of the Institute was boosted by a grant from the American High Commissioner for Germany, arranged by Professor John O. Riedl of the Educational and Cultural Relation Division, and later of Marquette University in Milwaukee - a personal friend of founder Josef Koch. The Institute was able to move into three rooms in Universitätsstraße 22, where later it was allowed to expand considerably, and where it is still housed today. Since 1952 the Thomas-Institut has been maintained by the University of Cologne and has become an integral part of the Philosophy Department.

The first tasks of the newly created Institute consisted in building up a research library and in procuring the necessary microfilm copies of medieval manuscripts in order to render critical editions possible. The collection concentrated at first on [[Meister Eckhart]] and Nicolaus [[Cusanus]], who were then studied by Koch and editions of whose works were prepared at the Institute in continuation of projects begun before the war. The fund of manuscript copies grew steadily and was enriched by every new project. The library was designed to include not only primary texts from the Middle Ages and bibliographical material but a historical section spanning from Antiquity to contemporary philosophy that permits the systematic studies intended by the aims described in 1950.

In 1954 Koch was succeeded in the director's office by Paul Wilpert (1906–1967), an expert in [[Aristotle]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] and already affiliated with the [[Cusanus]] edition since the 1940s. It was Wilpert who created the Miscellanea Mediaevalia series in 1962, thus providing an organ for the publications of the Institute, first and foremost the proceedings of the Mediaevistentagungen. In 1961 Wilpert organized in Cologne the 2nd International Congress of Medieval Philosophy of the Société internationale pour l'Étude de la Philosophie Médiévale ([[S.I.E.P.M]]), whose vice chairman he had become in the founding year of the organization, 1958. With the activities of Wilpert's collaborator, Gudrun Vuillemin-Diem, the Thomas-Institut took part in the Aristoteles Latinus project of the International Union of Academies. Ms. Vuillemin-Diem has continued working with the Thomas-Institut under its subsequent directors, and has published to date the four medieval recensions of the Metaphysics.

After Wilpert's sudden death, Albert Zimmermann (1928–2017), a pupil of Josef Koch's, became the third director of the Thomas-Institut. His fields of research are especially the Aristotelian philosophy of nature in the Middle Ages and Latin Averroism. When the International Union of Academies took over the Averrois Opera project from the Medieval Academy of America, Zimmermann became its general editor in 1974 (until 1996) and the Thomas-Institut took the responsibility for the edition of the Latin translations of Averroes's commentaries. The project currently employs two editors, Roland Hissette and Horst Schmieja, and is funded by the Nordrhein-Westfälische Akademie der Wissenschaften. In 1992 Zimmermann was elected president of the [[S.I.E.P.M]].

Zimmermann retired in 1993 and was followed in office in 1994 by Jan Adrianus Aertsen, formerly a professor at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (since 1984).  His main area of research is the history of the Doctrine of Transcendentals.  In 1997 Aertsen was elected vice chairman of the [[S.I.E.P.M]]. The 4th Symposium Averroicum, combined with the sixth conference of the editors of Averroes's works, was held in Cologne in 1996 in collaboration with Gerhard Endreß (Bochum). In 1997 the Thomas-Institut under the lead of Jan A. Aertsen and Andreas Speer organized the 10th International Congress of Medieval Philosophy in Erfurt. Following a suggestion by Jan A. Aertsen and a conference in Cologne co-organized by the Thomas-Institut, a Gesellschaft für Philosophie des Mittelalters und der Renaissance ([http://www.gpmr.uni-koeln.de GPMR]) was set up in 2003, for which the Thomas-Institut currently provides the office.

The present director of the Thomas-Institut, [http://www.thomasinstitut.uni-koeln.de/mitarbeiter/speer/ Andreas Speer], formerly professor at Würzburg (2000), was appointed in 2004.

== Activities ==

=== Mediaevistentagung ===
Already on October 11, 1950, one day after the foundation of the Thomas-Institut, the first [http://www.kmt.uni-koeln.de Mediaevistentagung] took place. Josef Koch had invited scholars from Germany and from the Institut supérieur de philosophie of Louvain with the declared aim to assemble - not for a "congress" but in "friendly discussion" - all those interested in medieval studies: philosophers, theologians, historians, philologists, art- and music-historians. This interdisciplinary approach has since determined the programmes of the Mediaevistentagungen, which until 1960 were held every year. Since 1960 the Thomas-Institut organizes those conferences every two years in the second week of September.
Beginning with the second conference in 1951, which was devoted to medieval symbolism, every Mediaevistentagung has been centred on a global topic that stood in relation with the work done at the Institute or with current interests in the field of medieval studies. Since 1952, the results have been documented; the first proceedings were published in the series Studien und Texte zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters (vols. 3 and 5), since 1956 they are published in the Miscellanea Mediaevalia series created especially for that purpose.
While remaining true to its original concept, the Mediaevistentagung has become more fully international, bigger - the record was set with circa 300 participants in 1994 - and, not to mention, longer - it now lasts a week. In 2004 a workshop was introduced to precede the main conference. It provides a forum for younger scholars to present their works in progress or, alternatively, presents an opportunity to share different approaches and projects in open discussion.

=== Forschungskolloquium ===

The "Forschungskolloquium" is a series of loosely connected lectures by our collaborators, guests, or invitees. It affords an opportunity to present a particular field of research to the colleagues and at the same time to the wider public.

=== Köln-Bonner Philosophisches Kolloquium ===
The "Köln-Bonner Philosophisches Kolloquium", organized together with the Philosophy Department of [[Bonn University]], is a semester long reading course for graduate and older undergraduate students (taking place every two weeks). The course examines a systematic topic (e.g. Aristotelian psychology, concepts of metaphysics) throughout ancient and medieval philosophy.

The '''Institute of Plant Breeding (IPB)''' is a research institute of the [[University of the Philippines Los Baños]]. It is the national [[biotechnology]] research center and repository for all crops other than [[rice]], which is handled by the [[Philippine Rice Research Institute]].

It traces its roots to the [[Plant Breeding]] Division of the Department of [[Agronomy]], [[UPLB College of Agriculture|College of Agriculture]]. In 1975, President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] elevated the Division to an Institute and provided additional funds for new facilities and expanded research initiatives.

==Core functions==
*Develop new and improved varieties of dryland crops
*Conduct studies in plant breeding and allied disciplines related to crop improvement
*Collect, introduce, preserve, and maintain germplasm of important and potentially useful agricultural and horticultural crops
*Assist other agencies in multiplying quality seeds and vegetative materials of recommended crop varieties
*Promote widescale use of IPB varieties and ensure that seeds are made available to small farmers

==Divisions and laboratories==
*Cereal Crops Division
*Feed and Industrial Crops Division
*Fruit and Ornamental Crops Division
*Legume Crops Division
*Vegetables and Special Crops Division
*Plant Pathology Laboratory
*Entomology Laboratory
*Plant Physiology Laboratory
*Extension Division
*Genetics Laboratory
*National Plant Genetic Resources Laboratory
*Biochemistry Laboratory
*Plant Cell and Tissue Culture Laboratory
*National Seed Foundation

==Samples of IPB research==
*'''Papaya Ringspot Virus (PSRV)-Resistant'''
This variety is a genetically-enhanced [[papaya]] with PRSV resistance and delayed ripening trait. This trait will help reduce post-harvest losses due to spoilage which is another major problem to farmers. The first and second generation papayas had been previously subjected to polymerase chain reaction analysis, which indicated that the lines contain a copy of the PRSV coat protein gene. A third generation papaya is currently under development.

*'''Fruit and Shoot Borer Resistant Eggplant'''
Initial crosses had already been made between Indian transgenic [[eggplants]] and selected Philippine varieties Mara, Mistisa, Dumaguete Long Purple, and Casino. The progeny of these crosses were then back-crossed with their Philippine variety parent in [[India]].

*'''Multiple Virus Resistant Tomato'''
The multiple virus resistant project aims to combine transgenic technologies for Cucumber Mosaic Virus with conventional resistance against Tomato Leaf Curl Virus (ToLCV) to produce commercial tomato varieties. After introgression lines and appropriate controls were supplied by IPB partners, these tomato lines were screened to identify the genome regions that confer resistance against each local ToLCV. Reliable DNA markers are also being developed for each identified genome (introgression) region.

*'''Mutation Breeding of Philippine Avocado'''
Although engaged in [[genetic engineering]], the Institute also uses mutation breeding, which is an alternative method of improving crop varieties. Small portions of [[avocado]] plant tissue (embryos) were allowed to grow (embryogenic cultures) and to differentiate into somatic embryos and shoots. Some of the plant tissue cultures were subjected to gamma irradiation to facilitate mutation from the regenerated plant tissue cultures. During the irradiation, some cells were killed and those capable of regrowth were multiplied. The surviving cells were grown to produce somatic embryos and shoots. The shoots from irradiated and non-irradiated tissues were then treated in a [[test tube]] environment to promote root growth and prepare them for natural growth environment. The IPB is currently undertaking the rooting and potting out of the plantlets to enable maximum recovery. The established regenerated plants will then be transferred to the greenhouse, and finally to the field for further evaluation.
