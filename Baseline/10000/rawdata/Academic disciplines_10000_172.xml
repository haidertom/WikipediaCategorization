'''Agroecology''' is the study of [[applied ecology|ecological processes applied]] to [[agriculture|agricultural]] production systems. Bringing [[ecology#Fundamental principles of ecology|ecological principles]] to bear in [[agroecosystem]]s can suggest novel management approaches that would not otherwise be considered. The term is often used imprecisely and may refer to "a science, a movement, [or] a practice".&lt;ref&gt;Wezel, A., Bellon, S., Doré, T., Francis, C., Vallod, D., David, C. (2009). Agroecology as a science, a movement or a practice. A review. Agronomy for Sustainable Development (published online)&lt;/ref&gt; Agroecologists study a variety of agroecosystems. The field of agroecology is not associated with any one particular method of [[farming]], whether it be [[Organic farming|organic]], [[Integrated farming|integrated]], or [[Industrial agriculture|conventional]], [[Intensive farming|intensive]] or [[Extensive farming|extensive]]. However, it has much more in common with organic and integrated farming.&lt;ref&gt;Wibblemann et al. (2013) Mainstreaming Agroecology: Implications for Global Food and Farming Systems. {{cite web |url=http://futureoffood.org/pdfs/Coventry_University_2013_Maintstreaming_Agroecology.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522154628/http://futureoffood.org/pdfs/Coventry_University_2013_Maintstreaming_Agroecology.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological strategy==
Agroecologists do not unanimously oppose technology or inputs in agriculture but instead assess how, when, and if technology can be used in conjunction with natural, social and human assets.&lt;ref&gt;Pretty, Jules. 2008. Agricultural sustainability: concepts, principles and evidence. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 363, 447-465.&lt;/ref&gt; Agroecology proposes a context- or site-specific manner of studying agroecosystems, and as such, it recognizes that there is no universal formula or recipe for the success and maximum well-being of an agroecosystem.  Thus, agroecology is not defined by certain management practices, such as the use of [[Biological control|natural enemies]] in place of [[insecticides]], or [[polyculture]] in place of [[monoculture]].

Instead, agroecologists may study questions related to the four system properties of agroecosystems: [[Ecology#Ecosystem productivity|productivity]], [[Ecological stability|stability]], [[sustainability]] and [[equitability]].&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Gordon R. 1985. Agroecosystem analysis. Agricultural Administration, 20, 31-55.&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to disciplines that are concerned with only one or some of these properties, agroecologists see all four properties as interconnected and integral to the success of an agroecosystem. Recognizing that these properties are found on varying spatial scales, agroecologists do not limit themselves to the study of agroecosystems at any one scale: gene-organism-population-community-ecosystem-landscape-biome, field-farm-community-region-state-country-continent-global.

Agroecologists study these four properties through an interdisciplinary lens, using natural sciences to understand elements of agroecosystems such as soil properties and plant-insect interactions, as well as using social sciences to understand the effects of farming practices on rural communities, economic constraints to developing new production methods, or cultural factors determining farming practices.

==Approaches==
Agroecologists do not always agree about what agroecology is or should be in the long-term. Different definitions of the term agroecology can be distinguished largely by the specificity with which one defines the term "ecology", as well as the term's potential political connotations. Definitions of agroecology, therefore, may be first grouped according to the specific contexts within which they situate agriculture.
Agroecology is defined by the [[OECD]] as "the study of the relation of agricultural crops and environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=81 Agroecology], Glossary of Statistical Terms&lt;/ref&gt; This definition refers to the "-ecology" part of "agroecology" narrowly as the natural environment. Following this definition, an agroecologist would study agriculture's various relationships with [[soil health]], water quality, air quality, meso- and micro-fauna, surrounding flora, environmental toxins, and other environmental contexts.

A more common definition of the word can be taken from Dalgaard et al., who refer to agroecology as the study of the interactions between plants, animals, humans and the environment within agricultural systems.  Consequently, agroecology is inherently multidisciplinary, including factors from [[agronomy]], [[ecology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]] and related disciplines.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt; In this case, the "-ecology" portion of "agroecology is defined broadly to include social, cultural, and economic contexts as well. Francis et al. also expand the definition in the same way, but put more emphasis on the notion of food systems.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;

Agroecology is also defined differently according to geographic location. In the global south, the term often carries overtly political connotations. Such political definitions of the term usually ascribe to it the goals of social and economic justice; special attention, in this case, is often paid to the traditional farming knowledge of indigenous populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agroecology.org Agroecology.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422150352/http://www.agroecology.org/ |date=2006-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; North American and European uses of the term sometimes avoid the inclusion of such overtly political goals. In these cases, agroecology is seen more strictly as a scientific discipline with less specific social goals.

===Agro-population ecology===
This approach is derived from the science of ecology primarily based on [[population ecology]], which over the past three decades has been displacing the ecosystems biology of [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]].  Buttel explains the main difference between the two categories, saying that "the application of population ecology to agroecology involves the primacy not only of analyzing agroecosystems from the perspective of the [[population dynamics]] of their constituent species, and their relationships to [[climate]] and [[biogeochemistry]], but also there is a major emphasis placed on the role of [[genetics]]."&lt;ref name=buttel&gt;Buttel, Frederick. "Envisioning the Future Development of Farming in the USA: Agroecology between Extinction and Multifunctionality?" New Directions in Agroecology Research and Education (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous agroecology===

This concept was proposed by political ecologist Josep Garí to recognise and uphold the integrated agro-ecological practices of many indigenous peoples, who simultaneously and sustainably safeguard, manage and use ecosystems for agricultural, food, biodiversity and cultural purposes at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2001). Biodiversity and Indigenous Agroecology in Amazonia. Etnoecologica 5 (7): 21-37&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous agroecologies are not systems and practices halted in time, but keep co-evolving with new knowledge and resources, such as that provided by development projects, research initiatives and agro-biodiversity exchanges. In fact, the first agro-ecologists were indigenous peoples that advocated development policies and programmes to support their systems, rather than replacing them.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2000). The Political Ecology of Biodiversity. DPhil Dissertation, University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusive agroecology===
Rather than viewing agroecology as a subset of agriculture, Wojtkowski&lt;ref&gt;Wojtkowski, Paul A. (2002) Agroecological Perspectives in Agronomy, Forestry and Agroforestry. Science Publishers Inc., Enfield, NH, 356p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wojtkowski, Paul A. (2006) Introduction to Agroecology: Principles and Practices. Haworth Press, Binghamton, NY, 404p.&lt;/ref&gt; takes a more encompassing perspective. In this, natural ecology and agroecology are the major headings under ecology. Natural ecology is the study of organisms as they interact with and within natural environments. Correspondingly, agroecology is the basis for the land-use sciences. Here humans are the primary governing force for organisms within planned and managed, mostly terrestrial, environments.

As key headings, natural ecology and agroecology provide the theoretical base for their respective sciences. These theoretical bases overlap but differ in a major way. Economics has no role in the functioning of natural ecosystems whereas economics sets direction and purpose in agroecology.

Under agroecology are the three land-use sciences, [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], and [[agroforestry]]. Although these use their plant components in different ways, they share the same theoretical core.

Beyond this, the land-use sciences further subdivide. The subheadings include agronomy, [[organic farming]], traditional agriculture, [[permaculture]], and [[silviculture]]. Within this system of subdivisions, agroecology is philosophically neutral. The importance lies in providing a theoretical base hitherto lacking in the land-use sciences. This allows progress in biocomplex agroecosystems including the multi-species plantations of forestry and agroforestry.

==Applications==
To arrive at a point of view about a particular way of farming, an agroecologist would first seek to understand the contexts in which the farm(s) is(are) involved. Each farm may be inserted in a unique combination of factors or contexts. Each farmer may have their own premises about the meanings of an agricultural endeavor, and these meanings might be different from those of agroecologists. Generally, farmers seek a configuration that is viable in multiple contexts, such as family, financial, technical, political, logistical, market, environmental, spiritual. Agroecologists want to understand the behavior of those who seek livelihoods from plant and animal increase, acknowledging the organization and planning that is required to run a farm.

===Views on organic and non-organic milk production===

Because [[organic agriculture]] proclaims to sustain the health of soils, ecosystems, and people,&lt;ref&gt;IFOAM (International Federation for Organic Agriculture Movements)&lt;/ref&gt; it has much in common with Agroecology;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} this does not mean that Agroecology is synonymous with organic agriculture, nor that Agroecology views organic farming as the 'right' way of farming.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Also, it is important to point out that there are large differences in [[Organic food|organic standards]] among countries and certifying agencies.

Three of the main areas that agroecologists would look at in farms, would be: the environmental impacts, animal welfare issues, and the social aspects.

Environmental impacts caused by organic and non-organic milk production can vary significantly. For both cases, there are positive and negative environmental consequences.

Compared to conventional milk production, [[organic milk]] production tends to have lower [[eutrophication]] potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and phosphates (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of [[methane]].&lt;ref&gt;Boer, I J. M. 2003. Environmental impact assessment of conventional and organic milk production. Livestock Production Science. Vol 80, p 69–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Animal welfare]] issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

A key component of animal welfare is freedom to perform their innate (natural) behavior, and this is stated in one of the basic principles of organic agriculture. Also, there are other aspects of animal welfare to be considered – such as freedom from hunger, thirst, discomfort, injury, fear, distress, disease and pain. Because organic standards require loose housing systems, adequate bedding, restrictions on the area of slatted floors, a minimum [[forage]] proportion in the [[ruminant]] diets, and tend to limit stocking densities both on [[pasture]] and in housing for dairy cows, they potentially promote good foot and hoof health. Some studies show lower incidence of placenta retention, milk fever, abomasums displacement and other diseases in organic than in conventional dairy herds.&lt;ref&gt;Hovi, M. el al. 2003. Animal health and welfare in organic livestock production in Europe: current state and future challenges. Livestock Production Science. Vol 80, p 41–53.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the level of infections by parasites in organically managed herds is generally higher than in conventional herds.&lt;ref&gt;Bennedsgaard, T.W. et al. 2003. Eleven years of organic dairy production in Denmark: herd health and production related to time of conversion and compared to conventional production. Livestock production science. Vol 80, p 121-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social aspects of dairy enterprises include life quality of farmers, of farm labor, of rural and urban communities, and also includes public health.

Both organic and non-organic farms can have good and bad implications for the [[life quality]] of all the different people involved in that [[food chain]]. Issues like labor conditions, labor hours and labor rights, for instance, do not depend on the organic/non-organic characteristic of the farm; they can be more related to the socio-economical and cultural situations in which the farm is inserted, instead.

As for the public health or [[food safety]] concern, [[organic foods]] are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.

In an organic dairy farm, an agroecologist could evaluate the following:

# Can the farm minimize environmental impacts and increase its level of sustainability, for instance by efficiently increasing the [[productivity]] of the animals to minimize [[waste]] of feed and of land use?
# Are there ways to improve the [[animal health|health status]] of the herd (in the case of organics, by using [[biological pest control|biological controls]], for instance)?
# Does this way of farming sustain good [[quality of life]] for the [[farmer]]s, their families, [[farmworker|rural labor]] and communities involved?

===Views on no-till farming===

[[no-till farming|No-tillage]] is one of the components of [[conservation agriculture]] practices and is considered more environmental friendly than complete [[tillage]].&lt;ref name=Garcia-Torres&gt;Garcia-Torres, L. et al. 2002. Summary of the Workshop on Soil Protection and Sustainable Agriculture organized by the EU Commission DG Environment and the DG Environmental Quality of the Spanish Ministry of Environment (Soria, Spain)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Branco, H. and Lal, R. 2008. Principles of Conservation Management. No Tillage-Farming (Ch.8). Springer Verlag. Netherlands. P. 195&lt;/ref&gt; There is a general consensus that no-till can increase carbon content of topsoils, especially when combined with cover crops, but whether this improves the function of soils as a carbon sink is contested.&lt;ref name=Garcia-Torres/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolliger, A. et al. 2006. Taking stock of the Brazilian "Zero Till Revolution": A review of landmark research and farmers' practice. Adv. Agron. Vol 91, p 47–110&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Baker, J. M., Ochsner, T. E., Venterea, R. T., &amp; Griffis, T. J. (2007). Tillage and soil carbon sequestration—What do we really know?. Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment, 118(1-4), 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Powlson, D. S., Stirling, C. M., Jat, M. L., Gerard, B. G., Palm, C. A., Sanchez, P. A., &amp; Cassman, K. G. (2014). Limited potential of no-till agriculture for climate change mitigation. Nature Climate Change, 4(8), 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

No-till can contribute to higher [[soil organic matter]] and organic carbon content in soils,&lt;ref name=Calegari&gt;Calegari, A. et al. 2008. Impact of Long-Term No-Tillage and Cropping System Management on Soil Organic Carbon in an Oxisol: A Model for Sustainability. Agronomy Journal. Vol 100, Issue 4, p 1013-1019&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, T. and Post, W. 2002. Soil Organic Carbon Sequestration Rates by Tillage and Crop Rotation: A Global Data Analysis. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 66:1930–1946&lt;/ref&gt; though reports of no-effects of no-tillage in organic matter and organic carbon soil contents also exist, depending on environmental and crop conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Machado, P.L.O.A. and Silva, C.A. 2001. Soil management under no-tillage systems in the tropics with special reference to Brazil. Nutr. Cycling Agroecosyst. Vol 61, p 119–130&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, no-till can indirectly reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by decreasing the use of fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=Calegari /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koga, N. et al. 2003. Fuel consumption-derived CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions under conventional and reduced tillage cropping systems in northern Japan. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment. Vol 99, p 213–219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most crops can benefit from the practice of no-till, but not all crops are suitable for complete no-till agriculture.&lt;ref name="Fleizo et al. 2002"&gt;Fleizo et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koller&gt;Koller, K. 2003. Techniques of soil tillage. Ed. Adel El Titi ([[CRC Press]])&lt;/ref&gt; Crops that do not perform well when competing with other plants that grow in untilled soil in their early stages can be best grown by using other conservation tillage practices, like a combination of [[strip-till]] with no-till areas.&lt;ref name=Koller/&gt; Also, crops which harvestable portion grows underground can have better results with strip-tillage,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} mainly in soils which are hard for plant roots to penetrate into deeper layers to access water and nutrients.

The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations,&lt;ref&gt;Pavuk, D.M. 1994. Influence of weeds within Zea mays crop plantings on populations of adult Diabrotica barberi and Diabrotica virgifera virgifera. Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment. Vol 50, p 165-175&lt;/ref&gt; which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Brust, B. Stinner &amp; D. McCartney. 1986. Predator activity and predation in corn agroecosystems. Environmental Entomology 15:1017-1021&lt;/ref&gt;

In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, G.W., and P.R. Hill. 2000. Fall strip-tillage systems. p. 193–199. In R.C. Reeder (ed.) Conservation tillage systems and management. MWPS-45, 2nd ed. Iowa State Univ., Ames.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Licht, M.A. and Al-Kaisi, M. 2005. Strip-tillage effect on seedbed soil temperature and other soil physical properties. Soil and Tillage Research. Vol 80, p 233-249&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to [[pathogen]]s, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds,&lt;!-- I thought tillage caused more weed problems than no-till? This is one of the main reasons no-tillage is practiced --&gt; it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for [[pest control]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, [[mulch-till]] and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.

In a no-till system, an agroecologist could&lt;!-- Would they ask these questions? Where did this section originate?--&gt; ask the following:

# Can the farm minimize environmental impacts and increase its level of sustainability; for instance by efficiently increasing the productivity of the crops to minimize land use?
# Does this way of farming sustain good quality of life for the farmers, their families, rural labor and [[communities|rural communities]] involved?

==History==

===Pre-WWII===
The notions and ideas relating to crop ecology have been around since at least 1911 when [[Franklin Hiram King|F.H. King]] released ''Farmers of Forty Centuries''. King was one of the pioneers as a proponent of more quantitative methods for characterization of water relations and physical properties of soils.&lt;ref name=francis&gt;{{cite journal |last=Francis |date=2003 |title=Agroecology: the ecology of food systems |journal=Journal of Sustainable Agriculture |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=99–118 |doi=10.1300/J064v22n03_10|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s the attempt to merge agronomy and ecology was born with the development of the field of crop ecology. Crop ecology's main concern was where crops would be best grown.&lt;ref name=gliess&gt;Gliessman, Stephen. R  Agroecology: Ecological Processes in Sustainable Agriculture. Ann Arbor: Sleeping Bear Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, it was only in 1928 that agronomy and ecology were formally linked by Klages.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klages, K.H.W. 1928. Crop ecology and ecological crop geography in the agronomic curriculum. J. Amer. Soc. Agron. 20:336-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of the term agroecology was in 1928, with the publication of the term by Bensin in 1928.&lt;ref name=wezel/&gt; The book of Tischler (1965), was probably the first to be actually titled 'agroecology'.&lt;ref&gt;Tischler, W. (1965). Agrarökologie. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Jena, Germany, 499 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; He analysed the different components (plants, animals, soils and climate) and their interactions within an agroecosystem as well as the impact of human [[agricultural management]] on these components. Other books dealing with agroecology, but without using the term explicitly were published by the German zoologist Friederichs (1930) with his book on agricultural zoology and related ecological/environmental factors for plant protection,&lt;ref&gt;Friederichs, K. (1930) Die Grundfragen und Gesetzmäßigkeiten der land- und forstwirtschaftlichen Zoologie. Vol. 1: Ökologischer Teil, Vol. 2: Wirtschaftlicher Teil. Verlagsbuchhandlung Paul Parey, Berlin, Germany, 417 and 443 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and by American crop physiologist Hansen in 1939&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, B., Alrøe, H.F., Kristensen, E.S., 2001. Approaches to assess the [[environmental impact]] of [[organic agriculture|organic farming]] with particular regard to Denmark. Agric. Ecosys. Environ. 83, 11–26.&lt;/ref&gt; when both used the word as a synonym for the application of ecology within agriculture.&lt;ref name=dalgaard&gt;Dalgaard, Tommy, and Nicholas Hutchings, John Porter. "Agroecology, Scaling and Interdisciplinarity." Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment 100(2003): 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=This sentence seems self-contradictory. I.e., did they use the term or not?|date=July 2016}}

===Post-WWII===
Gliessman mentions that post-WWII, groups of scientists with ecologists gave more focus to experiments in the natural environment, while [[agronomist]]s dedicated their attention to the cultivated systems in agriculture.&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; According to Gliessman,&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; the two groups kept their research and interest apart until books and articles using the concept of agroecosystems and the word agroecology started to appear in 1970.&lt;ref name=wezel&gt;Wezel, A., Soldat, V. (2009). A quantitative and qualitative historical analysis of the scientific discipline agroecology. International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability 7 (1): 3-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dalgaard&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt; explains the different points of view in ecology schools, and the fundamental differences, which set the basis for the development of agroecology.  The early ecology school of [[Henry Gleason]] investigated plant populations focusing in the [[hierarchical]] levels of the organism under study.

Friederich Clement's ecology school, however included the organism in question as well as the higher hierarchical levels in its investigations, a "landscape perspective".  However, the ecological schools where the roots of agroecology lie are even broader in nature. The ecology school of [[Arthur Tansley|Tansley]],&lt;!--(1935)--&gt; whose view included both the biotic organism and their environment, is the one from which the concept of agroecosystems emerged in 1974 with Harper.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harper, J.L., 1974. Agric. Ecosyst. Agroecosyst. 1, 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s the increasing awareness of how humans manage the landscape and its consequences set the stage for the necessary cross between agronomy and ecology. Even though, in many ways the [[environmental movement]] in the US was a product of the times, the  {{clarify|text=Green Decade,|date=July 2016}} spread an environmental awareness of the [[unintended consequence]]s of changing ecological processes. Works such as ''[[Silent Spring]]'', and  ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'', and  changes in legislation such as the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], [[Clean Water Act]], and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] caused the public to be aware of societal growth patterns, agricultural production, and the overall capacity of the system.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt;

===Fusion with ecology===
After the 1970s, when agronomists saw the value of ecology and ecologists began to use the agricultural systems as study plots, studies in agroecology grew more rapidly.&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; Gliessman describes that the innovative work of Prof. Efraim Hernandez X., who developed research based on [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous systems of knowledge]] in [[Mexico]], led to education programs in agroecology.&lt;ref name=qFran&gt;qtd. in Francis ''et al.'' 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 Prof. Efraim Hernandez X. explained that modern agricultural systems had lost their ecological foundation when [[socio-economic]] factors became the only driving force in the [[food system]].&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; The acknowledgement that the socio-economic interactions are indeed one of the fundamental components of any agroecosystems came to light in 1982, with the article Agroecologia del Tropico Americano by Montaldo. The author argues that the socio-economic context cannot be separated from the agricultural systems when designing agricultural practices.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;

In 1995 Edens et al. in Sustainable Agriculture and Integrated Farming Systems solidified this idea proving his point by devoting special sections to economics of the systems, ecological impacts, and ethics and values in agriculture.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; Actually, 1985 ended up being a fertile and creative year for the new discipline. For instance in the same year, [[Miguel Altieri]] integrated how consolidation of the farms, and cropping systems impact pest populations. In addition, Gliessman highlighted that socio-economic, technological, and ecological components give rise to producer choices of food production systems.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; These pioneering agroecologists have helped to frame the foundation of what we today consider the interdisciplinary field of agroecology and have led to advances in a number of farming systems. In Asian rice, for example, crop diversification by growing flowering crops in strips beside rice fields has recently been demonstrated to reduce pests so effectively (by the flower nectar attracting and supporting parasitoids and predators) that insecticide spraying is reduced by 70%, yields increase by 5%, together resulting in an economic advantage of 7.5% [http://www.nature.com/articles/nplants201614 (Gurr et al., 2016)].

== By region ==

The principles of agroecology are expressed differently depending on local ecological and social contexts.

=== Latin America ===

{{Main article|Agroecology in Latin America}}
Latin America's experiences with North American Green Revolution agricultural techniques have opened space for agroecologists.  Traditional or [[indigenous knowledge]] represents a wealth of possibility for agroecologists, including "exchange of wisdoms".  See Miguel Alteiri's ''Enhancing the Productivity of Latin American Traditional Peasant Farming Systems Through an Agroecological Approach'' for information on agroecology in Latin America.

Agroecological techniques and knowledge played an important role in solving the severe food crisis in [[Cuba]] following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Funes |first1=Fernando |last2=García |first2=Luis |last3=Bourque |first3=Martin |last4=Pérez |first4=Nilda |last5=Rosset |first5=Peter |title=Sustainable Agriculture and Resistance: Transforming Food Production in Cuba |location= Oakland, CA |publisher=Food First Books |isbn=0-935028-87-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of Cuba's urban agricultural movement, agroecology is integral to production in Cuban [[organopónico|organopónicos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10460-015-9659-y |title=Low-carbon food supply: The ecological geography of Cuban urban agriculture and agroecological theory |journal=Agriculture and Human Values |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=771–784 |year=2016 |last1=Cederlöf |first1=Gustav }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===

Historically, agroecology has had low traction in Africa, as governments, international organisations, extension services and farmers' organisations tended to focus on issues of inputs and outputs as the defining factors to deal with recurrent food crises and chronic malnutrition in the continent. Agrocecology was only a minor proposal from a few, non-governmental, small-scale projects and a sort of "experimental" idea of the Farmer Field Schools programme.

In the early 2000s, when the AIDS pandemic was creating a major rural crisis across Africa, Josep Garí proposed FAO to consider an agroecological approach as the most effective way to empower farmers cope with the impacts of the AIDS pandemic on agriculture and food production: in particular, he proposed agro-biodiversity as a key resource and knowledge for farmers to address the labour and malnutrition crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2003). Agrobiodiversity strategies to combat food insecurity and HIV/AIDS impact in rural Africa. FAO / Population and Development Service, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was rapidly adopted by the Farmer Field Schools scheme across the world, and even presented and translated in China.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2004). Plant diversity, sustainable rural livelihoods and the HIV/AIDS crisis. Bangkok: UNDP &amp; FAO, 2004. Published in English and Chinese. {{ISBN|974-92021-4-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, agroecology has started to permeate projects and discourses on farming and natural-resource management in Africa. In 2011, the 1st encounter of agroecology trainers took place in Zimbabwe and issued the Shashe Declaration.

=== Madagascar ===
{{Main article|Agroecology in Madagascar}}
Most of the historical farming in Madagascar has been conducted by indigenous peoples.  The French [[Colonialism|colonial]] period disturbed a very small percentage of land area, and even included some useful experiments in [[Sustainable forestry]]. [[Slash-and-burn]] techniques, a component of some [[shifting cultivation]] systems have been practised by natives in Madagascar for centuries.  As of 2006 some of the major agricultural products from slash-and-burn methods are wood, charcoal and grass for [[Zebu]] grazing.  These practices have taken perhaps the greatest toll on land fertility since the end of French rule, mainly due to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures.

'''Abu al-Wafa' al-Mubashshir ibn Fatik''' ({{lang-ar|ابو الوافاء المبشّر بن فاتك}} {{transl|ar|Abū al-Wafā’ Al-Mubaššir ibn Fātik}}) was a scholar well versed in the mathematical sciences and also wrote  on logic and medicine. He was born in [[Damascus]] but lived mainly in Egypt during the 11th century [[Fatimid]] Caliphate. He also wrote an historical chronicle of the reign of al-Mustansir Billah. However, the book he is famed for and the only one extant, ''[[Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers|Kitāb mukhtār al-ḥikam wa-maḥāsin al-kalim]]'' ({{lang|ar|مختار الحكم ومحاسن الكلم}}), the "Selected Maxims and Aphorisms", is a collection of sayings attributed to the ancient sages (mainly Greeks) translated into Arabic.  The date of composition given by the author is 1048–1049.

==Biography==
The biographical details we have come from [[Ibn Abi Usaibia]]'s ''Uyūn ul-Anbāʾ fī Ṭabaqāt ul-Aṭibbāʾ'' ({{lang|ar|عيون الأنباء في طبقات الأطباء}}, "the History of Physicians"). According to Usaibia, Ibn Fatik was from a noble family and held the position of "[[emir]]" at the court of the [[Fatimids]] in the reign of al-Mustansir Billah. He was a passionate [[bibliophile]], acquired a great collection of books and enjoyed the company of scholars, and above all, he devoted himself to study. He trained in mathematics and astronomy under the philosopher, mathematician and astronomer [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (965-1040).  He also associated with Ibn al-Amidi and the physician, astrologer, and astronomer [[Ali ibn Ridwan]] (988–1061). When he died, many heads of state attended his funeral. According to this biography, such was his wife's disaffection through want of attention, she threw most of his books into the pool at the center of the house, and so they were lost by drowning.

==Works==
{{anchor|al-Mukhtar}} ''Kitāb mukhtār al-ḥikam wa-maḥāsin al-kalim'' ({{lang|ar|مختار الحكم ومحاسن الكلم}}), the “Book of Selected Maxims and Aphorisms”, can be described as a collection of biographies of twenty-one "sages", mainly Greeks (e.g. [[Seth]], ([[Zedekiah]]),&lt;ref&gt;The Spanish translation has "Sedechias" in place of Seth here. (See ''Bocados de Oro'')&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermes]], [[Homer]], [[Solon]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Diogenes]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Galen]], [[Alexander the Great]]), accompanied by the maxims and sayings attributed to them.  The biographies are largely legendary and most attributions highly dubious.

==Influences==
His ''al-Mukhtar'' was a great success in the centuries that followed, first in the Arab-Muslim world where it provided source material for later scholars, such as for Muhammad [[al-Shahrastani]] in his book ''Kitab al-wa-l-Milal Nihal'' and Shams [[al-Din al-Shahrazuri]] for his ''[[Nuzhat al-Arwah]]''.

==Translations==
; Spanish:
*''Los Bocados de Oro''; translated in the reign of [[Alfonso X of Castile]] (1252–1284) was the earliest translation into a Western European vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;This primitive text (existing in isolation in several manuscripts) was notably integrated in the story of the journey of "Bonium of King of Persia" went to India to find wisdom and which he write down in ''Las Los Palabras Sabios Philosophers''. Text printed in Seville in 1495, in Salamanca in 1499, in Toledo in 1502 and 1510, Valencia in 1522, and in Valladolid in 1527.&lt;/ref&gt; 
; Latin:
*''Liber Philosophorum Moralium Antiquorum'' by the Italian [[John of Procida]] († 1298), friend and doctor of [[Emperor Frederick II]].  Several early Latin translations appeared as  [[florilegia]] and excerpts integrated into larger works.
; French:
*''Les Dits Moraulx des Philosophes'' by {{ill|Guillaume de Tignonville|fr}}, chamberlain to [[Charles VI of France|King Charles VI]]; [[Middle French]] from the Latin translation. Of the fifty manuscripts extant the oldest dates from 1402. The first printed editions were made in [[Bruges]] by [[Colard Mansion]] (no date, perhaps 1477), in Paris by [[Antoine Vérard]] in 1486, by [[Jean Trepperel]] in 1502, by [[Galliot du Pré]] in 1531, etc. (Nine reported editions by 1533).
; Occitan:
*''Los Dichs dels Philosophes'' from the Tignonville's French translation.
; English:
*''[[The Dicts or Sayings of the Philosophers]]'' (1450) by [[Stephen Scrope]] for his stepfather, [[John Fastolf]]; [[Middle English]] translation.&lt;ref&gt;Ms. BL Harley 2266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Dicts and Sayings of the Philosophers''; transl. Stephen Scrope, William Worcester and an anonymous translator; ed. Curt F. Bühler (1941)&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers|The Dictes or Sayengis of the Philosophhres]]'' (1473) by [[Anthony Woodville]].&lt;ref&gt;Translation performed after a book containing the text Tignonville lent by a traveling companion, Louis Bretaylles.&lt;/ref&gt; William Worcester amended Woodville's translation and it appears this was the version printed by [[William Caxton]] in his Westminster workshop on November 18, 1477, the first book printed in England, that is discounting [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s [[Apostles' Creed]], (''Expositio in Symbolum Apostolorum'') printed December 17, 1468.

Dr '''Ashraf Choudhary''', {{post-nominals|country=NZL|QSO|size=85%}}, (born 15 February 1949) is a [[Pakistani New Zealander|Pakistani-New Zealand]] scientist in [[agricultural engineering]] and formerly a member of the [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] in New Zealand. He is a member of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], and was New Zealand's first MP from [[South Asia]] and [[Pakistan]].

==Education==
Choudhary was born in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Pakistani half]] of the [[Punjab region]] in village Jajay. He comes from a family of agriculture. He attended high school in the town of [[Sialkot]],&lt;ref name="pildat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pildat.org/eventsdel.asp?detid=65|title=Patience and Persistence required for a stable democracy in Pakistan|date=25 December 2004|publisher=PILDAT|accessdate=7 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615031605/http://www.pildat.org/eventsdel.asp?detid=65| archivedate= 15 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then gained a degree in [[agricultural engineering]] from [[University of Agriculture, Faisalabad]] (UAF) in [[Faisalabad]]. He continued his studies abroad, gaining a master's degree in [[agricultural engineering]] at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[England]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[agricultural engineering]] at [[Massey University]], New Zealand. By profession, Choudhary was originally an [[environmental scientist]] and taught at the Massey University of New Zealand before his induction into Parliament.&lt;ref name="pildat"/&gt; He has published a large number of scientific papers in his field, and is considered to be an international authority on [[conservation tillage]]. His work has a particular focus on agricultural techniques in developing countries. Choudhary has three children.

==Migrating to New Zealand==
Before entering [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], Choudhary had worked with a number of community organizations, including such groups as the New Zealand Federation of Ethnic Councils and [[FIANZ]] – the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (of which he was president in 1984–85). In his capacity as president of [[FIANZ]] he oversaw the first annual [[halal]] meat contract with the [[New Zealand Meat Producers Board]] in June 1984, with the aid of [[Mazhar Krasniqi]], Hajji Abdul Rahim Rasheed and Dr. Mohammad Hanif Quazi.

He was awarded a [[British and Commonwealth orders and decorations|QSO]] for his community work in 2001.

==Entrance into New Zealand politics==

 |party      = New Zealand Labour Party
 |list       = 31
}}
{{NZ parlbox footer}}
Having been a supporter of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] for some time, Choudhary was elected to Parliament as a Labour Party list MP in the [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 elections]]. He was sworn in on the [[Qur'an]], something which [[Winston Peters]] (leader of the [[New Zealand First]] party) criticised as a breach of proper procedure. The rules, however, contained no prohibition against it, allowing the taker of the oath to specify any religious text they wished (or, alternatively, use none at all). Because Parliamentary officials did not have a copy of the [[Qur'an]], they obtained a copy from the [[FIANZ]] office, which was then donated to the Parliamentary Library for use in the future.

Since entering [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], Choudhary has served on the Primary Production, Local Government and Environment, and Education and Science select committees. He also came to public attention in 2003, when he abstained in a vote to legalise [[prostitution]]. The Muslim community were upset by his decision to abstain from voting since prostitution is seen as a violation of their faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/206420/423466/article.html|title=Muslims upset with MP|date=17 July 2003|work=[[Television New Zealand]]|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution to the Muslim community in New Zealand==
Choudhary once again came to the attention of the Muslim community in December 2004, when he announced his intention to vote in favour of the deeply controversial [[Civil unions in New Zealand|Civil Union]] legislation. Choudhary remarked that "if the law allows one minority group in our society to be discriminated against then all minorities are vulnerable".

In July 2005 Choudhary came to the public's attention again when he refused to condemn outright the practice of [[stoning]] people for homosexual and extramarital sexual behaviour. In TV3's [[60 Minutes (New Zealand)|60 Minutes]] show on 4 July 2005, Dr. Choudhary was asked: "Are you saying the [[Qur'an]] is wrong to recommend that gays in certain circumstances be stoned to death?" He replied: " No, no. Certainly what the Qur'an says is correct." He then qualified his statement, "In those societies, not here in New Zealand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10334250|title=Some stoning okay says Choudhary|last=Berry|first=Ruth|date=5 July 2005|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
On 29 September 2011, Choudhary delivered his valedictory speech in Parliament and would retire from politics after the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://parliamenttoday.co.nz/2011/09/valedictory-speeches-sept-29/ Parliament Today – Valedictory Speeches Sept 29, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Since retiring Choudhary has been active in the Pakistani and Indian community circles of Auckland encouraging youth political involvement and supporting blood donor drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiannewslink.co.nz/index.php/archives2012/may_15_2012_issue/former-mp-calls-more-youngsters-to-politics.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213172129/http://www.indiannewslink.co.nz/index.php/archives2012/may_15_2012_issue/former-mp-calls-more-youngsters-to-politics.html |archivedate=13 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiannewslink.co.nz/index.php/archives2012/feb_1_2012_issue/pakistani-blood-donors-do-us-proud.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222203844/http://www.indiannewslink.co.nz/index.php/archives2012/feb_1_2012_issue/pakistani-blood-donors-do-us-proud.html |archivedate=22 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Auckland local elections, 2016|2016 Auckland elections]], Choudhary was elected to the Otara-Papatoetoe Local Board and Counties Manukau District Health Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/AboutCouncil/HowCouncilWorks/Elections/Documents/Confirmedlocalelectionresults2016.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019000339/http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/AboutCouncil/HowCouncilWorks/Elections/Documents/Confirmedlocalelectionresults2016.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/AboutCouncil/HowCouncilWorks/Elections/Documents/aucklanddhb2016.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019014606/http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/AboutCouncil/HowCouncilWorks/Elections/Documents/aucklanddhb2016.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In European [[architectural sculpture]], an '''atlas''' (also known as an '''atlant''', or '''atlante'''&lt;ref&gt; Hersey, George,  The Lost Meaning of Classical Architecture,  MIT Press, Cambridge, MA,  1998 p. 129 &lt;/ref&gt;  or '''atlantid'''; plural '''atlantes''')&lt;ref name="atlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Aru.html ''Aru-Az'''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704103828/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Aru.html |date=2008-07-04 }}, Michael Delahunt, [http://www.artlex.com/ ArtLex Art Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}, 1996–2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is a support sculpted in the form of a man, which may take the place of a [[column]], a [[Pier (architecture)|pier]] or a [[pilaster]]. The Roman term for such a sculptural support is a telamon (plural '''''telamones''''' or telamons).&lt;ref name="atlex" /&gt;

The term ''atlantes'' is the Greek plural of the name [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]—the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who was forced to hold the sky on his shoulders for eternity. The alternative term, ''telamones'', also is derived from a later mythological hero, [[Telamon]], one of the [[Argonauts]], who was the father of [[Telamonian Aias|Ajax]]. 

The [[caryatid]] is the female precursor of this architectural form in Greece, a woman standing in the place of each column or pillar. Caryatids are found at the treasuries at [[Delphi]] and the [[Erechtheion]] on the Acropolis at Athens for Athene. They usually are in an [[Ionic order|Ionic context]] and represented a ritual association with the goddesses worshiped within.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M., ed., ''Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture'', Dover Publications, New York,  1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Atalante is typically life-size or larger; smaller similar figures in the decorative arts are called [[Term (architecture)|terms]].  The body of many Atalantes turns into a rectangular pillar or other architectural feature around the waist level, a feature borrowed from the term.  The pose and expression of Alalantes very often show their effort to bear the heavy load of the building, which is rarely the case with terms and caryatids.  The [[herma]] or herm is a classical boundary marker or wayside monument to a god which is usually a square pillar with only a carved head on top, about life-size, and male genitals at the appropriate mid-point. Figures that are rightly called Atalantes may sometimes be described as herms.

Atlantes express extreme effort in their function, heads bent forward to support the weight of the structure above them across their shoulders, forearms often lifted to provide additional support, providing an architectural motif.  Atlantes and caryatids were noted by the Roman late Republican architect [[Vitruvius]], whose description of the structures,&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius, ''De Architectura'', 6.7.6.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than surviving examples, transmitted the idea of atlantes to the Renaissance architectural vocabulary.

==Origin==
Not only did the Caryatids precede them, but similar architectural figures already had been made in [[ancient Egypt]] out of [[monolith]]s. Atlantes originated in Greek Sicily and in [[Magna Graecia]], southern Italy. The [[:Image:Agrigento Telamon.jpg|earliest surviving atlantes]] are fallen ones from the Early Classical [[Greek temple]] of Zeus, the ''Olympeion'', in [[Agrigento]], Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdiva.blogspot.com/2008/05/vitruvius-caryatids-and-telamones.html Dorothy King, "Doric Figured Supports: Vitruvius’ Caryatids and Atlantes: 5.2 Atlantes and Telamones"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Atlantes, however, have played a more significant role in [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] and [[baroque architecture]]. 

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many buildings were built with glorious atlantes that look much like the Greek ones. Their selection from the two proposed designs&amp;mdash;the other design using Caryatids&amp;mdash;for the entrance of the [[Hermitage Museum]] that was built for Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] made atlantes become even more fashionable. The portico of this building has ten enormous atlantes, approximately three times life-size, carved from [[Sortavala|Serdobol granite]], which were designed by [[Johann Halbig]] and executed by the sculptor, [[Alexander Terebenev]].

==Mesoamerica==
Similar carved stone columns or pillars in the shape of fierce men at some sites of Pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerica]] are typically called [[Atlantean figures]].  These figures are considered to be "massive statues of [[Toltec]] warriors".&lt;ref name="Evans-p42"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Susan|title=Ancient Mexico and Central America: Archaeology and Culture History|year=2008|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christopher Small photo.jpg|x150px|thumb|alt=Christopher Small|Christopher Small]]
'''Christopher Neville Charles Small''' (17 March 1927 – 7 September 2011) was a New Zealand-born musician, educator, lecturer, and author of a number of influential books and articles in the fields of [[musicology]], [[sociomusicology]] and [[ethnomusicology]]. He coined the term '''musicking''', with which he wanted to highlight that music is a ''process'' (verb) and not an ''object'' (noun.)

==Biography==
Small was born in [[Palmerston North]], New Zealand, to a dentist and former schoolteacher, and was the youngest of three children.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite web | last = Laing | first = David | title = Christopher Small obituary | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date =19 September 2011 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/19/christopher-small-obituary | accessdate = 1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His early school education took place at the Terrace End and Russell Street Primary Schools (1932–39), [[Palmerston North Boys' High School]] (1940–41) and [[Wanganui Collegiate School]] (1942–44). Between 1945 and 1952 he attended the [[University of Otago]] and then [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University College]]. He taught at [[Horowhenua College]] (at the same time working at Morrow Productions Ltd making educational animated films) from 1953 to 1958, and at Waihi College from 1959 to 1960.

In 1960 he was awarded a New Zealand government bursary and he spent 1961 travelling in the United Kingdom, before studying [[Musical composition|composition]] in London with [[Priaulx Rainier]], where he also had contact with [[Bernard Rands]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]] and [[Witold Lutoslawski]]. After his studies he stayed in England, where he taught at schools, including Anstey College of Education in [[Birmingham]]. He became senior lecturer in music at [[Ealing College of Higher Education]] in London (1971–86) and he also taught at [[Dartington College of Arts]] in 1979. Between 1977 and 1986 he was adjunct professor of the history of music at Syracuse University London Centre, and a tutor in music to the summer school of the BEd course of Sussex University between 1981 and 1984.&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="philip"&gt;{{cite web | last = Norman | first = Philip | authorlink = Philip Norman (author) | title = Composer Profile: Christopher Small | url = http://sounz.org.nz/contributor/composer/1089 | accessdate = 2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired from teaching in 1986 and moved to [[Sitges]], Spain, where he lived with his partner Neville Braithwaite (a Jamaican-born dancer, singer, and youth worker) whom he married in 2006. During his time in Spain, Small conducted [[Catalonia|Catalan]] choirs and was visited regularly by people from both Europe and the USA, who admired his work. In the USA his ideas have been supported by prominent musicologists such as [[Charles Keil]], [[Robert Walser (musicologist)|Robert Walser]], [[Susan McClary]] and ''[[The Village Voice]]'' rock critic [[Robert Christgau]].&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;

Neville Braithwaite died in 2006, and Small died in 2011. He is survived by his sister, Rosemary.&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;

During his lifetime he published a number of books of his own, and was a contributor in numerous articles in journals such as ''[[Music in Education]]'', ''[[Tempo (journal)|Tempo]]'', ''[[The Musical Times]]'', ''[[Music and Letters]]'', and ''[[Musical America]]''. He lectured in many educational institutions in the United Kingdom, Norway, and the United States, contributed with papers to organisations such as the [[BASCA|Composers' Guild of Great Britain]] (1984), the Association of Improvising Musicians (1985), [[National Association for Music Education|Music Educators National Conference]] (Hartford, Connecticut, 1985; Washington DC, 1989) and the [[Society for Ethnomusicology]] (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1988).

Small took part in the series ''Sounds Different'', broadcast by BBC-TV2 (July 1982), and wrote ''This Is Who We Are'', a three-programme broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]] (March 1988) about [[Afro-American music]].&lt;ref name="philip" /&gt;

===Musicking===
In his book of the same title (''Musicking'', 1998), Small argues for introducing a new word to the English dictionary – that of ''musicking'' (from the verb ''to music''), meaning any activity involving or related to music performance. According to his own definition,

&lt;blockquote&gt;To music is to take part, in any capacity, in a musical performance, whether by performing, by listening, by rehearsing or practicing, by providing material for performance (what is called composing), or by dancing. We might at times even extend its meaning to what the person is doing who takes the tickets at the door or the hefty men who shift the piano and the drums or the roadies who set up the instruments and carry out the sound checks or the cleaners who clean up after everyone else has gone. They, too, are all contributing to the nature of the event that is a musical performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Musicking: The Meanings of Performing and Listening|last=Small|first=Christopher|date=1998|publisher=University Press of New England|year=|isbn=978-0-8195-2257-3|location=Hanover|pages=9|quote=|via=|authorlink=Christopher Small}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In expanding his ideas presented in his earlier book (''Music, Society, Education'', 1977), Small continues to demonstrate that musicking is an active way in which we relate to the rest of the world.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The act of musicking establishes in the place where it is happening a set of relationships, and it is in those relationships that the meaning of the act lies. They are to be found not only between those organized sounds which are conventionally thought of as being the stuff of musical meaning but also between the people who are taking part, in whatever capacity, in the performance; and they model, or stand as metaphor for, ideal relationships as the participants in the performance imagine them to be: relationships between person and person, between individual and society, between humanity and the natural world and even perhaps the supernatural world.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'' p.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the music context, the term '''chroma feature''' or '''chromagram''' closely relates to the twelve different [[pitch classes]]. Chroma-based features, which are also referred to [[Harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]], are a powerful tool for analyzing music whose pitches can be meaningfully categorized (often into twelve categories) and whose tuning approximates to the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered scale]]. One main property of chroma features is that they capture harmonic and melodic characteristics of music, while being robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation.

==Definition==

The underyling observation is that humans perceive two musical pitches as similar in color if they differ by an octave. Based on this observation, a pitch can be separated into two components, which are referred to as ''tone height'' and ''chroma''.&lt;ref name=Shepard64_pitch_ASA&gt;

|title=Circularity in judgments of relative pitch
|journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America
|volume=36
|issue=212
|date=1964
|pages=2346–2353}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered scale]], one considers twelve chroma values represented by the set

:{C, C{{music|#}}, D, D{{music|#}}, E ,F, F{{music|#}}, G, G{{music|#}}, A, A{{music|#}}, B}

that consists of the twelve pitch spelling attributes as used in Western music notation. Note that in the equal-tempered scale different pitch spellings such
C{{music|#}} and D{{music|b}} refer to the same chroma. Enumerating the chroma values, one can identify the set of chroma values with the set of integers {1,2,...,12}, where 1 refers to chroma C, 2 to C{{music|#}}, and so on. A [[pitch class]] is defined as the set of all pitches that share the same chroma. For example, using the [[scientific pitch notation]], the pitch class corresponding to the chroma C is the set

:{..., C&lt;sub&gt;−2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ...}

consisting of all pitches separated by an integer number of octaves. Given a music representation (e.g. a musical score or an audio recording), the  main idea of chroma features is to aggregate for a given local time window (e.g. specified in beats or in seconds) all information that relates to a given chroma into a single coefficient. Shifting the time window across the music representation results in a sequence of chroma features each expressing how the representation's pitch content within the time window is spread over the twelve chroma bands. The resulting time-chroma representation is also referred to as [[chromagram]]. The figure above shows chromagrams for a C-major scale, once obtained from a musical score and once from an audio recording. Because of the close relation between the terms chroma and pitch class, chroma features are also referred to as [[Harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]].

==Applications==
Identifying pitches that differ by an octave, chroma features show a high degree of robustness to variations in timbre and closely correlate to the musical aspect of harmony. This is the reason why chroma features are a well-established tool for processing and analyzing music data.&lt;ref name=Mueller15_FundamentalsMusicProcessig_SPRINGER&gt;

==Computation of audio chromagrams==
There are many ways for converting an audio recording into a chromagram. For example, the conversion of an audio recording into a chroma representation (or chromagram) may be performed either by using short-time Fourier transforms in combination with binning strategies&lt;ref name=BartschW05_chroma_IEEEMULTIMEDIA&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; or by employing suitable multirate filter banks.&lt;ref name=MuellerKC05_ChromaFeatures_ISMIR/&gt;
Furthermore, the properties of chroma features can be significantly changed by
introducing suitable pre- and post-processing steps modifying spectral, temporal,
and dynamical aspects. This leads to a large number of chroma variants, which
may show a quite different behavior in the context of a specific music analysis scenario.&lt;ref name=MuellerE11_ChromaToolbox_ISMIR&gt;

A '''''condaghe''''' (&lt;small&gt;also spelled as&lt;/small&gt; ''condache'' &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; ''condake'', {{IPA-srd|konˈdaɣe}}; &lt;small&gt;also&lt;/small&gt; ''fundaghe''), from the medieval [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] term ''kondake'' (from {{lang-grc-x-byzant|κοντάκιον|[[kontákion]]|the pole around which a scroll is wound}}), was a kind of administrative document used in the [[Sardinia]]n [[Giudicati|judicates]] between the 11th and 13th centuries. They are one of the earliest witnesses for the development of the Sardinian language and are an important source for historians of medieval Sardinia.

The original ''condaghes'' ({{lang-it|condaghi}}) were collections of acts of donations to churches or monasteries. Later ''condaghes'' were kept by noble families for recording inheritances, purchases, donations (''datura''), transactions (''tramutu'') and litigation (''kertu''), principally when relating to the church. The chief object of such records was to provide precise dates in case of legal dispute.

Physically, the first ''condaghes'' were scrolls: overlapping parchment manuscripts wound tightly around a ''kontákion''. Over time they took on the familiar form of a [[codex]] (like modern books). They were produced in the [[scriptoria]] of monasteries and cathedrals, but the great majority have been lost. Only some ''condaghes'' have been preserved, with most of them being of ecclesiastical kind like the ''condaghes'' of the monasteries of [[Santa Maria di Bonarcado]] (''Sancte Marie de Monarcanto'' or ''Bonorcadu''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filologiasarda.eu/pubblicazioni/pdf/cfsvirdis/bonarcado_edizione.pdf Condaghe of Saint Mary of Bonarcado]&lt;/ref&gt;), [[San Michele di Salvennor]] (''San Miguel de Salvennor'', the document of which we have only a translation into Spanish from an original Sardinian copy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filologiasarda.eu/pubblicazioni/pdf/cfssalvennor/salvennor_condaghe.pdf Condaghe of Saint Miguel de Salvennor]&lt;/ref&gt;), [[San Nicola di Trullas]] (''Sanctu Nichola de Trullas''), [[San Pietro in Silki]] (''Sanctu Petru de Silki''), and of the [[Basilica of San Gavino]] (''Sanctu Gavinu''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filologiasarda.eu/files/documenti/pubblicazioni_pdf/cfssangavino/02condaghe.pdf Condaghe of Saint Gavin]&lt;/ref&gt;). There is only a single condaghe of laical kind left, the one of Judge [[Barisone II of Logudoro]].

The '''Dhaneswar Khera Buddha image inscription''' is an epigraphic record on the base of a bronze image of the [[Buddha]] recording its dedication by the wife of Harirāja of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] lineage. The inscription provides an important documentation on the local Gupta dynasty and has been dated to the early 5th Century AD.

==Discovery==
''Dhaneswar Khera'' (sometimes also referred to as Danesar Khera) is located near the village of Icchāwar or Nicchāwar in Jaspura Tahsil, [[Banda District]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. The bronze statue was discovered in the nineteenth century with two others and published by William Hooey and [[Vincent Arthur Smith]] in 1895. Since 1969 it has been kept in the [[British Museum]] where it is displayed in the Asian Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/b/bronze_figure_of_the_seated_bu.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The other two statues from the hoard are in the [[Bangkok National Museum]] and the [[Nelson Atkins Museum of Art]] in Kansas City.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila E. Hoey Middleton, "The Third Buddha," ''South Asian Studies'' 18.1 (2002): pp. 67-72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nelson-atkins.org/art/CollectionDatabase_ImageView.cfm?id=27864&amp;theme=SseAsia Nelson Atkins Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Inscription==
The inscription is written in [[Sanskrit]] on the pedestal of the sculpture. It was first noted in 1949 and subsequently published by [[Dineschandra Sircar|D. C. Sircar]] in ''[[Epigraphia Indica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''JOR'' 28 (1949): p. 185ff; D. C. Sircar, "Copper Coin of Harigupta", ''Epigraphia Indica'' 33 (1959-60): p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The record was later discussed by P. L. Gupta.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Gupta, ''Imperial Guptas'', p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translation ==
A literal translation of the text is below:

1) deya-dharmmo=ya[ṃ*] Gupta=vaṅśo [read: vaṃś]-odita-śrī-Harirājasya ra [read: rā]jñī-mahādevyā[ḥ] [|*] yad=attra puṇya[ṃ*] tad=bhavatu

2) sa[rvva]-sa[TV(ttvā)nā][ṃ*] māta(tā)-pitṛ-pū[rvva]ṅgama(me)na anuttara-pada-jñāna (n-ā)vāptaye [||*]

The inscription records that the statue of the Buddha was the meritorious gift (''deyadharma'') of Mahādevī, the queen of Harirāja. The ruler Hariāja is described as being ‘born in the Gupta lineage’ who is also recorded on a copper-plate charter from [[Vārānasī]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=223694&amp;partId=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Environmental communication''' refers to the study and practice of how individuals, institutions, societies, and cultures craft, distribute, receive, understand, and use messages about the [[Natural environment|environment]] and human interactions with the environment. This includes a wide range of possible interactions, from interpersonal communication to [[virtual communities]], participatory decision making, and environmental media coverage. And it also includes verbal communication.

From the perspective of practice, Alexander Flor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/181519/Environmental_Communication|title=Environmental Communication|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines environmental communication as the application of communication approaches, principles, strategies and techniques to environmental management and protection.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander. (2004). ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander_Flor/publication/276930253_Environmental_Communication_Principles_Approaches_and_Strategies_of_Communication_Applied_to_Environmental_Management/links/555c380908ae6aea081734c5/Environmental-Communication-Principles-Approaches-and-Strategies-of-Communication-Applied-to-Environmental-Management.pdf Environmental Communication]''. Diliman, Quezon City: University of the Philippines-Open University.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic field ==
As an academic field, environmental communication emerged from interdisciplinary work involving [[communication studies|communication]], [[environmental studies]], [[environmental science]], [[risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] and management, [[sociology]], and [[political ecology]].

Flor (2004) considers it as a significant element in the environmental sciences, which he believes to be a [[transdisciplinary|transdicipline]]. He begins his textbook on environmental communication with a declarative statement, "Environmentalism as we know it today began with environmental communication. The environmental movement was ignited by a spark from a writer’s pen, or more specifically and accurately, [[Rachel Carson]]’s typewriter." According to Flor, environmental communication has six essentials: knowledge of ecological laws; sensitivity to the cultural dimension; ability to network effectively; efficiency in using media for social agenda setting; appreciation and practice of environmental ethics; and conflict resolution, mediation and arbitration (Ibid). In an earlier book, Flor and Gomez (1993) explore the development of an environmental communication curriculum from the perspectives of practitioners from the government, the private sector and the academe.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander, and Gomez, Ely D., eds. (1993). ''Environmental Communication: Considerations in Curriculum and Delivery Systems Development''. Los Banos, Laguna: University of the Philippines Los Banos - Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change communications has historically focused on [[news]] coverage and [[dissemination|disseminating]] information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbet|first1=M. C.|title=Communicating climate change:  Why frames matter for public engagement|journal=Environment|date=2009|volume=51|issue=2|pages=14–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic fields such as [[psychology]], [[environmental sociology]], and [[risk communication]] have argued that public nonresponse to climate change is due to a lack of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norgaard|first1=K. M.|title=Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life|date=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262015448}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life,'' Norgaard's (2011) study of Bygdaby (a fictional name used for a real city in Norway) found that non-response was much more complex than just a lack of information. In fact, too much information can do the exact opposite because people tend to neglect [[global warming]] once they realize there is no easy solution. When people understand the complexity of the issue, they can feel overwhelmed and helpless which can lead to [[apathy]] or [[skepticism]]. [[Environmental skepticism]] is an increasing challenge for environmental rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacques|first1=P.|title=Environmental Skepticism: Ecology, Power and Public Life|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0754671022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolic action ==
Environmental communication is also a type of symbolic action that serves two functions. Those functions are [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] and [[wikt:constitutive|constitutive]]. Environmental human communication is pragmatic because it helps individuals and organizations to accomplish goals and literally do things through communication. Examples of this include educating, alerting, persuading and collaborating. Environmental human communication is constitutive because it helps to shape people's understandings of environmental issues, themselves, and Nature; it shapes the meanings we hold of these things. Examples of this include values, attitudes, and ideologies vis-à-vis Nature and environmental issues and problems.Environmental nature communication happens when plants actually communicate,within ecosystems:"A plant injured on one leaf by a nibbling insect can alert its other leaves to begin anticipatory defense responses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1112]&lt;/ref&gt; "When a leaf gets eaten, it warns other leaves by using some of the same signals as animals. Plant biologists are "starting to unravel a long-standing mystery about how different parts of a plant communicate with one another."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Communication Theory has one universal law, written by S. F. Scudder in the early 1900s, and later published in 1980. The Universal Communication Law states that, "All living entities, beings and creatures communicate."{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In an unpublished interview, Scudder clarified the concept - "All of the living communicate through movements, sounds, reactions, physical changes, gestures, languages, breath, color transformations, etc. Communication is a means of survival, existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge the communication exists. Examples - the cry of a child (communication that it is hungry, hurt, cold, etc.); the browning of a leaf,a leaf that becomes defensive as it's being consumed,"A plant injured on one leaf by a nibbling insect can alert its other leaves to begin anticipatory defense responses. Working in the model plant Arabidopsis, Toyota et al. show that this systemic signal begins with the release of glutamate, which is perceived by glutamate receptor–like ion channels (see the Perspective by Muday and Brown-Harding). The ion channels then set off a cascade of changes in calcium ion concentration that propagate through the phloem vasculature and through intercellular channels called plasmodesmata. This glutamate-based long-distance signaling is rapid: Within minutes, an undamaged leaf can respond to the fate of a distant leaf." &lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1112&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt; A leaf that communicates that it is being eaten); the cry of an animal (communicating that it is injured, hungry, angry, etc.)are examples that sit inside the universal law that Everything living communicates."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt;]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Scudder's thesis is aptly reinforced by General Systems Theory, which submits that one of the three critical functions of living systems is the exchange of information with its environment and with other living systems (the other two being the exchange of materials and the exchange of energy). In his book, Flor (2004, page 4) extends this argument by forwarding that, "All living systems, from the simplest to the most complex, are equipped to perform these critical functions. They are called ''critical'' because they are necessary for the survival of the living system. Communication is nothing more than the exchange of information. Hence, at its broadest sense, environmental communication is necessary for the survival of every living system, be it an organism, an ecosystem, or (even) a social system."

== Areas of study and practice ==
According to J. Robert Cox, the field of environmental communication is composed of seven major areas of study and practice:

# Environmental [[rhetoric]] and [[discourse]]
# [[News media|Media]] and [[environmental journalism]]
# [[Public participation]] in environmental decision making
# [[Social marketing]] and [[advocacy|advocacy campaigns]]
# Environmental [[collaboration]] and [[conflict resolution]]
# [[Risk communication]]
# Representations of Nature in [[popular culture]] and [[green marketing]]&lt;ref&gt;Cox, J. Robert. (2010). ''Environmental Communication And The Public Sphere''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, pp.??{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female participation and advancement in majority [[Muslim countries]], or nations in which more than 50% of the population identifies as an adherent of the Islamic faith, has traditionally been areas of controversy. Several Western nations&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, William; Joseph Hickey (2005). Society in Focus.

Low levels of female labor participation, large wage gaps by gender, and few female executives in large companies in majority Muslim nations are common criticisms of these nations.&lt;ref name = "Rizzo" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Moghadam" /&gt; Accordingly, significant data has been gathered by global institutions about female workers in majority Muslim nations to test these cultural beliefs.

[[File:World Muslim Population (Pew Forum).svg|450px|thumb|A map of the Muslim population of the world, by percentage of each country, according to the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Forum]] 2009 report on world Muslim populations.]]
There are fifty-one countries in the world in which more than 50% of the population identify as Muslims.&lt;ref name = "Muslim World"&gt;"Muslim Population by Country". The Future of the Global Muslim Population. Pew Research Center. Retrieved 22 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These countries spread from [[North Africa]], to the [[Middle East]], to the [[Balkans]] and [[Central Asia]], to [[Southeast Asia]]. While many nations contain a strong Muslim presence, majority Muslim nations, by definition, have more Muslims as citizens than non-Muslims. Not all majority Muslim states, however, have Islam as their established religion. Turkey, for example, is a prominent Muslim country in which 99% of the population follows some form of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no official religion. The state is secular. Nigeria is also a majority Muslim country which is officially secular.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html CIA Factbook -Nigeria].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most majority Muslim nations, however, recognize Islam as the official state religion. Furthermore, many states identify a specific derivative of the Islamic faith as their official religion. For example, [[sunni]] Islam is the official state religion of: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Jordan, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Somalia, and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html CIA Factbook].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shia]] Islam is the official religion of Iran, which is a theocracy. Some minority Islamic sects are official state religions as well.[[Ibadi]], a minority school within Islam, is the official religion of Oman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html CIA Factbook -Oman].&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all states in the [[Muslim World]] institutionalize a distinction between the sects of Islam.

Retrieved 2012-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt; All sects or schools are included. In Egypt, freedom of religion is extended to the [[Abrahamic religions]] even though Sunni Islam is the state-sponsored religion. Similarly, Indonesia, which is the world's largest Muslim country, guarantees freedom of religion but only recognizes six official religions. Islam is one of and the most prominent of the six. Despite a common religion, majority Muslim nations are quite disparate in terms of size, population, demographic composition, and the legal framework of religion.

A basic indicator of women's involvement in the formal economy is a statistic known as the [[labor force participation rate]]. This data point shows the percentage of women in a country who are either employed in full or part-time labor. According to the [[International Labour Organization]], the labor force participation rate is defined as "the proportion of the population ages 15 and older that is economically active: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period."&lt;ref name = "ILO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/support/lib/resource/subject/labourstat.htm|title=Research guides|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Table 2 lists the labor force participation rates of women in eleven majority [[Muslim]] countries. Majority Muslim countries are defined as states in which more than 50% of the population identifies with the Islamic faith.

Of these eleven countries, [[Bangladesh]] and [[Indonesia]] had the highest rates of female participation in the labor force in 2010 with 57% and 51%, respectively. [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], and [[Afghanistan]] have the lowest rates of female labor force participation among these eleven nations with 13%, 14%, and 15%, respectively. However, numerically large discrepancies exist in the data for a couple of nations when drawn from different sources. Afghanistan's female labor force participation rate, for example, was 15% in 2010 according to World Bank figures.&lt;ref name = "World Bank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/topic/gender|title=Gender|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That percentage nearly doubles to 28.9% if data from [[UNESCAP]] is cited.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/stat/data/syb2011/III-Economy/Employment.asp|title=Employment, Statistical Yearbook for Asia and the Pacific 2011|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same discrepancy is true for figures for Iran for which the World Bank lists its female participation rate at 16% in 2010 and UNESCAP lists it as 26.9%.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt; It is unclear why these two sources give significantly different numbers as their methodology and definitions of labor force participation were similar.

[[File:Female Employment to Female Population in 11 Muslim Majority Countries.png|thumb|450px|A graph of the percentage of women in 11 Muslim majority populations who are in the labor force relative to the entire population of women in those countries.]]

=== Female-to-male workers ratio ===

Another statistic indicative of female participation in the formal economy of a country is the ratio of female to male workers. As nations develop and their economies both expand and diversify, the expansion of jobs and industries increases this ratio, pushing it toward 1, provided female workers have access to job opportunities and firms, collectively, do not systematically discriminate against female candidates.&lt;ref name="Perkins, Dwight H. 2006"/&gt;

Generally speaking, the closer the ratio is to 1, the more gender equal an economy is because neither sex has a disproportionate share of jobs. Bangladesh and Indonesia have the largest ratio of these eleven countries with scores of 0.73 and 0.61, respectively. [[Nigeria]] also has a relatively large ratio of female to male workers of 0.51. Despite having twice the percentage of females in the actual labor force, [[Turkey]]'s female to male laborer ratio is far lower than Iran's, 0.35 to 0.44. Similarly, Syria's ratio is barely smaller than [[Egypt]]'s (0.27 as compared to 0.30) whereas Egypt's female population has twice the percentage size of formal economic workers as Syria's female labor force. These ratios are compiled and published by the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum"&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2012.pdf The Global Gender Gap Report 2012], World Economic Forum. By Ricardo Hausmann, Laura D. Tyson and Saadia Zahidi&lt;/ref&gt; The median annual income for female workers in the United States was $36,931 in 2010.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/womens-earnings-and-income|title=Knowledge Center|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forum did not, however, list this information for Afghanistan, Iraq, or [[Tunisia]]. It is probable that the ratios are small given the low labor force participation rate of women in these countries and high unemployment rates, but given the uncertain correlation between female labor force participation rate and the ratio of male to female workers, this cannot be stated with any certainty. One possible explanation for the seeming discrepancy is the ratio of females to males in the population. In Syria, for every woman between the ages of 15 and 65, there are 1.03 males.&lt;ref&gt;"Syria." CIA World Fact Book. Central Intelligence Agency, n.d. Web. 21 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there are more men than women for a limited number of jobs, more men, in absolute terms, are excluded from [[informal sector|formal employment]]. Consequently, the ratio of female to male workers increases because women represent a larger percentage of those who work than they represent the entire labor force. Therefore, women would have a relatively higher ratio of female to male workers than its female labor force participation rate may suggest. The sheer size of the male component of the workforce may be sufficient to create a small ratio of female to male workers.

Similar to the ratio of female to male workers in the labor force is the percentage of the actual labor force composed of women. This differs from the labor force participation rate of women because it shows female workers as a percentage of the total number of workers in the economy as opposed to the percentage of the population of women that are involved in the formal economy. A large female labor force participation rate does not necessarily correlate to a substantial percentage of females in the labor force. However, a high female labor force participation rate demonstrates high economic participation by women in a country regardless of the size of the labor market itself that these women compose. Demographics, particularly birth rates, and human capital formation through education, good nutrition, and access to infrastructure and institutions may play a role in the discrepancies between these indicators.&lt;ref name="Perkins, Dwight H. 2006"/&gt;

However, as one is a subsect of the other, the two figures generally move collinearly. Despite a lower female labor force participation rate and a smaller female to male worker ratio, Nigeria's female workers represent the largest component, in terms of percentage, of a nation's labor force when compared to the other ten countries.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/|title=Country Facts Explorer - IndexMundi|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Labour Organization]], 42.84% of the Nigerian labor force is composed of women. Bangladesh and Indonesia are a close second and third with 39.87% and 38.23%, respectively. Iraq, Syria, and Turkey's labor force's female composition rates (14.30%, 15.20%, and 28.69%, respectively) are quite close to their female labor force participation rates which suggests a population parity between men and women. This is interesting as many other Developing countries do not have population parity by gender.&lt;ref&gt;"Sex Ratio". The World Factbook.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female employment characteristics==
There are a variety of characteristics of female employment such as salary and employment type which are meaningful indicators of female economic participation and female economic stability. These indicators help clarify the economic status women hold in some majority Muslim nations and the permanence of their involvement in the economy. In development economics, great emphasis has been placed on salaried work because it provides a stable source of income.&lt;ref name="Perkins, Dwight H. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chen"&gt;Chen, Martha, Joann Vanek, Francie Lund, James Heintz, Renana Jhabvala, and Christine Bonner. Women, Work, and Poverty. Rep. New York: United Nations Development Fund for Women, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salaried work===

''Salaried worker'', as defined by the [[International Labour Organization]], are "workers who hold the type of jobs defined as 'paid employment job' where the incumbents hold explicit (written or oral), or implicit employment contracts that give them a basic remuneration that is not directly dependent upon the revenue of the unit for which they work."&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Fundamentally, salaried workers are more likely to be full-time or, even permanent workers.&lt;ref name = "Chen" /&gt; Thus, they are staples of the formal market whereas non-salaried workers are more or less on the fringe of economic activity which relegates them to limited participation in the formal market.&lt;ref name = "Chen" /&gt;

While labor force participation rate sheds light on how many women work in the formal sectors of the economy, it says nothing about the type of work or the stable presence of women in the labor force. Countries such as Bangladesh and Indonesia, when female labor force participation rate or the ratio of male to female workers or similar indicators are considered, appear to have substantial female involvement in their economies. However, very few of the women in these nations have salaried work which means they may go through cycles of short periods of work punctuated by long periods of unemployment. Alternatively, these women may be shuffled from task to task for different employers and never develop a stable basis at a particular firm or within a particular field.

In Bangladesh and Indonesia, two majority Muslim countries with high female labor force participation rates, 11.70% and 31.70% of female workers are salaried, respectively.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Perhaps counter intuitively, majority Muslim countries such as Egypt, Iran, Syria, and Tunisia which have low rates of female labor force participation and a relatively small number of actual female laborers have high rates of female salaried employees. In Egypt, 47.9% of employed females have salaried jobs.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

In Iran, 46.8% of female workers are salaried and in Tunisia the percentage is 69.1%. Perhaps the most surprising case is Syria where 74.30% of women are salaried.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; This is the largest percentage in the Middle East and one of the highest in the entire Muslim world.

It is unclear why several nations with few female workers have such a high percentage of salaried women. One possible explanation is that so few women are active in the labor market because the demand for female employment is restricted to a few higher-paying, low-labor-intensive industries. If only a few women are needed but they need to have above-average skills, then these laborers' marginal value may necessitate salary as opposed to simple wages. This information has not been provided by the ILO for Iraq, Saudi Arabia, or Afghanistan.

===Employers, employees, self-employed===
'''Employees and self-employed'''

Women's role in the economy as employees, employers, or as self-employed labor units is another important characteristic of female labor force participation. In patriarchal societies or rigid(high degree of difficulty for workers to move between industries)  labor markets, women are more likely to be employees than employers because they do not have the resources, skills, networks, or opportunities to either be promoted within a firm or to be owners of small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).&lt;ref&gt;Bernasek, Alexandra. "Banking on Social Change: Grameen Bank Lending to Women."International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society. 16.3 (2003): 369-385. Web. 2 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, Abhijit V. and Esther Duflo. 2011. “Barefoot Hedge-Fund Managers” and “The Men from Kabul and the Eunuchs of India: The (Not So) Simple Economics of Lending to the Poor,” in Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty. New York: PublicAffairs. Chapters 6 and 7, pp. 133–82 and notes, pp. 287–89&lt;/ref&gt; In poor countries, or countries with large swaths of poverty within the population, which many predominantly Muslim nations are or have,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-related-factors-economic.aspx|title=Related Factors|date=27 January 2011|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the probability of self-employment is greater because women cannot find more established jobs.

There are, however, dozens of reasons why women may be employees, employers, or self-employed that reach beyond basic macroeconomic forces or social norms and conventions. According to the ILO, more than half, 53% of all female workers in Iran are self-employed. In Egypt, slightly fewer women are self-employed than are in Iran. Fifty-two percent of Egyptian female workers have their own business ventures. Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Indonesia have the highest rates of female self-employment with 86.7%, 77.9%, and 68.3%, respectively.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Very few women are involved in the formal labor market in Pakistan but more than three fourths of them are self-employed. Nearly half of working women in Turkey are self-employers with 49% of female workers operating their own private enterprise or services.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Female economic activity and participation is widely distributed across the Muslim world.

==== Female employers ====

The female labor force participation rate, the ratio of female workers to male workers, the wage security of women, and other elements of formal economic activity cover a large interval across predominantly Muslim nations. However, across most majority Muslim nations, there is a sharp convergence on female employers. With the exception of Turkey, hardly any women are employers in many majority Muslim nations.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

In Turkey, 48% of female workers are employers. This statistic suggests that Turkish women hire at least one additional worker for their self-employed commercial enterprises considering that self-employment is the most common form of employment among this demographic group. The second largest percentage of female employers as a percentage of female workers is 3% in Egypt. In Indonesia where 68% of women are self-employed and 38% of the labor force is composed of women, only 1% of these individuals are employers.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

One tenth of one percent of female workers in Bangladesh are employers despite the nation's sizable female labor pool. This number is one eighth of the percentage of Syrian women who are employers. Syria has, of course, only one eighth the population of Bangladesh. In majority Muslim countries, very few women and a small percentage of women who do work are employers.

==== Limited economic opportunities ====

Such high rates of self-employment and low rates of females as employers suggest that the economies of Muslim nations provide few formal opportunities for females to work in the private sector. Furthermore, it suggests that even fewer women have the ability to advance within their organization when they do earn work with an established business. High rates of self-employment can be indicative of a gender biased economic system but it can also simply indicate a poorly developed system.

The wide gap between male and female labor force participation rates and ratios, and the gap between male and female employers is indicative of gender inequality within the private sector of majority Muslim countries. However, numerous reasons may account for these outcomes such as weak education infrastructure for women, low levels of economic development, or simply capital-intensive resource development. The latter characteristic is probably given how many majority Muslim nations are net oil exporters.&lt;ref&gt; Note, however, that a direct test of this hypothesis by Korotayev et al. has yielded negative results ([https://www.academia.edu/9919252/Female_Labor_Force_Participation_Rate_Islam_and_Arab_Culture_in_Cross-Cultural_Perspective Korotayev, A. V., Issaev, L. M., &amp; Shishkina, A. R. (2015). Female Labor Force Participation Rate, Islam, and Arab Culture in Cross-Cultural Perspective. Cross-Cultural Research, 49(1), 3-19].). &lt;/ref&gt;

===Female unemployment===

Unemployment rates among women in majority Muslim countries are high.&lt;ref&gt;Global Employment Trend 2011. Rep. Geneva: International Labour Organization, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; When aggregated by region, North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, the three regions with the most and highest density of Muslims in the world, have the highest rates of female unemployment in the world.&lt;ref name = "Seager"&gt;Seager, Joni. "The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World: Completely Revised and Updated (Reference) [Paperback]." The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World: Completely Revised and Updated (Reference): Joni Seager: 9780142002414: Amazon.com: Books. N.p., n.d. Web. 01 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In North Africa, 17% of females are unemployed and 16% of women in the Middle East are unemployed.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt;

In both these regions, male unemployment was only 10%. Only Sub-Saharan Africa had a male unemployment rate as high as 10%.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt; Seven percent of women are unemployed in Southeast Asia as compared to 6% of men. South Asia, which contains a few majority Muslim nations such as Bangladesh, has a higher female unemployment rate, 6%, than a male unemployment rate which is 5%. However, non-Muslim regions of the world also demonstrate disproportional employment figures. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the female unemployment rate was 11% in 2006 while the male unemployment rate was only 7%.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt;

In the European Union and other Developed countries such as the United States, female unemployment is higher than male unemployment. In 2006, Seven percent of women in the Developed World were unemployed as compared to 6% of men. Both rates have increased dramatically since the Great Recession but more women are still unemployed than men in these countries.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; Data demonstrates that a greater proportion of women are unemployed relative to men in majority Muslim countries but that trend is true of several non-Muslim majority regions as well.

[[File:Shows the female unemployment rate in eleven majority Muslim countries from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s.png|450px|thumb]]

Structural unemployment in Muslim countries seems to be high for women and economic opportunities are limited. Possible explanations for this phenomenon could the same determinants of high self-employment among females and low rates of female employers: low levels of economic development, gendered employment social norms, or capital-intensive industry. This last explanation may be particularly salient in the oil-rich Muslim nations because petroleum exports are capital-intensive and require very high skilled labor which most Muslim women are incapable of providing given low levels of education. The Great Recession has increased unemployment across the board in many Muslim nations and female workers were not left unaffected. According to the World Bank, in 2009, 22.9% of women were unemployed in Egypt.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt;

In Syria in 2010, 22.5% of women were unemployed.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; This figure has probably increased significantly due to the [[Syrian civil war]].&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh all had female unemployment levels below 10% which is similar to female unemployment rates in many Developed countries such as the United States. Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Iran all have female unemployment rates ranging from 15% to 17%.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; Female unemployment in Iran may be exacerbated by the collateral effects US, UN, and European sanctions. To what extent this is true is uncertain.

Turkey has a moderate level of female unemployment relative to other Muslim countries. In 2008, 11.6% of women were unemployed.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; By 2010, this number crept up to 13.0%. However, long-term employment is a significant portion of female unemployment. In 2010, according to World Bank statistics, 37% of all unemployed women were long-run unemployed workers, or workers who have been out of work for more than one year.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; Very little data exists on the long-term unemployment rates of women for most nations and for Middle Eastern nations in particular.

==Occupations, opportunities, and wages==

===Female employment by economic sector===
In many economies, women are traditionally funneled into specific occupations or employment fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jacobsen | first1 = Joyce P. | last2 = Baker | first2 = Matthew J. | author-link1 = Joyce P. Jacobsen | title = Marriage, specialization, and the gender division of labor | journal = [[Journal of Labor Economics]] | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 763–793 | publisher = [[Chicago University Press|Chicago Journals]] via [[JSTOR]] | doi = 10.1086/522907 | jstor = 10.1086/522907 | date = October 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/522907 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [ftp://dlib.info/opt/ReDIF/RePEc/usn/wp/usnawp1.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar trend is also present in the economies of many majority Muslim nation's economies as well. The International Labour Organization, the World Bank, and the UN divide a national economy into three broad categories: agriculture, industry, and services. Agriculture is any work which relates to the primary development of resources for nutritious consumption. According to the UN, whose definitions the ILO, World Bank, and other data collection bases use, agricultural work includes forestry, hunting, and fishing in addition to land cultivation.&lt;ref name = "UN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?cl=2|title=United Nations Statistics Division - Classifications Registry: International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Rev.3 | website = unstats.un.org/unsd |publisher= [[United Nations Statistics Division]] |accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial employment is involvement in the manufacturing of products from raw materials or work for the purpose of extracting raw materials. This includes mining, quarrying, oil and gas production, construction, and public utilities.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

Services-oriented labor revolves around the provision of consumable, non-durable goods and the fulfillment of tasks by an external source for the consumer. This includes wholesale and retail trade and restaurants and hotels; transport, storage, and communications; financing, insurance, real estate, and business services; and community, social, and personal services.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; Most female laborers in Muslim majority countries work in the agriculture sector but many also work in private service jobs. Few, though some, women are employed in industrial-oriented labor.

In four of the eleven nations for which there is data, the percentage of female workers who are in the agricultural sector as compared to the percentage of female workers in the services sector. In Turkey, for example, 42% of female workers are employed in the agricultural sector and 42% work in some form of services enterprise.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Forty-nine percent of female employees work in agriculture in Egypt as compared to 46% of women who work in the services industry. Saudi Arabia is the only nation in which women play a negligible role agriculture.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Tunisian, Nigerian, and Iranian women are more evenly distributed across the economic sectors. Iranian female workers are particularly evenly distributed across all three divisions with 3 of 10 women in agriculture, 4 of 10 in services, and just over one quarter in industry. Saudi Arabian women, on the other hand, are entirely concentrated in the services industry.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

==== Agriculture ====

Employment in agriculture is lower-paying and lower-skilled than so called "white collared" jobs. Agriculture is also incredibly labor-intensive. The combination of these characteristics may explain why so many women in majority Muslim countries work in agriculture. Female workers generally have fewer skills than male workers in Developing nations. Literacy rates and school enrollment rate of females are generally low and low relative to men in developing countries of which many majority countries are.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

Accordingly, they are not hired for high skill work but they provide an abundant labor source for physical work such as agriculture. However, many majority Muslim nations, including Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, all of which have varying levels of female participation within their economies, have more than 80% of their female citizens enrolled in secondary education.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Nearly all of them are literate as well.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

This data somewhat undermines the traditional economic explanation of the concentration of female labor in agriculture. Regardless of the underlying reason for high female participation in agriculture, these workers earn a lower wage than their male counterparts both within this sector and relative to workers in other sectors. This may be one reason for the wide wage gap in some majority Muslim countries.

Female workers in majority Muslim nations are more concentrated in agricultural work than their counterparts in non-majority Muslim nations as well. For nations where data is available, Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Iran, Indonesia, and Egypt had the highest percentage of female workers involved in agricultural labor than almost every other country.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt; In these nations, anywhere from 20-49% of farm workers were female from 1995 to 2005. Over this time period, 50%-69% of farm workers in Turkey, Syria, and Pakistan were women. Only Cambodia, Laos, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, and Madagascar had higher percentages of female agricultural workers.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt;

==== Services and industry ====

The services sector also employs a significant percentage of females and, possibly, for similar reasons. Service jobs such as culinary arts, retail, and administrative work, similar to agriculture, is low-skill, low-paying labor-intensive work. Many bodies are needed to complete generally basic routine tasks. Accordingly, they are more suited to women in developing countries as higher-paying jobs may require a specificity of skills beyond those of the general female laborer and in countries with gender biases.

While the percentage of women working low-skill agriculture and services work is compatible with the notion that women face limited economic opportunities in Muslim nations, data from the ILO does not support or refute that conclusion. Industrial work attracts few women which may be accounted for the physical nature of much industrial work. Furthermore, if women in majority Muslim countries are funneled into agriculture and service-oriented work due to a weak skill set, then it follows that they would not be hired for industrial work as some of it, such as smelting, requires specific vocational skills.

===Executive positions===
{{see also|Glass ceiling}}

The [[glass ceiling]] is one prevalent concern about the quality of economic opportunity available to women involved in the formal labor market. This phenomenon is the de facto limitation of females' ability to achieve the top levels of leadership in an organization. While the concept is not restricted to the market, it is prevalent in profit-based institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint, Johanne. "The Glass Ceiling." Feminism and Women's Studies (1993). Web. 22 Mar 2011.&lt; http://feminism.eserver.org/the-glass-ceiling.txt&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, David A., Joan M. Hermsen, Seth Ovadia, and Reece Vanneman (2001). The glass ceiling effect. Social Forces, Vol. 80 No. 2, pp. 655–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies-Netzley, Sally A. (1998). Women above the Glass Ceiling: Perceptions on Corporate Mobility and Strategies for Success Gender and Society, Vol. 12, No. 3, p. 340, doi:10.1177/0891243298012003006.&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to female workers in majority Muslim countries, women are not evenly represented on the board of directors or among the senior management positions of most of the 100 most lucrative companies in the Arab World.&lt;ref name = "Muslim Companies"&gt;http://www.middleeastdirectory.com/top-companies-arab-world.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, for example, there is only one female senior executive among its five largest commercial enterprises. Orascom Telecom Holding Company, which is the 62nd largest company in the Muslim World&lt;ref name = "Muslim Companies" /&gt; (nations whose populations are predominantly Islamic), has one female member of its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orascomtelecom.com/about/board.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This woman, Elena Shmatova, however, is neither Egyptian nor Muslim which does not suggest opportunity for female advancement. Egypt's other largest firms by revenue, Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation, Suez Canal Authority, Orascom Construction Industries, and Telekom Egypt, do not have a single female member of their board of directors or among their senior management teams.

No women occupy the top leadership positions in the most profitable Iranian businesses either.&lt;ref name="payvand.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/feb/1110.html|title=Where Are Iran's Working Women?|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's three largest companies-National Iranian Oil Company (the second largest in the Muslim World), Iran Khodro, and National Petrochemical Company-also do not have any women in senior leadership positions. This is not surprising as the 2006 Iranian census showed that only 4% of women are in senior executive or management positions.&lt;ref name="payvand.com"/&gt; Critics of Iran's radical shia theocratic government may attribute this evidence of limited female economic mobility as a critique of the government's ideology. However, in Turkey, which is a secular state governed by a moderate Islamic party, women comprised only 8% of managers in the labor force in 2007.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt; Regardless of the official status of Islam or the ideology of the ruling party, there exists some evidence of a glass ceiling for women in the private sector.

Eleven of the Muslim world's largest businesses are located in Indonesia. These firms include automotive giant Astra International, Bank Rakyat Indonesia, and electric service provider Perusahaan Listrik Negara. Of these eleven firms, seven of them have at least one female member of the board of directors or a female in a senior executive management position. However, only Gudang Garam, a massive cigarette manufacturer, and Pertamina, the largest company in Indonesia, have 2 female members on the board of commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gudanggaramtbk.com/ina/directors/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pertamina.com|title=Pertamina|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pertamina is owned and operated by Japanese, not Indonesian, executives, however, and none of its female leaders are Muslim or Indonesian.

==Claims of gender inequality in the Muslim world==
Majority Muslim countries have been criticized for implementing policies which perpetuate gender inequality. Limits on the economic rights of women under the rule of law are present in several Muslim nations.&lt;ref name = "Rizzo" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Moghadam" /&gt; In Saudi Arabia, for example, women are allowed to work but their formal employment cannot interfere with her duties as a homemaker.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;International Management: Explorations Across Cultures - Page 74, Elizabeth M Christopher - 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi female workers must also travel with male companions, and they cannot work unless their husbands or guardians approve.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Claims that Islam promotes gender inequality ===

Sociologists Helen Rizzo, Abdel-Hamid Abdel-Latif, and Katherine Meyer explored cultural attitudes in majority Muslim countries subdivided by Arab and non-Arab.&lt;ref name = "Rizzo"&gt;Rizzo, Helen, Katherine Meyere, and Abdel-Hamid Abdel-Latif. "The Relationship Between Gender Equality and Democracy: A Comparison of Arab vs. Non-Arab Muslim Societies." Sociology 41 (2007): 1151-170. SAGE. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab states studied were Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Morocco, and Jordan while the non-Arab nations were Turkey, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Indonesia. To be Arab nations, states had to be members of the Arab League and recognize Arabic as the official language. Of these states, Rizzo et al. found that the Arab states were significantly less pro-gender equality and opportunity for women than the non-Arab states despite their shared Islamic faith.&lt;ref name = "Rizzo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These results were further supported by Korotayev et al. ([https://www.academia.edu/9919252/Female_Labor_Force_Participation_Rate_Islam_and_Arab_Culture_in_Cross-Cultural_Perspective Korotayev, A. V., Issaev, L. M., &amp; Shishkina, A. R. (2015). Female Labor Force Participation Rate, Islam, and Arab Culture in Cross-Cultural Perspective. Cross-Cultural Research, 49(1), 3-19].). &lt;/ref&gt;

However, neither group of countries was pro-gender equality in the sense that policies aimed at equal rights between the sexes are popular. In Arab countries, 82% of survey respondents believe that a man has more right to a job than a woman while 63% of respondents from the non-Arab countries felt the same way.&lt;ref name = "Rizzo" /&gt; These researchers attributed these attitudes to the strong religious identity and adherence of respondents thus implicating Islam in promoting gender inequality in majority Muslim nations.

=== Denials that Islam promotes gender inequality ===

Academic literature is mixed on this subject, however. Some scholars do not believe that gender inequality in majority Muslim states is a product of Islam. Feminist sociologist [[Valentine Moghadam]] has written extensively on gender inequality, including employment inequality, in the Muslim World.&lt;ref name = "Moghadam"&gt;Moghadam, Valentine M. "The Reproduction of Gender Inequality in Muslim Societies: A Case Study of Iran in the 1980s." World Development 19.10 (1991): 1335-349. Science Direct. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Moghadam, women are victims of clear political, economic, and social disparities in many Islamic countries which create gender distinctions within the public and private spheres. This inhibits the ability of women to participate in the government or to advance in the private sector. Moghadam specifically points to low female labor force participation across the board in Muslim states as a sign of gender inequality as do other scholars (Youseff 1978, Sivard 1985).&lt;ref name = "Moghadam" /&gt;

However, she does not believe that Islam is the root cause of gender inequality in the Muslim World because it is implemented differently in different countries, the status of women in the Muslim World is varied, and numerous other factors (state ideology, economic development, urbanization, etc.) affect gender equality. She points at that certain views which are considered by critics of Islam to be indicative of a gender-biased theology are present in other religions. Viewing women as mothers and daughters first and foremost, for example, is also a common belief among Orthodox Jews according to Moghadam.&lt;ref name = "Moghadam" /&gt;

Many cultures divide occupations along gender lines such as teaching and education administration or nursing and doctors. Why are Muslim nations singled out for holding similar gender biases as non-Muslim nations, asks Moghadam. She does state, however, that the presence of fundamentalist Islamic voices in influential positions in states such as Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan has helped perpetuate institutionalized gender disparities. Iran, in particular, provides little economic opportunity for women which has resulted in limited participation in the formal economy. In 1986, for example, 11 million women were not counted in the labor force because the Iranian regime deemed them to be "homemakers."&lt;ref name = "Moghadam" /&gt; Many women, particularly agricultural workers, do not receive wages frequently, which marginalizes them as economic actors.

=== Claims that Radical Islam promotes gender inequality ===

[[Ziba Mir-Hosseini]] takes a middle path on the question of Islam and gender equality as do many other theorists. Hosseieni is a visiting school at New York University Law school. Hosseini argues that the faith of Islamic and general principles promote gender equality.&lt;ref name = "Hosseini"&gt;Mir-Hosseini, Ziba. "Muslim Women’s Quest for Equality: Between Islamic Law and Feminism." Critical Inquiry 32 (2006): n. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hosseini, theocratic Islamic regimes which conflate theocracy with democracy, such as Iran or Afghanistan under the Taliban, create a tension which reinforces fundamentalist, reactionary thinking. This in turn leads to the repression of women.&lt;ref name = "Hosseini" /&gt; She argues that it is not that majority Muslim nations are intrinsically predisposed to gender inequality, it is that ultra conservative regimes are. This is also occurring in Iraq under Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]]. Hosseini points to "Islamic feminism" as proof of Islam's inherent compatibility with gender equality and a sign that Muslim states will progress toward gender equality while remaining Islamic in character.&lt;ref name = "Hosseini" /&gt; A patriarchal interpretation of Islam must be defeated, not Islam itself, argues Hosseini.

==Gender equality and the formal labor market==
{{see also| Gender inequality}}

=== Estimated earned income ===

Gender equality in the workplace is a major concern of many social activists, public officials, and academics, among others. Even in Developed Countries and wealthy democracies such as the United States there is concern of gender inequities in economic mobility for women. [[President of usa|American President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act]] was passed in response to concerns among Americans that women were receiving lower wages for equal work. Wages and wage equality with men are two common indicators of gender equality and opportunity within a formal market. Higher aggregate wages indicate that females are holding more productive, valued jobs which is considered indicative of social progress. Equal pay with men demonstrates a neutrality to gender within the workplace and may suggest functional fairness between female workers  and their male counterparts. Given these two indicators, wage statistics suggest that gender equality in terms of economic participation and the quality of formal economic opportunities are not high in many predominantly Muslim nations. In 2011, the World Economic Forum gathered information about the estimated earned income of women in 135 countries. Of these countries, Syria placed 134th in terms of earned annual income for women.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

Egypt finished 126th, Iran was 130th, Pakistan was 131st, and Saudi Arabia was 132nd.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  Even countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Turkey, which have substantially larger and higher-status female participation in their economies, placed 90th, 112th, and 121st, respectively, in terms of earned annual income for female laborers.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  Several poorer and more volatile states in Sub-Saharan Africa outperformed these nations. The estimated annual income of these women were, in terms of U.S. dollars' [[purchasing power parity]], quite low and only a fraction of their male counterparts' wages.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

[[File:Estimated Earned Annual Income of Women in 11 Majority Muslim Nations and the Female-to-Male Ratio of Workers.png|thumb|550px|The Estimated Earned Income of Women in 11 Muslim Majority Countries.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;]]

Turkey and Saudi Arabia award women the highest annual incomes when adjusted for purchasing power parity in terms of U.S. dollars. Female workers in Turkey are estimated by the World Economic Forum to earn $7,813 while Saudi female workers earn $6,652.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  Women in Pakistan don't even earn $1,000 for a year's worth of labor ($940) Egyptian, Syrian, Indonesian, Nigerian, and Bangladeshi women earn less, far less for some countries (Syria, Bangladesh, Nigeria), than $3,000 annually.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  The median annual income for female workers in the United States was $36,931 in 2010.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt;

Women in these countries earn very low wages when compared to men from the same country. Out of 11 of the most populated and economically significant Muslim majority nations (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Tunisia, Nigeria, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) only two nations, Bangladesh and Nigeria have a gender wage gap below 50%. In Nigeria, women earn 57 cents to the dollar of a man, according to the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Report 2012. Women in Bangladesh earn 52% of their males counterparts' wage. In Syria, women only earn 15% of a man's wage.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

These large disparities in income size and relative size to men in addition to low overall labor involvement, few salaried positions, and high levels of unemployment suggest that these nations' economies perpetuate significant gender disparities. However, low wages and large wage gaps can be explained by the different types of work men and women perform in these countries. If women are hired for mostly low-skill, low-wage work which is less productive and less elastic in demand than the work of most men, then their wages should be low and be significantly smaller than men's wages. Furthermore, a large supply of female labor for the few jobs women do work in these various economies may be depressing wages.

=== Wage gap ===

Low wages in absolute terms and low wages relative to men's wages in the aggregate, however, do not provide a full picture of gender economic equity. The ratio of income for women to men for equal work is another significant financial indicator of economic gender equality. Using this metric, these countries, collectively, are moderately equal relative to the majority of the world. The World Economic Forum's 2012 Gender Report found that women in Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia all received approximately 60% of the wages of a male for the same work.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

Respectively, these nations were ranked 87th, 85th, 58th, and 94th in the world out of 135. While not terribly equal, these nations were not too far behind the median nation. Egypt, however, is the most gender equal country in terms of equal pay. The World Economic Forum found that Egyptian women receive 82% of the income of their true male counterparts, not of men in general.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt; No other nation's women earn as high an income percentage as that.

===World Economic Forum economic participation and Opportunity subindex===
{{see also|Global Gender Gap Report}}
''''Global Gender Gap Index'''

An additional measurement of gender inequality is the World Economic Forum global gender gap index which it measures for 135 countries each year and publishes its results in its ''Gender Gap Report.'' Its statistic is known as the ''Global Gender Gap Index.'' The index measures gender disparities in economic, political, health, and educational spheres and uses corresponding criteria.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

The GGGI utilizes four sub-indices to measure these four spheres of inequality and to create a composite metric of gender inequality. The four sub-indices are: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. The economic participation and opportunity subindex "is captured through three concepts: the participation gap, the remuneration gap and the advancement gap. The participation gap is captured  using the difference in labour force participation rates. The remuneration gap is captured through a hard data indicator (ratio of estimated female-to-male earned income) and a qualitative variable calculated through the World Economic Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey (wage equality for similar work). Finally, the gap between the advancement of women and men is captured through two hard data statistics (the ratio of women to men among legislators, senior officials and managers, and the ratio of women to men among technical and professional workers)."&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

The index is measured on a scale of 0 to 1 with 1 indicating a perfectly equal level of participation in the labor market between men and women and equal economic opportunities and o indicating complete inequality. Of the 135 nations analyzed, Pakistan (134), Syria (132), and Saudi Arabia (131) are in the bottom five countries for female labor force participation and for the provision of labor opportunities for women.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

The GGGI is a comprehensive index relative to other measures of gender inequality such as the [[Gender Inequality Index]] produced by the United Nations. One serious critique of the index, however, is that the measurement of a country's gender equality is too dependent on income.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  While the ratio of income between men and women is taken into account, over reliance on financial data may benefit more Developed countries by virtue of having larger economies which can accommodate higher wages. The multiple subsections of the index, however, aim to condition the final measurement of economic participation and opportunity with emphasis on the ratio of wages, job advancement, and other metrics of females to males. This methodology quantifies gender inequality by analyzing the gap between males and females instead of absolute measurements.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

===UN Gender Inequality Index===
{{see also|Gender Inequality Index}}

The most frequently cited indicator of gender inequality is the [[United Nation]]'s [[Gender Inequality Index]], or GII. It was adopted in 2010 because the Gender Development Index did not measure gender inequality directly. It measured female development.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; The Gender Empowerment Measurement was replaced as well due to its overemphasis of income. As a consequence of this methodological construction, the GEM over estimated gender inequality in poor countries. Consequently, the GII was adopted to address these flaws and to be a true measure of inequality and not a proxy indicator. Income is not a component of the GII and the three categories are weighed equally to present a balance assessment of gender equality. The GII covers three broad categories of female disadvantage: reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market status.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

The purpose of the index is to demonstrate the loss of human development due to inequalities between men and women. The three categories are measured with the following metrics. Reproductive health is measured by the maternal mortality rate and the adolescent fertility rate. Empowerment is indicated by the share of parliamentary seats held by each sex and secondary and higher education levels of each sex. Finally, the labor market aspect of the GII is measured by women's participation rate in the workforce. Mathematically, it is the approximated loss of human development to women due to inequality.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

Philosophically and methodologically, the GII is based on and, in some sense, a subindicator of the [[Human Development Index]]. Scores for nations are on a scale of 0 to 1 where 0 is pure gender equality and 1 is pure gender inequality. GII is measured in a similar manner as the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index. According to the UN, IHDI is "based on a distribution-sensitive class of composite indices proposed by Foster, Lopez-Calva, and Szekely (2005), which draws on the Atkinson (1970) family of inequality measures. It is computed as the geometric mean of dimension indices adjusted for inequality. The inequality in each dimension is estimated by the Atkinson inequality measure, which is based on the assumption that a society has a certain level of aversion to inequality." &lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

The median GII score for the global community is 0.463. When divided by regions, the Arab States have the third worst GII score of 0.555.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; This score is only superior to the scores of Sub-Saharan Africa (0.577) and South Asia (0.568). While not all encompassing and inclusive of other religious and cultural groups, these three regions, particularly the Arab States and South Asia, are inhabited by large Muslim populations. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Indonesia, and Bangladesh all have GII scores above the median. Only Tunisia's score (0.293) is below the median.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; However, it is significantly below the median.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

Gender inequality, however, is not increasing or decreasing in a collinear fashion among these predominantly Muslim states. In Afghanistan, for example, gender inequality, as measured by the index, improved by 2% from 2005 to 2008 but then declined by 2% from 2008 to 2011. In Iraq, the GII score jumped by 9% from 2005 to 2008 but then leveled off in 2011. Turkey, Indonesia, Tunisia, and Pakistan have seen consistent improves to gender equality since 2005.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; Due to the broad, general nature of the indicators, the minimal and narrow data used to compile the three categories which compose the indicator, and innumerable political and socio-economic issues which may increase or decrease gender inequality, nothing definitive can be said about the level of gender inequality or its growth trend in many predominantly Muslim nations.

== History ==
In 1973, feminist scholar [[Karlyn Kohrs Campbell]] wrote an influential essay, ''The Rhetoric of Women’s Liberation: An Oxymoron'', that drew feminists' attention to women's role as communicators within rhetorical frameworks, and to the relevance of feminist theory to the study of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer | first=Michaela D. E. | title=Women Speak(ing): Forty Years of Feminist Contributions to Rhetoric and an Agenda for Feminist Rhetorical Studies | journal=Communication Quarterly | volume=55 | issue=1 | date=2007-02-27 | issn=0146-3373 | doi=10.1080/01463370600998293 | pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholar [[Patricia Bizzell]] noted in 1992 that classical canon of rhetoric consists almost entirely of well-educated male authors.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bizzell|first1=Patricia|date=1992|title=Opportunities for Feminist Research in the History of Rhetoric|journal=Rhetoric Review|volume=11|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, feminist rhetoric scholars argued that the world of rhetoric was suffused with patriarchal values. To address this perceived problem, they made efforts to include women authors in the history of rhetoric; pointed out connections between feminist issues and theories of rhetoric; and wrote rhetorical criticism from feminist perspectives.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-feminist-rhetoric-1690791|title=Feminist Rhetoric|last1=Nordquist|first1=Richard|website=Thought Co.|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These academics were initially inspired by feminist scholarship outside of rhetoric and composition studies, but eventually developed a distinctive school within this tradition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Following the initial feminist rhetoric movement, the Coalition of Women (later Feminist) Scholars in the History of Rhetoric and Composition was formed in 1988.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to its mission statement, this coalition “fosters inquiry in the histories, theories, and pedagogues of rhetoric and composition” for the "advancement of feminist research".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cwshrc.org/about-us/our-mission/|title=Our Mission|website=Coalition of Feminist Scholars in the History of Rhetoric and Composition|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of teachers and scholars dedicated to promoting the [[intersectionality]] of communication and collaboration within feminist rhetoric and research methods.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Founding members included Winifred Horner, Jan Swearingen, Nan Johnson, Marjone Curry Woods, and Kathleen Welch.&lt;ref name="Ratcliffe"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Ratcliffe |first= Krista |chapter=The Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries |title=Present State of Scholarship in the History of Rhetoric: A Twenty-First Century Guide|editor1=Lynée Lewis Gaillet |editor2=Winifred Bryan Horner |publisher=University of Missouri Press|date=2010 |pages=185–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues with [[Andrea Lunsford]], Jackie Royster, [[Cheryl Glenn (academic)|Cheryl Glenn]], Shirley Logan, and other contemporary feminist writing scholars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 1996 brought the publication of ''Peitho'', the coalition’s newspaper, published by [[Susan Jarratt]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In present day feminist rhetoric, a point of emphasis is changing research methods and methodologies to include the discourse of marginalized groups.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Feminist rhetoric works to expand the rhetorical canon. The rhetorical canon is traditionally composed of five parts: Invention, Arrangement, Style, Memory, and Delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Canons/Canons.htm|title=the canons of rhetoric|website=rhetoric.byu.edu|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were introduced by the Roman orator [[Cicero]] in his treatise ''De Inventione'' around 50 BC. The idea was expanded by the Roman rhetorician [[Quintilian]] 150 years later in ''Institutio Oratoria.'' The rhetorical canon has been used in rhetorical education since its creation. Rhetorical treatises have based their purpose off these canons. Rhetoric is integrated in the education system, which means that students are taught the rhetorical canon as well. Feminist rhetoric scholars argue that this canon, and its methods of persuasion or argument, exclude some valuable forms of public discourse and narrative, and seek to expand it accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Themes ==

=== Methodology in rhetoric studies ===
Scholars, such as Jessica Enoch and Jaqueline Jones Royster, introduced the idea of changing the way research is recognized and constructed. Scholars in rhetoric studies agree there is a plethora of voices and demographics to draw upon for data necessary for research in the field.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enoch|first=Jessica|date=2004|title="Para La Mujer": Defining a Chicana Feminist Rhetoric at the Turn of the Century|url=|journal=College English|volume=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers suggest this is achieved by asking questions that have never been asked before, recognizing the wealth of materials (or lack thereof) in archives, and expanding the idea of an archive.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In recent years, archives have been deconstructed, or critically analyzed, outside of scholarly articles. Feminist rhetorical academics work to develop research methods and methodologies by including new types of archival research such as- yearbooks, small town newspapers, and community contributing archival websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lueck|first=Amy|date=2017|title=Classbook Sense': Genre and Girls' School Yearbooks in the Early-Twenties- Century American High School|url=|journal=College English|volume=79.4|pages=358–383|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global narratives ===
Another main idea in feminist rhetoric is making the point of view, and the rhetorical canon, more expansive than what lies within the United States' domain of discourse.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feminist Rhetorical Practices: New Horizons for  Rhetoric, Composition, and Literacy Studies|last1=Royster|first1=Jacqueline Jones|last2=Kirsch|first2=Gesa E.|date=2012|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist rhetoric scholars ask the questions of how rhetoric, writing studies, and social change intersect, or may be influenced by politics, the economy, religions, cultures, and education.&lt;ref name="Kirsh"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirsch|first=Gesa E.|last2=Royster|first2=Jacqueline J.|date=2010|title=Feminist Rhetorical Practices: In Search of Excellence|jstor=27917867|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=61|issue=4|pages=640–672}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key term used in this field is "[[transnationality]]", defined as the culture of one nation moving through borders to another nation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is used with the terms cultural hybridity and intertextuality, which continue the theory of cultures, texts, and ideas mixing with one another.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Gender ===
Feminist rhetoric works to represent the voices and discourse of genders that go beyond the binary of male and female. [[Transgender]] discourse is another main point of focus in feminist rhetoric, which is recognized by scholars as a lack of privilege some authors have.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rawson|first1=K.J.|last2=Ronald|first2=Kate|date=2010|title=Queering Feminist Rhetorical Canonization|journal=Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies|pages=39–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royster and others have called for research focused on how gender dynamics affect communication, including rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Race and ethnicity ===
[[Race and ethnicity]] is an area of focus for several scholars in feminist rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They have changed research methods to include international races and ethnicity outside the typical rhetoric canon.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Feminist rhetoric focuses on how archiving cultural rhetoric, such as that of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] women, can create a better understanding of the pedagogy of research methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webber|first=Jim|date=2008-10-14|title=A Review of: "Refiguring Rhetorical Education: Women Teaching African American, Native American, and Chicano/a Students, 1865–1911, by Jessica Enoch."|journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly|volume=38|issue=4|pages=467–469|doi=10.1080/02773940802405546|issn=0277-3945}}&lt;/ref&gt; An issue that has arisen in feminist rhetoric is the discourse of colored women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some female scholars of color have written about their perceived need to mask their identity when sharing their voices and opinions.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Sano-Franchini, Jennifer, Donnie Sackey and Stacey Pigg. “Methodological Dwellings: A Search for Feminisms in Rhetoric &amp; Composition.” Present Tense, Vol. 1, Issue 2. Michigan State Univ. Press. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist rhetoric theory works to legitimize the ethnic discourse of women and give it a platform in the academia of rhetoric and writing studies.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

== Challenges ==
Feminist rhetoric scholars have noted the difficulty in including diverse voices in the rhetorical canon.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Scholars have argued that changes in research methods may be needed to better include the voices of those who are disabled, trans, and [[queer]] in rhetoric studies.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Dolmage, Jay, et al. “Refiguring Rhetorica: Linking Feminist Rhetoric and Disability Studies.” ''Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies'', edited by Eileen E. Schell and K. J. Rawson, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pa, 2010, pp. 23–38. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkff8.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite longstanding feminist opposition to processes of canonization as inherently imposing limits and excluding perspectives, feminist rhetoric has begun to develop its own canon of commonly referenced texts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accordingly, feminist rhetoric scholars try to include the works of unknown feminist rhetors in their theorization processes, and develop a gendered analysis or approach that actively includes rhetors who are traditionally excluded from rhetorical canons, such as women of color or low socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Rhetors, along with expanding the feminist rhetorical canon, work to make feminist rhetoric applicable in pedagogy and education. Scholars discuss the importance of research, whether that be changing research methods or looking further into textual research.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some suggest this can be done by theorizing, others want to employ critical imagination.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Addison, Joanne, and Kate Ronald. “Researching Literacy as a Lived Experience.” ''Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies'', edited by Eileen E. Schell and K. J. Rawson, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pa, 2010, pp. 136–151. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkff8.13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Theory as a research method approaches discourse from different communities as a generalized idea that allows people to participate in the world through rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Feminist rhetoric sees theory in this sense as a form for people to speak out and be included in the rhetorical canon. Critical imagination is using the silence, or lack of work from feminist rhetors, to extrapolate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Scholars discuss how this involves understanding that there is more to not only feminist rhetoric, but feminist practice in theory, than what is written down in textbooks or history. Scholars, such as Royster and Kirsch, acknowledge that feminist rhetoric needs to draw from the silence to help set a new precedent for rhetorical practices in the future.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A part of critical imagination is knowing that the documentation of rhetoric thus far isn’t the only important rhetoric that should contribute to pedagogy.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Eves, Rosalyn. “Landmark Essays on Rhetoric and Feminism, 1973–2000 ed. by Cheryl Glenn and Andrea Lunsford (Review)” ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs'', Volume 19, Number 4. pp. 705-708. Michigan State Univ. Press. Winter 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
A goal of feminist rhetoric is to be viewed as a rhetorical theory of writing as opposed to a social theory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Micciche, Laura R., and Kate Ronald. “Writing as Feminist Rhetorical Theory.” ''Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies'', edited by Eileen E. Schell and K. J. Rawson, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pa, 2010, pp. 173–188. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkff8.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Feminist rhetoric seeks to influence the pedagogy of writing in high school and other levels of academia.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Scholars in the field of feminist rhetoric seek to open academic discourse and pedagogy of rhetoric to all types of people.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

{{Semiotics}}
'''Film semiotics''' is the [[semiotics]] of [[film]]; the study of signs as they pertain to film on a variety of levels.

== Early semioticians of film ==
*  [[Ricciotto Canudo]] – Italian writer working in the 1920s, identified “''language-like character of cinema''”.&lt;ref name="Stam"&gt;Stam, R., Burgoyne, R., &amp; Lewis, S. (1992). New vocabularies in film semiotics: structuralism, post-structuralism, and beyond. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Louis Delluc]] – French writer, working in the 1920s, wrote of the ability of film to transcend national language.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;
* [[Vachel Lindsay]] – referred to film as “''hieroglyphic language''”.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;
* [[Béla Balázs]] – Hungarian film theorist who wrote about language-like nature of film from the 1920s to the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

== Russian formalism (1910s–1930s) ==

[[Yury Tynyanov]] was a Russian writer and literary critic. [[Boris Eichenbaum]] outlined principles of syntagmatic construction. (see: [[syntagmatic analysis]]) Syntagmatic analysis deals with sequence and structure, as opposed to the paradigm emphasis of [[paradigmatic analysis]]. The cinema, for Eichenbaum, is a “''particular of figurative language,” the stylistics of which would treat filmic “syntax,” the linkage of shots in “phrases” and “sentences.''””  &lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

Eichenbaum and Tynyanov had two different approaches to interpreting the signs of film. ''"Tynyanov spoke of the cinema as offering the visible world in the form of semantic signs engendered by cinematic procedures such as lighting and montage, while Eichenbaum saw film in relation to “inner speech” and “image translations of linguistic tropes.''”" &lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

== Structuralism and post-structuralism (1950s–present) ==
The film-language concept was explored more deeply in the 1960s when [[post-structuralist]] thinkers started to criticize [[structuralism]]. Also, semiotics became popular in academia. Early work in this field dealt with “''contrasting arbitrary signs of natural language with the motivated, iconic signs of the cinema''”.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

* [[Umberto Eco]] – Italian novelist and semiotician
* [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] – Italian director and writer
* [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]] – French film theorist
* [[Roland Barthes]] – French literary theorist

== Concepts ==
'''Denotation and connotation'''

Film communicates meaning denotatively and connotatively. What the audience sees and hears is denotative, it is what it is and they don’t have to strive to recognize it.  At the same time these sounds and images are connotative and the way the scene is shot is meant to evoke certain feelings from the viewer.  Connotation typically involves emotional overtones, objective interpretation, social values, and ideological assumptions.  According to Christian Metz, “The study of connotation brings us closer to the notion of the cinema as an art (the “seventh art”).” &lt;ref name="Metz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metz|first1=Christian|title=Film language: A semiotics of the cinema|date=1974|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within connotations, paradigmatic connotations exist, which would be a shot that is being compared with its unrealized companions in the paradigm. A low angle shot of a rose conveys a sense that the flower is somehow dominant or overpowering because we unconsciously compare it with an overhead shot of a rose which would diminish its importance.  Syntagmatic connotation would not compare the rose shot to other potential shots but compare it with actual shots that precede or follow it. The meaning adheres to it because its compared to other shots we actually see.&lt;ref name="Monaco"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Monaco|first1=James|title=How to read a film: the world of movies, media, and multimedia: language, history, theory.|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narrative'''

Narrative is generally known as having two components; the story presented and the process of telling it, or narration, often referred to as narrative discourse. Film narrative theory seeks to uncover the apparently “motivated” and “natural” relationship between the signifier and the story-world in order to reveal the deeper system of cultural associations and relationships that are expressed through narrative form.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt; As Roland Barthes has said, “narrative may be transmitted through oral or written language; through static or moving images, through gestures and through an organized mixture of all these substances. There is narrative in myth, legend, fables, fairytales, novellas, novels, history, novel, epos, tragedy, drama, comedy, pantomime, pictures, comics, events and conversation. In these unlimited forms, narrative exists at all times, in all corners of the earth, in all societies. Narrative begins with the history of mankind.” Films use a combination of dialog, sounds, visual images, gestures and actions to create the narrative. Narrators, usually in a voice-over format, are very popular in documentary film and greatly assist in telling the story while accompanying powerful shots.

'''Tropes'''

Metonymy refers to the ability of a sign to represent something entirely, while literally only being a part of it.  An example of this is the Eiffel Tower, which is a metonym for Paris. Film uses metonyms frequently because they rely on the external to reveal the internal. Another powerful semiotic tool for filmmaking is the use of metaphors, which are defined as a comparison between two things that are unrelated but share some common characteristics. In film, a pair of consecutive shots is metaphorical when there is an implied comparison of the two shots. For instance, a shot of an airplane followed by a shot of a bird flying would be metaphorical, implying that the airplane is (or is like) a bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics for Beginners|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important and notable works ==
'''Umberto Eco’s ''Articulations of The Cinematic Code'' (1976)'''

Umberto Eco’s research dealt with the semiology of visual codes using the work of Metz and Pasolini as a starting point. Eco viewed the task of semiology as important and radical. “''Semiology shows us the universe of ideologies, arranged in codes and sub-codes, within the universe of signs, and these ideologies are reflected in our preconstituted ways of using the language.''” &lt;ref name="Eco" /&gt;

Triple articulation codes consist of figures, signs and elements. Eco assumed that the cinematic codes are the only ones using triple articulation. Where current linguistic conventions might use two axes, the paradigmatic and the syntagmatic, the triple articulation can use [[kinesics]] to identify discrete units of time.&lt;ref name="Eco"&gt;Eco, U. (1970). Articulations of the Cinematic Code. Cinematics, 1(1), 590-605.&lt;/ref&gt; Articulations are introduced into a code to communicate the maximum number of combinable elements. Because we normally experience non-articulated and double-articulated codes, running across a code with triple articulation can be overwhelming. “''The contextual wealth of this combination makes the cinema a richer form of communication than speech.''” &lt;ref name="Eco"/&gt;

'''Summary of codes'''&lt;ref name="Eco"/&gt;

1. Perceptive codes

2. Codes of recognition

3. Codes of transmission

4. Tonal codes

5. Iconic codes (figures, signs and semes)

6. Iconographic codes

7. Codes of taste and sensibility

8. Rhetorical codes

9. Stylistic codes

10. Codes of the unconscious

'''Christian Metz’s ''Film Language: A Semiotics of Cinema'' (1974''')

This collection of Metz’s writings on cinematographic problems was informed by insights from [[structural linguistics]].
“''The study of the cinema as an art – the study of cinematographic expressiveness – can therefore be conducted according to methods derived from linguistics...through its procedures of denotation, the cinema is a specific language''” &lt;ref&gt;Metz, C. (1974). Film language; a semiotics of the cinema. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Stam, Robert Burgoyne, and Sandy Flitterman-Lewis’s ''New Vocabularies in Film Semiotics: Structuralism, Post-structuralism, and Beyond'' (1992)'''

This work highlighted film semiotics as a new tool in art criticism. The book provided an overview of previous thinkers and defined terms critical to semiotic film theory. “''This book is intended as a didactic introduction to the vocabulary of the field, not as a series of interventions in film theory''” &lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part One ''The Origins of Semiotics'''''

Semiotics must be viewed through the broader context of the linguistic nature of contemporary thought.

"''The overarching meta-discipline of semiotics...can be seen as a local manifestation of a more widespread "linguistic turn," an attempt to reconceptualize the world "through" linguistics.''"&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part Two ''Cine-semiology'''''

Dealt with the cinematic sign, The Grand Syntagmatic, textual systems and analysis, semiotics of filmic sound, language in the cinema.

'''Part Three ''Film-narratology'''''

Taking cues from structuralism and [[Russian Formalism]], film narrative theory attempts to "''designate the basic structures of story processes and to define the aesthetic languages unique to film narrative discourse.''"&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part Four ''Psychoanalysis'''''

The relationship between human psyche and cinematic representation is explored. "''One of the aims, therefore, of psychoanalytic film theory is a systematic comparison of the cinema as a specific kind of spectacle and the structure of the socially and psychically constituted individual.''"&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part Five ''From realism to intertextuality'''''

Describes the evolution from an emphasis on realism in the 1950s to the [[intertextuality]] of the 1970s.

The '''ancient synagogue of Gaza''' was built in 508 AD during the [[Byzantine]] period and was discovered in 1965. It was located in the ancient port city of Gaza, then known as "[[Maiuma]]s", currently the [[Rimal]] district of [[Gaza City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HQyxvmYV-50C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Ancient synagogues''].

==History==
[[Image:PikiWiki Israel 15077 Mosaic from the ancient synagogue in Gaza.JPG|thumb|Section of the synagogue's mosaic floor]]
In 1965, [[Egypt]]ian archaeologists discovered the site and announced they had uncovered a church.&lt;ref&gt;Connie Kestenbaum Green.

[[File:Project Physics Text cover.jpg|thumb|''Project Physics'', cover, main text]]
'''Harvard Project Physics''', also called '''Project Physics''', was a national [[curriculum development]] project to create a [[secondary school]] [[physics education]] program in the United States during the [[Cold War]] era. 

==History==
The project was active from 1962 to 1972, and produced the ''Project Physics'' series of texts, which were used in physics classrooms in the 1970s and 1980s. The project was centered at [[Harvard University]], but drew from schools and educators from across the country. The directors of this project were: [[F. James Rutherford]], project coordinator (and after completion of the project, professor of [[science education]] at [[New York University]]); [[Gerald Holton]], professor of physics and of the [[history of science]] at Harvard University; and [[Fletcher Watson|Fletcher G. Watson]], professor of science education at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]].

==Course materials==
Project Physics course work was broken into six main subject areas, organized into separate books each called a "Project Physics Text and Handbook" or "Student Guide":&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/projectphysicscollection Project Physics Collection at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

#Concepts of Motion
#Motion in the Heavens
#The Triumph of Mechanics
#Light and Electromagnetism
#Models of the Atom 
#The Nucleus

The books presented the material from a historical perspective, with aspects of human interest wrapped into the text. The intent was to build a sophisticated conceptual understanding of physics, while not over-simplifying the curriculum. Frequent references to historical works where concepts were first discovered and debated highlighted the drive to make physics a fundamental search for understanding of the universe.&lt;ref name="AOTS"&gt;{{cite web|title=High School Reform Projects: Physics|url=http://artofteachingscience.org/mos/5.2.html|website=artofteachingscience.org|accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The course materials also included readers, tests, and other teaching aids. The course readers allowed students to further explore a topic, and lab exercises enabled students to verify that their understanding was confirmed by experimental outcomes. Special lab equipment, brief film loops, films, and a teacher's guide were also developed.&lt;ref name="AOTS" /&gt; The texts and all other aids are now available for free on the Project Physics Collection web site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9035">'''Hypermobile''' travelers are "highly mobile individuals" who take "frequent trips, often over great distances." They "account for a large share of the overall kilometres travelled, especially by air."&lt;ref name="gossling"/&gt; These people contribute significantly to the overall amount of [[airmiles]] flown within a given society.&lt;ref&gt;Høyer, K. G. and Næss, P. (2001). Sustainable Tourism or Sustainable Mobility? The Norwegian Case. ''Journal of Sustainable Tourism'', 8, 147-160. ''[http://www.informaworld.com/index/908038833.pdf]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Although concerns over hypermobility apply to several modes of transport, the [[environmental impact of aviation]] and especially its [[greenhouse gas emissions]] have brought particular focus on flying.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson K, Bows A (2008).  Reframing the climate change challenge in light of post-2000 emission trends. ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences]]'' (366:1882, p.3863-3882). ''[http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/366/1882/3863.full]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson K (2008). (Presentation slides): Reframing climate change: from long-term targets to emission pathways. ''[http://transitionculture.org/wp-content/uploads/kevin-anderson-2.ppt]''&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons for this focus is that these emissions, because they are made at high altitude, have a climate impact that is commonly estimated to be 2.7 higher than the same emissions if made at ground-level.&lt;ref&gt;Peeters, P. &amp; Williams, V. 2009. Calculating emissions and radiative forcing. P.76 in: Gössling, S. &amp; Upham, P (Eds.), 2009. ''Climate change and aviation: Issues, challenges and solutions''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the amount of time people have spent in motion has remained constant since 1950, the shift from feet and bicycles to cars and planes has increased the speed of travel fivefold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olis.oecd.org/olis/1999doc.nsf/63c71d2d4054d0fdc125685d0053aee4/c125685b002f5004c125686b005cb510/$FILE/00071363.PDF#page=95|pages=118|author=John Adams|title=Proceedings from the Ottawa Workshop - OECD|date=19 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This results in the twin effects of wider and shallower regions of social activity around each person (further exacerbated by electronic communication which can be seen as a form of virtual mobility), and a degradation of the social and physical environment brought about by the high speed traffic (as theorised by urban designer [[Donald Appleyard]]).

The changes are brought about locally due to the use of cars and motorways, and internationally by aeroplanes.  Some of the social threats of hypermobility include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/558292.stm|title=Hypermobility: The road to ruin|date=11 December 1999|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Illinois College''' is a private, liberal arts college in [[Jacksonville, Illinois]].  It is affiliated with the [[United Church of Christ]] and the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].  It was the second college founded in Illinois, but the first to grant a degree (in 1835). It was founded in 1829 by the Illinois Band, students from Yale University who traveled westward to found new colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_YaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=%22Illinois+Band%22+from+yale&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NAgykfOWgw&amp;sig=pGIfdWoQkJUVGNDaIE2B-jDGXq8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0PjdSZO2FYLwMpSZqOcJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Illinois%20Band%22%20from%20yale&amp;f=false |title=The record of the celebration of the ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2008-05-19 |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqkaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA291&amp;lpg=PA291&amp;dq=%22Yale+Band%22+founding+colleges&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ENgHzg8qjo&amp;sig=r-0j8azqszYL1VJqtGX4HzCEJXk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HPjdSeawA43CMfGvzOYJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Yale%20Band%22%20founding%20colleges&amp;f=false |title=Historical encyclopedia of Illinois - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2008-05-13 |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It briefly served as the state's first medical school, from 1843 to 1848, and became co-educational in 1903.

==History==
The [[Rev. John M. Ellis]], a [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian]] missionary in the East, saw the need for a “seminary of learning” in the new state of Illinois. His plans drew the attention of [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] students at [[Yale University]], and seven of them, in one of the famous “Yale Bands,” came westward to help found the College.

The first president of Illinois College was [[Edward Beecher]] who left his position at the [[Park Street Church]] in [[Boston]] and firmly imbued the new College with [[New England]] traditions and academic foundations. His sister, [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], was later the author of the influential anti-slavery novel ''[[Uncle Tom’s Cabin]]'' and a visitor to the campus.  His brother, [[Henry Ward Beecher]], preached and lectured at the college as well. [[Beecher Hall]], named in honor of president Beecher, was the first building constructed on the Illinois College campus, and remains the oldest college building in the state of Illinois. [[File:Beecher Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Beecher Hall is the oldest college building in the state of Illinois.]]

The first two college graduates in the state of Illinois, [[Richard Yates (19th century politician)|Richard Yates]] and [[Jonathan E. Spilman]], received their degrees from Illinois College in 1835.  Yates became the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] governor of Illinois and later a U.S. senator. A program at Illinois College for first generation college students was named The Yates Fellowship Program in his honor.  Jonathan Edwards Spilman composed the familiar music to [[Robert Burns]]’ poem “Flow Gently, [[Sweet Afton]].”

[[William Jennings Bryan]], a member of the class of 1881, is one of the most prominent alumni of Illinois College.  He was a [[United States Congressman]] from Nebraska, the [[US Secretary of State]], and the Democratic Party's presidential nominee in 1896, 1900, and 1908.

Many Illinois College graduates have gone on to have influential careers in public service. Two graduates became U.S. senators, 20 became congressmen, six were state governors and two currently serve as federal judges.

Among the visitors and lecturers on campus during the early years were [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Horace Greeley]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Wendell Phillips]]. Many speakers, including Lincoln, were sponsored by the college’s literary societies which still exist today.

Illinois College was a center of the abolitionist movement due to its Northern location near the [[Mississippi River]] and outspoken campus leaders such as President Edward Beecher and Professor [[Jonathan Baldwin Turner]].  In the mid 1800s, a group of students at the college were indicted by a grand jury for harboring runaway slaves.  Two campus buildings also have ties to the abolitionist movement; Beecher Hall is believed to have been part of the Underground Railroad, and a campus house, the Gillett House, has attained the prestigious [[National Park Service]] certification as a “National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom” site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/ntf_member/ntf_member_results.htm?SPFTerritory=Illinois&amp;SPFType=NULL&amp;SPFKeywords=By%20Keyword...&amp;as_sfid=AAAAAAWOlrcb9q6bXOqFsrdFMFiKEM2OMrQ7V84FElwW6Ka3ecPa4oVOBeQ4TFNhz8Jazba+IDpcwaRsrJQ2lbJ/UGZSPRmFfuypogDv2mjjXXCKlA==&amp;as_fid=TebFfX/s/1MtM/5KX4A7|title=Member Search Results|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College became co-educational in 1903 by incorporating the '''Jacksonville Female Academy''' (founded 1830), and in 1906 IC awarded degrees to its first four female graduates. Illinois Conservatory of Music (founded 1871) was also absorbed in 1903.  In 1932 the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] established a chapter at Illinois College, and it remains one of only 11 chapters in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.edu/aboutus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040927102926/http://www.ic.edu/aboutus/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 September 2004|title=Illinois College -&gt; About Us|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Jacksonville (Illinois)|display=Jacksonville, a city and the county-seat of Morgan county, Illinois, U.S.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bruner Fitness and Recreation Center===

The Bruner Fitness Center was constructed in 2003 and is the primary location for athletic events at Illinois College. The three level building includes two racquetball courts, a fitness center, classrooms, offices, and a multipurpose room.  The building also houses the college swimming center and the Sherman Gymnasium which has seating for 1,600 spectators.  The fieldhouse section of the building includes a 200-meter indoor track and four multipurpose courts for basketball, volleyball, and tennis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hastingschivetta.com/projects/bruner-fitness-and-recreation-center/|title=Bruner Fitness and Recreation Center - Hastings+Chivetta|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is surrounded by a 400-meter all-weather track with pits for pole vault, long jump, and steeplechase.  Lights to illuminate the field were added to the stadium in the fall of 2014.

The Bruner Fitness Center is also located in close proximity to the college tennis courts, baseball field, softball field, and auxiliary soccer field.

==Campus==

The Illinois College campus consists of 80 acres of land located centrally within the town of Jacksonville.  The land the campus occupies is higher in elevation than many of the other areas in Jacksonville, and IC is therefore sometimes referred to as “On the Hilltop”, or “The Hilltop”.

The primary section of campus is divided into two areas commonly called the upper and lower quads.  The upper quad is on the northern part of the campus, and is higher in elevation than the lower quad which is located on the southern part of the campus.

The upper quad is the location of many of the academic buildings. This includes the notable Sturtevant Hall which is often featured in pictures because of its unique towers and windows which are currently found in the College logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.edu/RelId/625107/ISvars/default/Style_Guide.htm |title=Illinois College, a private Phi Beta Kappa liberal arts college in Jacksonville, IL |publisher=Ic.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Sturtevant.jpg|thumb|left|Sturtevant Hall photographed from the upper quad.]]

Other buildings on the Upper Quad include Crampton Residence Hall, which was once the oldest continuously used dormitory in the state. It was closed as a residence hall in May 2006, and re-opened in August 2011 after renovations had been made. Whipple Hall, which was once a preparatory school, underwent renovations, and is now the home to the Al Habtoor Leadership Center, [[Paul Findley|Congressman Paul Findley's]] Congressional Office, and the Communication and Rhetorical Studies department. [[William Jennings Bryan]] carved his initials into a Whipple Hall banister while he was a student, and the initials can still be found on the building along with a commemorative plaque. Tanner Hall, built for the College's centennial, once housed the library. It now houses administrative offices including the Academic Dean’s Office, the Business Office, the Office of Business Affairs, and the Enrollment Offices.  [[Beecher Hall]], the first college building erected in Illinois, is named after the College's first president, [[Edward Beecher]], sibling to [[Henry Ward Beecher]] and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].  The first floor of Beecher Hall is the home of [[Phi Alpha Literary Society]]. The second floor is the home to [[Sigma Pi Literary Society]]. It was named to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The lower quad is the newer section of campus where many of the residence halls are located along with the Caine Student Center.  Just south of the lower quad is the Bruner Fitness Center as well as the athletic fields for football, soccer, baseball, softball, and tennis.

The upper and lower quads are separated by the Steuer Walkway.  Originally, a section of Mound Avenue ran through the campus and provided the separation between the upper and lower quads.  Eventually, the section of Mound Avenue running through campus was closed off and the Steuer Walkway was constructed to unify the campus and eliminate traffic concerns for students walking between the quads.

===Residential Life===
[[File:Lincoln Hall.jpg|thumb|Lincoln Hall dormitory photographed from the lower quad.]]
Eight residential halls are located on the Illinois College campus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.edu/RelId/614348/ISvars/default/Buildings.htm|title=Illinois College -&gt; Business Affairs -&gt; Facilities Management -&gt; Buildings|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the residence halls, Illinois College owns and maintains an apartment building close to campus which serves as housing for upperclassmen.

===Activities===

There are over 80 different clubs and organizations established at Illinois College.  Of those, there are three main organizations which help provide campus wide programming and governing:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.edu/studentorganizations|title=Illinois College -&gt; Campus Life -&gt; Student Involvement -&gt; Student Organizations|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student Activities Board (SAB): Consists of six student-run committees dedicated to providing programming to the Illinois College community.  SAB sponsored events include comedians, bands, community service projects, trips, lectures, dances, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.edu/SAB|title=Illinois College -&gt; Campus Life -&gt; Student Involvement -&gt; Student Activities Board|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homecoming Committee: Homecoming has been a long-standing tradition at Illinois College.  Each year, the Homecoming Committee helps plan the pep rally, Powder Puff Football games, parade, formal dance, and an event called Follies which features the talents of students.  Class games are often held during Homecoming Week as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.edu/homecoming|title=Homecoming 2016|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek Organizations===

Illinois College is home to a number of Greek organizations. Along with the many academically affiliated Greek organizations, Illinois College also houses a number of national recognized Greek organizations such as [[Alpha Phi Omega]]; the co-ed service fraternity that is the largest collegiate fraternity in the United States. 

Illinois College is one of the few campuses in the United States that still supports literary societies. These are Greek organizations whose purposes vary from society to society.  Activities include but are not limited to: Literary Productions, intramural sports teams, service events, and social gatherings.

There are four men’s literary societies at Illinois College.  They are: [[Sigma Pi (literary society)|Sigma Pi]], [[Phi Alpha Literary Society|Phi Alpha]], [[Gamma Nu]], and Pi Pi Rho. Phi Alpha and Sigma Pi are both located in Beecher Hall (Phi Alpha on the first level and Sigma Pi on the second). Gamma Nu is located in lower Baxter Hall and Pi Pi Rho is currently in a temporary house.

There are three women's societies at Illinois College.  They are: Gamma Delta, [[Sigma Phi Epsilon Literary Society|Sigma Phi Epsilon]], and Chi Beta.  All three female societies are housed in the historic Smith House.

Society pledging was suspended during 2012 after three "serious incidents” including  what  college officials described as "dangerous practices". One society pledge was sent to a hospital after receiving life-threatening injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sj-r.com/x715336088/Illinois-College-cancels-literary-society-pledging-3-students-hospitalized |title=IC stops literary society pledging after students hospitalized - The State Journal Register |publisher=http://www.sj-r.com |date=2012-01-31 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abraham Lincoln Connection==

The Illinois College campus and alumni shared many connections with Abraham Lincoln during his life.  
While Lincoln never received a formal college education, it is documented that he was tutored by William and Lynn Greene who were brothers and students at Illinois College.  The brothers would share with Lincoln, through books and notes, what they had learned from Illinois College professor [[Jonathan Baldwin Turner]].
Lincoln later practiced law in [[Springfield, Illinois]] where he was the partner and mentor of Illinois College alumnus [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ic.edu/Customized/uploads/Lincoln_A_Logical_Alma_Mater.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310184200/http://www.ic.edu/Customized/uploads/Lincoln_A_Logical_Alma_Mater.pdf |archive-date=2014-03-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law office they shared together can still be seen in the [[Central Springfield Historic District]] of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visit-springfieldillinois.com/Things-To-Do/Attractions/Details.aspx?id=20|title=Visit Springfield Illinois - Travel &amp; Tourism - Official Site|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, a statue of Abraham Lincoln was dedicated on the Illinois College campus, and he was posthumously awarded a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sj-r.com/x536354138/Lincoln-statue-dedicated-at-Illinois-College|title=Lincoln statue dedicated at Illinois College|first=John|last=Reynolds|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also received honorary degrees from [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]], [[Columbia University]], and [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/education/glance.htm|title=Brief Profile of Abraham Lincoln|publisher=|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Intelligent Community Forum''' ('''ICF'''), a non-profit policy research organization, focuses on job creation and economic development in the [[broadband]] economy.  It highlights on the economic effects of broadband, community-based best practices, and annual Intelligent Community Awards.

== Mission ==
[[File:Rob-van-gijzel-1302612764.jpg|thumb|150px|ICF Foundation Chairman [[Rob van Gijzel|van Gijzel]]|alt=]]
The Intelligent Community Forum is a think tank that studies the economic and social development of the 21st-century community. Whether in industrialized or developing nations, communities are challenged to create prosperity, stability and cultural meaning in a world where jobs, investment and knowledge increasingly depend on advances in communications. For the 21st-century community, connectivity is a double-edge sword: threatening established ways of life on the one hand, and offering powerful new tools to build prosperous, inclusive and environmentally sustainable economies on the other. ICF seeks to share the best practices of the world's Intelligent Communities in adapting to the demands of the Broadband Economy, in order to help communities everywhere find sustainable renewal and growth. ICF conducts [https://web.archive.org/web/20100120064417/http://intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?src=gendocs&amp;ref=Research_Intelligent_Community_Indicators&amp;category=Research research], creates [https://web.archive.org/web/20090220124337/http://intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?src=gendocs&amp;ref=BBE08Summit&amp;category=Events conference content], publishes [https://web.archive.org/web/20100221005726/http://www.intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?submenu=Research&amp;src=gendocs&amp;ref=Research_White_Papers&amp;category=Research information] and presents [https://web.archive.org/web/20100221005729/http://www.intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?src=gendocs&amp;ref=Awards_Program&amp;category=Events annual awards], all in an effort to:

*Identify and explain the emergence of the broadband economy and its impact at the local level.  This is the new global economy emerging from the deployment of broadband on the international, national and local levels around the world.  The broadband economy challenges us all, whether we live in a thriving metropolitan area or a poor rural region.  In the broadband economy, adaptability outweighs legacy; skills, not resources, are the key to future; and [[innovation]], not location, creates a competitive advantage.
*Research and share best practices by communities in adapting to the changing economic environment and positioning their citizens and businesses to prosper.  There is no "one best model" for economic development in the broadband economy.  Each successful community develops strategies based on its unique history and challenges, and overcomes specific local obstacles to put programs into place.  But successful strategies share many common elements, and communities can learn enormous amounts from each other's successes and failures, and by sharing with others, speed their own development as well.
*Celebrate the achievements of communities that have overcome challenges to claim a place in the economy of the 21st century.  Communities around the world are making huge strides to overcome legacy challenges, develop strategies and put effective programs and policies into place.  ICF celebrates leadership through an Awards program that searches the globe for the best models of each year and publicizes their achievements.

For ICF, a "community" is a town, village, city or metropolitan area – or occasionally a state, province or other larger region – that has a distinct identity and the ability to act in a unified manner as a single entity.  Its citizens and businesses identify themselves with that community enough to set aside small-scale differences and cooperate for the good of the whole.

== Awards ==

Since 1999, ICF has presented annual awards to the Intelligent Community, Intelligent Building, Intelligent Community Technology and Intelligent Community Visionary of the Year. Winners receive an award, a presentation photograph and assistance with promoting the award to their customers, constituents and stakeholders.

The Intelligent Community Awards are presented at ICF's annual [http://www.icfsummit.com Summit] conference in New York City, produced in association with [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1895">[[File:Israel  Lewy cropped.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Rabbi Dr. Israel Lewy]]
'''Israel Lewy''' (7 January 1841 – 8 September 1917) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Jew]]ish scholar.  
==Biography==
He was educated at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau|Jewish Theological Seminary]] and the [[University of Breslau|University]] in [[Breslau]]. In 1874 he was appointed [[docent]] at the Lehranstalt für die [[Wissenschaft des Judenthums]] in [[Berlin]], and in 1883, on the death of [[David Joël]], he was called to the seminary at Breslau. Lewy's knowledge of [[Talmud|Talmudic literature]] was unusually wide; he was endowed also with an exceptionally acute and dispassionate critical spirit and with a faculty for grasping the proper importance of details. 

His first publication was ''Ueber Einige Fragmente aus der Mischna des Abba Saul'' (Berlin, 1876), in which he showed that the [[Mishnah]] collections of the foremost teachers in the period before the final redaction of the Mishnah itself, including that of [[Abba Saul]], agreed as regards all the essential points of the [[Halakha]]. 

''Ein Wort über die Mechilta des R. Simon'' (Breslau, 1889) was likewise an authoritative work in the field of halakhic exegesis. Lewy also published ''Interpretation des Ersten, Zweiten und Dritten Abschnitts des [[Jerusalem Talmud|Palästinischen Talmud]]-[[Nezikin|Traktates Nesikin]]'' (ib. 1895-1902), and ''Ein Vortrag über das Ritual des [[Passover|Pesach]]-Abends'' (ib. 1904).

The '''''Journal of Political Ecology''''' is an annual [[open access]] [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering [[political ecology]]. It was established in 1994 as one of the first open access journals in the social sciences, by James B. Greenberg and Thomas K. Park ([[University of Arizona]]), to experiment with online formats and to showcase new work in the emerging field of political ecology. The current [[editors-in-chief]] are Simon P.J. Batterbury ([[Lancaster University]] and [[University of Melbourne]]) and Casey Walsh ([[University of California, Santa Barbara]]). There is an international editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/Masthead.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Unlike the majority of academic journals it is produced free of charge for readers and authors using voluntary academic labour, and its website is hosted at the University of Arizona library. There is no journal budget and editorial work is voluntary. JPE is abstracted and indexed in [[Scopus]], and the number of articles published, and citation index, has risen substantially since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecologiapolitica.info/?p=3564&lt;/ref&gt; The journal publishes Eric Wolf Prize papers submitted by early career scholars to the [[Society for Applied Anthropology]] annual meetings in the United States. The journal is a founding member of the ''Free Journal Network'' &lt;ref&gt;https://freejournals.org/ Free Journal Network&lt;/ref&gt; that supports and lobbies for quality open access publishing.

==Scope==
The scope of the journal is research into the linkages between [[political economy]] and [[human impact on the environment]], particularly where there are inequalities in access to resources, or an increase in vulnerability, as a result of resource use or assertion of political power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4754">[[Image:KeysNotes.jpg|thumb|This is what the system looks like on an actual keyboard.]]
A '''keyboard tablature''' is a [[tablature]] for a [[keyboard instrument]] such as the [[piano]]. The most common keyboard tablature is written using letters and numbers that designate the timing and keys to hit on a keyboard or piano.

Modern piano tablature is based on [[scientific pitch notation]], a variation of [[letter notation]] which has roots going back to the 11th century when Italian [[Guido of Arezzo]] developed [[Solfege]].

== Piano tab notation ==

An example of modern piano tab notation, the scale of F played on 2 octaves:
&lt;pre&gt;
3|--------c-d-e-f-|
2|f-g-a-A---------|
2|--------c-d-e-f-|
1|f-g-a-A---------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some of the rules for this keyboard tablature are:
* The numbers on the left (3, 2, 2 and 1 in the above example) indicate the octave. All octaves start on the c key. Octave 4 is in the middle of the keyboard (starting on c4, or [[middle C]]).
* Lowercase letters (a, b, c, d, e, f, g) indicate the note names as natural (white keys).
* Uppercase letters (A, C, D, F, G) indicate the note names as sharp (black keys). Using the hash symbol # is also acceptable (A#, C#, D#, F#, G#) but not recommended because it takes extra space.
* The | symbols separate measures or sections of notes.
* The - symbols are used for spacing.

Another example of piano tab notation, the chords E, F, and G:
&lt;pre&gt;
   E   F   G
3|---|-c-|-d-|
2|-b-|-a-|-b-|
2|-G-|-f-|-g-|
2|-e-|---|---|
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Periodic system ==

Another keyboard tablature (though less frequently seen) is based on a periodic system of numbers, like most modern tablatures, although incorporating negative and positive numbers assigned to the [[clef]]s (as positive for the [[treble clef]] and negative for the [[bass clef]]). This particular method uses the [[middle C]] as the reference point. Unlike many tab forms the keyboard tab has far different placement values, meaning, regardless of the arrangement of the numbers it can still have the same value, but is displayed differently.

=== Visual example ===
&lt;pre&gt;
12   12    12    12   12  12   12    12
07   07    07    07   09  09   09    09
04   04    04    04   04  04   04    04
   0    0   0     0    0   0    0     0
          -12 -8 -7 -5       -3   -3    -3
P-----------X          P-----------X
&lt;/pre&gt;

(a basic C, Am/C, progression)

=== How to compile ===

The numbers are projected and arranged by value. The particular number is placed in the corresponding column; however, columns are "pushed upward" when notating chords. This "column" system is not affective of the tab itself, more so the appearance, thus it is basically irrelevant. 
* Column 4 = Double digit positive numbers (10+)
* Column 3 = Double digit positive numbers (0-09)
* Column 2 = Single digit negative numbers (-1,-9)
* Column 1 = Double digit negative numbers (-10+)

=== Special notations ===
* A [[grace note]] is shown using smaller numbers as the grace notes, relative to basic music notation. Example: &lt;sup&gt;0 05&lt;/sup&gt; 12
* A [[glissando]] is shown with the start location of the gliss and the stop location. Example: 32------0
* A tremble, rapid alternating between two notes, is indicated with equals signs. Example: 5=====12
* Pedal use is indicated with the P and X characters. This shows when the pedal is held (---) and when released (X). P-------X
* An inaudible or hard to hear note is indicated with parenthesis. Example: (12)

== DecPlay system ==

Another keyboard tablature that has been awarded a US patent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thinkbusiness.ie/articles/play-piano-in-one-hour/|title=A dream invention turns into a business|last=Bryne|first=Brendan|date=1 October 2016|work=Bank of Ireland - Think Business|access-date=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the DecPlay method, which uses a series of numbers, patterns and colours to enable users to play chords and melodies quickly, has been featured on the BBC and is used in over 70 different countries. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/business-news/decplay-hits-the-right-note-879218|title=Decplay hits the right note|last=|first=|date=18 January 2013|work=Manchester Evening News|access-date=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Higher Criticism|historical-critical]] analysis, the '''L source''' is an inferred oral tradition which [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] used when composing [[Gospel of Luke|his gospel]].&lt;ref name = "5GIntro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Brice|title=Matthean and Lukan Special Material: A Brief Introduction with Texts in Greek and English|year=2011|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-61097-737-1|url=https://wipfandstock.com/store/Matthean_and_Lukan_Special_Material_A_Brief_Introduction_with_Texts_in_Greek_and_English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the [[virgin birth of Jesus]] and many of Jesus' best loved [[Parables of Jesus|parables]]. Like [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]'s unique source, known as [[M-Source|M]], the L source has important parables.&lt;ref name = "5GIntro"&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The five gospels.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1993. "Introduction," p 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Two which appear in L are the [[Good Samaritan]] and the [[Prodigal Son]].&lt;ref name = "5GIntro"/&gt; [[I. Howard Marshall]] states "Luke rightly regarded these sources as reliable".&lt;ref&gt; IVP New Testament Commentary 21st century edition pp 979&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Four Document Hypothesis]], Luke combined [[Mark's Gospel|Mark]], the [[Q source]], and L to produce his gospel.&lt;ref name = "5GIntro"/&gt; The material in L, like that in M, probably comes from the oral tradition.&lt;ref name = "5GIntro"/&gt; Luke's special material composes nearly half of his gospel.&lt;ref name = "TM1998 2"&gt;Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide. Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition). Chapter 2. Christian sources about Jesus.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of how to explain the similarities among the Gospels Matthew, Mark, and Luke is known as the [[synoptic problem]]. The hypothetical L source fits a contemporary solution in which Mark was the first gospel and Q was a written source for both Matthew and Luke.

Some of these are more obviously structural than others - hence the term legal opportunity is sometimes preferred over legal opportunity structure.

Legal opportunity has been used as an [[independent variable]] to help to explain strategy choice by social movement organisations (SMOs) - e.g. why SMOS adopt litigation rather than protest or political lobbying as a strategy. Other variables or explanatory frameworks it is commonly found alongside include [[framing (social sciences)|framing]],&lt;ref name="VanhalaLisa"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vanhala | first = Lisa | title = Making rights a reality?: disability rights activists and legal mobilization | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781107000872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[resource mobilization]] and grievance.

: 
'''Limmu''' was an [[Assyria]]n [[eponym]]. At the beginning of the reign of an Assyrian king, the limmu, an appointed royal official, would preside over the New Year festival at the capital. Each year a new limmu would be chosen.  Although picked by lot, there was most likely a limited group, such as the men of the most prominent families or perhaps members of the city assembly.  The Assyrians used the name of the limmu for that year to designate the year on official documents. Lists of limmus have been found accounting for every year between 892 BC and 648 BC.

During the [[Assyria|Old Assyrian]] period, the king himself was never the ''limmum'', as it was called in their language.  In the [[Assyrian Empire|Middle Assyrian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian]] periods, however, the king could take this office.

'''Mathematics and architecture''' are related, since, [[mathematics and art|as with other arts]], [[architect]]s use [[mathematics]] for several reasons. Apart from the mathematics needed when engineering [[building]]s, architects use [[geometry]]: to define the spatial form of a building; from the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] of the sixth century BC onwards, to create forms considered harmonious, and thus to lay out buildings and their surroundings according to mathematical, [[aesthetic]] and sometimes religious principles; to decorate buildings with mathematical objects such as [[tessellation]]s; and to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise wind speeds around the bases of tall buildings.

In &lt;!--[[History of Science and Technology in China|Ancient China]], Needs section in article before we put this here--&gt;[[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Ancient Greece]], [[Architecture of India|India]], and the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic world]], buildings including [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], temples, mosques, palaces and [[mausoleum]]s were laid out with specific proportions for religious reasons. In Islamic architecture, [[Geometry|geometric]] shapes and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric tiling patterns]] are used to decorate buildings, both inside and outside. Some Hindu temples have a [[fractal]]-like structure where parts resemble the whole, conveying a message about the infinite in [[Hindu cosmology]]. In [[Chinese architecture]], the [[tulou]] of [[Fujian province]] are circular, communal defensive structures. In the twenty-first century, mathematical ornamentation is again being used to cover public buildings.

In [[Renaissance architecture]], [[symmetry]] and proportion were deliberately emphasized by architects such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Sebastiano Serlio]] and [[Andrea Palladio]], influenced by [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'' from [[Ancient Rome]] and the arithmetic of the Pythagoreans from Ancient Greece.
At the end of the nineteenth century, [[Vladimir Shukhov]] in [[Russia]] and [[Antoni Gaudí]] in [[Barcelona]] pioneered the use of [[hyperboloid structures]]; in the [[Sagrada Família]], Gaudí also incorporated [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] [[paraboloid]]s, tessellations, [[catenary arch]]es, [[catenoid]]s, [[helicoid]]s, and [[ruled surface]]s. In the twentieth century, styles such as [[modern architecture]] and [[Deconstructivism]] explored different geometries to achieve desired effects. [[Minimal surface]]s have been exploited in tent-like roof coverings as at [[Denver International Airport]], while [[Richard Buckminster Fuller]] pioneered the use of the strong [[thin-shell structure]]s known as [[geodesic dome]]s.

==Connected fields==
[[File:CdM, presunto autoritratto di leon battista alberti, white ground.jpg|thumb|upright|In the [[Renaissance]], an [[architect]] like [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was expected to be knowledgeable in many disciplines, including [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]].]]

The architects Michael Ostwald and Kim Williams, considering the relationships between [[architecture]] and [[mathematics]], note that the fields as commonly understood might seem to be only weakly connected, since architecture is a profession concerned with the practical matter of making buildings, while mathematics is the pure [[Number theory|study of number]] and other abstract objects. But, they argue, the two are strongly connected, and have been since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. In Ancient Rome, [[Vitruvius]] described an architect as a man who knew enough of a range of other disciplines, primarily [[geometry]], to enable him to oversee skilled artisans in all the other necessary areas, such as masons and carpenters. The same applied in the [[Middle Ages]], where graduates learnt [[arithmetic]], geometry and [[aesthetics]] alongside the basic syllabus of grammar, logic, and rhetoric (the [[trivium]]) in elegant halls made by master builders who had guided many craftsmen. A master builder at the top of his profession was given the title of architect or engineer. In the [[Renaissance]], the [[quadrivium]] of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy became an extra syllabus expected of the [[Renaissance man]] such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. Similarly in England, Sir [[Christopher Wren]], known today as an architect, was firstly a noted astronomer.&lt;ref name=Ostwald1&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Williams, Kim |editor2=Ostwald, Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume I: from Antiquity to the 1500s |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2015 |isbn=978-3-319-00136-4 |pages=chapter 1. 1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams and Ostwald, further overviewing the interaction of mathematics and architecture since 1500 according to the approach of the German sociologist [[Theodor W. Adorno|Theodor Adorno]], identify three tendencies among architects, namely: to be [[revolutionary]], introducing wholly new ideas; [[reactionary]], failing to introduce change; or [[revivalist artist|revivalist]], actually going backwards. They argue that architects have avoided looking to mathematics for inspiration in revivalist times. This would explain why in revivalist periods, such as the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in 19th century England, architecture had little connection to mathematics. Equally, they note that in reactionary times such as the Italian [[Mannerism]] of about 1520 to 1580, or the 17th century [[Baroque]] and [[Palladian]] movements, mathematics was barely consulted. In contrast, the revolutionary early 20th century movements such as [[Futurism]] and [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] actively rejected old ideas, embracing mathematics and leading to [[Modernist]] architecture. Towards the end of the 20th century, too, [[fractal]] geometry was quickly seized upon by architects, as was [[aperiodic tiling]], to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings.&lt;ref name=Ostwald48&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Williams, Kim |editor2=Ostwald, Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume II: The 1500s to the Future |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2015 |isbn=978-3-319-00142-5 |pages=chapter 48. 1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - Interior of the Pantheon, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The interior of the [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]] by [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]], 1758]]

The influential Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius argued that the design of a building such as a temple depends on two qualities, proportion and ''symmetria''. Proportion ensures that each part of a building relates harmoniously to every other part. ''Symmetria'' in Vitruvius's usage means something closer to the English term modularity than [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as again it relates to the assembling of (modular) parts into the whole building. In his Basilica at [[Fano]], he uses ratios of small integers, especially the [[triangular number]]s (1, 3, 6, 10,&amp;nbsp;...) to proportion the structure into [[Vitruvian module|(Vitruvian) modules]].{{efn|In Book 4, chapter 3 of ''[[De architectura]]'', he discusses modules directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vitruvius |title=VITRUVIUS, BOOK IV, CHAPTER 3 On the Doric order |url=http://www.vitruvius.be/boek4h3.htm|website=Vitruvius.be |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus the Basilica's width to length is 1:2; the aisle around it is as high as it is wide, 1:1; the columns are five feet thick and fifty feet high, 1:10.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Vitruvius |title=On Architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBLNbOp46CYC&amp;pg=PR9 |year=2009 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-193195-1 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dehio 1 Pantheon Floor plan.jpg|thumb|upright|Floor plan of the Pantheon]]

Vitruvius named three qualities required of architecture in his ''[[De architectura]]'', c. 15 B.C.: firmness, usefulness (or "Commodity" in [[Henry Wotton]]'s 16th century English), and delight. These can be used as categories for classifying the ways in which mathematics is used in architecture. Firmness encompasses the use of mathematics to ensure a building stands up, hence the mathematical tools used in design and to support construction, for instance to ensure stability and to model performance. Usefulness derives in part from the effective application of mathematics, reasoning about and analysing the spatial and other relationships in a design. Delight is an attribute of the resulting building, resulting from the embodying of mathematical relationships in the building; it includes aesthetic, sensual and intellectual qualities.&lt;ref name="WilliamsOstwald2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Kim |last2=Ostwald |first2=Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume I: Antiquity to the 1500s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWKYBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42 |date=9 February 2015 |publisher=Birkhäuser |isbn=978-3-319-00137-1 |pages=42, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]] in Rome has survived intact, illustrating classical Roman structure, proportion, and decoration. The main structure is a dome, the apex left open as a circular [[oculus]] to let in light; it is fronted by a short colonnade with a triangular pediment. The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, {{convert|43.3|m|ft}}, so the whole interior would fit exactly within a cube, and the interior could house a sphere of the same diameter.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{cite book | last=Roth | first=Leland M. | title=Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History, And Meaning | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder | year=1992 | isbn=0-06-438493-4 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dimensions make more sense when expressed in [[ancient Roman units of measurement]]: The dome spans 150 [[Roman foot|Roman feet]]{{efn|A [[Roman foot]] was about {{convert|0.296|m|ft}}.}}); the oculus is 30 Roman feet in diameter; the doorway is 40 Roman feet high.&lt;ref name=Claridge&gt;{{cite book | last=Claridge | first=Amanda | title=Rome | series= Oxford Archaeological Guides |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford Oxfordshire | year=1998| isbn=0-19-288003-9 |pages=204–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pantheon remains the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome.&lt;ref name=Lancaster&gt;{{cite book | last=Lancaster | first=Lynne C. | title=Concrete Vaulted Construction in Imperial Rome: Innovations in Context | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=2005 | isbn=0-521-84202-6 |pages=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{further information|Renaissance architecture}}
[[File:Santa Maria Novella.jpg|thumb|Facade of [[Santa Maria Novella]], [[Florence]], 1470. The frieze (with squares) and above is by [[Leon Battista Alberti]].]]

The first Renaissance treatise on architecture was Leon Battista Alberti's 1450 ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' (On the Art of Building); it became the first printed book on architecture in 1485. It was partly based on Vitruvius's ''De architectura'' and, via Nicomachus, Pythagorean arithmetic. Alberti starts with a cube, and derives ratios from it. Thus the diagonal of a face gives the ratio 1:{{radic|2}}, while the diameter of the sphere which circumscribes the cube gives 1:{{radic|3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=March |first1=Lionel |title=Renaissance mathematics and architectural proportion in Alberti's De re aedificatoria |journal=Architectural Research Quarterly |date=1996 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=54–65 |doi=10.1017/S135913550000110X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sphere circumscribing a cube |url=http://www.mathalino.com/reviewer/solid-mensuration-solid-geometry/013-insciribed-and-circumscribed-sphere-about-cube-volume- |website=Mathalino.com Engineering Math Review |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberti also documented [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s discovery of [[linear perspective]], developed to enable the design of buildings which would look beautifully proportioned when viewed from a convenient distance.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt;

The next major text was [[Sebastiano Serlio]]'s ''Regole generali d'architettura'' (General Rules of Architecture); the first volume appeared in Venice in 1537; the 1545 volume (books 1 and 2) covered geometry and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. Two of Serlio's methods for constructing perspectives were wrong, but this did not stop his work being widely used.&lt;ref name="Andersen2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Kirsti |title=The Geometry of an Art: The History of the Mathematical Theory of Perspective from Alberti to Monge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8B_JeMxNUIkC&amp;pg=PA120 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-48946-9 |pages=117–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Villa Pisani.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andrea Palladio]]'s plan and elevation of the [[Villa Pisani (Bagnolo)|Villa Pisani]]]]
In 1570, [[Andrea Palladio]] published the influential ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture) in [[Venice]]. This widely printed book was largely responsible for spreading the ideas of the Italian Renaissance throughout Europe, assisted by proponents like the English diplomat Henry Wotton with his 1624 ''The Elements of Architecture''.&lt;ref name=Ruhl&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ruhl |first1=Carsten |title=Palladianism: From the Italian Villa to International Architecture |url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/europe-on-the-road/educational-journey-grand-tour/carsten-ruhl-palladianism |publisher=European History Online |accessdate=3 October 2015 |date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Copplestone, Trewin |year=1963 |title=World Architecture |publisher=Hamlyn |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palladio permitted a range of ratios in the ''Quattro libri'', stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wassell |first1=Stephen R. |title=The Mathematics Of Palladio's Villas: Workshop '98 |url=http://www.emis.de/journals/NNJ/Wassell.html |publisher=Nexus Network Journal |accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Palladio, Andrea |title=I quattro libri dell'architettura |author2=Tavernor, Robert; Schofield, Richard (trans.) |publisher=MIT Press |year=1997 |origyear=1570 |page=book I, chapter xxi, page 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[fractals]] has been used to show that the reason why existing buildings have universal appeal and are visually satisfying is because they provide the viewer with a sense of scale at different viewing distances. For example, in the tall [[gopuram]] gatehouses of [[Hindu]] temples such as the [[Virupaksha Temple, Hampi|Virupaksha Temple]] at [[Hampi]] built in the seventh century, and others such as the [[Kandariya Mahadev Temple]] at [[Khajuraho]], the parts and the whole have the same character, with [[fractal dimension]] in the range 1.7 to 1.8. The cluster of smaller towers (''shikhara'', lit. 'mountain') about the tallest, central, tower which represents the holy [[Mount Kailash]], abode of Lord [[Shiva]], depicts the endless repetition of universes in [[Hindu cosmology]].&lt;ref name=Rian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;{{cite web |title=Fractals in Indian Architecture |url=https://classes.yale.edu/fractals/Panorama/Architecture/IndianArch/IndianArch.html |publisher=Yale University |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious studies scholar William J.

The [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] is a large complex with multiple shrines, with the streets of [[Madurai]] laid out concentrically around it according to the shastras.

===Ancient Greece===
{{further information|Greek architecture|golden ratio|Pythagoreanism|Euclidean geometry}}
[[File:The Parthenon Athens.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] was designed using [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] ratios.]]

[[Pythagoras]] (c. 569 – c. 475 B.C.) and his followers, the Pythagoreans, held that "all things are numbers". They observed the harmonies produced by notes with specific small-integer ratios of frequency, and argued that buildings too should be designed with such ratios. The Greek word ''symmetria'' originally denoted the harmony of architectural shapes in precise ratios from a building's smallest details right up to its entire design.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=J.

[[File:Parthenon-top-view.svg|thumb|upright|Floor plan of the Parthenon]]
The [[Parthenon]] is {{convert|69.5|m|ft}} long, {{convert|30.9|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|13.7|m|ft}} high to the cornice. This gives a ratio of width to length of 4:9, and the same for height to width. Putting these together gives height:width:length of 16:36:81, or to the delight&lt;ref name="Maor2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maor|first=Eli|title=The Pythagorean Theorem: A 4,000-year History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5VoBGy3AoAC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12526-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Pythagoreans 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This sets the module as 0.858&amp;nbsp;m. A 4:9 rectangle can be constructed as three contiguous rectangles with sides in the ratio 3:4. Each half-rectangle is then a convenient 3:4:5 right triangle, enabling the angles and sides to be checked with a suitably knotted rope. The inner area (naos) similarly has 4:9 proportions ({{convert|21.44|m|ft}} wide by 48.3&amp;nbsp;m long); the ratio between the diameter of the outer columns, {{convert|1.905|m|ft}}, and the spacing of their centres, {{convert|4.293|m|ft}}, is also 4:9.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt;

The Parthenon is considered by authors such as [[John Julius Norwich]] "the most perfect Doric temple ever built".&lt;ref name=Norwich/&gt; Its elaborate architectural refinements include "a subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [[naos (architecture)|naos]] walls and the ''entasis'' of the columns".&lt;ref name=Norwich&gt;{{cite book |author=Norwich, John Julius |title=Great Architecture of the World |publisher=Artists House |year=2001 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entasis]]'' refers to the subtle diminution in diameter of the columns as they rise. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in other classical Greek temples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Penrose, Francis |title=Principles of Athenian Architecture |publisher=Society of Dilettanti |year=1973 |origyear=1851 |page=ch. II.3, plate 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the platform has a slight parabolic upward curvature to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outwards, but they actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on, they would meet about a mile above the centre of the building; since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [[architrave]] and roof above: "all follow the rule of being built to delicate curves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stevens, Gorham P. |title=Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |volume=66 |issue=3 |date=July 1962 |pages=337–338 |doi=10.2307/501468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The golden ratio was known in 300 B.C., when [[Euclid]] described the method of geometric construction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Euclid's Elements|Euclid. ''Elements'']]. Book 6, Proposition 30.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the golden ratio was used in the design of the Parthenon and other ancient Greek buildings, as well as sculptures, paintings, and vases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Archibald, R.

The [[Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]], Turkey, was built by [[Mimar Sinan]] to provide a space where the [[mihrab]] could be see from anywhere inside the building. The very large central space is accordingly arranged as an octagon, formed by 8 enormous pillars, and capped by a circular dome of {{convert|31.25|m|ft}} diameter and {{convert|43|m|ft}} high. The octagon is formed into a square with four semidomes, and externally by four exceptionally tall minarets, {{convert|83|m|ft}} tall.

The buildings include a [[mosque]] in red sandstone on the west, and an almost identical building, the Jawab or 'answer' on the east to maintain the bilateral symmetry of the complex. The formal [[charbagh]] ('fourfold garden') is in four parts, symbolising the four rivers of paradise, and offering views and reflections of the mausoleum.

The mausoleum, mosque and guest house are laid out on a grid of 7 gaz. Koch and Barraud observe that if an octagon, used repeatedly in the complex, is given sides of 7 units, then it has a width of 17 units,{{efn|A square drawn around the octagon by prolonging alternate sides adds four right angle triangles with hypotenuse of 7 and the other two sides of {{radic|49/2}} or 4.9497..., nearly 5.

The church further has five gates, five chapels, five altars and five stars; a legend claims that when [[Saint John of Nepomuk]] was martyred, five stars appeared over his head.&lt;ref name="SimitchWarke2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zelená hora near Žďár nad Sázavou |url=http://www.czechtourism.com/c/zdar-nad-sazavou-unesco-zelena-hora-pilgrimage-church-of-st-john-nepomuk/ |publisher=Czech Tourism |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fivefold architecture may also symbolise the [[five wounds of Christ]] and the five letters of "Tacui" (Latin: "I kept silence" [about secrets of the [[confessional]]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Attributes of Saint John of Nepomuk |url=http://www.sjn.cz/eng/attributes.htm |website=Saint John of Nepomuk |accessdate=10 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064831/http://www.sjn.cz/eng/attributes.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antoni Gaudí]] used a wide variety of geometric structures, some being minimal surfaces, in the [[Sagrada Família]], [[Barcelona]], started in 1882 (and not completed as of 2015). These include hyperbolic [[paraboloid]]s and [[hyperboloid|hyperboloids of revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Drawing Together Euclidean and Topological Threads (pdf) | last=Burry | first=M.C., J.R.

This varied mix of geometries is creatively combined in different ways around the church. For example, in the Passion Façade of Sagrada Família, Gaudí assembled stone "branches" in the form of hyperbolic paraboloids, which overlap at their tops (directrices) without, therefore, meeting at a point. In contrast, in the colonnade there are hyperbolic paraboloidal surfaces that smoothly join other structures to form unbounded surfaces. Further, Gaudí exploits [[patterns in nature|natural patterns]], themselves mathematical, with [[column]]s derived from the shapes of [[tree]]s, and [[lintel]]s made from unmodified [[basalt]] naturally cracked (by cooling from molten rock) into [[List of places with columnar jointed volcanics|hexagonal columns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Geometry of Antoni Gaudi |url=http://euler.slu.edu/escher/index.php/The_Geometry_of_Antoni_Gaudi |website=Math &amp; the Art of MC Escher |publisher=Saint Louis University Mathematics and Computer Science |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Usvat |first1=Liliana |title=Antony Gaudi and Mathematics |url=http://www.mathematicsmagazine.com/Articles/AntonyGaudiandMathematics.php#.VhFZ7WtUWHg |publisher=Mathematics Magazine |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burry&gt;{{cite journal |author=M.C.

Several medieval [[Nordic round churches|churches in Scandinavia are circular]], including four on the Danish island of [[Bornholm]]. One of the oldest of these, [[Østerlars Church]] from c. 1160, has a circular nave around a massive circular stone column, pierced with arches and decorated with a fresco. The circular structure has three storeys and was apparently fortified, the top storey having served for defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nordenskirker.dk/Tidligere/oesterlars_kirke/oesterlars_kirke.htm |title=Østerlars kirke |publisher=Nordens kirker |language=Danish |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical decoration==

===Islamic architectural decoration===
{{main article|Islamic geometric patterns}}

Islamic buildings are often decorated with [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] which typically make use of several mathematical [[tessellations]], formed of ceramic tiles ([[girih]], [[zellige]]) that may themselves be plain or decorated with stripes.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt; Symmetries such as stars with six, eight, or multiples of eight points are used in Islamic patterns. Some of these are based on the 'Khatem Sulemani' or Solomon's seal motif, which is an eight-pointed star made of two squares, one rotated 45 degrees from the other on the same centre.&lt;ref name=Ronning&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.exeter.ac.uk/PErnest/pome24/ronning%20_geometry_and_Islamic_patterns.pdf | title=Islamic Patterns And Symmetry Groups | publisher=University of Exeter | accessdate=18 April 2014 | author=Rønning, Frode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic patterns exploit many of the 17 possible [[wallpaper groups]]; as early as 1944, Edith Müller showed that the Alhambra made use of 11 wallpaper groups in its decorations, while in 1986 [[Branko Grünbaum]] claimed to have found 13 wallpaper groups in the Alhambra, asserting controversially that the remaining 4 groups are not found anywhere in Islamic ornament.&lt;ref name=Ronning/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Modern architectural decoration===
{{further information|Ornament (art)|Contemporary architecture}}

Towards the end of the 20th century, novel mathematical constructs such as fractal geometry and aperiodic tiling were seized upon by architects to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings.&lt;ref name=Ostwald48/&gt; In 1913, the Modernist architect [[Adolf Loos]] had declared that "Ornament is a crime",&lt;ref name=Gibberd&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gibberd |first1=Matt |last2=Hill |first2=Albert |title=The Return of Ornamentation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/property-and-architecture/7279/the-return-of-ornamentation.html |accessdate=12 October 2015 |work=The Telegraph |date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; influencing architectural thinking for the rest of the 20th century. In the 21st century, architects are again starting to explore the use of [[Ornament (art)|ornament]]. 21st century ornamentation is extremely diverse. Henning Larsen's 2011 [[Harpa Concert and Conference Centre]], Reykjavik has what looks like a crystal wall of rock made of large blocks of glass.&lt;ref name=Gibberd/&gt; Foreign Office Architects' 2010 [[Ravensbourne College]], London is tessellated decoratively with 28,000 anodised aluminium tiles in red, white and brown, interlinking circular windows of differing sizes. The tessellation uses three types of tile, an equilateral triangle and two irregular pentagons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ravensbourne College by Foreign Office Architects|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2010/09/13/ravensbourne-college-by-foreign-office-architects/|publisher=de zeen magazine|accessdate=12 October 2015|date=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bizley/&gt;{{efn|An aperiodic tiling was considered, to avoid the rhythm of a structural grid, but in practice a Penrose tiling was too complex, so a grid of 2.625m horizontally and 4.55m vertically was chosen.&lt;ref name=Bizley&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bizley |first1=Graham |title=FOA's peninsula patterns for Ravensbourne College |url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/foa%E2%80%99s-peninsula-patterns-for-ravensbourne-college/3144928.article |website=bdonline.co.uk |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Kazumi Kudo's [[Kanazawa Umimirai Library]] creates a decorative grid made of small circular blocks of glass set into plain concrete walls.&lt;ref name=Gibberd/&gt;

==Defence==

===Europe===
{{further information|Star fort}}

The architecture of [[fortification]]s evolved from [[medieval fortification|medieval fortresses]], which had high masonry walls, to low, symmetrical [[star fort]]s able to resist [[artillery]] bombardment between the mid-fifteenth and nineteenth centuries. The geometry of the star shapes was dictated by the need to avoid dead zones where attacking infantry could shelter from defensive fire; the sides of the projecting points were angled to permit such fire to sweep the ground, and to provide crossfire (from both sides) beyond each projecting point. Well-known architects who designed such defences include [[Michelangelo]], [[Baldassare Peruzzi]], [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] and [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Duffy, C. |year=1975 |title=Fire &amp; Stone, The Science of Fortress Warfare 1660–1860 |publisher=Booksales |isbn=978-0-7858-2109-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler |first1=David |title=The Art of Warfare in the Age of Marlborough |date=1990 |publisher=Spellmount |isbn=978-0-946771-42-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural historian [[Siegfried Giedion]] argued that the star-shaped fortification had a formative influence on the patterning of the Renaissance [[Urban planning|ideal city]]: "The Renaissance was hypnotized by one city type which for a century and a half—from Filarete to Scamozzi—was impressed upon all utopian schemes: this is the star-shaped city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Giedion, Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Giedion |title=Space, Time and Architecture |publisher=Harvard University Press |origyear=1941 |date=1962 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===China===
[[File:HakkaYongding.jpg|thumb|A [[tulou]] in [[Yongding County]], [[Fujian province]]]]

In [[Chinese architecture]], the [[tulou]] of [[Fujian province]] are circular, communal defensive structures with mainly blank walls and a single iron-plated wooden door, some dating back to the sixteenth century. The walls are topped with roofs that slope gently both outwards and inwards, forming a ring. The centre of the circle is an open cobbled courtyard, often with a well, surrounded by timbered galleries up to five stories high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Neill |first1=Tom |title=China's Remote Fortresses Lose Residents, Gain Tourists |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/01/150102-hakka-china-tulou-fujian-world-heritage-culture-housing/ |publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |accessdate=6 January 2017 |date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental goals==
[[File:Yakhchal of Yazd province.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yakhchal]] in [[Yazd]], Iran]]

Architects may also select the form of a building to meet environmental goals.&lt;ref name="SimitchWarke2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simitch |first1=Andrea |last2=Warke |first2=Val |title=The Language of Architecture: 26 Principles Every Architect Should Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2v-1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT191 |year=2014 |publisher=Rockport Publishers |isbn=978-1-62788-048-0 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Foster and Partners]]' [[30 St Mary Axe]], London, known as "[[#Top|The Gherkin]]"&lt;!--links to top (lead image)--&gt; for its [[cucumber]]-like shape, is a [[solid of revolution]] designed using [[Computer aided design|parametric modelling]]. Its geometry was chosen not purely for aesthetic reasons, but to minimise whirling air currents at its base. Despite the building's apparently curved surface, all the panels of glass forming its skin are flat, except for the lens at the top. Most of the panels are [[quadrilateral]]s, as they can be cut from rectangular glass with less wastage than triangular panels.&lt;ref name=Freiberger&gt;{{cite web |last1=Freiberger |first1=Marianne |title=Perfect buildings: the maths of modern architecture |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/perfect-buildings-maths-modern-architecture|publisher=Plus magazine|accessdate=5 October 2015|date=1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[yakhchal]] (ice pit) of [[Iran|Persia]] functioned as an [[evaporative cooler]]. Above ground, the structure had a domed shape, but had a subterranean storage space for ice and sometimes food as well. The subterranean space and the thick heat-resistant construction insulated the storage space year round. The internal space was often further cooled with [[windcatcher]]s. The ice was available in the summer to make the frozen dessert [[faloodeh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mahdavinejad |first=M. |author2=Javanrudi, Kavan |title=Assessment of Ancient Fridges: A Sustainable Method to Storage Ice in Hot-Arid Climates |journal=Asian Culture and History |date=July 2012 |volume=4 |issue=2 |doi=10.5539/ach.v4n2p133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media art history''' is an interdisciplinary field of research that explores the current developments as well as the history and genealogy of [[new media art]], [[digital art]], and [[electronic art]].&lt;ref&gt;Cubitt, Sean and Paul Thomas. eds. 2013. Relive: Media Art Histories. Cambridge/Mass.: MIT-Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grau, Oliver. ed. 2007. MediaArtHistories. Cambridge: MIT-Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frieling, Rudolf and Dieter Daniels. eds. 2004. Media Art Net 1: Survey of Media Art. New York/Vienna: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, media art histories addresses the contemporary interplay of art, technology, and science.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Stephen. 2002. Information Arts. Intersections of Art, Science, and Technology Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Stephen. 2010. Art + Science Now. London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Linda. 1983. The Fourth Dimension and Non - Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art . Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other, it aims to reveal the historical relationships and aspects of the ‘afterlife’ ([[Aby Warburg]]) in new media art by means of a historical comparative approach. This strand of research encompasses questions of the history of media and perception, of so-called archetypes,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Grau, Oliver. 2003. Virtual Art: From Illusion to Immersion. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those of [[iconography]] and the [[history of ideas]]. Moreover, one of the main agendas of media art histories is to point out the role of digital technologies for contemporary, post-industrial societies and to counteract the marginalization of according art practices and art objects: ″Digital technology has fundamentally changed the way art is made. Over the last forty years, media art has become a significant part of our networked information society. Although there are well-attended international festivals, collaborative research projects, exhibitions and database documentation resources, media art research is still marginal in universities, museums and archives. It remains largely under-resourced in our core cultural institutions.″&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediaarthistory.org/declaration&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[new media art]] itself is of great importance to the field.&lt;ref&gt;Rush, Michael. 2005. New Media in Art. London: Thames &amp; Hudson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tribe, Mark, Reena Jana and Uta Grosenick. 2006. New Media Art. Köln: Taschen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shanken, Edward A. 2009. Art and Electronic Media. London: Phaidon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Christiane. 2003. Digital Art. New York: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; New media art is an umbrella term that encompasses art forms that are produced, modified and transmitted by means of [[Digital technology|digital technologies]] or, in a broader sense, make use of ‘new’ and emerging technologies that originate from a scientific, military or industrial context. The majority of authors that try to ‘delineate’ the aesthetic object of new media art emphasize aspects of [[interactivity]], processuality, [[multimedia]], and [[real time (media)|real time]]. The focus of new media art lies in the cultural, political, and social implications as well as the aesthetic possibilities – more or less its ‘media-specificity’ – of digital media. Consequently, scholars recognize the function of media technologies in New Media Art not only as a ‘carrier’ of meaning, but instead as a means that fundamentally shapes the very meaning of the artwork itself.

Furthermore, the field of new media art is increasingly influenced by new technologies that surmount a traditional understanding of (art) media. This becomes apparent in regards to technologies that originate from the field of biotechnology and life science and that are employed in artistic practices such as bio art, genetic art, and transgenic art. Consequently, the term new media art does not imply a steady ‘genre’ of art production. Instead, it is a field that emphasizes new technologies (in order to establish an explicit difference with traditional art media and genres). The list of genres that are commonly subsumed under the label of new media art illustrates its broad scope and includes, among others, virtual art.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Frank. 2007.

== Resources and research projects ==

Since the end of the 1990s, the first online databases came into being, as exemplified by the university-based Archive of Digital Art,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalartarchive.at/nc/home.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rhizome&lt;ref&gt;http://rhizome.org/&lt;/ref&gt; platform located in New York, Netzspannung&lt;ref&gt;http://netzspannung.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (until 2005), the database project Compart&lt;ref&gt;http://dada.compart-bremen.de/&lt;/ref&gt; in which early phase of Digital Art is addressed, and the collaborative online platform Monoskop.&lt;ref&gt;http://monoskop.org/Monoskop&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of institutional resources, media art histories spans diverse organisations, archives, research centres as well as private initiatives. Already at this early stage in the development of the field, the actors of media art histories were connected by way of digital communication, especially by so-called mailing lists such as [[Nettime]] or Rohrpost, both channels of communication that remain prime resources for the new media art community.

In the last few years, there was a significant increase of festivals and conferences dedicated to new media art, though the dominant festivals in the field continue to be the [[Ars Electronica]], the [[Transmediale]], the [[Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts|ISEA]] (Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts), and [[SIGGRAPH]] (Special Interest Group on Graphics and Interactive Techniques). To this day, museums and research facilities specializing in New Media Art are the exception. Nevertheless, [[ZKM]] (Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie) or specific focuses in collections (including the [[Whitney Museum]], the [[New York Museum of Modern Art]], or the [[Walker Art Center]]) serve as important spaces for exchange. Beyond museums that reach a wider audience, there are more and more smaller museums and galleries that focus on new media art (such as the Berlin-based DAM – Digital Art Museum).  Additionally, archives in which are exhibited artifacts situated at the intersection of the histories of media, art, and technology are important resources, including collections such as that of Werner Nekes or those cabinets of wonder and curiosity incorporated in art history museums.

Even given this increase in festivals, however, a variety of significant research initiatives have been discontinued.  These include the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Media.Art.Research, the Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science and Technology,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/&lt;/ref&gt; and Media Art Net.  This difficulty in establishing sustainable funding structures as well as support for access to shared data for the scientific research of new media art was made public and addressed by the [http://www.mediaarthistory.org/declaration Liverpool Declaration]. Scholars and artists based at institutions all over the globe signed the declaration in a call to develop systematic strategies to fulfill the task that digital culture and its research demands in the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;Signatories are, among others, Sean CUBITT, Goldsmith; Oliver GRAU, Danube U; Ross HARLEY, UNSW Sydney;  Christiane PAUL, New School, New York; Diana DOMINGUES, Universidade de Brasília; Horst BREDEKAMP, Humboldt-University Berlin; Barbara Maria STAFFORD, Georgia Tech; Frieder NAKE, University of Bremen; Peter WEIBEL, ZKM; Roy ASCOTT, University of Plymouth, Sir Nicholas SEROTA, Tate; Martin WARNKE, Leuphana University, Mike STUBBS, FACT Liverpool; Benjamin WEIL, LABORAL; Andreas BROECKMANN, Leuphana Arts Program; Jeffrey SHAW, City University Hong Kong; Eduardo KAC, Chicago Arts Institute; Christa SOMMERER, University of Art Linz; Alex ADRIAANSENS, Institute for the Unstable Media, Lanfranco ACETI, Sabanci U; Howard BESSER, NYU’s  Tisch School of the Arts, Ianina PRUDENKO, National Univ.

Already in the late 1990s it became clear, that media art research is spread over many disciplines and the need became urgent to give it common ground: Therefore, at Humboldt University Berlin Oliver Grau in Cooperation with Roger Malina, Leonardo and Sara Diamond, Banff Center developed the international Conference Series on the Histories of MediaArt, Science and Technology, which was started in 2005 through a collective process, involving more than 10 disciplines related to media art. The world conference series attempts to foster the exchange between these different disciplines and their various actors. To date, the conference took place six times with Re-fresh (Banff 2005), Re-place (Berlin 2007), Re-live (Melbourne 2009), Re-wire (Liverpool 2011), Re-new (Riga 2013), Re-create (Montreal 2015), upcoming Vienna/Krems ad Donau (2017). Documentation of the meanwhile more than 2000 papers and applications can be found on MediaArtHistory.org [http://www.mediaarthistory.org/]

== Focus of research ==

Several scholars in the field of media art history claim that there is still a considerable lack of knowledge regarding the origins of visual and audio-visual media.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Grau, Oliver. Introduction. In MediaArtHistories, edited by Oliver Grau, 1-14. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it is the objective of media art histories to expand the historically informed knowledge of current media cultures with its developments and detours – the field is driven by the idea of a ‘deep time of the media’ (S. Zielinski).

Hence, scholars stress that the technological advances in current media cultures are best understood on the backdrop of an extensive media and art history. Contributions to this field are widespread and include, among others, researchers who have disciplinary focuses such as the history of science ([[Lorraine Daston]], Timothy Lenoir), art history and image science ([[Oliver Grau]], [[Barbara Stafford]], Dieter Daniels, Slavko Kacunko, [[Edward A. Shanken]], Gunalan Nadarajan, Linda Henderson, Andreas Broeckmann, [[Jonathan Crary]], [[Horst Bredekamp]], [[Peter Weibel]], [[Hans Belting]]), [[media studies]] and [[media archaeology]] ([[Friedrich Kittler]], [[Erkki Huhtamo]], [[Jussi Parikka]], [[ Wolfgang Ernst (media theorist)|Wolfgang Ernst]], [[Siegfried Zielinski]], Stephan Oettermann, [[Lev Manovich]]), [[sound studies]] ([[Douglas Kahn]]), [[film studies]] (Sean Cubitt, Ryszard Kluszczyński), as well as [[computer science]] ([[Frieder Nake]]).

{{Ancient Near East topics}}
The '''middle chronology''' is one [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|chronology of the Near Eastern Bronze and Early Iron Age]], which fixes the reign of [[Hammurabi]] to 1792–1750 BCE and the [[Babylonia#The sack of Babylon and ancient Near East chronology|sack of Babylon]] to 1595 BCE.&lt;ref name="Bernal1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Bernal|title=Black Athena|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hs0p20bLNVsC&amp;pg=PA215|accessdate=3 November 2012|date=1 June 1991|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-1584-7|pages=215–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chronology is based on a 56/64-year [[astronomical]] calculation determined by evidence from the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]] and
the [[Enuma anu enlil]] tablet 63. Conventional textbooks tend to use the middle chronology, but early [[dendrochronological]] and [[astronomical]] evidence presented various problems for it.&lt;ref name="McIntosh2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane McIntosh|title=Ancient Mesopotamia: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9veK7E2JwkUC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=3 November 2012|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-965-2|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to increased adoption of the short chronologies by some.&lt;ref name="Gurzadyan"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0311035.pdf Gurzadyan, V. G., On the Astronomical Records and Babylonian Chronology, ICRA, University of Rome “La Sapienza”, Italy and Yerevan Physics Institute, Armenia, Akkadica, v. 119–120 (2000), pp. 175–184.)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ultra1"&gt;Warburton, D.A., The Fall of Babylon in 1499: Another Update, Akkadica, v. 132, 1 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent studies have shown that the Middle Chronology is most likely.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/07/cornell-led-research-resolves-long-debated-mesopotamia-timeline&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem raised by using short chronologies is that a century or more needs to be added to some period of the second millennium BCE to accommodate it, but no one so far has been able to make a suggestion as to which period to add it to. That has left second millennium BCE dates appearing artificially short and has resulted in distortion and loss of accuracy for older dates, as a sacrifice to provide greater accuracy for earlier ones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1619055/Problems_of_Chronology_Mesopotamia_Anatolia_and_the_Syro-Levantine_Region], Schwartz, Glenn, 2008.  "Problems of Chronology: Mesopotamia, Anatolia, and the Syro-Levantine Region." In: Beyond Babylon: Art, Trade, and Diplomacy in the Second Millennium B.C., edited by Joan Aruz, Kim Benzel, and Jean M. Evans: 450–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scholars have favoured different chronologies in recent years. [[Peter J. Huber]] has favoured the [[long chronology]], relying on [[astronomical]] data available from [[Enuma anu enlil]] tablets 20 and 21 linking lunar [[eclipse]]s to historical events in the [[Ur III]] period, along with the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]], Old Babylonian month lengths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caeno.org/_Eponym/pdf/Huber_Ammizaduga_%20Gurzadyan%20rejoinder%202000_NEEDS%20FIX.pdf Huber, Peter J., Astronomy and Ancient Chronology, Akkadica 119–120 (2000), pp. 159–176.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous elements of Huber's theories have been criticized by a consortium of scholars led by [[Hermann Gasche]] and [[Vahe Gurzadyan]], who have suggested an [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|ultra-low chronology]] based on [[archaeological]] evidence and especially on more complete use of [[astronomical]] evidence. Gasche and Gurzadyan argue that only the eight-year cycle from the Venus tablet is entirely reliable and of practical use&lt;ref name="Gurzadyan"/&gt; (see update in&lt;ref name="ultra1" /&gt;). The latest studies largely rely on more evidences.&lt;ref name="ultra1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sassmannshausen, Leonhard. Zur mesopotamischen Chronologie des 2. Jahrtausends, Baghdader Mitteilungen 37, 157–177, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A study from 2001 published high-resolution radiocarbon dates from Turkey supporting dates for the 2nd millennium BC that are very close to those proposed by the middle chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=S.W.|last2=Kromer|first2=B.|last3=Kuniholm|first3=P.I.|last4=Newton|first4=M.W.|year=2001|title=Anatolian Tree Rings and a New Chronology for the East Mediterranean Bronze-Iron Ages|journal=Science|volume=294|pages=2532–2535|doi=10.1126/science.1066112|issue=5551|pmid=11743159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further support for the Middle Chronology (or a "Low-Middle" eight years lower) was provided by a 2016 study combining dendrochronology and radiocarbon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0157144#pone-0157144-g008 Sturt W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12880">'''Musical hallucinations'''  fall under the category of [[auditory hallucinations]] and describe a disorder in which a sound is perceived as instrumental music, sounds, or songs. It is a very rare disorder, reporting only 0.16% in a cohort study of 3,678 individuals.&lt;ref name ="Evers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Evers |first=S |author2=Ellger, T |title=The clinical spectrum of musical hallucinations |journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences |year=2004 |volume=227 |issue=1 |pages=55–65 |pmid=15546592 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2004.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of disorder ==
In 73 individual cases reviewed by Evers and Ellger, 57 patients heard tunes that were familiar, while 5 heard unfamiliar tunes. These tunes ranged from religious pieces to childhood favorites, and also included popular songs from the radio. Vocal and instrumental forms of classical music were also identified in some patients. Keshavan found that the consistent feature of musical hallucinations was that it represented a personal memory trace. Memory traces refer to anything that may seem familiar to the patient, which indicate why certain childhood or familiar songs were heard.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Keshavan" /&gt;

== Causes ==
Investigators have successfully narrowed down the major factors that are associated with musical hallucinations. Evers and Ellgers compiled a significant portion of musical hallucination articles, case studies etc. and were able to categorize five major etiologies:

* [[Hypoacusis]]
* [[Musical hallucinations#Psychiatric disorders|Psychiatric disorders]]
* [[Focal brain lesion]]
* [[Epilepsy]]
* [[Substance intoxication|Intoxication]]

=== Hypoacusis ===
Hypoacusis is defined as impairment in hearing or deafness. Hypoacusis is one of five etiologies of musical hallucinations, and is the most common in the case studies reviewed by Evers and Ellgers.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt; According to Sanchez et al. 2011, there have been suggestions that pontine lesions could alter the central auditory system's function causing hypoacusis and musical hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Hammeke"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hammeke |first=TA |author2=McQuillen, MP |author3=Cohen, BA  |title=Musical hallucinations associated with acquired deafness |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |year=1983 |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=570–2 |pmid=6875592 |pmc=1027453 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.46.6.570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanchez"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sanchez |first=TG|author2=Rocha, SC |author3=Knobel, KA |author4=Kii, MA |author5=Santos, RM |author6= Pereira, CB  |title=Musical hallucination associated with hearing loss |journal=Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria |year=2011 |volume=69 |issue=2B |pages=395–400 |pmid=21625772 |doi=10.1590/s0004-282x2011000300024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychiatric disorders ===
A case study by Janakiraman et al. 2006, revealed a 93‑year‑old woman with [[major depressive disorder]] who experienced musical hallucinations while treated with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT). Investigators found that the patient's depression symptoms were inversely related to her hallucinations and primarily stemmed from the ECT treatment.  The patient had no known abnormalities in hearing, suggesting that musical hallucinations could arise from a variety of sources including psychiatric illnesses. After a complete course of ECT, her hallucinations dissipated, also suggesting that they can be acute.&lt;ref name="Janaki"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Janakiraman |first=R |author2=Wildgoose, K |author3=Seelam, K  |title=ECT associated musical hallucinations in an elderly patient: a case report |journal=Annals of General Psychiatry |year=2006 |volume=5 |pages=10 |pmid=16889667 |doi=10.1186/1744-859X-5-10 |pmc=1557851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Evers and Ellgers, some other major psychiatric disorders that contribute to musical hallucinations include [[schizophrenia]] and depression. Some patients who have schizophrenia experience musical hallucinations due to their ongoing psychosis, but there are some cases that do so without psychosis. There are also a very small percentage of musical hallucination cases due to [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD).&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt;

=== Focal brain lesions ===
Among the handful of cases that Evers and Ellgers studied, major lesion sites included the temporal cortex; however, the specific location and laterality (left vs. right temporal cortex) was variable. Many cases of focal brain lesions had comorbidity with hearing impairment (see hypoacusis), epileptic activity and intoxication.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt; There have also been several findings of acute musical hallucinations in patients with dorsal [[pons]] lesions post-stroke and [[encephalitis]] potentially due to disruption of connections between the [[sensory cortex]] and [[reticular formation]].&lt;ref name="Schielke"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schielke |first=E |author2=Reuter, U |author3=Hoffmann, O |author4= Weber, JR  |title=Musical hallucinations with dorsal pontine lesions |journal=Neurology |year=2000 |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=454–5 |pmid=10932294 |doi=10.1212/wnl.55.3.454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epilepsy ===
Epileptic brain activity in musical hallucinations originates in the left or right temporal lobe.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt; In a specific case studied by Williams et al. 2008, a patient who received a left temporal lobectomy in order to treat epilepsy was diagnosed with musical hallucinations post-surgery. The patient also had multiple additional risk factors that could have accounted for the hallucinations including mild neuropsychiatric dysfunction and [[tinnitus]].&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=VG |author2=Tremont, G |author3=Blum, AS  |title=Musical hallucinations after left temporal lobectomy |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology |year=2008 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=38–40 |pmid=18327022 |doi=10.1097/WNN.0b013e318165a9e1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intoxication ===
Intoxication accounts for a small percentage of musical hallucination cases. Intoxication leads to either withdrawal or inflammatory encephalopathy, which are major contributors to musical hallucinations. Some of the drugs that have been found to relate to musical hallucinations include salicylates, benzodiazepines, pentoxifylline, propranolol, clomipramine, amphetamine, quinine, imipramine, a phenothiazine, carbamazepine, marijuana, paracetamol, phenytoin, procaine, and alcohol.  General anesthesia has also been association with musical hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt;
In a case study by Gondim et al. 2010, a seventy–seven-year-old woman with [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) was administered [[amantadine]] after a year of various other antiparkinsonian treatments. Two days into her treatment, she started to experience musical hallucinations, which consisted of four musical pieces. The music persisted until three days after cessation of the drug. Although the patient was taking other medications at the same time, the timing of onset and offset suggested that amantadine either had a synergistic effect with the other drugs or simply caused the hallucinations. Although the case wasn't specific to intoxication, it leads to the idea that persons with PD who are treated with certain drugs can experience musical hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Gondim"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gondim |first1=Francisco de Assis Aquino |last2=Costa |first2=Helida A. |last3=Taunay |first3=Tauily C.D. |last4=de Oliveira |first4=Gisele R. |last5=Ferreira |first5=Jamile Magalhães |last6=Rola |first6=Francisco H. |title=Transient amantadine‑induced musical hallucinations in a patient with Parkinson’s disease |journal=Movement Disorders |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2010 |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1505–1506 |pmid=20629118 |doi=10.1002/mds.22553 |issn=0885-3185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imaging ==
[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) show that musical hallucinations activate a wide variety of areas in the brain including the following: auditory areas, [[motor cortex]], visual areas, [[basal ganglia]], [[brainstem]], [[pons]], [[tegmentum]], [[cerebellum]], [[Hippocampus|hippocampi]], [[amygdala]], and peripheral auditory system.&lt;ref name="Sacks" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
To date, there is no successful method of treatment that "cures" musical hallucinations. There have been successful therapies in single cases that have ameliorated the hallucinations. Some of these successes include drugs such as neuroleptics, antidepressants, and certain anticonvulsive drugs. A musical hallucination was alleviated, for example, by antidepressant medications given to patients with depression.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt; Sanchez reported that some authors have suggested that the use of hearing aids may improve musical hallucination symptoms.&lt;ref name="Sanchez" /&gt; They believed that the external environment influences the auditory hallucinations, showing worsening of symptoms in quieter environments than in noisier ones.&lt;ref name="Hammeke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=TC |author2=Crosby, TW |title=Musical hallucinations in a deaf elderly patient |journal=Annals of Neurology |date=Mar 1979 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=301–2 |pmid=443762 |doi=10.1002/ana.410050314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Elliott D. |title=Musical Hallucinations in Deafness |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |date=1975-02-10 |volume=231 |issue=6 |pages=620 |doi=10.1001/jama.1975.03240180056018 |pmid=1172847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Sacks' patient, Mrs. O'C, reported being in an "ocean of sound" despite being in a quiet room due to a small thrombosis or infarction in her right temporal lobe. After treatment, Mrs. O'C was relinquished of her musical experience but said that, "I do miss the old songs. Now, with lots of them, I can't even recall them. It was like being given back a forgotten bit of my childhood again." Sacks also reported another elderly woman, Mrs. O'M, who had a mild case of deafness and reported hearing musical pieces. When she was treated with anticonvulsive medications, her musical hallucinations ceased but when asked if she missed them, she said "Not on your life."&lt;ref name="Sacks1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sacks |first=Oliver |title=The man who mistook his wife for a hat and other clinical tales |year=1998 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-684-85394-9 |edition=1st Touchstone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
According to [[Oliver Sacks]]' ''[[Hallucinations (book)|Hallucinations]]'', the first known medical report of musical hallucinations was published in 1846, by French alienist Jules Baillarger.&lt;ref name="Sacks"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sacks |first=Oliver |title=Hallucinations |year=2012 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-95724-5 |edition=1st American}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first scientific description of the disorder was reported in the early 1900s. In the last two decades, Berrios has reported case studies in 1990 and 1991 along with Keshavan et al. in 1992. Berrios concluded that confirmed diagnoses of deafness, ear disease, brain disease, advanced age and drug use are all important factors in the development of musical hallucinations. After analyzing 46 cases, Berrios found a female predominance of 80% in women over the age of 60. The study concluded that musical hallucinations were more likely to be seen in elderly women affected by deafness or brain disease than in individuals with no psychiatric illness at all.&lt;ref name ="Berrios"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berrios |first=GE |title=Musical hallucinations. A historical and clinical study |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |year=1990 |volume=156 |issue=2 |pages=188–94 |pmid=2180526 |doi=10.1192/bjp.156.2.188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keshavan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keshavan |first=M.S. |author2=David, A.S. |author3=Steingard, S. |author4=Lishman, W.A.  |title=Musical hallucinations: a review and synthesis |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology |year=1992 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=211–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keshevan and Berrios were the first authors to identify classes of musical hallucinations. These classes consisted of hearing loss, coarse brain disease (i.e. tumors), [[epilepsy|epileptic disorder]], [[stroke]], and psychiatric disorder. Although no statistical analyses were performed, the authors stated that deafness was the most strongly related factor in musical hallucinations and that there was a female predominance, which could entail a genetic component.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berrios" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Keshavan" /&gt;

'''The New Mobility Agenda''' is an international institution which, although a virtual and open collaborative project today, was originally set up by an international working group meeting at the [[Royaumont Abbey|Abbey de Royaumont]] near [[Paris]] in 1974 with the support of the Parisian [[OECD]] to challenge old ideas and practices in the field of urban transport through a long term collaborative program of information exchange, education and peer support. The Agenda today draws together the experience, expertise and support of more than four thousand individuals and groups worldwide in an open collaborative peer network. One of the original proponents of this approach, Professor [[Mikoto Usui]] then director of the OECD Development Centre, referred to it in the founding meeting at the "Abbé de Royaumont as an "invisible college".  Drawing together the experience and expertise of more than four thousand individuals and groups worldwide, who are networked via a combination of websites, discussion groups and fora, and collaborative projects, the Agenda takes an approach to transportation planning, policy and practice that has gained considerable force over the last two decades—provides a leading-edge alternative to earlier (20th century) methods of looking at and providing mobility for people and goods in cities.  The Agenda has received prestigious awards for its contributions, including the [[Stockholm Environment Challenge Prize]] (2000) and the [[World Technology Environment Award]] (2002).

Like the [[sustainable transportation]] movement,  to which it is closely related, it differs from previous methods (which in fact still dominate planning, policy, investment and operations in most parts of the world) in that it takes a global or broad [[systemic approach]] to the challenges of how to get around in cities, and is especially sensitive not only to pure transport efficiency (which traditionally is interpreted in pure engineering terms as speed and volume of vehicle throughput) but equally to matters of [[sustainable development]], [[pollution]] and [[Environmental degradation|environmental impacts]]—including matters relating to [[climate change]], the reduction of [[Greenhouse gas]]es, [[resource efficiency]], [[energy conservation]], [[public health]], both personal and public economics, overall [[time saving]]s, [[public spaces]], and [[quality of life]] in communities, including relations between people in public spaces – with particular attention to [[social justice]] and the unmet needs of women, children, and others with mobility or economic or health disadvantages which are not being properly served in our present mainly [[car-based systems]] and thinking, in which other forms of transport, including  [[public transport]], play only residual roles.

== New Mobility vs. Sustainable Transportation ==
These two are closely related but not identical concepts. The term "[[Sustainable Transportation]]" had it origins in the mid-eighties and has developed over time and for the most part with particular emphasis on informing transport and environmental policy, with support from a number of university programs, NGOs and from some international and government organizations. By contrast the term New Mobility Agenda takes the issues of sustainable transportation the other way around: by emphasizing the supply side—and specifically targets projects and programs which demonstrate and achieve the basic principles behind sustainable transportation.

== Targeted near-term improvements ==
A distinguishing aspect of the new mobility approach is its emphasis on the importance of targeted near-term improvements. It does not give up at all on long term thinking, but in response to what are increasingly understood to be unacceptable levels of pressure coming from current transportation arrangements, and the speed with which this degradation is taking place, there is a growing consensus that projects and measures should be targeting substantial improvements within a period of two or four years.  In most places this also coincides with the electoral terms of those in office, thus giving those elected an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to more sustainable transportation arrangements.

== New Mobility and New Urbanism ==
These two movements share a common base of concern about the importance of bringing new approaches to the manner in which we structure our cities.   Both key on facilitating the move to more economically and environmentally efficient higher density communities.  Collaboration between the two independent programs is just getting underway

== In Brief ==
The New Mobility Agenda looks for and coordinates a complex ''bouquet'' of overlapping mobility services in an attempt to offer a high quality multi-level alternative – or complement – to the mostly car-based transport system of the city. Services most often incorporated into this multi-level alternative transport system include: [[Travel avoidance]], [[land use planning]], [[mixed use]], [[Transportation Demand Management]], [[Telecommuting]], [[Telework]], [[e-work]], [[Public space]] management, [[Shared space]], [[Human-powered transport]], [[Walking]] and [[Walkability]] , [[Pedestrianization]], [[Promenadology]], [[Traffic Calming]], [[Cycling]], [[public bicycle systems]], [[utility cycling]], [[public transit priority systems]], [[Bus rapid transit]], [[Car diets/reduction plans]],  [[HOV]], [[Intelligent transportation system]], LOV ([[Low-Occupancy Vehicle]]), [[Park and ride]], [[Parking]], [[Road diets]], [[Single-occupancy vehicle|SOV]], [[Single Occupancy Vehicle]], [[Toll roads]],   [[Car rental]] , [[Car Free Days]], [[Carpooling]], [[Carsharing]],  [[flexible working]], [[flextime]], [[Hitch-hiking]],   [[Share taxi#Jitney|Jitney]], [[Midibus]], [[Mini-bus]], [[xTransit]],   [[Public transport]], [[Ride sharing]], [[economic instruments]], [[Congestion charging]], [[road pricing]], [[Full cost pricing]],  [[Roller skating]], [[Self-Organizing Collaborative Networks]], [[Share taxi]]s, [[Taxicab]],  [[Vanpooling]].

The individual components of ‘new mobility’, transportation modes and policies including those listed just above, are in generally broadly well understood and defined, at least at the leading edge. But what makes the whole an "agenda" stems from the fact that new mobility policies are based on the development and orchestration of extensive packages of measures which need to be brought on line over time and as experience and demonstrated competence with these new approaches develops. Hence the totality is referred to as an "agenda"

Continental Europe is leading the way in understanding and implementing the New Mobility Agenda, and the increasingly higher quality of their transportation systems performance and their life quality and environmental impacts are immediately visible to both visitors and those who live there.  German, Swiss, Dutch, Austrian, Danish, and increasingly the cities of France, Belgium, Northern Italy, and the rest of Scandinavia are joining in the new mobility/quality of life sweepstakes, driven as much by pride and strong local leadership as by purely negative factors (those these are many and important movers as well). A process has been engaged in Europe which other parts of the world are looking at and starting to emulate: cities increasingly looking at themselves and each other scanning for good ideas that they can take home and adapt for their communities.  This is thus an example of a virtuous spiral.  The [[European Commission]] has played an important supporting role in this process.

== Terminology ==
To appreciate fully what "[[new mobility]]" means, it is useful to see how it differs from "Old Mobility" (often defined as being stuck in traffic, waiting in the rain for a bus that may never come, or paying large amounts of taxpayer dollars for "improvements" that ultimately find us still late for work or waiting for that bus. (See the multi-media presentation of  A Day In The Life of New Mobility for one characterization of how it might look in day-to-day life in one city.)

What we now call  "old mobility’ thinking and practice is in effect the dominant paradigm of 20th century visions and practices. It is/was essentially oriented to the search for engineering, technological and infrastructural solutions for increasing speed and throughput capacity in specific links and at key points (including bottlenecks). The old mobility paradigm was one that has been characterized as "forecast (growth) and build".  Old mobility solutions more often than not cost a lot of money, and created a broadly shared mind-set in which the main limit to providing for yet further capacity increases within the system was constrained only by funding limitations from public sources. The old system was and is essentially hierarchical and "expert oriented and controlled". It is still dominant in many cities and parts of the world today.

(Since this entry is still in progress, here is an attempt to characterize the present arrangements and constraints that form it very broadly. By understanding these – if (a) true and (b) really a problem – we have a base for fine-tuning our proposed new solutions.  So, here is how old mobility looks from the specific vantage of the proponents of the New Mobility Agenda:

# Based on an essentially closed system (looking at "transport" in isolation from the rest)
# Hierarchical
# Top-down
# Centralized
# Statistics based (historical)
# Bounded
# Reductive
# End-state solution oriented
# Authoritarian
# Supply oriented
# Oriented to maximizing vehicle throughput and speeds
# Expert based
# Engineering-based (i.e., working "within the box", but with high technical competence)
# Binary: i.e., either "private" (i.e., car-based) or "public" transport (and nothing of importance in between)
# De facto car-based
# Costly to the community (unnecessarily)
# Costly to individuals (unnecessarily)
# Resource intensive (unnecessarily)
# Total dependence on costly imported fossil fuels (unnecessarily)
# Highly polluting
# Massive public health menace
# Destroys urban fabric
# Hardware and build solutions, technology oriented
# Treats ex-car solutions as (very!) poor cousins
# Offers poor service/economic package to elderly, handicapped, poor and young
# Sharp divide between planning, policy and operations
# Obscure (to the public) decision making processes
# Focuses on bottlenecks impeding traffic flows (i.e., builds for &gt; traffic)
# Attempts to anticipate them and build to forestall
# Searches for large projects to "solve" the problems
# These large projects and the substantial amounts involved often lead to corruption and waste of public moneys
# Still too much separation from underlying land use realities.
# Inadequate attention to transportation substitutes or complements
# Increasingly technical and tool oriented (this to the good)
# Anachronistic,
# Not doing the job that we need in 2005 and beyond!, and finally and worst of all. . .
# Creates a climate of passive citizenry and thus undermines participatory democracy and collective involvement and problem solving

The heart of new mobility policy by contrast is [[systemic complexity]], diversity, participation, wide outreach and a wide array of [[partnerships]] and other forms of synergistic interaction and collaboration.  It more often involves the orchestration of a large number of measures and policies, many of which often very small in themselves, in order to provide a dispersed modern city encompassing many different types of people and mobility needs – as opposed to the "big solution" approaches often favored in the past (whether major highway or [[road building]] or extensions, new [[Rapid transit]] ([[metros]], [[Subway (rail)|subways]] or other expensive [[rail systems]], massive central parking structures, and the like).  The goal of the planners and authorities changes radically with this new paradigm, such that rather than "solving problems" with centrally planned and executed engineering and measurement; they start to get more involved in multi-level complex problem-solving, which brings them to such quite different kinds of approaches such as community outreach and orchestration of services and the participation of a much larger number of actors and players.

The New Mobility Agenda addresses the issues on both the supply and demand sides. It thus combines Transportation Demand Management [[Transportation Demand Management|TDM]] strategies and measures for containing, channeling and limiting wasteful and encumbering private car traffic in cities, with coordinated support of a wide "bouquet" of alternative transportation arrangements.  These include various forms of [[Human-powered transport]], [[utility cycling]], [[walking]], [[public space]] improvement, electronic substitutes for travel (such as [[telework]], [[telecommuting]] or [[e-work]]) and a variety of shared and [[public transport]] strategies, new and old, including [[HOV]] (High Occupancy Vehicles), [[carpooling]], [[ride sharing]], [[car rentals]], [[taxicab]], [[Share taxi]], [[Share taxi#Jitney|Jitney]]s, and the list goes on (see long list of modes and component parts in '''Internal Links''' below).

== History ==
What is today known as the New Mobility Agenda has had many antecedents and both before and since has proceeded in many places and on many fronts as [[traffic congestion]] and more generally the weight and poor performance—environmental, economic, social, and destruction of urban fabric—of the old, mainly car-based mobility system has increasingly made itself felt in city after city around the world.  Unsurprisingly the worst problems we are seeing today are in the cities of the developing countries, and most of all in their megacities – in most of which the old mobility thinking continues to carry the day in policy and investment circles who are proving slow to adjust. Over the last two decades this movement has steadily gained force to the point where  a growing array of programs and authorities are coming together in an attempt to create more balanced transportation systems, better equipped for dealing with the highly diverse mobility needs of people of all social and economic classes in the 21st century. (See references below for some of these.)

The '''New Mobility Agenda''' provides an example of a focused, international [[Self-Organizing Collaborative Network]] applied to the challenges of transport in cities. And while its antecedents are as old as the first time anyone got stuck in traffic and wondered about how things might be better organized, the actual "New Mobility Agenda" by that name was formally kicked off in 1996 during the [[OECD]] International Conference in [[Vancouver]] [[Canada]] (24–27 March 1996) under the title ''Towards Sustainable Transportation''.

In the wake of the 1996 ''Towards Sustainable Transportation'' conference, two things happened immediately which started to give concrete expression to this new movement.

* Working in cooperation with the [[OECD]]'s program [[EST – Environmentally Sustainable Transportation]] program a long-standing open expert forum organized on the topic area under [[The Commons: Open Society Sustainability Initiative]] in 1974 decided to relaunch their existing STEP program (Sustainable Transportation Emergency Program) with the name ''New Mobility Agenda''.  This program and its extensions today  bring together more than four thousand international experts and activists working in this area, and is guided by an  International Advisory Council. These individuals and groups are at work to develop a common frame of information and understanding mediated by a collection of exchange mechanisms, including a whole series of web sites, blogs, newsgroups, and periodic conferences, both physical and using the latest low cost video and voice conferencing techniques.
* In parallel the City of [[Toronto]] launched a program, Moving the Economy with an explicit  "New Mobility" Strategy, which continues to be active.  The City has also created its own New Mobility HUB Network, which is supported by a New Mobility HUB Survey which can be usefully applied with only minor adaptations to any other community.

== Collaborative New Mobility city projects, 1 Sept. 2007 update ==

Recent collaborative projects that are presently (early 2007) getting considerable attention in specialist and policy circles around the world, include the relaunching of the Journal of World Transport Policy and Practice include the continuation of the [[Toronto]] (Canada) New Mobility Hub regional network and their latest Seamless Link program. In parallel the open group has launched the New Mobility Advisory/Briefs program which is aimed specifically to engage mayors and city leaders to give more attention to low cost remedial measures and projects offering near term relief. The Agenda has also recently created a handful of open video libraries which can be accessed via ''New Mobility Video Library.''

The New Mobility program is in its work supporting the 1 August 2006 call of  the Clinton Climate Initiative for 80% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reductions in cities over the next ten – fifteen years.  While not affiliated with the Clinton project, that is primarily looking at technology-based reforms in the largest world cities, the New Mobility program is concentrating on strategies to bring about major institutional  reforms and a massive repartitioning of the transportation arrangements of cities of all sizes, including in the high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sprawl areas that surround center cites.

The following cities are currently looking at eventual New Mobility projects and strategies: Paris, Stuttgart, Chicago, Washington DC, New York City, Vancouver, Santa Barbara (CA).

=== Supply (New Mobility Building Blocks) ===
One point that needs to be made concerning these building blocks, is that in any given city these will involve at least ''hundreds'' of coordinated actions, many of which carried out by or requiring the active support of groups outside of the traditional public and transport sector.

Traditionally an '''oath''' (from [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''{{lang|ang|[[:wikt:að|āð]]}}'', also called '''plight''') is either a [[utterance|statement]] of [[fact]] or a [[promise]] with wording relating to something considered [[sacred]] as a sign of verity. A common legal substitute for those who conscientiously object to making sacred oaths is to give an [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] instead. Nowadays, even when there is no notion of sanctity involved, certain promises said out loud in ceremonial or juridical purpose are referred to as oaths. "To [[:wikt:swear|swear]]" is a [[verb]] used to describe the taking of an oath, to making a solemn [[vow]].

==Divine oath==
Usually oaths have referred to a [[deity]] significant in the cultural sphere in question. The reciter's personal views upon the divinity of the aspects considered sacred in a predictated text of an oath may or may not be taken in to account. There might not be alternative personal proclamations with no mention of the sacred [[dogma]] in question, such as affirmations, to be made. This might mean an [[impasse]] to those with unwillingness to edify the dogma they see as untrue and those who decline to refer to sacred matters on the subject at hand.

The essence of a divine oath is an invocation of divine agency to be a guarantor of the oath taker's own honesty and integrity in the matter under question. By implication, this invokes divine displeasure if the oath taker fails in their sworn duties. It therefore implies greater care than usual in the act of the performance of one's duty, such as in testimony to the facts of the matter in a court of law.

A person taking an oath indicates this in a number of ways. The most usual is the explicit "I swear", but any statement or promise that includes "with * as my witness" or "so help me *", with '*' being something or someone the oath-taker holds sacred, is an oath. Many people take an oath by holding in their hand or placing over their head a book of [[scripture]] or a sacred object, thus indicating the sacred witness through their action: such an oath is called ''corporal''. However, the chief purpose of such an act is for ceremony or solemnity, and the act does not of itself make an oath.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

==Historical development as a legal concept==
Making vows and taking oaths became a symbolic concept in law practice that developed over time in different cultures.

=== Jewish tradition ===
The concept of oaths is deeply rooted within [[Judaism]]. It is found in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 8:21, when God swears that he will "never again curse the ground because of man and never again smite every living thing". This repetition of the term ''never again'' is explained by [[Rashi]], the pre-eminent biblical commentator, as serving as an oath, citing the [[Talmud]] Shavous 36a for this ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Metsudah Chumash and Rashi, KTAV Publishing House, 1991. page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The first personage in the biblical tradition to take an oath is held to be [[Eliezer]], the chief servant of [[Abraham]], when the latter requested of the former that he not take a wife for his son [[Isaac]] from the daughters of Canaan, but rather from among Abraham's own family.

The foundational text for oath making is in  [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 30:2: "When a man voweth a vow unto the Lord, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth." According to the Rabbis, a [[neder]] (usually translated as "vow") refers to the object, a ''shâmar'' (usually translated as "oath") to the person. The passage distinguishes between a ''neder'' and a ''shvua'', an important distinction between the two in [[Halakha]]: a ''neder'' changes the status of some external thing, while a ''shvua'' initiates an internal change in the one who swears the oath.

=== Roman tradition ===
In the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] tradition, oaths were sworn upon ''[[Iuppiter Lapis]]'' or the Jupiter Stone located in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Jupiter]], [[Capitoline Hill]]. ''Iuppiter Lapis'' was held in the Roman tradition to be an [[Oath Stone]], an aspect of Jupiter in his role as divine law-maker responsible for order and used principally for the investiture of the oathtaking of office.

According to Cyril Bailey, in "The Religion of Ancient Rome" (1907):

{{Quote| text=We have, for instance, the sacred stone (''[[Silex#Archaic and foreign uses|silex]]'') which was preserved in the temple of Iuppiter on the Capitol, and was brought out to play a prominent part in the ceremony of treaty-making. The [[fetial]], who on that occasion represented the Roman people, at the solemn moment of the oath-taking, struck the sacrificial pig with the ''silex'', saying as he did so, "Do thou, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Diespiter]], strike the Roman people as I strike this pig here to-day, and strike them the more, as thou art greater and stronger." Here no doubt the underlying notion is not merely symbolical, but in origin the stone is itself the god, an idea which later religion expressed in the cult-title specially used in this connection, ''Iuppiter Lapis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Cyril |date=1907 |title=The Religion of Ancient Rome |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18564/18564-h/18564-h.htm#CHAPTER_II |location=London |publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co. Ltd. |page=7 |access-date=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The punisher of broken oaths was the [[Hell|infernal]] deity [[Orcus]].

=== Greek tradition ===
[[Walter Burkert]] has shown that since [[Lycurgus of Athens]] (d. 324 BCE), who held that "it is the oath which holds democracy together", religion, morality and political organization had been linked by the oath, and the oath and its prerequisite altar had become the basis of both civil and criminal, as well as international law.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', trans. Raffan, Harvard University Press (1985), 250ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christian tradition===

Various religious groups have objected to the taking of oaths, most notably the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) and [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] groups, like [[Mennonite]]s, [[Amish]], [[Hutterite]]s and [[Schwarzenau Brethren]]. This is principally based on {{Bibleverse||Matthew|5:34–37}}, the [[Antithesis of the Law]]. Here, Christ is written to say "I say to you: '[[Swear not at all]]{{'"}}. [[James the Just]] stated in {{Bibleverse|James|5:12}}, "Above all, my brothers, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. Let your 'Yes' be yes, and your 'No', no, or you will be condemned." Beyond this scriptural authority, Quakers place importance on being truthful at all times, so the testimony opposing oaths springs from a view that "taking legal oaths implies a double standard of truthfulness"&lt;ref&gt;Faith and Practice of Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (1988) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that truthfulness in legal contexts is somehow more important than truthfulness in non-legal contexts and that truthfulness in those other contexts is therefore somehow less important.

Not all [[Christianity|Christians]] interpret this reading as forbidding all types of oaths, however. Opposition to oath-taking among some groups of Christian caused many problems for these groups throughout their history. [[Quaker]]s were frequently imprisoned because of their refusal to swear [[loyalty oath]]s. Testifying in court was also difficult; [[George Fox]], Quakers' founder, famously challenged a judge who had asked him to swear, saying that he would do so once the judge could point to any [[Bible]] passage where Jesus or his apostles took oaths. (The judge could not, but this did not allow Fox to escape punishment.) Legal reforms from the 18th century onwards mean that everyone in the [[United Kingdom]] now has the right to make a solemn [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] instead of an oath. The [[United States]] has permitted affirmations since it was founded; it is explicitly mentioned in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. Only President [[Franklin Pierce]] has chosen to affirm rather than swear at his inauguration.

As late as 1880, [[Charles Bradlaugh]] was denied a seat as an MP in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] because of his professed [[atheism]] as he was judged unable to swear the [[Oath of Allegiance (UK)|Oath of Allegiance]] in spite of his proposal to swear the oath as a "matter of form".

=== Islam ===
Islam takes the fulfillment of oaths extremely seriously.
{{quote|God does not hold you responsible for the mere utterance of oaths; He holds you responsible for your actual intentions. If you violate an oath, you shall atone by feeding ten poor people from the same food you offer to your own family, or clothing them, or by freeing a slave. If you cannot afford this, then you shall fast three days. This is the atonement for violating the oaths that you swore to keep. You shall fulfill your oaths. God thus explains His revelations to you, that you may be appreciative.|Quran Chapter 5: Verse 89}}

=== Germanic tradition ===
{{Further|Symbel|Feudalism}}
[[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] [[warrior culture]] was significantly based on oaths of fealty.

A prose passage inserted in the eddic poem ''[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]'' relates:
Hedin was coming home alone from the forest one [[Yule]]-eve, and found a [[troll]]-woman; she rode on a wolf, and had snakes in place of a bridle. She asked Hedin for his company. "Nay," said he. She said, "Thou shalt pay for this at the ''bragarfull''." That evening the great vows were taken; the sacred boar was brought in, the men laid their hands thereon, and took their vows at the ''bragarfull''. Hedin vowed that he would have Sváva, Eylimi's daughter, the beloved of his brother Helgi; then such great grief seized him that he went forth on wild paths southward over the land, and found Helgi, his brother.

Such Norse traditions are directly parallel to the "bird oaths" of late medieval France, such as the [[voeux du faisan]] (oath on the pheasant) or the (fictional) [[voeux du paon]] (oath on the peacock). Huizinga, ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages]]'' (ch. 3); Michel Margue, "Vogelgelübde" am Hof des Fürsten. Ritterliches Integrationsritual zwischen Traditions- und Gegenwartsbezug (14. – 15. Jahrhundert)

=== Modern law ===
{{redirect|Under oath|the American rock band|Underoath}}
In the modern law, oaths are made by a witness to a court of law before giving testimony and usually by a newly appointed government officer to the people of a state before taking office. 

However, in both of those cases, an [[affirmation in law|affirmation]] can usually be replaced with a written statement, only if the author swears the statement is true. This statement is called an ''[[affidavit]]''. 

The oath given to support an affidavit is frequently administered by a [[notary]], who will certify the giving of the oath by affixing her or his seal to the document. Willfully delivering a false oath (or affirmation) is the crime of [[perjury]]. 

There are some places where there is a confusion between the "oath" and other statements or promises. For example, the current [[Olympic Oath]] is really a [[Promise|pledge]], not properly an oath, since there is only a promise but there is no appeal to a sacred witness.

Oaths may also be confused with [[vow]]s, but vows are really just a special kind of an oath.

Instead of, or in addition to, holding one's hand upon an object of ceremonial importance, it can be customary for a person swearing an oath to hold a raised hand in a specific gesture. Most often the right hand is raised. This custom has been explained with reference to medieval practices of branding palms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;se=gglsc&amp;d=454360]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perception''' (from the [[Latin]] ''perceptio'') is the organization, identification, and interpretation of [[sense|sensory]] [[information]] in order to represent and understand the presented information, or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel |title=Psychology |year=2011 |publisher = Worth Publishers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All perception involves signals that go through the [[nervous system]], which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the [[Sensory nervous system|sensory system]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein5"&gt;Goldstein (2009) pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; For example, vision involves [[photon|light]] striking the [[retina]] of the [[eye]], smell is mediated by [[Olfactory system#Peripheral|odor molecules]], and [[hearing]] involves [[sound wave|pressure waves]].

Perception is not only the passive receipt of these signals, but it's also shaped by the recipient's [[Perceptual learning|learning]], [[memory]], [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]], and [[attention]].&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein2010" /&gt;

Perception can be split into two processes, &lt;ref name="Bernstein2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernstein |first=Douglas A. |title = Essentials of Psychology |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rd77N0KsLVkC&amp;pg=PA123 |accessdate=25 March 2011 |date=5 March 2010 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-90693-3 |pages=123–124 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170102091148/https://books.google.com/books?id=rd77N0KsLVkC&amp;pg=PA123 |archivedate=2 January 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) processing the sensory input, which transforms these low-level information to higher-level information (e.g., extracts shapes for object recognition), (2) processing which is connected with a person's concepts and expectations (or knowledge), restorative and selective mechanisms (such as [[attention]]) that influence perception.

Perception depends on complex functions of the nervous system, but subjectively seems mostly effortless because this processing happens outside conscious awareness. &lt;ref name="Goldstein5" /&gt;

Since the rise of [[experimental psychology]] in the 19th century, [[perceptual psychology|psychology's understanding of perception]] has progressed by combining a variety of techniques.&lt;ref name="mind_perception"&gt;[[Richard Gregory|Gregory, Richard]]. "Perception" in Gregory, Zangwill (1987) pp.&amp;nbsp;598–601.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychophysics]] quantitatively describes the relationships between the physical qualities of the sensory input and perception.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustav Fechner|Gustav Theodor Fechner]]. Elemente der Psychophysik. Leipzig 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sensory neuroscience]] studies the neural mechanisms underlying perception. Perceptual systems can also be studied [[computation]]ally, in terms of the information they process. [[Philosophy of perception|Perceptual issues in philosophy]] include the extent to which sensory qualities such as sound, smell or color exist in objective reality rather than in the mind of the perceiver.&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt;

Although the senses were traditionally viewed as passive receptors, the study of [[illusion]]s and [[ambiguous image]]s has demonstrated that the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously attempt to make sense of their input.&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt; There is still active debate about the extent to which perception is an active process of [[hypothesis]] testing, analogous to [[science]], or whether realistic sensory information is rich enough to make this process unnecessary.&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt;

The [[perceptual system]]s of the [[brain]] enable individuals to see the world around them as stable, even though the sensory information is typically incomplete and rapidly varying. Human and animal brains are structured in a [[cognitive module|modular way]], with different areas processing different kinds of sensory information. Some of these modules take the form of [[Sensory Maps|sensory maps]], mapping some aspect of the world across part of the brain's surface. These different modules are interconnected and influence each other. For instance, [[taste]] is strongly influenced by smell.&lt;ref name="DeVereCalvert2010_33" /&gt;

== Process and terminology ==
&lt;!-- linked from disambiguation: update or define {{Anchor|Process and terminology}} if changed --&gt;
The process of perception begins with an object in the real world, termed the ''distal stimulus'' or ''distal object''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5"/&gt; By means of light, sound or another physical process, the object stimulates the body's sensory organs. These sensory organs transform the input energy into neural activity—a process called ''transduction''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pomerantz" /&gt; This raw pattern of neural activity is called the ''proximal stimulus''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5"/&gt; These neural signals are transmitted to the brain and processed.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5" /&gt; The resulting mental re-creation of the distal stimulus is the ''percept''.

An example would be a shoe. The shoe itself is the distal stimulus. When light from the shoe enters a person's eye and stimulates the retina, that stimulation is the proximal stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.learner.org/discoveringpsychology/07/e07glossary.html |title = Sensation and Perception |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110510081956/http://www.learner.org/discoveringpsychology/07/e07glossary.html |archivedate = 10 May 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The image of the shoe reconstructed by the brain of the person is the percept. Another example would be a telephone ringing. The ringing of the telephone is the distal stimulus. The sound stimulating a person's auditory receptors is the proximal stimulus, and the brain's interpretation of this as the ringing of a telephone is the percept. The different kinds of sensation such as warmth, sound, and taste are called ''[[stimulus modality|sensory modalities]]''.&lt;ref name="pomerantz"&gt;Pomerantz, James R. (2003): "Perception: Overview". In: Lynn Nadel (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, London: Nature Publishing Group, pp.&amp;nbsp;527–537.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WillisCoggeshall2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=William D. |last2=Coggeshall |first2=Richard E. |title=Sensory Mechanisms of the Spinal Cord: Primary afferent neurons and the spinal dorsal horn |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uqnKCewO2voC&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=25 March 2011 |date=31 January 2004 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-306-48033-1 |page = 1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162356/http://books.google.com/books?id=uqnKCewO2voC&amp;pg=PA1 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Jerome Bruner]] has developed a model of perception. According to him, people go through the following process to form opinions:&lt;ref name="Alan"&gt;Alan S. &amp; Gary J. (2011). Perception, Attribution, and Judgment of Others. Organizational Behaviour: Understanding and Managing Life at Work,  Vol. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

# When we encounter an unfamiliar target, we are open to different informational cues and want to learn more about the target.
# In the second step, we try to collect more information about the target. Gradually, we encounter some familiar cues which help us categorize the target.
# At this stage, the cues become less open and selective. We try to search for more cues that confirm the categorization of the target. We also actively ignore and even distort cues that violate our initial perceptions. Our perception becomes more selective and we finally paint a consistent picture of the target.

According to [[Alan Saks]] and [[Gary Johns]], there are three components to perception.&lt;ref name="Alan"/&gt;

# The Perceiver, the person who becomes aware about something and comes to a final understanding. There are 3 factors that can influence his or her perceptions: experience, motivational state and finally emotional state. In different motivational or emotional states, the perceiver will react to or perceive something in different ways. Also in different situations he or she might employ a "perceptual defence" where they tend to "see what they want to see".
# The Target. This is the person who is being perceived or judged. "Ambiguity or lack of information about a target leads to a greater need for interpretation and addition."
# The Situation also greatly influences perceptions because different situations may call for additional information about the target.

Stimuli are not necessarily translated into a percept and rarely does a single stimulus translate into a percept. An ambiguous stimulus may be translated into multiple percepts, experienced randomly, one at a time, in what is called ''[[multistable perception]]''. And the same stimuli, or absence of them, may result in different percepts depending on subject's culture and previous experiences. Ambiguous figures demonstrate that a single stimulus can result in more than one percept; for example the [[Rubin vase]] which can be interpreted either as a vase or as two faces. The percept can bind sensations from multiple senses into a whole. A picture of a talking person on a television screen, for example, is bound to the sound of speech from speakers to form a percept of a talking person. "'''Percept'''" is also a term used by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz' ''Monadology''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bergson]], [[Deleuze]], and [[Guattari]]&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari's ''What is Philosophy?''&lt;/ref&gt; to define perception independent from perceivers.

==Reality==
In the case of visual perception, some people can actually see the percept shift in their [[mind's eye]].&lt;ref name=Wettlaufer2003&gt;{{Cite book | last = Wettlaufer | first = Alexandra K. | year = 2003 | title = In the mind's eye : the visual impulse in Diderot, Baudelaire and Ruskin, pg. 257 | isbn = 90-420-1035-5 | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, who are not [[Picture thinking|picture thinkers]], may not necessarily perceive the 'shape-shifting' as their world changes. The 'esemplastic' nature has been shown by experiment: an [[ambiguous image]] has multiple interpretations on the perceptual level.

This confusing ambiguity of perception is exploited in human technologies such as [[camouflage]], and also in biological [[mimicry]], for example by [[European peacock|European peacock butterflies]], whose wings bear [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] that birds respond to as though they were the eyes of a dangerous predator.

There is also evidence that the brain in some ways operates on a slight "delay", to allow nerve impulses from distant parts of the body to be integrated into simultaneous signals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104183551 The Secret Advantage Of Being Short] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521081301/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104183551 |date=21 May 2009 }} by Robert Krulwich. ''All Things Considered'', NPR. 18 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perception is one of the oldest fields in psychology. The oldest quantitative laws in psychology are [[Weber-Fechner law|Weber's law]] – which states that the smallest noticeable difference in stimulus intensity is proportional to the intensity of the reference – and [[Weber-Fechner law|Fechner's law]] which quantifies the relationship between the intensity of the physical stimulus and its perceptual counterpart (for example, testing how much darker a computer screen can get before the viewer actually notices). The study of perception gave rise to the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] school of psychology, with its emphasis on [[Holism|holistic]] approach.

''Perceptual constancy'' is the ability of perceptual systems to recognize the same object from widely varying sensory inputs.&lt;ref name="Bernstein2010"/&gt;{{rp|118–120}}&lt;ref name="AtkinsonAtkinson1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkinson|first1=Rita L.|last2=Atkinson|first2=Richard C.|last3=Smith|first3=Edward E.|title=Introduction to psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nw54PwAACAAJ|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=March 1990|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=978-0-15-543689-3|pages=177–183|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162907/http://books.google.com/books?id=Nw54PwAACAAJ|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, individual people can be recognized from views, such as frontal and profile, which form very different shapes on the retina. A coin looked at face-on makes a circular image on the retina, but when held at angle it makes an elliptical image.&lt;ref name="eop_constancy" /&gt; In normal perception these are recognized as a single three-dimensional object.

===Grouping===
{{main article|Principles of grouping}}

[[File:Gestalt closure.svg|right|thumb|Law of Closure. The human brain tends to perceive complete shapes even if those forms are incomplete.]]

The ''principles of grouping'' (or ''Gestalt laws of grouping'') are a set of principles in [[psychology]], first proposed by [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologists]] to explain how humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects. Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to [[perceive]] patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules. These principles are [[Principles of grouping|organized into six categories]]: ''proximity, similarity, closure, good continuation, common fate'' and ''good form''.

The principle of ''proximity'' states that, all else being equal, perception tends to group stimuli that are close together as part of the same object, and [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] that are far apart as two separate objects. The principle of ''similarity'' states that, all else being equal, perception lends itself to seeing stimuli that physically resemble each other as part of the same object, and stimuli that are different as part of a different object. This allows for people to distinguish between adjacent and overlapping objects based on their [[visual]] texture and resemblance. The principle of ''closure'' refers to the mind's tendency to see complete figures or forms even if a picture is incomplete, partially hidden by other objects, or if part of the information needed to make a complete picture in our minds is missing. For example, if part of a shape's border is missing people still tend to see the shape as completely enclosed by the border and ignore the gaps. The principle of ''good continuation'' makes sense of stimuli that overlap: when there is an intersection between two or more objects, people tend to perceive each as a single uninterrupted object. The principle of ''common fate'' groups stimuli together on the basis of their movement. When visual elements are seen moving in the same direction at the same rate, perception associates the movement as part of the same stimulus. This allows people to make out moving objects even when other details, such as color or outline, are obscured. The principle of ''good form'' refers to the tendency to group together forms of similar shape, pattern, [[color]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Peter O.

===Contrast effects===
{{main article|Contrast effect}}

A common finding across many different kinds of perception is that the perceived qualities of an object can be affected by the qualities of context. If one object is extreme on some dimension, then neighboring objects are perceived as further away from that extreme. "Simultaneous contrast effect" is the term used when stimuli are presented at the same time, whereas "successive contrast" applies when stimuli are presented one after another.&lt;ref name="Corsini2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corsini|first=Raymond J.|title=The dictionary of psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0uxnglHzYaoC&amp;pg=PA219|accessdate=24 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-58391-328-4|page=219|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162655/http://books.google.com/books?id=0uxnglHzYaoC&amp;pg=PA219|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast effect was noted by the 17th Century philosopher [[John Locke]], who observed that lukewarm water can feel hot or cold, depending on whether the hand touching it was previously in hot or cold water.&lt;ref name="Kushner2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kushner |first=Laura H. |title=Contrast in judgments of mental health |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TYn5VHp9jioC&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=24 March 2011 |year=2008 |publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-91314-6 |page=1 |deadurl=no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163219/http://books.google.com/books?id=TYn5VHp9jioC&amp;pg=PA1 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th Century, [[Wilhelm Wundt]] identified contrast as a fundamental principle of perception, and since then the effect has been confirmed in many different areas.&lt;ref name="Kushner2008" /&gt; These effects shape not only visual qualities like color and brightness, but other kinds of perception, including how heavy an object feels.&lt;ref name="Plous1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Plous|first=Scott|title=The psychology of judgment and decision making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvWOQgAACAAJ|accessdate=24 March 2011|year=1993|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-050477-6|pages=38–41|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162735/http://books.google.com/books?id=xvWOQgAACAAJ|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One experiment found that thinking of the name "Hitler" led to subjects rating a person as more hostile.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moskowitz|first=Gordon B.|title=Social cognition: understanding self and others |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&amp;pg=PA421 |accessdate=24 March 2011|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-085-2 |page=421|deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163155/http://books.google.com/books?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&amp;pg=PA421 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a piece of music is perceived as good or bad can depend on whether the music heard before it was pleasant or unpleasant.&lt;ref name="Popper2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Popper|first=Arthur N.|title=Music Perception |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYXd3CF1_vkC&amp;pg=PA150 |accessdate=24 March 2011 |date=30 November 2010 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-6113-6 |page=150 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163046/http://books.google.com/books?id=ZYXd3CF1_vkC&amp;pg=PA150 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the effect to work, the objects being compared need to be similar to each other: a television reporter can seem smaller when interviewing a tall basketball player, but not when standing next to a tall building.&lt;ref name="Plous1993"/&gt; In the brain, brightness contrast exerts effects on both neuronal firing rates and neuronal synchrony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Biederlack|first1=J.|first2=M.|last2=Castelo-Branco |first3=S.|last3=Neuenschwander|first4=D.W.|last4=Wheeler|first5= W.|last5=Singer|first6=D.|last6=Nikolić |year=2006 |title=Brightness induction: Rate enhancement and neuronal synchronization as complementary codes |journal=Neuron |volume=52 |pages=1073–1083 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2006.11.012 |pmid=17178409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of experience==
{{main article|Perceptual learning}}

With experience, [[organism]]s can learn to make finer perceptual distinctions, and learn new kinds of categorization. Wine-tasting, the reading of X-ray images and music appreciation are applications of this process in the [[human]] sphere. [[Research]] has focused on the relation of this to other kinds of [[learning]], and whether it takes place in peripheral [[sensory perception|sensory]] systems or in the brain's processing of sense information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sumner|first=Meghan|title=The Effect of Experience on the Perception and Representation of Dialect Variants|work=Journal of Memory and Language|publisher=Elsevier Inc., 2009 |accessdate=3 June 2015 |url = http://web.stanford.edu/~sumner/Publications/2009_Sumner_JML.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202011511/http://web.stanford.edu/~sumner/Publications/2009_Sumner_JML.pdf |archivedate=2 February 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Empirical]] [[research]] show that specific practices (such as [[yoga]], [[mindfulness]], [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]], [[meditation]], Daoshi and other mind-body disciplines) can modify human perceptual modality. Specifically, these practices enable perception skills to switch from the external (exteroceptive field) towards a higher ability to focus on internal signals ([[proprioception]]). Also, when asked to provide verticality judgments, highly self-transcendent [[yoga]] practitioners were significantly less influenced by a misleading visual context. Increasing self-transcendence may enable yoga practitioners to optimize verticality judgment tasks by relying more on internal (vestibular and proprioceptive) signals coming from their own body, rather than on exteroceptive, visual cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fiori| first1=Francesca |last2=David|first2=Nicole |last3=Aglioti|first3=Salvatore Maria|title=Processing of proprioceptive and vestibular body signals and self-transcendence in Ashtanga yoga practitioners|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |date=2014|volume=8 |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00734|url=http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/Abstract.aspx?s=537&amp;name=human_neuroscience&amp;ART_DOI=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of motivation and expectation==
{{main article|Set (psychology)}}
A ''perceptual set'', also called ''perceptual expectancy'' or just ''set'' is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way.&lt;ref name="Weiten2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Weiten|first=Wayne|title=Psychology: Themes and Variations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&amp;pg=PT193|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=17 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-60197-5|page=193|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163032/http://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&amp;pg=PT193|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an example of how perception can be shaped by "top-down" processes such as drives and expectations.&lt;ref name="CoonMitterer2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coon|first1=Dennis|last2=Mitterer|first2=John O.|title=Introduction to Psychology: Gateways to Mind and Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vw20LEaJe10C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=29 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-59911-1|pages=171–172|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162432/http://books.google.com/books?id=vw20LEaJe10C&amp;pg=PA171|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses.&lt;ref name="Sonderegger1998"/&gt; They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one's own name in a crowded room, or short term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=Malcolm|last2=Heyes|first2=Steve|title=Beginning Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjPWqXi9WQsC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=2 December 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-832821-6|pages=24–27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163023/http://books.google.com/books?id=fjPWqXi9WQsC&amp;pg=PA24|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple demonstration of the effect involved very brief presentations of non-words such as "sael". Subjects who were told to expect words about animals read it as "seal", but others who were expecting boat-related words read it as "sail".&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"/&gt;

Sets can be created by [[motivation]] and so can result in people interpreting ambiguous figures so that they see what they want to see.&lt;ref name="CoonMitterer2008"/&gt; For instance, how someone perceives what unfolds during a sports game can be biased if they strongly support one of the teams.&lt;ref name="BlockYuker2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Block|first1=J.

They were told that either a number or a letter would flash on the screen to say whether they were going to taste an orange juice drink or an unpleasant-tasting health drink. In fact, an ambiguous figure was flashed on screen, which could either be read as the letter B or the number 13. When the letters were associated with the pleasant task, subjects were more likely to perceive a letter B, and when letters were associated with the unpleasant task they tended to perceive a number 13.&lt;ref name="Weiten2008"/&gt;

Perceptual set has been demonstrated in many social contexts. People who are primed to think of someone as "warm" are more likely to perceive a variety of positive characteristics in them, than if the word "warm" is replaced by "cold".{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} When someone has a reputation for being funny, an audience is more likely to find them amusing.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"/&gt; Individual's perceptual sets reflect their own personality traits. For example, people with an aggressive personality are quicker to correctly identify aggressive words or situations.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"/&gt;

One classic psychological experiment showed slower reaction times and less accurate answers when a deck of [[playing cards]] reversed the color of the [[Suit (cards)|suit]] symbol for some cards (e.g. red spades and black hearts).&lt;ref&gt;"On the Perception of Incongruity: A Paradigm" by Jerome S. Bruner and Leo Postman. ''Journal of Personality'', 18, pp. 206-223. 1949.

Philosopher [[Andy Clark]] explains that perception, although it occurs quickly, is not simply a bottom-up process (where minute details are put together to form larger wholes). Instead, our brains use what he calls '[[predictive coding]]'. It starts with very broad constraints and expectations for the state of the world, and as expectations are met, it makes more detailed predictions (errors lead to new predictions, or [[learning]] processes). Clark says this research has various implications; not only can there be no completely "unbiased, unfiltered" perception, but this means that there is a great deal of feedback between perception and expectation (perceptual experiences often shape our beliefs, but those perceptions were based on existing beliefs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html|title= Predictive Coding|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131205173145/http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html|archivedate= 5 December 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Indeed, predictive coding provides an account where this type of feedback assists in stabilizing our inference-making process about the physical world, such as with perceptual constancy examples.

==Theories==

===Perception as direct perception===
[[Cognitivism (psychology)|Cognitive theories]] of perception assume there is a poverty of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. This (with reference to perception) is the claim that [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]] are, by themselves, unable to provide a unique description of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, James V. (2012): "[https://books.google.com/books?id=HZf6AQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Vision and Brain: How we perceive the world]", Cambridge, MIT Press, pp. 155-178.&lt;/ref&gt; Sensations require 'enriching', which is the role of the mental model. A different type of theory is the perceptual [[Ecological psychology|ecology]] approach of [[James J. Gibson]]. Gibson rejected the assumption of a [[poverty of stimulus]] by rejecting the notion that perception is based upon sensations&amp;nbsp;– instead, he investigated what information is actually presented to the perceptual systems. His theory "assumes the existence of stable, unbounded, and permanent stimulus-information in the [[ambient optic array]]. And it supposes that the visual system can explore and detect this information. The theory is information-based, not sensation-based."&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, James J. (2002): "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f594/23f1a766380ff945fc401b976618a2b2a92a.pdf A Theory of Direct Visual Perception]". In: Alva Noë/Evan Thompson (Eds.), ''Vision and Mind. Selected Readings in the Philosophy of Perception'', Cambridge, MIT Press, pp. 77–89.&lt;/ref&gt; He and the psychologists who work within this [[paradigm]] detailed how the world could be specified to a mobile, exploring organism via the lawful projection of information about the world into energy arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sokolowski|first=Robert|title=Phenomenology of the Human Person|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521717663|pages=199–200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NIEJt5afhwgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925011659/https://books.google.com/books?id=NIEJt5afhwgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=25 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Specification" would be a 1:1 mapping of some aspect of the world into a perceptual array; given such a mapping, no enrichment is required and perception is [[direct perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Robert J.|title=James Gibson's Passive Theory of Perception: A Rejection of the Doctrine of Specific Nerve Energies|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=December 1976|volume=37|issue=2|pages=218–233|url=http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/richards/James%20Gibson's%20Passive%20Theory%20of%20Perception.pdf|doi=10.2307/2107193|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613180128/http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/richards/James%20Gibson's%20Passive%20Theory%20of%20Perception.pdf|archivedate=13 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception-in-action===
An ecological understanding of perception derived from Gibson's early work is that of "perception-in-action", the notion that perception is a requisite property of animate action; that without perception, action would be unguided, and without action, perception would serve no purpose. Animate actions require both perception and motion, and perception and movement can be described as "two sides of the same coin, the coin is action". Gibson works from the assumption that singular entities, which he calls "invariants", already exist in the real world and that all that the perception process does is to home in upon them. A view known as [[Constructive perception|constructivism]] (held by such philosophers as [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]]) regards the continual adjustment of perception and action to the external input as precisely what constitutes the "entity", which is therefore far from being invariant.&lt;ref&gt;Consciousness in Action, S. L. Hurley, illustrated, Harvard University Press, 2002, 0674007964, pp. 430–432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glasersfeld considers an "invariant" as a target to be homed in upon, and a pragmatic necessity to allow an initial measure of understanding to be established prior to the updating that a statement aims to achieve. The invariant does not and need not represent an actuality, and Glasersfeld describes it as extremely unlikely that what is desired or [[fear processing in the brain|feared]] by an organism will never suffer change as time goes on. This [[social constructionist]] theory thus allows for a needful evolutionary adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;Glasersfeld, Ernst von (1995), ''Radical Constructivism: A Way of Knowing and Learning,'' London: RoutledgeFalmer; Poerksen, Bernhard (ed.) (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8-_EsHHxHYcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Certainty of Uncertainty: Dialogues Introducing Constructivism],'' Exeter: Imprint Academic; Wright. Edmond (2005). ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke: [[Palgrave Macmillan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A mathematical theory of perception-in-action has been devised and investigated in many forms of controlled movement, and has been described in many different species of organism using the [[General Tau Theory]]. According to this theory, tau information, or time-to-goal information is the fundamental 'percept' in perception.

===Evolutionary psychology (EP) and perception===
Many philosophers, such as Jerry Fodor, write that the purpose of perception is knowledge, but evolutionary psychologists hold that its primary purpose is to guide action.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; For example, they say, depth perception seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in space.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists say that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J.

Building and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive, so these organs evolve only when they improve an organism's fitness.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources, so the senses must provide exceptional benefits to fitness.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Perception accurately mirrors the world; animals get useful, accurate information through their senses.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt;

Scientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Sound waves provide useful information about the sources of and distances to objects, with larger animals making and hearing lower-frequency sounds and smaller animals making and hearing higher-frequency sounds.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that were significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists claim that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain suffer from the specific defect of not being able to recognize faces (prospagnosia).&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; EP suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt;

==Physiology==
{{main article|Sensory system}}
A ''sensory system'' is a part of the nervous system responsible for processing [[sense|sensory]] information. A sensory system consists of [[sensory receptor]]s, [[neural pathway]]s, and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception. Commonly recognized sensory systems are those for [[vision (sense)|vision]], [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[somatic sensation]] (touch), [[taste]] and [[olfaction]] (smell). It has been suggested that the immune system is an overlooked sensory modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bedford|first=F. L. | year = 2011 | title = The missing sensory modality: the immune system | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 40 | issue = 10| pages = 1265–1267 | doi = 10.1068/p7119|pmid=22308900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, senses are [[transducers]] from the physical world to the realm of the mind.

The [[receptive field]] is the specific part of the world to which a receptor organ and receptor cells respond. For instance, the part of the world an eye can see, is its receptive field; the light that each [[Rod cell|rod]] or [[Cone cell|cone]] can see, is its receptive field.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb &amp; Whishaw: ''Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Receptive fields have been identified for the [[visual system]], [[auditory system]] and [[somatosensory system]], so far.
Research attention is currently focused not only on external perception processes, but also to "Interoception", considered as the process of receiving, accessing and appraising internal bodily signals. Maintaining desired physiological states is critical for an organism’s well being and survival. Interoception is an iterative process, requiring the interplay between perception of body states and awareness of these states to generate proper self-regulation. Afferent sensory signals continuously interact with higher order cognitive representations of goals, history, and environment, shaping emotional experience and motivating regulatory behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Farb N. |author2=Daubenmier J. |author3=Price C.

==Types==

===Vision===
{{main article|Visual perception}}

In many ways, vision is the primary human sense. Light is taken in through each eye and focused in a way which sorts it on the retina according to direction of origin. A dense surface of photosensitive cells, including rods, cones, and [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells]] captures information about the intensity, color, and position of incoming light. Some processing of texture and movement occurs within the neurons on the retina before the information is sent to the brain. In total, about 15 differing types of information are then forwarded to the brain proper via the optic nerve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Eye Smarter than Scientists Believed: Neural Computations in Circuits of the Retina | first1=Tim|last1=Gollisch|first2=Markus|last2=Meister | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages=150–164 | date= 28 January 2010 | journal = Neuron | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.12.009| pmid=20152123| pmc=3717333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound===
[[File:Anatomy of the Human Ear en.svg|thumb|right|Anatomy of the human ear. (The length of the auditory canal is exaggerated in this image)]]
{{main article|Hearing (sense)}}
Hearing (or ''audition'') is the ability to perceive [[sound]] by detecting [[vibration]]s. Frequencies capable of being heard by humans are called [[Audio frequency|audio]] or ''sonic''. The range is typically considered to be between 20&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml | title = Frequency Range of Human Hearing | work = The Physics Factbook | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090921163910/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml | archivedate = 21 September 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequencies higher than audio are referred to as [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]], while frequencies below audio are referred to as [[infrasound|infrasonic]]. The [[auditory system]] includes the [[ear|outer ears]] which collect and filter sound waves, the [[ear|middle ear]] for transforming the sound pressure ([[impedance matching]]), and the [[ear|inner ear]] which produces neural signals in response to the sound. By the ascending [[auditory pathway]] these are led to the [[primary auditory cortex]] within the [[temporal lobe]] of the human brain, which is where the auditory information arrives in the [[cerebral cortex]] and is further processed there.

Sound does not usually come from a single source: in real situations, sounds from multiple sources and directions are superimposed as they arrive at the ears. Hearing involves the computationally complex task of separating out the sources of interest, often estimating their distance and direction as well as identifying them.&lt;ref name="eop_constancy" /&gt;

===Touch===
{{main article|Haptic perception}}

''Haptic perception'' is the process of recognizing objects through touch. It involves a combination of [[somatosensory]] perception of patterns on the skin surface (e.g., edges, curvature, and texture) and [[proprioception]] of hand position and conformation. People can rapidly and accurately identify three-dimensional objects by touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klatzky|first1=R. L.|last2=Lederman|first2=S. J.|last3=Metzger|first3=V. A. |year=1985 |title=Identifying objects by touch: An "expert system." |journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics |issue = 4 |pages=299–302 |doi=10.3758/BF03211351 |volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involves exploratory procedures, such as moving the fingers over the outer surface of the object or holding the entire object in the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lederman|first1=S. J.|last2=Klatzky|first2=R. L. |year=1987 |title=Hand movements: A window into haptic object recognition |journal=Cognitive Psychology |issue=3 |pages=342–368 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(87)90008-9 |volume=19 |pmid=3608405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haptic perception relies on the forces experienced during touch.&lt;ref name=Robles-de-la-torre2001&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Robles-de-la-torre | first1 = Gabriel | last2 = Hayward | first2 = Vincent | year = 2001 | title = Force can overcome object geometry in the perception of shape through active touch | journal = Nature | pmid = 11473320 | volume = 412 | issue = 6845 | pages = 445–448 | doi = 10.1038/35086588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson defined the haptic system as "The sensibility of the individual to the world adjacent to his body by use of his body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=J.J. |year=1966 |title=The senses considered as perceptual systems. |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0-313-23961-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson and others emphasized the close link between haptic perception and body movement: haptic perception is active exploration. The concept of haptic perception is related to the concept of [[extended physiological proprioception]] according to which, when using a tool such as a stick, perceptual experience is transparently transferred to the end of the tool.

===Taste===
{{main article|Taste}}

Taste (or, the more formal term, ''gustation'') is the ability to perceive the [[flavor]] of substances including, but not limited to, [[food]]. Humans receive tastes through sensory organs called ''[[taste bud]]s'', or ''gustatory calyculi'', concentrated on the upper surface of the [[tongue]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dNhFLnc6NRkC&amp;lpg=PA201 Human biology (Page 201/464)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102150409/https://books.google.com/books?id=dNhFLnc6NRkC&amp;lpg=PA201 |date=2 January 2017 }} Daniel D.

''Social perception'' is the part of perception that allows people to understand the individuals and groups of their social world, and thus an element of [[social cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith, D. M. Mackie (2000). ''Social Psychology''. Psychology Press, 2nd ed., p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speech====
{{main article|Speech perception}}
[[File:Spectrogram of I owe you.png|right|thumb|Though the phrase "I owe you" can be heard as three distinct words, a [[spectrogram]] reveals no clear boundaries.]]
''Speech perception'' is the process by which spoken languages are heard, interpreted and understood. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how human listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand spoken language. The sound of a word can vary widely according to words around it and the tempo of the speech, as well as the physical characteristics, [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] and mood of the speaker. Listeners manage to perceive words across this wide range of different conditions. Another variation is that [[reverberation]] can make a large difference in sound between a word spoken from the far side of a room and the same word spoken up close. Experiments have shown that people automatically compensate for this effect when hearing speech.&lt;ref name="eop_constancy"&gt;{{cite book|first=Brian C.

The process of perceiving speech begins at the level of the sound within the auditory signal and the process of [[Hearing (sense)|audition]]. The initial auditory signal is compared with visual information — primarily lip movement — to extract acoustic cues and phonetic information. It is possible other sensory modalities are integrated at this stage as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Lawrence D.|last=Rosenblum | editor1-first=David|editor1-last=Pisoni|editor2-first=Robert|editor2-last=Remez | chapter = Primacy of Multimodal Speech Perception | page = 51 | title = The Handbook of Speech Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=EwY15naRiFgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=%22Primacy+of+Multimodal+Speech+Perception%22&amp;ots=0OZ7x69V2R&amp;sig=EqQJlEfphDzrJA32aI1DD4Ku50I#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Primacy%20of%20Multimodal%20Speech%20Perception%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This speech information can then be used for higher-level language processes, such as word recognition.

Speech perception is not necessarily uni-directional. That is, higher-level language processes connected with [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], or [[semantics]] may interact with basic speech perception processes to aid in recognition of speech sounds.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} It may be the case that it is not necessary and maybe even not possible for a listener to recognize phonemes before recognizing higher units, like words for example. In one experiment, Richard M. Warren replaced one phoneme of a word with a cough-like sound. His subjects restored the missing speech sound perceptually without any difficulty and what is more, they were not able to identify accurately which phoneme had been disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren|first=R. M. |year=1970 |title=Restoration of missing speech sounds |journal=Science |volume=167 |pages=392–393 |doi=10.1126/science.167.3917.392 |pmid=5409744 |issue=3917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Faces====
{{main article|Face perception}}
''Facial perception'' refers to cognitive processes specialized for handling human faces, including perceiving the identity of an individual, and facial expressions such as emotional cues.

====Social touch====
{{main article | Somatosensory system#Neural processing of social touch}}
The somatosensory cortex encodes incoming sensory information from receptors all over the body. [[Affective touch]] is a type of sensory information that elicits an emotional reaction and is usually social in nature, such as a physical human touch. This type of information is actually coded differently than other sensory information. Intensity of affective touch is still encoded in the primary somatosensory cortex, but the feeling of pleasantness associated with affective touch activates the anterior cingulate cortex more than the primary somatosensory cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data shows that increased blood oxygen level contrast (BOLD) signal in the anterior cingulate cortex as well as the prefrontal cortex is highly correlated with pleasantness scores of an affective touch. Inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex inhibits the perception of affective touch intensity, but not affective touch pleasantness. Therefore, the S1 is not directly involved in processing socially affective touch pleasantness, but still plays a role in discriminating touch location and intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27225773 | doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1130-15.2016 | pmc=4879201 | volume=36 | title=Encoding of Touch Intensity But Not Pleasantness in Human Primary Somatosensory Cortex | journal=J Neurosci | pages=5850–60 | last1 = Case | first1 = LK | last2 = Laubacher | first2 = CM | last3 = Olausson | first3 = H | last4 = Wang | first4 = B | last5 = Spagnolo | first5 = PA | last6 = Bushnell | first6 = MC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other senses===
{{main article|Sense}}
Other senses enable perception of body balance, acceleration, gravity, position of body parts, temperature, pain, time, and perception of internal senses such as suffocation, gag reflex, intestinal distension, fullness of rectum and urinary bladder, and sensations felt in the throat and lungs.

'''[[Persian Empire|Persian]]-[[Sassanide]] art patterns''' have similarities with the art of the [[Bulgars]], [[Khazars]], and Saka-[[Scythians]], and have recurred in Asia. They predominantly feature motifs of fighting animals. Gold was frequently used as a base for their art creations.

== Patterns ==
The characteristic patterns of [[Empire|Persian]]-[[Sassanide]] art exhibit similarities to the art of the [[Bulgars]],&lt;ref&gt;Bulgarian's Treasures from the past by Ivan Venedikov, Sava Boyadjiev and Dimiter Kartalev, Foreign Languages Press Sofia 1965, pp. 345-55&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khazars]], and Saka-[[Scythian]], and have recurred at different locations in the [[Central Asia]] region. A "[[griffin]] fighting an [[elk]]" motif from the [[Treasure of Nagyszentmiklós]], found in 1799 in what is today [[Romania]], bears similarities with another griffin &amp; elk motif discovered in the tombs of [[Hsiung-nu]]&lt;ref&gt;The Empire of the Steppes, a History of Central Asia by Rene Grousset (transl. by Naomi Walford), Rutgers University Press, 2005, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; (early [[Huns]], also [[Xiongnu]]) during Colonel [[Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov]]&lt;ref&gt;Buddha: Radiant Awakening by Jackie Menzies, Sydney, Art Gallery of New South Wales, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wildlife of the Tibetan Steppe by George B. Schaller, University Of Chicago Press, 2000, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; expedition (1907–09) near [[Ulan Bator|Urga]] (Outer [[Mongolia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Discoveries of the Kozlov Expedition by W. Perceval Yetts, he Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 48, No. 277 (Apr., 1926), pp. 168-185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Pazirik Burial of Altai by Eugene A. Golomshtok, M. P. Griaznov in American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 37, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1933), pp. 30-45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Recent Russian Archaeological Exploration by W. E. D. Allen in The Geographical Journal, Vol. 69, No. 3 (Mar., 1927), pp. 262-264&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[gold]] symbolization of "animals-in-fight" has been also found in the vicinity of the city of [[Turpan]],&lt;ref&gt;The Old Silk Road - From Xi'an to Pamir, Chapter XIII: A Tour of Turpan by Bi Yading, Chinese Intercontinental Press (CIP) 2003, p.121 ({{ISBN|7-5032-2125-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; the principal crossroad of the northern [[Silk Road]]. [[Gold]]en "animals-in-fight" have also been identified as 3rd – 2nd century B.C. [[Mongolia]] (or southern [[Siberia]]), being characteristic of [[Hsiung-nu]] or [[Xiongnu]].

==The Art of the Nomads==

The early history of the [[Nomads]] is not well recorded, which changed after their contact with cultures possessing written history. [[Nomadic people]] of the vast steppes of [[Asia]] were a major force in history.&lt;ref&gt;The Perilous Frontier by Thomas J. Barfield, lackwell Publishers, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Their power was not in the empires they built, but rather the turmoil they created among [[ancient civilizations]] such as [[China]] or [[Persia]], impacting their historical development substantially.&lt;ref&gt;Warriors of the Steppe by Erik Hildinger, De Capo Press, 1997, pp. 57-92&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the [[nomads]] ranged widely, forever moving on for sake of richer grazing for their horses and sheep.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[Nomad|Migrations]] were often seasonal. Their skill at extracting [[gold]] was unprecedented.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In summer, during the tribe's seasonal migration, a [[Wool|fleece]] would be weighted on a riverbed to collect particles of [[alluvial]] [[gold]]. Upon the tribes' return, the [[Wool|fleece]] would be sheared, burned, and a [[gold]] ingot the size of a horse's hoof would result.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The ''tay tayak'' (the horse's hoof) was a unit of gold for a long period, which was used as a measure of an amount of golden metal rather than money, since gold was not fabricated as currency.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Using gold was a spiritual practice, as emblems of priestly office, prizes for physical prowess in ritual sport, or as adornment of the sacral ceremony of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Kazakhstan, Coming of Age by Michael Fergus and Janar Jandosova, Stacey International 2003, p.106 ({{ISBN|1-900988-615}})&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2794">'''"Professional studies"''' is a term used to classify academic programs which are applied or interdisciplinary in focus. The term can also be used for non-academic training for a specific [[profession]].

Professional studies usually combine theory and [[practice-based professional learning]], focusing on a [[body of knowledge]] that is more strictly delineated and [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]ical than non-professional studies. Students are trained to ensure expected [[Standard of care|standards]] and adequate service delivery in the [[best practice]] of a profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-professional-studies.html| title=First-Professional Studies| accessdate=2007-04-25| author=US Department of Education| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214142648/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-professional-studies.html| archivedate=2007-12-14| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional studies may lead to [[academic degrees]] such as the Bachelor of Professional Studies (BPS), [[Master of Professional Studies]] (MPS), or [[Doctor of Professional Studies]] (DPS). A BPS is similar to a [[Bachelor of General Studies]] with a greater emphasis on practical and technical training (and a corresponding lower emphasis on [[liberal arts]]), and therefore of greater interest to mid-career students.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} MPS degrees are usually course-based with a report or project component rather than a research [[thesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-masters-degree.html| title=Master's Degrees Programs| accessdate=2007-04-25| author=US Department of Education |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070219224943/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-masters-degree.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US National Science Foundation]] considers a DPS to be equivalent to a [[PhD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-research-doctorate.html| title=Research Doctorate Programs| accessdate=2007-04-25| author=US Department of Education |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070303214708/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-research-doctorate.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radical evil''' ({{lang-de|das radikal Böse}}) is a phrase used by German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in ''[[Religion within the Bounds of Reason Alone]]'' (1793), one representing the Christian term, radix malorum.

There Kant writes:

{{quote|The depravity of human nature, then, is not so much to be called badness, if this word is taken in its strict sense, namely, as a disposition (subjective principle of maxims) to adopt the bad, as bad, into one’s maxims as a spring (for that is devilish); but rather perversity of heart, which, on account of the result, is also called a bad heart. This may co-exist with a Will [“Wille”] good in general, and arises from the frailty of human nature, which is not strong enough to follow its adopted principles, combined with its impurity in not distinguishing the springs (even of well-intentioned actions) from one another by moral rule. So that ultimately it looks at best only to the conformity of its actions with the law, not to their derivation from it, that is, to the law itself as the only spring. Now although this does not always give rise to wrong actions and a propensity thereto, that is, to vice, yet the habit of regarding the absence of vice as a conformity of the mind to the law of duty (as virtue) must itself be designated a radical perversity of the human heart (since in this case the spring in the maxims is not regarded at all, but only the obedience to the letter of the law).

'''Repatriation''' is the process of returning an asset, an item of symbolic value or a person{{snd}}voluntarily or forcibly{{snd}}to its owner or their place of origin or citizenship. The term may refer to non-human entities, such as converting a foreign currency into the currency of one's own country, as well as to the process of returning [[military personnel]] to their place of origin following a [[war]]. It also applies to diplomatic envoys, international officials as well as [[expatriates]] and [[Human migration|migrants]] in time of international crisis. For [[refugees]], [[asylum seekers]] and [[Illegal immigration|illegal migrants]], repatriation can mean either [[voluntary return]] or [[deportation]].

==Repatriation of humans==

===Overview and clarification of terms===

====Voluntary return vs. forced return====
[[Voluntary return]] is the return of eligible persons, such as refugees, to their [[country of origin]] or citizenship on the basis of freely expressed willingness to such return. Voluntary return, unlike expulsion and deportation, which are actions of sovereign states, is defined as a personal right under specific conditions described in various international instruments, such as the [[OAU Convention]], along with customary international law.

Some countries offer financial support to refugees and immigrants in order to facilitate the process of starting a new life in their country of origin. Examples of 21st century voluntary return include the Danish government, which began in 2009, offering £12,000 each to immigrants to return,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/6533845/Denmark-offers-immigrants-12000-to-return-home.html "Denmark offers immigrants £12,000 to return home"], The Telegraph. November 10, 2009. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland offering around 6,500 Francs, targeted for business startups upon returning home,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nigeriaworld.com/feature/publication/ubochi/112809.html "Switzerland and Nigerians Abroad"], Temple Chima Ubochi. ''Nigeria World''. November 28, 2009. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; as well Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/15/ireland-pay-immigrants-go-home "Irish government to pay immigrants to go home"], Henry McDonald. ''The Guardian''. November 14, 2009. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Germany in 2016 allocated €150 million over three years for migrants willing to return,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.eu/article/germany-to-pay-for-migrants-to-go-home-gerd-muller/ "Germany to pay for migrants to go home"], Cynthia Kroet. Politico EU. December 9, 2016. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and the Swedish government began offering £3,500 each.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.onenewsnow.com/culture/2016/08/29/thousands-of-migrants-paid-by-swedish-govt-to-leave "Thousands of migrants paid by Swedish gov't to leave"], Michael F. Haverluck. One News Now. August 29, 2016. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 544 Nigerians returned home from Switzerland in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/directdemocracy/returning-asylum-seekers_a-fresh-start-in-nigeria--brought-to-you-by-switzerland/38687662 "A fresh start in Nigeria, brought to you by Switzerland"], Veronica DeVore. Swiss Info. June 6, 2014. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; This financial support may also be considered as residency buyouts.

Two countries may have a re-admission agreement, which establishes procedures, on a reciprocal basis, for one state to return irregular non-nationals to their country of origin or a country through which they have transited.&lt;ref name="Perruchoud 2011"/&gt; [[Illegal immigrant]]s are frequently repatriated as a matter of government policy. Repatriation measures of [[voluntary return]], with financial assistance, as well as measures of [[deportation]] are used in many countries.

As repatriation can be voluntary or forced the term is also used as a euphemism for deportation. Involuntary or forced repatriation is the return of refugees, prisoners of war, or civil detainees to their country of origin under circumstances that leave no other viable alternatives. According to contemporary international law, prisoners of war, civil detainees, or refugees refusing repatriation, particularly if motivated by fears of political persecution in their own country, should be protected from [[refoulement]] and given, if possible, temporary or permanent [[Political asylum|asylum]].&lt;ref name="Perruchoud 2011"&gt;Perruchoud, Richard and Jillyanne Redpath-Cross (eds.), Glossary on Migration, Second Edition, International Organisation for Migration, International Migration Law, No. 25, Geneva, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The forced return of people to countries where they would face persecution is more specifically known as [[refoulement]], which is against international law.

====Repatriation vs. return====
While repatriation necessarily brings an individual to his or her territory of origin or citizenship, a return potentially includes bringing the person back to the point of departure. This could be to a third country, including a country of transit, which is a country the person has traveled through to get to the country of destination. A return could also be within the territorial boundaries of a country, as in the case of returning [[internally displaced persons]] and demobilized combatants.

===Types of human repatriation===

====Medical repatriation====
Repatriation is linked with health care due to the costs and resources associated with providing medical treatment to travelers and immigrants pursuing citizenship. For example, if someone is in the United States with a visa and becomes ill, the insurance that the visa holder has in his or her native country may not apply in the United States, especially if it is a country with universal health care coverage. This scenario forces hospitals to choose one of three options:  
* Limit their services to emergency care only (as per the [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]])  
* Offer charity care free of charge or at a reduced rate  
* Repatriate the patient back to his or her native country where he or she will be covered according to that country's policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wack|first=Kevin J.|author2=Toby Schonfeld |title=Patient Autonomy and the  Unfortunate Choice between Repatriation and Suboptimal Treatment|journal=American Journal of Bioethics|year=2012|volume=12|issue=9|pages=6–7|doi=10.1080/15265161.2012.692444}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Determining which option is the most ethical is often very challenging for hospital administrators.

In some cases, a traveler's personal insurance company is required to repatriate the patient for medical treatment. The method of repatriation could be via regular flight, by ground, or by air ambulance. Medical repatriation is different from the act of [[medical evacuation]].

====Post–World War II====
In the 20th century, following all European wars, several repatriation commissions were created to supervise the return of war refugees, [[displaced person]]s, and [[prisoners of war]] to their country of origin. Repatriation [[hospital]]s were established in some countries to care for the ongoing medical and health requirements of returned military personnel. In the [[Soviet Union]], the refugees seen as traitors for surrendering were often killed or sent to [[Siberia]]n concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fields|first1=Paul|title=Ostarbeiters|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/zvezda/2005/6/po8.html|website=Coffee Lounge|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues surrounding repatriation have been some of the most heatedly debated political topics of the 20th and 21st centuries. Many [[Operation Keelhaul|forced back to the Soviet Union by Allied forces]] in [[World War II]] still hold this forced migration against the [[United States of America]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

The term ''repatriation'' was often used by Communist governments to describe the large-scale state-sponsored [[ethnic cleansing]] actions and [[Population transfer|expulsion]] of national groups. [[Poland|Poles]] born in territories that were annexed by the Soviet Union,  although deported to the State of Poland, were settled in the annexed former [[Germany|German]] territories (referred to in Polish as the [[Regained Territories]]). In the process they were told that they had returned to their Motherland.

====Battlefield casualties====
The [[Korean War]] marked the first time that the United States or any nation began returning the bodies of battlefield casualties as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=Sledge&gt;{{cite book |last=Sledge |first=Michael |title=Soldier Dead: How We Recover, Identify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen |orig-year=First published 2005 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780231509374 |pages=78–80 |oclc= 60527603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Operation Glory]], which followed the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]], thousands of remains were exchanged by both sides.&lt;ref name=Sledge /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not all remains from the Korean War were returned to the home countries. Some 2,300 casualties are buried at the [[United Nations Memorial Cemetery]] in [[Busan, South Korea]].&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of immediately recovering casualties continued for United States during the [[Vietnam War casualties|Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=Sledge /&gt;

===Repatriation laws===
{{See also|Right of Return}}
Repatriation laws give non-citizen foreigners who are part of the titular [[Ethnic majority|majority group]] the opportunity to immigrate and receive [[citizenship]]. Repatriation of their titular diaspora is practiced by most [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic nation]] states. Repatriation laws have been created in many countries to enable [[diaspora]]s to immigrate ("return") to their "kin-state". This is sometimes known as the exercise of the [[right of return]]. Repatriation laws give members of the diaspora the right to immigrate to their kin-state and they serve to maintain close ties between the state and its diaspora and gives preferential treatment to diaspora immigrants.

Most countries in central and eastern Europe as well as [[Armenia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Spain]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Turkey]] have longstanding repatriation legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/YakobsonRubinstein2005.pdf|title=Democratic Norms, Diasporas, and Israel’s Law of Return|last2=Rubinstein|first2=Amnon|authorlink2=Amnon Rubinstein|format=PDF|first1=Alexander|last1=Yakobson|authorlink1=Alexander Yakobson|work=ajc.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126182841/http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/YakobsonRubinstein2005.pdf|archivedate=2010-11-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Norway]] and [[Serbia]] also have repatriation laws for their diaspora populations. The number of countries with repatriation laws has mushroomed since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|end of Soviet communism]] and most independent nations that were [[Post-Soviet states|once part of the communist domain]] in [[Europe]] have since legislated repatriation laws. Many other countries such as [[Jordan]] and [[Sweden]] have (or have had) generous immigration policies with regard to the nation's [[diaspora]] without having formally enacted repatriation laws. Such states can be described as practicing ''common law repatriation''.

In comparison, one of the central tenets of the [[Rastafari movement]] is the desirability of the repatriation of [[black people]] from the [[Americas]] and elsewhere back to [[Africa]]. While [[Ethiopia]] specifically has land available in [[Shashamane]] to encourage this project, black people who are citizens of countries outside Africa do not have the [[right of return]] to Africa, although as individuals they are free to try to [[emigration|emigrate]].

===Psychological aspects===
Repatriation is often the "forgotten" phase of the [[expatriation]] cycle; the emphasis for support is mostly on the actual period abroad.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} However, many repatriates report experiencing difficulties on return: one is no longer special, practical problems arise, new knowledge gained is no longer useful, etc. These difficulties are highly influenced by a number of factors including [[Personal development|self-management]], [[Marriage|spouse's]] adjustment, time spent abroad and skill utilisation. What is crucial is that every individual perceives these factors in a different way. Reintegration is a process of re-inclusion or re-incorporation of a person into a group or a process, and may contribute to overcoming repatriation.&lt;ref name="Perruchoud 2011"/&gt;

Direct managers and [[Human resources|HR]] staff often notice the difficulties a repatriate experiences, but they are not always able to act on it. Budget shortcomings and time constraints are frequently cited as reasons why it fails to be an agenda priority. Solutions for repatriation difficulties do not have to be expensive and can lead to great benefits for the company.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Basic support can consist, for example, of good communication in advance, during and after the international assignment, or a mentor program to assist the repatriate. The expatriate and his/her family should feel understood by his or her company. Support can increase job satisfaction, thereby protecting the investment made by the company.&lt;ref&gt;Ripmeester, N. “Handle with care”, ''Graduate Recruiter'', Issue 22 (February) 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repatriation of non-human entities==

===Human remains===
[[Repatriation and reburial of human remains|Return of human remains]] to their nation of origin. In the United States, Native Americans' human remains are uncovered and removed from their burial sites in the construction/land development process or as part of archaeological excavations. The [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA) of 1990 established the process whereby federally recognized Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations can request that federal agencies and institutions receiving federal funds return culturally affiliated human remains.  The NAGPRA also sets forth provisions that allow for the disposition of Native American human remains found on federal lands to the affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization.  NAGPRA does not apply to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], which is covered under the repatriation provisions of the [[National Museum of the American Indian Act]] of 1989. In previous eras it was common for [[United Kingdom|British]] [[colony|colonial]] authorities to collect heads and other body parts of indigenous peoples such as [[Indigenous Australians]] and [[Māori people|Māori]] for display in British museums. The repatriation of these body parts is currently ongoing.  For an example of a successful body part repatriation, see [[Yagan]]. Another example can be seen through the dedicated work of the Karanga Aotearoa Repatriation Programme, established in partnership between Māori and the New Zealand government in 2003.  This programme is administered by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa), and since 2003 has repatriated over 350 Māori and Moriori ancestral remains to Aotearoa New Zealand. Article 12 of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] affirms that indigenous peoples have the right to repatriate their human remains. The declaration was passed in September 2007 with the support of 143 countries. The four opposing countries—Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States—subsequently endorsed the declaration.

=== Cultural artifacts===
Cultural or [[art repatriation]] is the return of cultural objects or works of art to their country of origin (usually referring to ancient art), or (for looted material) its former owners (or their heirs).

=== Economic repatriation===
Economic repatriation refers to economic measures taken by a country to reduce foreign capital investment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Repatriation of currency===
Repatriation of currency is when foreign currency is converted back to the currency of the home country. An example would be an American converting British pounds back to U.S. dollars. Repatriation also refers to the payment of a dividend by a foreign corporation to a U.S. corporation. This happens often where the foreign corporation is considered a "controlled foreign corporation" (CFC), which means that more than 50% of the foreign corporation is owned by U.S. shareholders. Generally, foreign direct investment in CFC's are not taxed until a dividend is paid to the controlling U.S. parent company, and is thus repatriated. The foreign direct investment income of the CFC is taxed only by the country where it is incorporated until repatriation. At that time, income is subject to the (typically higher) U.S. tax rate minus the Foreign Tax Credits. (FN: See IRC 951-965) There are currently hundreds of billions of dollars of Foreign direct investment in CFC's because of the disincentive to repatriate those earnings.

The '''Royal Meteorological Society''' is a long-established institution that promotes academic and public engagement in weather and climate science. Fellows of the Society must possess relevant qualifications, but Associate Fellows can be lay enthusiasts. Its Quarterly Journal is one of the world's leading sources of original research in the atmospheric sciences.

==Constitution==
The Royal Meteorological Society traces its origins back to 3 April 1850 when the British Meteorological Society was formed as "a society the objects of which should be the advancement and extension of meteorological science by determining the laws of climate and of meteorological phenomena in general". Along with nine others, including [[James Glaisher]], [[John Drew (astronomer)|John Drew]], [[Edward Joseph Lowe]], [[Joseph Bancroft Reade|The Revd Joseph Bancroft Reade]], and [[Samuel Charles Whitbread]], [[John Lee (astronomer)|Dr John Lee]], an astronomer, of [[Hartwell House, Buckinghamshire|Hartwell House]], near [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire founded in the library of his house the British Meteorological Society, which became the Royal Meteorological Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmets.org/pdf/metsocearlymembers.pdf Early members of the society] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120804104539/http://www.rmets.org/pdf/metsocearlymembers.pdf |date=4 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became The Meteorological Society in 1866, when it was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]], and the Royal Meteorological Society in 1883, when Her Majesty [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] granted the privilege of adding 'Royal' to the title. Along with 74 others, the famous meteorologist [[Luke Howard]] joined the original 15 members of the Society at its first ordinary meeting on 7 May 1850. As of 2008 it has more than 3,000 members worldwide. The chief executive of the Society is Professor Liz Bentley.

== Membership ==
There are four different membership categories:
* Honorary Fellow
* Fellow ('''FRMetS''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Abbreviations|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Associate Fellow
* Corporate member

==Awards==
The society regularly awards a number of medal and prizes, of which the [[Symons Gold Medal]] (established in 1901) and the Mason Gold Medal (established in 2006) are pre-eminent. The two medals are awarded alternately.

Other awards include the Buchan Prize, the Hugh Robert Mill Award, the L F Richardson Prize, the Michael Hunt Award, the Fitzroy Prize, the Gordon Manley Weather Prize, the International Journal of Climatology Prize, the Society Outstanding Service Award and the Vaisala Award.[http://www.rmets.org/our-activities/awards/details-our-awards]

== Journals ==
The society has a number of regular publications:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rmets.org/publications/journals&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Atmospheric Science Letters]]'': amonthly magazine that provides a peer reviewed publication route for new shorter contributions in the field of atmospheric and closely related sciences.
* ''[[Weather (journal)|Weather]]'': a monthly magazine with many full colour illustrations and photos for specialists and general readers with an interest in meteorology. It uses a minimum of mathematics and technical language.
* ''[[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society]]'': as one of the world's leading journals for meteorology publishes original research in the atmospheric sciences. There are eight issues per year.
* ''[[Meteorological Applications]]'': this is a journal for applied meteorologists, forecasters and users of meteorological services and has been published since 1994. It is aimed at a general readership and authors are asked to take this into account when preparing papers.
* ''[[International Journal of Climatology]]'': has 15 issues a year and covers a broad spectrum of research in climatology.
* ''[[Atmospheric Science Letters]]'': an electronic only publication for short communication.
* ''[[WIREs Climate Change]]'': a journal about climate change
* ''[[Geoscience Data Journal]]'': an online, open-access journal.
All publications are available online but a subscription is required for some. However certain "classic" papers are freely available on the Society's website.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rmets.org/publications/classic-papers&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local Centres and Special Interest Groups ==
The society has several Local Centres across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmets.org/about-us/local-centres Local Centres]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of Special Interest Groups which organise meetings and other activities to facilitate exchange of information and views within specific areas of meteorology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmets.org/about-us/special-interest-groups Special Interest Groups]&lt;/ref&gt; These are informal groups of professionals interested in specific technical areas of the profession of meteorology. The groups are primarily a way of communicating at a specialist level.

'''Saint Thomas Christian music''' refers to the [[music]]al traditions of the [[Saint Thomas Christian]] community of [[Kerala]], [[India]]. It is chiefly [[liturgical music|liturgical]] and is derived from ancient [[Syriac Christian]] music from the [[Middle East]], with remarkably little influence from local Indian styles. Of particular significance is the prevalence of the [[organum]] singing style. As a result of the community's isolation and conservatism, these traditions may retain elements of the earliest forms of [[Early Christian music]].

==History==
The [[Saint Thomas Christians]] trace their origins to the evangelical activity of [[Thomas the Apostle]] in the 1st century. The community grew under the influence of migration from Syrians, members of the [[Church of the East]]. The community's modern musical traditions may be derived from this connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 83–85|publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Into the 20th century, Saint Thomas Christian liturgy was performed and sung in the [[Syriac language]], though today this largely has been replaced with the local language, [[Malayalam]].&lt;ref name=Ross85&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |page= 85|publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the community's resistance to outside influence and isolation, the music of the Saint Thomas Christians may preserve elements of the earliest forms of Christian music.&lt;ref name=Ross80&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |page= 80 |publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Israel G. Ross compares Saint Thomas Christian music to that of the [[Jews]] in Kerala. [[Jewish music]] influenced the early Christian music ancestral to the Saint Thomas Christian forms, and Jews have lived in similar conditions to the Thomas Christians in [[Kerala]] for centuries.&lt;ref name=Ross80/&gt; As such, Christian and Jewish music and culture in Kerala feature many parallels and similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 80–81 |publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a Saint Thomas Christian blessing given by a dying father to his children is similar to the Jewish [[Amidah]].&lt;ref name=Ross85&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |page= 82|publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt; These similarities may reflect a common origin in the ancient Middle East.&lt;ref name=Ross88&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 88 |publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Saint Thomas Christian music derives from archaic Syriac forms, with little discernible influence from [[Indian classical music]] or other local traditions.&lt;ref name=Ross80/&gt; [[Liturgical music]] is performed in two [[mode (music)|modes]]: ''kadmoyo'' and ''hamisoyo''. These are similar to the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[maqama]]t'' and may be derived from an ancient [[Syriac sacral music|Syriac system]] that existed in the Middle East in the early centuries of Christianity, and which may be related to the system known as [[oktoechos]].&lt;ref name=Ross85/&gt; Intonation is similar to the Syriac standard, featuring no [[augmented second]] or [[microtonal]] alteration characteristic of Indian music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 86 |publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[organum]] singing style is common in Saint Thomas Christian music. It appears in [[antiphons]], [[responsory|responsories]], and [[hymn]]s. Ross notes that this is found among three other disparate and isolated cultures: the nearby [[Cochin Jews]], the [[Yemenite Jews]], and the [[Samaritans]]. Organum may be sung in either duplum or triplum.  In the former it is sung in the [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] when the boys and men sing together with the [[cantus firmus]] in the upper voice, or in the [[perfect fourth|fourth]] when the groups sing alone. In triplum it is sung in the fourth and octave.&lt;ref name=Ross88/&gt;

[[File:CommonOriginJewishandKeralaNasrani.JPG|Similarities in traditional liturgical music of Kerala Jews and Nasranis (Syrian Christians)]]

The [[Margam Kali]] is a traditional Saint Thomas Christian dance. The accompanying music is performed by a choir singing in Syriac chant, with a ''sleeyankolu'' ([[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]) maintaining rhythm. Another traditional instrument is the [[violin]] or ''revekka''.&lt;ref name= Choondal&gt;Chummar Choondal (1983). "Christian folk songs". ''Kerala Folklore Academy'', p 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chant accentuation==
Traditional chant accentuation derives from the Syriac standard, which was instituted by the scholars known as the [[Masoretes]] in the Middle Ages. The form is similar to that codified by the [[Hebrew]] [[Linguist|grammarians]] of [[Tiberias]] for Jewish cantillation of the Bible. It features dot notation above, below, and to the side of words in the text.

'''Science and technology studies''', or '''science, technology and society''' studies (both abbreviated '''STS''') is the study of how society, politics, and culture affect [[scientific research]] and technological [[innovation]], and how these, in turn, affect [[society]], [[politics]] and [[culture]].

==History==
Like most [[interdisciplinary]] programs, STS emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields, all of which had developed an interest—typically, during the 1960s or 1970s—in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Bijker, W. E., Hughes, T. P., Pinch, T. and Douglas, D. G., ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology'', [[MIT Press]], Cambridge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key disciplinary components of STS took shape independently, beginning in the 1960s, and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s, although [[Ludwik Fleck]]'s (1935) monograph ''Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact'' anticipated many of STS's key themes.  In the 1970s [[Elting E. Morison]] founded the STS program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), which served as a model. By 2011, 111 STS research centres and academic programs were counted worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stswiki.org/index.php?title=Worldwide_directory_of_STS_programs The STS Wiki].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key themes===

*[[History of technology]], that examines technology in its social and historical context. Starting in the 1960s, some historians questioned [[technological determinism]], a doctrine that can induce public passivity to technologic and scientific "natural" development.  At the same time, some historians began to develop similarly contextual approaches to the [[history of medicine]].
* [[History and philosophy of science]] (1960s). After the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well-known ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), which attributed changes in scientific theories to changes in underlying intellectual [[paradigm]]s, programs were founded at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and elsewhere that brought [[historians of science]] and philosophers together in unified programs.
*[[Technology and society|Science, technology, and society]]. In the mid- to late-1960s, student and faculty social movements in the U.S., UK, and European universities helped to launch a range of new interdisciplinary fields (such as [[women's studies]]) that were seen to address relevant topics that the traditional curriculum ignored. One such development was the rise of "science, technology, and society" programs, which are also—confusingly—known by the STS acronym. Drawn from a variety of disciplines, including [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]], scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by [[science]] and [[technology]]. Unlike scholars in [[science studies]], history of technology, or the history and philosophy of science, they were and are more likely to see themselves as activists working for change rather than dispassionate, "[[ivory tower]]" researchers{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. As an example of the activist impulse, feminist scholars in this and other emerging STS areas addressed themselves to the exclusion of [[Women in science|women]] from science and engineering.
*Science, engineering, and public [[policy studies]] emerged in the 1970s from the same concerns that motivated the founders of the science, technology, and society movement:  A sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the public's best interests.{{According to whom|date=November 2013}} The science, technology, and society movement tried to humanize those who would make tomorrow's science and technology, but this discipline took a different approach: It would train students with the professional skills needed to become players in science and technology policy. Some programs came to emphasize quantitative methodologies, and most of these were eventually absorbed into [[systems engineering]]. Others emphasized sociological and qualitative approaches, and found that their closest kin could be found among scholars in science, technology, and society departments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

During the 1970s and 1980s, leading universities in the US, UK, and Europe began drawing these various components together in new, interdisciplinary programs. For example, in the 1970s, Cornell University developed a new program that united science studies and policy-oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology. Each of these programs developed unique identities due to variation in the components that were drawn together, as well as their location within the various universities. For example, the University of Virginia's STS program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields (with particular strength in the history of technology); however, the program's teaching responsibilities—it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students—means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in [[engineering ethics]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===The "turn to technology" (and beyond)===
{{see also|Social construction of technology}}

A decisive moment in the development of STS was the mid-1980s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science. During that decade, two works appeared ''en seriatim'' that signaled what [[Steve Woolgar]] was to call the "turn to technology": ''Social Shaping of Technology'' (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1985) and ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems'' (Bijker, Hughes and Pinch, 1987). MacKenzie and [[Judy Wajcman|Wajcman]] primed the pump by publishing a collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design. In a seminal article, [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Wiebe Bijker]] attached all the legitimacy of the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge to this development by showing how the sociology of technology could proceed along precisely the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge. This was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the social construction of technology.

The "turn to technology" helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging STS programs. More recently, there has been an associated turn to ecology, nature, and materiality in general, whereby the socio-technical and natural/material co-produce each other. This is especially evident in work in STS analyses of biomedicine (such as [[Carl May]], [[Annemarie Mol]], Nelly Oudshoorn, and Andrew Webster) and ecological interventions (such as [[Bruno Latour]], [[Sheila Jasanoff]], [[Matthias Gross]], [[S. Lochlann Jain]], and Jens Lachmund).

==Professional associations==
The subject has several professional associations.

Founded in 1975, the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]], initially provided scholarly communication facilities, including a journal (''Science, Technology, and Human Values'') and annual meetings that were mainly attended by science studies scholars. The society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide. The Society for Social Studies of Science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy; scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice; and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives. Proposals have been made to add the word "technology" to the association's name, thereby reflecting its stature as the leading STS professional society, {{According to whom|but there seems to be widespread sentiment|date=November 2013}} that the name is long enough as it is.

In [[Europe]], the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easst.net/ European Association for the Study of Science and Technology].&lt;/ref&gt;  was founded in 1981 to "stimulate communication, exchange and collaboration in the field of studies of science and technology". Similarly, the [[European Inter-University Association on Society, Science and Technology]] (ESST) researches and studies science and technology in society, in both historical and contemporary perspectives.

In Asia several STS associations exist.
In [[Japan]], the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies (JSSTS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://jssts.jp/content/section/14/51/ Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2001. The Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network (APSTSN)&lt;ref&gt;[http://apstsn.org/ Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network]&lt;/ref&gt; primarily has members from Australasia, Southeast and East Asia and Oceania.

In Latin America ESOCITE (Estudios Sociales de la Ciencia y la Tecnología) is the biggest association of Science and Technology studies. The study of STS (CyT in Spanish, CTS in Portuguese) here was shaped by authors like Amílcar Herrera and Jorge Sabato y Oscar Varsavsky in Argentina, José Leite Lopes in Brazil, Miguel Wionczek in Mexico, Francisco Sagasti in Peru, Máximo Halty Carrere in Uruguay and Marcel Roche in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;Kreimer, P. (2007). Estudios sociales de la ciencia y la tecnología en América Latina: ¿para qué?, ¿ para quién? Redes, 13(26), 55–64. Retrieved from http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/907/90702603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1958, the [[Society for the History of Technology]] initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology. After the "turn to technology" in the mid-1980s, the society's well-regarded journal (''Technology and Culture'') and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non-historians with technology studies interests.

Less identified with STS, but also of importance to many STS scholars, are the [[History of Science Society]], the [[Philosophy of Science Association]], and the American Association for the History of Medicine.

Additionally, within the US there are significant STS-oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations, including the [[American Anthropological Association]], the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[National Women's Studies Association]], and the [[American Sociological Association]].

==Important concepts==
=== STS social construction ===
{{Main|Social construction of technology}}

Social constructions are human created ideas, objects, or events created by a series of choices and interactions.&lt;ref name="Science Technology and Society"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodhouse|first1=Edward|title=Science Technology and Society|date=2014|publisher=University Readers|location=San Diego|page=255|edition=1st|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions have consequences that change the perception that different groups of people have on these constructs. Some examples of social construction include class, race, money, and citizenship.

The following also alludes to the notion that not everything is set, a circumstance or result could potentially be one way or the other. According to the article "What is Social Construction?" by Laura Flores, "Social construction work is critical of the status quo. Social constructionists about X tend to hold that:
# X need not have existed, or need not be at all as it is. X, or X as it is at present, is not determined by the nature of things; it is not inevitable
Very often they go further, and urge that:
# X is quite as bad as it is.
# We would be much better off if X were done away with, or at least radically transformed." 
In the past, there have been viewpoints that were widely regarded as fact until being called to question due to the introduction of new knowledge. Such viewpoints include the past concept of a correlation between intelligence and the nature of a human's ethnicity or race (X may not be at all as it is).&lt;ref name="The Social Construction of What"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hacking|first1=Ian|title=The Social Construction of What?|date=1999|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard University|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts &amp; London, England|isbn=978-0674004122|page=6|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the evolution and interaction of various social constructions within science and technology can be found in the development of both the high-wheel bicycle, or [[velocipede]], and then of the [[bicycle]].  The velocipede was widely used in the latter half of the 19th century. In the latter half of the 19th century, a social need was first recognized for a more efficient and rapid means of transportation.  Consequently, the velocipede was first developed, which was able to reach higher translational velocities than the smaller non-geared bicycles of the day, by replacing the front wheel with a larger radius wheel. One notable trade-off was a certain decreased stability leading to a greater risk of falling. This trade-off resulted in many riders getting into accidents by losing balance while riding the bicycle or being thrown over the handle bars.

The first "social construction" or progress of the velocipede caused the need for a newer "social construction" to be recognized and developed into a safer bicycle design.  Consequently, the velocipede was then developed into what is now commonly known as the "[[bicycle]]" to fit within society's newer "social construction," the newer standards of higher vehicle safety. Thus the popularity of the modern geared bicycle design came as a response to the first social construction, the original need for greater speed, which had caused the high-wheel bicycle to be designed in the first place.  The popularity of the modern geared bicycle design ultimately ended the widespread use of the velocipede itself, as eventually it was found to best accomplish the social-needs/ social-constructions of both greater speed and of greater safety.&lt;ref name="MIT Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bijker,|first1=Wiebe|title=The Social Construction of Technological System|date=1993|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-52137-7|pages=28–45|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technoscience ===
{{Main|Technoscience}}

Technoscience is a subset of Science, Technology, and Society studies that focuses on the inseparable connection between science and technology. It states that fields are linked and grow together, and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward. Both technological development and scientific discovery drive one another towards more advancement. Technoscience excels at shaping human thought and behavior by opening up new possibilities that gradually or quickly come to be perceived as necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lukes, Power: A Radical View (London: Macmillan, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technosocial ===
{{split section|Technosocial|date=June 2015}}

"Technological action is a social process."&lt;ref name = "Goldman, 1992"&gt;Goldman, S. (1992). No Innovation Without Representation (pp. 148-160). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt; Social factors and technology are intertwined so that they are dependent upon each other. This includes the aspect that social, political, and economic factors are inherent in technology and that social structure influences what technologies are pursued. In other words, "technoscientific phenomena combined inextricably with social/political/ economic/psychological phenomena, so 'technology' includes a spectrum of artifacts, techniques, organizations, and systems."&lt;ref name = "Woodhouse, 2013"&gt;Woodhouse, E. (2013). In The Future of Technological Civilization (Revised ed., pp. 1-258).&lt;/ref&gt; Winner expands on this idea by saying "in the late twentieth century technology and society, technology and culture, technology and politics are by no means separate."&lt;ref name = "Winner, 1993"&gt;Winner, L. (1993). Artifacts/Ideas and Political Culture (pp. 283-292). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
* Ford Pinto&lt;ref name = "Dowie, 1997"&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1977/09/pinto-madness?page=2 Dowie, M. (1977, October 1). Pinto Madness. Retrieved February 4, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; – Ford Motor Company sold and produced the Pinto during the 1970s. A flaw in the automobile design of the rear gas tank caused a fiery explosion upon impact. The exploding fuel tank killed and injured hundreds of people. Internal documents of test results, proved Ford CEO Lee Iacocca and engineers were aware of the flaw. The company decided to ignore improving their technology because of profit-driven motives, strict internal control, and competition from foreign competitors such as Volkswagen. Ford Motor Company conducted a cost-benefit analysis to determine if altering the Ford Pinto model was feasible. An analysis conducted by Ford employees argued against a new design because of increased cost. Employees were also under tight control by the CEO who rushed the Pinto through production lines to increase profits. Ford finally changed after public scrutiny. Safety organizations later influenced this technology by requiring stricter safety standards for motor vehicles.
* DDT/toxins&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – DDT was a common and highly effective insecticide used during the 1940s until its ban in the early 1970s. It was utilized during World War 2 to combat insect-borne human disease that plagued military members and civilian populations. People and companies soon realized other benefits of DDT for agricultural purposes. Rachel Carson became worried of wide spread use on public health and the environment. Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring'' left an imprint on the industry by claiming linkage of DDT to many serious illness such as cancer. Carson's book drew criticism from chemical companies who felt their reputation and business threatened by such claims.. DDT was eventually banned by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after a long and arduous process of research on the chemical substance. The main cause for the removal of DDT was the public deciding that any benefits outweighed the potential health risk.
* Autopilots/computer aided tasks (CATs)&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – From a security point of view the effects of making a task more computer driven is in the favor of technological advance because there is less reaction time required and computational error than a human pilot. Due to reduced error and reaction times flights on average, using autopilot, have been shown to be safer. Thus the technology has a direct impact on people by increasing their safety, and society affects the technology because people want to be safer so they are constantly trying to improve the autopilot systems.
* Cell phones&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – Cell phone technology emerged in the early 1920s after advancements were made in radio technology. Engineers at Bell Laboratories, the research and development division of AT&amp;T discovered that cell towers can transmit and receive signals to and from many directions. The discovery by Bell Labs revolutionized the capabilities and outcomes of cellular technology. Technology only improved once mobile phone users could communicate outside of a designated area. First generation mobile phones were first created and sold by Motorola. Their phone was only intended for use in cars. Second generation mobile phone capabilities continued to improve because of the switch to digital. Phones were faster which enhanced communication capabilities of customers. They were also sleeker and weighed less than bulky first generation technology. Technologically advances boosted customer satisfaction and broadened cell phone companies customer base. Third generation technology changed the way people interact with other. Now customers had access to wifi, texting and other applications. Mobile phones are now entering into the fourth generations.  Cellular and mobile phones revolutionized the way people socialize and communicate in order to establish modern social structure. People have affected the development of this technology by demanding features such as larger screens, touch capabilities, and internet accessibility.
* Internet&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; –  The internet arose because of extensive research on ARPANET between various university, corporations, and ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency), an agency of the Department of Defense. Scientist theorized a network of computers connected to each other. Computing capabilities contributed to developments and the creation of the modern day computer or laptop. The internet has become a normal part of life and business, to such a degree that the United Nations views it as a basic human right. The internet is becoming larger, one way is that more things are being moved into the digital world due to demand, for example online banking. It has drastically changed the way most people go about daily habits.

===Deliberative democracy===
[[Deliberative democracy]] is a reform of [[representative democracy|representative]] or [[direct democracy|direct]] democracies which mandates discussion and debate of popular topics which affect society.  Deliberative Democracy is a tool for making decisions.  Deliberative democracy can be traced back all the way to [[Aristotle’s writings]]. More recently, the term was coined by Joseph Bessette in his 1980 work ''Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government'', where he uses the idea in opposition to the elitist interpretations of the [[United States Constitution]] with emphasis on public discussion.&lt;ref name="Bohman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohman|first1=James|title=The Coming of Age of Deliberative Democracy|journal=[[The Journal of Political Philosophy]]|date=1998|volume=6|issue=4|pages=400–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberative Democracy can lead to more legitimate, credible, and trustworthy outcomes.  Deliberative Democracy allows for "a wider range of public knowledge," and it has been argued that this can lead to "more socially intelligent and robust" science. One major shortcoming of deliberative democracy is that many models insufficiently ensure critical interaction.&lt;ref name="Chilvers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chilvers|first1=Jason|title=Deliberating Competence, Theoretical and Practitioners Perspectives on Effective Participatory Appraisal Practice|journal=[[Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values]]|date=March 2008|volume=33|issue=2|url=http://sth.sagepub.com|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ryfe, there are five mechanisms that stand out as critical to the successful design of deliberative democracy:
*Rules of equality, civility, and inclusivity may prompt deliberation even when our first impulse is to avoid it.
*Stories anchor reality by organizing experience and instilling a normative commitment to civic identities and values, and function as a medium for framing discussions.
*Leadership provides important cues to individuals in deliberative settings, and can keep groups on a deliberative track when their members slip into routine and habit.
*Individuals are more likely to sustain deliberative reasoning when they have a stake in the outcomes.
*Apprenticeship teaches citizens to deliberate well. We might do well to imagine education as a form of apprenticeship learning, in which individuals learn to deliberate by doing it in concert with others more skilled in the activity.&lt;ref name="Ryfe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryfe|first1=David M.|title=Does Deliberative Democracy Work?|journal=[[Annual Review of Political Science]]|date=March 4, 2005|volume=8|pages=63–64|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Importance of deliberative democracy in STS====
Recently,{{when|date=January 2018}} there has been a movement towards greater transparency in the fields of policy and technology. Jasanoff comes to the conclusion that there is no longer a question of if there needs to be increased public participation in making decisions about science and technology, but now there needs to be ways to make a more meaningful conversation between the public and those developing the technology.&lt;ref name="Jasanoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jasanoff|first1=Sheila|title=Technologies of Humility: Citizen Participation in Governing Science|journal=Minerva|date=2003|volume=41|issue=3|pages=223–244 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1025557512320|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deliberative democracy in practice====
Ackerman and Fishkin offer an example of a reform in their paper "Deliberation Day." The deliberation is to enhance public understanding of popular, complex, and controversial issues, through devices such as Fishkin’s Deliberative Polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Bruce|last2=Fishkin|first2=James S.|title=Deliberation Day|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/media/news/2004/03/10/586/deliberation-day/|website=Center for American Progress|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although implementation of these reforms is unlikely in a large government situation such as the United States Federal Government. However, things similar to this have been implemented in small, local, governments like New England towns and villages. New England town hall meetings are a good example of deliberative democracy in a realistic setting.&lt;ref name="Bohman"/&gt;

An ideal Deliberative Democracy balances the voice and influence of all participants. While the main aim is to reach consensus, a deliberative democracy should encourage the voices of those with opposing viewpoints, concerns due to uncertainties, and questions about assumptions made by other participants. It should take its time and ensure that those participating understand the topics on which they debate. Independent managers of debates should also have substantial grasp of the concepts discussed, but must "[remain] independent and impartial as to the outcomes of the process."&lt;ref name="Chilvers"/&gt;

===Tragedy of the commons===
{{see also|Tragedy of the commons}}

In 1968, [[Garrett Hardin]] popularised the phrase "tragedy of the commons." It is an economic theory where rational people act against the best interest of the group by consuming a common resource. Since then, the tragedy of the commons has been used to symbolize the degradation of the environment whenever many individuals use a common resource. Although Garrett Hardin was not an STS scholar, the concept of tragedy of the commons still applies to science, technology and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardin|first1=Garrett|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/misc/webfeat/sotp/pdfs/162-3859-1243.pdf|website=www.sciencemag.org|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a contemporary setting, the Internet acts as an example of the tragedy of the commons through the exploitation of digital resources and private information. Data and internet passwords can be stolen much more easily than physical documents. Virtual spying is almost free compared to the costs of physical spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidow|first1=Bill|title=The Tragedy of the Internet Commons|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-tragedy-of-the-internet-commons/257290/#disqus_thread|website=theatlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[net neutrality]] can be seen as an example of tragedy of the commons in an STS context. The movement for net neutrality argues that the Internet should not be a resource that is dominated by one particular group, specifically those with more money to spend on Internet access.

A counterexample to the tragedy of the commons is offered by Andrew Kahrl. Privatization can be a way to deal with the tragedy of the commons. However, Kahrl suggests that the privatization of beaches on [[Long Island]], in an attempt to combat overuse of Long Island beaches, made the residents of Long Island more susceptible to flood damage from [[Hurricane Sandy]]. The privatization of these beaches took away from the protection offered by the natural landscape. Tidal lands that offer natural protection were drained and developed. This attempt to combat the tragedy of the commons by privatization was counter-productive. Privatization actually destroyed the public good of natural protection from the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahn|first1=Matthew E.|title=Environmental and Urban Economics|url=http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2012/12/a-counter-example-to-tragedy-of-commons.html|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative modernity===
Alternative [[modernity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenstadt|first1=Shmuel|title=Multiple Modernities|journal=Dædalus|date=Winter 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feenberg|first1=Andrew|title=Alternative Modernity : The Technical Turn in Philosophy and Social Theory|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520089860}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a conceptual tool conventionally used to represent the state of present western society. Modernity represents the political and social structures of the society, the sum of interpersonal discourse, and ultimately a snapshot of society's direction at a point in time. Unfortunately conventional modernity is incapable of modeling alternative directions for further growth within our society. Also, this concept is ineffective at analyzing similar but unique modern societies such as those found in the diverse cultures of the developing world. Problems can be summarized into two elements: inward failure to analyze growth potentials of a given society, and outward failure to model different cultures and social structures and predict their growth potentials.

Previously, modernity carried a connotation of the current state of being modern, and its evolution through European colonialism. The process of becoming "modern" is believed to occur in a linear, pre-determined way, and is seen by Philip Brey as a way of to interpret and evaluate social and cultural formations. This thought ties in with [[modernization theory]], the thought that societies progress from "pre-modern" to "modern" societies.

Within the field of science and technology, there are two main lenses with which to view modernity. The first is as a way for society to quantify what it wants to move towards. In effect, we can discuss the notion of "alternative modernity" (as described by Andrew Feenberg) and which of these we would like to move towards. Alternatively, modernity can be used to analyze the differences in interactions between cultures and individuals. From this perspective, alternative modernities exist simultaneously, based on differing cultural and societal expectations of how a society (or an individual within society) should function. Because of different types of interactions across different cultures, each culture will have a different modernity.

===Pace of innovation===
{{See also|Pace of innovation}}

Pace of Innovation is the speed at which technological innovation or advancement is occurring, with the most apparent instances being too slow or too rapid. Both these rates of innovation are extreme and therefore have effects on the people that get to use this technology.

===No innovation without representation===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{main|No innovation without representation}}

"No innovation without representation" is a democratic ideal of ensuring that everyone involved gets a chance to be represented fairly in technological developments.

* [[Langdon Winner]] states that groups and social interests likely to be affected by a particular kind of technological change ought to be represented at an early stage in defining exactly what that technology will be. It is the idea that relevant parties have a say in technological developments and are not left in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "Artifact/Ideas and Political Culture." Technology and the Future (1993): 283-92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spoken about by [[Massimiano Bucchi]]&lt;ref&gt;Bucchi, Massimiano. "No Innovation without Representation (A Parliament of Things for the New Technical Democracies)." http://www.fondazionebassetti.org/. 20 Dec. 2003. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* This ideal does not require the public to become experts on the topics of science and engineering, it only asks that the opinions and ideas be heard before making drastic decisions, as talked about by [[Steven L. Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Steven L. "No Innovation Without Representation: Technological Action in a Democratic Society." New Worlds, New Technologies, New Issues (1992): 148-60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privileged positions of business and science===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{Main|Privileged positions of business and science}}

The privileged positions of business and science refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge, ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

===Legacy thinking===

Legacy thinking is defined as an inherited method of thinking imposed from an external source without objection by the individual, because it is already widely accepted by society.

Legacy thinking can impair the ability to drive technology for the betterment of society by blinding people to innovations that do not fit into their accepted model of how society works.  By accepting ideas without questioning them, people often see all solutions that contradict these accepted ideas as impossible or impractical.  Legacy thinking tends to advantage the wealthy, who have the means to project their ideas on the public.  It may be used by the wealthy as a vehicle to drive technology in their favor rather than for the greater good.
Examining the role of citizen participation and representation in politics provides an excellent example of legacy thinking in society. The belief that one can spend money freely to gain influence has been popularized, leading to public acceptance of corporate [[lobbying]]. As a result, a self-established role in politics has been cemented where the public does not exercise the power ensured to them by the Constitution to the fullest extent. This can become a barrier to political progress as corporations who have the capital to spend have the potential to wield great influence over policy.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Bill, and Sarah Harkins. "Fixed Fortunes: Biggest Corporate Political Interests Spend Billions, Get Trillions." Sunlight Foundation Blog. Sunlight Foundation, 17 Nov. 2014. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking however keeps the population from acting to change this, despite polls from Harris Interactive that report over 80% of Americans feel that big business holds too much power in government.&lt;ref&gt;Corso, Regina, SVP. "PACs, Big Companies, Lobbyists, and Banks and Financial Institutions Seen by Strong Majorities as Having Too Much Power and Influence in DC." Harris Interactive: Harris Polls. Harris Interactive, 29 May 2012. Web. 21 Apr. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Americans are beginning to try to steer away this line of thought, rejecting legacy thinking, and demanding less corporate, and more public, participation in political decision making.

Additionally, an examination of [[net neutrality]] functions as a separate example of legacy thinking. Starting with [[dial-up]], the internet has always been viewed as a private luxury good.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Internet today is a vital part of modern-day society members. They use it in and out of life every day.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"&gt;"Net Neutrality: A Free and Open Internet." The White House. The White House, 26 Feb. 2015. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations are able to mislabel and greatly overcharge for their internet resources. Since the American public is so dependent upon internet there is little for them to do. Legacy thinking has kept this pattern on track despite growing movements arguing that the internet should be considered a &lt;!--which kind? - human right/..?--&gt;utility. Legacy thinking prevents progress because it was widely accepted by others before us through advertising that the internet is a luxury and not a &lt;!--basic?--&gt;utility. Due to pressure from grassroots movements the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has redefined the requirements for broadband and internet in general as a utility.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"/&gt; Now AT&amp;T and other major internet providers are lobbying against this action and are in-large able to delay the onset of this movement due to legacy thinking’s grip on American&lt;!--this article &amp; legacy thinking relates to the global population not just the American--&gt; culture and politics.

For example, those who cannot overcome the barrier of legacy thinking may not consider the [[water privatization|privatization of clean drinking water]] as an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Flow. Oscilloscope Pictures, 2008. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; This is partially because access to water has become such a given fact of the matter to them. For a person living in such circumstances, it may be widely accepted to not concern themselves with drinking water because they have not needed to be concerned with it in the past. Additionally, a person living within an area that does not need to worry about their water supply or the sanitation of their water supply is less likely to be concerned with the privatization of water.

This notion can be examined through the thought experiment of "[[veil of ignorance]]".&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Edward. Science Technology and Society. Spring 2015 ed. N.p.: U Readers, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking causes people to be particularly ignorant about the implications behind the "you get what you pay for" mentality applied to a life necessity. By utilizing the "veil of ignorance", one can overcome the barrier of legacy thinking as it requires a person to imagine that they are unaware of their own circumstances, allowing them to free themselves from externally imposed thoughts or widely accepted ideas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28915">'''Sex work''' is "the exchange of [[sexual services]], performances, or products for material compensation. It includes activities of direct physical contact between buyers and sellers as well as indirect sexual stimulation".&lt;ref name="Weitzer"&gt;''Sex for Sale: Prostitution, Pornography, and the Sex Industry'', edited by Ronald Weitzer, Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The term emphasizes the labor and economic implications of this type of work. Furthermore, some prefer the use of the term because it seemingly grants more agency to the sellers of these services. 
[[File:Red Light District.jpg|thumb|The Red Light district in Amsterdam]]

Because of the agency associated with the term, "sex work" generally refers to voluntary sexual transactions; thus the term does not refer to [[human trafficking]] and other coerced or nonconsensual sexual transactions.&lt;ref name="Trafficking"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alternet.org/story/84987/sex_work_vs._trafficking%3A_understanding_the_difference|title=Sex Work vs. Trafficking: Understanding the Difference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the legal status of some forms of sex work and the [[social stigma|stigma]] associated with sex work, the population is difficult to access; thus there has been relatively little academic research done on the topic. Furthermore, the vast majority of academic literature on sex work focuses on [[prostitution]], and to a lesser extent, [[stripper|exotic dancing]]; there is little research on other forms of sex work. These findings cannot necessarily be generalized to other forms of sex work. Nonetheless, there is a long documented history of sex work and its personal and economic nature.

==Types==
Types of sex work include, but are not limited to, street prostitution, indoor prostitution (escort services, [[brothel]] work, massage parlor-related prostitution, bar or casino prostitution), [[phone sex]] operation, exotic dancing, [[lap dancing]], webcam nude modeling, [[pornographic film]] performing, and nude [[peepshow]] performing. The list is sometimes expanded to include jobs in the [[sex industry]] that less directly involve the sexuality of the worker in the exchange of sexual performances, services, and products, such as the producers and directors of adult films, manufacturers and sellers of [[sex toy]]s, managers in exotic dance clubs, escort agents, bouncers, etc.
[[File:Porn Set 5.jpg|thumb|On the set of a pornographic film]]

In 2004, a Medline search and review of 681 "prostitution" articles was conducted in order to create a global typology of types of sex work using arbitrary categories. 25 types of sex work were identified in order to create a more systematic understanding of sex work as a whole. Prostitution varies by forms and social contexts including different types of direct and indirect prostitution. This study as conducted in order to work towards improving the health and safety of [[sex worker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, B. &amp; Harcourt, C. 2005. "The Many Faces of Sex Work." Sexually Transmitted Infections 81(3):201-206.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sex work, in many different forms, has been practiced since ancient times. It is reported that even in the most primitive societies, there was transactional sex. Prostitution was widespread in ancient Egypt and Greece, where it was practiced at various socioeconomic levels. [[Hetaera]] in Greece and [[geisha]] in Japan were seen as prestigious members of society for their high level of training in companionship. Attitudes towards prostitution have shifted through history. 
[[File:NAMA Courtisane &amp; client.jpg|thumb|An Ancient Greek urn depicts a prostitute and her client]]

During the [[Middle Ages]] prostitution was tolerated but not celebrated. It wasn't until the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century that attitudes turned against prostitution on a large scale and bodies began to be regulated more heavily. These moral reforms were to a large extent directed towards the restriction of women's autonomy. Furthermore, enforcement of regulations regarding prostitution disproportionately impacted the poor.&lt;ref name="Ditmore"&gt;Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work, Volumes 1 &amp; 2, edited by Melissa Hope Ditmore, Greenwood Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex work has a long history in the United States, yet laws regulating the sale of sex are relatively new. In the 18th century, prostitution was deeply rooted from Louisiana to San Francisco. Despite its prevalence, attitudes towards prostitutes were negative and many times hostile. Although the law did not directly address prostitution at this time, law enforcement often targeted prostitutes. Laws against lewdness and [[sodomy]] were used in an attempt to regulate sex work. [[Red-light district]]s formed in the 19th century in major cities across the country in an attempt by sex workers to find spaces where they could work, isolated from outside society and corresponding stigma.

Ambiguity in the law allowed for prostitutes to challenge imprisonment in the courts. Through these cases prostitutes forced a popular recognition of their profession and defended their rights and property. Despite sex workers efforts, social reformers looking to abolish prostitution outright began to gain traction in the early 20th century. New laws focused on the third-party businesses where prostitution took place, such as saloons and brothels, holding the owners culpable for the activities that happened within their premises. Red-light districts began to close. Finally, in 1910 the [[Mann Act]], or "White Slave Traffic Act" made illegal the act of coercing a person into prostitution or other immoral activity, the first federal law addressing prostitution. This act was created to address the trafficking of young, European girls who were thought to have been kidnapped and transported to the United States to work in brothels, but criminalized those participating in consensual sex work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of American History: With the Complete Text of the Constitution of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqG-B4jsMIAC|first1=Michael Rheta|last1=Martin|first2=Leonard|last2=Gelber|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1978|isbn=9780822601241|page=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, at the start of the First World War, a Navy decree forced the closure of sex-related businesses in close proximity to military bases. Restrictions and outright violence led to the loss of the little control workers had over their work. In addition to this, in 1918, the Chamberlain-Kahn Act made it so that any woman found to have a [[sexually transmitted disease]] (STD) would be quarantined by the government. The original purpose of this act was to stop the spread of venereal diseases among U.S. soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ann|first1=Moseley|title=Cather Studies, Volume 11|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803296992|pages=384|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1915 under this act, prostitutes, or those perceived to be prostitutes could be stopped, inspected, and detained or sent to a rehabilitation facility if they were found to test positive for any venereal disease. During the [[World War I]], an estimate 30,00 women were detained and examined. The state had made sex workers into legal outcasts.&lt;ref name="Crime"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grant |first1=Melissa Gira |title=When Prostitution Wasn't a Crime: The Fascinating History of Sex Work in America |url=https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/when-prostitution-wasnt-crime-fascinating-history-sex-work-america |website=[[AlterNet]] |accessdate=31 May 2018 |date=18 February 2013| author-link=Melissa Gira Grant }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], black women in New York City accounted for more than 50 percent of arrests for prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanshard|first1=Paul|title=Negro Deliquency in New York|journal=The Journal of Educational Sociology|date=October 1942|volume=16|page=115-123|doi=10.237/2262442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of sex work expanded in the 21st century. Film and later the internet provided new opportunities for sex work. In 1978, [[Carol Leigh]], a prostitute and activist, coined the term "sex work" as it is now used. She looked to combat the anti-porn movement by coining a term that reflected the labor and economic implications of the work. The term came into popular use in the 1980s. (bayswan). [[COYOTE]] (Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics) and other similar groups formed in the 1970s and 80s to push for women's sexual freedom and [[sex workers' rights]]. A rift formed within feminism that continues today, with some arguing for the abolishment of sex work and others working for acceptance and rights for sex works.

The [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] epidemic presented a new challenge to sex workers. The criminalization of exposing others to AIDS significantly impacted sex workers. Harm reduction strategies were organized providing testing, counseling, and supplies to stop the spread of the disease. This experience organizing helped facilitate future action for social justice. The threat of violence persists in many types of sex work. Unionization of legal types of sex work such as exotic dancers, lobbying of public health officials and labor officials, and human rights agencies has improved conditions for many sex workers. Nonetheless, the political ramifications of supporting a stigmatized population make organizing around sex work difficult. Despite these difficulties, actions against violence and for increased visibility and rights persist drawing hundreds of thousands of participants.&lt;ref name="swaay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swaay.org/history.html|title=Sex Work Activists, Allies, and You History }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
The legal status of sex work is reliant on the type of sex work and the location in question. In the United States sex work is largely regulated at the state level. Prostitution is illegal in almost every state, with Nevada being the only exception (see [[Prostitution law]]). Most other forms of sex work&amp;nbsp;– those which do not involve engagement in sex acts via bodily contact&amp;nbsp;– are legal if the sex worker is 18 or older and consenting.

==Emotional labor==
[[Emotional labor]] is an essential part of many service jobs, including many types of sex work. Through emotional labor sex workers engage in different levels of acting known as surface acting and deep acting. These levels reflect a sex worker's engagement with the emotional labor. Surface acting occurs when the sex worker is aware of the dissonance between their authentic experience of emotion and their managed emotional display. In contrast deep acting occurs when the sex worker can no longer differentiate between what is authentic and what is acting; acting becomes authentic.&lt;ref name="Hochschild"&gt;Hochschild, A. ''The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling'', University of California Press, LTD, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Woman lying on bed, looking at mirror, Berlin 2001.jpg|thumb|A prostitute in Berlin in 2001]]

Sex workers engage in emotional labor for many different reasons. First, sex workers often engage in emotional labor to construct performances of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;Frank, K. ''G-Strings and Sympathy: Strip Club Regulars and Male Desire'', Duke University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanders |first=T. |year=2005 |title='It's Just Acting': Sex Workers' Strategies for Capitalizing of Sexuality |journal=Gender, Work, and Organization |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=319–342 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00276.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trautner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trautner |first=M. |year=2005 |title=Doing Gender, Doing Class: the Performance of Sexuality in Exotic Dance Clubs |journal=Gender and Society |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=771–788 |doi=10.1177/0891243205277253}}&lt;/ref&gt; These performances frequently reflect the desires of a clientele which is mostly composed of heterosexual men. In the majority of cases, clients value women who they perceive as normatively feminine. For women sex workers, achieving this perception necessitates a performance of gender and (hetero)sexuality that involves deference to clients and affirmation of their [[masculinity]], as well as physical embodiment of traditional femininity.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewis"&gt;Brewis, J., &amp; Linstead, S. ''Sex, Work and Sex Work'', Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional labor involved in sex work may be of a greater significance when race differences are involved. For instance Mistress Velvet, a black, femme [[dominatrix]] advertises herself using her most fetishized attributes. She makes her clients, who are mostly white cis males, read Black feminist theory before their sessions. This allows the clients to see why their participation, as white cis males, contributes to the fetishization of black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duberman|first1=Amanda|title=Meet The Dominatrix Who Requires The Men Who Hire Her To Read Black Feminist Theory|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mistress-velvet_us_5a822b50e4b00ecc923d4eba|website=www.huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both within sex work and in other types of work, emotional labor is gendered in that women are expected to use it to construct performances of normative [[femininity]], whereas men are expected to use it to construct performances of normative masculinity.&lt;ref name="Hochschild" /&gt; In both cases, these expectations are often met because this labor is necessary to maximizing monetary gain and potentially to job retention. Indeed, emotional labor is often used as a means to maximize income. It fosters a better experience for the client and protects the worker thus enabling the worker to make the most profit.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sijuwade"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sijuwade |first=P. |year=1996 |title=Counterfeit Intimacy: Dramaturgical Analysis of an Erotic Performance |journal=International Journal of Sociology of the Family |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=29–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, sex workers often engage in emotional labor as a self-protection strategy, distancing themselves from the sometimes emotionally volatile work.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders" /&gt; Finally, clients often value perceived authenticity in their transactions with sex workers; thus, sex workers may attempt to foster a sense of authentic intimacy.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sijuwade" /&gt;

== Intimate relationships ==
A study in Melbourne, Australia found that sex workers typically experience relationship difficulties as a result of their line of work. This primarily stems from the issue of disclosure of their work in personal relationships. Some sex workers noted that dating ex-clients is helpful as they have had contact with sex workers and they are aware of their employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bellhouse |first1=Clare |last2=Crebbin |first2=Susan |last3=Fairley |first3=Christopher K. |last4=Bilardi |first4=Jade E. |title=The Impact of Sex Work on Women’s Personal Romantic Relationships and the Mental Separation of Their Work and Personal Lives: A Mixed-Methods Study |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141575 |website=PLOS ONE |accessdate=31 May 2018 |pages=e0141575 |language=en |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141575 |date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is very little empirical evidence characterizing clients of sex workers, but they may share an analogues problem. A Scientific American article on sex buyers summarises a limited field of research which indicates that Johns have a normal psychological profile matching the makeup of the wider male population, but view themselves as mentally unwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-men-buy-sex-2012-10-23|title=Why Do Men Buy Sex?|first=Nikolas|last=Westerhoff|date=1 October 2012|journal=Scientific American|volume=21|issue=2s|pages=60–65|doi=10.1038/scientificamericanbrain0512-60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualitative studies indicate that repeat buyers become romantically attached and idealise sex workers of choice as their perfect partners.

=== Commodified intimacy ===
In clients' encounters with prostitutes or exotic dancers (and potentially other sex workers as well), many seek more than sexual satisfaction. They often seek, via their interactions with sex workers, an affirmation of their masculinity, which they may feel is lacking in other aspects of their lives.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewis" /&gt; This affirmation comes in the form of (a simulation of) affection and sexual desire, and "smooth, intimate, affective space, wherein the way that time is managed is governed only by mutual desire and enjoyment."&lt;ref name="Brewis" /&gt; Partly because they are engaged in work during these interactions, prostitutes' experience and interpretation of time tends to be structured instead by desires to maximize income, avoid boredom, and/or avoid detriment to self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Brewis" /&gt;

For sex workers, commodified intimacy provides different benefits. In Brazil, sex workers prioritize foreign men over local men in terms of forming intimate relationships with sex workers. This is a result of local men regarding sex workers as having no worth beyond their occupation. In contrast, foreign men are often accompanied by wealth and status, which are factors that can help a sex worker become independent. Hence sex workers in Brazil are more likely to seek out "ambiguous entanglements" with the foreign men they provide services for, rather than the local men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Erica|title=Sex Tourism in Bahia: Ambiguous Entanglements|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0252079443|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences==
Interviews with men and women escorts illuminate gender differences in these escorts' experiences.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt; On average, women escorts charged much more than men.&lt;ref name="Fogg"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://andrewfogg.com/2014/10/14/gender-differences-amongst-sex-workers-online/ | title=Gender differences amongst sex workers online | last=Fogg | first=A. | date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=September 2018}} Compared to traditional women escorts, women in niche markets charged lower rates. However, this disparity in rates did not exist for men escorts. Men escorts reported widespread acceptance in the gay community; they were much more likely than women to disclose their occupation.{{cn|date=September 2018}} This community acceptance is fairly unusual to the gay community and not the experience of many women sex workers. Also, heterosexual men prostitutes are much more likely than heterosexual women prostitutes to entertain same-gender clients out of necessity, because the vast majority of clients are men.&lt;ref name="Brewis" /&gt; In general, there is a greater social expectation for women to engage in emotional labor than there is for men; there are also greater consequences if they do not.&lt;ref name="Hochschild" /&gt;

==Risks==
The potential risks sex work poses to the worker vary greatly depending on the specific job they occupy. Compared to outdoor or street-based sex workers, indoor workers are less likely to face violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krusi|first1=A|title=Negotiating safety and sexual risk reduction with clients in unsanctioned safer indoor sex work environments: a qualitative study|journal=Am J Public Health|date=Jun 2012|volume=102|issue=6|pages=1154–9|doi=10.2105/ajph.2011.300638|pmid=22571708|pmc=3484819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Street sex workers may also more likely to use addictive drugs, to have unprotected sex, and to be the victim of sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt; HIV affects large numbers of sex workers who engage in prostitution, of all genders, globally. Rape and violence, poverty, stigma, and social exclusion are all common risks faced by sex workers in many different occupations.&lt;ref name="Ditmore" /&gt; A study of violence against women engaged in street prostitution found that 68% reported having been raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1300/J012v11n04_04|title=Prostitution|journal=Women &amp; Criminal Justice|volume=11|issue=4|pages=29|year=2008|last1=Farley|first1=Melissa|last2=Kelly|first2=Vanessa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex workers are also in a high risk of murder. According to Salfati's study, sex workers are 60 to 120 times more likely to be murdered than nonprostitute females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0886260507312946|pmid=18319375|title=Prostitute Homicides: A Descriptive Study|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|volume=23|issue=4|pages=505|year=2008|last1=Salfati|first1=C. G.|last2=James|first2=A. R.|last3=Ferguson|first3=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these features tend to apply more to sex workers who engage in full service sex work, stigma and safety risks are pervasive for all types of sex work, albeit to different extents.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krusi|first1=A|title=Negotiating safety and sexual risk reduction with clients in unsanctioned safer indoor sex work environments: a qualitative study|journal=Am J Public Health|date=Jun 2012|volume=102|issue=6|pages=1154–9|doi=10.2105/ajph.2011.300638|pmid=22571708|pmc=3484819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the varied legal status of some forms of sex work, sex workers in some countries also face the risk of incarceration.

==Feminist/liberalist debate==
{{POV-section|date=January 2017}}
Feminist debates on sex work (see [[Feminist views of pornography]] and [[Feminist views on prostitution|prostitution]]) focus primarily on pornography and prostitution. Feminist arguments against these occupations tend to be founded in the notion that these types of work are inherently degrading to women, perpetuate the sexual objectification of women, and/or perpetuate male supremacy.&lt;ref name="Dworkin"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/aclu/dworkin/michlawjouri.html | title=Prostitution and Male Supremacy | last=Dworkin | first=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In response, proponents of sex work argue that these claims deny women sex workers' agency, and that choosing to engage in this work can be empowering. They contend that the perspectives of anti-sex work feminists are based on notions of sexuality constructed by the patriarchy to regulate women's expressions sexuality.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"&gt;O'Connell Davidson, J. ''Prostitution, Power, and Freedom.'' Polity Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many feminists who support the sex industry claim that criminalizing sex work causes more harm to women and their sexual autonomy. An article in the Touro Law Review 2014, focuses on the challenges faced by prostitutes in the U.S and the need for prostitution reform. "[By criminalizing prostitution] women lose the choice to get paid for having consensual sex. A woman may have sex for free, but once she receives something of value for her services, the act becomes illegal".&lt;ref&gt;Carrasquillo, Tesla. "Understanding Prostitution and the Need for Reform." Touro Law Review 30.3 (2014): 697-721. Ebscohost&lt;/ref&gt; Those who see this as an attack on a women's sexual autonomy also worry about the recent attacks on liberal social policy, such as same sex marriage and abortion on demand, in the U.S.  Paradoxically, liberals argue that since a disproportionate share of those who choose sex work as a means of income are the poor and disadvantaged, public officials should focus on social policies improving the lives of those choosing to do so rather than condemnation of the "private" means which those victims of society employ.&lt;ref name="Feministe"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2009/07/29/7-key-american-sex-worker-activist-projects/ | title=Audacia Ray in Feministe "7 Key American Sex Worker Activist Projects"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debates on sex worker agency ===
The topic of sexual labor is often contextualized within opposing abolitionist and sex-positive perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hakim|first=Catherine|year=2015|title=Economies of Desire: Sexuality and the Sex Industry in the 21st Century|url=http://www.catherinehakim.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/EconomicAffairs-2015-Economies-of-Desire.pdf|journal=Economic Affairs|volume=35|pages=329–348|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Temporarily Yours: Intimacy, Authenticity, and the Commerce of Sex|last=Bernstein|first=Elizabeth|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abolitionist perspective typically defines sex work as an oppressive form of labor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Comte|first=Jacqueline|year=2013|title=Decriminalization of Sex Work: Feminist Discourses in Light of Research|url=|journal=Sexuality and Culture|volume=|pages=196–217|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to opponents of prostitution, it is not only the literal purchase of a person's body for sexual exploitation, it also constitutes exertion of power over women both symbolically and materially. This perspective views prostitution and trafficking as directly and intimately connected and therefore calls for the abolition of prostitution in efforts to eliminate the overall sexual exploitation of women and children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Opponents also refute the idea of consent among sex workers by claiming that such consent is merely a submissive acceptance of the traditional exploitation of women. For these reasons, opponents believe that the [[Decriminalizing sex work|decriminalization of sex work]] would utterly harm women as a class by maintaining their sexual and economic exploitation while "serving the interests of pimps, procurers and prostitutors".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Sex-positive feminism|Sex positive feminists]] recognize sex workers as situated within a modern Western sexual hierarchy where a married man and woman are respected while transsexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, fetishists, and sex workers such as prostitutes and porn models are viewed as sexual deviants.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|year=1984|title=Thinking Sex: Notes toward a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality|url=|journal=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality|volume=|pages=275–284|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to sex positive feminists, sex law incorporates a prohibition against mixing sex and money in order to sustain this hierarchy. Therefore, the individuals who practice these "deviant" sexual acts are deemed as criminals and have limited institutional support and are subjected to economic sanctions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sex-positive perspectives challenge this hierarchy by appreciating [[sexual diversity]] and rejecting any notion of "normal" sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Matters: Future Visions for a Sex-Positive Society|last=Windsor|first=Elroi|publisher=Norton|year=2014|isbn=978-0-393-93586-8|location=New York|pages=691–699|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this understanding, people who choose to engage in criminalized sex acts are seen as autonomous sexual beings rather than victims of the sex industry. For black women, agency is viewed as contextual due to historical considerations, and can be regarded as one facet of a complex system of ideals that encompass black women's sexuality over time. One result of this is the way that race relations impact the mobility of black people in the [[sex industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller-Young|first1=Mireille|title=A Taste for Brown Sugar, Black Women in Pornography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x4_uBQAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Duke University Press Book|isbn=978-0822358282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal feminists believe that a "democratic morality" should judge sexual activity (as if the proclivities of the majority, as well as their proficiency in providing sexual pleaure(s), should determine the direction of a society's moral compass) "by the way partners treat one another, the presence or absence of coercion, and the quantity and quality of the pleasures they provide".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They propound that it should not be an ethical concern whether sex acts are coupled or in groups, same or mixed sex, with or without consensual acts of violence or video, commercial or free.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Nuclear reactor in dimona (israel).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center as viewed from a [[Corona (satellite)|Corona satellite]] in the late 1960s]]
The '''Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center''' ({{lang-he|קריה למחקר גרעיני – נגב צ"ש שמעון פרס}}, formerly the ''Negev Nuclear Research Center'', unofficially sometimes referred to as the ''Dimona reactor'') is an [[Israel]]i [[nuclear power|nuclear]] installation located in the [[Negev]] [[desert]], about thirteen kilometers south-east of the city of [[Dimona]]. In August 2018, it was renamed after the late [[President of Israel|President]] and [[Prime Minister of Israel]], and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Shimon Peres]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/at-nuclear-facility-netanyahu-lobs-stark-warning-at-iran/ At nuclear facility, Netanyahu lobs stark warning at Iran]&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the facility began in 1958 and its [[heavy-water]] [[nuclear reactor]] went active sometime between 1962-1964. Israel claims that the nuclear reactor and research facility is for research purposes into atomic science.{{sfn|Nuclear Research Center}} However, the purpose of the reactor is believed to be the production of nuclear materials that may be used in [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|Israel's nuclear weapon]]s.{{sfn|William|2013}} Information about the facility remains highly [[classified information|classified]] and with respect to nuclear weapons the country maintains a policy known as [[Policy of deliberate ambiguity|nuclear ambiguity]]—refusing either to confirm or deny their possession. Israel had produced its first nuclear weapons by 1967 and it has been estimated to possess anywhere between 80-400 nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Cohen|2010|pp = xxvii, 82}}

The airspace over the Dimona facility is closed to all aircraft, and the area around it is heavily guarded and fenced off. During the [[Six-Day War]], an Israeli missile shot down an Israeli Air Force [[Dassault Ouragan]] fighter that inadvertently flew over Dimona.{{sfn|Mahnaimi|2007}}{{sfn|Time|1976}}

== History ==

=== Construction ===
Construction commenced in 1958, with [[France|French]] assistance according to the [[Protocol of Sèvres]] agreements.{{sfn|Fox News|2001}} The complex was constructed in secret, and outside the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] inspection regime.{{sfn|Ben-Gedalyahu|2013}} To maintain secrecy, French customs officials were told that the largest of the [[Nuclear reactor|reactor]] components, such as the reactor tank, were part of a [[desalination plant]] bound for Latin America.{{sfn|Aftergood, Kristensen|2007}} Estimates of the cost of construction vary; the only reliable figure is from [[Shimon Peres]], who wrote in his 1995 memoir that he and [[David Ben-Gurion]] collected US $40 million, "half the price of a reactor ... [from] Israel's friends around the world."{{sfn|Pinkus|2002}}

The Dimona reactor became [[criticality (status)|critical]] sometime between 1962 and 1964, and with the [[plutonium]] produced there the [[Israel Defense Forces]] most probably had their first nuclear weapons ready before the Six-Day War.

=== Inspections ===
When the [[United States]] intelligence community discovered the purpose of the site in the early 1960s, the U.S. government demanded that Israel agree to international inspections. Israel agreed, but on the condition that U.S., rather than [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], inspectors be used, and that Israel would receive advance notice of all inspections. Israel is one of three nations not to have signed the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]] (others are [[India and weapons of mass destruction|India]] and [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistan]], both of which have acknowledged having nuclear weapons), and alongside [[North Korea]] which left the NPT.{{sfn|UN|2005}}

Some claim that because Israel knew the schedule of the inspectors' visits, it was able to hide the illegal manufacture of nuclear weapons, thereby deceiving the inspectors, by installing temporary false walls and other devices before each inspection.{{sfn|Kintner}} The inspectors eventually informed the U.S. government that their inspections were useless, due to Israeli restrictions on what areas of the facility they could inspect. By 1969 the U.S. believed that Israel might have a nuclear weapon,{{sfn|Burr|2006}} and terminated inspections that year.

=== Jet aircraft take-down ===
The Dimona reactor was overflown by unidentified jet aircraft before the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. These planes were thought at the time to be [[Egyptian Air Force]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]]s, although a controversial 2007 book argues that they were actually [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|Soviet MiG-25s]].{{sfn|Ginor, Remez|2007}} During the war, an Israeli fighter jet damaged in a bombing raid over Jordan was shot down by air defenses protecting the reactor after straying over it, killing the pilot, Captain Yoram Harpaz.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-how-israel-s-nuclear-reactor-was-covered-up-1.5351217&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear weapons production ===

The full-scale production of nuclear warheads is believed to have commenced by 1966, with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] believed to be in possession of up to 13 operational nuclear warheads by 1967.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', April 12, 1976, quoted in Weissman and Krosney, op. cit., 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mordechai Vanunu revelations ===
[[File:Vanunu-glove-box-bomb-components.jpg|thumb|Vanunu's photograph of a Negev Nuclear Research Center glove box containing nuclear materials in a model bomb assembly, one of about 60 photographs he later gave to the British press.]]
In 1986, [[Mordechai Vanunu]], a former technician at Dimona, fled to the [[United Kingdom]] and revealed to the media some evidence of Israel's nuclear program and explained the purposes of each building, also revealing a top-secret underground facility directly below the installation. The [[Mossad]], Israel's secret service, sent a female agent named [[Cheryl Bentov]] (née Hanin) who lured Vanunu to [[Italy]], where he was kidnapped by Mossad agents and smuggled to Israel aboard a freighter. An Israeli court then tried him in secret on charges of [[treason]] and [[espionage]], and sentenced him to eighteen years imprisonment. At the time of Vanunu's kidnapping, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that Israel had material for approximately 20 [[hydrogen bombs]] and 200 [[fission bomb]]s by 1986. In the spring of 2004, Vanunu was released from prison, and placed under several strict restrictions, such as the denial of a passport, freedom of movement limitations and restrictions on communications with the press. Since his release, he has been rearrested and charged multiple times for violations of the terms of his release.{{sfn|Timms|2004}}{{sfn|AFP|2015}}

=== Safety concerns ===
Safety concerns about the 55+ year-old reactor have been reported. In 2004, as a preventive measure, Israeli authorities distributed [[potassium iodide]] anti-radiation tablets to thousands of residents living nearby.{{sfn|AFP|2004}}

In 2006 a group of local residents was formed{{Who|date=January 2012}} due to concerns regarding serious threats to health and safety from living near the reactor.

==== Human experimentation ====
According to a lawsuit filed in Be'er Sheva Labor Tribunal, workers at the center were subjected to [[Human subject research|human experimentation]] in 1998. According to Julius Malick, the worker who submitted the lawsuit, they were given drinks containing [[uranium]] without medical supervision and without obtaining written consent or warning them about risks of side effects.{{sfn|Melman|2009}}
The lawsuit was rejected by the court and the worker's claims were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=גולן |first1=גדי |title=נדחתה תביעת עובד הכור שטען: "אולצתי לשתות אורניום" |url=https://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/130169 |accessdate=20 November 2018 |work=ישראל היום |date=6 November 2013 |language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Attacks ====
In January 2012, media reports indicated that the [[Israel Atomic Energy Commission]] had decided to temporarily shut down the reactor. The site's vulnerability to attack from Iran was cited as the main reason for the decision.{{sfn|Mahnaimi|2012}} In October and November 2012, it was reported that [[Hamas]] had fired rockets at Dimona and/or Negev Nuclear Research Center.{{sfn|Debka|2012}}{{sfn|Arutz Sheva|2012}} In July 2014 Hamas again fired rockets towards the area surrounding the reactor. The facility was not harmed or damaged in any of the attempted strikes.{{sfn|Big News Network|2014}}

=== Declassified documents ===
In April 2016  the U.S. [[National Security Archive]] declassified dozens of documents from 1960 to 1970, which detail what American intelligence viewed as Israel’s attempts to obfuscate the purpose and details of its nuclear program. The Americans involved in discussions with Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] and other Israelis believed the country was providing “untruthful cover” about intentions to build nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Adaret|2016}}

== Conspiracy theories ==

=== John F. Kennedy ===
In 2004, Mordechai Vanunu stated that the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] was Israel's response to "pressure [Kennedy] exerted on...Ben-Gurion, to shed light on Dimona's nuclear reactor in Israel".{{sfn|SMH|2004}} The [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] claimed during a [[United Nations]] General Assembly speech in 2009 that [[Israel]] had ordered the killing of [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] because Kennedy had wanted to investigate the Negev Nuclear Plant.{{sfn|JTA|2009}}{{sfn|Lynfield|2011|p=}}

'''Skretting Aquaculture Research Centre''' A/S (Skretting ARC) was established in 1989, and is the central [[R&amp;D]] unit for the global [[fish]] and [[shrimp]] [[Feeds for farmed fish|feed]] concern [[Skretting]], which is owned by [[Nutreco|Nutreco N.V.]] Nutreco’s head office is in [[Amersfoort]], The Netherlands. Skretting ARC's main objective is to provide research and technical support regarding fish and shrimp feed. Skretting ARC has about 60 manyears of which about 45% have degrees corresponding to MSc or PhD level. It has an international staff representing 13 nationalities. It performs research for all feed companies within Skretting in Europe, North &amp; South America, Asia and Australia. Skretting ARC’  is a legal entity owned 100% by Skretting AS.

== Core competencies ==
Skretting ARC’s core competencies are within fish and shrimp nutrition and health, raw feed materials, feed safety &amp; quality and feed manufacturing processes. Skretting ARC’s facilities include an extensive research station with hatchery and land based tanks with both fresh and seawater trial facilities, a pilot plant for test feed production and innovative process trials and a well-equipped modern laboratory. The research station is designed for running trials with [[Salmonidae|salmonids]] through all life stages with different water qualities (temperature and salinity). Facilities are also adapted for running trials with [[cod]] after [[metamorphosis]]. Main facilities are located within the vicinity of [[Stavanger]], however Skretting also has a trout facility in Italy and is working towards a facility in Asia. Skretting ARC collaborates with several universities and institutes around the world.

== Projects ==
Skretting ARC has participated in several [[Norwegian Research Council]] and [[European Union|EU]]-funded research projects over the years. Its researchers have been authors or co-authors of several scientific publications. Some examples of EU projects are:

{{Sociology}}
'''Sociology of religion''' is the study of the [[belief]]s, practices and organizational forms of [[religion]] using the tools and methods of the discipline of [[sociology]]. This objective investigation may include the use of both [[Quantitative research|quantitative methods]] (surveys, polls, demographic and census analysis) and [[Qualitative research|qualitative approaches]] such as participant observation, interviewing, and analysis of archival, historical and documentary materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/sociology/about_the_field.html|title=The Sociological Study of Religion|author=|date=|website=hirr.hartsem.edu|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302152641/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/sociology/about_the_field.html|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern academic sociology began with the analysis of religion in [[Émile Durkheim]]'s 1897 [[suicide (book)|study of suicide]] rates among [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] populations, a foundational work of [[social research]] which served to distinguish sociology from other disciplines, such as [[psychology]]. The works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Max Weber]] emphasized the relationship between religion and the economic or social structure of society. Contemporary debates have centered on issues such as [[secularization]], [[civil religion]], and the cohesiveness of religion in the context of [[globalization]] and [[multiculturalism]]. The contemporary sociology of religion may also encompass the sociology of [[irreligion]] (for instance, in the analysis of [[secular humanist]] belief systems).

Sociology of religion is distinguished from the [[philosophy of religion]] in that it does not set out to assess the validity of religious beliefs. The process of comparing multiple conflicting [[dogma]]s may require what [[Peter L. Berger]] has described as inherent "methodological atheism".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967). Anchor Books 1990 paperback: {{ISBN|0-385-07305-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the sociology of religion broadly differs from [[theology]] in assuming indifference to the supernatural, theorists tend to acknowledge socio-cultural [[reification (fallacy)|reification]] of [[Cult (religious practice)|religious practice]].

==View of religion in classical sociology==
Classical, seminal sociological theorists of the late 19th and early 20th century such as [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], and [[Karl Marx]] were greatly interested in [[religion]] and its effects on society. Like those of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] from ancient Greece, and Enlightenment philosophers from the 17th through 19th centuries, the ideas posited by these sociologists continue to be examined today.
Durkheim, Marx, and Weber had very complex and developed theories about the nature and effects of religion. Of these, Durkheim and Weber are often more difficult to understand, especially in light of the lack of context and examples in their primary texts. Religion was considered to be an extremely important social variable in the work of all three.

===Karl Marx===
{{Main|Marxism and religion}}
According to Kevin J. Christiano et al., "Marx was the product of the Enlightenment, embracing its call to replace faith by reason and religion by science." But he "did not believe in science for science's sake … he believed that he was also advancing a theory that would … be a useful tool … [in] effecting a revolutionary upheaval of the capitalist system in favor of [[socialism]]."&lt;ref&gt;Christiano 2008, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the crux of his arguments was that humans are best guided by reason. Religion, Marx held, was a significant hindrance to [[reason]], inherently masking the [[truth]] and misguiding followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Settimba|first=Henry|title=Testing times : globalisation and investing theology in East Africa|year=2009|publisher=Author House|location=Milton Keynes|isbn=1-4389-4798-4|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; As we will later see, [[Marx's theory of alienation|Marx viewed alienation]] as the heart of [[social inequality]]. The antithesis to this [[Social alienation|alienation]] is [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]]. Thus, to propagate freedom means to present individuals with the truth and give them a choice to accept or deny it. In this, "Marx never suggested that religion ought to be prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;Christiano 2008, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Marx's theories was the oppressive economic situation in which he dwelt. With the rise of [[Industrial Revolution|European industrialism]], Marx and his colleague [[Friedrich Engels]] witnessed and responded to the growth of what he called "[[surplus value]]". Marx's view of capitalism saw rich capitalists getting richer and their workers getting poorer (the gap, the exploitation, was the "surplus value"). Not only were workers getting exploited, but in the process they were being further detached from the products they helped create. By simply selling their work for [[wage]]s, "workers simultaneously lose connection with the object of labor and become objects themselves. Workers are devalued to the level of a commodity{{spaced ndash}}a thing …"&lt;ref&gt;Christiano 2008, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; From this [[objectification]] comes alienation. The common worker is led to believe that he or she is a replaceable tool, and is alienated to the point of extreme discontent. Here, in Marx's eyes, religion enters. Capitalism utilizes our tendency towards religion as a tool or [[ideological state apparatus]] to justify this alienation. Christianity teaches that those who gather up riches and power in this life will almost certainly not be rewarded in the next ("it is harder for a rich man to enter the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]] than it is for a camel to pass through the [[eye of a needle]] …") while those who suffer [[oppression]] and poverty in this life, while cultivating their spiritual wealth, will be rewarded in the Kingdom of God. Hence Marx's famous line – "[[Opium of the people|religion is the opium of the people]]", as it soothes them and dulls their senses to the pain of oppression. Some scholars have recently noted that this is a contradictory (or dialectical) metaphor, referring to religion as both an expression of suffering and a protest against suffering.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2005). 'Reading ‘Opium of the People’: Expression, Protest and the Dialectics of Religion'. Critical Sociology, vol 31, no. 1-2, pp. 15–38. {{cite web |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3074/1/marx_religion_and_opium_final_author_version.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818030414/http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3074/1/marx_religion_and_opium_final_author_version.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Émile Durkheim===
Émile Durkheim placed himself in the [[positivism|positivist]] tradition, meaning that he thought of his study of society as dispassionate and scientific. He was deeply interested in the problem of what held complex modern societies together. Religion, he argued, was an expression of social cohesion.

In the fieldwork that led to his famous ''[[Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]'', Durkheim, a [[secularism|secular]] Frenchman, looked at anthropological data of [[Indigenous Australians]]. His underlying interest was to understand the basic forms of religious life for all societies. In ''Elementary Forms'', Durkheim argues that the [[totem]]s the Aborigines venerate are actually expressions of their own conceptions of society itself. This is true not only for the Aborigines, he argues, but for all societies.

Religion, for Durkheim, is not "imaginary", although he does deprive it of what many believers find essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bellah |first=Robert Nelly |date=1973 |title=Emile Durkheim: on morality and society |url= |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=191 |isbn= 9780226173368 |author-link=Robert Neelly Bellah }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is very real; it is an expression of society itself, and indeed, there is no society that does not have religion. We perceive as individuals a force greater than ourselves, which is our social life, and give that perception a [[supernatural]] face. We then express ourselves religiously in groups, which for Durkheim makes the [[symbolic power]] greater. Religion is an expression of our collective consciousness, which is the fusion of all of our individual consciousnesses, which then creates a reality of its own.

It follows, then, that less complex societies, such as the Australian Aborigines, have less complex religious systems, involving totems associated with particular [[clan]]s. The more complex a particular society, the more complex the religious system is. As societies come in contact with other societies, there is a tendency for religious systems to emphasize [[universalism]] to a greater and greater extent. However, as the [[division of labour]] makes the individual seem more important (a subject that Durkheim treats extensively in his famous ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]''), religious systems increasingly focus on individual [[salvation]] and [[conscience]].

Durkheim's [[definition of religion]], from ''Elementary Forms'', is as follows: "A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden – beliefs and practices which unite into one single [[moral community]] called a Church, all those who adhere to them."&lt;ref name="Swain"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/elementaryformso00durk ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1915)'']: Translated by Joseph Ward Swain, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; This is a functional definition of religion, meaning that it explains what religion ''does'' in social life: essentially, it unites societies. Durkheim defined religion as a clear distinction between the [[sacred–profane dichotomy|sacred and the profane]], in effect this can be paralleled with the distinction between [[God]] and humans.

This definition also does not stipulate what exactly may be considered [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]]. Thus later sociologists of religion (notably [[Robert Neelly Bellah]]) have extended Durkheimian insights to talk about notions of [[civil religion]], or the religion of a state. [[American civil religion]], for example, might be said to have its own set of sacred "things": the [[flag of the United States]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], etc. Other sociologists have taken Durkheim's concept of what religion is in the direction of the religion of professional sports, the military, or of rock music.

===Max Weber===
Max Weber published four major texts on religion in a context of [[economic sociology]] and his rationalization thesis: ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905), ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'' (1915), ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]'' (1915), and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'' (1920).

In his sociology, Weber uses the German term "[[Verstehen]]" to describe his method of interpretation of the intention and context of human action. Weber is not a [[positivism|positivist]]; he does not believe we can find out "facts" in sociology that can be causally linked. Although he believes some generalized statements about social life can be made, he is not interested in hard positivist claims, but instead in linkages and sequences, in historical narratives and particular cases.

Weber argues for making sense of religious action on its own terms. A religious group or individual is influenced by all kinds of things, he says, but if they claim to be acting in the name of religion, we should attempt to understand their [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] on religious grounds first. Weber gives religion credit for shaping a person's image of the world, and this image of the world can affect their view of their interests, and ultimately how they decide to take action.

For Weber, religion is best understood as it responds to the human need for [[theodicy]] and [[soteriology]]. Human beings are troubled, he says, with the question of theodicy – the question of how the extraordinary power of a [[divinity|divine]] god may be reconciled with the imperfection of the world that he has created and rules over. People need to know, for example, why there is undeserved good fortune and suffering in the world. Religion offers people soteriological answers, or answers that provide opportunities for [[salvation]] – relief from suffering, and reassuring meaning. The pursuit of salvation, like the pursuit of wealth, becomes a part of human [[motivation]].

Because religion helps to define motivation, Weber believed that religion (and specifically [[Calvinism]]) actually helped to give rise to modern capitalism, as he asserted in his most famous and controversial work, ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''.

In ''The Protestant Ethic'', Weber argues that capitalism arose in Europe in part because of how the [[belief]] in [[predestination]] was interpreted by everyday English [[Puritan]]s. Puritan theology was based on the Calvinist notion that not everyone would be saved; there was only a specific number of the elect who would avoid [[damnation]], and this was based sheerly on God's predetermined will and not on any action you could perform in this life. Official doctrine held that one could not ever really know whether one was among the elect.

Practically, Weber noted, this was difficult psychologically: people were (understandably) anxious to know whether they would be eternally damned or not. Thus Puritan leaders began assuring members that if they began doing well financially in their businesses, this would be one unofficial sign they had God's approval and were among the saved – but only if they used the fruits of their labour well. This along with the [[rationalism]] implied by [[monotheism]] led to the development of rational bookkeeping and the calculated pursuit of financial success beyond what one needed simply to live – and this is the "spirit of capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew McKinnon (2010) "Elective Affinities of the Protestant Ethic: Weber and the Chemistry of Capitalism" Sociological Theory vol 28 no. 1. pages 108–126. {{cite web |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818023547/http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the habits associated with the spirit of capitalism lost their religious significance, and the rational pursuit of [[Profit (economics)|profit]] became an aim in its own right.

''The Protestant Ethic'' thesis has been much critiqued, refined, and disputed, but is still a lively source of theoretical debate in sociology of religion. Weber also did considerable work on world religions, including [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].

In his ''magnum opus'' ''[[Economy and Society]]'' Weber distinguished three [[ideal type]]s of religious attitudes:&lt;ref&gt;Pawel Zaleski "Ideal Types in Max Weber's Sociology of Religion: Some Theoretical Inspirations for a Study of the Religious Field", ''Polish Sociological Review'' No. 3(171)/2010&lt;/ref&gt;
# world-flying mysticism
# world-rejecting asceticism
# inner-worldly asceticism.

He also separated [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] as pre-religious activity.

==Theoretical perspectives==

===Symbolic anthropology and phenomenology===
[[Symbolic anthropology]] and some versions of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] argue that all humans require reassurance that the world is safe and ordered place – that is, they have a need for [[ontological security]].&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1991). Modernity and self-identity: self and society in the late modern age, Cambridge, Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, all societies have forms of knowledge that perform this psychological task. The inability of science to offer psychological and emotional comfort explains the presence and influence of non-scientific knowledge in human lives, even in rational world.

===Functionalism===
Unlike [[symbolic anthropology]] and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] points to the benefits for social organization which non-scientific belief systems provide and which scientific knowledge fails to deliver. Belief systems are seen as encouraging social order and social stability in ways that rationally based knowledge cannot. From this perspective, the existence of non-rational accounts of reality can be explained by the benefits they offer to society.

According to functionalists, "religion serves several purposes, like providing answers to spiritual mysteries, offering emotional comfort, and creating a place for social interaction and social control. … One of the most important functions of religion, from a functionalist perspective, is the opportunities it creates for social interaction and the formation of groups. It provides social support and social networking, offering a place to meet others who hold similar values and a place to seek help (spiritual and material) in times of need."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://opentextbc.ca/introductiontosociology/chapter/chapter-15-religion/ |title=Religion |last=McGivern |first=Ron |date= |website=Introduction to Sociology – 1st Canadian Edition |publisher=BC Open Textbooks |access-date=2018-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationalism===
Rationalists object to the phenomenological and functionalist approaches, arguing that they fail to understand why believers in systems of non-scientific knowledge do think they tell the truth and that their ideas are right, even when science has shown them to be wrong. We cannot explain forms of knowledge in terms of the beneficial psychological or societal effects that an outside observer may see them as producing. We have to look at the point of view of those who believe in them. People do not believe in God, practice magic, or think that witches cause misfortune because they think they are providing themselves with psychological reassurance, or to achieve greater cohesion for their social groups. They do so because they think their beliefs are correct – that they tell them the truth about the way the world is.

Nineteenth-century rationalist writers, reflecting the evolutionist spirits of their times, tended to explain the lack of rationality and the dominance of false beliefs in pre-modern worlds in terms of the deficient mental equipment of their inhabitants. Such people were seen as possessing pre-logical, or non-rational, mentality. Twentieth-century rationalist thinking generally rejected such a view, reasoning that pre-modern people didn't possess inferior minds, but lacked the social and cultural conditions needed to promote rationalism. Rationalists see the history of modern societies as the rise of scientific knowledge and the subsequent decline of non-rational belief. Some of these beliefs, such as magic and [[witchcraft]], had disappeared, while others, such as religion, had become marginalized. This rationalist perspective has led to [[secularization]] theories of various kinds.&lt;ref name="Wilson1982" /&gt;

==Typology of religious groups==
{{Main|Sociological classifications of religious movements}}
One common typology among sociologists, religious groups are classified as [[ecclesia (sociology of religion)|ecclesias]], [[religious denomination|denominations]], [[sect]]s, or [[cult]]s (now more commonly referred to in scholarship as [[new religious movement]]s). Note that sociologists give these words precise definitions which differ from how they are commonly used. In particular, sociologists use the words 'cult' and 'sect' without negative connotations, even though the popular use of these words is often pejorative.&lt;ref&gt;

==Religiosity==
Some sociologists of religion explore the theoretical analysis of the sociological dimensions of [[religiosity]]. For example, [[Charles Y. Glock]] is best known for his five-dimensional scheme of the nature of religious commitment. His list consist of the following variables: [[religious belief|belief]], [[religious education|knowledge]], [[religious experience|experience]], [[practice (social theory)|practice]] (sometimes subdivided into private and public [[ritual]]) and [[consequences of religiosity|consequences]]. Glock's first four dimensions have proved widely useful in research, because generally, they are simple to measure survey research.&lt;ref name="hartsem.edu"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/glock.htm |chapter=Glock, Charles Young |title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Society |publisher=Hartford Institute for Religion Research |first=Armand L. |last=Mauss |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011221304/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/glock.htm |archivedate=2013-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glock, C. Y. (1972) ‘On the Study of Religious Commitment’ in J. E. Faulkner (ed.) Religion’s Influence in Contemporary Society, Readings in the Sociology of Religion, Ohio: Charles E. Merril: 38–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Mervin F. Verbit]]'s contribution was a twenty four-dimensional religiosity measure which includes measuring religiosity through six different "components" of religiosity: [[ritual]], [[doctrine]], [[emotion]], [[knowledge]], [[ethics]], [[community]], and along four dimensions: content, frequency, intensity, centrality.&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, M. F. (1970). The components and dimensions of religious behavior: Toward a reconceptualization of religiosity. American mosaic, 24, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Küçükcan, T. (2010).

==Secularization and civil religion==
{{Main|Secularization|Civil religion}}

In relation to the processes of rationalization associated with the development of [[modernity]], it was predicted in the works of many classical sociologists that religion would decline.&lt;ref name="Davie 2003 19"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davie|first=Grace|title=Predicting religion: Christian, Peculiar &amp; alternative Future|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0-7546-3010-4|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the claims of many classical theorists and sociologists immediately after [[World War II]], many contemporary theorists have critiqued secularization thesis, arguing that religion has continued to play a vital role in the lives of individuals worldwide. In the United States, in particular, [[church attendance]] has remained relatively stable in the past 40 years. In Africa, the emergence of [[Christianity in Africa|Christianity]] has occurred at a high rate. While Africa could claim roughly 10 million Christians in 1900, recent estimates put that number closer to 200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cragun|first=Ryan|title=Introduction To Sociology|year=2008|publisher=Seven Treasures Publications|isbn=978-0-9800707-7-4|pages=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rise of [[Islam]] as a major world religion, especially its new-found influence in the [[Western world|West]], is another significant development. {{citation needed span|text=Furthermore, arguments may be presented regarding the concept of civil religion and new world belief systems.|date=June 2018}} In short, presupposed secularization as a decline in religiosity might seem to be a myth, depending on its definition and the definition of its scope. For instance, some sociologists have argued that steady church attendance and personal religious belief may coexist with a decline in the influence of religious authorities on social or political issues. Additionally, regular attendance or affiliation do not necessarily translate into a behaviour according to their doctrinal teachings.

In other words, numbers of members might still be growing, but this does not mean that all members are faithfully following the rules of pious behaviours expected. In that sense, religion may be seen as declining because of its waning ability to influence behaviour.

===Religious economy===
According to [[Rodney Stark]], [[David Martin (sociologist)|David Martin]] was the first contemporary sociologist to reject the secularization theory outright. Martin even proposed that the concept of secularization be eliminated from social scientific discourse, on the grounds that it had only served ideological purposes and because there was no evidence of any general shift from a religious period in human affairs to a secular period.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney. "Secularization, R.I.P." ''Sociology of religion 60'', no. 3 (1999): 249–273.&lt;/ref&gt;
Stark is well known for pioneering, with [[William Sims Bainbridge]], a [[theory of religious economy]], according to which societies that restrict supply of religion, either through an imposed [[state religion|state religious monopoly]] or through state-sponsored secularization, are the main causes of drops in religiosity. Correspondingly, the more [[religion]]s a society has, the more likely the population is to be religious.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last= Stark |first= Rodney |authorlink= Rodney Stark |title= Sociology |edition= 10th |year= 2007 |publisher= Thomson Wadsworth |isbn= 0-495-09344-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicts the older view of secularization which states that if a liberal religious community is tolerant of a wide array of belief, then the population is less likely to hold certain beliefs in common, so nothing can be shared and reified in a community context, leading to a reduction in religious observance.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=Steve|title=Choice and Religion: A Critique of Rational Choice|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-829584-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peter Berger===
[[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]] observed that while researchers supporting the secularization theory have long maintained that religion must inevitably decline in the modern world, today, much of the world is as religious as ever. This points to the falsity of the secularization theory. On the other hand, Berger also notes that secularization may be indeed have taken hold in Europe, while the United States and other regions have continued to remain religious despite the increased modernity. Dr. Berger suggested that the reason for this may have to do with the education system; in Europe, teachers are sent by the educational authorities and European parents would have to put up with secular teaching, while in the United States, schools were for much of the time under local authorities, and American parents, however unenlightened, could fire their teachers. Berger also notes that unlike Europe, America has seen the rise of Evangelical Protestantism, or "born-again Christians".&lt;ref name=dawson11&gt;Dawson, Andrew. ''Sociology of Religion''. Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}}&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. "Reflections on the sociology of religion today." ''Sociology of Religion 62'', no. 4 (2001): 443–454.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. "Secularization and de-secularization." ''Religions in the modern world: Traditions and transformations 336'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bryan Wilson===
[[Bryan R. Wilson]] is a writer on secularization who is interested in the nature of life in a society dominated by scientific knowledge. His work is in the tradition of Max Weber, who saw modern societies as places in which rationality dominates life and thought. Weber saw rationality as concerned with identifying causes and working out technical efficiency, with a focus on how things work and with calculating how they can be made to work more effectively, rather than why they are as they are. According to Weber, such rational worlds are disenchanted. Existential questions about the mysteries of human existence, about who we are and why we are here, have become less and less significant.

Wilson&lt;ref name="Wilson1982"&gt;Wilson, Bryan (1982). Religion in Sociological Perspective, Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; insists that non-scientific systems – and religious ones in particular – have experienced an irreversible decline in influence. He has engaged in a long debate with those who dispute the secularization thesis, some of which argue that the traditional religions, such as church-centered ones, have become displaced by an abundance of non-traditional ones, such as cults and sects of various kinds. Others argue that religion has become an individual, rather than a collective, organized affair. Still others suggest that functional alternatives to traditional religion, such as nationalism and patriotism, have emerged to promote social solidarity. Wilson does accept the presence of a large variety of non-scientific forms of meaning and knowledge, but he argues that this is actually evidence of the decline of religion. The increase in the number and diversity of such systems is proof of the removal of religion from the central structural location that it occupied in pre-modern times.

===Ernest Gellner===
Unlike Wilson and Weber, [[Ernest Gellner]]&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1974). Legitimation of Belief, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; (1974) acknowledges that there are drawbacks to living in a world whose main form of knowledge is confined to facts we can do nothing about and that provide us with no guidelines on how to live and how to organize ourselves. In this regard, we are worse off than pre-modern people, whose knowledge, while incorrect, at least provided them with prescriptions for living. However, Gellner insists that these disadvantages are far outweighed by the huge technological advances modern societies have experienced as a result of the application of scientific knowledge.

Gellner doesn't claim that non-scientific knowledge is in the process of dying out. For example, he accepts that religions in various forms continue to attract adherents. He also acknowledges that other forms of belief and meaning, such as those provided by art, music, literature, popular culture (a specifically modern phenomenon), drug taking, political protest, and so on are important for many people. Nevertheless, he rejects the relativist interpretation of this situation – that in modernity, scientific knowledge is just one of many accounts of existence, all of which have equal validity. This is because, for Gellner, such alternatives to science are profoundly insignificant since they are technically impotent, as opposed to science. He sees that modern preoccupations with meaning and being as a self-indulgence that is only possible because scientific knowledge has enabled our world to advance so far. Unlike those in pre-modern times, whose overriding priority is to get hold of scientific knowledge in order to begin to develop, we can afford to sit back in the luxury of our well-appointed world and ponder upon such questions because we can take for granted the kind of world science has constructed for us.

===Michel Foucault===
[[Michel Foucault]] was a [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] who saw human existence as being dependent on forms of knowledge – discourses – that work like languages. Languages/discourses define reality for us. In order to think at all, we are obliged to use these definitions. The knowledge we have about the world is provided for us by the languages and discourses we encounter in the times and places in which we live our lives. Thus, who we are, what we know to be true, and what we think are discursively constructed.

Foucault defined history as the rise and fall of discourses. Social change is about changes in prevailing forms of knowledge. The job of the historian is to chart these changes and identify the reasons for them. Unlike rationalists, however, Foucault saw no element of progress in this process. To Foucault, what is distinctive about modernity is the emergence of discourses concerned with the control and regulation of the body. According to Foucault, the rise of body-centered discourses necessarily involved a process of secularization. Pre-modern discourses were dominated by religion, where things were defined as good and evil, and social life was centered around these concepts. With the emergence of modern urban societies, scientific discourses took over, and medical science was a crucial element of this new knowledge. Modern life became increasingly subject to medical control – the [[medical gaze]], as Foucault called it.

The rise to power of science, and of medicine in particular, coincided with a progressive reduction of the power of religious forms of knowledge. For example, normality and deviance became more of a matter of health and illness than of good and evil, and the physician took over from the priest the role of defining, promoting, and healing deviance.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel (1977). The Birth of the Clinic: an archaeology of medical perception, London, Tavistock&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other perspectives===

[[BBC News]] reported on a study by physicists and mathematicians that attempted to use mathematical modelling ([[nonlinear dynamics]]) to predict future religious orientations of populations. The study suggests that religion is headed towards "extinction" in various nations where it has been on the decline: Australia, Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Switzerland. The model considers not only the changing number of people with certain beliefs, but also attempts to assign utility values of a belief in each nation.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12811197|title='Extinction threat' to religion|first=Jason|last=Palmer|date=22 March 2011|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422050308/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12811197|archivedate=22 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1012.1375|title=A mathematical model of social group competition with application to the growth of religious non-affiliation|first1=Daniel M.|last1=Abrams|first2=Haley A.|last2=Yaple|first3=Richard J.|last3=Wiener|date=16 August 2011|publisher=|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=107|issue=8|accessdate=|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.088701|bibcode=2011PhRvL.107h8701A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Luckmann]] maintains that the sociology of religion should cease preoccupations with the traditional and institutionalized forms of religion. Luckmann points instead to the "religious problem" which is the "problem of individual existence." This is the case as with the advent of modernity, religious meaning making has shifted more into the individual domain.&lt;ref name=dawson11/&gt;{{rp|82}}

==Globalization==

The sociology of religion continues to grow throughout the world, attempting to understand the relationship between religion and [[globalization]]. Two older approaches to globalization include [[modernization theory]], a functionalist derivative, and [[world-systems theory]], a Marxist approach. One of the differences between these theories is whether they view [[capitalism]] as positive or problematic. However, both assumed that [[modernization]] and capitalism would diminish the hold of religion.

To the contrary, as globalization intensified many different cultures started to look into different religions and incorporate different beliefs into society.&lt;ref name="Davie 2003 19"/&gt; New interpretations emerged that recognize the tensions. For example, according to [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and [[Peter Mandaville]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion and globalization have been intertwined with each other since the early empires attempted to extend their reach across what they perceived to be world-space. Processes of globalization carried religious cosmologies – including traditional conceptions of universalism – to the corners of the world, while these cosmologies legitimated processes of globalization. This dynamic of inter-relation has continued to the present, but with changing and sometimes new and intensifying contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2010 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Mandaville | first2= Peter | title= Globalization and Culture, Vol. 2: Globalizing Religions | url= https://www.academia.edu/4416072/Globalization_and_Culture_Vol._2_Globalizing_Religions_editor_with_Peter_Mandaville_Sage_Publications_London_2010 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swiss Seismological Service'''  ({{lang-de|Schweizerischer Erdbebendienst}}, {{lang-fr|Service sismologique suisse}}, {{lang-it|Servizio sismico svizzero}}, {{lang-rm|Servizi da terratrembels svizzer}})  at [[ETH Zurich]] is the federal agency responsible for monitoring [[earthquakes]] in Switzerland and its neighboring countries and for assessing Switzerland’s seismic hazard. When an earthquake happens, the SED informs the public, authorities, and the media about the earthquake’s location, magnitude, and possible consequences. The activities of the SED are integrated in the [http://www.bafu.admin.ch/naturgefahren/14806/14961/index.html?lang=de federal action plan for earthquake precaution].

== History ==
The beginnings of the SED trace back to the establishment of the Erdbebenkommission in 1878. In 1914, the earthquake monitoring mandate was defined in a federal law. Thus, what had been a voluntary activity was transformed into an institution. In its present form as a nondepartmental unit of ETH Zurich, the SED has been in existence since 2009.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/about-us/portrait/history/|title=History Swiss Seismological Service |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earthquake monitoring ==
More than 150 seismic monitoring stations installed and serviced by the SED constantly monitor earthquake activity in Switzerland and its neighboring countries. The processing center in Zurich acquires data recorded in Switzerland from two different sources:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/earthquakes/monitoring/|title=Earthquake Monitoring Switzerland |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Swiss National Network (CHNet) consisting of both the Swiss Digital Seismic Network (SDSNet) and the Swiss Strong Motion Network (SSMNet), mainly using broadband seismometers to register weak local, moderate regional and moderate to strong global earthquakes as well as accelerometers to register moderate and strong local earthquakes.
* Special networks (often temporary) in order to monitor increased natural seismic activity, do aftershock deployments, monitor geothermal exploration, support research and educational projects (e.g. AlpArray and seismo@school), or industry projects by third-party assignment.

== Earthquake hazard in Switzerland ==
In comparison with other European countries Switzerland faces a medium seismic hazard, but there are regional differences: In Valais, Basel, the St. Gallen Rhine Valley, Mittelbünden, the Engadine, and Central Switzerland more earthquakes are registered than in other regions. However, earthquakes may occur anytime and anywhere in Switzerland. &lt;br&gt;
A strong earthquake with a magnitude of approximately 6 occurs every 50 to 100 years on average. The last time an earthquake of such magnitude was recorded was in 1946 near Sierre in Valais.&lt;br&gt;
The strongest earthquake in Switzerland so far had a magnitude of approximately 6.6 and destroyed large parts of the city of Basel in 1356. If such an earthquake were to occur in Basel today, several thousand fatalities, tens of thousands of seriously and slightly injured people, and property damage on the order of approximately CHF 140 billion could be expected.&lt;br&gt;
The best protection measures against the effects of an earthquake are an earthquake-resistant building design and securing objects that may topple. 90 percent of the buildings in Switzerland are not built to a seismic code, and it is not clear to what extent they could withstand a strong earthquake. Only few cantons have statutory regulations requiring adherence to construction standards for earthquake-resistant building.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/knowledge/seismic-hazard-switzerland/|title=Earthquake hazard and risk |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/knowledge/earthquake-country-switzerland/historical-earthquakes/basel-1356/|title=Scenario Earthquake Basel |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alert in case of an earthquake ==
Earthquakes can neither be predicted nor prevented. However, the SED records the ground tremors around the clock. Within approximately 90 seconds details about the time, location, magnitude, and possible effects of an earthquake are displayed on the website www.seismo.ethz.ch.&lt;br&gt;
The SED automatically reports any noticeable earthquakes to the authorities and the media. At the same time, this information is transmitted to the SED’s 24-hour on-call service via pager, e-mail, and SMS. This service is also available to the authorities and the media for further information about current earthquakes, and prepares background information that is published on the website.&lt;br&gt;
In case of earthquakes that cause major damage worldwide, the SED additionally informs the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit (SHA).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/earthquakes/alerting/|title=Warning |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and teaching ==
Besides earthquake monitoring and the assessment of seismic hazard, the researchers of the SED are involved in numerous national and international research projects, which are largely financed by third parties. This guarantees the permanent exchange of information across national borders. Fields in which the SED researchers are involved include, for example, glacial and engineering seismology, static seismology, induced seismic activity, as well as the monitoring of landslides and seismotectonics. The training of junior researchers also plays an important role for the SED. This is done with lectures and seminars that are integral parts of the teaching program at ETH, as well as through the supervision of master’s and doctoral theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/research-and-teaching/fields_of_research/|title=Research and Teaching |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nuclear-test-ban treaty monitoring ==
In 1996, the UN countries decided to draft an agreement on the ban of nuclear tests. An international monitoring system was established to control the adherence to this agreement. The SED contributes by supplying the authority in charge in Vienna with data recorded by the seismic station in the Davos region, which was constructed for exactly this purpose. For example, the seismic station already recorded the corresponding ground shaking twelve minutes after the nuclear test in North Korea in 2013.

In this process, a mixture of [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], and [[carbon dioxide]], known as [[syngas]], is used as [[carbon]] and [[energy]] sources, and then converted into [[fuel]] and [[chemicals]] by [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The main products of syngas [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] include [[ethanol]], [[butanol]], [[acetic acid]], [[butyric acid]], and [[methane]].&lt;ref name="Worden"&gt;Worden, R.M., Bredwell, M.D., and Grethlein, A.J.

Certain industrial processes, such as petroleum refining, steel milling, and methods for producing [[carbon black]], [[Petroleum coke|coke]], [[ammonia]], and [[methanol]], discharge enormous amounts of waste gases containing mainly CO and {{chem|H|2}} into the atmosphere either directly or through combustion. Biocatalysts can be exploited to convert these waste gases to chemicals and fuels as, for example, ethanol.&lt;ref name="Abubackar"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/bbb.256 | last1 = Abubackar | first1 = H.N. | last2 = Veiga | first2 = M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19901">In [[mathematics]], a '''t-norm''' (also '''T-norm''' or, unabbreviated, '''triangular norm''') is a kind of [[binary operation]] used in the framework of [[probabilistic metric space]]s and in [[multi-valued logic]], specifically in [[fuzzy logic]]. A t-norm generalizes [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] in a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] and [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] in [[logic]]. The name ''triangular norm'' refers to the fact that in the framework of probabilistic metric spaces t-norms are used to generalize [[triangle inequality]] of ordinary [[metric space]]s.

== Definition ==

A t-norm is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] T: [0,&amp;nbsp;1] &amp;times; [0,&amp;nbsp;1] → [0,&amp;nbsp;1] which satisfies the following properties:
* [[Commutativity]]: T(''a'', ''b'') = T(''b'', ''a'')
* [[Monotonicity]]: T(''a'', ''b'') ≤ T(''c'', ''d'') if ''a'' ≤ ''c'' and ''b'' ≤ ''d''
* [[Associativity]]: T(''a'', T(''b'', ''c'')) = T(T(''a'', ''b''), ''c'')
* The number 1 acts as [[identity element]]: T(''a'', 1) = ''a''

Since a t-norm is a [[binary operation|binary algebraic operation]] on the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1], infix algebraic notation is also common, with the t-norm usually denoted by&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;.

The defining conditions of the t-norm are exactly those of the partially ordered Abelian monoid on the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. '' (Cf.&amp;nbsp;[[ordered group]].)'' The monoidal operation of any partially ordered Abelian monoid ''L'' is therefore by some authors called a ''triangular norm on L''.

=== Motivations and applications ===

T-norms are a generalization of the usual two-valued [[logical conjunction]], studied by classical logic, for [[fuzzy logic]]s. Indeed, the classical Boolean conjunction is both commutative and associative. The monotonicity property ensures that the [[degree of truth]] of conjunction does not decrease if the [[truth value]]s of conjuncts increase. The requirement that 1 be an identity element corresponds to the interpretation of 1 as ''true'' (and consequently 0 as ''false''). Continuity, which is often required from fuzzy conjunction as well, expresses the idea that, roughly speaking, very small changes in truth values of conjuncts should not macroscopically affect the truth value of their conjunction.

T-norms are also used to construct the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of [[fuzzy set]]s or as a basis for aggregation operators (see [[fuzzy set operations]]). In [[probabilistic metric space]]s, t-norms are used to generalize [[triangle inequality]] of ordinary metric spaces. Individual t-norms may of course frequently occur in further disciplines of mathematics, since the class contains many familiar functions.

=== Classification of t-norms ===

A t-norm is called ''continuous'' if it is [[continuous function|continuous]] as a function, in the usual interval topology on [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. (Similarly for ''left-'' and ''right-continuity''.)

A t-norm is called ''strict'' if it is continuous and [[monotonic function|strictly monotone]].

A t-norm is called ''nilpotent'' if it is continuous and each ''x'' in the open interval (0,&amp;nbsp;1) is its [[nilpotent]] element, i.e., there is a natural number ''n'' such that ''x'' &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' (''n''&amp;nbsp;times) equals&amp;nbsp;0.

A t-norm &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is called ''Archimedean'' if it has the [[Archimedean property]], i.e., if for each ''x'', ''y'' in the open interval (0,&amp;nbsp;1) there is a natural number ''n'' such that ''x'' &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' (''n''&amp;nbsp;times) is less than or equal to ''y''.

The usual partial ordering of t-norms is pointwise, i.e.,
: T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp; if &amp;nbsp; T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'') ≤ T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'') for all ''a'', ''b'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].
As functions, pointwise larger t-norms are sometimes called ''stronger'' than those pointwise smaller. In the semantics of fuzzy logic, however, the larger a t-norm, the ''weaker'' (in terms of logical strength) conjunction it represents.

*'''Minimum t-norm''' &lt;math&gt;\top_{\mathrm{min}}(a, b) = \min \{a, b\},&lt;/math&gt; also called the '''Gödel t-norm''', as it is the standard semantics for conjunction in [[Gödel fuzzy logic]]. Besides that, it occurs in most t-norm based fuzzy logics as the standard semantics for weak conjunction.

*'''Łukasiewicz t-norm''' &lt;math&gt;\top_{\mathrm{Luk}}(a, b) = \max \{0, a+b-1\}.&lt;/math&gt; The name comes from the fact that the t-norm is the standard semantics for strong conjunction in [[Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic]]. It is a nilpotent Archimedean t-norm, pointwise smaller than the product t-norm.

    \frac{ab}{a+b-ab} &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:is a strict Archimedean t-norm, and an important representative of the parametric classes of [[Construction of t-norms#Hamacher t-norms|Hamacher t-norms]] and [[Construction of t-norms#Schweizer–Sklar t-norms|Schweizer–Sklar t-norms]].

==Properties of t-norms==

The drastic t-norm is the pointwise smallest t-norm and the minimum is the pointwise largest t-norm:
:&lt;math&gt;\top_{\mathrm{D}}(a, b)  \le \top(a, b) \le \mathrm{\top_{min}}(a, b),&lt;/math&gt; for any t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; and all ''a'', ''b'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

For every t-norm T, the number 0 acts as null element: T(''a'', 0) = 0 for all ''a'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

A t-norm T has [[zero divisor]]s if and only if it has [[nilpotent element|nilpotent]] elements; each nilpotent element of T is also a zero divisor of T. The set of all nilpotent elements is an interval [0,&amp;nbsp;''a''] or [0,&amp;nbsp;''a''), for some ''a'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

=== Properties of continuous t-norms ===

Although real functions of two variables can be continuous in each variable without being continuous on [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, this is not the case with t-norms: a t-norm T is continuous if and only if it is continuous in one variable, i.e., if and only if the functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') = T(''x'', ''y'') are continuous for each ''y'' in  [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Analogous theorems hold for left- and right-continuity of a t-norm.

A continuous t-norm is Archimedean if and only if 0 and 1 are its only [[idempotent]]s.

A continuous Archimedean t-norm is strict if 0 is its only [[nilpotent]] element; otherwise it is nilpotent. By definition, moreover, a continuous Archimedean t-norm T is nilpotent if and only if ''each'' ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1 is a nilpotent element of T. Thus with a continuous Archimedean t-norm T, either all or none of the elements of (0,&amp;nbsp;1) are nilpotent. If it is the case that all elements in (0,&amp;nbsp;1) are nilpotent, then the t-norm is isomorphic to the Łukasiewicz t-norm; i.e., there is a strictly increasing function ''f'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;\top(x,y) = f^{-1}(\top_{\mathrm{Luk}}(f(x), f(y))).&lt;/math&gt;
If on the other hand it is the case that there are no nilpotent elements of T, the t-norm is isomorphic to the product t-norm. In other words, all nilpotent t-norms are isomorphic, the Łukasiewicz t-norm being their prototypical representative; and all strict t-norms are isomorphic, with the product t-norm as their prototypical example. The Łukasiewicz t-norm is itself isomorphic to the product t-norm undercut at 0.25, i.e., to the function ''p''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') = max(0.25, ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;''y'') on [0.25,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

For each continuous t-norm, the set of its idempotents is a closed subset of [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Its complement — the set of all elements which are not idempotent — is therefore a union of countably many non-overlapping open intervals. The restriction of the t-norm to any of these intervals (including its endpoints) is Archimedean, and thus isomorphic either to the Łukasiewicz t-norm or the product t-norm. For such ''x'', ''y'' that do not fall into the same open interval of non-idempotents, the t-norm evaluates to the minimum of ''x'' and ''y''. These conditions actually give a characterization of continuous t-norms, called the '''Mostert–Shields theorem''', since every continuous t-norm can in this way be decomposed, and the described construction always yields a continuous t-norm. The theorem can also be formulated as follows:
:A t-norm is continuous if and only if it is isomorphic to an [[Construction of t-norms#Ordinal sums|ordinal sum]] of the minimum, Łukasiewicz, and product t-norm.

A similar characterization theorem for non-continuous t-norms is not known (not even for left-continuous ones), only some non-exhaustive methods for the [[construction of t-norms]] have been found.

== Residuum ==

For any left-continuous t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique binary operation &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; on [0,&amp;nbsp;1] such that
:&lt;math&gt;\top(z, x) \le y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;z \le (x \Rightarrow y)&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This operation is called the ''residuum'' of the t-norm. In prefix notation, the residuum to a t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; is often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\vec{\top}&lt;/math&gt; or by the letter R.

The interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] equipped with a t-norm and its residuum forms a [[residuated lattice]]. The relation between a t-norm T and its residuum R is an instance of [[adjoint functors#Posets|adjunction]] (specifically, a [[Galois connection]]): the residuum forms a right adjoint R(''x'', –) to the functor T(–, ''x'') for each ''x'' in the lattice [0,&amp;nbsp;1] taken as a [[poset]] category.

In the standard semantics of t-norm based fuzzy logics, where conjunction is interpreted by a t-norm, the residuum plays the role of implication (often called ''R-implication'').

=== Basic properties of residua ===

If &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is the residuum of a left-continuous t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;(x \Rightarrow y) = \sup\{z\mid\top(z,x) \le y\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently, for all ''x'', ''y'' in the unit interval,
:&lt;math&gt;(x \Rightarrow y) = 1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x \le y&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;(1 \Rightarrow y) = y.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is a left-continuous t-norm and &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; its residuum, then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
  \min(x,y)  &amp; \ge &amp; x * (x \Rightarrow y) \\
  \max(x, y) &amp; =   &amp; \min((x \Rightarrow y)\Rightarrow y, (y \Rightarrow x)\Rightarrow x).
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, then equality holds in the former.

=== Residua of prominent left-continuous t-norms ===

If ''x'' ≤ ''y'', then R(''x'', ''y'') = 1 for any residuum R. The following table therefore gives the values of prominent residua only for ''x'' &amp;gt; ''y''.

== T-conorms ==

'''T-conorms''' (also called '''S-norms''') are dual to t-norms under the order-reversing operation which assigns 1&amp;nbsp;– ''x'' to ''x'' on [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Given a t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;, the complementary conorm is defined by
: &lt;math&gt;\bot(a,b) = 1-\top(1-a, 1-b).&lt;/math&gt;
This generalizes [[De Morgan's laws]].

It follows that a t-conorm satisfies the following conditions, which can be used for an equivalent axiomatic definition of t-conorms independently of t-norms:
* Commutativity: ⊥(''a'', ''b'') = ⊥(''b'', ''a'')
* Monotonicity: ⊥(''a'', ''b'') ≤ ⊥(''c'', ''d'') if ''a'' ≤ ''c'' and ''b'' ≤ ''d''
* Associativity: ⊥(''a'', ⊥(''b'', ''c'')) = ⊥(⊥(''a'', ''b''), ''c'')
* Identity element: ⊥(''a'', 0) = ''a''

T-conorms are used to represent [[logical disjunction]] in [[fuzzy logic]] and [[union (set theory)|union]] in [[fuzzy set theory]].

===Examples of t-conorms===

Important t-conorms are those dual to prominent t-norms:

[[File:MaximumTconorm-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the maximum t-conorm (3D and contours)]]
*'''Maximum t-conorm''' &lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{max}}(a, b) = \max \{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt;, dual to the minimum t-norm, is the smallest t-conorm (see the [[#Properties of t-conorms|properties of t-conorms]] below). It is the standard semantics for disjunction in [[Gödel fuzzy logic]] and for weak disjunction in all t-norm based fuzzy logics.

[[File:ProbabilisticSum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the probabilistic sum]]
*'''Probabilistic sum''' &lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{sum}}(a, b) = a + b - a \cdot b&lt;/math&gt; is dual to the product t-norm. In [[probability theory]] it expresses the probability of the union of independent [[event (probability theory)|event]]s. It is also the standard semantics for strong disjunction in such extensions of [[product fuzzy logic]] in which it is definable (e.g., those containing involutive negation).

[[File:BoundedSum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the bounded sum t-conorm]]
*'''Bounded sum''' &lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{Luk}}(a, b) = \min \{a+b, 1\}&lt;/math&gt; is dual to the Łukasiewicz t-norm. It is the standard semantics for strong disjunction in [[Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic]].

[[File:DrasticTconorm-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the drastic t-conorm. The function is discontinuous at the lines 1 &amp;gt; ''x'' = 0 and 1 &amp;gt; ''y'' = 0.]]
*'''Drastic t-conorm'''
::&lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{D}}(a, b) = \begin{cases}
  b &amp; \mbox{if }a=0 \\
  a &amp; \mbox{if }b=0 \\
  1 &amp; \mbox{otherwise,}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:dual to the drastic t-norm, is the largest t-conorm (see the [[#Properties of t-conorms|properties of t-conorms]] below).

[[File:NilpotentMaximum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the nilpotent maximum. The function is discontinuous at the line 0 &amp;lt; ''x'' = 1 – ''y'' &amp;lt; 1.]]
*'''Nilpotent maximum''', dual to the nilpotent minimum:
::&lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{nM}}(a, b) = \begin{cases}
    \max(a,b) &amp; \mbox{if }a+b &lt; 1 \\
    1         &amp; \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:EinsteinSum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the Einstein sum]]
*'''Einstein sum''' (compare the [[velocity-addition formula]] under special relativity)
::&lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{H}_2}(a, b) = \frac{a+b}{1+ab}&lt;/math&gt;
:is a dual to one of the [[Construction of t-norms#Hamacher t-norms|Hamacher t-norms]].

===Properties of t-conorms===

Many properties of t-conorms can be obtained by dualizing the properties of t-norms, for example:
* For any t-conorm ⊥, the number 1 is an annihilating element: ⊥(''a'', 1) = 1, for any ''a'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].
* Dually to t-norms, all t-conorms are bounded by the maximum and the drastic t-conorm:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\bot_{max}}(a, b) \le \bot(a, b) \le \bot_{\mathrm{D}}(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;, for any t-conorm &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; and all ''a'', ''b'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

Further properties result from the relationships between t-norms and t-conorms or their interplay with other operators, e.g.:
* A t-norm T [[distributivity|distributes]] over a t-conorm ⊥, i.e.,
::T(''x'', ⊥(''y'', ''z'')) = ⊥(T(''x'', ''y''), T(''x'', ''z'')) for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1],
:if and only if ⊥ is the maximum t-conorm. Dually, any t-conorm distributes over the minimum, but not over any other t-norm.

===Non-standard negators===

A '''negator''' &lt;math&gt;n:[0,1] \to [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Monotonic function#Monotonicity in functional analysis|monotonous]] falling, i. e. order-reversion mapping with &lt;math&gt;n(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n(1) = 0&lt;/math&gt; (in other notation: &lt;math&gt;0 \mapsto 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 \mapsto 0&lt;/math&gt;). 
A negator n is called
* '''strict''' in case of strict monotonocity 
* '''strong''' if it is strict and involutive (see: [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]): [[Universal quantification#notation|&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;]] &lt;math&gt;x \in [0,1]: n(n(x)) = x&lt;/math&gt;.
The standard (canonical) negator is 
&lt;math&gt;n(x) = 1 - x, x \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;, 
which appears to be strong. As the standard negator is used in the above definition of a t-norm/t-conorm pair, this can be generalized as follows:

A '''De Morgan Triplet''' is a triple (T,⊥,n) [[iff]] (if and only if)
# T is a t-norm
# ⊥ is a t-conorm according to the axiomatic definition of t-conorms as mentioned above
# n is a strong negator
# &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b \in [0, 1]: \,n(\perp(a, b)) = T(n(a), n(b))&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Reading}}
 
"[[Phonics]]" emphasizes the [[alphabetic principle]] – the idea that letters represent the sounds of speech, and that there are systematic and predictable relationships between written letters and spoken words, which is specific to the [[alphabetic]] [[writing system]] Children learn letter sounds (b = the first sound in "bat" and "ball") first and then blend them (bl = the first two sounds in "blue") to form words.  Children also learn how to segment and chunk letter sounds together in order to blend them to form words (trap = /t/, /r/, /a/, /p/ or /tr/, /ap/).  

"[[Whole language]]" is a [[Reading education|method of teaching reading]] that emphasizes literature and text comprehension. Students are taught to use critical thinking strategies and to use context to "guess" words that they do not recognize. In the younger grades, children use invented spelling to write their own stories. 

Both instructional methods use elements that are emphasized in the other; the differences between the methods are largely related to what is emphasized and the sequence of skill instruction.

==Phonics==
{{Main|Phonics}}

Phonics is seen to be an improvement  used method of learning the approximate [[phoneme|sounds]] represented by [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s (b=buh) first and then blending them with other sounds (bl=bluh) to decode and encode words in written form. This newer method attempts to eliminate the extraneous "uh" sounds which were unavoidable in the older method. Children also learn strategies to figure out words they don't know. 

Phonics is considered an "analytical" approach where students analyze the letters, letter combinations and syllables in a word; in an effort to "decode" (1) the speech-sounds represented by the letters and (2) the meaning of the text. The advantage of phonics is that, especially for students who come to schools with large English vocabularies, it enables students to decode or "sound-out" a word they have in their speaking vocabulary. 

Phonics proponents led by [[Rudolf Flesch]] in his book ''Why Johnny Can't Read'' attacked the whole word approach because (1) it did not get students into reading children's stories that did not have carefully controlled vocabularies and (2) it theoretically required the students to memorize every word as a whole. 

Phonics advocates focus their efforts on the primary grades and emphasize the importance of students having [[phonemic awareness]], that is an understanding of the alphabetic principle that the spelling of words relates to how they sound when spoken. 

A problem with teaching the reading of English with this analytical approach is that English words do not have a one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship. If they did have a one-to-one relationship, reading would be easier.  In general, with a few common exceptions, the [[consonant]]s do have a one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship but the [[vowel]]s do not. For instance the letter "a" represents one sound in the word "s'''a'''y", a second sound in "'''a'''t", a third sound in "'''a'''ny", a fourth sound in "'''a'''re", a fifth sound in "'''a'''ll", a sixth sound in "'''a'''bout", a seventh sound in "f'''a'''ther", an eighth sound in "or'''a'''nge", and a ninth sound (silence) in "bre'''a'''d". The speech-sounds are sometimes influenced by (a) the letters surrounding the target vowel, (b) by the sentence containing the word and (c) the stress, or lack thereof, given to the syllable containing the letter. 

Almost any combination of three letters with a central "a" can reasonably be pronounced in a number of different ways. For instance the "a" in "pag" could be pronounced as in "page" (long "a"), "pageant" (short "a"), creepage (short "i") or decoupage (short "o" as in "dot"). It therefore follows that beginning students will have a difficult time picking the appropriate sound when sounding-out words which are not in their speaking vocabularies.

Fortunately, most readers quickly develop a subconscious word sense which helps them fluently pick the right sound based on the structure of the word and how that structure is related to other similar words they know.

Some very common words do not fully follow common phonic patterns, so those words have to be memorized. Some books refer to these words as "[[sight word]]s", but it is probably better to refer to them as "memory words" because some books refer to sight words as those words which are so common they do not have to be analyzed or "sounded-out". It does not seem like a good idea to have "sight-words" mean two different things when "memory-words" is available.

The many [[homonym]]s in English such as ''to'', ''too'', and ''two'' create difficulties for students, even at the university level in regard to spelling. 

'''Drawbacks''': 
*For those who learn to speak by learning the whole sound of a word, phonics is not an ideal form of reading instruction, because these learners do not naturally break words into separate sounds.
*Some phonics programs use low-interest reading material and too many boring worksheets. Those "drawbacks", of course, are not unique to a phonics program.

==Whole language==
{{Main|Whole language}}

'''Whole language''' is a currently controversial approach to teaching reading that is based on constructivist learning theory and ethnographic studies of students in classrooms. With whole language, teachers are expected to provide a literacy rich environment for their students and to combine [[Speech communication|speaking]], [[listening]], [[reading (activity)|reading]], and [[writing]]. Whole language teachers emphasize the meaning of texts over the sounds of letters, and phonics instruction becomes just one component of the whole language classroom. 
Whole language is considered a "[[wikt:top-down|top down]]" approach where the reader constructs a personal meaning for a text based on using their prior knowledge to interpret the meaning of what they are reading.

'''Drawbacks''': 
*Some whole language programs place too little emphasis on word analysis. When that is left out, young readers may guess or skip over words they don't know and some children may not learn how to read.
*Some scholars have estimated that a whole-word memorization approach puts severe limitations on the number of words that children can learn to read.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diane McGuinness|McGuinness, Diane]].

Students who come from "high literacy" households—where young children are read bedtime stories on a regular basis, there are lots of children's books, and adults read regularly—tend to learn to read well regardless of the teaching approach used. These students tend to enter school with large vocabularies and reading readiness skills (and sometimes they already can read). 

Students from "low literacy" households are not exposed much to reading in their homes and tend to have smaller vocabularies. They may speak non-standard dialects of English such as [[African American Vernacular English]] and can be unmotivated students, especially if they see teachers as enemies trying to change how they speak and act, in other words their language and culture. It can be argued that a standard phonics approach might be unsuccessful for these students. Whole language approaches encourage teachers to find reading material that reflects these students' language and culture. Using culturally relevant material within classrooms may assist to engage these students in their reading. In addition, knowing students and how they learn will assist as topics of interest can be incorporated into their reading material for added motivation.

Publishing basal reading textbooks is a multimillion dollar industry that responds to the demands of purchasers. Two populous states, California and Texas, do statewide adoptions of textbooks, and whatever they want in their textbooks, publishers tend to supply. Currently publishers are including systematic phonics instruction (see [[synthetic phonics]]), more classic and popular children's literature, and whole language activities. This compromise generally goes under the rubric of a "balanced approach" to teaching reading. Advocates of balanced reading instruction should supplement a school's adopted reading program with materials that reflect the experiential background and interests of their students. 

Various approaches to reading presume that students learn differently. The phonics emphasis in reading draws heavily from behaviorist learning theory that is associated with the work of the Harvard psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]] while the whole language emphasis draws from cognitivist learning theory and the work of the Russian psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]]. 

Behaviorist learning theory is based on studies of animal behaviors where animals such as pigeons learned to do tasks when they received rewards and extinguished (stopped) behaviors that were not rewarded or were punished. Most of us can point to things we continue to do because we are rewarded for doing them. Rewards can be the pay we get for jobs we do, desired recognition like "A" grades for doing excellent school work, and praise from our friends when they like what we are doing. Likewise, we can point to things we stopped doing because we were not rewarded or were punished for them. Behaviorist learning theory tends to look at extrinsic rewards like money, grades, and gold stars rather than intrinsic rewards like feeling good about successfully accomplishing a difficult task. 

Cognitivist learning theory is based on the idea that children learn by connecting new knowledge to previously learned knowledge. The term is a building metaphor that includes students using scaffolding to organize new information. If children cannot connect new knowledge to old knowledge in a meaningful way, they may with difficulty memorize it ([[rote learning]]), but they will not have a real understanding of what they are learning. 

Vygotsky identified a '''"[[zone of proximal development]]"''' where children can learn new things that are a little above their current understanding with the help of more knowledgeable peers or adults. This new knowledge is incorporated into their existing knowledge base.
