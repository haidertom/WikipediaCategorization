'''''A Fictional Guide to Scotland''''' is a collection of [[short stories]] and one [[poem]] from 17 writers who were either [[Scottish people|Scottish]] by birth or lived in [[Scotland]] at the time of submission.  The pieces which made it into the book were selected through an anonymous submissions process with an [[OpenInk]] editor Elizabeth Reeder and guest editors, [[Meaghan Delahunt]] and [[Suhayl Saadi]], choosing the final pieces.

OpenInk was a group of Glasgow-based writers who came together out of a desire to create publications which offered writers and readers a unique experience. The OpenInk Editorial board was entirely voluntary. One of the editors was a full-time writer working both on her own writing and as a writer in residence in Glasgow. The remaining editors worked by day in a range of professions and wrote in their spare time.

The publication of the book was supported by a grant from [[Glasgow City Council]].  In addition, the editors raised a substantial amount of the money required for the project through sponsorship from friends and family.

In addition to the book, OpenInk ran a reading tour entitled ''A Fictional Guide to Scotland''. This reading tour visited places as far and wide as [[Wigtown]], [[Ullapool]], [[Inverness]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Stirling]], [[Lanark]] and [[Glasgow]] and was supported by the [[Scottish Arts Council]].

'''''Along the River During the Qingming Festival''''', also known by its [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name as the '''''Qingming Shanghe Tu''''', is a painting by the [[Song dynasty]] artist [[Zhang Zeduan]] (1085–1145). It captures the daily life of people and the landscape of the capital, Bianjing (present-day [[Kaifeng]]) during the [[Northern Song]]. The theme is often said to celebrate the festive spirit and worldly commotion at the [[Qingming Festival]], rather than the holiday's ceremonial aspects, such as [[ancestral veneration|tomb sweeping and prayers]]. Successive scenes reveal the lifestyle of all levels of the society from rich to poor as well as different economic activities in rural areas and the city, and offer glimpses of period clothing and architecture.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt;  The painting is considered to be the most renowned work among all [[Chinese painting]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christ to Coke: How Image Becomes Icon|author =[[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Kemp, Martin]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-161988-5|page=8|quote=...an image-making society second to none before the nineteenth century, the most famous painting is ''Qingming shanghe tu'' (''Along the River During the Qing Ming Festival'' or ''Spring Festival on the River'') by Zhang Zeduan, an artist working in the eleventh to twelfth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wallech/&gt;&lt;ref name=tnm/&gt; and it has been called "China's ''[[Mona Lisa]]''."&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/03/arts/design/03pain.html?_r=2|title=‘China’s Mona Lisa’ Makes a Rare Appearance in Hong Kong|author =Bradsher, Keith|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=July 3, 2007|accessdate=July 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an artistic creation, the piece has been revered and court artists of subsequent dynasties made re-interpretive versions, each following the overall composition and the theme of the original but differing in details and technique.&lt;ref name="Doar " &gt;Bruce Doar, "International Conference on Qingming Shanghe Tu and Song Dynasty Genre Paintings, Beijing, 10–12 October 2005.," ''China Heritage Newsletter, China Heritage Project ''4 (December 2005) [http://www.chinaheritagequarterly.org/scholarship.php?searchterm=004_qingmingconf.inc&amp;issue=004]&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the centuries, the Qingming scroll was collected and kept among numerous private owners, before it eventually returned to public ownership. The painting was a particular favorite of [[Puyi]], the Last Emperor, who took the Song dynasty original with him when he left Beijing. It was re-purchased in 1945 and kept at the Palace Museum in the [[Forbidden City]]. The Song dynasty original and the Qing versions, in the Beijing and Taipei Palace Museums respectively, are regarded as national treasures and are exhibited only for brief periods every few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/01/11/melvin_ed3_.php|title=A rare peek at China's treasures|author =Melvin, Sheila|publisher=''International Herald Tribune''|date=January 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The countryside and the densely populated city are the two main sections in the picture, with the river meandering through the entire length. The right section is the rural area of the city. There are crop fields and unhurried rural folk—predominately farmers, goatherds, and pig herders—in bucolic scenery. A country path broadens into a road and joins with the city road. The left half is the urban area, which eventually leads into the city proper with the gates. Many economic activities, such as people loading cargoes onto the boat, shops, and even a tax office, can be seen in this area. People from all walks of life are depicted: peddlers, jugglers, actors, paupers begging, monks asking for alms, fortune tellers and seers, doctors, innkeepers, teachers, millers, metalworkers, carpenters, masons, and official scholars from all ranks.
[[File:清明上河图.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The bridge scene where the crew of an oncoming boat have not yet fully lowered their sails and are in danger of crashing into the bridge]]

Outside the city proper (separated by the gate to the left), there are businesses of all kinds, selling wine, grain, secondhand goods, cookware, bows and arrows, lanterns, musical instruments, gold and silver, ornaments, dyed fabrics, paintings, medicine, needles, and artifacts, as well as many restaurants. The vendors (and in the Qing revision, the shops themselves) extend all along the great bridge, called the Rainbow Bridge (虹橋 ''Hong Qiao'') or, more rarely, the Shangtu Bridge (上土橋).

Where the great bridge crosses the river is the center and main focus of the scroll. A great commotion animates the people on the bridge. A boat approaches at an awkward angle with its [[mast (sailing)|mast]] not completely lowered, threatening to crash into the bridge. The crowds on the bridge and along the riverside are shouting and gesturing toward the boat. Someone near the apex of the bridge lowers a rope to the outstretched arms of the crew below. In addition to the shops and diners, there are inns, temples, private residences, and official buildings varying in grandeur and style, from huts to mansions with grand front- and backyards.

People and commodities are transported by various modes: wheeled wagons, [[Working animal|beasts of labor]] (in particular, a large number of donkeys and mules), sedan chairs, and chariots. The river is packed with fishing boats and passenger-carrying ferries, with men at the river bank, pulling the larger ships.

Many of these details are roughly corroborated by Song dynasty writings, principally the ''[[Dongjing Meng Hua Lu (Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital)|Dongjing Meng Hua Lu]]'', which describes many of the same features of life in the capital.

== Exhibition ==
In a rare move, the Song original was exhibited in Hong Kong from June 29 to mid-August 2007 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's transfer to the [[People's Republic of China]]. It is estimated that the costs of shipping the painting ran into tens of millions of dollars in addition to an undisclosed cost of insuring this piece of priceless art.

An early copy, generally considered to be very faithful to the original, was made by [[Zhao Mengfu]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]]. Another notable remake was painted during the [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries). This version has a length of 6.7 meters, longer than the original. It also replaced the scenery from the Song dynasty to that of the Ming dynasty based on contemporary fashions and customs, updating the costumes worn by the characters and the styles of vehicles (boats and carts). The Song wooden bridge is replaced with a stone bridge in the Ming remake. The arc of the stone bridge is much taller than that of the wooden original, and where the original had a boat about to crash into the bridge, the reinterpretation has a boat being methodically guided under the bridge by ropes, pulled by men ashore, several other large boats dutifully waiting their turn, undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sing Tao Daily]]'' Hong Kong Island edition. Issue 72, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;   A 12 meter long copy from the late Ming period is kept in the collection of the [[Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna]] in [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/querrolle-flussufer-szene-am-qingming-fest-kopie-nach-zhang-zeduan-1085%E2%80%931145/kQEqE6L5pXeUww&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version by five [[Qing dynasty]] court painters (Chen Mu, Sun Hu, Jin Kun, Dai Hong and Cheng Zhidao) was presented to the [[Qianlong Emperor]] on January 15, 1737. This version, shown below, was later moved, along with many other artifacts, to the [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei in 1949.&lt;ref name=Taipei&gt;{{cite web|author=The National Palace Museum, Taipei |url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/collection/selections_02.htm?docno=90&amp;catno=15&amp;pageno=5 |title=''Along the River During the Ch'ing-ming Festival'' (with zoom-in viewer) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028105008/http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/collection/selections_02.htm?docno=90&amp;catno=15&amp;pageno=5 |archivedate=October 28, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many more people, over 4,000, in the Qing remake, which also is much larger (at 11 metres by 35&amp;nbsp;cm, or 37&amp;nbsp;ft by 1&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="video" /&gt; The leftmost third of this version is within the palace, with buildings and people appearing refined and elegant. Most people within the castle are women, with some well-dressed officials. On the contrary, in the original Song version, the leftmost side is still the busy city.

=== Associated poem ===

In April 1742, a poem was added to the right-most end of the Qing remake. The poem apparently was composed by the [[Qianlong Emperor]]; the calligraphy is in the [[running script]] style, and is in the hand of Liang Shizheng (梁詩正), a prominent court official and frequent companion of the Qianlong Emperor. The poem reads as follows:

=== Digital version ===
For a three-month period in the [[World Expo 2010]] presented at the China Pavilion, the original painting was remade into a 3D animated, viewer-interactive digital version, titled ''River of Wisdom'', about 30 times the size of the original scroll. The computer animated mural, with moving characters and objects and portraying the scene in 4-minute day to night cycles, was one of the primary exhibitions in the Chinese Pavilion, drawing queues up to two hours with a reservation. Elaborate computer animation gives life to the painting.

After the Expo, the digital version was on display at the [[AsiaWorld–Expo]] in [[Hong Kong]] from November 9 to 29, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =20 October 2010 |url=http://www.cnngo.com/hong-kong/life/200000-tickets-sold-out-first-day-glimpse-along-river-during-qingming-festival-666493 |title=Queue for hours to get tickets to 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' or see it here |publisher=CNNGO |date=October 20, 2010 |accessdate=October 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414093512/http://www.cnngo.com/hong-kong/life/200000-tickets-sold-out-first-day-glimpse-along-river-during-qingming-festival-666493 |archivedate=April 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was a major commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2010/11/12/too-hot-a-ticket-river-of-wisdom/|title='River of Wisdom' is Hong Kong's hottest ticket|author =Seno, Alexandra A.|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|date=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then exhibited at the [[Macau East Asian Games Dome|Macau Dome]] in [[Macau]] from March 25 to April 14, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/22963-Animated-Chinese-painting-Macau.html|title=Animated Chinese painting in Macau|publisher=''Macau Daily Times''|date=3 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195546/http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/22963-Animated-Chinese-painting-Macau.html|archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital painting also traveled to [[Taiwan]] and displayed at the Expo Dome in [[Taipei]] from July 1 to September 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.taipei.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=2057299&amp;ctNode=8472&amp;mp=100002|title=Renowned Chinese Painting Animation Show Comes to Expo Dome|publisher=Taipei City Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From December 7, 2011 to February 6, 2012, in an exhibition titled ''A Moving Masterpiece: The Song Dynasty As Living Art'', the digital reproduction was exhibited at the [[Singapore Expo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sg.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/art-city-song-dynasty-living-art-021030368.html|title=Art and the City: The Song Dynasty as a Living Art|publisher=Yahoo!

==Analysis and questions==

Scholars have studied the painting more and more carefully in the second half of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first century but do not agree on many basic points.&lt;ref name="Doar " /&gt;
=== Translations of the title ===
Scholars have disputed the accuracy of the translation of the painting's name; the word ''Qingming'' may refer to either the [[Qingming Festival]] or to "peace and order". Several translations have been suggested, such as:
* ''Going Upriver on the Qingming Festival'' 
* ''Life along the Bian River at the Qingming Festival'' 
* ''Life Along the Bian River at the Pure Brightness Festival'' 
* ''Riverside Scene at Qingming Festival'' 
* ''Upper River during Qing Ming Festival''
* ''Spring Festival on the River'',&lt;ref name=Bahr&gt;{{cite journal |last= Priest |first= Alan |date=June 1948 |title= Spring Festival on the River |journal= The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series|volume= 6|issue= 10|pages=280–292|doi=10.2307/3258128|jstor= 3258128 |publisher= The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Spring Festival Along the River'', or alternatively,
* ''Peace Reigns Over the River''.

During the late 1960s, the Taipei Palace Museum released a series of books (later digitized as CD-ROM), videos, and stamps about the scroll that translated it loosely as ''A City of Cathay''.&lt;ref name=video&gt;
{{cite web|first=Government Information Office |last=The Republic of China |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/live/av/sou_sig/sight04_1.htm |title=Video (26 min.) of ''A City of Cathay'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124049/http://www.gio.gov.tw/live/av/sou_sig/sight04_1.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stamps&gt;{{cite web |author = Art on Stamps | publisher= Victor Manta, Switzerland| url=http://www.artonstamps.org/Countries/Taiwan/Cathay/cathay-city.htm |title= Old Chinese Paintings on Stamps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning and content===
Three things have been accepted about the original painting:
* The city depicted is [[Kaifeng]]
* It was painted before the fall of the [[Northern Song dynasty]] in 1127
* It depicts the Qingming Festival&lt;ref name="Doar " /&gt;

Some recent scholarship challenges each of those assertions:  
* The city depicted is an idealized non-existent city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hansen |first= Valerie |coauthors= |year= 1996 |month= |title= Mystery of the Qingming Scroll and Its Subject: The Case Against Kaifeng|journal= [[Journal of Song-Yuan Studies]] |url= http://history.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/hansen-qingming-scroll(2).pdf|volume= |issue=26 |pages=183–200|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was painted after the fall of the Northern Song dynasty in 1127
* It depicts a scene in early autumn

In 2003 a further interpretation was presented:&lt;ref&gt;Tsao Hsingyuan, "Unraveling the Mystery of the Handscroll 'Qingming Shanghe Tu'", in ''[[Journal of Song-Yuan Studies]]'' 33 (2003): 155–179.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The city depicted is indeed Kaifeng
* It depicts a day in the Qingming [[solar term]] of the [[Chinese calendar]], but not the Qingming Festival itself

An interpretation published in 2013 proposed that the painting was the artist's subtle entreaty to the emperor to discern dangerous trends beneath the surface of prosperity, and some of the suggested hints were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= 马 |first= 伯庸 |coauthors= |year= 2013 |month= |title= 古董局中局2：清明上河图之谜 |volume= |issue= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Receiving grain shipment at the docks was crucial to Kaifeng which depended on transporting the food from the far south, yet only a lowly official was on duty
* The few guards stationed at the city gate and the docks appeared not to be alert and even lax in their appearances
* The term "Qingming" did not refer to the solar term but was taken from the phrase 清明之世 ("A bright and enlightened era") from the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'', and the name of the painting was meant to be ironic

The wooden bridge depicted in the original version was reconstructed by a team of engineers and documented by the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television show ''[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'' during their ''[[Secrets of Lost Empires]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author =''[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'' |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/lostempires/china/builds.html |title= Building a Rainbow Bridge}} {{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/27fbchina.html |title= Transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An Amateur Concert''''' is an oil painting on canvas by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] painter [[Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro]] of 1882.

== Description ==
The painting measures 220 cm and 300 cm wide. It is in the collection of the [[Chiado Museum]] in [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref name="matriz"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.matriznet.dgpc.pt/MatrizNet/Objectos/ObjectosConsultar.aspx?IdReg=200758|title=MatrizNet|website=www.matriznet.dgpc.pt|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five people are singing and playing in the dark: Maria Augusta Bordalo Pinheiro, the artist's sister, in a white satin dress; next to her, the painter [[Adolfo Greno]] in right profile; then an Italian singer in a dark suit; in the background Josefa Greno, in a three-quarters view, looking down; and on the far right another painter, [[Artur Loureiro]], at the piano.&lt;ref name="matriz" /&gt;

== Analysis ==
The large painting was presented at the 1882 [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] under the title ''Soirée chez lui''. The oval composition shows the social circle. It is friendship that unites them both in painting and music, though a shadowy unknown figure next to the piano is watching. In France it was not received well, and in Portugal there was controversy about the abstract and vague figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063606/POR_280_005.html|title=Concerto de Amadores|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30966">'''Arts and entertainment in India'''  have had their course shaped by a synthesis of indigenous and foreign influences that have consequently shaped the course of the arts of the rest of Asia,  since ancient times.  Arts refer to [[Indian art|paintings]], [[Indian architecture|architecture]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Music of India|music]], [[Indian classical dance|dance]], [[languages of India|languages]] and [[Cinema of India|cinema]]. In early India, most of the arts were derived [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] influences. After the birth of contemporary [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sikhism]] arts flourished under the patronage of kings and emperors. The coming of [[Islam]] spawned a whole new era of Indian architecture and art. Finally the British brought their own Gothic and Roman influences and fused it with the Indian style. They have a culture infusion in their art.

==Architecture==
{{Main|Architecture of India}}
{{Peacock|date=October 2009}}
[[File:Taj Mahal, Agra, India.jpg|thumb|The [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]] is widely considered to be the best example of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] and is one of the most well-known monuments in the world.]]
Indian architecture consists of production of the [[Indian subcontinent]] which encompasses a multitude of expressions over space and time, transformed by the forces of history considered unique to the sub-continent, sometimes destroying, but most of the time absorbing. The result is an evolving range of architectural production that nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history.

The earliest production in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] was characterised by well planned cities and houses where religion did not seem to play an active role. The Buddhist period is primarily represented by three important building types- the Chaitya Hall (place of worship), the [[Vihara]] (monastery) and the [[Stupa]] (hemispherical mound for worship/ memory) - exemplified by the extraordinary caves of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] and the monumental [[Sanchi]] [[Stupa]]. The [[Jainism|Jaina]] temples are characterised by a richness of detail that can be seen in the [[Dilwara Temples]] in [[Mt.Abu]]. Early beginnings of Hindu temple architecture have been traced to the remains at [[Aihole]] and [[Pattadakal]] in present-day [[Karnataka]], and have [[Vedic altars]] and late Vedic temples as described by [[Pāṇini]] as models. Later, as more differentiation took place, the Dravidian/ Southern style and or the Indo-Aryan/ Northern/ Nagara style of temple architecture emerged as dominant modes, epitomized in productions such as the magnificent [[Brihadeeswara Temple]], [[Thanjavur]], and the [[Sun Temple]], [[Konark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/240|title=Khajuraho Group of Monuments|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/246|title=Sun Temple, Konârak|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the arrival of [[Islam]], a new style of architecture known as [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] emerged combining traditional Indian and Islamic elements. The earliest examples include the [[Qutb Minar complex|Qutb complex]], a series of monuments built by successive sultans of the [[Delhi Sultanate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/233|title=Qutb Minar and its Monuments, Delhi|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mughal architecture|architecture]] of the [[Mughal Empire]] includes the [[Red Fort]], [[Taj Mahal]], [[Agra Fort]], [[Humayun's Tomb|Humayun's tomb]], [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] and [[Fatehpur Sikri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/232|title=Humayun's Tomb, Delhi|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/252|title=Taj Mahal|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With colonization, a new chapter began. Though the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and the French made substantial forays, it was the English who had a lasting impact. The architecture of the colonial period varied from the beginning attempts at creating authority through classical prototypes to the later approach of producing a supposedly more responsive image through what is now termed [[Indo-Saracenic]] architecture- a mixture of Hindu, Islamic and Western elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/945|title=Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus)|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the introduction of [[Modern Architecture]] into India and later with Independence, the quest was more towards progress as a paradigm fuelled by [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]]vian visions. The planning of [[Chandigarh]]- a city most architects hate/love- by [[Le Corbusier]] was considered a step towards this. Later as modernism exhausted itself in the West and new directions were sought for, in India too there was a search for a more meaningful architecture rooted in the Indian context. This direction called [[Critical Regionalism]] is exemplified in the works of architects such as [[B. V. Doshi]], [[Charles Correa]], etc. Apart from this, the advent of globalisation and economic development since the 90s, has spawned an impressive collection of modern IT campuses and skyscrapers, and as economic reform accelerates, metropolitan areas are gaining futuristic skylines.

==Literature==
{{Main|Indian literature}}
[[Image:Rabindranath Tagore in 1909.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Rabindranath Tagore]] won the [[Nobel prize]] for literature. It is the first Nobel prize won by Asia.]]
Indian literature is generally acknowledged, but not wholly established, as the oldest in the world. India has 22 officially recognized [[Languages of India|languages]], and a huge variety of literature has been produced in these languages over the years. In Indian literature, [[Oral literature|oral]] and written forms are both important. [[Hindu]] literary traditions dominate a large part of Indian culture. Apart from the [[Vedas]] which are a sacred form of knowledge, there are other works such as the Hindu epics ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', treatises such as [[Vaastu Shastra]] in architecture and town planning, and [[Arthashastra]] in political science. Devotional Hindu drama, poetry and songs span the subcontinent. Among the best known are the works of [[Kalidasa]] (writer of the famed Sanskrit play [[Shakuntala]]) and [[Tulsidas]] (who wrote an epic Hindi poem based on the Ramayana, called [[Raamcharitmaanas]]).

[[Tamil language|Tamil]] literature has been in existence for more than 2500 years. [[Tolkaappiyam]] has been credited as its oldest work, whereas the exact origins of [[Thirukkural]] is unknown. The golden age of Tamil literature was during the [[Sangam period]], roughly 1800 years ago. The classic works of this period are [[Cilappatikaram]], [[Manimekalai]], and Sivakasinthamani. Tamil literature is known for its secular traditions, although its authors had strong religious beliefs. [[Thirukkural]] is considered to be the greatest of Tamil works. [[Kannada]] literature is probably the third oldest in Indian literature next to [[Sanskrit literature]] and [[Tamil literature]]. The earliest reported work in Kannada literature dates back to the fifth century. The first available literary in Kannada is [[Kavirajamarga]], written in the eighth century by Amoghavarsha Nrpatunga. [[Hindi literature]] started as religious and philosophical poetry in medieval periods in dialects like [[Avadhi]] and [[Brij]]. The most famous figures from this period are [[Kabir]] and [[Tulsidas]]. In modern times, the ''Khadi'' dialect became more prominent and a variety of literature was produced in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]].

The most renowned Bengali writer is Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]], who received the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. In the last century, several Indian writers have distinguished themselves not only in traditional [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] but also in English. India's only native-born Nobel laureate in literature was the [[Bengal]]i writer [[Rabindranath Tagore]], but VS Naipaul, a diaspora Indian novelist born in Trinidad, also won the Nobel in 2001. Other major writers who are either Indian or of Indian origin and derive much inspiration from Indian themes are [[R. K. Narayan]], [[Vikram Seth]], [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Arundhati Roy]], [[Raja Rao]], [[Amitav Ghosh]], [[Vikram Chandra (novelist)|Vikram Chandra]], [[Mukul Kesavan]], [[Shashi Tharoor]], [[Nayantara Sehgal]], [[Anita Desai]], [[Ashok Banker]], [[Shashi Deshpande]], [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], and [[Bharati Mukherjee]].

==Music==
{{Main|Music of India}}
Indian music includes multiple varieties of [[folk music|folk]], [[popular music|popular]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[Indian classical music|classical music]]. India's classical music tradition, including [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] and [[Hindustani music]], has a history spanning millennia and, developed over several eras, remains fundamental to the lives of Indians today as sources of religious inspiration, cultural expression and pure entertainment. India is made up of several dozen [[ethnic group]]s, speaking their own [[language]]s and [[dialect]]s. Alongside distinctly [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinental]] forms there are major influences from [[Persian traditional music|Persian]], [[Arab music|Arab]] and [[Music of the United Kingdom|British music]]. Indian genres like [[filmi]] and [[Bhangra (music)|bhangra]] have become popular throughout the United Kingdom, [[South Asia|South]] and [[East Asia]], and around the world.

Indian stars now sell records in many countries, while [[world music]] fans listen to the roots music of India's diverse nations. American [[soul music|soul]], [[rock and roll|rock]] and [[hip hop music]] have also made a large impact, primarily on Indian pop and filmi music. Other highly popular forms are [[ghazal]], [[qawwali]], [[thumri]], [[dhrupad]], [[dadra]], [[bhajan]], [[kirtan]], [[Shabda|shabad]], and [[gurbani]].
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:ravi-shankar.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Pandit [[Ravi Shankar (musician)|Ravi Shankar]] and his daughter performing with [[sitar]]s a Hindustani Concert]] --&gt;
[[Filmi]] music is often said to have begun in 1931, with the release of Ardeshir M. Irani's [[Alam Ara]] and its popular soundtrack. In the earliest years of the Indian cinema, filming was generally Indian (classical and folk) in inspiration, with some Western elements. Over the years, the Western elements have increased, but without completely destroying the Indian flavour.  Most of the Indian movies are musicals and feature elaborate song and dance numbers.  There is constant work for pop music composers — or music directors, to use the Indian term.  Movie soundtracks are released as tapes and CDs, sometimes even before the movie is released.

==Dance==
{{Main|Indian classical dance|Indian folk dances}}
Indian classical dance is performed in different styles. Its theory can be traced back to the [[Natya Shastra]] of [[Bharata Muni]], a sage from Tamil Nadu (400 BC). The Natya Shastra is the most important ancient treatise on [[classical Indian dance]]. It is also called the fifth [[Veda]] in reference to the foundation of Hindu religion and philosophy, from which sprang the related South Indian musical tradition of [[Carnatic music]]. Its various current forms include [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Odissi]], [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Mohiniaattam]], [[Kathak]] and [[Sattriya dance|Sattriya]].

'''Bharatanatyam''' is a classical [[dance]] form originating in [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is thought to have been created by Bharata Muni. In ancient times Bharatanatyam was performed by [[mandir]] (Hindu temple) [[Devadasi]]s. Many of the ancient sculptures in Hindu temples are based on Bharatanatyam dance postures [[karana dance|karana]]s.

'''Odissi''' is one of the oldest surviving forms of dance, with depictions of Odissi dancing dating back as far as the 1st century BC. Like other forms of Indian classical dance, the Odissi style traces its origins back to antiquity. Dancers are found depicted in bas-relief in the hills of Udaygiri (near [[Bhubaneswar]]) dating back to the 1st century BC. The [[Natya Shastra]] speaks of the dance from this region and refers to it as Odra-Magadhi.

'''Kathakali''' (''katha'' for [[Narrative|story]], ''kali'' for [[performance]] or [[Play (theatre)|play]]) is a form of dance-[[drama]]. It originated in the [[South India]]n state of [[Kerala]] over 500 years ago. It is a spectacular combination of drama, dance, music and ritual. Characters with vividly painted faces and elaborate costumes re-enact stories from the [[Hindu]] epics, [[Mahabharata]] and [[Ramayana]].

'''Kuchipudi''' is a classical dance form from [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Telangana]], a state of [[South India]]. Kuchipudi is the name of a small village in the Divi Taluq of [[Krishna district]] that borders the [[Bay of Bengal]] and with resident [[Brahmin]]s practising this traditional dance form, it acquired the present name.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:bhangra.jpg|thumb|right|300px|World famous bhangra dance.]] --&gt;
'''Mohiniaattam''' is a traditional dance from the South Indian state of Kerala. [[Mohini]] is an [[Apsaras]] in the Hindu mythology and aattam in [[Malayalam]] means dance. So Mohiniaattam essentially means "dance of the enchantress". The theme of Mohiniaattam is love and devotion to god. The costume worn by the dancers are typically white coloured kasavu [[saree]] with golden borders.

The '''Kathak''' dance form arose from the [[Vaishnava]] devotees dancing to the episodes from [[Krishna]]'s life. Originally a Northern Indian temple dance, it was transformed to a court dance in the [[Mughal era]]. The new Muslim influence brought with it certain changes to the dance form: what had been a largely devotional practice now became more a courtly entertainment.

The '''Sattriya''' dance is believed to be a creation of the great [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] ([[bhakti]]) guru [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] considered the lead architect of Assamese [[literature]] and [[culture]]. He created this magnificent Sattriya dance to accompany the ''Ankiya Naat'' (a form of Assamese one-act play, another creation of Sankardeva) which was usually performed in ''Satras'' (Assamese monasteries). Since the dance developed and grew within the ''Satras'', it is named after these religious institutions.

'''Folk dances''' are performed for every possible occasion, to celebrate the arrival of seasons, birth of a child, a wedding and festivals. The dances are very focused on gestures, postures, and expressions. The dances burst with verve and vitality. Men and women perform some dances exclusively, while in some performances men and women dance together. On most occasions artists sing the main lyrics and are accompanied by instruments. Each form of dance has a specific costume. Most costumes are flamboyant with extensive jewels.

'''Bhangra''' is a form of music and dance that originated in the [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] region of [[India]]. [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]] dance began as a folk dance conducted by [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] farmers to celebrate the coming of [[Vaisakhi]], a [[sikh]] festival. The specific moves reflect the manner in which villagers farmed their land. This musical art further became synthesized after the partition of India, when refugees from different parts of the Punjab shared their folk dances with individuals who resided in the regions they settled in. This hybrid dance became Bhangra. The dance started from just one move and evolved later on. It has been popularized by Punjabi artists from the [[Sikh]] communities, with which it is now commonly associated.[1] Today, [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]] dance survives in different forms and styles all over the globe – including pop music, film soundtracks, collegiate competitions and even talent shows.

'''Thirayattam''' is a ritual performing  dance  of south malabar region (kozhikode and malappuram Dt:) in [[Kerala]] state.In [[Malayalam]] language, the word "Thirayattam" refers to a 'colourful dance'  This vibrant Ethnic art form blend of dance,instrumental music, drama, facial and body makeup, martial art and ritualistic  Function. [[Thirayattam]] enacted in courtyards of sacred groves and village shrines, during Thirayattam festival.&lt;ref&gt; "Thirayattam" ( Folklore Text- malayalam, Moorkkanad peethambaran),State Institute of language, Kerala. {{ISBN|978-81-200-4294-0}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Sculpture ==
{{main|Sculpture in India}}
 first sculptures in India date back to the [[Indus Valley civilization]], where stone and bronze carvings have been discovered. This is one of the earliest instances of sculpture in the world. Later, as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] developed further, India produced some of the most intricate bronzes in the world, as well as unriveled temple carvings. Some huge shrines, such as the one at [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] were not actually constructed using blocks, but instead carved out of solid rock, making them perhaps the largest and most intricate sculptures in the world.

During the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far northern India, in what is now southern [[Afghanistan]] and northern Pakistan, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha's life and teachings. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because [[Gandhara]]n Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Persia]]n artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc.

The pink sandstone sculptures of Mathura evolved during the Gupta period (4th to 6th century) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. Newer sculptures in [[Afghanistan]], in stucco, schist or clay, display very strong blending of Indian post-Gupta mannerism and Classical influence, Hellenistic or possibly even Greco-Roman. Meanwhile, elsewhere in India, less anatomically accurate styles of human representation evolved, leading to the classical art that the world is now familiar with, and contributing to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Asia.

== Painting ==
{{Main|Indian painting}}
The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[pre-historic]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]], [[Maharashtra]] [[States and territories of India|state]] present an example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals. Thereafter, frescoes of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and Ellora caves appeared. India's [[Buddhist]] literature is replete with examples of texts which describe that palaces of kings and aristocratic class were embellished with paintings, but they have not survived. But, it is believed that some form of art painting was practiced in that time.

Indian Art was given a new lease of life by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in early 19th century when the new [[government]] required painters to document Indian life and times. The English School paintings, as these new art were called had seen the emergence of India's greatest artists of all times [[Raja Ravi Verma]]. Other important artists of the Colonial period include [[Jamini Roy]], Amrita Shergil, Ramkinker Baij and [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. After independence, Indian art became more diverse and artists like [[Maqbool Fida Hussain]], Francis Newton Souza, [[Subodh Gupta]], [[Devajyoti Ray]], Sudip Roy,&lt;ref name=dna12&gt;{{cite news |title=Florence Biennale: Sudip Roy wins award for Christ, Gandhi, Teresa-Trilogy |url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/plumage/florence-biennale-sudip-roy-s-wins-award-for-for-christ-gandhi-teresa-trilogy |publisher=[[The Times of India]] |date=Dec 27, 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paresh Maity]] and Bose Krishnamachari earned international recognition.

==Cinema==
{{Peacock|date=October 2009}}
{{Main|Cinema of India}}
India is a major regional center for [[film|cinema]]. The Indian film industry is the second largest in the world (1200 movies released in the year 2002). Each of the larger jrods supports its own film industry: [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]. The Hindi/Urdu film industry, based in [[Mumbai]], formerly ''Bombay'', is called [[Bollywood]] (a melding of [[Hollywood]] and Bombay). Similar neologisms have been coined for the Kannada (Karnataka State) film industry ([[Sandalwood]]) based on Karnataka being known for Sandalwood, Tamil film industry ([[Kollywood]], from the Kodambakkam district of [[Chennai]]) and the Telugu film industry ([[Cinema of Andhra Pradesh|Tollywood]]). Tollygunge is a [[metonym]] for the Bengali film industry, long centered in the Tollygunge district of [[Kolkata]]. The Bengali language industry is notable as having nurtured the director [[Satyajit Ray]], an internationally renowned filmmaker and a winner of many awards, among them the yo yorat Ratna (India's highest civilian award), the [[Légion d'honneur]] (France), and the Lifetime achievement [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. The Bollywood industry is usually the largest in terms of films produced and box office receipts, just as Urdu/Hindi speakers outnumber speakers of other Indian languages within India. (Tollywood is close on Bollywood's heels, and sometimes will turn out more films in a year.)

== Radio ==
Radio broadcasting was, until recently a government monopoly under the Directorate General of [[All India Radio]]—established in 1936 and since 1957 also known as Akashvani—a government-owned, semicommercial operation of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. From only six stations at the time of independence, All India Radio's network had expanded by the mid-1990s to 146 AM stations plus a National Channel, the Integrated North-East Service (aimed at tribal groups in northeast India), and the External Service. There are five regional headquarters for All India Radio: the North Zone in New Delhi; the North-East Zone in Guwahati, Assam; the East Zone in Calcutta; the West Zone in Bombay; and the South Zone in Madras. All India Radio covers 99.37% of India's populace.

The government-owned network provides both national and local programs in Hindi, English, and sixteen regional languages. Commercial services, which were inaugurated in 1957, are provided by [[Vividh Bharati]] Service, headquartered in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/go-gaga-with-vividh-bharatis-golden-year/49854-8.html|title=Go gaga with Vividh Bharati's golden year|date=Oct 3, 2007|publisher=CNN-IBN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vividh Bharati]], which accepts advertisements, broadcasts from thirty-one AM and FM stations in the mid-1990s.

India has an extensive network of medium wave and shortwave stations. In 1994 there were eighty-five FM stations and seventy-three shortwave stations that covered the entire country. The broadcasting equipment is mostly Indian made and reaches special audiences, such as farmers needing agroclimatic, plant protection, and other agriculture-related information. The number of radio receivers increased almost fivefold between 1970 and 1994, from around 14 million to nearly 65 million. Most radios are also produced within India.

The foreign broadcast service is a function of the External Services Division of All India Radio. In 1994 seventy hours of news, features, and entertainment programs were broadcast daily in twenty-five languages using thirty-two shortwave transmitters. The principal target audiences are listeners in neighbouring countries and the large overseas Indian community.

Satellite Radio was introduced to the Indian market in 2000 by [[WorldSpace]], a Washington-DC based company. Currently WorldSpace beams 30 channels comprising music, news, and regional channels, a subscriber in India pays {{Indian Rupee}} 1,200 per annum. In addition, some premium channels are available at an extra cost. This service requires special receivers which are often subsidized by world space.

Recently The Department of Space (DoS) indicated it is exploring the possibility of setting up a multi-media satellite platform that would include satellite radio, video and data channels.

== Television ==
{{Main|Television in India}}
Television service is available throughout the country. [[Doordarshan]] is a government-owned broadcaster established in 1959 and a part of All India Radio until 1976. It operates of one national network and seven regional networks. In 1992 there were sixty-three high-power television transmitters, 369 medium-power transmitters, seventy-six low-power transmitters, and twenty-three transposers. Regular satellite transmissions began in 1982 (the same year colour transmission began).
By 1994 some 6 million people were receiving television broadcasts via satellite, and the number was expected to increase rapidly throughout the rest of the decade. Cable television was even more prolific, with an estimated 12 to 15 million subscribers in 1994. Besides Doordarshan, [[Zee TV]]—an independent station broadcasting from Mumbai since 1992—uses satellite transmissions. In fact, because Doordarshan is the only network that is permitted to broadcast television signals domestically, [[Zee TV]] and other entrepreneurs broadcast their Indian-made videotapes via foreign transmitters. Other networks joining the fray are [[Cable News Network]] (1990); Asia Television Network (1991); Hong Kong-based [[STAR TV (Asia)|Star TV]] (1991); Jain TV, near Bombay (1994); EL TV, a spin-off of Zee TV in Bombay (1994); HTV, an affiliate of the [[Hindustan Times]] in New Delhi (1994); and [[Sun TV (India)|Sun TV]], a [[Tamil language]] service in Chennai (1994). In a communications breakthrough in July 1995, Doordarshan agreed, for a US$1.5 million annual fee and 50 percent of advertising revenue when it exceeds US$1.5 million, to allow CNN to broadcast twenty-four hours a day via an Indian satellite. regional, and local service. The number of television sets increased from around 500,000 in 1976 to 9 million in early 1987 and to around 47 million in 1994; increases are expected to continue at around 6 million sets per year. More than 75 percent of television sets were black and white models in 1992, but the proportion of colour sets is increasing annually. Most television sets are produced in India.

'''Azerbaijan State Theatre of Musical Comedy''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Dövlət Musiqili Komediya Teatrı}}) – is one of the leading musical theatres of [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==History==
The premiere of ''Husband and wife'', a musical comedy written by [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]] in 1909, was held on May 24, 1910 in the building of the Nikitin brothers’ circus, in [[Baku]]. This production laid the foundation of Azerbaijan State Theatre of Musical Comedy. By 1938, musical comedies were displayed on the stage of [[Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater]]. In 1938, an independent theatre of musical comedy (with [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] departments), which acquired official status of "Azerbaijan State Theatre of Musical Comedy" in September of the same year, was organized. In 1939, the first Azerbaijani and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] musical comedies such as ''Bride for 5 manats'' ([[Said Rustamov|S.Rustamov]]), ''Husband and wife'',''The married bachelor'', (later ''Whose wedding?'') (A.Mashadibeyov) and ''Roza'' (S.Hajibeyov) were staged. Comedies such as ''[[The Blue Mazurka|Blue mazurka]]'' ([[Franz Lehár]]), ''Arshin mal alan'' (U.Hajibeyov), ''[[Die Zirkusprinzessin|The Circus Princess]] '' ([[Emmerich Kálmán|Imre Kálmán]]), ''Wedding in Malinovka'' (B.Aleksandrov) and others were staged by the Russian department of the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

From the 1940s onwards, the theatre took a significant place in cultural life of Azerbaijan.

The absence of a building for the theatre in the period 1988-1992, coupled with socio-political events  in the new Republic, affected the creative activity of the theatre’s collective. However the theatre then entered into a new stage of its development,  in a new building. Amongst the pieces presented were: ''[[If Not That One, Then This One]], Konul, Love on the stage, Goodbye!, Everyone has his own star'',  and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

      <comment>/* China */ Hyphenated the adjectival phrases ‘high-tin’ and ‘low-tin’—a good idea in general, and crucial here, as ‘high’ and ‘low’ could also refer to the physical shape of the sword’s parts rather than their metallurgical composition. Also improved the last sentence, which was a bit awkward.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15627">[[File:Apa Schwerter.jpg|thumb|300px|Apa type swords, 17th century BC.]]
'''Bronze Age swords''' appeared from around the 17th century BC, in the [[Black Sea]] region and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], as a further development of the [[dagger]]. They were replaced by [[Iron Age sword|iron swords]] during the early part of the 1st millennium BC.

From an early time the swords reached lengths in excess of 100&amp;nbsp;cm. The technology to produce blades of such lengths appears to have been developed in the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]], using  alloys of copper and tin or arsenic, around 1700 BC. [[Bronze Age]] swords were typically not longer than 80&amp;nbsp;cm; weapons significantly shorter than 60&amp;nbsp;cm are variously categorized as ''[[short swords]]'' or daggers. Before about 1400 BC swords remained mostly limited to the Aegean and southeastern Europe, but they became more widespread in the final centuries of the 2nd millennium BC, to Central Europe and Britain, to the Near East, Central Asia, Northern India and to China.

==Predecessors==
[[File:Khopesh.jpg|thumb|right|250px|18th century BC [[Khopesh]], [[Shechem]], [[West Bank]]; blade decorations with [[electrum]] inlays.]]
Before [[bronze]], stone (such as [[flint]] and [[obsidian]]) was used as the primary material for edged cutting tools and weapons. Stone, however, is too brittle for long, thin implements such as swords. With the introduction of [[copper]], and subsequently bronze, knives could be made longer, leading to the sword.

Thus, the development of the sword from the [[dagger]] was gradual, and in 2004 the first "swords" were claimed for the Early Bronze Age (c. 33rd to 31st centuries), based on finds at [[Arslantepe]] by Marcella Frangipane, professor of Prehistory and Protohistory of the Near and Middle East at [[Sapienza University of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dekunukem.deviantart.com/journal/Oldest-Swords-Found-in-Turkey-369725919 Oldest Swords Found in Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frangipane, M. et.al. 2010: The collapse of the 4th millennium centralised system at Arslantepe and the far-reaching changes in 3rd millennium societies. ORIGINI XXXIV, 2012: 237-260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frangipane, "The 2002 Exploration Campaign at Arslantepe/Malatya" (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; A cache of nine swords and daggers was found; they are made of [[Arsenical bronze|arsenic-copper alloy]]. Among them, three swords were beautifully inlaid with [[silver]].

These are the weapons of a total length of 45 to 60&amp;nbsp;cm which could be described as either short swords or long daggers. Some other similar swords have been found in Turkey, and are described by Thomas Zimmermann.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/iss/kap_b/backbone/rb_1_1.html First Swords] uni-kiel.de&lt;/ref&gt;

The sword remained extremely rare for another millennium, and became more widespread only with the closing of the 3rd millennium. The "swords" of this later period can still readily be interpreted as daggers, as with the copper specimen from Naxos (dated roughly 2800 to 2300 BC), with a length of just below 36&amp;nbsp;cm, but individual specimens of the [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic]] "copper swords" of the period around 2300 reach a length up to 60&amp;nbsp;cm.  The first weapons that can unambiguously be classified as swords are those found in [[Minoan Crete]], dated to about 1700 BC, which reach lengths of more than 100&amp;nbsp;cm. These are the "type A" swords of the Aegean Bronze Age.

{{Further|Military of Mycenaean Greece#Offensive weapons}}

The [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] (Middle to Late Aegean Bronze Age) swords are classified in types labeled A to H following [[Nancy Sandars|Sandars]] (1961, 1963), the "Sandars typology".&lt;!-- ?Killian-Dirlmeier typology--&gt;
Types A and B (''Tab-tang'') are the earliest from about the 17th to 16th centuries, types C (''Horned swords'') and D (''Cross swords'') from the 15th century, types E and F (''T-hilt swords'') from the 13th and 12th.
The 13th to 12th centuries also see a revival of the "Horned" type, classified as types G and H.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Swords and daggers in Late Bronze Age Canaan |last=Shalev |first=Sariel |page=62 |year=2004 |publisher=[[Franz Steiner Verlag]] |isbn=978-3-515-08198-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Type H swords are associated with the [[Sea Peoples]] and were found in  Anatolia ([[Pergamon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Omero tremila anni dopo: atti del Congresso di Genova, 6-8 luglio 2000 |chapter=Anatolia and the Eastern Aegean at the time of the Trojan War |last=Benzi |first=Marion |editor=Franco Montanari, Paola Ascheri |page=384 |year=2002 |publisher=Edizione di Storia e Letteratura |isbn=978-88-8498-059-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Greece.
Contemporary with types E to H is the so-called Naue II type, imported from south-eastern Europe.

Typologically, these swords are of the ''Sögel'' type, but their shape and decoration&lt;ref&gt;
"the decorative lines on the sword blades that had initially been regarded as incrustations consisted of pure copper hammered into channels that had presumably already been produced in the casting process. Thus the swords are among the very few Early Bronze Age examples of a true inlay technique outside the Mediterranean world [...] An interesting parallel to these has now been found in a sword from the parish of Vreta Kloster in Östergötland, Sweden."

"Typologically, the swords from Nebra and Vreta belong to the Sögel blades, which copy the shape and decoration of Hajdúsámson-Apa swords [...] Concerning the provenance of the swords, the area between the rivers Danube and Tisza in present-day Hungary and Romania has been suggested, as also the production in present Germany [...] Vandkilde (1996:240) proposed that these swords and daggers of the Sögel and Wohlde type in southern Jutland could have been manufactured locally."

{{Further|Bronze Age Europe}}

===Naue II===
One of the most important, and longest-lasting, types of prehistoric European swords was the '''Naue II''' type, named for [[Julius Naue]] who first described them and also known as ''Griffzungenschwert'' or "grip-tongue sword". It first appears in c. the 13th century BC in [[Terramare culture|Northern Italy]] (or a general [[Urnfield culture|Urnfield]] background), and survived well into the Iron Age, with a life-span of about seven centuries, until the 6th century BC. During its lifetime the basic design was maintained, although the material changed from bronze to iron. Naue II swords were exported from Europe to the Aegean, and as far afield as [[Ugarit]], beginning about 1200 BC, i.e. just a few decades before the final collapse of the palace cultures in the [[Bronze Age collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Jung,  M. Mehofer, ''A sword of Naue II type from Ugarit and the Historical Significance of Italian type Weaponry in the Eastern Mediterranean'', Aegean Archaeology 8, 2008, 111–136.&lt;/ref&gt; Naue II swords could be as long as 85&amp;nbsp;cm, but most specimens fall into the 60 to 70&amp;nbsp;cm range.

Swords from the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] appear from ca. the 13th century BC, often showing characteristic spiral patterns. The early Nordic swords are also comparatively short; a specimen discovered in 1912 near Bragby, Uppland, Sweden, dated to about 1800 to 1500 BC, was just over 60&amp;nbsp;cm long. This sword was, however, classified as of the  Hajdúsámson-Apa type, and was presumably imported. The [[Vreta Kloster]] sword discovered in 1897 (dated 1600 to 1500 BC) has a blade length (the hilt is missing) of 46&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of National Antiquities (Statens Historiska Museum)   inventory number SHM 10419.&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical variant for European swords is the '''leaf shaped''' blade, which was most common in North-West Europe at the end of the Bronze Age, on the [[Bronze Age Britain|British Isles]] in particular.
The '''carp's tongue sword''' is a type of bronze sword that was common to Western Europe during ca. the 9th to 8th centuries BC. The blade of the carp's tongue sword was wide and parallel for most of its length but the final third narrowed into a thin tip intended for thrusting. The design was probably developed in north-western France, and combined the broad blade useful for slashing with a thinner, elongated tip suitable for thrusting. Its advantages saw its adoption across [[Atlantic Europe]]. In Britain, the metalwork in the south east derived its name from this sword: the [[Carp's Tongue complex]]. Notable examples of this type were part of the [[Isleham Hoard]].

The Bronze Age style sword and construction methods died out at the end of the early Iron Age (Hallstatt D)), around 600-500 BC, when swords are once again replaced by daggers in most of Europe. An exception is the [[Xiphos]] from Greece, the development of which continued for several more centuries.
The '''antenna sword''', named for the pair of ornaments suggesting antennae on its hilt,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antennae%20sword&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of the Late Bronze Age, continued in early [[iron swords]] of the [[East Hallstatt]] and Italy region.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis William, The archaeology of Celtic art, 2007,  p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
{{Further|Bronze Age China}}

Sword production in China is attested from the Bronze Age [[Shang Dynasty]], from roughly 1200 BC. The technology for bronze swords reached its high point during the [[Warring States period]] and [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 BC – 207 BC). Amongst the Warring States period swords, some unique technologies were used, such as casting high-tin edges over softer, lower-tin cores, or the application of diamond shaped patterns on the blade (see the [[sword of Gou Jian]]). Also unique for Chinese bronzes is the consistent use of high-tin bronze (17-21% tin), which is very hard and breaks under excess stress, whereas other cultures preferred lower tin bronze (usually 10%), which bends instead. China continued to make both iron and bronze swords longer than any other region; iron completely replaced bronze only in the early [[Han Dynasty]].

==India==
{{Further|Ochre Coloured Pottery culture}}
Swords have been recovered in archaeological findings of the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]] throughout the [[Ganges]]-[[Yamuna]] [[Doab]] region of India, commonly made of copper, but in some instances made of bronze.  Diverse specimens have been discovered in [[Fatehgarh]], where there are several varieties of hilt. These swords have been variously dated to periods between 1700-1400 BC, but were probably used more extensively during  1200-600 BC ([[Painted Grey Ware culture]], [[Iron Age India]]).&lt;ref&gt;F.R.

==History==

Castellani House was designed and built in by [[Cesar Castellani]], who was one of the most prominent and prolific architects of the colonial era in [[British Guiana]].  It was originally designed as a residence for the government [[botanist]], [[George Samuel Jenman]].  Dissatisfied with the original design of the house, Jenman refused to move into the residence until the changes he demanded had been implemented.  These changes were completed in 1882, and Jenman moved into the house in that year. After Jenman died, Castellani House was used as the official residence for Directors of Agriculture.&lt;ref name=Kandasammy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Baksh /&gt;

In 1942, the house was extended with the addition of a third storey to the original two.  In 1965, further changes were made to the structure of the house by the Guyanese architect, Hugh McGregor Reid.&lt;ref name=Kandasammy /&gt;

From 1965 to 1985, Castellani House was the Official Residence for Prime Minister [[Forbes Burnham]] and First Lady, Viola Burnham.  During this time it was known simply as "the Residence".&lt;ref name=Kandasammy /&gt;&lt;ref name=NTG&gt;{{cite web|last=National Trust of Guyana|title=Historic Bourda|url=http://www.nationaltrust.gov.gy/new/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=163|work=National Trust of Guyana Official Website|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a major refurbishment, Castellani House was re-opened as the home of the National Art Gallery in 1993.&lt;ref name=Kandasammy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Creighton /&gt;&lt;ref name=NTG /&gt;  The Gallery's first curator was Everley Austin (1994-1996).  Austin was followed by Elfrieda Bissember (1996-present).&lt;ref name=Creighton /&gt;

==Art collection==

Castellani House holds over 700 works of art.  The collection includes work by [[Frank Bowling]], [[Edward Rupert Burrowes|E. R. Burrowes]], [[Stanley Greaves]], [[Bernadette Persaud]], [[George Simon (artist and archaeologist)|George Simon]], [[Denis Williams]] and [[Aubrey Williams]].&lt;ref name=Kandasammy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Baksh /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lynch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Creighton /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16676">The '''celluloid ceiling''' is a [[metaphor]] for the underrepresentation of women in hiring and employment in [[Hollywood]]. The term reflects the metaphor of the "[[glass ceiling]]," which describes an invisible barrier that keeps a given demographic (typically women, although the term can apply to any [[protected group]]) from rising beyond a certain level in a hierarchy. [[Celluloid]] refers to the material used to make the [[film stock]] that was once used to make motion pictures. The term is usually applied to behind the screen workers only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1309&amp;context=jpur|title=A Sturdy Glass Ceiling:Representation of Women on Screen and Behind the Scenes of Hollywood’s Top 100 Films Throughout the Years|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=Fall 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Celluloid Ceiling'' Report ==
The celluloid ceiling is also the title of a series of reports created by Dr. Martha Lauzen at the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at [[San Diego State University]]. These reports have been compiled since 1998 to track employment statistics for women in Hollywood. The reports focus on behind the screen creative positions, also called above-the-line positions. These include: director, writer, producer, executive producer, editors, and cinematographers. As of 2018 the Center has yet to cultivate statistics on below-the-line (craft) positions. ''The Celluloid Ceiling'' reports have been produced since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/about-us/|title=About Us – Center for the Study of Women in Television &amp; Film|website=womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017_Celluloid_Ceiling_Report.pdf The 2017 Celluloid Ceiling Report]'' tracked employment statistics for top 100, 250, and 500 grossing non-reissue Hollywood films. The delineation of top 100 films and top 500 films are recent additions to the Center's data collection; the most complete historical data for comparison is from the top 250 category. For the top 250 films the report found that women account for 18% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers employed. This breaks down as:

* 25% of producers
* 19% of executive producers
* 16% of editors
* 11% of writers
* 11% of directors
* 4% of cinematographers&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/research/|title=Research – Center for the Study of Women in Television &amp; Film|website=womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistically, these numbers show that "only 1% of films employed 10 or more women in the above roles. In contrast, 70% of films employed 10 or more men."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== ACLU/EEOC Investigation ==
Based on "A large body of statistical evidence reveals dramatic disparities in the hiring of women directors in film and television,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2015/05/read-the-aclus-letter-to-the-eeoc-citing-employment-discrimination-against-women-directors-203573/#!|title=Read: The ACLU’s Letter to the EEOC Citing Employment Discrimination Against Women Directors|last=Kang|first=Inkoo|date=2015-05-27|work=IndieWire|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California|American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Southern California]] and the Women's Rights Project of [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU National]] sent letters to the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs asking that each entity open an investigation to the discrimination in hiring and underemployment of women directors in film and television. The fifteen page [https://www.aclusocal.org/filmequality letters], sent in May 2015, explicated five foundational roadblocks facing women directors:

*"studios’, networks’, and producers’ intentional and discriminatory failure to recruit, consider, and hire qualified women directors
*use of discriminatory recruiting and screening practices that have the effect of shutting women out, such as word-of-mouth recruiting and use of short lists on which women are under-represented;
*reliance on, and perpetuation of, sex stereotyping in hiring and evaluation of women;
*ineffective programs within the industry to increase hiring of women and people of color that do not lead to women getting directing jobs;
*lack of enforcement of internal industry agreements to increase the hiring of women and people of color."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2015/05/read-the-aclus-letter-to-the-eeoc-citing-employment-discrimination-against-women-directors-203573/#!|title=Read: The ACLU’s Letter to the EEOC Citing Employment Discrimination Against Women Directors|last=Kang|first=Inkoo|date=2015-05-27|work=IndieWire|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017 the EECO began "contacting female directors to investigate gender discrimination in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-women-directors-discrimination-investigation-20151002-story.html|title=The Hollywood gender discrimination investigation is on: EEOC contacts women directors|last=Keegan|first=Rebecca|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017 it was reported that the EEOC was in discussions with all major Hollywood studios to resolve systemic discrimination of women directors in hiring and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/02/hollywood-studios-female-directors-eeoc-investigation-1201912590/|title=EEOC: Major Studios Failed To Hire Female Directors; Lawsuit Looms|last=Robb|first=David|date=2017-02-15|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the EEOC investigation concerned women directors, changes in hiring and employment practices can impact women in Hollywood across positions.

== Advocacy to End the Celluloid Ceiling ==
A number of organizations have taken actions to highlight the contributions of women directors and advocate for their hiring. [[Vulture.com|Vulture]] released an [http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/100-women-directors-hollywood-should-be-hiring.html expansive list of 100  working women directors] available for hire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/100-women-directors-hollywood-should-be-hiring.html|title=100 Women Directors Hollywood Should Be Hiring|date=2015-11-02|work=Vulture|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular blog [https://cinema-fanatic.com/ Cinema Fanatic] chronicled the process of spending a year watching only films directed or co-directed by women, while challenging others to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cinema-fanatic.com/a-year-with-women/|title=A Year With Women|date=2015-01-10|work=the diary of a film history fanatic|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign took off on Twitter with the #AYearWithWomen and helped to start critical dialogue and increase awareness around a much wider-variety of women directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2015/07/female-directors-pick-their-favorite-films-made-by-women-186320/|title=Female Directors Pick Their Favorite Films Made by Women|last=Lattanzio|first=Ryan|date=2015-07-09|work=IndieWire|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;A similar campaign is currently promoted by [[Women in Film Los Angeles]].

'''''Charging Bull''''', which is sometimes referred to as the '''''Wall Street Bull''''' or the '''''Bowling Green Bull''''', is a [[bronze sculpture]] that stands in [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Originally [[guerrilla art]], installed unofficially by [[Arturo Di Modica]] and the Bedi-Makky Art Foundry, its popularity led to it being a permanent feature.

==Description==
The {{convert|7100|lb|kg|adj=on}} sculpture stands {{convert|11|ft|m}} tall&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/21/nyregion/the-bronze-bull-is-for-sale-but-there-are-a-few-conditions.html|title=The Bronze Bull Is for Sale, but There Are a Few Conditions|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|date=2004-12-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-13|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and measures {{convert|16|ft|m}} long.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/16/nyregion/soho-gift-to-wall-st-a-3-1-2-ton-bronze-bull.html|title=SoHo Gift to Wall St.: A 3 1/2-Ton Bronze Bull|last=Mcfadden|first=Robert D.|date=1989-12-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-13|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oversize sculpture depicts a [[bull]], the symbol of [[bull market|aggressive financial optimism and prosperity]], leaning back on its haunches and with its head lowered as if ready to charge. The sculpture is both a popular tourist destination which draws thousands of people a day, as well as "one of the most iconic images of New York"&lt;ref name="npbtt"&gt;Pinto Nick, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080908014825/http://tribecatrib.com/archives/newssept07/Bull.htm "Bull!"], article, September 1, 2007, ''The Tribeca Trib'', retrieved June 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and a "Wall Street icon"&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Beth and Robert Reid, Ginger Adams Otis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fbp_c-JIY-4C ''New York City''], p 120, publisher: Lonely Planet, 2006, {{ISBN|1-74059-798-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-74059-798-2}} retrieved via Google Books on June 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; symbolizing [[Wall Street]] and the Financial District.

In ''Outdoor Monuments of Manhattan: A Historical Guide'', Dianne Durante describes the sculpture:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Bull''{{'}}s head is lowered, its nostrils flare, and its wickedly long, sharp horns are ready to gore; it's an angry, dangerous beast. The muscular body twists to one side, and the tail is curved like a lash: the ''Bull'' is also energetic and in motion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1nMnB-2HgbwC&amp;pg=PA259|title=Outdoor Monuments of Manhattan: A Historical Guide|last=Durante|first=Dianne L.|date=2007-02-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814719862|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The bronze color and hard, metallic texture of the sculpture's surface emphasizes the brute force of the creature. The work was designed and placed so that viewers could walk around it, which also suggests the creature's own movement is unrestricted &amp;mdash; a point reinforced by the twisting posture of the bull's body, according to Durante.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Charging Bull'', then, shows an aggressive or even belligerent force on the move, but unpredictably. [...] [I]t's not far-fetched to say the theme is the energy, strength, and unpredictability of the stock market."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Di Modica told the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' in 1998:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That bull is one of an edition of five. &amp;hellip; I'm hoping the other four will be going to cities all over the world, whenever somebody buys them.&lt;ref name="dsrsdn"&gt;Singleton, Don, [http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/rock-solid-article-1.789714 "Rock Solid"], article, May 3, 1998, ''New York Daily News'', retrieved June 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2010, a similar [[Shanghai's Bull|''Charging Bull'']] sculpture by Di Modica was installed in [[Shanghai]] on commission by the Shanghai city authority; it is informally also called the ''[[The Bund|Bund]] Bull''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.make5crore.in|title=Shanghai unveils own version of ‘Charging Bull’|accessdate=May 17, 2010|date=May 16, 2010|publisher=BusinessWorld Publishing Corporation.}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Di Modica unofficially installed another charging bull sculpture outside the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] on [[Beurs van Berlage|Het Beursplein]], [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="nufoto"&gt;[http://www.nufoto.nl/fotos/293526/charging-bull-op-beursplein-in-amsterdam.html "Bronzen stier op Beursplein" (Bronze Bull on stock exchange square)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102021535/http://www.nufoto.nl/fotos/293526/charging-bull-op-beursplein-in-amsterdam.html |date=November 2, 2014 }}, article, July 5, 2012, ''Nu NL news photo report''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Stier Beursplein.JPG|thumb|''Charging Bull'' outside  the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]], the world’s first formal stock exchange.]]
=== Construction and installation ===
The bull was cast by the Bedi-Makky Art Foundry in [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]]. Di Modica spent some $360,000 to create, cast, and install the sculpture following the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 stock market crash]] as a symbol of the "strength and power of the American people".&lt;ref name="rdmsgw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/16/nyregion/soho-gift-to-wall-st-a-3-1-2-ton-bronze-bull.html|title=SoHo Gift to Wall St.: A 3½-Ton Bronze Bull|last=D. McFadden|first=Robert|date=1989-12-16|work=New York Times|accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was Di Modica's idea, and in an act of [[guerrilla art]], Bedi Makky Art Foundry and Di Modica trucked it to [[Lower Manhattan]]. On December 15, 1989, they installed it beneath a {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Christmas tree]] in the middle of [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Street]] in front of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] as a Christmas gift to New Yorkers. That day, hundreds of onlookers stopped to admire and analyze it as Di Modica handed out copies of a flier about his artwork.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

NYSE officials called police later that day, and the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] seized the sculpture and placed it into an [[Vehicle impoundment|impound lot]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The ensuing public outcry led the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]] to reinstall it two blocks south of the Exchange, in Bowling Green, with a ceremony on December 21, 1989.

===Confusion over ownership===
The sculpture technically has a temporary permit allowing it to stand on city property since the city does not own the sculpture, but the temporary permission has lasted since 1989, when city officials said the new location would not be permanent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/20/nyregion/wall-st-s-bronze-bull-moves-2-blocks-south.html?scp=15&amp;sq=Charging%20Bull&amp;st=cse "Wall St.'s Bronze Bull Moves 2 Blocks South"], Associated Press article, as printed in ''The New York Times'', December 20, 1989, retrieved June 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Art on loan is usually limited to a year's display, and although the city does not buy art, it does accept donations.&lt;ref name="blcsb"&gt;Lambert, Bruce, [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/nyregion/neighborhood-report-lower-manhattan-a-campaign-to-save-a-bull.html?scp=8&amp;sq=Charging%20Bull&amp;st=cse "Neighborhood Report: Lower Manhattan; A Campaign To Save a Bull"], article, ''The New York Times'', October 3, 1993, retrieved June 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A writer in the ''New York Daily News'' wrote in 1998 that the statue's placement was "beginning to look a mite permanent."&lt;ref name="dsrsdn" /&gt; According to an article in ''[[Art Monthly]]'', Di Modica, as well as officials and New Yorkers, "view it as a permanent feature of Lower Manhattan."&lt;ref&gt;Lydiate, Henry, [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-31229552_ITM "Public sculpture.(COPYRIGHT)", article, November 1, 2006, ''Art Monthly'', retrieved via the "Access My Library" website, June 13, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Di Modica announced that the bull sculpture was for sale, on condition the buyer does not move it from its present location. Di Modica continues to own the [[copyright|artistic copyright]] to the statue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2006, Di Modica sued [[Wal-Mart]] and other companies for illegally benefiting from his copyright, by selling replicas of the bull and using it in advertising campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20060921-1411-chargingbulllawsuit.html|title=Sculptor of Manhattan 'Charging Bull' statue sues Wal-Mart, others to protect its image|date=2006-09-21|agency=Associated Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901235518/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20060921-1411-chargingbulllawsuit.html|archivedate=2009-09-01|accessdate=2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Di Modica sued [[Random House]] for using a photo of the bull on the cover of a book discussing the collapse of financial services firm [[Lehman Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/22/business/fi-wrap22.1|title=Suit Alleges Illegal Use of `Charging Bull' Image|date=September 22, 2006|work=Los Angeles Times|agency=From Dow Jones/the Associated Press|accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution into tourist attraction===
[[File:Shooting Charging Bull 2.jpg|thumb|Tourists gathering around the ''Charging Bull''|left]]
As soon as the sculpture was set up at Bowling Green, it became "an instant hit."&lt;ref name=blcsb/&gt; One of the city's most photographed artworks, it has become a tourist destination in the Financial District. "Its popularity is beyond doubt", a ''New York Times'' article said of the artwork. "Visitors constantly pose for pictures around it." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Adrian Benepe, the New York City parks commissioner, said in 2004, "It's become one of the most visited, most photographed and perhaps most loved and recognized statues in the city of New York. I would say it's right up there with the [[Statue of Liberty]]."&lt;ref name="dwdbbfs"&gt;Dunlap, David W. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/21/nyregion/the-bronze-bull-is-for-sale-but-there-are-a-few-conditions.html "The Bronze Bull Is for Sale, but There Are a Few Conditions"], article, ''The New York Times'', December 21, 2004, retrieved June 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Arthur J. Piccolo, chairman of the Bowling Green Association, made the same point with the same comparison.&lt;ref name=blcsb/&gt; Henry J. Stern, the city parks commissioner when the statue first appeared in the Financial District, said in 1993: "People are crazy about the bull. It captured their imagination."&lt;ref name=blcsb/&gt;

The statue's popularity with tourists has international appeal. One 2007 newspaper report noted a "ceaseless stream" of visitors from India, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Venezuela, and China, as well as the United States. Children enjoy climbing on the bull,&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, Carl, [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/26/travel/q-and-a-325191.html?scp=27&amp;sq=Charging%20Bull&amp;st=cse "Q and A"], May 26, 1991, ''The New York Times'', October 3, 1993, retrieved June 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; which sits "famously"&lt;ref name="bglpnyc"&gt;Durante, Dianne L., [https://books.google.com/books?id=1nMnB-2HgbwC&amp;pg=PA259 ''Outdoor monuments of Manhattan: a historical guide''], NYU Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-8147-1987-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8147-1987-9}}, retrieved via Google Books on June 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; at street level on the cobblestones at the far northern tip of the small park.

One visitor told a newspaper reporter it was a reason for his visit.&lt;ref name=npbtt/&gt;

In addition to having their pictures taken at the front end of the bull, many tourists pose at the back of the bull, near the large [[testicle]]s "for snapshots under an unmistakable symbol of its virility."&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap, David W., [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/nyregion/17bull.html?_r=1&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=Charging%20Bull&amp;st=cse ''Downtown’s Bull, No Longer Emblematic, Remains Popular''], September 16, 2008, ''The New York Times'', retrieved June 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article in 2002, "People on The Street say you've got to rub the nose, horns and testicles of the bull for good luck, tour guide Wayne McLeod would tell the group on the Baltimore bus, who would giddily oblige."&lt;ref&gt;Duke, Lynn, "The Pilgrimage To Ground Zero &amp;mdash; Officials and Tourists Walk A Fine Line on Solemn Ground", ''[[Washington Post]]'', February 27, 2002, Edition F, page C1, accessed via newsbank.com subscription archive website (also on High Beam Research subscription archive website) on May 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 ''New York Times'' article said, "Passers-by have rubbed&amp;mdash;to a bright gleam&amp;mdash;its nose, horns and a part of its anatomy that, as Mr. Benepe put it gingerly, 'separates the bull from the steer.'"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A 2007 newspaper account agreed that a "peculiar ritual" of handling the "shining orbs" of the statue's [[scrotum]] seems to have developed into a tradition. One visitor, from Mississippi, told the ''[[Tribeca Trib]]'' she did it "for good luck", and because "there's a kind of primal response when you see something like that. You just have to engage it."&lt;ref name="npbtt" /&gt; The enthusiastic reaction to the sculpture continues into the darker hours. "I've seen people do some crazy things to that bull", said a souvenir vendor, "At night sometimes, when people have been drinking, I’ve seen them do stuff to that bull that you couldn’t print in a newspaper."&lt;ref name="npbtt" /&gt;

=== Placement of ''Fearless Girl'' === 
{{main article|Fearless Girl}}
On March 7, 2017, the night before [[International Women's Day]], another bronze sculpture, ''[[Fearless Girl]]'', was placed directly in front of ''Charging Bull''.

==Criticism==
[[File:Wall-Street-1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A poster showing a ballerina on the ''Charging Bull'' to promote the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement]]

''Charging Bull'' has often been a subject of criticism from an [[Criticism of capitalism|anti-capitalist]] perspective. The [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests used the bull as a symbolic figure around which to direct their critiques of corporate greed. A 2011 image from ''[[Adbusters]]'' portraying a dancer posed in an attitude position atop the sculpture was used to promote the forthcoming protests.&lt;ref name="inline.poster"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The Link (newspaper)|The Link]]|title=The Ballerina and the Bull: Adbusters’ Micah White on ‘The Last Great Social Movement’|first=Laura|last=Beeston|date=October 11, 2011|url=http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/1951|accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first gathering of Occupy took place around the sculpture on September 17, 2011, before moving to [[Zuccotti Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/09/17/technology/occupy_wall_street/index.htm|title=Hundreds of protesters descend to 'Occupy Wall Street'|last=Pepitone|first=Julianne|website=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the protests, the bull was surrounded by barricades and guarded by police&lt;ref&gt;Harshbarger, Rebecca and Frank Rosario.

The ''Charging Bull'' has been likened to the [[golden calf]] worshiped by the [[Israelites]] during their [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt. During Occupy Wall Street on multiple occasions an interfaith group of religious leaders led a procession of a golden calf figure that was modeled on the bull.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/donna-schaper/occupy-wall-street-the-go_b_1004946.html|title=Occupy Wall Street, The Golden Calf And The New Idolatry|last=Schaper|first=Donna|date=2011-10-11|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Z9EAgAAQBAJ|title=Religion, Theology, and Class: Fresh Engagements after Long Silence|last=Rieger|first=J|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=1137339241|location=|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large [[papier-mâché]] [[piñata]] made by Sebastian Errazuriz for a 2014 New York design festival was intended to be reminiscent of both the golden calf and ''Charging Bull''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/anti-capitalist-golden-cow-pinata-sculpture-rains-cash-in-brooklyn-27270|title=Anti-Capitalist Golden Cow Piñata Sculpture Rains Cash in Brooklyn|last=Cascone|first=Sarah|date=May 27, 2014|work=Artnet|access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meetsebastian.com/sebastian-errazuriz-design-art-wallstreet-money-pinata-installation/|title=SI_BULL|website=www.meetsebastian.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further comparisons to the golden calf have been made by Jewish and Christian religious commentators.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|last1=Badcock|first1=Gary D.|title=God and the Financial Crisis: Essays on Faith, Economics, and Politics in the Wake of the Great Recession|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443888370|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CD5DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA11 |accessdate=12 April 2017}}

The '''coat of arms of [[Gabon]]''' was designed by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[heraldist]] and [[vexillologist]] Louis Mühlemann, one of the founding members of the [[International Federation of Vexillological Associations|FIAV]] and also designer of the former [[Coat of arms of the Republic of the Congo|coat of arms of Congo]]. It has been in use since 15 July 1963.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briggs|first1=Geoffrey|title=National Heraldry of the World|date=1974|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York|isbn=9780670504527}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Description==
The supporters of the symbol are [[Leopard (heraldry)|panther]]s which symbolize the vigilance and courage of the president who protects the nation. The bezants (golden discs) in chief of the shield symbolize the mineral wealth of the country.&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; The ship at the lower part represents [[Gabon]] moving towards a brighter future.&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; According to Briggs,&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; "green represents the great dense forests; yellow, the sun; blue, the sea; and black, the people of Africa". The [[Aucoumea klaineana|okoumé tree]] at the top of the shield symbolizes the timber trade.&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; 

The coat of arms is unusual in having two ribbons with mottos in two different languages. The ribbon below the shield has a motto in French 'UNION, TRAVAIL, JUSTICE' ('Unity, Work, Justice'). The second ribbon is placed beneath the branches of the [[Aucoumea klaineana|okoumé tree]] and has a motto in Latin 'UNITI PROGREDIEMUR' ('We shall go forward united').

'''Colombian art''' has 3500 years of history and covers a wide range of media and styles ranging from Spanish [[Baroque]] devotional painting to [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]] gold craftwork to the "lyrical americanism" of painter [[Alejandro Obregón]] (1920–1992).  Perhaps the most internationally acclaimed [[Colombian artists|Colombian artist]] is painter and sculptor [[Fernando Botero]] (1932).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/colombia/articles/the-art-of-fernando-botero-colombia-s-most-colombian-artist/|title=The Art of Fernando Botero: Colombia’s ‘Most Colombian’ Artist|first=Helen|last=Armitage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-Columbian sculpture ==&lt;!--pre-Columbian refers to the time before Christopher Columbus, who Colombia is named after - see the article [[pre-Columbian era]]--&gt;

=== Pottery ===
There is archaeological evidence that ceramics were produced on Colombia's Caribbean coast earlier than anywhere in the Americas outside of the lower [[Amazon Basin]]. [[Ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Tempers|Fiber-tempered]] ceramics associated with shell middens appeared at sites such as [[Puerto Hormiga archaeological site|Puerto Hormiga]], Monsú, Puerto Chacho, and San Jacinto by 3100&amp;nbsp;BC. Fiber-tempered ceramics at Monsú have been dated to 5940 radiocarbon years [[Before Present|before present]]. The fiber-tempered pottery at Puerto Hormiga was "crude", formed from a single lump of clay. The fiber-tempered pottery at San Jacinto is described as "well-made". Sand-tempered coiled ceramics have also been found at Puerto Hormiga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walthall|first=John A.|title=Prehistoric Indians of the Southeast: Archaeology of Alabama and the Middle South|year=1980|publisher=The University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama|isbn=0-8173-0552-1|pages=81–83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s86X6CHyEyUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Prehistoric+Indians+of+the+Southeast:+Archaeology+of+Alabama+and+the+Middle+South&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6De3TtitL5K2tgfsn7HRAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Peregrine|first1=Peter N.|authorlink1=Peter N.

The Piartal culture (750–1250 AD) in the mountainous region on the [[Colombia–Ecuador border]] produced unique methods of producing pottery as well as patterns inspired by animal or snake skin. Vessels were created for use in secondary burial, or the practice of allowing the flesh to decompose and then reburying the bones. These vessels were also used to hold relics and jewelry belonging to the deceased.&lt;ref name=BMA&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=89|url=http://artsbma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goldwork ===
The earliest examples of gold craftsmanship have been attributed to the Tumaco people of the Pacific coast and date to around 325 BCE.  Gold would play a pivotal role in luring the Spanish to the area now called Colombia during the 16th century (See: [[El Dorado]]).

One of the most valued artifacts of Pre-Columbian&lt;!--This is NOT a typo. Before Christopher Columbus, not before Colombia --&gt; goldwork is the so-called ''[[Poporo Quimbaya]]'', a small (23.5 × 11.4&amp;nbsp;cm), hollow, devotional object (used to ''mambeo'' or [[coca leaf]] chewing ritual) made of gold whose aesthetic harmony, simple elegance, and mathematical symmetry are striking and almost modern.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The [[Museo del Oro]] in [[Bogotá]] displays the most important collection of pre-Columbian&lt;!--This is NOT a typo. Before Christopher Columbus, not before Colombia --&gt; gold handicraft in the Americas.

=== Stone ===
Roughly between 200 BCE and 800 CE, the San Agustín culture, masters of stonecutting, entered its “classical period".  They erected raised ceremonial centres, sarcophagi, and large stone [[monolith]]s depicting anthropomorphic and zoomorphhic forms out of stone.  Some of these have been up to five meters high.

Related to the San Agustín culture were the inhabitants of ''[[Tierradentro]]'' (“inner land”, so called because of its inaccessibility) who created over one hundred and fifty underground tombs, or hypogea; their walls and ceilings were richly decorated with geometric forms recalling the interior of palm huts.  Also in the tombs were found funeral urns, bowls, and pitchers.

== Modern sculpture ==
The Colombian sculpture from the sixteenth to 18th centuries was mostly devoted to religious depictions of ecclesiastic art, strongly influenced by the Spanish schools of sacred sculpture. During the early period of the Colombian republic, the national artists were focused in the production of sculptural portraits of politicians and public figures, in a plain [[neoclassicist]] trend. During the 20th century, the Colombian sculpture began to develop a bold and innovative work with the aim of reaching a better understanding of national sensitivity.  {{commons category|Fernando Botero|Plaza Botero}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Colombian colonial art includes altar wood carving masterpieces and the statues for religious processions.

=== Colonial period ===
Painting in the colonial period reflected the power and prestige of the Catholic Church and the Spanish aristocracy in Colombia or as it was then known [[New Kingdom of Granada|The New Kingdom of Granada]] (c. 1548-1717) and later [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|The Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (1717–1819).

==== Early colonial period ====
[[File:Virgen de chiquinquira2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá]]'' (flanked by [[St. Anthony of Padua]] and [[St. Andrew|St. Andrew the Apostle]]) by Alonso de Narváez, tempura on rustic cloth, 16th century]]
Colombian painting in the early colonial period (1530s–1650) was mostly ecclesiastical in subject and based on [[mannerist]], [[renaissance]], and [[medieval]] styles, with some minor influence from indigenous culture.

Spanish explorers first set foot on Colombian soil in 1499 and established [[Santa Marta]], the first city and government in the territory of Colombia, in 1599.  King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabela of Castille had in 1492 year unified Spain and conquered the remaining [[Moors|Moorish]] stronghold in southern Spain (Granada); expelled Jews with the [[Alhambra Decree]] and continued the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]]; and sent [[Christopher Columbus]] on his first expedition.  It is from this context of ''[[reconquista]]'' or the Christianizing of the Iberian peninsula that the similarly strongly Catholic colonial project in the Americas might be understood.  In this period, Spain and Portugal were the greatest powers in Europe and the most dogged defenders (and enforcers) of [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]].

Workshops in [[Seville, Spain|Seville]] produced many of the early paintings sent to Colombia.  Colombian artists in this period were mostly considered common tradesmen, like [[shoemaking|cobblers]] or [[cooper (profession)|coopers]].  As throughout much of the history of art around the world, these usually anonymous artisans produced work that served the ideological needs of their patrons, in this case the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church]].

The churches and homes of wealthy families in the main towns of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] contain some of the oldest extant examples of colonial art in Colombia, mostly in the form of [[mural painting]].

The first colonial-era painter to work in Colombia, or as it was then known as, [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|Nueva Granada]], was the [[Seville, Spain|Seville]] native Alonso de Narváez (d. 1583).  He is credited with painting an image of the Virgin Mary ([[Our Lady of the Rosary]]) that later became itself an object of devotion, known as [[Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá]] thanks to, as Catholics believe, a miraculous repairing of the painting's fabric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/mary0007.htm]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|''Holy Trinity'' by Gregorio Vázquez de Arce y Ceballos, oil on canvas, 17th century]]

==== Baroque period ====
'''Baroque art''' (starting in Rome around 1600), including [[Latin American Baroque]] (1650-1750 [[:es:Gregorio Vásquez de Arce y Ceballos]]), tended towards emotionalism, an appeal to [[populism]], and large gestures and flowing garments.  In line with the Counter-Reformation a generation prior, the [[Jesuit]]s, an order formed to counter [[Protestantism]], were the first to embrace the [[Baroque]].  The major influences on Colombian artists in this period were Spanish Baroque painters like [[Francisco de Zurbarán]] (1580–1664), as well as Flemish, Italian, and also Quito and Cuzco influences, through engravings and various original images imported for churches and monasteries.

Another Seville native, Baltasar de Figueroa ''El Viejo'' (1629–1667), settled in [[Bogotá]] in the early 17th century and set up an artist's workshop.  He and his many descendants would be prolific and would invent a kind of creolized Colombian form of Baroque painting that combined the borrowing of forms and subjects from European engravings (mostly religious in nature: saints in various states of mortification or ecstasy, the Virgin Mary, or Christ) with native motifs and decoration.  But it would be one of the Figueroa family's apprentices, Gregorio Vázquez de Arce y Ceballos, who would stand out among all painters of the colonial era.

'''[[Gregorio Vasquez de Arce y Ceballos]]''' (1638–1711) is considered the greatest master of the colonial period.  In his lifetime he produced around five hundred paintings, mostly devotional, with a technique that juxtaposed figures taken from paintings by European masters using innovative materials found in the New World.  His depictions of the Trinity as a single figure with four eyes and three faces, an innovation unique to Latin America, would be later condemned as heretical in part because they resembled Hindu deities.

The '''[[Sopo Archangels]]''' is a series of twelve paintings, each featuring an [[archangel]] (three canonical, plus eight apocryphal, and one guardian) engulfed in a tenebrous (cloudy) background.  Their figures are life-sized, clad in rich apparel, full of drapes and folds, and are meant to be "read" through their various iconography.  Like many depictions of angels, these ostensibly male figures are depicted with soft, feminine faces and round hips.  The origin of this series is unknown, as is the artist.  It is considered one of the enduring enigmas of Colombian art.

==== The ''Virreinato'' and rococo ====
The raising of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717 coincided roughly with the ascension of the Bourbons to the throne of Spain.  This period marked a period of resurgence and the first sparks of [[Enlightenment Spain|Enlightenment in Spain]]. [[Rococo]], a decadent form, replaced baroque as the dominant style.  The new viceroy court in Bogotá led to a surge in demand for portraits of civilians and clergymen.  The leading portrait painter of this period was Joaquín Guttiérrez.  He depicted members of the aristocracy in frozen forms, surrounded by richly embellished furniture and decoration, and usually printed the subject's name and family title beneath their image.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== 20th century and modernism ===
From 1920 to 1940, [[Marco Tobón Mejía]], José Horacio Betancur, [[Pedro Nel Gómez]], [[Ignacio Gómez Jaramillo]], [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] and Alipio Jaramillo produced several mural paintings influenced by the Mexican muralists, with [[Neoclassicism|neoclassic]] features and influences of [[Art Nouveau]].  During the 1940s, a raising internacional disinterest in the Colombian art caused to the local artis to try new ways of expression such as [[post-impressionism]] and French scholar style.  An example of this is the landscape painter Ricardo Gómez Campuzano and his depictions of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]].

Several art critics point to the 1950s as the time when Colombian art started to have a distinctive point of view, reinventing the traditional elements under the 20th century concepts.  Examples of this are the Greiff portraits by Ignacio Gomez Jaramillo, showing what the Colombian art could do with the new techniques applied to typical Colombian themes. Carlos Correa, with his paradigmathic  “Naturaleza muerta en silencio” (silent dead nature), combines geometrical abstraction and [[cubism]] in a style still recurrent today in many artists. Pedro Nel Gómez, in his “Autorretrato con sombrero” (1941) (self-portrait with hat) shows influences from [[Gauguin]] and [[Van Gogh]].  He also shows a strong influence of José Clemente Orozco in his series about the ''Barequeras'' (women extracting gold from the rivers banks) and his self-portrait (1949) shows strong influences from [[Cézanne]]. [[Alejandro Obregón]] is often considered as the father of modern Colombian painting, and one of the most influential artist in this period, due to his originality, the painting of Colombian landscapes with symbolic and expressionist use of animals, (specially the [[andean condor]]). In his work is noticeable the influences of [[Picasso]] and [[Graham Sutherland]]. Currently, some of the most recognized painters in the international scene are [[Fernando Botero]] and [[Omar Rayo]].

{{Main|Theater of Colombia}}
'''Theater''' was introduced '''in Colombia''' during the Spanish colonization in 1550 through [[zarzuela]] companies. Colombian theater is supported by the Ministry of Culture and a number of private and state owned organizations. Among the most important organizations are the National Association of Scenic Directors (ANDE), Performing Arts Workers Associations, Antioquia Storytellers Association, Colombian Association of Critique and Theater Research (ACIT), Puppeteers Associations (ATICO), Colombian Corporation of Theater among others.

Colombian theater was introduced during the [[Spanish colonization|colonization]] by the Spanish between 1550 and 1810. At the end of the 19th century and beginnings of the 20th century the most important center of theater in Colombia was the Colon theater in downtown Bogota. These theaters were built resembling Italian architecture style. During the 20th century interest for theater had spread all over Colombia and many theater were built in the biggest cities of Colombia. Colombia currently holds one of the biggest theater festivals in the world, properly called the Ibero-American Theater Festival. As in many other parts of the world, future actors and actresses begin their performing experience in theater many of them with the goal of making it to television or film. Theater in Colombia is informally known as "tablas" (woods) because of the wooden stages on which actors perform their plays. Colombia has a mature system of theater companies which reaches an audience mostly in the city of Bogota.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4501">The '''color killer''' is an electronic stage in color [[TV]] receiver sets which acts as a cutting circuit to cut off the color amplifiers when the TV receives a [[monochrome]] signal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/color+killer+circuit thefreedictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monochromatic transmission ==
When a receiver is tuned to a monochrome transmission, the displayed scene should have no color components. However, there are two factors which result in color display even during monochrome transmission:
* a high frequency component of the luminance signal
* a high frequency of external noise

When the frequencies of these signals equals the frequency of the color subcarrier wave, they may create an irritating color dot pattern like ''confetti'', which interferes with the monochrome picture.

== Color transmission ==
In a color TV waveform, a reference pulse, called the [[colorburst|burst]],{{efn|name=burst}} is transmitted along the [[back porch]] portion of the video signal. If the transmitted signal is monochromatic, then the burst is not transmitted. The color killer is actually a muting circuit in the chroma section which supervises the burst and turns off the color amplifiers if no burst is received (i.e. when the received signal is monochromatic.)&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Grob-Charles E.Herndon:''Basic television and Video systems'', Glanceo McGraw Hill, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-02-800437-2}}, p. 456–458.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equation ==
In [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]] transmissions, the color TV signal can be represented as:{{efn|name=SECAM}}

:&lt;math&gt;E(t) = E_y(t)+ a_1\cdot(E_b(t)-E_y(t))\cdot \sin(\omega t)+ a_2\cdot(E_r(t)-E_y(t))\cdot \cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; are attenuation factors, &lt;math&gt;E_y &lt;/math&gt; is the [[luminance]] signal, &lt;math&gt;(E_b-E_y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(E_r-E_y)&lt;/math&gt; are the so-called color difference signals and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency of the color carrier. &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is within the luminance bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;For more complete equation see ''Reference Data for Radio Engineers'', Howard W. Sams Co, {{ISBN|978-0-672-21218-5}}, pp. 30–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color eraser (''Mehikon'') ==
In the '70s, the Israeli government considered the import of color televisions as frivolous and a luxury that would increase social gaps. Therefore, the government ordered the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]] to cease broadcasting in color.  As it was impractical to strip out the chrominance signal from material recorded in color, this was accomplished by simply omitting the [[burst phase]] signal from the broadcast.  The "damaged" signal triggered the "color killer" mechanism, installed in color TV sets to prevent the appearance of color. This method was named ''Mehikon'' ({{lang-he|מחיקון}} "eraser").

Soon after its introduction of the "Color eraser", special TV sets with an ''Anti-Mehikon'' ({{lang-he|אנטי-מחיקון}} "anti-eraser") device were offered. This device re-constructed the burst phase signal according to several known standards. The client had to turn a knob until the pictures on the screen appeared in natural colors. According to a report in ''[[Yediot Aharonoth]]'' from January 1979,&lt;ref&gt;Report from 19 January 1979 by Leah Etgar on Yediot Aharonot's economic supplement ("HaLirot Shelkha"), partially cited in "The Future that was: Anti-Mekhikon", a historical review by Gal Mor, [[Ynet]], 7 June 2004 (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; clients had to adjust the knob every 15 minutes on average in normal conditions, or up to 10 times an hour when special problems occurred, in order to restore natural colors or if the picture suddenly turned black and white.

Based on information from owners of electricity appliance stores, the report estimated that 90% of those who bought color TV sets also bought the ''Anti-Mehikon'' device, which added about 5–10% to the price of the television.

Eventually, the Mehikon idea was proven to be futile, and the Israeli television stopped using it in 1980, allowing color transmissions to be received freely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46540">'''Copyright Alert System''' ('''CAS''') was a voluntary industry effort to educate and penalize internet users who engage in the unauthorized and unlawful distribution of [[copyright]]ed works via [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] services. The program was operated by the [[Center for Copyright Information]], a consortium consisting of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), and the [[internet service provider]]s [[AT&amp;T]], [[Cablevision]], [[Comcast]], [[Time Warner Cable]], and [[Verizon]].&lt;ref name=farivar&gt;{{cite news

The CAS used a [[graduated response]] system (also known as the '''"six strikes program"'''), in which participating ISPs would send warnings notifying subscribers of alleged copyright infringement, as reported by a monitoring service working on behalf of participating copyright owners.&lt;ref name="cci_press_release"&gt;Brimmeier, Khristyn.

After a fifth warning, ISPs were allowed to implement "mitigation measures", which could include penalties such as [[bandwidth throttling]] or preventing web access until customers "discuss the matter" with their ISP.&lt;ref name="agreementars"&gt;{{cite web | last = Anderson | first = Nate | title = Major ISPs agree to "six strikes" copyright enforcement plan | publisher = Ars Technica | date = July 7, 2011 | url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/07/major-isps-agree-to-six-strikes-copyright-enforcement-plan/ | accessdate = 2013-02-26 }}

The CAS framework was established on July 7, 2011 after three years in the making.&lt;ref name="cci_press_release" /&gt; After multiple delays, ISPs began implementing it in late February 2013.&lt;ref name="implementationrollout"&gt;{{cite web | last = Farivar | first = Cyrus | title = "Six strikes" enforcement policy debuts | publisher = Ars Technica | date = Feb 25, 2013 | url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/02/six-strikes-enforcement-policy-debuts/ | accessdate = 2013-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lesser|first=Jill|title=Copyright Alert System Set to Begin|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/uncategorized/copyright-alert-system-set-to-begin/|work=Center For Copyright Information|publisher=Center For Copyright Information|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAS discontinued the program on January 30, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIP, "Six Strikes" Copyright Alert System|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/01/rip-six-strikes-copyright-alert-system/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Center for Copyright Information employed the services of [[MarkMonitor]] (often doing business as DtecNet) to detect and monitor suspected copyright infringement activity.&lt;ref name=EFF201211&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/us-copyright-surveillance-machine-about-be-switched-on |title=U.S. Copyright Surveillance Machine About To Be Switched On, Promises of Transparency Already Broken |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=15 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although MarkMonitor monitored many infringement venues, in early 2013 the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) said it appeared that for purposes of the CAS, the company will only monitor peer-to-peer traffic from public [[BitTorrent tracker]]s.&lt;ref name=EFF_FAQ&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/six-strikes-copyright-alert-system-faq&lt;/ref&gt; The Copyright Alert System does not use [[deep packet inspection]].&lt;ref name=mueller-kuehn-santoso/&gt;{{rp|361}}

A review of MarkMonitor's system for the CAS stated that only uploads were monitored, with infringement being suspected when MarkMonitor's BitTorrent client successfully obtains pieces of known-infringing content from a peer in the swarm. The pieces were compared to pieces from an already-downloaded copy of the content, which had already been matched to content samples supplied by the copyright owners.&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt;

When suspected infringement was detected, the ISP for the [[IP address]] associated with the suspicious activity was notified. The ISP, in turn, notified the subscriber to whom the IP address was assigned at the time of the alleged infringement, informing the subscriber that their account was suspected of being used to infringe copyright, and warning of potential consequences. Users who continue to receive warnings could be issued up to six alerts in the form of pop-up messages and e-mails before stronger measures were taken by the ISP.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Intent==
The Copyright Alert System was intended to be {{cquote|a consumer-focused process for identifying and notifying residential wired Internet access service customers of the participating ISPs (other than dial-up subscribers) who receive multiple notifications of allegations of online infringement made via P2P networks and applications, in an effort to educate consumers, deter online infringement, and direct consumers to lawful online legitimate sources of content online.&lt;ref name=MOU/&gt;}}

The Center for Copyright Information believed that the Copyright Alert System would be effective in reducing both intentional and unintentional copyright infringement. By providing willing infringers with information regarding the serious consequences of copyright infringement, the CCI hoped to steer would-be infringers to legal online content providers. The CCI hoped that unwitting infringers, such as those whose home networks have been hijacked by unauthorized users or the parents of children who are infringing, would use the knowledge that their account is being used for copyright infringement to force users of the account to curtail these activities. The CCI also hoped to increase parents' involvement in what their children are doing online by alerting misconduct and abuse of their accounts.&lt;ref name="FlintLATimes"&gt;Joe Flint, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/07/entertainment-giants-and-broadband-providers-team-up-on-piracy-effort.html "Entertainment giants and broadband providers team up on piracy effort"], Los Angeles Times, July 6, 2011. Retrieved November 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFF claimed the materials used to "educate consumers" were "more like propaganda", and that the framework violated the principle of [[presumption of innocence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/us-copyright-surveillance-machine-about-be-switched-on|date=November 15, 2012|title=U.S. Copyright Surveillance Machine About To Be Switched On, Promises of Transparency Already Broken|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alerts==
The system of alerts was as follows:

* The first and second alerts notified ISP subscribers that their Internet account has allegedly been used for copyright infringement, provided an explanation of how to avoid future offenses, and directed users to lawful content sites.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;
* If the suspicious behavior persisted, additional alerts were sent. These alerts ask the subscriber to acknowledge receipt of the messages by clicking a notice.
* After a fifth alert, ISPs were allowed to take "mitigation measures" to prevent future infringement.
* If the ISP did not institute a mitigation measure following the fifth alert, it had to enact one after the sixth alert.

Mitigation measures included: "temporary reductions of Internet speeds, redirection to a landing page until the subscriber contacts the ISP to discuss the matter or reviews and responds to some educational information about copyright, or other measures (as specified in published policies) that the ISP may deem necessary to help resolve the matter".&lt;ref name="FAQs"&gt;[http://www.copyrightinformation.org/faq Center for Copyright Information FAQs] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66gWCLxtq?url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/faq |date=2012-04-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mitigation measures varied by company. [[Verizon]] was the first to reveal their mitigation policy. Their policy specified that violators with more than three alerts would be directed to an online copyright law information. Upon a fifth or sixth alert, the user would experience a temporary speed reduction down to 256kbit/s (approximately the speed of dial-up internet access).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Kevin|title=LEAKED: Verizon's New Anti-Piracy Measure Will Give Offenders 6 Chances|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-anti-piracy-gives-6-chances-2013-1|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a leaked internal document, [[AT&amp;T]] decided that after a 6th alert, a user's "access to many of the most frequently visited websites [would be] restricted" until they completed an "online educational tutorial on copyright".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Jeff|title=AT&amp;T Could Block Facebook, The Pirate Bay And Others When 'Six Strike' Program Begins Next Month|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/att-could-block-facebook-pirate-bay-others-when-six-strike-program-begins-next-month-845709|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[AT&amp;T]] later explained that it would not cut the user off the internet even though such measure appeared in the copyright warning letter. It gave a reason that the six strikes warnings are only allegations; therefore, if the alleged user was still suspected of illegal downloading after completion of the "online educational tutorial on copyright" and the six strikes warnings, unless the copyright owner took legal action; nothing would happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bort|first=Julie|title=AT&amp;T Promises (Again) Not To Disconnect Your Account If It Suspects You Of Illegal Downloading|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/att-wont-disconnect-over-six-strikes-2013-9|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Warner Cable]] stated that it would not discontinue customers' service, but instead redirect users to educational pages on copyright law upon multiple violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|title=Cable companies say they won't disconnect accused pirates|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57550782-38/cable-companies-say-they-wont-disconnect-accused-pirates/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCI said that at no point in the process would the ISPs reveal customer information to the CCI, the monitoring service, or the copyright owners.&lt;ref name=cas-faqs&gt;{{cite web|title=Copyright Alert System FAQs|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/resources-faq/copyright-alert-system-faqs/|work=The Copyright Alert System|publisher=Center for Copyright Information|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFF said that because the system "will not identify those who take steps to anonymize their Internet traffic using a VPN or Tor" it would not stop dedicated infringers.&lt;ref name=EFF_FAQ/&gt;

The EFF also argued that the mitigation measures to be undertaken by ISPs in response to alleged copyright infringement were overly harsh, as they could be used to deny consumers access to the Internet, which EFF maintained is as fundamental a right in the digital era as access to other utilities such as electricity.&lt;ref name="EFFReaction" /&gt; Annemarie Bridy wrote that although temporary suspension was a possible mitigation measure, market pressure would discourage ISPs from using it, instead relying on more educational measures.&lt;ref name=bridy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bridy|first=Annemarie|title=Graduated Response American Style: "Six Strikes" Measured Against Five Norms|journal=Fordham Intellectual Property, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Journal|year=2012|volume=23|pages=1–66|ssrn=2145059|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39–40}} Mueller, Kuehn, and Santoso attributed the ISPs' adoption of the Copyright Alert System to its voluntary nature and the fact the ISPs were not required to terminate accounts under the Copyright Alert System.&lt;ref name=mueller-kuehn-santoso /&gt;{{rp|361}}

==Appeal process==
The CAS process did not allow alerts to be challenged until a mitigation measure was about to be imposed.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent&gt;{{cite web|title=What Do I Do if I Think the Alert Was Wrongly Sent|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/the-copyright-alert-system/what-do-i-do-if-i-think-the-alert-was-wrongly-sent/|work=The Copyright Alert System|publisher=Center for Copyright Information|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the subscriber could request, through a special link provided by their ISP, a special [[arbitration]] proceeding.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; The proceeding would be administered by the [[American Arbitration Association]] (AAA),&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; and the arbitrator would be selected by the AAA.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|33}} The process was "automated to the maximum extent practicable",&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|33}} with the intent of resolving the dispute within thirty days of filing.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|37}}

The appeal had to be requested within 14 days of the alert triggering the mitigation measure.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; The subscriber had to pay a $35 filing fee, unless the fee was waived by the AAA.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; According to CCI Executive Director Jill Lesser, the $35 fee "defray[ed] a small part of the cost of the appeal and [was] intended to discourage frivolous appeals".&lt;ref name=congressional-internet-caucus&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Congressional Internet Caucus Meets on Copyright and Piracy|url=http://www.c-span.org/Events/Congressional-Internet-Caucus-Meets-on-Copyright-and-Piracy/10737438657-1/ |accessdate=2013-05-12 |time=19:52 |publisher=C-SPAN| date=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevail, the subscriber had to successfully challenge a specified number of alerts (possibly more than one) to block the mitigation measure and receive a refund of the filing fee.&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt;

Subscribers could only challenge alerts on one or more of the following pre-defined grounds:&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt;&lt;ref name="review-grounds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/resources-faq/independent-review-faqs/what-are-the-grounds-for-requesting-a-review/ |title=What are the Grounds for Requesting a Review? |publisher=Center for Copyright Information |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Misidentification of Account – The subscriber's account was incorrectly identified as a source of copyright infringement.
* Unauthorized Use of Account – The alleged infringement was the result of unauthorized, unpreventable use of the subscriber's account by others, without the subscriber's knowledge.
* Authorization – The subscriber's use of the work identified in the alert was specifically authorized in writing by the work's copyright owner or someone with a license to reproduce the work.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|36}}
* Fair Use – The subscriber's use of the work identified in the alert meets the U.S. legal definition of [[fair use]].
* Misidentification of File – The file "did not consist primarily of the alleged copyrighted work at issue but rather contained other non-infringing material".
* Work Published Before 1923 – The work identified in the alert was published prior to 1923 and therefore is in the [[public domain]] in the United States.

In an appeal, the burden of proof was on the subscriber to demonstrate the elements of one of the above grounds for challenging an alert.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|34}}

The choice of defenses allowed in an appeal was criticized. The defense of unauthorized use of account was not allowed if the user was a member of the subscriber's household or an invitee, and after the first assertion of this defense, the subscriber had to demonstrate by "clear and convincing evidence" that the subscriber "took reasonable steps to secure the account following the first occurrence of unauthorized use".&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|35}} Bridy wrote that this creates an obligation for subscribers to secure their Internet connection even when they had no legal or contractual obligation to do so.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|35–36}} In an ''Ars Technica'' article, Cyrus Farivar said that the responsibility placed on the subscriber by the CAS for copyright infringement that occurred using the subscriber's connection would harm the availability of open Wi-Fi that small businesses make available to their customers.&lt;ref name=farivar /&gt; In a CCI blog post, Jill Lesser responded that many businesses with open Wi-Fi had business accounts, which were not subject to the CAS. Lesser also said that businesses offering open Wi-Fi through residential accounts would be subject to the CAS, but those accounts, like others subject to the CAS, would not be subject to termination.&lt;ref name=lesser&gt;{{cite web|last=Lesser|first=Jill|title=CAS Will Not Harm Public Wi-Fi|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/uncategorized/cas-will-not-harm-public-wi-fi/|publisher=Center for Copyright Information|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense of publication before 1923 was the only allowable challenge to the copyright status of a work, even though a work may have been out of copyright protection for other reasons.&lt;ref name=EFF_FAQ /&gt;&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|36}} LaFrance criticized the presence of the "work published before 1923" defense but not other factual challenges to the copyright status of the work that she said could just as easily be resolved through the appeal process.&lt;ref name=lafrance /&gt;{{rp|178}}

The subscriber's personal information was not shared with the copyright holder in the appeal process unless the subscriber asserted the defense of authorization and the arbitrator deemed disclosure necessary for the copyright holder to respond to the defense.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|50}} Bridy favorably compared the privacy of an appeal proceeding to the previous system of "mass John Doe litigation".&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|51}} The appeals process involved no hearings and no [[discovery (law)|discovery]], although the arbitrator could demand additional information from either party.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|54}}

The CCI said that subscribers may also challenge alerts or mitigation measures in court;&lt;ref name=alert-wrongly-sent/&gt; Bridy presumed that such a challenge could be made in the form of a request for [[declaratory judgment]] that the subscriber did not infringe.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|55}}
Mary LaFrance wrote that the system prevented any party from introducing a decision from the appeal process into any judicial proceeding.&lt;ref name=lafrance&gt;{{cite journal|last=LaFrance|first=Mary|title=Graduated Response by Industry Compact: Piercing the Black Box|journal=Cardozo Arts &amp; Entertainment Law Journal|year=2012|volume=30|pages=165–186|url=http://www.cardozoaelj.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/LaFrance.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|175}} According to the CCI, the failure of a subscriber to appeal a copyright alert under the Copyright Alert System "will not be construed as an admission or waiver in any other proceeding".&lt;ref name=independent-review-faqs&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Review FAQs|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/resources-faq/independent-review-faqs/|work=The Copyright Alert System|publisher=Center for Copyright Information|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridy wrote that the copyright law applied in independent reviews would be determined by an expert commissioned by the American Arbitration Association and approved by CCI, who was required to hear "prevailing legal principles" of copyright law as viewed by copyright owners.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|55}} Bridy suggested that the legal standards in an independent review would call into question the fairness of the independent review proceeding, citing what she said were inaccurate statements from the RIAA on copyright.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|56}} Bridy also said that the lack of written decisions in the independent review process would make it difficult to determine what the rules are for independent review or whether they are being followed.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|57}}

The EFF said that the mitigation measures could be imposed without any [[due process]], placing the burden of proof on consumers to show that allegations of copyright infringement are unfounded. The organization recommended that, in the absence of copyright infringement detection systems which have been demonstrated to be entirely accurate, the burden of proof be placed on the content providers to show copyright infringement prior to the mitigation measures. Bridy wrote that IP address collection and content identification methods should be held to a much higher standard (including review by an independent expert with no contractual obligations to the CCI nor non-disclosure obligations), especially since an alert itself could trigger a sanction.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|53}}

The EFF argued that the procedure for objecting to an alert was unfairly burdensome to the consumer and biased towards the media companies.&lt;ref name="EFFReaction" /&gt; Bridy said that because the Copyright Alert System arose from a mass consumer contract, the potential for the [[repeat-player effect]] to jeopardize the neutrality of the arbitrators was present.&lt;ref name=bridy/&gt;{{rp|55}} However, Bridy wrote that the independent review process was optional, and users were free to go to court to remove alerts or challenge mitigation measures, unlike in other consumer contracts where arbitration was mandatory. Although Bridy said that few subscribers would go to court owing to the possibility of a large damages award, this alternative allowed for full due process safeguards.&lt;ref name=bridy /&gt;{{rp|55}}

According to a May 2014 report by the Center for Copyright Information, from the implementation of the Copyright Alert System through the end of 2013, there were 265 appeals, representing 0.27% of the alerts triggering a mitigation measure for which the appeal process was available.&lt;ref name=copyright-alert-system-phase-one /&gt;{{rp|2}} Of the appeals, 47 (17.7%) were successful, the "vast majority" of which involved the "unauthorized use of account" defense.&lt;ref name=copyright-alert-system-phase-one&gt;{{cite web|title=The Copyright Alert System: Phase One and Beyond|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Phase-One-And_Beyond.pdf|accessdate=29 May 2014|author=Center for Copyright Information|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name=kravets&gt;{{cite web|last=Kravets|first=David|title=ISPs sent 1.3M copyright infringement notices to US customers last year|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/isps-sent-1-3m-copyright-infringement-notices-to-us-customers-last-year/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In none of the appeals was it determined that an account or copyrighted work was misidentified.&lt;ref name=copyright-alert-system-phase-one /&gt;{{rp|10}}

The negotiating parties completed a [[memorandum of understanding|Memorandum of Understanding]] in July 2011 and amended it in August 2011 and October 2012.&lt;ref name=MOU&gt;[http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Memorandum-of-Understanding.pdf Memorandum of Understanding]; [http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CCI-MOU-First-Amendment.pdf Aug. 2011 amendment]; [http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CCI-MOU-Second-Amendment.pdf Oct. 2012 amendment].&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement establishes the framework for the Copyright Alert System, establishing the roles and expectations of the ISPs, the copyright owners, and the monitoring services.

The Copyright Alert System launched in late February 2013.&lt;ref name="implementationrollout"/&gt;

The EFF cited a number of problems with the Memorandum of Understanding.&lt;ref name="EFFReaction"&gt;McSherry, Corynne and Goldman, Eric, [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/graduated-response-deal-what-if-users-had-been "The "Graduated Response" Deal: What if Users Had Been At the Table?"], Electronic Frontier Foundation, July 18, 2011. Retrieved November 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the EFF criticized the lack of subscriber representation in the CCI, noting that the establishment of the CCI involved only large media corporations and ISPs, but left out representatives of the subscribers who purchase these companies' products. Further, the CCI only allowed for a three-person advisory board from consumer interest groups, while the executive board is composed of six representatives from the media companies and ISPs, an arrangement which the EFF believed to be inadequate for consumer representation.

===Technology review===
The CCI contracted with [[Stroz Friedberg]], a global digital risk management and investigations firm, to conduct an analysis of MarkMonitor's system for monitoring, verifying, and enforcing online copyright infringement on P2P file sharing networks.&lt;ref name=Stroz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Independent-Expert-Assessment-Content-CCI-Redacted.pdf |title=Independent Expert Assessment of MarkMonitor AntiPiracy Methodologies [Redacted] |date=November 1, 2012 |accessdate=2013-03-03 |author=Stroz Friedberg, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stroz Friedberg assessed the efficacy of MarkMonitor's methodologies to monitor, identify, collect evidence, and generate notices to P2P infringers&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt; The contractor published the findings in a confidential report to the CCI in November 2012 (i.e., before the system launched), concluding that the methodologies were "well developed and robust", though not without room for improvement.&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt;

The publicly released version of the report contained a number of redactions of various details.&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt; Among the report's conclusions were the following claims:&lt;ref name=Stroz/&gt;
* "MarkMonitor's methodologies effectively identify P2P online copyright infringers".
* "MarkMonitor's evidence collection in connection with P2P infringement is robust, defensible, and will withstand adverse party scrutiny or evidentiary challenges".
* "The methodologies include appropriate checks and balances at key points in the workflow to ensure accuracy".

Although both the CCI and Stroz Friedberg claimed the review was independent, the CCI didn't release the Stroz Friedberg report until after media reports surfaced that Stroz Friedberg was an RIAA [[lobbying]] organization from 2004 to 2009.&lt;ref name="EFF201211"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ArsBio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/03/riaa-lobbyist-becomes-federal-judge-rules-on-file-sharing-cases/ |title=RIAA lobbyist becomes federal judge, rules on file-sharing cases |date=Mar 28, 2011 |last=Anderson | first=Nate |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm's sole lobbyist for the RIAA (and, briefly, [[Universal Music Group]])&lt;ref name=ArsBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=UMG_lobbying&gt;Stroz Frieberg lobbying data (public record) as published by OpenSecrets.org for [http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmlbs.php?id=F27199&amp;year=2005 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Beryl A.

In response to the "questions" raised, the CCI issued a statement reaffirming confidence in Stroz Friedberg's propriety and announcing the public release of the report, but also conceding, {{cquote|we are, however, sensitive to any appearance that Stroz lacks independence, and so CCI has decided to have another expert review Stroz's initial evaluation of the content community's processes.

The CCI also hired Stroz Friedberg to review the accuracy of the system by which ISPs match the IP addresses of suspected infringers to the ISPs' subscribers. The results of that review have not yet been publicly released.&lt;ref name=EFF201211/&gt;

In August 2013, the CCI announced it had hired [[Avi Rubin]]'s high-tech litigation consulting firm Harbor Labs to conduct a follow-up review.&lt;ref name=rubin&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/six-strikes-anti-piracy-system-gets-new-evidence-review-130817/ |title=Six Strikes Anti-Piracy System Gets New Evidence Review |date=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Harbor Labs completed a limited review of MarkMonitor's system, concluding that the technical design was generally sound, but that the company needs to improve its safeguards against human error and internal malfeasance.&lt;ref name="harbor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Harbor-Labs-Executive-Summary.pdf |title=Evaluation of the MarkMonitor AntiPiracy System |date=March 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the report was publicly disclosed when the CCI posted the report's executive summary eight months later. The report itself will not be released because it contains confidential information.&lt;ref name="harbor-tf"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-copyright-alert-system-security-could-be-improved-review-finds-141121/ | date=November 21, 2014 |title=US Copyright Alert System security could be improved, report finds |publisher=[[TorrentFreak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and controversy==
&lt;!--NOTE TO EDITORS: Opinions in reliable sources about specific aspects of the CAS should be placed in the appropriate section. --&gt;
The White House supported the Memorandum of Understanding, calling it "a positive step and consistent with our strategy of encouraging voluntary efforts to strengthen online intellectual property enforcement and with our broader Internet policy principles, emphasizing privacy, free speech, competition and due process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/07/07/working-together-stop-internet-piracy|publisher=White House|date=July 7, 2011|title=Working Together to Stop Internet Piracy|last=Espinel|first=Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the CAS was criticized for a perceived lack of public input, [[perverse incentive]]s between media corporations and ISPs, harsh mitigation measures, and reversal of [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] standards.&lt;ref name="TechDirt"&gt;Masnick, Mike, [http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110707/10173014998/major-us-isps-agree-to-five-strikes-plan-rather-than-three.shtml "Major US ISPs Agree To Five Strikes Plan, Rather Than Three"], Techdirt.com, July 7, 2011. Retrieved November 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The EFF made particularly detailed criticisms.&lt;ref name="EFFSameDay"&gt;Phillips, Abigail, [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/content-industry-and-isps-announce-common "The Content Industry and ISPs Announce a "Common Framework for Copyright Alerts": What Does it Mean for Users?"], Electronic Frontier Foundation, July 7, 2011. Retrieved November 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request related to the White House's role in the policy was denied by a Washington D.C. federal court.&lt;ref name="ars1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/federal-court-obama-admin-doesnt-need-to-release-more-six-strikes-documents/ | title=Federal court: Obama admin doesn't need to release more "six strikes" documents | publisher=Ars Technica | accessdate=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Soghoian, a policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), submitted the request to obtain information about the interaction in creating the policy.&lt;ref name=ars1 /&gt; It was denied in a summary judgement by Judge Royce C. Lamberth.&lt;ref name=ars1 /&gt; Lamberth's judgement rests on an exemption for drafts and "...reducing the possibility of misleading the public by disclosing documents that suggest certain reasons for a future decision that do not ultimately bear upon that decision".&lt;ref name=ars1 /&gt;

In 2012, the California ISP [[Sonic.net]] CEO told [[TorrentFreak]] that his ISP will not be participating in the Copyright Alert System, saying that ISPs are not equipped to police the actions of individuals, and that the [[MPAA]] and [[RIAA]] have not invited small, independent ISPs to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Has Your ISP Joined the US "Six Strikes" Anti-Piracy Scheme?|url=http://torrentfreak.com/isp-six-strikes-anti-piracy-scheme-120803/|accessdate=7 August 2012|newspaper=TorrentFreak|date=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly a representative of Cox Communications told TorrentFreak that they "have decided not to participate for internal reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ernesto|last=Van der Sar|title=MPAA / RIAA PONDER SUING PERSISTENT BITTORRENT PIRATES|url=http://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-riaa-ponder-suing-persistent-bittorrent-pirates-120618/|publisher=TorrentFreak|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the CAS' launch, concern existed that data collected for the CAS would be used for more than just the stated "educational" purposes. In the first draft of the CCI's Memorandum of Understanding, it was stated that upon that ISPs would be responsible for providing information collected under the CAS program to Content Owners "if it elects to initiate a legal action against the subscriber". The final agreed Memorandum of Understanding replaced the term "legal action" with "copyright infringement action". [footnote 12 – MOU Art 4 g iv.] Two months after the CAS's implementation, [[Verizon]] was subpoenaed to provide a third party plaintiff with information on its users which it recorded for CAS purposes. The plaintiff, Malibu Media argued that "DMCA notices and six strike alerts are relevant because these notices may prove a pattern of infringement and/or notice that infringement is occurring could be used to show a pattern of infringing behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malibu Media LLC v.

With this information, Malibu Media was able to successfully litigate the first BitTorrent copyright infringement case in American legal history which concluded with a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bellwether Trial (Malibu Media v.

===Open wireless networks===
Tech law professor Derek Bambauer of the [[University of Arizona]], told [[Ars Technica]] that the Copyright Alert System "is fundamentally flawed". Bambauer says that injustice could result in the case where a user legally downloaded an entire work under the doctrine of [[fair use]], but the CAS still treated the user as an infringer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weber|first=Peter|title=The anti-piracy Copyright Alert System: Is the Napster era finally dead?|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/240718/the-anti-piracy-copyright-alert-system-is-the-napster-era-finally-dead|publisher=The Week Publications|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFF said that the CAS will hinder the Open Wireless Movement's goals. Jill Lesser, Executive Director of the Center for Copyright Information, said that the CAS will affect small businesses that use a residential connection for open Wi-Fi: "Depending on the type of Internet service they subscribe to, very small businesses like a home-office or a local real estate office may have an Internet connection that is similar from a network perspective to a residential connection... The practical result is that if an employee of the small business, or someone using an open Wi-Fi connection at the business, engages in infringing activity the primary account owner would receive alerts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kamdar|first=Adi|title=Don't Be Fooled: "Six Strikes" Will Undoubtedly Harm Open Wireless|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/six-strikes-undoubtedly-harm-open-wireless|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects since implementation===
[[File:Copyright-alerts-chart.svg|thumb|300px|Distribution of the number of copyright alerts received by accounts during the first ten months of implementation of the Copyright Alert System.]]
According to Jill Lesser, the Executive Director of the CCI, the CAS's first year was successful as the CAS is "intended to be education based".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tummarello|first=Kate|title='Six strikes' thwarting piracy, leader says|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/199124-six-strikes-thwarting-piracy-leader-says|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lesser indicated that changes for 2014 might include expanding the program to more Internet service providers and also start including other forms of copyrighted media, such as software. In the first year of the CAS's existence, US traffic to The Pirate Bay increased by 31 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ernesto|title=SIX-STRIKES FAILS TO HALT U.S. PIRATE BAY GROWTH|url=http://torrentfreak.com/six-strikes-fails-to-halt-u-s-pirate-bay-growth-130903/|publisher=Torrent Freak|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 Warner Brothers Studios began sending warning to users whose internet service was provided by an entity other than one of the five ISP partners of the CCI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Jared|title=Warner Bros. fines file-sharers, even without six strikes|url=http://www.techhive.com/article/2041027/warner-bros-fines-file-sharers-even-without-six-strikes.html|publisher=TechHives|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Variety revealed that engineers at [[Comcast]] and [[NBC Universal]] were developing technology designed to recognize the illegal downloading of copyrighted material by its users and launch a pop-up window with links to legal access to such content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallenstein|first=Andrew|title=Comcast Developing Anti-Piracy Alternative to 'Six Strikes' (Exclusive)|url=https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/comcast-developing-anti-piracy-alternative-to-six-strikes-exclusive-1200572790/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a CCI-backed initiative, but rather was viewed as a potential supplement to the CAS as Comcast had begun approaching other content owners and ISPs to explore the concept with them. In the CAS's first year, [[Comcast]], the nation's largest ISP, sent out 625,000 warnings to its users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morran|first=Chris|title=COMCASTIC 3 Report: Comcast Sends Out Around 1,800 Copyright Alert Notices Each Day|url=http://consumerist.com/2014/02/07/report-comcast-sends-out-around-1800-copyright-alert-notices-each-day/|publisher=Consumerist|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Largely seen as another supplement to the CAS, in September 2013, AT&amp;T applied for a patent for technology that would allow the company to "prevent bandwidth abuse" by tracking the content its users are sharing via BitTorrent and other P2P networks in order to charge its users for excessive bandwidth use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morran|first=Chris|title=DISPATCH FROM THE DEATH STAR 1 AT&amp;T Patents System That Could Charge File-Sharers Extra For Data|url=http://consumerist.com/2014/01/31/att-patents-system-that-could-charge-file-sharers-extra-for-data/|publisher=Consumerisst|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''definition of music''' endeavors to give an accurate and concise explanation of music's basic attributes or essential nature and it involves a process of [[definition|defining]] what is meant by the term ''[[music]]''. Many authorities have suggested definitions, but defining music turns out to be more difficult than might first be imagined and there is ongoing debate. A number of explanations start with the notion of music as ''organized sound'' but they also highlight that this is perhaps too broad a definition and cite examples of organized sound that are not defined as music, such as [[human speech]], and sounds found in both [[Natural environment|natural]] and [[Industrial society|industrial]] environments {{harv|Kania|2014}}. The problem of defining music is further complicated by the influence of [[culture in music cognition]]. 

The ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'' defines music as "the art of combining vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion" {{harv|Concise Oxford Dictionary|1992}}. However, the music genres known as [[noise music]] and [[musique concrète]], for instance, challenge these ideas about what constitutes music's essential attributes by using sounds not widely considered as musical, like randomly produced electronic [[Distortion (music)|distortion]], [[Audio feedback|feedback]], [[Noise (radio)|static]], [[Phonaesthetics|cacophony]], and compositional processes using [[Indeterminacy (music)|indeterminacy]] ({{harvnb|Priest|2013|loc=132}}; {{harvnb|Hagerty|2007}}).

An oft cited notable example of the dilemma in defining music is a work entitled ''[[4'33'']]'' (1952) by the American composer [[John Cage]] (1912–1992). The written score has three movements and directs the performer(s) to appear on stage, indicate by gesture or other means when the piece begins, then make no sound and only mark sections and the end by gesture. What is heard are only whatever ambient sounds may occur in the room. Some argue this is not music because, for example, it contains no sounds that are conventionally considered "musical" and the composer and performer(s) exert no control over the organization of the sounds heard {{harv|Dodd|2013}}. Others argue it is music because the conventional definitions of musical sounds are unnecessarily and arbitrarily limited, and control over the organization of the sounds is achieved by the composer and performer(s) through their gestures that divide what is heard into specific sections and a comprehensible form {{harv|Gann|2010}}.


==Concepts of music==

Because of differing fundamental concepts of music, the languages of many cultures do not contain a word that can be accurately translated as "music," as that word is generally understood by Western cultures {{harv|Nettl|2005}}. [[Inuit]] and most [[North American Indian]] languages do not have a general term for music. Among the [[Aztecs]], the ancient [[Mexico|Mexican]] theory of rhetorics, poetry, dance, and instrumental music used the [[Nahuatl]] term ''In xochitl-in kwikatl'' to refer to a complex mix of music and other poetic verbal and non-verbal elements, and reserve the word ''Kwikakayotl'' (or cuicacayotl) only for the sung expressions {{harv|Leon-Portilla|2007|loc=11}}. In [[Africa]] there is no term for music in [[Tiv language|Tiv]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Efik language|Efik]], [[Berom language|Birom]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Idoma language|Idoma]], [[Eggon language|Eggon]] or [[Jarawa language (Nigeria)|Jarawa]]. Many other languages have terms which only partly cover what Western culture typically means by the term ''music'' ({{harvnb|Schafer|1996|loc=222-223}}). The [[Mapuche]] of [[Argentina]] do not have a word for ''music'', but they do have words for instrumental versus improvised forms (''kantun''), European and non-Mapuche music (''kantun winka''), ceremonial songs (''öl''), and ''tayil'' {{harv|Robertson–de Carbo|1976|loc=39}}.

While some languages in West Africa have no term for music, some West African languages accept the general concepts of music ({{harvnb|Nettl|1989|loc=48}}). ''Musiqi'' is the [[Persian language|Persian]] word for the science and art of music, ''muzik'' being the sound and performance of music ({{harvnb|Sakata|1983|loc=39}}), though some things European-influenced listeners would include, such as [[Quran]] chanting, are excluded.

==Music vs. noise==
[[Ben Watson (music writer)|Ben Watson]] points out that [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Große Fuge|Grosse Fuge]]'' (1825) "sounded like noise" to his audience at the time. Indeed, Beethoven's publishers persuaded him to remove it from its original setting as the last movement of a string quartet. He did so, replacing it with a sparkling ''Allegro''. They subsequently published it separately {{harv|Watson|n.d.|loc=109–10}}.{{Clarify|date=October 2015}}&lt;!--Is this meant to differentiate "music" from "noise", or to assert that the two things may not be indistinguishable?--&gt; Musicologist [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] considers the difference between noise and music nebulous, explaining that "The border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus&amp;nbsp;... By all accounts there is no ''single'' and ''intercultural'' universal concept defining what music might be" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=48, 55}}.

==Definitions==

===Organized sound===
{{See also|Musique concrete|Acousmatic music|Spectral music}} 
An often-cited definition of music is that it is "organized sound", a term originally coined by [[modernist]] composer [[Edgard Varèse]] {{harv|Goldman|1961|loc=133}} in reference to his own musical aesthetic. Varèse's concept of music as "organized sound" fits into his vision of "sound as living matter" and of "musical space as open rather than bounded" {{harv|Chou|1966a|loc=1&amp;ndash;4}}. He conceived the elements of his music in terms of "sound-masses", likening their organization to the natural phenomenon of [[crystallization]] {{harv|Chou|1966b|loc=157}}. Varèse thought that "to stubbornly conditioned ears, anything new in music has always been called [[Noise in music|noise]]", and he posed the question, "what is music but organized noises?" {{harv|Varèse and Chou|1966|loc=18}}.

The fifteenth edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' states that "while there are no sounds that can be described as inherently unmusical, musicians in each culture have tended to restrict the range of sounds they will admit." A human organizing element is often felt to be implicit in music (sounds produced by non-human agents, such as waterfalls or birds, are often described as "musical", but perhaps less often as "music"). The composer [[R. Murray Schafer|R. Murray]] {{harvtxt|Schafer|1996|loc=284}} states that the sound of classical music "has decays; it is granular; it has attacks; it fluctuates, swollen with impurities—and all this creates a musicality that comes before any 'cultural' musicality." However, in the view of semiologist [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]], "just as music is whatever people choose to recognize as such, noise is whatever is recognized as disturbing, unpleasant, or both" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=47&amp;ndash;48}}. (See "[[Definition of music#Social construct|music as social construct]]" below.)'''''

====Language====
{{Main|Musical language}}
Levi R. Bryant defines music not as a language, but as a marked-based, problem-solving method such as mathematics {{harv|Ashby|2004|loc=4}}.

===Musical universals===
{{main|Elements of music}}
Most definitions of music include a reference to sound and a list of universals of music can be generated by stating the elements (or aspects) of sound: [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[timbre]], [[loudness]], [[duration (music)|duration]], spatial location and [[Texture (music)|texture]] ({{harvnb| Burton |2015|loc=22–28}}). However, in terms more specifically relating to music: following [[Wittgenstein]], cognitive psychologist [[Eleanor Rosch]] proposes that categories are not clean cut but that something may be more or less a member of a category {{harv|Rosch|1973|loc=328}}. As such the search for musical universals would fail and would not provide one with a valid definition {{harv|Levitin|2006|loc=136–39}}. This is primarily because other cultures have different understandings in relation to the sounds that English language writers refer to as music.

===Social construct===
{{main|Ethnomusicology}}
Many people do, however, share a general idea of music. The Websters definition of music is a typical example: "the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity" (''Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', online edition).

===Subjective experience===
{{main|Aesthetics of music}}

This approach to the definition focuses not on the ''construction'' but on the ''experience'' of music. An extreme statement of the position has been articulated by the  Italian composer [[Luciano Berio]]: “Music is everything that one listens to with the intention of listening to music” {{harv|Berio, Dalmonte, and Varga|1985|loc=19}}. This approach permits the boundary between music and noise to change over time as the conventions of musical interpretation evolve within a culture, to be different in different cultures at any given moment, and to vary from person to person according to their experience and proclivities. It is further consistent with the subjective reality that even what would commonly be considered music is experienced as nonmusic if the mind is concentrating on other matters and thus not perceiving the sound's ''essence'' ''as music'' {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=9}}.

==Specific definitions==

===Clifton===
In his 1983 book, ''Music as Heard'', which sets out from the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] position of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty|Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Paul Ricoeur|Ricœur]], Thomas Clifton defines music as "an ordered arrangement of sounds and silences whose meaning is [[Presentationism|presentative]] rather than [[Denotation|denotative]]. . . . This definition distinguishes music, as an end in itself, from compositional technique, and from sounds as purely physical objects." More precisely, "music is the actualization of the possibility of any sound whatever to present to some human being a meaning which he experiences with his body—that is to say, with his mind, his feelings, his senses, his will, and his metabolism" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=1}}. It is therefore "a certain reciprocal relation established between a person, his behavior, and a sounding object" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=10}}.

Clifton accordingly differentiates music from non-music on the basis of the human behavior involved, rather than on either the nature of compositional technique or of sounds as purely physical objects. Consequently, the distinction becomes a question of what is meant by musical behavior: "a musically behaving person is one whose very being is absorbed in the significance of the sounds being experienced." However, "It is not altogether accurate to say that this person is listening ''to'' the sounds. First, the person is doing more than listening: he is perceiving, interpreting, judging, and feeling. Second, the preposition 'to' puts too much stress on the sounds as such. Thus, the musically behaving person experiences musical significance by means of, or through, the sounds" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=2}}.

In this framework, Clifton finds that there are two things that separate music from non-music: (1) musical meaning is presentative, and (2) music and non-music are distinguished in the idea of personal involvement. "It is the notion of personal involvement which lends significance to the word ''ordered'' in this definition of music" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=3–4}}. This is not to be understood, however, as a sanctification of extreme [[relativism]], since "it is precisely the 'subjective' aspect of experience which lured many writers earlier in this century down the path of sheer opinion-mongering. Later on this trend was reversed by a renewed interest in 'objective,' scientific, or otherwise non-introspective musical analysis. But we have good reason to believe that a musical experience is not a purely private thing, like [[seeing pink elephants]], and that reporting about such an experience need not be [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] in the sense of it being a mere matter of opinion" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=8–9}}.

Clifton's task, then, is to describe musical experience and the objects of this experience which, together, are called "phenomena," and the activity of describing phenomena is called "phenomenology" {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=9}}. It is important to stress that this definition of music says nothing about aesthetic standards. &lt;blockquote&gt;Music is not a fact or a thing in the world, but a meaning constituted by human beings. . . . To talk about such experience in a meaningful way demands several things. First, we have to be willing to let the composition speak to us, to let it reveal its own order and significance. . . . Second, we have to be willing to question our assumptions about the nature and role of musical materials. . . . Last, and perhaps most important, we have to be ready to admit that describing a meaningful experience is itself meaningful. {{harv|Clifton|1983|loc=5–6}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nattiez===
"Music, often an [[art]]/[[entertainment]], is a [[total social fact]] whose definitions vary according to [[era]] and [[culture]]," according to [[Jean Molino|Jean]] {{harvtxt|Molino|1975|loc=37}}. It is often contrasted with [[noise (environmental)|noise]]. According to musicologist [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]]: "The border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus.... By all accounts there is no ''single'' and ''intercultural'' universal concept defining what music might be" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=47&amp;ndash;8 and 55}}. Given the above demonstration that "there is no limit to the number or the genre of variables that might intervene in a definition of the musical," {{harv|Molino|1975|loc=42}} an organization of definitions and elements is necessary.

Nattiez (1990, 17) describes definitions according to a [[wikt:tripartite|tripartite]] semiological scheme similar to the following:
{|
|-
|colspan=3|Poietic Process
|colspan=2|Esthesic Process
|-
|Composer (Producer)
| →
|Sound (Trace)
| ←
|Listener (Receiver)
|}

There are three levels of description, the poietic, the neutral, and the esthesic:
*"&lt;!-- If musical semiology's sole contribution were replacing what everybody calls "composition" and "perception" with barbarou neologisms like 'poietic' and 'esthesic', then semiology would entail risibly small profits. There is, of course, more to it than that. --&gt; By 'poietic' I understand describing the ''link'' among the composer's intentions, his creative procedures, his mental schemas, and the ''result'' of this collection of strategies; that is, the components that go into the work's material embodiment. Poietic description thus also deals with a quite special form of hearing (Varese called it 'the interior ear'): what the composer hears while imagining the work's sonorous results, or while experimenting at the piano, or with tape."
*"By 'esthesic' I understand not merely the artificially attentive hearing of a musicologist, but the description of perceptive behaviors within a given population of listeners; that is how this or that aspect of sonorous reality is captured by their perceptive strategies" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=90}}.
*The neutral level is that of the physical "trace", (Saussere's sound-image, a sonority, a score), created and interpreted by the esthesic level (which corresponds to a perceptive definition; the perceptive and/or "social" construction definitions below) and the poietic level (which corresponds to a creative, as in compositional, definition; the organizational and social construction definitions below).

Table describing types of definitions of music {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=46}}:
{| class="wikitable"
!
!poietic level&lt;br/&gt;(choice of the composer)
!neutral level&lt;br/&gt;(physical definition)
!esthesic level&lt;br/&gt;(perceptive judgment)
|-
! music
| musical sound
| sound of the&lt;br/&gt;harmonic&lt;br/&gt;spectrum
| agreeable sound
|-
! non-music
| noise&lt;br/&gt;(nonmusical)
| noise&lt;br/&gt;(complex sound)
| disagreeable&lt;br/&gt;noise
|}

Because of this range of definitions, the study of music comes in a wide variety of forms. There is the study of sound and [[oscillation|vibration]] or [[acoustics]], the cognitive study of music, the study of [[music theory]] and performance practice or music theory and [[ethnomusicology]] and the study of the reception and history of music, generally called [[musicology]].

===Xenakis===
Composer [[Iannis Xenakis]] in "Towards a Metamusic" (chapter 7 of ''Formalized Music'') defined music in the following way {{harv|Xenakis|1971|loc=181}}:
#It is a sort of comportment necessary for whoever thinks it and makes it.
#It is an individual [[pleroma]], a realization.
#It is a fixing in sound of imagined virtualities (cosmological, philosophical, . . ., arguments)
#It is normative, that is, unconsciously it is a model for being or for doing by sympathetic drive.
#It is catalytic: its mere presence permits internal psychic or mental transformations in the same way as the crystal ball of the hypnotist.
#It is the gratuitous play of a child.
#It is a mystical (but atheistic) asceticism. Consequently, expressions of sadness, joy, love and dramatic situations are only very limited particular instances.

According to [[folklore]] a '''fairy path''' (or 'passage', 'avenue', or 'pass') is a route taken by fairies usually in a straight line and between sites of traditional significance, such as [[fairy fort]]s or [[Ringfort|raths]] (a class of circular earthwork dating from the [[Iron Age]]), "airy" (eerie) mountains and hills, thorn bushes, springs, lakes, rock outcrops, and Stone Age monuments. [[Ley line]]s and spirit paths, such as with [[corpse road]]s, have some similarities with these fairy paths.  A [[fairy ring]] is also a path used by fairies, but in a circle, for dancing, as described by poet [[W. B. Yeats]], "...the fairies dance in a place apart, Shaking their milk-white feet in a ring,..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Earth, Air, Fire, Water|last=Skelton| first=Robin|others= Margaret Blackwood| page= 181|publisher=Arkana, Penguin Group| year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is usually associated with [[Gaelic folklore (disambiguation)|Celtic folklore]], especially that of Ireland.

==Fairy paths and dwellings==
In some parts of Ireland, Brittany and Germany&lt;ref&gt;''Ley Lines: the Greatest Landscape Mystery'' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005
{{ISBN|0-9542963-4-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9542963-4-6}}; p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; there were fairy or spirit paths that while being invisible nevertheless had such perceived geographical reality in the minds of the country people that building practices were adapted to ensure they were not obstructed. A significant number of the characteristics of fairy paths are shared in common with [[ley line]]s. In many parts of Northern Europe the [[tumulus|round barrow]]s were the traditional homes of the [[fairies]], [[elves]], or [[trolls]] and were avoided by the country folk. Such places were Fairy Toot in [[Somerset]], Elf Howe barrow near [[Folkton]], Yorkshire, and a round barrow at [[Beedon]] in Berkshire. [[Cornwall]] was and is a stronghold of fairy lore: fairies are said to dance on [[Ballowall Barrow|Carn Gluze]], near [[St Just in Penwith]].&lt;ref name ="Bord72"&gt;Bord, Janet &amp; Colin (1973) ''Mysterious Britain''. Garnstone Press. {{ISBN|0-85511-180-1}}; p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In Danish [[Jutland]] there was a belief that "Barrow-folk" dwelt in barrows and were descendants of [[fallen angel]]s cast out of [[Heaven]].&lt;ref name=northmyth&gt;''Northern Mythology, Comprising the Principal Popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and the Netherlands'', Benjamin Thorpe &amp; E. Lumley, 1851; pp. 115–124&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, it was considered bad luck to let cattle graze on any place where the Elf-folk have been, or to let the cattle mingle with the large blue cattle of the elves. However, all evils may be averted if one were to ask at an "Elf-barrow" for permission to graze cattle on their mound.&lt;ref name=northmyth/&gt; Some Danish "Elf-barrows" included one near Galtebjerg, another not far from [[Kalundborg]]; one between [[Thisted]] and [[Aalborg]] that was said to be the home of an elfin [[Smithing|smith]]; two near [[Sundby, Copenhagen|Sundby]] where a troll-smith would ride from one to the other followed by his apprentices and journeymen; and one at Tröstrup where according to legend a giant was buried, and it was said his daughter wandered across the fields and one day met a ploughman whom she took back to her father who then set the man free, fearing that they'd be driven out of their barrow.&lt;ref name=northmyth/&gt; In [[Sweden]] similar beliefs existed and one barrow called ''Helvetesbacke'' (''"Hell's mouth"'') that lies near Kråktorps gård, [[Småland]], was claimed to be the burial mound of [[Odin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Northern Mythology, Comprising the Principal Popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and the Netherlands'', Benjamin Thorpe &amp; E. Lumley, 1851; p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany the [[Wild Hunt|Wild Troop of Rodenstein]] was said to ride a straight path between the castles of Rodenstein and Schnellert. Also throughout Europe are [[Corpse roads]], which are generally believed to be of the same basic belief as ''fairy paths'' and most likely share an origin.&lt;ref&gt;'Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005

==Consequences of blocking fairy paths==
[[File:Fairy Ring 0004.JPG|thumb|right|180px|&lt;center&gt;A [[Fairy Ring]] of mushrooms&lt;center&gt;]]
In Ireland, people who had illnesses or other misfortune, were said to live in houses that were "in the way" or in a "contrary place", obstructing a fairy path. An example is that of a family in which four children sickened and died, leaving the doctors baffled. The fifth child sickened and was near death, only to make a sudden and full recovery. The father told the doctor that he had consulted a wise woman who informed him that his new house extension blocked a fairy path between two fairy forts, whereupon he demolished it and his child became healthy again.&lt;ref name="Bord27"&gt;Bord, Janet and Colin (1976).

An example of this fairy path straightness is provided by an account concerning a croft (now a cattle shed) at Knockeencreen, [[Brosna, County Kerry]]. In an interview in the 1980s, the last human occupant told of the troubles his grandfather had experienced there, with his cattle periodically and inexplicably dying. The front door is exactly opposite the back door. The grandfather was informed by a passing Gypsy that the dwelling stands on a fairy path running between two hills. The Gypsy advised the grandfather to keep the doors slightly ajar at night to allow the fairies free passage. The advice was heeded and the problem ceased. It so happens that the building is indeed on a straight line drawn between two local hilltops, and is, moreover, at one end of a long, straight track.&lt;ref name="Fortean"&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/491/where_the_leylines_led.html Where the Leylines led] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913113534/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/491/where_the_leylines_led.html |date=13 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wentz38"&gt;Wentz, W.

The fairies processed from Rath Ringlestown in Ireland every night and parents brought their children in before the fairies were due to pass. The path passed round several bushes which were left undisturbed by the locals. A man who cut down one bush could not get it to burn and sickened and died within a short while as a supposed consequence of his actions. The route also passed between two mud-wall houses and a man who was out at the wrong time was found dead; the fairies having taken him for getting in the way of the procession.&lt;ref name="Wentz38"/&gt;
A traditional folk tale from the Southern Shore of Newfoundland, Canada, concerns a young married couple who discovered that they had built their house on a path used by the good people, and the steps that couple take to rid themselves of fairy mischief. It seems therefore that the fairy folk had emigrated together with their human counterparts or had been in Canada from time immemorial.&lt;ref name="Newfoundland"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/DaleJarvisTheHouseOnTheFairyPath.  Newfoundland Fairy Path.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Home-owners have knocked corners from houses because the corner blocked the fairy path,&lt;ref name="Silver-hiding"&gt;Silver, Carole G. (1999) Strange and Secret Peoples: Fairies and Victorian Consciousness. Oxford University Press. p.47 {{ISBN|0-19-512199-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cottages have been built with the front and back doors in line, so that the owners could, in need, leave them both open and let the fairies troop through all night.&lt;ref&gt;Lenihan, Eddie and Green, Carolyn Eve (2004) ''Meeting The Other Crowd:  The Fairy Stories of Hidden Ireland''. pp.146–7 {{ISBN|1-58542-206-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was believed that a house built on a fairy path would suffer from midnight noises or supernatural manifestations. Ill-luck in the form of sick farm animals or personal illness could be the result and one remedy was to build small fires in several places along the fairy path, using fire from the blessed fire of [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist|Saint John]]'s Eve that was lit every year at sunset on 23 June.&lt;ref name="Bord"&gt;Bord, Janet and Colin (1976). ''The Secret Country''. Pub. Paul Elek, London. {{ISBN|0-236-40048-7}}. pp. 26 – 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detecting fairy paths and overcoming their influence==
[[File:Fairychapeltoun.JPG|Thumb|right|150px]]
Some builders used to use a technique to see if the planned construction was going to be on a fairy path; they would map out the floor plan in the earth and place a pile of stones at each corner and leave it overnight, if the stones were undisturbed it was safe to build, otherwise the work would not continue. There is another theme that states if one's house is on a fairy path, one must leave the doors and windows open at night, front and back, to allow fairies to pass through. Builders were also advised against using white quartz in their stonework, as it is said to be a fairy stone.&lt;ref name="Maljonic"&gt;[http://www.maljonicsdreams.com/Dream_Spells/fairy_paths.htm Maljonic's Fairy Paths]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wise-women were thought to be able to advise home builders of the existence of fairy paths, however in most folk-tales they are only consulted after the event and as a result of disturbances, bad luck, etc.

A building placed on a fairy path would be demolished by the fairy folk, at least twice, often remaining standing however on the third attempt.&lt;ref name="Wentz67"&gt;Wentz, W. Y. (1911). ''The Fairy-faith in Celtic Countries.'' Reprinted. Colin Smythe (1981). {{ISBN|0-901072-51-6}}. P. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walking along fairy paths==
Paths that the fairies travel along are usually stated as being best avoided, however they also had certain benefits to humans, such as with [[Trod|'trods']] in the West of England. These are a straight-line fairy path in the grass of a field with a different shade of green to the rest. People with rheumatism sought relief by walking along these tracks, though animals avoid them. Great danger was still very much associated with using these paths at times when a supernatural procession might be using them. [[Fairy ring]]s have certain elements in common with this phenomenon and were seen as 'gateways' into the realm of supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="Pennick1996132"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1996). ''Celtic Sacred Landscapes''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-01666-6}}. P. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tylwyth teg]] of Wales have paths on which it is death for a mortal to walk.&lt;ref name="Wentz150"&gt;Wentz, W. Y. (1911). ''The Fairy-faith in Celtic Countries.'' Reprinted. Colin Smythe (1981). {{ISBN|0-901072-51-6}}. P. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Breton people|Breton]] [[Ankou]], who is king of the dead, and his subjects have their own particular paths along which they process.&lt;ref name="Wentz218"&gt;Wentz, W. Y. (1911).

== Underwater fairy paths ==
Irish fairy paths are said to also exist under water, reminiscent of causeways in marshes at sacred sites and those to [[crannog]]s and other islands. These paths, only used by the fairy folk, ran from one island to another and were paved with coral, making them and their travellers visible to fishermen in their boats above.&lt;ref name="Pennick199613"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1996).

The '''Federal Writers' Project''' ('''FWP''') was a United States federal government project created to provide jobs for out-of-work writers during the [[Great Depression]]. It was part of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), a [[New Deal]] program. It was one of a group of New Deal arts programs known collectively as [[Federal Project Number One]].

==Background==
[[File:Moments-with-Genius-Poster.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Poster for the Illinois Writers Project radio series ''Moments with Genius'', presented by the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] (c. 1939)]]
Funded under the [[Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935]], the Federal Writers' Project was established July 27, 1935, by President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]].  [[Henry Alsberg]], a journalist, playwright, theatrical producer, and human rights activist, directed the program from 1935-1939. In 1939 Alsberg was fired, federal funding was cut, and the Project fell under state sponsorship, led by John D. Newsom, until the FWP ended completely in 1943.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Henry Alsberg: The Driving Force of the New Deal's Federal Writer's Project.|last=Rubenstein DeMasi|first=Susan|publisher=McFarland and Co.|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4766-2601-7|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FWP produced thousands of publications over its existence including state guides, city guides, local histories, oral histories, ethnographies, children's books, and other works. In addition to writers, the Project provided jobs to unemployed librarians, clerks, researchers, editors, historians, and others. It's been estimated that over ten-thousand people found employment in the FWP.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The Federal Writers' Project set out not only to provide work relief for unemployed writers, but to create a unique "self-portrait of America" through publication of guidebooks.

== American Guide Series and other publications ==
''[[American Guide Series|The American Guide series]],'' the most well-known of the FWP's publications, consisted of guides to the then 48 states, as well as [[Alaska Territory|the Alaska Territory]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] The books were written and compiled by writers from individual states and territories, and edited by Alsberg and his staff in Washington, D.C. The format was generally uniform, and each guide included detailed histories of the state or territory, with descriptions of every city and town, automobile travel routes, photographs, maps, and chapters on natural resources, culture,  and geography. The inclusion of essays about the various cultures of people living in the states, including immigrants and African Americans, was unprecedented. City books, such as ''The New York City Guide'', were also published as part of the series. Some full-length books are available online at the [https://archive.org/search.php?query=WPA%20Federal%20Writers%27%20Project Internet Archive].  The FWP also published another series, ''Life In America'', as well as numerous individual titles.  Many FWP books were bestsellers. Others, like ''Cape Cod Pilot'', written by author Josef Berger using the pseudonym Jeremiah Digges, received critical acclaim.

In each state a Writers' Project non-relief staff of editors was formed, along with a much larger group of field workers drawn from local unemployment rolls. The people hired came from a variety of backgrounds, ranging from former newspaper workers to white-collar and blue-collar workers without writing or editing experience.

[[Image:George Dillard 85 former slave.jpg|right|thumb|260px|George Dillard's oral history was recorded for the [[Slave Narrative Collection]] by the Federal Writers' Project (1936)]]

== Ancillary projects ==
Notable projects of the Federal Writers' Project included the [[Slave Narrative Collection]], a set of interviews that culminated in over 2,300 first-person accounts of slavery and 500 black-and-white photographs of former slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/snhtml/ Born in Slavery: Slave Narratives from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936-1938]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these narratives are available online from the above-named collection at the Library of Congress website. Folklorist [[Benjamin A. Botkin]] was instrumental in insuring the survival of these manuscripts. Among the researchers and authors who have used this collection are [https://www.colsonwhitehead.com Colson Whitehead] for his Pulitzer-Prize winning novel, ''The Underground Railroad''.

Other programs that emerged from Alsberg's desire to create an inclusive "self-portrait of America" were the Life History and Folklore Projects. These consisted of first-person narratives and interviews (collected and conducted by FWP workers) which represented people of various ethnicites, regions and occupations. According to the Library Congress website, [https://www.loc.gov/collections/federal-writers-project/about-this-collection/ American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936 to 1940], the documents "chronicle vivid life stories of Americans who lived at the turn of the century and include tales of meeting Billy the Kid, surviving the 1871 Chicago fire, pioneer journeys out West, grueling factory work, and the immigrant experience. Writers hired by this Depression-era work project included Ralph Ellison, Nelson Algren, May Swenson, and many others."

The Illinois Writers' Project, represented one of the few racially integrated Project sites. The [[Chicago]] project employed [[Arna Bontemps]], an established voice of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], and helped to launch the literary careers of African American writers such as [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Margaret Walker]], [[Katherine Dunham]], and [[Frank Yerby]] (Mangione 1972). The Virginia Negro Studies Project employed 16 African American writers and culminated in the publication of ''The Negro in Virginia (1940).'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/guides/opac/wpalhabout.htm|title=Library of Virginia, About the WPA Life Histories Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, it included photographs by Robert McNeill, now remembered as a groundbreaking African American photographer. The unpublished works of African American writer Zora Neale Hurston, who was employed by the Florida Writers' Project, was compiled years after her death in ''Go Gator and Muddy the Water: Writings by Zora Neale Hurston from the Federal Writers' Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Go Gator and Muddy the Water: Writings by Zora Neale Hurston from the Federal Writers' Project|last=Bordelon|first=Pamela|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=1999|isbn=978-0-393-31813-5|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
For most of its lifetime, the Federal Writers' Project faced a barrage of criticism from conservatives. When ''Massachusetts: A Guide to Its Places and People'', was published, it was lauded by government officials, including Governor Charles Hurley. But the day after its publication, "conservatives attacked the book over its essays on the [[1912 Lawrence textile strike]] and other labor issues. Even more sacrilegious to these critics was the coverage of the [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] affair."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Scholars called the questionable passages "fair accounts;"  ironically, the controversy helped increase book sales.

The most poisonous attacks against the FWP came from the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (commonly known as HUAC) and its chair, the media-savvy Congressman [[Martin Dies Jr.]] of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mangione|first=Jerre|title=The Dream and the Deal: the Federal Writers’ Project, 1935-1943|year=1996|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse|isbn=9780815604150|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alsberg and [[Hallie Flanagan]], his counterpart at the [[Federal Theatre Project]], faced tremendous scrutiny from the committee. The Dies HUAC committee, like the McCarthy committee of the 1950s, "used inquisitorial scare tactics, innuendo, and unsupported accusations."  Alsberg, Flanagan and others who were accused of supporting the communist agenda could not  "examine evidence against them, could not produce their own witnesses, could not cross-examine accusers."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Accusations that communist activities were carried out openly, and that Soviets funded labor unions which then took control of the arts' projects, were found to be false. Future Guggenheim scholar and author Richard Wright was often under attack, with his writings pronounced as "vile." (Rubenstein, p.&amp;nbsp;202.) Among the many charges leveled against the FWP and its members, was that Richard Wright was not born in the United States. (He was born in Mississippi.) Alsberg wrote a long court brief and provided supporting documents to refute each charge.

]]

Support for the FWP came from Eleanor Roosevelt, as well as mainstream publishing companies such as Viking Press, Random House, and Alfred Knopf, which produced some of the books. Americans continued to purchase ''American Guide'' books throughout this period. By 1939, HUAC's tactics seemed to work, and the newly elected Congress cut $150,000 million from WPA budget while quadrupling HUAC's funding. In January 1939, 6,000 people were laid off from Federal One. By July 1939, Congress voted to eliminate the Theatre Project. Federal sponsorship for the Federal Writers' Project came to an end in 1939, although the program was permitted to continue under state sponsorship, with some federal employees, until 1943. In the last months of the FWP's existence, Henry Alsberg was fired. He continued to work past his firing date in order to meet contractual arrangements with the publishers of three upcoming ''American Guide'' books. By the time of his departure in 1939, the FWP had published 321 publications; hundreds more remained in various stages of publications. Some were published in the years leading up to 1943 under the renamed Writer's Program. Others were never completed. Over the lifetime of the FWP and the Writer's Program, it is estimated that 10,000 people were employed. (Rubenstein, p.&amp;nbsp;221.)

==Film==
A [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]-funded documentary about the Federal Writers' Project, entitled ''Soul of a People: Writing America's Story'' premiered on the [[Smithsonian Channel]] in September 2009. The film includes interviews with notable American authors Studs Terkel, [[Stetson Kennedy]], and popular American historian [[Douglas Brinkley]]. The companion book was published by Wiley &amp; Sons as ''Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America''.

The Slave Narratives are represented by the HBO documentary, ''[[Unchained Memories|Unchained Memories: Readings from the Slave Narratives]]''. This program features well-known actors such as Angela Bassett and Samuel L. Jackson performing dramatic readings of the transcripts.

The 1999 film ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'', by Tim Robbins, while depicting the events of the Federal Theatre Project (FTP), dramatizes the attacks against Federal One (via the House Committee on Un-American Activities) which helped shutter both the FTP and the FWP.

'''Gustav Ludwig Heinrich Mützel''' (December 7, 1839 &amp;ndash; October 29, 1893) was a [[Germany|German]] artist, famous for his mammal and bird paintings, including the illustrations for the second edition of [[Alfred Edmund Brehm]]'s [[Brehms Tierleben|''Thierleben'']] and [[Richard Lydekker]]'s [https://archive.org/details/royalnaturalhist01lyderich ''The Royal Natural History''].

Gustav Mützel was the son of the painter Heinrich Mützel and his wife Luise Pauline Friedrichs. He attended the French high school in his hometown. Subsequently Mützel began to study at the Academy of Art at age 18 and was, amongst others, a pupil of the painter [[Eduard Daege]].

On 1 November 1865 Mützel married Anna Schönherr in Berlin and raised three children; Hans, Walter and Gertrud. Mützel and his wife settled in Königsberg in the Neumark, where he was active as photographer. To keep up with the latest technical developments in photography Mützel and his family moved to Berlin in 1870.

After the [[Franco-German War]] Mützel started illustrating some of the more important encyclopedias of the time. He created a large number of  illustrations for the German Ornithological Society, having been a member since 1874. Mützel's diverse interests led also to his membership of the German Society for Anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory and the Association of Berlin artists. The Nießen'sche Choral Society awarded him with an honorary membership.

Gustav Mützel died at his home (Hagelsberger Str. 10) at the age of 54 years on 29 October 1893 of heart and kidney ailments. He was interred at the cemetery in Mariendorf on 1 November.

The '''Jack Benny Center for the Arts''', located in Bowen Park, [[Waukegan, Illinois]], is the Cultural Arts Division of the [http://www.waukeganparks.org Waukegan Park District]. The Center plays host to the Bowen Park Theatre and Opera Company (a professional theatre/opera company), the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra and Concert Chorus (community based performance groups), as well as numerous theatre, dance, and /visual art classes and private music and voice lessons.  The center started out as a not-for-profit corporation in 1964.  Upon the death of [[Jack Benny]] in 1974, the name was changed.  The music and fine arts school became part of the Waukegan Park District in 1982 as a division of the recreation department.

==History==
The Waukegan Park District completed a new home for the center and its departments in Bowen Park in 1987 and had become its own division of the park district. Originally the Center had been in Bowen Park, moved to Powell Park for a time, and was delighted to return to Bowen Park. With the addition of Goodfellow Hall, an eighty-nine-seat lecture-recital hall, the division founded Bowen Park Theatre and Bowen Park Opera in the mid 1980s. These two companies went from semi-professional to fully professional, non-Equity, non-union in three years.

Waukegan Symphony Orchestra was born on April 24, 1974, when favorite comedic son Jack Benny returned to his home town of Waukegan to star in the WSO's initial performance. It was a magical night, held at Waukegan High School's auditorium. Like the Music Center of Lake County, the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra has made itself synonymous with the broad range of culture that is the hallmark of the city.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Through its thirty-five-plus-year history, the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra has engaged its audiences in both traditional and challenging works.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Musical direction now rests in the  hands of Maestro Stephen Blackwelder.

Waukegan Concert Chorus was established as a community chorus in 1976 to sing with the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Verdi's ''Requiem''. Both the members of the community{{Who|date=April 2011}} recognized the great benefit of retaining such a cultural asset in the community and the Chorus continued as an independent sister organization to the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra.

Lynn Schornick and Ken Smouse founded Bowen Park Theatre Company in the spring of 1987 at approximately the same time as Bowen Park Opera. The company's objective was to produce mostly classical drama and comedies, avoiding musicals and the repertory of neighboring theatre groups. Within three years, Bowen Park Theatre became a fully professional, non-equity theatre, joining the professional ranks of only two other companies in Lake County. Currently, the Ensemble Players (college age), the Roundtree Players (14–18 years of age) and Stage One (8–13 years of age) give the youth to young adults of the community an opportunity to develop and study the art of acting, also use the Dr. Lynn Schornick Theatre in Goodfellow Hall.

Bowen Park Opera Company has its roots to the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra performances in the mid-1980s.  In 1987, the new Jack Benny Center for the Arts facility was completed in Bowen Park.  Lynn Schornick and Ken Smouse founded Bowen Park Opera Company to perform in Goodfellow Hall. Its first production was a double bill in the spring of 1987 of Holst's ''The Wandering Scholar'' and Mozart's ''The Impresario''.   In 2003, Goodfellow Hall was renamed the Dr. Lynn Schornick Theatre in Goodfellow Hall to honor the man who had led the Cultural Arts to where it is today.  Dr.  Schornick retired from the Waukegan Park District in 2004.

In 1994, the Cultural Arts Division became responsible for the programs of the Waukegan Park District's Historic Districts. The operation and restoration of the Haines Museum in Bowen Park was only a part of that. Programs were developed and the newest of the Cultural Arts' departments, Bowen Heritage Circle, was born. The Bowen Heritage Circle specializes in traditional and special interest crafts and lectures.  The [[Waukegan Historical Society]] rents the Haines House and library space at Lilac Cottage.  The society maintains the collections and the park district provides the organization with a museum supervisor.

Goodfellow Hall was a part of the [[Jane Addams|Jane Addams']] [[Hull House]] Settlement House's Bowen Country Club.

'''John Harold Hewitt''' (28 October 1907 – 22 June 1987), who was born in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], was the most significant Belfast [[poet]] to emerge before the 1960s generation of [[Irish poetry|Northern Irish poets]] that included [[Seamus Heaney]], [[Derek Mahon]] and [[Michael Longley]]. He was appointed the first writer-in-residence at [[Queen's University Belfast]] in 1976. His collections include ''The Day of the Corncrake'' (1969) and ''Out of My Time: Poems 1969 to 1974'' (1974). He was also made a Freeman of the City of Belfast in 1983, and was awarded [[honorary doctorate]]s the [[University of Ulster]] and Queen's University Belfast.&lt;ref name="Collection"&gt;[http://library.ulster.ac.uk/craine/hewitt/life.htm John Hewitt (1907–1987)], John Hewitt Collection, University of Ulster, accessed 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

From November 1930 to 1957, Hewitt held positions in the [[Belfast Museum &amp; Art Gallery]]. His radical socialist ideals proved unacceptable to the Belfast Unionist establishment and he was passed over for promotion in 1953. Instead in 1957 he moved to [[Coventry]], a city still rebuilding following [[Coventry Blitz|its devastation]] during [[World War II]] . Hewitt was appointed Director of the [[Herbert Art Gallery &amp; Museum]] where he worked until retirement in 1972.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Hewitt had an active political life, describing himself as "a man of the left", and was involved in the [[British Labour Party]], the [[Fabian Society]] and the Belfast Peace League.&lt;ref name="Left"&gt;[http://library.ulster.ac.uk/craine/hewitt/life.htm#left John Hewitt: Man of the Left], John Hewitt Collection, University of Ulster, accessed 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was attracted to the [[Ulster]] dissenting tradition and was drawn to a concept of regional identity within the island of Ireland, describing his identity as Ulster, Irish, British and European.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;[http://www.johnhewitt.org/biography.php Biography: John Harold Hewitt (1907–1987)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070731110108/http://www.johnhewitt.org/biography.php |date=31 July 2007 }}, John Hewitt International Summer School, accessed 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; John Hewitt officially opened the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre (BURC) Offices on [[May Day|Mayday]] 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avecsolutions.net/book/TheJohnHewitt41-44.pdf Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074401/http://www.avecsolutions.net/book/TheJohnHewitt41-44.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }}, ''Making Good Money in Belfast: Social Economy Businesses'', p. 44, accessed 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Words on the Cushendun Stone - geograph.org.uk - 247602.jpg|thumb|Words by John Hewitt on the Cushendun Stone.]]
His life and work are celebrated in two prominent ways – the annual John Hewitt International Summer School – and, less conventionally, a Belfast pub is named after him – the John Hewitt Bar and Restaurant, which is situated on the city's Donegall Street and which opened in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avecsolutions.net/book/TheJohnHewitt41-44.pdf The John Hewitt: More than just a great pub] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074401/http://www.avecsolutions.net/book/TheJohnHewitt41-44.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }}, ''Making Good Money in Belfast: Social Economy Businesses'', pp. 41–44, accessed 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] was named after him as he officially opened the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre, which owns the establishment. It is a popular meeting place for local writers, musicians, journalists, students and artists. Both the [[Belfast Festival at Queen's]] and the [[Belfast Film Festival]] use the venue to stage events.

==Hewitt's life and writing==
{{more citations needed|date=March 2009}}

===Early life===
After attending Agnes Street National School, Hewitt attended the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]] from 1919 to 1920 &lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; before moving to [[Methodist College Belfast]], where he was a keen cricketer.  In 1924, he started an English degree at the [[Queen's University of Belfast]], obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1930,&lt;ref name="PRONI"&gt;[http://www.proni.gov.uk/records/private/hewitt.htm The John Hewitt Papers (D/3838)], [[Public Record Office of Northern Ireland]], accessed 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which he followed by obtaining a teaching qualification from [[Stranmillis College]], Belfast.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; During these years, his calling to radical and socialist causes deepened; he heard [[James Larkin]] address a Labour rally, began to write for a range of Trades Union and Socialist publications, and co-founded a journal entitled ''Iskra''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Hewitt also attended the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] Annual Conference as a Belfast City delegate in 1929 and 1930. He resisted the advocacy of a workers’ republic in the party's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/h/Hewitt_J/life.htm |title =John Hewitt: Life, &amp;c. |accessdate =2008-01-05 |publisher =Ricorso }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Hewitt was appointed Art Assistant at the [[Ulster Museum|Belfast Museum and Art Gallery]], where amongst other duties, he gave public lectures on art, at one of which he met Roberta "Ruby" Black, whom he was to marry in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niliteraryarchive.com/content/%E2%80%8Bjohn-harold-hewitt|title=John Hewitt|last=admin|first=|date=2016-06-14|website=www.niliteraryarchive.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberta was also a convinced Socialist, and the couple became members of the [[Independent Labour Party]], the Belfast Peace League, the [[Left Book Club]]&lt;ref name="Left"/&gt; and the [[Liberty (pressure group)|British Civil Liberties Union]].

===Early writing===
Hewitt began experimenting with poetry while still a schoolboy at Methodist College in the 1920s. Typically thorough, his notebooks from these years are filled with hundreds of poems, in dozens of styles; Hewitt's main influences at this time included [[William Blake]], [[William Morris]] and [[W. B. Yeats]], and for the most part the verse is either highly [[Romanticism|romantic]], or strongly [[Socialism|socialist]], a theme which increased in prominence as the 1930s began. Morris is the key figure, combining both these strains, and allowing Hewitt to articulate the radical, [[Dissenter|dissenting]] strain which he inherited from his [[Methodist]] forbearers, including his father.

As the 1920s moved into the 1930s, Hewitt's writing began to develop and mature. Firstly, his role models (including [[Vachel Lindsay]]) became more modern; secondly, he discovered in Chinese poetry a voice which was "quiet and undemonstrative but clear and direct",&lt;ref&gt;from his unpublished autobiography, ''A North Light''&lt;/ref&gt; and which answered a part of Hewitt's temperament which had been suppressed. Finally, and most importantly, he began his lifelong work of excavation and discovery of the poetry of Ulster, starting with [[Richard Rowley]], [[Joseph Campbell (poet)|Joseph Campbell]] and [[George William Russell]] (AE). This research culminated, in part, with the publications of ''Fibres, Fabric and Cordage'' in 1948, ''Rhyming Weavers and other Country Poets of Antrim and Down'' (based on his MA thesis, ''Ulster Poets 1800–1870'' of 1951) in 1974, and a book called ''The Rhyming Weavers'' in 1979. All of these publications and more, were based on his interest in the [[Weaver Poets|Ulster rhyming weaver poets]] of the 19th century, such as [[Henry MacDonald Flecher]], [[David Herbison]], [[Alexander MacKenzie (poet)|Alexander MacKenzie]], [[James MacKowen]], and [[James Orr (poet)|James Orr]].

Hewitt himself felt that his [[juvenilia]] ended with the poem ''Ireland'' (1932), which he placed at the start of his ''Collected Poems'' (1968), and indeed it is more complex than most of his earlier work, and begins his lifelong preoccupation with bleak landscapes of bog and rock; with exile, and with the nature of belonging.

===The 1930s===
The 1930s was a period of transition in Hewitt's poetry, one in which he began seriously to address the tortured history of his native province, and the contradictions between his love for the people and the landscape, his inspiration in the radical dissenting tradition, and the bloody, fratricidal conflicts which scar Northern Ireland to this day. A key text is ''The Bloody Brae: A Dramatic Poem'' (finished in 1936, though not broadcast – on the Northern Ireland Home Service of the [[BBC]] – until 1954; the Belfast Lyric Players performed a stage version in 1957, which they revived in 1986), which tells of a legendary massacre of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] troops in [[Islandmagee]], County Antrim, in 1642. John Hill, one of the soldiers who has been racked by guilt since he participated in the slaughter, returns many years later to beg forgiveness. This he receives from the ghost of one of his victims, a gesture which she wraps in a condemnation of his self-indulgence, luxuriating in his guilt rather than taking positive action to combat bigotry. Another theme which was to become a fixture in Hewitt's poetry also first appears in ''The Bloody Brae''; that is, a bold assertion of the right of his people  to live in Ulster, rooted in their hard work and commitment to it:
:This is my country; my grandfather came here
:and raised his walls and fenced the tangled waste
:and gave his years and strength into the earth
Hewitt is not claiming a right of Imperial possession here; rather, the right to live alongside the native population.

Also in the 1930s, Hewitt was involved in with a group of young artists and sculptors known as the 'Ulster Unit', and acted as their secretary.&lt;ref name="Collection"/&gt;

===1940s and 1950s===

During the 1940s and 1950s, Hewitt increasingly played the role of reviewer and art critic. He gained an [[Master of Arts|MA]] from [[Queen's University Belfast]], with a thesis on Ulster poets from 1800–1870, in 1951.&lt;ref name="Collection"/&gt; In 1951 he had been appointed deputy director and keeper of art at the [[Belfast Museum and Art Gallery]] but in 1957, Hewitt left to take up the position of Art Director at the [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]] in [[Coventry]], a position he held until 1972.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Frank Ormsby, ‘Hewitt, John Harold (1907–1987)’, rev. [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; While in [[Coventry]], Hewitt started work on his unpublished autobiography, ''A North Light''. He subsequently returned to [[Belfast]] on his retirement in 1972.&lt;ref name="Collection"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The John Hewitt Society was established in 1987 to commemorate his life and work. Its mission is "to promote literature, arts, and culture inspired by the ideals and ideas of the poet John Hewitt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnhewittsociety.org/about-us/|title=About Us|publisher=John Hewitt Society|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society runs an annual summer school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnhewittsociety.org/summer-school/|title=Summer School|publisher=John Hewitt Society|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lion of Babylon''' is a stone sculpture that was found in the ancient city of [[Babylon]], Iraq. 

== History ==
It was discovered in 1876 by a German archaeological mission. 

It was initially proposed that the statue was built by the Babylonian king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] (605-562 BC), but the style and materials of the statue have led others to ascribe it to the [[Hittites]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/06/iraq-babylon-culture-heritage.html#ixzz4DYTfkbw6&lt;/ref&gt; It could have been part of spoils captured by the Babylonians during the campaigns of Nebuchadnezzar II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlastours.net/iraq/babylon.html |title=Babylon, Iraq |publisher=Atlastours.net |date= |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 The World Monuments Fund worked with the Iraq State Board of Antiquities to make improvements to the site. The Lion was cleaned and partially restored, the base of the statue was replaced, and a security barrier was added.&lt;ref&gt;https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/KgJSt2M6VEvZIQ&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The statue is made out of black basalt black stone; it depicts a [[Mesopotamian lion]] standing above a laying human. The statue is two meters in length and the platform upon which it stands is one meter. 

== Symbolism ==
The [[Lion of Babylon]] is a historic theme in the region. 
The statue is considered among the most important symbols of (Babylon) in particular and Mesopotamian art in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tammuz.tumblr.com/post/10643679550/a-1932-photograph-of-the-lion-of-babylon-from-the |title=Babylon Chronicle, A 1932 photograph of the Lion of Babylon from the |publisher=Tammuz.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue is considered a national symbol of Iraq, it has been used by several Iraqi institutions such as the [[Iraqi Football Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifa.iq/ |title=الاتحاد العراقي لكرة القدم |publisher=Ifa.iq |date= |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are examples of [[retroactive continuities]] (or retcons).

==Film==
*''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), features [[Obi Wan Kenobi]] telling [[Luke Skywalker]] that [[Anakin Skywalker|Anakin Skywalker (Luke's father)]], was betrayed and killed by [[Darth Vader]]. The sequel film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), plot has Vader reveal himself as Anakin Skywalker (Luke's father). [[George Lucas]] decided to merge both characters while writing ''The Empire Strikes Back''. The following film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983) has Obi-Wan, justifying his original description of Vader having 'murdered' Anakin, as being truth from "a certain point of view" because from his point of view when Anakin became Vader he destroyed everything that was good about his former friend and apprentice. Similarly [[Princess Leia]] had been previously set as an upper-class romantic interest for the farm boy Luke; but in ''Empire Strikes Back'' Leia falls in love with [[Han Solo]], so in order to avoid a possible love triangle, ''Return of the Jedi'' reveals Leia as Luke Skywalker's twin sister (and therefore, daughter of Darth Vader), Lucas had originally planned Luke's sister to be a separate character, before deciding to accommodate it into the already established Leia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secrethistoryofstarwars.com/ |title=東京の婚活パーティーってどんなの？ |publisher=Secrethistoryofstarwars.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rogue One]]'' (2016) explains the improbable vulnerability of the [[Death Star]] in ''A New Hope'' to small rebel ships as a consequence of deliberate sabotage on the part of the key Death Star architect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vulture.com/2016/12/rogue-one-star-wars-retcon-death-star.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' (2015) the seventh entry of the ''[[Rocky (film series)|Rocky]]'' film series which serves as a sequel and spin-off to 2006's ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' (the sixth film), contains a major change into the continuity of the previous films. ''Creed'' establishes that during the events of ''[[Rocky IV]]'', Rocky's friend and rival [[Apollo Creed]] had an affair that resulted in a woman's pregnancy shortly before his boxing match against [[Ivan Drago]] during which Apollo dies on the ring. Months after the fight, the woman gives birth to [[Adonis Creed]], the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed. Adonis never meets his father and is the protagonist of the film ''Creed''; furthermore the film reveals Apollo won the fight at the end of ''[[Rocky III]]'' implying that that is the reason why Apollo agreed to fight Ivan Drago.&lt;ref&gt;http://screenrant.com/rocky-40th-anniversary-retcon/&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Godzilla (franchise)#Heisei series (1984–1995)|Heisei]] and [[Godzilla (franchise)#Millennium series (1999–2004)|Millennium]] eras of the ''[[Godzilla]]'' film series, the events of the [[Godzilla (franchise)#Shōwa series (1954–1975)|Showa]] era after the [[Godzilla (1954 film)|original film]] never happened.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} In particular, each film in the Millennium series – except for ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'', which serves as the direct sequel to ''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' – serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tohokingdom.com/articles/art_mill_conti.htm |title=Godzilla Millennium Series Continuity |publisher=Tohokingdom.com |date=2005-07-19 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', [[Jon Favreau]]'s son Max appears as a child wearing an Iron Man mask whom Stark saves from a drone. This was [[retcon|retroactively]] made the introduction of a young [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] to the MCU, as confirmed in June 2017 by eventual Spider-Man actor [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], [[Marvel Studios]] president [[Kevin Feige]] and ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' director [[Jon Watts]].&lt;ref name="PeterParker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-holland-officially-confirms-spider-man-was-in-iron-man-2_us_59508ea4e4b0da2c731c7080|title=Tom Holland Confirms Popular Fan Theory: Spider-Man Was In ‘Iron Man 2’|last=Bradley|first=Bill|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=June 26, 2017|accessdate=June 26, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6rVzoB543?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-holland-officially-confirms-spider-man-was-in-iron-man-2_us_59508ea4e4b0da2c731c7080|archivedate=June 26, 2017|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PeterParker2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/peter-parker-iron-man-2-jon-watts/|title=‘Spider-Man: Homecoming’ Director Jon Watts Explains Real Story Behind Peter Parker’s ‘Iron Man 2’ Cameo|last=Ryan|first=Mark|work=[[Uproxx]]|date=June 27, 2017|accessdate=June 27, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6rXDt2Exj?url=http://uproxx.com/movies/peter-parker-iron-man-2-jon-watts/|archivedate=June 27, 2017|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
*When [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] killed off his character [[Sherlock Holmes]] by plunging him to his death over the [[Reichenbach Falls]] with his nemesis [[Professor Moriarty]], the public's demand for Holmes was so great that Doyle was compelled to bring him back to life in a subsequent story, where he details that Holmes had merely faked his death.
*Though the term "retcon" did not yet exist when [[George Orwell]] wrote ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', the totalitarian regime depicted in that book is involved in a constant, large-scale retconning of past records. For example, when it is suddenly announced that "Oceania was not after all in war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia and Eurasia was an ally" (Part Two, Ch. 9), there is an immediate intensive effort to change "all reports and records, newspapers, books, pamphlets, films, sound-tracks and photographs" and make them all record a war with Eastasia rather than one with Eurasia. "Often it was enough to merely substitute one name for another, but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination. Even the geographical knowledge needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable." See [[historical revisionism (negationism)]].
*When [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the character of ''[[Sauron|The Necromancer]]'' was not originally intended to be more than an abstract "bad guy" concept because ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' had not yet been conceived.  However, as Tolkien developed ''The Lord of the Rings'', the abstract ''Necromancer'' came to be "discovered" to be [[Sauron]].

==Television==

*In 2004, ''[[Coronation Street]]'' retconned the Baldwin family after [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]'s nephew [[Danny Baldwin|Danny]] and wife [[Frankie Baldwin|Frankie]] moved to the area from [[Essex]], with their two sons [[Jamie Baldwin|Jamie]] and [[Warren Baldwin|Warren]]. Mike had been portrayed as an only child prior to this moment, with [[Frank "Frankie" Baldwin|his father]] appearing in the program between 1980 and 1982 to confirm the notion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
*''[[First of the Summer Wine]]'', the prequel to the long-running British sitcom ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'', retconned the character Seymour Utterthwaite as a pre-World War II friend of the other central characters. Seymour had been introduced into later series of ''Last of the Summer Wine'' and was previously unknown to the stalwart characters, Compo and Clegg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First of the Summer Wine, Uncovered |url=http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/ozfan.htm |accessdate=23 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082703/http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/ozfan.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The revived series of British science fiction television program ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and its television [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s use retroactive continuity as a plot device. 
**Show runner [[Steven Moffat]]'s [[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|fifth series finale]] depicted the Doctor [[reset button technique|rebooting the universe]]. In answer to a fan's question, Moffat tweeted: "The whole universe came exactly as it was. Except for any continuity errors I need to explain away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/steven_moffat/status/80157148893556736 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724045625/http://twitter.com/steven_moffat/status/80157148893556736 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 July 2012 |title=Steven Moffat: ...The whole universe... |work=Steven Moffat on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=13 June 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**In the [[Doctor Who (series 6)|sixth series]], Moffat introduces new aliens the [[Silence (Doctor Who)|Silence]], who erase your memory of them the moment you look away. Commenting on this device, writer [[MaryAnn Johanson]] writes, "That could be happening throughout this story... indeed, through the entire history of ''Doctor Who''. Moffat has just created a pretty much unassailable narratively sound reason for inserting retcons ''anywhere'' throughout the half-century history of the show."{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
**In the [[The Name of the Doctor|seventh series finale]], Moffat creates a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor known as the [[War Doctor]] in the run-up to the show's 50th anniversary special "[[The Day of the Doctor]]".&lt;ref name="HurtDoctor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/10065201/Doctor-Who-The-Name-of-the-Doctor-BBC-One-review.html|title=Doctor Who: The Name of the Doctor, BBC One, review|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=22 May 2013|author=Hogan, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is shown in the mini-episode "[[The Night of the Doctor]]" [[retroactive continuity|retroactively inserted]] into the show's fictional chronology between the [[Eighth Doctor|Eighth]] and [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] Doctors, although his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors.&lt;ref name="HurtDoctorNumber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a533505/doctor-who-steven-moffat-on-regeneration-limit.html?rss|title='Doctor Who': Steven Moffat on regeneration limit|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=24 November 2013|accessdate=25 November 2013|author=Rigby, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 50th anniversary special "[[The Day of the Doctor]]", Moffat revealed, that at the last instant of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], the Doctor hid his war-torn home planet in time, rather than destroy it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
** In the ''Doctor Who'' spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'', created by [[Russell T Davies]], a drug used to erase the memory of characters is called "retcon"; the use of the drug is often referred to by characters as "retconning".{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==''Star Trek'' in various media==

*When ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' was released in 1979, [[Gene Roddenberry]] claimed that the radically different appearance of the [[Klingon]]s in the film was how they were always supposed to have looked, but they did not have the budget for it in the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In the 1990s, an episode of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' featured three Klingon characters from the original series, made to fit the new look. However, the later episode "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]", used footage from the original series with old-look Klingons; Commander [[Worf]] acknowledged their different appearance, saying it was "a long story" and, after receiving incredulous looks, added with a scowl "we do not discuss it with outsiders."
*A 2005, two-episode arc of ''Star Trek: Enterprise'', "[[Affliction (Enterprise episode)|Affliction]]"/"[[Divergence (Enterprise episode)|Divergence]]", revealed that the Klingons that appeared in the 1960s episodes were the product of genetic engineering using augmented human [[genes]]. This explanation was used in [[Shane Johnson (author)|Shane Johnson]]'s 1989 ''The Worlds of the Federation'': "The 'Klingons' encountered along the Federation border with the Empire were a Klingon-human fusion, genetically created to infiltrate the Federation. The interception of the Amar transmission during the V'Ger incident revealed the true nature of the Imperial Klingon race and stunned Federation science. Before that time, no one had suspected the Klingons were capable of such advanced genetic engineering, and a great deal of rethinking was done concerning the level of Klingon technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Shane|last2=Punchatz|first2=Don Ivan|title=The Worlds of the Federation|date=1989|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn=9780671708139|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; John M. Ford, in ''The Final Reflection'', suggests that human-Klingon fusions are similar to the human-Vulcan fusion that resulted in Spock's birth.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Video games==

*The chronology of ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series was subject to much debate among fans until an official timeline was printed in the collector's book ''[[The Legend of Zelda#Fictional chronology|Hyrule Historia]]'', released in Japan on December 21, 2011.&lt;ref name="Official Legend of Zelda Timeline Revealed"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://gamecrunch.co/2011/12/22/official-legend-of-zelda-timeline-revealed/ |title=Official Legend of Zelda Timeline Revealed |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2011-12-22 |accessdate=2016-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426070944/http://gamecrunch.co/2011/12/22/official-legend-of-zelda-timeline-revealed/ |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/ |title=Nintendo of Europe &amp;#124; Nintendo |publisher=Officialnintendomagazine.co.uk |date=2015-08-15 |accessdate=2015-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031155115/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/ |archivedate=2014-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyrule Historia contains a timeline that explains how each game fits within the storyline. This includes introducing a three-way split after ''Ocarina of Time''. ''The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword'' helps explain the appearance of multiple Zelda, Link and Ganondorf characters across hundreds of years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
*The original ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]'' trilogy for the NES was followed years later by a new series of sequels produced by [[Team Ninja]] beginning with ''[[Ninja Gaiden (2004 video game)|Ninja Gaiden]]'' for the Xbox in 2004. However, the second generation of ''Ninja Gaiden'' video games, being prequels to original series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mielke |first=James |url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3164447 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522141623/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=1&amp;cId=3164447 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-22 |title=Ninja Gaiden 2 Preview for 360 from |publisher=1UP.com |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2015-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yin |first=Wesley |url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/ninja_gaiden_2/preview-948.html |title=Ninja Gaiden 2 Interview for Xbox 360 |publisher=VideoGamer.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081205161412/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/ninjagaidenii/news.html?sid=6191514&amp;part=rss&amp;subj=6191514 ]&lt;/ref&gt; has many differences from the NES trilogy. The character design of [[Ryu Hayabusa]] in the new games is now based on the ''[[Dead or Alive (franchise)|Dead or Alive]]'' incarnation of the character with long hair and green eyes, the character design of Ryu's father, Ken Hayabusa, has been updated as well, the character now being addressed in the English versions by his original name in the Japanese versions (Jo Hayabusa), and producer Tomonobu Itagaki hints at the possibility that Sonia, a character from the new games, might be Irene Lew from the original series.&lt;ref name="gamespot1"/&gt; With the release of ''[[Dead or Alive: Dimensions]]'' in 2011, it has been revealed that Sonia is indeed Irene Lew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video game | title = Dead or Alive: Dimensions | developer = Team Ninja| publisher = Tecmo| date = 2011-05-24| platform = Nintendo 3DS| version = 1.0| level = Chapter 2| quote = '''Ryu Hayabusa''': Hayate, meet Irene /...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a-mn2EVpFI&amp;t=10m7s |title=Dead or Alive Dimensions Nintendo 3DS Chronicle Mode Chapter 2 Part 3 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[Metal Gear (video game)|Metal Gear]]'', the character [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]] serves as [[Solid Snake]]'s commanding officer and is apparently revealed near the end of the game to also be the main antagonist. However, ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' establishes the antagonist character to actually be a body double of the real Big Boss, called Venom Snake, who is killed by Solid Snake during this encounter. The original Big Boss later becomes the antagonist in the series' second entry, ''[[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title= Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain |developer= Kojima Productions |publisher= Konami |date= 2015-09-01 |platform= PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PC |version= |scene= |level= Truth: The Man Who Sold The World |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the ending of 2006's ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', Sonic and Elise blow out the flame of Solaris, undoing all changes made by Iblis and causing the entire story to never happen; thus undoing all the inconsistencies the game's plot caused. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Ignored sequels in various media==

*The film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' loosely continues the storylines of ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Superman II]]'', and disregards the events of ''[[Superman III]]'' and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=superman-returns |title=Movies |publisher=Superman Homepage |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'' is the only entry in the series that does not feature the series antagonist [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], nor does it include story elements from either ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) or ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981). In fact, it treats the first film and, apparently, its sequel as [[Story within a story#Film within a film|fictional films]], as one of the characters watches a trailer for the original during the film; additionally, the film's tagline is a reference to the tagline from the original as well. The film ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' is a direct sequel to ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' and ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'', dismissing the events that take place in the sequels ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'', ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'' and ''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]''. The subsequent film ''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]'' follows the new continuity of ''Halloween H20'', however, it retcons that film's ending in order to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karina Wilson |url=http://www.horrorfilmhistory.com/index.php?pageID=1970s |title=Horror Film History — Horror Films in the 1970s |publisher=Horrorfilmhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 film, [[Halloween (2018 film)|''Halloween'']], will be a direct sequel to the [[Halloween (1978 film)|original film]] while disregarding the previous sequels from [[canon (fiction)|canon]], and [[retcon]]ing the ending of the first film.&lt;ref name="DontPeople"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/danny-mcbride-halloween-just-hope-dont-fk-piss-people-off-183213419.html |title=Danny McBride on 'Halloween': 'I just hope that we don't f*** it up and piss people off' |last=Bierly |first=Mandi |date=2017-11-13 |website=[[Yahoo!]] |access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The film ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' is a sequel to ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and ignores the events of ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/64113/the-exorcist-iii.html |title=The Exorcist III (2015), directed by William Peter Blatty &amp;#124; Film review |publisher=Timeout.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Highlander II: The Quickening]]'' is a sequel to the first film, but its events are ignored by later films in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qwipster.net/highlander3.htm |title=Highlander: The Final Dimension review (1994) Highlander 3 - Qwipster's Movie Reviews |publisher=Qwipster.net |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''[[Highlander: Endgame]]'' ignores the events of both ''Highlander II'' and ''[[Highlander III: The Sorcerer]]'' and only follows the events of the [[Highlander: The Series|TV series]] and the first film.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
*''[[Texas Chainsaw 3D]]'' and its prequel ''[[Leatherface (2017 film)|Leatherface]]'' follow the continuity of ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', ignoring the events of the other sequels.
*The fifth film in the [[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator series]], ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' (2015), completely disregards the events of the third and fourth Terminator films, ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' (2003) and ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' (2009). In the upcoming [[Terminator 6|sixth Terminator film]] in 2019, ''Terminator Genisys'' itself will be ignored, in addition to ignoring the 2003 and 2009 sequels. Only the [[The Terminator|original 1984 film]] and the first sequel ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991) will be considered canon to the 2019 film.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5349">'''The Magdalena Project''' is an international network of women in contemporary [[theatre]] and [[performance]]. It aims to increase awareness of women's contributions to theatre and to create the artistic and economic structures and support networks to enable women to work.

==Background==

The idea for a network of women theatre practitioners was born in a café in [[Trevignano]], Italy in September 1983, during a festival of alternative theatre: a discussion on the predominance of male directors and writers at the festival led Jill Greenhalgh to ask what such a festival might be like if the primary creative voices were those of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bassnett |first=Susan |authorlink= |title=Magdalena: International Women's Experimental Theatre |origyear=1989 |year=1989 |publisher=Berg Publishers Limited |location=Oxford |isbn=0-85496-016-3 |pages=19–20 |chapter=The Birth of Magdalena}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by this, Greenhalgh organised MAGDALENA '86 - The First International Festival of Women in Contemporary Theatre, in [[Cardiff]], Wales in August 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fry |first=Chris |authorlink= |title=The Way of Magdalena |origyear=2007 |year=2007 |publisher=The Open Page Publications |location=Denmark |isbn=978-87-87292-13-9 |pages=33–51 |chapter=Magdalena '86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at this event the Magdalena Project was founded.

From then until 1999, The Magdalena Project operated from an administrative base in Cardiff, with a board of advisors and Greenhalgh as its artistic director. During this period the Magdalena Project produced performances, organised workshops and festival gatherings in Europe and published a regular newsletter.

In 1988, women theatre practitioners in Latin America became involved, organising meetings in Peru, Colombia and Uruguay, and extending the network to Chile and Argentina with further meetings in 1993. This was to be the beginning of growing interest in the Project from around the world, with affiliate groups forming and hosting festivals and events in many countries.

In 1999, the [[Arts Council of Wales|Welsh Arts Council]] ceased its infrastructure funding of the Magdalena Project, necessitating the closure of the Cardiff office and the cessation of most cost-bearing activities. However, by this time the network was strongly established at an international level, and was about to launch its web site and email list. The move into online communications ensured the continuation of the network despite the loss of funding.

==International Festivals and Affiliate Groups==

The international membership of the Magdalena Project network is made up of individuals (men and women), theatre companies and organisations; in some locations affiliate Magdalena groups have been formally established. These groups are autonomous and all of their activities are organised and funded locally.

The Latin American network has been operating since 1988 with festivals in Argentina (1999, 2003), Colombia (2002, 2006), Cuba (2005, 2008), Peru (2006) and Brasil (2008). In Argentina, the network has operated under the name Magdalena 2nd Generacion since 1999.

In 1997 Magdalena Aotearoa was officially established in New Zealand and an international festival of women’s performance was held there in 1999. Other festivals outside Europe were held in Australia (2003), USA (2005) and Singapore (2006). The Transit Festival of Women’s Performance is held approximately every three years at [[Odin Teatret]], Denmark, organised by Julia Varley, one of the founders of the Magdalena Project. Other companies and festivals that are connected to the Magdalena Project include [[Grenland Friteater]], Teatro delle Radici, AMAR, DAH Teater, Voix de Femmes, Voix Polyphoniques, Teatret OM, [[Double Edge]] and others.

'''Membrane structures''' are spatial structures made out of tensioned membranes. The structural use of membranes can be divided into [[pneumatic structure]]s, [[tensile membrane structure]]s, and cable domes. In these three kinds of structure, membranes work together with cables, columns and other construction members to find a form. Membranes are also used as non-structural cladding, as at the [[Beijing National Stadium]] where the spaces between the massive steel structural members are infilled with PTFE coated glass fiber fabric and ETFE foil. The other major building on the site, built for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], is the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]], also known as the Water Cube. It is entirely clad in 100,000 square metres of inflated ETFE foil cushions arranged as an apparently random cellular structure.

==Materials==

The common membranes used in membrane structures include:
* [[PVC]] coated [[polyester]] fabric
* Translucent [[Polyethylene]] fabric
* PVC coated [[glass fiber]] fabric
* [[PTFE]] coated glass fiber fabric; foils like 
* [[ETFE]] foil
* PVC foil.

'''Music informatics''' is an emerging interdisciplinary research area dealing with the production, distribution, consumption, and analysis of music through technology (especially in digital formats).

Music Informatics research topics include music technologies such as peer-to-peer application, digital audio editors, online music search engines and [[Music information retrieval]]; cognitive, social, and economic issues in music; as well as improvisation and music performance. It studies this range of topics not only to better design music search and retrieval systems, but to develop a fundamental understanding of the nature of music and its associated behaviors as well. Because music informatics is an emerging discipline, it is a very dynamic area of research with many diverse viewpoints, whose future is yet to be determined.

==Sub-topics in Music Informatics research==
* Interdisciplinary relationships in Music Informatics
* The digital revolution in music its impact on music information services and music libraries
* Knowledge of current trends in music technologies including software and hardware
* Mental models in the [[Music psychology|cognition of music]] listening and performing
* Symbolic music modeling systems and computer-aided composition
* Social and economic realities of the consumption of music in Western societies
* [[Improvisation]] in music, especially where it is facilitated by music technology
* Music digital libraries and collections architectures
* Future of music distribution, the music industry, and music libraries
* [[Music information retrieval]]
* Music [[Recommendation system|Recommendation systems]]
* Studying and Synthesizing Music Expression
* Audio Signal-to-Score (singing, polyphonic, piano, etc.)
* [[Musical analysis]]
* Musical Accompaniment Systems
* Score Following
* [[Optical music recognition|Optical Music Recognition (OMR)]]
* Music Source Separation
* Music for Computer Games
* MIDI to Symbolic Score

==Music informatics in education==
Music informatics, as a [[Academic degree|degree]] subject, offers a similar learning experience to [[music technology]], but goes further into learning the principles behind the technology.&lt;ref name="sussex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/courses/music-informatics/overview.php |title=Music Informatics |accessdate=2008-04-20 |publisher=University of Sussex}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Informatics students will not just use existing music hardware and software, but will learn [[computer programming|programming]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3658">'''''{{lang|bs|Nada}}''''' (''Hope'') was a [[Bosnia]]n literary and arts magazine published between 1895 and 1903. It was the first Bosnian magazine comparable to other European cultural journals.&lt;ref name="antić-2014"&gt;{{ cite web | last =  Antić | first = Marina | year = 2014 | title =  Historicizing Bosnia: Kosta Hörmann and Bosnia’s Encounter with Modernity | url = https://www.academia.edu/200925/Historicizing_Bosnia_Kosta_Hormann_and_Bosnias_Encounter_with_Modernity }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had the backing of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] monarchy; [[Kosta Hörmann]] and [[Béni Kállay]] were the driving force behind the magazine's founding. Hörmann would serve as its editor. After Kállay died in 1903, the magazine lost its impetus, and Bosnian nationalism shifted into a new form. The magazine remains an invaluable source of information on cultural life in Bosnia in the period.&lt;ref name=lipa-2006&gt;{{ cite web | last = Lipa | first = Aida | url = http://www.kakanien.ac.at/beitr/fallstudie/ALipa1.pdf | title = The Austro-Hungarian Period in Bosnia and Herzegovina: Cultural Politics in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Creation of the Western Type of Art | publisher = Kakainen Revisited }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

[[Ewald Arndt Čeplin]] was the magazine's chief illustrator for its entire life. His brother Leo, [[Ivana Kobilca]] and [[Maximilian Liebenwein]] were the other permanent illustrators; 23 reproductions of Kobilca's other work also appeared on its pages. These four formed the obscure 'Sarajevo Painter's Club', and launched exhibitions of original art and illustrations from ''Nada'' in Austria, Germany and Hungary.&lt;ref name=lipa-2006 /&gt;

==Cultural politics==

In the period that the magazine was published, Austria-Hungary were occupying Bosnia and exercised ''de facto'' control, but had not yet formally annexed the region. ''Nada'' was explicitly a cultural project of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Its aim was to "diminish or entirely eliminate the influence of the Croatian and the Serbian newspapers and magazines and making the domestic opposition newspapers". The name itself reflects this: Hörmann chose it to signify "hope in the progress of the people towards Austria", by reinforcing the Bosnian sense of nationality. It set out to be secular and did not seek "open conflict", but instead sought "morally correct reporting" with horizons beyond just Bosnia or the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.&lt;ref name=lipa-2006 /&gt; Kecmanović (1963) takes the position that Hörmann and Kállay pursued the policy of inventing an "artificial" Bosnian identity to aid Austria-Hungary in [[Catholicism|Cathlocicising]] the region, which first required Serbian "denationalisation".&lt;ref name="antić-2014" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14507">'''National cinema''' is a term sometimes used in [[film theory]] and [[film criticism]] to describe the films associated with a specific nation-state. Although there is little relatively written on theories of national cinema it has an irrefutably important role in [[globalization]]. Film provides a unique window to other cultures, particularly where the output of a nation or region is high. Countries like South Korea, Russia and Iran have over the years produced a large body of critically acclaimed films. Regardless of the stories or styles of filmmaking the medium inherently contains a dense wealth of information about people and places through which audiences gain knowledge.[[File:First look launch of Baahubali 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|The [[Cinema of India|Indian Cinema]] produces movies in over 18 languages and sells more tickets than any other country in the world.]]Like other film theory or film criticism terms (e.g., "[[art film]]"), the term "national cinema" is hard to define, and its meaning is debated by film scholars and critics. A film may be considered to be part of a "national cinema" based on a number of factors. Simply put, a "nation's cinema" can be attributed to the country that provided the financing for the film, the language spoken in the film, the nationalities or dress of the characters, and the setting, music, or cultural elements present in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Choi.

Available at: http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/vp01.cfm?outfit=ifilm&amp;folder=17&amp;paper=22&lt;/ref&gt; To define a national cinema, some scholars emphasize the structure of the film industry and the roles played by "...market forces, government support, and cultural transfers..."&lt;ref&gt;Tom O' Regan ''Australian National Cinema'', cited in Jimmy Choi.

&lt;/ref&gt;
More theoretically, national cinema can refer to a large group of films, or "a body of [[textuality]]... given historical weight through common intertextual 'symptoms', or coherencies".&lt;ref name="Vitali, V. 2006"&gt;Vitali, V., &amp; Willemen, P. (2006). Theorising national cinema. London: Bfi (British Film Institute) Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Theorising National Cinema'', Philip Rosen suggests national cinema is a conceptualization of: (1) Selected 'national' films/texts themselves, the relationship between them, which be connected by a shared (general) symptom. (2) an understanding of the 'nation' as an entity in synchronicity with its 'symptom'. And (3) an understanding of past or traditional 'symptoms', also known as history or historiography, which contribute to current systems and 'symptoms'.&lt;ref name="Vitali, V. 2006"/&gt; These symptoms of intertextuality could refer to style, medium, content, narrative, narrative structure, costume, [[Mise-en-scène]], character, background, cinematography. It could refer to cultural background of those who make the movie and cultural background of those in the movie, of spectatorship, of spectacle.

==Canada==
Canadian cultural and film critics have long debated how Canadian national cinema can be defined, or whether there is a Canadian national cinema. Most of the films shown on Canadian movie screens are US imports. If "Canadian national cinema" is defined as the films made in Canada, then the canon of Canadian cinema would have to include lightweight teen-oriented fare such as ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]''(1979), ''[[Porky's]]'' (1983) or ''[[Death Ship (1980 film)|Death Ship]]'' (1980). Other critics have defined Canadian national cinema as a "...reflection of Canadian life and culture." Some critics argue that there are "two traditions of filmmaking in Canada." The "documentary realist tradition" espoused by the federal government's [[National Film Board]] and avant-garde films.

Scott MacKenzie argues that by the late 1990s, if Canada did have a popular cinema with both avant-garde and experimental elements, that was influenced by European filmmakers such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Wim Wenders]]. MacKenzie argues that Canadian cinema has a "...self-conscious concern with the incorporation of cinematic and televisual images", and as examples, he cites films such as [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[Videodrome]]'' (1983), [[Atom Egoyan]]'s'' [[Family Viewing]]'' (1987), [[Robert Lepage]]'s ''[[The Confessional]] (Le Confessionnal)'' (1995) and [[Srinivas Krishna]]'s ''Masala'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Scott MacKenzie, University of Glasgow. National Identity, Canadian Cinema, and Multiculturalism. Available at: https://archive.is/20121201023833/http://www.uqtr.ca/AE/vol_4/scott.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
France's national cinema includes both popular cinema and "avant-garde" films. French national cinema is associated with the [[auteur theory|auteur]] filmmakers and with a variety of specific movements. Avant-garde filmmakers include [[Germaine Dulac]], Marie and [[Jean Epstein]]. [[Poetic Realism]] filmmakers include [[Jean Renoir]] and [[Marcel Carné]]. The [[French New Wave]] filmmakers include [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[François Truffaut]]. The 1990s and 2000s "[[postmodernism|postmodern]] cinema" of France includes filmmakers such as [[Jean-Jacques Beinex]], [[Luc Besson]] and [[Coline Serreau]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Hayward. French National Cinema&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
During the German [[Weimar Republic]], German national cinema was influenced by silent and sound "Bergfilm" (this translates to "mountain film"). During the 1920s and early 1930s, German national cinema was known for the progressive and artistic approaches to filmmaking with "shifted conventional cinematic vocabulary" and which gave actresses a much larger range of character-types.&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"&gt;''German National Cinema'', by Sabine Hake. London and New York: Routledge, 2002. Trade paper, {{ISBN|0-415-08902-6}}. Reviewed by Robert von Dassanowsky. Available at: http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/38/booksgerman.htm&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Nazi]] era, the major film studio UFA was controlled by Propaganda Minister [[Goebbels]]. UFA produced "Hetzfilme" (anti-Semitic hate films) and films which emphasized the "theme of heroic death." Other film genres produced by UFA during the Nazi era included historical and biographical dramas that emphasized the achievements in German history, comedy films, and propaganda films.&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"/&gt;

During the [[Cold War]] from the 1950s through the 1980s, there were West German films and East German films. Film historians and film scholars do not agree whether the films from the different parts of Cold War-era Germany can be considered to be a single "German national cinema." Some West German films were about the "immediate past in sociopolitical thought and in literature". [[East Germany|East German]] films were often [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-funded "socially critical" films. Some East German films examined Germany's [[Nazi]] past, such as Wolfgang Staudte's ''Die Mörder sind unter uns'' (''The Murderers Are Among Us'').&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"/&gt;

The New German Cinema of the 1970s and 1980s included films by directors such as [[Fassbinder]], [[Werner Herzog|Herzog]], and [[Wim Wenders]]. While these directors made films with "many ideological and cinematic messages", they all shared the common element of providing an "aesthetic alternativ(e) to [[Classic Hollywood cinema|Hollywood]]" films and "a break with the cultural and political traditions associated with the [[Third Reich]]"(159).&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"/&gt;

==Poland==
After World War II, the Lódz Film School was founded in 1948. During the 1950s and 1960s, a "Polish School" of filmmakers developed, such as [[Wojciech Has]], [[Kazimierz Kutz]], [[Andrzej Munk]] and [[Andrzej Wajda]]. According to film scholar Marek Haltof, the Polish School of directors made films which can be described as the "Cinema of Distrust." In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wajda, Krzysztof Zanussi and Barbara Sass made influential films which garnered interest outside of Poland. However, even though Western countries became increasingly interested in Polish cinema during this period, the country's film infrastructure and market was disintegrating.&lt;ref&gt;Shelia Skaff. The cinema that is Marek Haltof's ''Polish National Cinema''. Review of Marek Haltof's book Polish National Cinema. Available at: http://www.kinoeye.org/02/14/skaff14.php
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==
Although it is difficult to determine and define a 'national cinema', much of what many consider Mexican national cinema, but not limited to, is [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema|Golden Age of Mexican Cinema]] and films that revolve around the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Unique trajectories of Mexican cinema's development shaped historically specific understandings of the ontology of the moving image, leading to unique configurations of documentation and fictionalization. The Revolution spilled across pages of the press, and became the primary subject of Mexican films produced between 1911 and 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Navitsky, Rielle Public Spectacles of Violence: Sensational Cinema and Journalism in Early Twentieth-Century Mexico and Brazil Durham, NC: Duke University Press 344 pp., $27.95, {{ISBN|082236963X}} Publication Date: June 2017. History: Reviews of New Books. 46. 71-72. 10.1080/03612759.2018.1436314.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a high interest in topicality in and capturing current events as they unfolded, re-staging, or combining both approaching, created a sensationalist appeal in these visual 'records' of death and injury. Compilation documentaries, such as Toscano's [[Memories of a Mexican|Memorias de un Mexicano]] in the years following the Mexican Revolution can be seen as part of a broader cultural politics of nationalism that worked to naturalize and to consolidate the political and ideological story of the revolution.

Later narrativized dramas, such as [[María Candelaria]], [[The Pearl (film)]], [[Enamorada (film)]], [[Río Escondido (1948 film)|Rio Escondido]], Saián Mexico, or [[Pueblerina]] by [[Emilio Fernandez]] and/or [[Gabriel Figueroa]], are often considered part of the Mexican national cinematic body. These films, and most popular films of the 1920s in Mexico, adopted [[David Bordwell]]'s "cinematic norms": narrative linkage, cause and effect, goal oriented protagonists, temporal order or cinematic time, and filmic space as story space. But also, is noted to have incorporated visual folkloric style of [[José Guadalupe Posada]], the deconstructing landscapes of [[Gerardo Murillo]], and the low angles, deep focus, diagonal lines, and 'native' imagery in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s [[Que Viva Mexico]] ! Although a mélange of Western and Mexican influences coexist in Fernandez's films, his Mexican biography and locality leave a legacy of romanticizing Mexico and Mexican history, often presenting idyllic ranches, singing, and a charming life of the poor.

Although of European heritage, [[Louis Buñuel]]'s work in Mexico is another example that presents 'symptoms' of Mexican national identity.  Although less well received by lower classes, and more admired by upper classes, Buñuel's [[Los Olvidados]] stands as an example that a director's national heritage doesn't always have to contribute to the conceptualization of a nation's cinema. Rather than building the nation through celebration, the film presents problem, which contribute to a global identity and context of the nation state. Buñuel, however, is less interested in presenting some 'identity' of message, national or international, and remarked that "to ask whether the film is Mexican or not, is to resist, to seek, to disperse, the very mystery this film articulates for us".

Modern genres embraced and nurtured as 'Mexican national cinema' are often those of the social and family melodrama genre, such as [[Como agua para chocolate]] (1991) by Alfonso Arau, the working class melodrama (i.e. Danzon in 1991 by Maria Novaro), the comedy (i.e. Sólo con tu pareja, 1991, Alfonso Cuarón) and the rural ''costumbrismo'' film (i.e. La mujer de Benjamin, 1990, by Carlos Carrera). Changes in the politics of film industry instituions allowed these film texts and their directors to "transform the traditional filmic paradigm". Up to 60% of financial assistance for national, Latin American, and European productions were provided by the [[:es:Instituto Mexicano de Cinematograf%C3%ADa|Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografia]], new models of co-production were created, and distribution and sales channels were opened abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Torres San Martin, Patricia. “The Guadalajarans’ Amores Perros.” Comunicación y Sociedad, núm. 37 , June 2000, pp. 179–202., doi:10.15417/1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Real Husbands of Hollywood''''' (abbreviated '''''RHOH''''') was an American [[reality television]] parody on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] which debuted on January 15, 2013.&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web|title="Real Husbands of Hollywood" and "Second Generation Wayans" to Premiere Tuesday, January 15 on BET|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/11/28/real-husbands-of-hollywood-and-second-generation-wayans-to-premiere-tuesday-january-15-on-bet-645515/20121128bet01/|publisher=thefutoncritic|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The series was co-created by comedian Kevin Hart, and follows the daily lives of him and other married celebrities, each playing a fictionalized version of themselves, as they venture through their [[wikt:surreal|surreal]] life in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BET Networks Unveils New Programming at 2012 Upfront Presentation|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/04/12/bet-networks-unveils-new-programming-at-2012-upfront-presentation-999101/20120412bet01/|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the initial cast include: [[Boris Kodjoe]], [[Nelly]], [[Duane Martin]], [[J.B. Smoove]], [[Nick Cannon]], Oliver (Hart's assistant, played by James Davis), and [[Robin Thicke]], who did not return for the second season due to his music career, though Hart has stated that the door is open for Thicke to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Apr 7, 2013 |url=http://blackamericaweb.com/115037/video-kevin-hart-explains-why-robin-thicke-left-real-husbands/ |title=Kevin Hart Explains Why Robin Thicke Left 'Real Husbands' |publisher=Black America Web |date=2013-04-07 |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is intentionally filmed in a style similar to [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[The Real Housewives]]''. Episodes often hinge on the "real" Kevin Hart's desperately unsuccessful attempts to climb Hollywood's celebrity social ladder (which always backfire in humiliating ways), and the character's barely-hidden jealousy of his more successful celebrity friends. A sneak peek was shown as a segment during the [[2012 BET Awards]] and the official promo was released in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Berkshire |first=Geoff |title=BET's 'Real Husbands of Hollywood' with Nick Cannon, 'Second Generation Wayans' get January premieres |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/11/bets-real-husbands-of-hollywood-with-nick-cannon-second-generation-wayans-get-january-premieres.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130210022/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/11/bets-real-husbands-of-hollywood-with-nick-cannon-second-generation-wayans-get-january-premieres.html |archivedate=November 30, 2012 |publisher=[[Zap2it]] |department=From Inside the Box (blog) |access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many views are held or have been expressed by '''religious organisations''' in relation to '''same-sex marriage'''. Arguments both in favor of and in opposition to [[same-sex marriage]] (or [[equal marriage rights]]) are often made on religious grounds and/or formulated in terms of religious doctrine. Although the majority of world religions oppose to same-sex marriage, the number of religious denominations that are conducting same-sex marriages have been increasing in recent times. Religious views on same-sex marriage are closely related to [[Homosexuality and religion|religious views on homosexuality]].

==Religious support==
{{See also|LGBT matters and religion}}

===Buddhism===
{{See also|Buddhism and sexual orientation}}
Due to the ambivalent language about homosexuality in [[Buddhist]] teachings, there has been no official stance put forth regarding the issue of marriage between members of the same gender.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life: Issues. (May 20, 2008. [http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=291 ''Religious Groups' Official Positions on Same-Sex Marriage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109194247/http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=291 |date=2008-11-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no objection of the Buddha found in the Tipitaka. Buddha was neither supportive nor against marriages between members of the same gender. Also, from the Tipitaka, it is clear that the Buddha acknowledged the difference between hermaphrodites and homosexual practitioners. Hermaphrodites and eunuchs are not allowed to be ordained, but there is no sanction against homosexuality. As for the lay homosexual people, Buddha gave no rule or advice as to whether they should be allowed to marry or not. Buddha posted himself simply as the one who shows the way. He did not insist that he had any right to enforce on others what they should do. With this principle, the original teachings of the Buddha do not cover social ceremonies or rituals. Weddings and marriages of all kinds are regarded as mundane and have no place in Buddhism.&lt;ref name = Mettanando&gt;Mettanando Bhikkhu (July 13, 2005). [http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,1429,0,0,1,0 ''Religion and Same-Sex Marriage.''] The Buddhist Channel: Bringing Buddha Dharma Home - Issues. ''The Bangkok Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 1995, some religious leaders gave testimony to the Commission on Sexual Orientation and the Law in support of same-gender marriages. [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], co-founder and teacher of the Honolulu Diamond Sangha, a Zen Buddhist society established in 1959, with centers in Manoa and Palolo, gave written testimony on the subject of same-sex marriage. Aitken explains that by applying the Four Noble Abodes (loving kindness, compassion, joy in the attainment of others, and equanimity) to the issue of same-sex marriage, he finds compassion for and with the gay or lesbian couple who wish to confirm their love in a legal marriage. Aitken cites a precept about sex which Zen Buddhists inherit from earlier classical Buddhists teachings.

It is one of the sixteen precepts accepted by all Zen Buddhist monks, nuns and seriously committed lay people. He understands this to mean that self-centered sexual conduct is inappropriate, and he vows to avoid it. He believes that self-centered sex is exploitive sex, non-consensual sex, sex that harms others.  It is unwholesome and destructive in a heterosexual as well as in a homosexual context. He goes on to explain that The Legislative Reference Bureau compiled a formidable list of rights that are extended to married couples in Hawai'i, but which are denied to couples
who are gay and lesbian.

He argues that gay and lesbian unions would be "settled even more" if they were acknowledged with basic married rights. Aitken says, "A long-standing injustice would be corrected, and the entire gay and lesbian community would feel more accepted. This would stabilize a significant segment of our society, and we would all of us be better able to acknowledge our diversity. I urge you to advise the Legislature and the people of Hawai'i that legalizing gay and lesbian marriages will
be humane and in keeping with perenniel principles of decency and mutual encouragement."&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, T. (January 6, 1996). [http://www.qrd.org/qrd/religion/zen.buddhist.perspective.on.same.sex.marriage "A Zen Buddhist perspective on same-gender marriage."]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{See also|Christianity and sexual orientation|Christianity and homosexuality}}
Support and affirmation of marriage rights for same-sex couples generally comes from certain Christian denominations that are considered theologically liberal. Some examples of religious organizations voicing their support for same-sex marriage include [[Metropolitan Community Church]], the [[United Church of Christ]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/lgbt/issues/marriage-equality/|title=Marriage Equality and the UCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Church of Canada]], the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheFourPrioritiesoftheChurch/tabid/273/Default.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916035526/http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheFourPrioritiesoftheChurch/tabid/273/Default.aspx |date=September 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church of the United States]], the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church In America]],the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]],  the [[Church of Denmark]], the [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Church of Norway]], the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]], the [[United Protestant Church of France]], the [[United Protestant Church in Belgium]], the [[Icelandic Church]], the [[Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau]], the [[Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia]], the [[Evangelical Church in the Rhineland]], the [[Protestant Church in Baden]],the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany]], the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]], the [[Quaker]]s, the liberal [[Old Catholic Church]] and the [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalists]] church which supports the rights of gays and lesbians to marry both in the church and through the state.&lt;ref&gt;

Some biblical scholars who hold to a more theologically liberal Christian view of same-sex marriage, such as representatives of the Metropolitan Community Church, make the claim that the word "homosexual" as found in many modern versions of the Bible is an interpolation and is not found in the original biblical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohnsmcc.org/new/BibleAbuse/ |title=Welcome - Bible Abuse Directed at Homosexuals |publisher=Stjohnsmcc.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument from scripture holds that since the original authors of the Bible never mention 'homosexuals' or committed Christian homosexual couples, there cannot exist a biblical prohibition of marriage rights for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaychurch.org/Gay_and_Christian_YES/the_bible_christianity_and_homosexuality_justin_cannon.htm |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923075213/http://www.gaychurch.org/gay_and_christian_yes/the_bible_christianity_and_homosexuality_justin_cannon.htm |archivedate=September 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the MCC, biblical texts interpreted by some as references to homosexuality refer only to specific sex acts and idolatrous worship which lack relevance to contemporary same-sex relationships.&lt;ref name="Rev1990"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Christians]] who support religious and legal recognition of same-sex marriage may base their belief in same-sex marriage on the view that marriage, as an institution, and the structure of the family is a biblical moral imperative that should be honored by all couples, heterosexual and homosexual alike. Supporting marriage rights for gays and lesbians reflects their Christ-like commitment to the equality and dignity of all people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaychurch.org/Gay_and_Christian_YES/Other%20articles/justified_through_Christ.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126093800/http://www.gaychurch.org/Gay_and_Christian_YES/Other%20articles/justified_through_Christ.htm |date=November 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gc2009.org/ViewLegislation/view_leg_detail.aspx?id=986&amp;type=Final|title=ページが見つかりません。|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wouldjesusdiscriminate.com/ |title=Would Jesus Discriminate? |publisher=Wouldjesusdiscriminate.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a theologian from the United Church of Canada, "human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, are a gift from God."&lt;ref name="EqualityRights2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology |title=Equality Rights |publisher=United Church of Canada |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313234743/http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology |archivedate=March 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sergebac7thcentury.jpg|thumb|Historian [[John Boswell (historian)|John Boswell]] claims the 4th century Christian martyrs [[Saints Sergius and Bacchus|Saint Sergius and Saint Bacchus]] were united in the rite of [[adelphopoesis]], or brother-making, which he calls an early form of religious same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The Marriage of Likeness: Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe (New York: Villard, 1994),&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Some same-sex married couples have challenged religious organizations that exclude them from access to public facilities maintained by those organizations, such as schools, health care centers, social service agencies, summer camps, homeless shelters, nursing homes, orphanages, retreat houses, community centers, and athletic programs.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91486340|title=Gay Rights, Religious Liberties: A Three-Act Story|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of same-sex marriages have expressed concerns that this limits their religious freedoms.&lt;ref name=BannedInBoston&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/191kgwgh.asp|title=Banned in Boston|date=15 May 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, conservatives worry that a Christian college would risk its tax-exempt status by refusing to admit a legally married gay couple to married-student housing.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/10/us/10beliefs.html|title=Will Same-Sex Marriage Collide With Religious Liberty?|first=Peter|last=Steinfels|date=10 June 2006|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some legal analysts suggest that failure to reflect gay rights within their organizations may cost some religious groups their tax-exempt status.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/09/AR2009040904063.html|title=Faith Groups Increasingly Losing Legal Battles Over Gay Rights|first=Jacqueline L.|last=Salmon|date=10 April 2009|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious arguments for and against marriage rights for same-sex couples are not always evenly divided among theologically conservative religious groups and liberal groups.  While self-identified theological liberal organizations such as the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), support same-sex marriage, other more conservative and or orthodox organizations including some [[Mennonite]] churches, the [[Church of the Brethren]], the [[Old Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/front/Church_agrees_to_bless_gay_partnerships.html?siteSect=105&amp;sid=6817696&amp;cKey=1150533957000&amp;ty=st |title=Church agrees to bless gay partnerships - SWI |publisher=Swissinfo.ch |date=2006-06-17 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of Sweden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/8899/20071025/ |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201090612/http://www.thelocal.se/8899/20071025/ |archivedate=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also support marriage rights for gay and lesbian persons.&lt;ref&gt;King, Michael A.

The [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] (as of 2015: 7,115 open parishes and missions; 2,009,084 active baptized members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.episcopalchurch.org/files/2013_table_of_statistics_0.pdf|title = Table of Statistics of the Episcopal Church|date = 2013|accessdate = 2015-07-02|website = Episcopal Church|publisher = Episcopal Church|last = |first = |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;) at their 2009 [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] declared that: "bishops, particularly those in dioceses within civil jurisdictions where same-gender marriage, civil unions, or domestic partnerships are legal, may provide generous pastoral response to meet the needs of members of this Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/11/30/episcopal_bishop_approves_priests_role_in_same_sex_marriages_in_eastern_mass/|title=Episcopal role OK’d in gays’ weddings|last=Paulson|first=Michael|date=November 30, 2009 |publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 2012, the Episcopal Church passed a resolution that was to be voted on later to approve an official [[liturgy]] for blessing same-sex unions. This liturgy, called "''The Witnessing and Blessing of a Lifelong Covenant,''" would enable priests to bestow the church’s blessing on same-sex couples; priests could refuse to perform marriages, and bishops could prohibit same-sex marriage in their diocese. Denial would come without penalty, but the priest or diocese would have to direct same-sex couples they decline to another church or priest willing to perform the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Episcopal Church approves religious weddings for gay couples after controversial debate|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/07/01/why-the-episcopal-church-is-still-debating-gay-marriage/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-07-01|access-date = 2015-07-02|issn = 0190-8286|language = en|first = George|last = Conger|at = Para. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was confirmed on July 9, 2015 (three years later) on a 129 for and 26 against (with 5 abstaining) vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2015/07/episcopalians-vote-to-allow-same-sex-marriage-in-churches/2/|agency = Associated Press|title = Episcopalians Vote to Allow Same-Sex Wedding Ceremonies in Churches|first = Brady|last = McCombs|date = 2015-07-01|via = LGBTQ Nation|last2 = Zoll|first2 = Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metropolitan Community Church====
The [[Metropolitan Community Church]] (43,000 members) sees its mission being social as well as spiritual by standing up for the rights of minorities, particularly those of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. MCC has been a leading force in the development of [[Queer theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward R. Gray, ''Gay religion By Scott Thumma'',  Alta Mira Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the MCC is notable for publicly supporting same-sex marriage as early as the 1960s. Notably in 1970 [[Troy Perry]], the church's founder, filed the first lawsuit in the U.S. seeking legal recognition for same-sex marriages. Perry lost that lawsuit but launched the debate over same-sex marriage in the U.S. Today, MCC congregations around the world perform more than 6000 same-sex marriage ceremonies annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=edited by Stephen|title=Contemporary Christianity and LGBT sexualities|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Pub.|location=Farnham, Surrey, England|isbn=9780754676249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presbyterian Church USA====
The [[Presbyterian Church USA]] General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission ruled in 2006 that same-sex ceremonies are not forbidden, as long as they are not considered to be the same as marriage services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfn.org/2006/01/msg00291.html|title=wfn.org - [PCUSANEWS] Austin pastor won't be tried on gay 'marriage' accusation|website=www.wfn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Debate on the issue within the church evolved over the years. In 2000, the General Assembly had approved language for the church constitution that stated church teachings were that people were "to live           either in fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman or in chastity in singleness.," and barred church officers and property from being used for blessing or approval upon any other form of fidelity relationship, but ratification for this language was never obtained by the presbyteries. By 2014, the General Assembly passed an Authoritative Interpretation permitting pastors to sign marriage licences for same-gender couples where permitted by civil law in the states where their church was found, which took immediate effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc-biz.org/PC-Biz.WebApp_deploy/(S(zbcely2njokyzcp51e0oharv))/IOBView.aspx?m=ro&amp;id=4599|title=PC-Biz|website=www.pc-biz.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 2015, ratification by a majority of presbyteries was reached on a constitutional amendment passed by that same 2014 General Assembly, which broadened the definition of marriage in the Directory for Worship from only being between "a man and a woman," to "two people, traditionally a man and a woman," thus giving official sanction to, while not making it mandatory for, any congregation's pastor to preside over and bless marriage ceremonies for same-gender couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/us/presbyterians-give-final-approval-for-same-sex-marriage.html|title=Largest Presbyterian Denomination Gives Final Approval for Same-Sex Marriage|first=Laurie|last=Goodstein|date=17 March 2015|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Church of Christ====
The United Church of Christ's General Synod (998,906 members) passed a resolution affirming "equal marriage rights for all people regardless of gender" in 2005. The church allows but does not require pastors to perform same-sex weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====United Church of Canada====
The [[United Church of Canada]] (600,000 members) was active in the campaign that led to legal recognition of same-sex marriages in Canada. The United Church now allows individual congregations to decide whether or not to perform these marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/recognition |title=Equal Marriage Civil Recognition of Same-Sex Partnerships |publisher=United Church of Canada |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011081832/http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/recognition |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, in the Protestant Church of the Netherlands, where same-sex marriages have been legal since 2001, individual congregations decide if they will perform them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians support religious and legal recognition of same-sex marriages based on a moral commitment to equality, or a belief that "human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, are a gift from God", as affirmed by the United Church of Canada's 37th General Council.&lt;ref name="EqualityRights2007"/&gt;

====Liberal Catholic theologians====
{{See also|Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism}}
Even within the Roman Catholic Church, there can be found a few a groups who support for same-sex marriage. For example, while the Vatican and most of the Roman Catholic hierarchy oppose same sex marriages, there are a few Catholic theologians who support gay marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiousconsultation.org/Catholic_defense_of_same_sex_marriage.htm|title=After 2 more deaths Planned Parenthood alters method for abortion pill (printer friendly)|website=www.religiousconsultation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critical biblical scholarship====
According to [[Daniel A. Helminiak]],&lt;ref&gt;Helminiak, Daniel A. (2000). ''What the Bible Really Says About Homosexuality: Millennium Edition.'' New Mexico: Alamo Square Press, pages 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bible]] may be interpreted literally or within historical-cultural context.  Under a literalist reading, the Bible can be read as condemning [[homosexuality]] (and, by extension, gay marriage).&lt;ref name="Helminiak, Daniel A. 2000 page 131"&gt;Helminiak, Daniel A. (2000). ''What the Bible Really Says About Homosexuality: Millennium Edition.'' New Mexico: Alamo Square Press, chapter nine: Summary and conclusion, page 131&lt;/ref&gt;  Read in cultural context, the Bible "was not addressing our current questions about sexual ethics and does not condemn gay sex [or gay marriage]s as we understand it today."&lt;ref name="Helminiak, Daniel A. 2000 page 131"/&gt; Helminiak argues that Biblical passages said to be against homosexuality (and same-sex marriages) do not actually say anything against gay and lesbian sexual relationships or identity. "The sin of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] was inhospitality, not homosexuality. [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] condemns sex with [[angels]], not sex between two men. Not a single Bible text indisputably refers to lesbian sex. [...] there follows no valid conclusion whatsoever about homosexuality. Biblical figures [...] may well have been involved in homogenital relationships, seen as part of God's plan. And Jesus himself said nothing at all about homosexuality, not even when face to face with a man in a gay relationship."&lt;ref name="Helminiak, Daniel A. 2000 page 131"/&gt; [[Lisa Miller (journalist)|Lisa Miller]] also argues for a move beyond [[Biblical literalism|literalism]]. The Bible was written for a world unlike our own.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, D.S. (1975). ''Homosexuality and the Western Christian Culture.'' Anchor Books: Hamdon, CT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bratcher, Dennis (2006). "Community and Testimony: Cultural Influence in Biblical Studies" in ''The Voice: Biblical and Theological Resource for Growing Christians.''[http://www.crivoice.org/community.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monogamy]], for example, only became the norm in the [[Christian]] world in the last 150 years or so.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Israel C.S. (July, 1998): "The History of Monogamy" in [http://www.patriarchywebsite.com/monogamy/mono-history.htm ''Patriarchy Website.'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, Miller argues that the Bible supports the idea of monogamous relationships, including gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Lisa. "Our Mutual Joy: Opponents of gay marriage often cite Scripture. But what the Bible teaches about love argues for the other side" in ''NEWSWEEK.'' From the magazine issue dated Dec 15, 2008. [http://www.newsweek.com/id/172653/output/print]&lt;/ref&gt; Robin Kar argues that same-sex marriage is partly the result of certain religious and spiritual developments within Judeo-Christian society, which led to love-based marriages in the West.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3049650|title=Transformational Marriage: How to End the Culture Wars Over Same-Sex Marriage|first=Robin|last=Kar|date=8 October 2017|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, there are now religious reasons for Christians to support "transformative" marriage for all people and to dispense with the assumption that same-sex marriage reflects encroaching secularism.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Hindus===
{{See also|Homosexuality and Hinduism}}
There are both conservative and liberal views about homosexuality and same-sex marriages in [[Hinduism]], similar to many other religions.  A liberal view is presented by Mathematician Shakuntala Devi, in her 1977 book, ''The World of Homosexuals'', in which she interviewed Srinivasa Raghavachariar, head priest of the Srirangam temple. He said that same-sex lovers must have been cross-sex lovers in a former life. The sex may change but the soul retains its attachments, hence the love impels these souls towards one another.&lt;ref&gt;"It started in 1977 with the publication of a book by a woman who is better known as a mathematician. Shakuntala Devi's The World of Homosexuals can be said to have inaugurated social-reformist homophilic Indian writing in English. She concluded her book by calling for not only the decriminalisation of homosexuality in India, but also its 'full and complete acceptance' by the heterosexual population so that the Indian homosexual may lead a dignified and secure life." Arvind Narrain and Gautam Bhan (eds). (2005) [http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue14/chatterjee_review.html ''Because I Have a Voice: Queer Politics in India.''] New Delhi: Yoda Press. Devi, Shakuntala (1977). ''The World of Homosexuals'', Delhi: Vikas, (p. 155).&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002, Ruth Vanita (writer/reporter for ''GALVA - The Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association, Inc.'') interviewed a Shaiva priest who performed the marriage of two women; having studied Hindu scriptures, he had concluded, "Marriage is a union of spirits, and the spirit is not male or female" (p.&amp;nbsp;147).&lt;ref&gt;Vanita, Ruth (2006). [http://www.galva108.org/lovesrite.html ''Love’s Rite: Same-Sex Marriage in India and the West'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As Amara Das Wilhelm, a Krishna devotee and founder of GALVA, notes in his book, ''Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex'', "several Gaudiya Vaishnava authorities emphasize that since everyone passes through various forms, genders and species in a series of lives, we should not judge each other by the material body but view everyone equally on a spiritual plane, and be compassionate as God is."&lt;ref&gt;Das Wilhelm, Amara (2004). [http://www.galva108.org/galvabook.html ''Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex - Understanding Homosexuality, Transgender Identity and Intersex Conditions Through Hinduism.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ruth Vanita, "Indian newspapers, over the last 25 years, have reported several same-sex weddings and same-sex joint suicides, mostly by Hindu female couples in small towns, unconnected to any gay movement. Several weddings took place by Hindu rites, with some family support, while the suicides resulted from families forcibly separating lovers." According to Vanita, the phenomena of increased visibility of same-sex weddings "...suggest the wide range of Hindu attitudes to homosexuality today. The millennia-long debate in Hindu society, somewhat suppressed in the colonial period, has revived. In 2004, Hinduism Today reporter Rajiv Malik asked several Hindu swamis (teachers) their opinion of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1300&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The swamis expressed a range of opinions, positive and negative. They felt free to differ with each other; this is evidence of the liveliness of the debate, made possible by the fact that Hinduism has no one hierarchy or leader. As Mahant Ram Puri remarked, "We do not have a rule book in Hinduism. We have a hundred million authorities."&lt;ref&gt;Vanita, Ruth (2008).

Many supporters of same sex marriages argue&lt;ref name=Glassman&gt;Glassman, Anthony. (July 15, 2005).

[http://www.southsidepride.com/2004/04/articles/gaymarriage.html "Freedom of religion and gay marriage"] in ''Southside Pride: Phillips/Powderhorn/Nokomis/Riverside.''&lt;/ref&gt; that, by defining the institution of marriage as between one man and one woman, the state automatically tramples upon the constitutional rights to freedom of religion.  They argue that just because a majority of religious organizations may believe that gay marriages should not be granted by the state does not make it the state's obligation to observe their opinions on this matter.&lt;ref name="atheism.about.com"&gt;Cline, A. [http://atheism.about.com/od/gaymarriage/a/MarriageSacred.htm "Arguments Against Gay Marriage: Marriage is a Sacred Religious Sacrament Gay Marriage Would Be a Sacrilege and Thus Must Be Banned?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Amendment to the [[United States Constitution]], which is part of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], expressly forbids laws being made "respecting an establishment of religion" and that prohibit the free exercise of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_Am1.html|title=U.S. Constitution - Amendment 1 - The U.S. Constitution Online - USConstitution.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment01/01.html#1|title=U.S. Constitution - FindLaw|website=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to this argument, the state has no authority to define marriage as between one man and woman because there are various religions which hold that gay marriage is morally equivalent to heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref name = Glassman/&gt;&lt;ref name = Dix/&gt;

[[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] prominently expresses concern that heterosexual-only marriage laws impose a specific religious doctrine as state policy.

====Catholic Church opposition====
{{See also|Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] argues from a theological perspective against recognizing same-sex unions.  According to Catholic moral doctrine, acts of sexual intimacy are only proper between a man and a woman within wedlock.  Secular government recognition of any other union within the definition of "marriage" would therefore reflect a belief in the moral equivalence of acts between a husband and wife and acts between two men or two women; this belief is contrary to Catholic doctrinal teaching.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Catholic opponents also argue that inclusion of same-sex unions within the definition of marriage would also evidence rejection of the idea that, in general, it is best that children be raised by their biological mother and father, and that it is the community's interest in ensuring the well-being of children is the sole basis for the government's licensee and involvement in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, ''Considerations Regarding Proposals to Give Legal Recognition to Unions between Homosexual Persons'' (2003) [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20030731_homosexual-unions_en.html] (visited January 20, 2008) (statement by Vatican department charged with promoting and safeguarding the doctrine on the faith and morals throughout the Catholic world).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John Paul II]], then head of the Roman Catholic church, criticized same-sex marriage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pope criticizes 'purple' legislation on gay marriage (in Dutch)|url=http://www.refdag.nl/oud/kl/001024kl04.html|publisher=refdag.nl|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was introduced in the Netherlands in 2001. His successor [[Pope Benedict XVI]] maintained opposition to the institution, considering it amongst "the most insidious and dangerous threats to the common good today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-05-13-pope-abortion-gays_N.htm | work=USA Today |location =Washington DC |title=Pope: Abortion, gay marriage among world's greatest threats |date=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pope: "Gay marriage is a threat to world"|url=http://www.gk.nl/index.php?id=9&amp;a=bericht&amp;bericht=7793|publisher=gk.nl|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Views in Scripture=====
{{See also|The Bible and homosexuality}}
Within the [[Christian]] tradition, religious objections to same-sex marriages are often based upon the [[Bible]].

Some religious arguments against same-sex marriage are based upon [[Old Testament]] [[bible|biblical]] passages such as [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 19:4-11, [[Leviticus]] 18:22, and [[Leviticus]] 20:13,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles2/GagnonHomosexuality.php |title=Robert Gagnon - The Bible and Homosexual Practice: An Overview of Some Issues |publisher=Orthodoxytoday.org |date=2010-02-02 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/september/11.36.html |title=What God Hath Not Joined |publisher=Christianity Today |date=2004-09-01 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianfamilylawassociation.org/same-sex_relationships |title=A Christian Perspective on Same-Sex RelationshipsNeither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor reviler, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 |publisher=Christian Family Law Association |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nosamesexmarriage.com/marriage/bible_verses.php|title=The Bible and No Same Sex Marriage|website=nosamesexmarriage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others are based upon [[New Testament]] [[bible|biblical]] passages such as [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1, [[I Corinthians]] 6:8-10, and [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] 1:7.&lt;ref name="ref_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref" /&gt;  [[Conservatism|Conservative]] Christians note that the book of [[Leviticus]] contains a prohibition against male-male sexuality.  While the Biblical passages mentioned above do not define the institution of marriage, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2:22-24 reads as follows:  "Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. The man said, 'This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man.' For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+2:22-24&amp;version=31|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 2:22-24 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage is quoted by [[Jesus]] in the [[New Testament]] [[Gospel]] of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+19:4-5;&amp;version=31;|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 19:4-5 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evangelical opposition====
According to Reverend [[Rick Warren]], a pastor of the conservative [[Evangelical Christian]] [[Saddleback Church|Saddleback]] [[megachurch]], homosexuals are people who "think they are smarter than God" and who choose "to disobey God's sexual instructions."&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/news/2008/12/rick-warren-transcript.aspx|title=Steven Waldman Interviews Rick Warren|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Warren’s point of view, marriage is an ordinance from God that unites a man and a woman.&lt;ref name=Warren /&gt; [[James Dobson]], in ''[[Marriage Under Fire]]'' and elsewhere, argues that legalization for or passive tolerance of same-sex marriages would widen the definition of families.

The [[ex-gay movement]] takes the view that I Corinthians 6:9-11 offers Christian believers [[Sexual orientation change efforts|freedom from the sin of homosexual behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exodus.to/content/view/313/87/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901081023/http://exodus.to/content/view/313/87/ |archivedate=2009-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.messiah.edu/~chase/h/articles/art1.htm|title=freeministry.org - This website is for sale! - freeministry Resources and Information.|website=home.messiah.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evangelical author and counselor [[Joe Dallas]] notes that the Biblical passages relating to homosexual behavior uniformly prohibit that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joedallas.com/resources/Relevance%20&amp;R.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Churches====
{{Main|Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Same-sex marriage}}
The [[Orthodox Church in America]]&lt;ref name="OnMarriage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oca.org/DOCmarriage.asp?SID=12&amp;ID=26|title=On Marriage, Family, Sexuality, and the Sanctity of Life|publisher=Orthodox Church in America|accessdate=2006-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also opposed to same-sex marriage, as is the [[Unification Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/asia/Unification_Church_pres_sees_smaller_mass_weddings_77510.shtml Unification Church pres sees smaller mass weddings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322013906/http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/asia/Unification_Church_pres_sees_smaller_mass_weddings_77510.shtml |date=2009-03-22 }}, [[The Monitor (Uganda)]], 2008-12-30, "Moon said the church does not give its wedding blessing to same sex couples."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (15 million members) believes that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that children are entitled to be raised by a mother and a father who honor their marital vows with complete fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]&lt;/ref&gt;  They believe marriage is not primarily a contract between individuals to ratify their affections and provide for mutual obligations, but is an important part of rearing children.  They teach that same-sex marriage undermines the purpose of marriage.&lt;ref name="TheDivine" /&gt;

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (8.2 million members) believes God condemns sexual activity that is not between a husband and his wife.  They teach that while the bible condemns homosexual acts, it does not condone hatred of homosexuals or homophobia.&lt;ref&gt;http://hwww.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/questions/bible-about-homosexuality/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodox Judaism===
{{See also|LGBT topics and Judaism}}
Judaism, like Christianity, reflects differing views between conservative and liberal adherents.  [[Orthodox Judaism]] maintains the traditional Jewish bans on both sexual acts and marriage amongst members of the same sex. The Orthodox Union in the United States supported a federal Constitutional amendment  banning same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, Orthodox Response to Same-Sex Marriage, NY Jewish Week (Mar. 26, 2004) http://www.ou.org/public_affairs/article/ou_resp_same_sex_marriage/ (visited January 20, 2008); Rabbinical Council of America, Joining with Three Other Orthodox Organizations, RCA Opposes Redefinition of Marriage in New York State (June 21, 2007) http://www.rabbis.org/news/index.cfm?type=policies (visited January 20, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note that recent research by Chana Etengoff &amp; Colette Daiute suggest that positive reconciliations between sexual minority individuals and Orthodox Jewish family members is possible (a process referred to as theistic mediation),&lt;ref&gt;Etengoff, C. &amp; Daiute, C. (2014). Family Members’ Uses of Religion in Post–Coming-Out Conflicts With Their Gay Relative. Psychology of Religion and Spirituality. 6(1), 33-43. doi: 10.1037/a0035198&lt;/ref&gt; both with and without clinical support.&lt;ref&gt;Etengoff, C. &amp; Daiute, C., (2015). Clinicians’ perspectives of religious families’ and gay men’s negotiation of sexual orientation disclosure and prejudice, Journal of Homosexuality, 62(3), 394-426. doi: 10.1080/00918369.2014.977115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theravada Buddhists===
{{See also|LGBT topics and Buddhism}}
Thai [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhists]] (over 150 million members), being the more conservative wing of Buddhism are less supportive of gay rights and marriages. Human rights issues have received poor attention in Theravada countries, as the culture is rooted in the belief in the Law of Karma, which is more popular among Thai Buddhists than philosophical and advanced scriptural studies in Buddhism. Many monasteries and monks advocate their lay followers to see the world through the lens of karma, i.e., every person is born to pay back their sins. According to their explanations, all homosexuals and sexual deviants were once offenders of the Third Precept (prohibiting sexual misconduct) - at least in their past lives, and they must pay off their past sins in their present life. Therefore, they deserve all that society gives to them. This belief system creates strong conservative values in Theravada Buddhist culture. For these reasons, it is unlikely that Buddhists will easily approve a law to allow gay marriage. Gay and lesbian activists in Thailand will probably not be as successful as their fellows in European countries or Canada.&lt;ref name = Mettanando/&gt; It is important to note, however, that Theravada Buddhists outside of the South-East Asian Area, are generally more supportive, or neutral, to same-sex marriage, and LGBT rights as a whole.

== Freedom of religion ==
One source of controversy is how same-sex marriage affects [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/talk/2008/06/gay_marriage_conflict_between_1.html|title=Gay Marriage: Conflict Between Equal Rights and Religious Freedom?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is concern that religious communities might not be legally able to decide what type of marriages to solemnize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewforum.org/events/?EventID=216|title=A Clash of Rights? Gay Marriage and the Free Exercise of Religion|date=21 May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some same-sex married couples have challenged religious organizations that exclude them from access to public facilities maintained by those organizations, such as schools, health care centers, social service agencies, summer camps, homeless shelters, nursing homes, orphanages, retreat houses, community centers, and athletic programs.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; Opponents of same-sex marriage have expressed concerns that this limits their religious freedoms.&lt;ref name=BannedInBoston /&gt;  For example, conservatives worry that a Christian college would risk its tax-exempt status by refusing to admit a legally married gay couple to married-student housing.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Some legal analysts suggest that failure to reflect gay rights within their organizations may cost some religious groups their tax-exempt status.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;  In addition, religious opponents of same-sex marriage express concern about several specific instances in which they contend that religious freedoms have been abridged due to legal recognition of same-sex unions, including (a) an incident in Canada (which is subject to a different set of [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|laws concerning same-sex marriage]] than the United States), in which the Knights of Columbus were sued for declining to allow a same-sex wedding reception on their property;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianchristianity.com/cgi-bin/na.cgi?nationalupdates/050209lesbian]&lt;/ref&gt; (b) removal of real property tax exemption from a New Jersey Christian organization that did not allow a civil union ceremony to be performed on their property;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/new_jersey_attacks_religious_freedom_of_methodist_campground/|title=New Jersey attacks religious freedom of Methodist campground|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (c) requirements that judges and justices of the peace perform same-sex wedding ceremonies;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglican-mainstream.net/2008/04/08/legalizing-gay-marriage-will-spark-lawsuits-against-churches/]&lt;/ref&gt; and (d) the forced closing of Catholic adoption agencies which refused to place children in the homes of married same-sex partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=30209]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/same-sex_marriage_law_forces_d.c._catholic_charities_to_close_adoption_program/|title=Same-sex ‘marriage’ law forces D.C. Catholic Charities to close adoption program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a concern that religious people might be marginalized for their beliefs about marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=16199|title=New Hampshire law marginalizes supporters of traditional marriage, bishop says|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/04/07/DI2009040702538.html|title=Same-Sex Marriage: Opposing Views|first=David Catania and Brian|last=Brown|date=7 April 2009|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Opponents point to the way [[Carrie Prejean]] was treated during the [[Miss USA 2009 controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/30/miss-california-carrie-pr_0_n_193503.htmlMiss|title=California Carrie Prejean To Campaign Against Gay Marriage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also concerns about violence and intimidation against religious people.  After a vote to make same-sex marriage illegal in California, same-sex marriage supporters published names of donors to the bill and classified them based on religion and many religious symbols were targeted.  Elder [[Dallin H. Oaks]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, likened the attacks against religious people to voter intimidation against black people during the American civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/news-releases-stories/religious-freedom|title=Transcript of Elder Dallin H. Oaks Speech on Religious Freedom|date=13 October 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some governments have made special provisions for religious protections within the texts of same-sex marriage laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/23/us/23beliefs.html|title=Same-Sex Marriage Laws Pose Protection Quandary|first=Peter|last=Steinfels|date=22 May 2009|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] argue that by defining marriage as an opposite-sex institution, the state infringes upon the constitutional right to freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="Glassman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dix"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atheism.about.com"/&gt; In this view, religious groups that do wish to celebrate same-sex marriages are discriminated against when government policies do not permit their religious groups to celebrate marriages as they see fit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1971">'''Skaay''' was a blind, crippled [[storytelling|storyteller]] of the [[Haida people|Haida]] village of [[New_Clew,_British_Columbia|Ttanuu]] born c. 1827 at Qquuna. Skaay could [[illiteracy|neither read nor write]], but his stories of [[Haida mythology]] have survived in the form of written transcriptions taken down by [[John R. Swanton|John Swanton]] with the aide of Henry Moody over the winter of 1900. These transcriptions of myths are unique in the literature, both for their fidelity (due to Swanton) to the precise wordings of the mythteller, and for the survival of the pre-translation originals. 

The stories Skaay chose to dictate are the ''Qquuna Cycle'', the longest poem recorded in Haida, ''Qquuna Qiighawaay'', the oral history of Skaay's family, and ''Raven Travelling'', Skaay's original take on the well-worn tale (see [[Raven Tales]]).

Skaay appears three times in church records: first, in 1884 when he was baptized "Robert McKay"; second, on 13 March 1892, again a baptism, where his name is entered simply as "Sky"; third, in January 1894 when he registers a marriage to "Esther" and was baptized once more, this time as "John Sky". In [[Haida language|Haida]], 'Skaay' refers to a type of [[mollusk]]. The Haida were divided into two social groups, or [[descent group|moieties]], called Raven and Eagle. Skaay belonged to the Eagle side or [[descent group|moiety]].

== History ==
Studio 4 was created to provide a place for students to be grounded in acting and focus on performance while not having to be tied up with additional school requirements.  Franco wanted to emulate the creative environment he found at Playhouse West, in addition to providing opportunities through his production company, [[Rabbit Bandini Productions]], that would otherwise not available to acting, directing, or writing students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/james-franco-says-class-session/|title=James Franco Says Class Is in Session|newspaper=Backstage.com|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2014/02/one-more-hyphenate-for-james-franco-acting-school-headmaster-677054/|title=One More Hyphenate For James Franco: Acting School Headmaster|last=Jr|first=Mike Fleming|date=2014-02-04|newspaper=Deadline|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school offered a two-year [[Sanford Meisner|Meisner technique]] conservatory study for actors and on-going [[screenwriting]] and [[Film director|directing]] courses that were instructed by working industry professionals.  Among some of the school guests instructors and lecturers include: [[James Caan]], [[John Patrick Shanley]], [[Ahna O'Reilly]], [[Campbell Scott]], [[Scott Caan]], [[Paul Calderón|Paul Calderon]], Alex Morf, [[Pamela Romanowsky]], Joel Marsh Garland, [[Gabrielle Demeestere]], [[Natalie Gold]], [[Tom Leopold]], and [[Horatio Sanz]].

== Sexual misconduct allegations ==
In 2017, multiple female students of the school came forward and stated that Franco had behaved in inappropriate or sexually exploitative ways while serving as their teacher. One student stated that Franco "would always make everybody think there were possible roles on the table if we were to perform sexual acts or take off our shirts" in his projects. Another student stated that Franco held a sex scenes class and removed students' vaginal guards while simulating oral sex with them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-james-franco-allegations-20180111-htmlstory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Moomins and the Great Flood''''' (Swedish: ''Småtrollen och den stora översvämningen'', literally ''The Little Trolls and the Great Flood'') is a book written by [[Finland|Finnish]] author [[Tove Jansson]] in 1945, during the end of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26529309 |title=Tove Jansson: Love, war and the Moomins |last=Bosworth |first=Mark |publisher=BBC |date=13 March 2014 |accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first book to star the [[Moomins]], but is often seen as a prelude to the main Moomin books, as most of the main characters are introduced in the next book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Moomins' first adventure reaches UK |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/16/moomins-first-adventure-uk-publication |last=Flood |first=Alison |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Moominmamma and Moomintroll are travelling through a dark and scary forest looking for Moominpappa, who has gone off adventuring with the [[Hattifattener]]s. They meet a little creature, who joins them (in later books he is named Sniff). They use a glowing tulip to light their way, and are attacked by a giant serpent whilst crossing a swamp. They are saved when a beautiful young girl with shining blue hair called Tulippa emerges from the tulip and scares the serpent away.

They later arrive at a mountain and find the home of an old man, who invites them to live in his garden, which is made entirely of sweets. However, when they find out that the sun is really a giant lamp and there's no real food, they leave and continue their journey, travelling through the mountain to the beach on the other side. On the beach, Moominmamma gets attacked by an ant-lion, but Moomintroll and the others manage to save her. Deciding to move on, they come across a group of Hattifatteners about to set sail on a boat, and join them. A storm strikes, but a sea-troll helps them out and navigates the boat to a large harbour where they go ashore.

Parting ways with the Hattifatteners, they travel inland and meet a boy with red hair who lives in a lighthouse. Tulippa decides to stay with him, but the others set out after Moominpappa when they learn from the boy that he had passed through recently. Soon a rainstorm that lasts for several days causes a flood, and Moominmamma saves a family of cats. When the rain stops, they sail across the flooded landscape on an armchair and find a message in a bottle from Moominpappa, saying he has escaped the flood by climbing up a tree. As the water starts going down, they finally reach dry land and start searching for Moominpappa. Unsuccessful at first, they finally find him with the help of a [[marabou stork]] who flies them up into the air.

Reunited, the Moomin family and the little creature travel on until they find the house Moominpappa had built, carried into a small valley by the flood, and decide to live there.

==English translation==
This was the last Moomin book to be translated into English, in 2005, to celebrate 60 years of the Moomins. It was published by Schildts Förlags Ab publishing house in a limited hardback version. This book is still published by Schildts and could be bought on their website as of February 2011. The book gained a good reception from the Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The Moomins and the Great Flood by Tove Jansson – review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/07/moomins-great-flood-tove-jansson-review |last=Freud |first=Esther |authorlink=Esther Freud |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Poor Old Lady by Lorenzo Jaramillo on the 1901 edition of the book Moral Tales for Formal Children by Rafael Pombo.|The Poor Old Lady by Lorenzo Jaramillo, 1901.]]
"'''The Poor Old Lady is a [[fairy tale]], best known in [[Latin America]].  It was first published in the book ''Moral Tales for Formal Children'' in 1854 by the [[Colombian people|Colombian]] [[poet[Rafael Pombo]].  Due to the importance and impact of this play in [[Latin America]]n   children Latin American literature of the nineteenth century, "The Poor Old Lady" became one of the most memorable characters in the Colombian and Latin American childhood.  This paradoxical but amusing story is still reprinted in compilations of children stories and [[nursery rhyme]]s.

==Plot of the story==
"The Poor Old Lady" tells the story of a rich old lady who has everything (clothes, goods, food.).  However, in each verse of the story she is described as someone who complains about having nothing.  At the end, the poor old lady dies from all the alleged complications which she had.  In an ironic way the story ends with a particular phrase: “God grant that we can enjoy the poverty of that poor lady and die from the same ill.”

==Characters==
The story revolves around a unique character, the poor old lady, which is based on a commonly known social [[stereotype]].

==Commentary==
Like all tales and rhymes of [[Rafael Pombo]], "The Poor Old Lady" teaches children about everyday aspects of human beings and society.  Women and their insatiable desire to have many shoes and dresses,  and in a deeper layer this story deals with a main aspect: the human greed and exposes that material things are not the most important stuff in life.

The poor old lady explores 2 very basic human ensigns:

* ungratefulness and undermining of what she had 
* the constant see of what she lacks of. 

Negative or positive ensigns?
For many she was just a greedy lady that never noticed what she had was more than what many others had.
But we could imagine also that an old lady like her probably would have tried along her life all kind of drinks, and meals and shoes and beds and seats, which would have made of her a truly curious and exploratory person, perhaps insatiable.

| style="vertical-align: top" |&lt;poem&gt;The Poor old Lady

Once upon a time there was an old lady
With nothing to eat,
But meat, fruit, sweets,
Cakes, eggs, bread and fish.

She drank broth, chocolate,
Milk, wine, tea and coffee,
And the poor woman could not find
What to eat or what to drink.

And this old woman did not have
Not a little hut in where to live
But a large house
With its vegetables plot and its garden

No one, nobody cared for her
But Andrés and Juan Gil
And eight servants and two pages
with livery and bow-tie.

She never had anything to sit on
But chairs and sofas
With benches and cushions
And springs on the back.

Not another bed than a big one
More golden than an altar,
With soft feather mattress
A lot of silk and a lot of frills.

And this poor old lady
Every year, until her end,
She had one more year of age
And one year less to live.

And when looking herself in the mirror,
It always scared her there
Another old lady with glasses,
Little hat and a toupee.

And this poor old lady
Did not have what to dress,
But dresses of thousand styles
And of thousand and thousand fabrics.

And if not for his shoes,
Flip-flops, boots and booties,
Barefoot on the floor
was walking this wretch.

Appetite never had
When finishing eating,
Nor enjoyed complete health,
When she was unwell.

She died of wrinkle disease,
Already bent like a three,
And never complained again
Neither of hunger nor of thirst.

And this poor old lady
When she died, she left no more,
But money, jewels, lands, houses,
Eight cats and a turpial bird.

Rest in peace, and God allows
That we could enjoy
The poverty of that poor woman
And die as bad as she did.

----------------------------
La Pobre Viejecita

Érase una viejecita
Sin nadita que comer
Sino carnes, frutas, dulces,
Tortas, huevos, pan y pez

Bebía caldo, chocolate,
Leche, vino, té y café,
Y la pobre no encontraba
Qué comer ni qué beber.

Y esta vieja no tenía
Ni un ranchito en que vivir
Fuera de una casa grande
Con su huerta y su jardín

Nadie, nadie la cuidaba
Sino Andrés y Juan Gil
Y ocho criados y dos pajes
De librea y corbatín

Nunca tuvo en qué sentarse
Sino sillas y sofás
Con banquitos y cojines
Y resorte al espaldar

Ni otra cama que una grande
Más dorada que un altar,
Con colchón de blanda pluma,
Mucha seda y mucho olán.

Y esta pobre viejecita
Cada año, hasta su fin,
Tuvo un año más de vieja
Y uno menos que vivir

Y al mirarse en el espejo
La espantaba siempre allí
Otra vieja de antiparras,
Papalina y peluquín.

Y esta pobre viejecita
No tenía que vestir
Sino trajes de mil cortes
Y de telas mil y mil.

Y a no ser por sus zapatos,
Chanclas, botas y escarpín,
Descalcita por el suelo
Anduviera la infeliz

Apetito nunca tuvo
Acabando de comer,
Ni gozó salud completa
Cuando no se hallaba bien

Se murió del mal de arrugas,
Ya encorvada como un tres,
Y jamás volvió a quejarse
Ni de hambre ni de sed.

Y esta pobre viejecita
Al morir no dejó más
Que onzas, joyas, tierras, casas,
Ocho gatos y un turpial

Duerma en paz, y Dios permita
Que logremos disfrutar
Las pobrezas de esa pobre
Y morir del mismo mal&lt;/poem&gt;

|}

==Modern uses and adaptations==
The poor old lady is one of the most recognized characters of the [[Colombian culture]], and is commonly used in [[elementary school]] [[textbook]]s, [[nursery rhyme]]s, and [[Children's literature|child literature]] [[Anthology|compilation]]s.

In 1977, Fernando Laverde performed the [[Animation|animated film]] version of this story, which is considered the first animated film created in Colombia.

Representations of the character are used in [[parade]]s and [[carnival]]s.  In recent years, the theme parks Mundo Aventura and [[Colombian National Coffee Park]] have used [[animatronics]] versions of "The Poor Old Lady".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Walrus |url=http://thewalrus78.blogspot.com/2009/12/la-pobre-viejecita-una-rareza-del-cine.html |title=I AM THE WALRUS: La Pobre Viejecita: Una Rareza del Cine Animado Colombiano |publisher=Thewalrus78.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibliotecasvirtuales.com/biblioteca/literaturainfantil/Poesiainfantil/RafaelPombo/ |title=Rafael Pombo |publisher=Bibliotecasvirtuales.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208131539/http://www.bibliotecasvirtuales.com/biblioteca/literaturainfantil/Poesiainfantil/RafaelPombo/ |archivedate=2012-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/ninos/relatoi/rela3.htm |title=Rafael Pombo |publisher=banrepcultural.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Three Aunts'''" is a Norwegian [[fairy tale]] collected by [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]] in ''[[Norske Folkeeventyr]]''.&lt;ref&gt;George Webbe Dasent, ''Popular Tales from the Norse'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/asbjornsenmoe/threeaunts.html "The Three Aunts"]  Edinburgh: David Douglass, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A poor man made his living by shooting.  He had lost his wife, and one day, his pretty daughter decided to go seek her fortune.  She got a place with the queen, and worked so hard that she became a favorite.  The other women, jealous, told the queen that she had claimed to be able to spin a pound of flax in twenty-four hours.  The queen set her to do it.  She begged a room for herself but never having spun flax, could not do it.  An old woman came to her, got the story from her, and on the promise that the girl would call her "Aunt" on her wedding day, did the spinning for her.

The queen was pleased with it, making the other women more jealous.  They said the girl had said she could weave it all in twenty-four hours, and the queen set her to the task again.  Another old woman wove it for it, for the same price.  Then the women claimed she could sew it all into shirts in twenty-four hours, and a third old woman sewed them for the same price.

The queen decided to marry her to the prince, because such a worker would never need to hire working women.  The women came. The first was a hag with a nose three ells long, the second had a humped back, the third eyes like saucers, but the bride greeted them as "Aunt" and the prince had to seat them at the high table.  He asked why they were so hideous.  The first blamed her nose on her spinning, and the second her back on her weaving, and the third her eyes on her sewing.  The prince said that his bride would no longer spin, weave, or sew.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2615">In [[literature]], the '''tritagonist''' or '''tertiary main character''' (from {{lang-grc|τριταγωνιστής}}, ''tritagōnistḗs'', third actor) is the third most important [[Character (arts)|character]] of a narrative, after the [[protagonist]] and [[deuteragonist]]. In [[ancient Greek drama]], the tritagonist was the third member of the acting troupe.

As a character, a tritagonist may act as the instigator or cause of the sufferings of the protagonist.  Despite being the least sympathetic character of the drama, he or she occasions the situations by which pity and sympathy for the protagonist are excited.&lt;ref name="muller"&gt;[[Karl Otfried Müller|Müller, Karl Otfried]], and [[John William Donaldson]]. ''[https://archive.org/details/historyofliterat01mluoft A History of the Literature of Ancient Greece]'', 1858&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|451}}

==History==
The part of the tritagonist emerged from earlier forms of two-actor drama.  Where two actors only allowed for a principal character and their adversary, moving the part of adversary to a third actor (the tritagonist) allowed for the second actor (the deuteragonist) to play roles as a confidant or aide to the principal character, and thereby elicit greater character depth from the principal character by having the protagonist explain their feelings and motivations to an on-stage listener.&lt;ref name="muller" /&gt;{{rp|451}}  As Ancient Greek theater recitations were partly melodic, the role of the tritagonist would typically go to a performer with a voice in the [[bass (voice type)|bass]] range (as compared to the protagonist as tenor and the deuteragonist as baritone).&lt;ref name="mantzius"&gt;''A History of Theatrical Art'', Mantzius (1903).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|172}} [[Cicero]], in his ''[[Divinatio in Caecilium]]'', reported that the tritagonist (being a role of lesser importance than the protagonist) would often have to subdue his voice if he was naturally stronger than the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;''Divinatio in Caecilium'', [[Cicero]], s. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Ancient Greek actors who worked in this role include the orator [[Aeschines]], who was held by [[Demosthenes]] to have been untalented as a tritagonist,&lt;ref name="mantzius" /&gt;{{rp|175}} and Myniscus, who was tritagonist under the playwright [[Aeschylus]].&lt;ref name="mantzius" /&gt;{{rp|195}}

In some forms of Greek theater, it was traditional for the tritagonist to enter the stage from the left.&lt;ref name="muller" /&gt;{{rp|404}}

[[Image:Opponent color circle 1917.png|thumb|right|234px|A concept of four unique hues of
psychologist [[Charles Hubbard Judd]] (1917)]]

'''Unique hue''' is a term used in certain theories of [[color vision]], which implies that human perception distinguishes between "unique" (psychologically primary) and composite (mixed) hues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~ka519/Publications_files/Allen%20Locating%20the%20Unique%20Hues.pdf Locating Unique Hues]&lt;/ref&gt; A unique hue is defined as a [[color]] which an observer perceives as a pure, without any admixture of the other colors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aris.ss.uci.edu/~kjameson/KuehniCRA.pdf Variability in Unique Hue Selection]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a great deal of variability when defining unique hues experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1404500 | pmid=15002843 | doi=10.2466/pms.2003.97.3f.1038 | volume=97 | title=Focal colors and unique hues | journal=Percept Mot Skills | pages=1038–42 | last1 = Miyahara | first1 = E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the results show a great deal of interobserver and intraobserver variability leading to much debate on the number of unique hues.&lt;ref name="Unique hues and their stimuli"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/col.21793 | volume=39 | title=Unique hues and their stimuli-state of the art | year=2013 | journal=Color Research &amp; Application | pages=279–287 | last1 = Kuehni | first1 = Rolf G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of variability is environmental factors in color naming. Despite the inconsistencies, often four color perceptions are associated as unique; "[[red]]", "[[green]]", "[[blue]]", and "[[yellow]]".

==History==
[[File:Opponent colors.svg|right|thumb|240px|Approximations within the sRGB gamut to the "aim colors" of the [[Natural Color System]], a model based on the [[opponent process]] theory of color vision.]]

===Hering's opponent process theory===
{{main|Opponent process}}
The need for certain hues to be designated as unique came with the advent of [[Opponent process]] theory. [[Ewald Hering]] first proposed the idea that red, green, blue, and yellow were unique in 1892. His theory suggests that color vision is based on two opposing axes of color: a red-green axis and a blue-yellow axis. This theory is based strongly on the existence of perceptually [[impossible colors]] or color hue mixtures that have no meaning such as redgreen or yellowblue. These colors are perceptually impossible and suggest an opponent relationship between red and green, and blue and yellow.

==Physiological evidence==
[[File:Gray722.png|thumb|Signal path from the eyes to the LGN.]]
There has been considerable effort in neuroscience to establish physiological mechanisms correlating to the existence of unique hues. For some time it was thought that the opponent process was explained through two chromatic mechanisms inherent in the way signals from the three cone types (Long, Medium, and Short wavelengths) on the retina are processed. The first mechanism represents the red-green L-M process. The blue-yellow process was thought to be based on a similar (L+M)-S process. Recent research has shown that this (L+M)-S process does correspond to yellow as a unique hue.  This has led to the idea of unique hues being a result of higher order processing in the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] (LGN).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/300493.html Unique Hues]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural variability==
Unique hues have played an important role in understanding [[Linguistic relativity]] or the idea that language has a significant influence on thought. The way in which language and culture affects color naming is debated and not yet fully understood. The Universalist side of the debate argues that unique color terms are biologically tied to the human visual system and are the same regardless of language and culture. The Relativist side argues that language contextualizes thought and therefore perception, the idea being that having a different environment and culture causes the perception of the individual to be different.&lt;ref name="Unique hues and their stimuli"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4094">'''Valentin Feldman''' (23 June 1909 – 27 July 1942) was a [[French philosopher]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] of Jewish-Russian origin. In 1942, he was murdered by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Occupation of France]].

Born in [[Saint Petersburg]], he left the [[USSR]] in 1922 at the end of the Civil War. He settled in Paris and studied at the [[Lycée Henri IV]] and the [[Sorbonne]] University. A pupil of French philosopher [[Victor Basch]], he worked on [[aesthetics]] and wrote an essay, ''L'Esthétique française contemporaine'' (''French contemporan aesthetic''), Félix Alcan, 1936.

Involved in public activities as a teacher of philosophy, he supported as an antifascist the [[Front populaire]] and the [[Spanish Republic]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1937. Among his friends were [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Gaston Bachelard]] and [[Georges Politzer]]. In September 1939, he volunteered for the [[French Army]] despite suffering from a heart condition. Mobilized as a soldier in [[Rethel]], he began to write his ''Journal de guerre'' in January 1940 in the middle of the [[Phoney War]]. He survived several air attacks and bombardments during the [[Fall of France]] (May–June 1940).&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Feldman, ''Journal de guerre, 1940-1941'', Farrago, 2006, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[German Occupation]] he was a teacher in [[Dieppe]] but suffered from the first French [[Statute on Jews]] (October 1940). He was finally excluded from teaching in July 1941. By that time, he was already active in the [[French Resistance]]. From 1940, he was liaison officer between Dieppe, [[Rouen]] and [[Paris]]. After a year, he wrote the texts against the collaborationist [[Vichy regime]] and the Germans in the clandestine newspaper ''L'Avenir normand'' in Dieppe, and wrote several texts for the clandestine Parisian review ''[[La Pensée libre]]'', supervised by [[Georges Politzer]], [[Jacques Decour]] and [[Jacques Solomon]]. Becoming part of the underground, he joined a group of communist Resistance in Rouen, where he participated in actions against the German occupiers.

Arrested in February 1942 after the sabotage of a factory, he was imprisoned and tortured. Judged in Paris, he was condemned to death by a German military tribunal. He refused to sign his appeal for a reprieve. Feldman was executed by a firing squad on July 27, 1942. Addressing the German soldiers just before the salvo, he called out to them: "Imbeciles, it is for you that I die! "&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Feldman, ''Journal de guerre, 1940-1941'', Farrago, 2006, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

His last words inspired numerous French writers : [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Aragon]] were among them.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Cahiers pour une morale'', Gallimard, 1983, p. 212 ; Louis Aragon, ''L'Homme communiste'', Gallimard, 1946, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; French-Swiss film-maker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] dedicated a short film to him, ''The Last Word'' (1988).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4363">'''The Woodland School Of Art''', also named '''Woodlands style''', '''Woodlands School''', or '''Anishnabe painting''', is a genre of painting among [[First Nations]] and [[Native American art]]ists from the [[Great Lakes]] area - including northern [[Ontario]] and southwestern [[Manitoba]]. The majority of the Woodland artists belong to the [[Anishinaabe]]g - notably the [[Ojibwe]], [[Odawa people|Odawa]], and [[Potawatomi]], as well as the [[Oji-Cree]] and the [[Cree]]. The style is also known as '''Legend Painting''' or '''Medicine Painting'''.&lt;ref name=naa&gt;[http://www.native-american-artworld.com/aboriginal-art-norval-morrisseau.html "Norval Morrisseau."] ''Native American Artworld.'' (retrieved 25 Oct 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The style was founded by [[Norval Morrisseau]], a First Nations [[Ojibwe]] artist from Northern [[Ontario, Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips 229&lt;/ref&gt; He learned Ojibwe history and culture primarily from his grandfather Moses "Potan" Nanakonagos and in the 1950s collected traditional narratives from his tribe. This oral history has provided inspiration and subject matter for his paintings, and he drew upon dreams and visions.&lt;ref name=naa/&gt; Morrisseau said, "all my painting and drawing is really a continuation of the shaman's scrolls."&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips 230&lt;/ref&gt; Ojibwe [[Intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]], pictographs, petrographs [[rock art]] and [[birch bark scrolls]], [[Wiigwaasabak]], were stylistic antecedents of the Woodland style.

==Style==
This visionary style emphasizes outlines and x-ray views of people, animals, and plant life.&lt;ref name=naa/&gt; Colours are vivid, even garish. While Morrisseau painted on birch bark initially, the media of Woodland style tends to be western, such as acrylic, gouache, or watercolor paints on paper, wood panels, or canvas.
