==Summary==
On January 18, 1989, [[Baptist minister]] Don Piper was on his way home from a conference in [[Texas]] when a [[semi-trailer truck]] struck his [[Ford Taurus]] while crossing a bridge. Piper describes that he was crushed by the roof of his car, the steering wheel impaled his chest, and the dashboard collapsed on his legs. When [[paramedics]] arrived, they could not find any sign of life in Piper and covered him with a tarp as a fellow pastor prayed over him while waiting for the [[medical examiner]] to arrive.&lt;ref name="Inbar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/33055601|title=New study: What really happens when you die?|last=Inbar|first=Michael|date=2009-09-28|work=TODAY: Health|publisher=msnbc.com|accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Piper, he went straight to [[Heaven]] and experienced things he describes as amazing and beautiful, including meeting family members such as his great-grandmother and joining a Heavenly Choir that proceeded into the Gates of Heaven. Piper, an ordained minister since 1985, has recounted his narrative before 3,000 live audiences that included more than 1.5 million people altogether.&lt;ref name=cr/&gt; and appeared on numerous television and radio programs.&lt;ref name="Inbar"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2730">In [[literature]], '''action''' is the physical movement of the [[Character (arts)|character]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1999|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Action as a literary mode ==
"Action is the [[Mode (literature)|mode]] [that] [[fiction]] writers use to show what is happening at any given moment in the story," states [[Evan Marshall (agent)|Evan Marshall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation | Marshall | 1998 | p = 142}}&lt;/ref&gt; who identifies five fiction-writing modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation | Marshall | 1998 | pp = 143–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Page Morrell]] lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation | Morrell | 2006 | p = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description.

While [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]] is the element that brings a story and its characters to life on the page, and [[Narration|narrative]] gives the story its depth and substance, action creates the movement within a story. Writing a story means weaving all of the elements of fiction together.  When it is done right, weaving dialogue, narrative, and action can create a beautiful tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A scene top-heavy with action can feel unreal because it is likely that characters doing something—anything at all—would be talking during the activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alas Poor Yagan.jpg|thumbnail|right|350px|''Alas Poor Yagan'', from ''[[The West Australian]]'', Saturday 6 September 1997]]
'''''Alas Poor Yagan''''' is an [[editorial cartoon]], drawn by [[Dean Alston]] and published in ''[[The West Australian]]'' [[newspaper]] on 6 September 1997.  It consists of a panel of eight drawings of [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] [[activist]] [[Ken Colbung]] speaking to a group of three Indigenous Australian children.&lt;ref name="Alston 1997"&gt;[[Dean Alston|Alston, Dean]] (1997). "Alas, Poor Yagan".  ''[[The West Australian]]'', 6 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon's content offended many Indigenous Australians, and resulted in a complaint of racism to the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]].  The commission eventually ruled that the cartoon made inappropriate references to [[Nyungar]] beliefs but did not breach the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]].  This ruling was subsequently upheld on appeal to the [[Federal Court of Australia]].

==Background==
{{main|Yagan}}
''Alas Poor Yagan'' was published shortly after the return of [[Yagan]]'s head from the [[United Kingdom]]. Yagan was a Nyungar warrior who resisted the [[European ethnic groups|European]] settlement of [[Western Australia]]. He was shot dead by a settler in 1833, and his head was removed and sent to the United Kingdom for display in a [[museum]]. In 1964, it was buried in an unmarked grave in a local [[cemetery]]. The Nyungar community began efforts to locate and repatriate the head in 1990.  Yagan's head was finally [[Exhumation of Yagan's head|exhumed]] in September 1997, but organisation of the handover "was accompanied by a degree of sometimes undignified acrimony over who had the appropriate cultural claims, by descent, to bring the remains back".&lt;ref name="FCA 2004"&gt;Federal Court of Australia (2004). [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2004/16.html ''Bropho v Human Rights &amp; Equal Opportunity Commission &lt;nowiki&gt;[2004]&lt;/nowiki&gt; FCAFC 16'']. 6 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; These conflicts within the Nyungar community were publicly aired, and at one point even involved litigation in the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]].&lt;ref name="HREOC 2001"&gt;Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (2001). ''Corunna v West Australian Newspapers  (2001) EOC 93-146. 12 April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
''[[The West Australian]]'' provided coverage of the repatriation of Yagan's head, including the conflict within the Nyungar community. ''Alas Poor Yagan'' was published on 6 September 1997.  It was critical of the fact that the return of Yagan's head had become a source of conflict between Nyungars instead of fostering unity, and it lampooned the conduct of those involved in the conflict. It could also be interpreted as insulting aspects of Indigenous Australian culture, and casting aspersions on the motives and legitimacy of Indigenous Australians with mixed racial heritage.&lt;ref name="HREOC 2001"/&gt;

==Complaint==
On 24 September 1997, a complaint about the cartoon was lodged with the Race Discrimination Commissioner of the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]].  The complaint was made by human rights lawyer [[Hannah McGlade]] on behalf of a group of people calling themselves "The Nyungar Circle of Elders", and comprising Albert Corunna, Richard Wilkes, Violet Newman, Mingli Wanjurri, Leisha Eatts, [[Robert Bropho]] and [[Ken Colbung]].  The complainants alleged that Alston and ''The West Australian'' had breached "s18c of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975".&lt;ref name="HREOC 2001"/&gt;

On 4 March 1998, the Race Discrimination Commissioner discontinued her inquiry into the case on the grounds that the cartoon was "an artistic work" that was published "reasonably and in good faith", and was therefore exempt from the s18c conditions under s18d of the Act.  The Nyungar Circle of Elders rejected that finding, and asked for the case to be referred to the Commission for public inquiry.  A public hearing was held on 29 April 1999, and the findings released on 12 April 2001.  The Commission found that the cartoon was in breach of s18c of the Act; specifically, it found that the cartoon:
* contained a demeaning portrayal of Yagan;
* reinforced a negative [[stereotype]] regarding alcohol and Indigenous Australians;
* contained derogatory references to the [[Wagyl]], a [[religion|religious]] figure;
* treated [[death]] in a manner offensive to Indigenous Australians;
* provided intimate details of the ancestry of individuals, in some cases "where the intercourse was not a matter of choice for the Aboriginal women concerned";
* implied a diminishing of the race by the resultant racial mix; and
* reinforced a negative stereotype of Indigenous people taking advantage of government grants.
The Commission also found, however, that the cartoon was exempt under s18d of the Act, because it was done reasonably and in good faith.  The reasoning was based partly on the overall coverage of the issue by ''The West Australian'', which "provided a balance report... and an opinion which... encouraged unity in, and support of, the Aboriginal community".  In such a context, the decision by then [[editing|editor]] [[Paul Murray (journalist)|Paul Murray]] to publish the cartoon was found to be reasonable.&lt;ref name="HREOC 2001"/&gt;

[[Robert Bropho]] then sought a judicial review of the Commission's finding, but his application was dismissed on 4 December 2002.  Bropho then appealed against that decision in the [[Federal Court of Australia]].  On 6 February 2004, the Federal Court dismissed the appeal and ordered Bropho to pay all costs.&lt;ref name="FCA 2004"/&gt;

==Analysis==
According to McGlade, a number of academic commentators have expressed concern about the ruling, in particular that the protections offered under s18c were being undermined by a broad interpretation of the s18d exemption. McGlade has argued that "It is extremely difficult to reconcile the serious finding of breach under section18C with the subsequent finding of reasonableness under section 18D."&lt;ref name="McGlade 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Hannah | last = McGlade | year = 2001 | title = Race Vilification Before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission | journal = [[Indigenous Law Bulletin]] | volume = 5 | issue = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "obviously the adverse findings made of the Commission could have been relied upon to defeat the respondent's claim to have acted reasonably and in good faith. It appears that the complainants were placed under an impossible burden of proving explicit motive and intent.... [P]roper remedies are being denied by the responsible bodies."&lt;ref name="McGlade 2004"&gt;{{cite book | first = Hannah | last = McGlade | year = 2004 | title = Honour Among Nations?: Treaties and Agreements with Indigenous People | chapter = Race Discrimination in Australia: A Challenge for Treaty Settlement | pages = 273–287 | publisher = Melbourne University Publishing | isbn = 0-522-85106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar point is made by Anna Chapman, who argues that "the result of the case was a reification of dominant racial values... in prioritising non-indigenous racial narratives over Indigenous perspectives."&lt;ref name="Chapman 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Anna | last = Chapman | title = Australian Racial Hatred Law: Some Comments on Reasonableness and Adjudicative Method in Complaints Brought by Indigenous People | year = 2004 | journal = Monash University Law Review | volume = 30 | pages = 27–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Manifest I of De Stijl.JPG|thumb|300 px|[[De Stijl]] manifesto, 1918]]
An '''art manifesto''' is a public declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of an artist or artistic movement. [[Manifesto]]s are a standard feature of the various movements in the [[modernist]] avant-garde and are still written today. Art manifestos are sometimes in their rhetoric intended for shock value, to achieve a revolutionary effect. They often address wider issues, such as the political system. Typical themes are the need for revolution, freedom (of expression) and the implied or overtly stated superiority of the writers over the status quo.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The manifesto gives a means of expressing, publicising and recording ideas for the artist or art group—even if only one or two people write the words, it is mostly still attributed to the group name.

In 1855 [[Gustave Courbet]] wrote a Realist manifesto for the introduction to the catalogue of his independent, personal exhibition. And in 1886 the [[Symbolist Manifesto]] was published in the French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' by the poet and essayist [[Jean Moréas]].

The first art manifesto of the 20th century was introduced with the [[futurism (art)|Futurists]] in Italy in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7894877.stm |title=Back to the Futurists |first=Lawrence |last=Pollard |newspaper=News.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[Cubism|Cubists]], [[Vorticism|Vorticists]], [[Dada]]ists and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]: the period up to World War II created what are still the best known manifestos. Although they never stopped being issued, other media such as the growth of broadcasting tended to sideline such declarations. Due to the internet there has been a resurgence of the form, and many new manifestos are now appearing to a potential worldwide audience. The [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] have made particular use of this to start a worldwide movement of affiliated groups.

Manifestos typically consist of a number of statements, which are numbered or in bullet points and which do not necessarily follow logically from one to the next. [[Tristan Tzara]]'s explanation of the manifesto (''Feeble Love &amp; Bitter Love, II'') captures the spirit of many:
{{cquote|A manifesto is a communication made to the whole world, whose only pretension is to the discovery of an instant cure for political, astronomical, artistic, parliamentary, agronomical and literary syphilis. It may be pleasant, and good-natured, it's always right, it's strong, vigorous and logical. Apropos of logic, I consider myself very likeable.}}

==Concept==
Before the early 20th century, the manifesto was almost exclusively a declaration with political aims. The intention of artists adopting the form, therefore, is to indicate that they are employing art as a political tool.

The art manifesto has two main goals. The first is to define and criticize a paradigm in contemporary art or culture; the second is to define a set of aesthetic values to counter this paradigm. Often, manifestos aspire to be works of art in their own right; for instance, many manifesto writers intend for their texts to be performed. Other manifestos cannot be fully appreciated simply as written statements because they rely heavily on graphic design for communication, a common feature in Dada manifestos. Several artists have written manifestos about artistic mediums not their own.

Historically, there has been a strong parallel between the art manifesto and the political manifesto. It was not uncommon for manifesto writers of the early 20th century to also be politically active. In Italy, Futurist founder Filippo Tomasso Marinetti ran for office, and both Russian and Italian Futurists issued political manifestos. In England, Vorticist Wyndham Lewis supported the Suffragettes, while in France, Surrealist André Breton supported the Communist party. Often however, these political organizations rejected the artists’ attention; in other cases, artists were censored and persecuted by European authoritarian governments, like Fascist Italy and Communist Russia, which institutionally rejected the avant-garde.

==Pre-1900==

===Realist Manifesto 1855===
[[Gustave Courbet]] wrote a Realist manifesto for the introduction to the catalogue of his independent, personal exhibition, 1855, echoing the tone of the period's political manifestos. In it he asserts his goal as an artist "to translate the customs, the ideas, the appearance of my epoch according to my own estimation."&lt;ref name="Realist Manifesto"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm The Metropolitan Museum of Art, ''Nineteenth–Century French Realism'', Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027081619/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |date=October 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orsay"&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/courbet-dossier/courbet-speaks.html Musée d'Orsay, Courbet speaks, ''Exhibition and sale of forty paintings and four drawings by Gustave Courbet, Paris 1855''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801012842/http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/courbet-dossier/courbet-speaks.html |date=August 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolist Manifesto 1886===
In 1886 the [[Symbolist Manifesto]] was published in the French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' by the poet and essayist [[Jean Moréas]]. It defined and characterized [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] as a style whose "goal was not the ideal, but whose sole purpose was to express itself for the sake of being expressed." It names [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], and [[Paul Verlaine]] as the three leading poets of the movement.&lt;ref name="Symbolist Manifesto"&gt;[[Edward Lucie-Smith|Lucie-Smith, Edward.]] (1972) ''Symbolist Art''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 54. {{ISBN|0500201250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seminal 1909–45==

===Futurist Manifesto 1909, 1914===
{{main article|Futurist Manifesto}}
The Futurist Manifesto, written by the [[Italy|Italian]] poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], was published in the Italian newspaper ''Gazzetta dell'Emilia'' in [[Bologna]] on February 5, 1909, then in French as ''Manifeste du futurisme'' in the newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' on February 20, 1909. It initiated an artistic [[philosophy]], [[Futurism]], that was a rejection of the past, and a celebration of speed, machinery, violence, youth and industry; it  was also an advocation of the modernization and cultural rejuvenation of [[Italy]].

Since the founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme, the Futurists attempted to create one in their subsequent ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting'' (1914).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/imanifestidelfut00mariuoft|title=I Manifesti del futurismo, lanciati da Marinetti [et al.]|first=Filippo Tommaso|last=Marinetti|publisher=[Firenze Lacerba]|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; This committed them to a "universal dynamism", which was to be directly represented in painting and sculpture. Objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings: "The sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one, ten four three; they are motionless and they change places... The motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes, and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it."&lt;ref name=Tech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/techpaint.html |title=Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting |publisher=Unknown.nu |date= |accessdate=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cubist Manifesto 1912===
{{main article|Du "Cubisme"}}
[[File:Du "Cubisme", 1912, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Eugène Figuière Editeurs (cover).jpg|thumb|Du "Cubisme", 1912, [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Jean Metzinger]], published by [[:fr:Eugène Figuière|Eugène Figuière Éditeurs]] (cover)]]
Du "Cubisme", written in 1912 by [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Jean Metzinger]], was the first major theoretical text on [[Cubism]]. The book was illustrated with works by Gleizes, Metzinger, [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]] and [[Marie Laurencin]]. In this highly influential treatise Gleizes and Metzinger explicitly related the concept of 'multiple perspective' to the [[Henri Bergson|Bergsonian]] sense of time. The faceted treatment of physical objects and space blurred the distinctions between subject and abstraction, between representation and non-objectivity. Effects of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] were used to convey a [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] sense of fluidity of consciousness.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544#skipToContent Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702090838/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544#skipToContent |date=July 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Du "Cubisme"]] introduced the concept of 'simultaneity' into the theoretical framework of Cubism. It was in part a concept born out of a conviction based on the authors understanding of [[Henri Poincaré]] and Bergson that the separation or distinction between space and time should be comprehensively challenged. It was based both on philosophical and scientific ideas, on [[Riemannian geometry]] and the [[Relativism|relativity of knowledge]], contradicting notions of [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. These ideas were disseminated and debated in the widely available publication, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of [[modernism]].&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;[http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Concrete Manifesto 1959===
Neo-Concrete Manifesto, by [[Ferreira Gullar]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coleccioncisneros.org/st_writ.asp?ID=10&amp;Type=2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050420213302/http://www.coleccioncisneros.org/st_writ.asp?ID=10&amp;Type=2 |date=April 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; begins:
:We use the term "neo-concrete" to differentiate ourselves from those committed to non-figurative "geometric" art (neo-plasticism, constructivism, suprematism, the school of Ulm) and particularly the kind of concrete art that is influenced by a dangerously acute rationalism. In the light of their artistic experience, the painters, sculptors, engravers and writers participating in this first Neo-concrete Exhibition came to the conclusion that it was necessary to evaluate the theoretical principles on which concrete art has been founded, none of which offers a rationale for the expressive potential they feel their art contains."

===Manifesto of Industrial Painting 1959===
"Manifesto of Industrial Painting: For a unitary applied art", written by [[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/gallizio.html |title=Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio |publisher=Notbored.org |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in August 1959, was originally published in Italian in ''Notizie Arti Figurative'' No. 9 (1959). Shortly afterwards it was published in ''Internationale Situationniste no.3'' in a French translation. It was translated into English in 1997 by Molly Klein. It has only 70 points and is written a grand utopian rhetorical manner, with statements such as, "A new, ravenous force of domination will push men toward an unimaginable epic poetry." One of its themes is the reconciliation of industry and nature:
:The return to nature with modern instrumentation will allow man, after thousands of centuries, to return to the places where Paleolithic hunters overcame great fear; modern man will seek to abandon his own, accumulated in the idiocy of progress, on contact with humble things, which nature in her wisdom has conserved as a check on the immense arrogance of the human mind.

==Counterculture 1960–75==
Manifestos in the 1960s reflected the changing social and political attitudes of the times: the general ferment of "[[counterculture]]" revolution to overthrow the existing order and the particular rise of [[feminism]] and [[Black Power]], as well as the pioneering of new art forms such as [[body art]] and [[performance art]].

===Situationist Manifesto 1960===
The [[Situationist International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/manifesto.html |title=Situationist International Online |publisher=Cddc.vt.edu |date=May 17, 1960 |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded at Cosio d’Arroscia April 27, 1957 by eight members, who wanted a revolutionary art with a state of constant transformation, and hence newness, as well as abolishing the gap between art and life. The manifesto espousing this was issued May 17, 1960 and reprinted in ''Internationale Situationniste'' number 4 in June 1960. It advocated the "new human force" against technology and the "dissatisfaction of its possible uses in our senseless social life", stating "We will inaugurate what will historically be the last of the crafts. The role of amateur-professional situationist—of anti-specialist—is again a specialization up to the point of economic and mental abundance, when everyone becomes an 'artist'". Its final sentence is: "Such are our goals, and these will be the future goals of humanity."

It begins with the prompts for the later statements in the manifesto, the first line being, "Due to the fact that I have painted monochromes for fifteen years". It is a meditation by the artist about his work and life:
:An artist always feels uneasy when called upon to speak of his own work. It should speak for itself, particularly when it is valid.
:What can I do? Stop now?
:No, what I call "the indefinable pictorial sensibility" absolutely escapes this very personal solution.
:So...
He [[Appropriation (art)|appropriates]] the sky:
:Once, in 1946, while still an adolescent, I was to sign my name on the other side of the sky during a fantastic "realistico-imaginary" journey. That day, as I lay stretched upon the beach of Nice, I began to feel hatred for birds which flew back and forth across my blue, cloudless sky, because they tried to bore holes in my greatest and most beautiful work.
:Birds must be eliminated.
He ends with an affirmation that he is "ready to dive into the void".

===I Am For An Art... Manifesto, 1961===
[[Claes Oldenburg]], a Pop artist, reacting against [[Abstract Expressionism]], along with other young artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oldenburg|first=Claes|title=Claes Oldenburg: I am for an Art|url=http://artiststatements.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/claes-oldenburg-i-am-for-an-art/|work=Artist Statements|accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifesto ‘I am for an Art’ was originally made to be included in the catalogue of the 'Environments, Situations and Spaces’ exhibition. Each of the statements begin with 'I am for an art...'.

The following quote is from the first two statement in his poetical manifesto:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;"I am for an art that is political-erotical-mystical, that does something other than sit on its ass in a museum.&lt;br /&gt;I am for an art that grows up not knowing it is art at all, an art given the chance of having a starting

It is written in lower case, with upper case for certain key phrases, some underlined. Its first paragraph is:
:Purge the world of bourgeois sickness, "intellectual", professional and commercialized culture, purge the world of dead art, imitation, artificial art, abstract art, illusionistic art, mathematical art, — purge the world of "Europanism"!
It advocates revolution, "living art, anti-art" and "non art reality to be grasped by all peoples, not only critics, dilettantes and professionals."

===[[SCUM Manifesto]] 1967===
SCUM, by [[Valerie Solanas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Solanas|first=Valerie|title=The SCUM Manifesto|url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/rants/scum.html|publisher=Northeastern University|accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an acronym for the "Society for Cutting up Men" and the manifesto was not specifically about art. However, it has become part of art history, because it was published in 1968, the same year that Solanas, who had spent time in [[Andy Warhol]]'s "Factory", shot and nearly killed him. It also has sections that address art ideas. Solanas spent her last years as a street prostitute and died in 1988.

It is a document of just over 11,000 words. Its tone and basic theme are evident from the title, but it is not quite as clear cut as it seems and some women are admitted to be as bad as men (women artists, for example). SCUM wants to "destroy all useless and harmful objects — cars, store windows, "Great Art", etc." In a section on "'Great Art' and 'Culture'" it states:
:The male 'artist' attempts to solve his dilemma of not being able to live, of not being female, by constructing a highly artificial world in which the male is heroized, that is, displays female traits, and the female is reduced to highly limited, insipid subordinate roles, that is, to being male.
:The male 'artistic' aim being, not to communicate (having nothing inside him he has nothing to say), but to disguise his animalism, he resorts to symbolism and obscurity ('deep' stuff). The vast majority of people, particularly the 'educated' ones, lacking faith in their own judgment, humble, respectful of authority ('Daddy knows best'), are easily conned into believing that obscurity, evasiveness, incomprehensibility, indirectness, ambiguity and boredom are marks of depth and brilliance ...
:Absorbing 'culture' is a desperate, frantic attempt to groove in an ungroovy world, to escape the horror of a sterile, mindless, existence. `Culture' provides a sop to the egos of the incompetent, a means of rationalizing passive spectating; they can pride themselves on their ability to appreciate the `finer' things, to see a jewel where this is only a turd (they want to be admired for admiring).

===Maintenance Art Manifesto 1969===
The full title of the manifesto is "Maintenance Art—Proposal for an Exhibition"; it is considered a seminal document of feminist art. [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]] was pregnant at the time, and decided to reinterpret household chores by becoming a "maintenance artist", where she would "perform" them. Through this such "maintenance" revealed itself as an important condition for freedom and social functioning and she extended the idea beyond feminism to projects like the 11 month ''Touch Sanitation'', involving 8,500 New York workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archivefiles/2002/09/touch_sanitatio.php |title=Touch Sanitation |first=Robert C. |last=Morgan |publisher=Communityarts.net |accessdate=April 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308031259/http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archivefiles/2002/09/touch_sanitatio.php |archivedate=March 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently she has addressed a landfill site on [[Staten Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.jewishculture.org/visual_arts_articles/publications_jcn_sp02_landfill.html |title=Learning from Landfill |first=Daniel |last=Belasco |work=Jewish Culture News |date=Spring 2001 |accessdate=April 7, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030220154152/http://www.jewishculture.org/visual_arts_articles/publications_jcn_sp02_landfill.html |archivedate=February 20, 2003 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifesto was followed by a questionnaire (1973–76) and was concerned with making art of what would normally be seen as routine, mundane chores. She wrote, "After the revolution, who is going to pick up the garbage on Monday morning?". She followed this up with a "Sanitation Manifesto!" (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.schroederromero.com/press/nyt1002.html |title=Power and Glory in Sisterhood |first=Edward M. |last=Gomez |work=New York Times |date=October 13, 2002 |accessdate=April 7, 2006 |publisher=schroederromero.com }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maintenance Manifesto stated:

:Maintenance is a drag; it takes all the fucking time (lit.) The mind boggles and chafes at the boredom. The culture confers lousy status on maintenance jobs--minimum wages, housewives — no pay. Clean your desk, wash the dishes, clean the floor, wash your clothes, wash your toes, change the baby's diaper, finish the report, correct the typos, mend the fence, keep the customer happy, throw out the stinking garbage, watch out don't put things in your nose, what shall I wear, I have no sox, pay your bills, don't litter, save string, wash your hair, change the sheets, go to the store, I'm out of perfume, say it again — he doesn't understand, seal it again — it leaks, go to work, this art is dusty, clear the table, call him again, flush the toilet, stay young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artgroove.com/quotes1.shtml |title=Quotes from Maintenance Art Manifesto |publisher=artgroove.com |date=April 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426171609/http://www.artgroove.com/quotes1.shtml |archivedate=April 26, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AfriCobra Manifesto 1970===
Afri-Cobra was a black artist collective founded in the late 1960s by [[Jeff Donaldson (artist)|Jeff Donaldson]] and based in Chicago. He helped organise international shows of black artists and wrote influential manifestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/a/african_american_7.html |title=African American Art |publisher=artlex.com |accessdate=April 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326174351/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/a/african_american_7.html |archivedate=March 26, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; AfriCobra is an acronym for "African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists". This was derived from combining the term for Africa with "Cobra", the "Coalition of Black Revolutionary Artists". The manifesto stated the groups objectives to be the development of a new African American art, involving social responsibility, community artistic involvement and promotion of pride in Black identity. There were parallels with African American musical innovations, and the advocacy of a complementary aesthetic involving sublime imagery and high-key colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asrc.cornell.edu/blacknessincolor/galleries/galllery7left.html |title=Movements, Groups and Kindred Spirits |publisher= Asrc.cornell.edu |accessdate=April 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WAR Manifestos early 1970s===
WAR is an acronym for "Women Artists in Revolution" of which [[Nancy Spero]] was a member. Prior to this in 1966–70 she had created a series of anti-[[Vietnam War]] "manifestos" which were images created with water paints and inks on paper. She then attended AWC (Art Workers Coalition) meetings, which had men and women members, and became part of WAR, which was an offshoot. She said, "I loved it. I was so angry at that time about so many things, especially about not being able to get my art out, to get people to look. I thought, "WAR"— that's it. We started to organize some actions and protests and wrote manifestos. For example, a few of us marched into the Museum of Modern Art and demanded equality for women artists. Then, I joined another, the Ad Hoc Committee of Women Artists. It all went very fast in those days."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebrooklynrail.org/arts/nov03/spero.html The Brooklyn rail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050219030742/http://www.thebrooklynrail.org/arts/nov03/spero.html |date=February 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

vengeance the future of women's art" and "made important theoretical contributions to communicating a personal feminism in performance. She felt that it was important politically to create art. 'I knew that if I did it naked, I would really change how the

The French [[Sociological art]] Collective was founded by [[Fred Forest]], [[Jean-Paul Thénot]] and [[Hervé Fischer]] and had their manifesto published in the newspaper [[Le Monde]].  Its main purpose was using sociology to underpin artistic actions, or using artistic actions to elucidate sociological phenomena.  One such action was the auctioning of a "artistic square meter" in 1976 to spoof the inflation of prices in the housing and art markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webnetmuseum.org/html/en/expo-retr-fredforest/actions/20_en.htm#text |title=Web Net Museum-Fred forest-Retrospective-Sociologic art-Aesthetic of communication-Artworks-Actions-The artistic square meter |publisher=Webnetmuseum.org |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collective made heavy use of mass media and live performance using video, telephones, etc.  The group was dissolved in 1981, though some of its tenets were brought by [[Fred Forest]] and [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] with the [[Communication aesthetics]] movement of 1983.&lt;ref name=crono/&gt;

===Body Art Manifesto 1975===
In 1975 [[François Pluchart]] promoted the first [[Body Art]] show at the [[Galerie Stadler]] in Paris, with work from 21 artists, including [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Chris Burden]] and [[Katharina Sieverding]]. The first Body Art manifesto was published.&lt;ref name=crono/&gt;

=== A Manifesto on Lyrical Conceptualism  1975===
by [[Paul Hartal]]

This is a four-page document illustrated with nine black and white images of the artist's paintings, collages and multimedia, published in Montreal in 1975.
"My art is a painted metaphor; the past machine of a perpetual second, the fossil emotion of an infinite longing, the magic desire evolving on the broken axis of the compressed space, reflected in the form of inner, personal landscapes", writes Hartal in the manifesto. "Art ought to be total", he suggests. "The biotic separated from the geometrical is arbitrary, and ignores the human nature." The idea of  "Lyrical Conceptualism is based on the wholeness of the psychological coordinate", he says. It "derives from the id, ego and superego"; an "art in which the primarily twofold character of the artist's view evolves into a lyrical, intuitive and conceptual triad". In The Brush and the Compass: The Interface Dynamics of Art and Science (Lanham: University Press of America, 1988, 341 pp), Hartal discusses in more detail the theory of ''Lyrical Conceptualism'' or ''Lyco art'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federationofpoets.com/featurepaulhartal.htm |title=Canadian Federation of Poets Member Feature |publisher=Federationofpoets.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthbys.com/Paul_Hartal.htm |title=Paul Hartal: Love and Cosmos, Lyrical Conceptualism, Contemporary Paintings, Works on Paper |publisher=Arthbys.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicboard.com |title=publicboard.com |publisher=publicboard.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Online |first=Saatchi |url=http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/yourgallery/artist_profile//11739.html |title=Sell Artwork, Buy Original Paintings, Art Prints, Discover New Artists &amp;#124; Saatchi Online |publisher=Saatchi-gallery.co.uk |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monkdogz.com/literature.htm |title=Monkdogz Urban Art/ |publisher=Monkdogz.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206002338/http://www.monkdogz.com/literature.htm |archivedate=February 6, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arteutile.net/Hartal/Hartal.htm |title=Hartal |publisher=Arteutile.net |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punk and cyber 1976–1998==
The rise of the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement with its basic and aggressive DIY attitude had a significant input into art manifestos, and this is reflected even in the titles. Some of the artists overtly identified with punk through music, publishing or poetry performance. There is also an equivalent "shocking" interpretation of feminism which contradicts the non-objectification advocated in the 1960s. Then the growing presence of the computer age began to assert itself in art proclamations as in society.

===Crude Art Manifesto 1978===
Artist [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] promoted the Crude Art Manifesto 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuckism.com/Manifestos/CrudeArtManifesto.html |title=Stuckism |publisher=Stuckism |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was posted in [[Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design|Maidstone Art College]] by Charles Thomson, then a student at the college. 21 years later he co-wrote the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] manifestos with [[Billy Childish]]. Thomson was also a member of the punk-based [[The Medway Poets]]. The manifesto rejects "department store" art and "elitist" gallery art, as well as sophistication and skill which are "easily obtainable ... and are used both industrially and artistically to conceal a poverty of content." The priority is stated to be "the exploration and expression of the human spirit".

===Smile Manifestos 1982===
by [[Stewart Home]]

At this time Stewart Home operated as a one-person movement "Generation Positive", founding a punk band called White Colours and publishing an art fanzine ''Smile'', which mostly contained art manifestos for the "Generation Positive". The rhetoric of these resembled the 1920s Berlin Dadaist manifestos. His idea was that other bands round the world should also call themselves White Colours and other magazines be titled ''Smile''. The first part of the book ''Neoist Manifestos/The Art Strike Papers'' featured abriged versions of his manifesto-style writings from ''Smile''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stewart Home|"Stewart Home", Wikipedia]] Retrieved April 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Association of Astronomical Artists Manifesto 1982===
The basic tenet of the IAAA is the depiction of space (as in the cosmos) through realist painting. They disassociate themselves from science fiction and fantasy artists: "a firm foundation of knowledge and research is the basis for each painting. Striving to accurately depict scenes which are at present beyond the range of human eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://iaaa.org/manifesto.html | title=The IAAA Manifesto | work=International Association of Astronomical Artists | accessdate=September 15, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921183906/http://iaaa.org/manifesto.html | archive-date=September 21, 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group now has over 120 members representing 20 countries.

The whole title is "the Why Cheap Art? manifesto". It is a single sheet, issued by the Bread and Puppet Theater "in direct response to the business of art and its growing appropriation by the corporate sector." There are seventeen statements, most of them beginning "Art is" and ending with an exclamation mark, set out mostly in upper case, sometimes mixed in with lower case, in different typefaces which get bolder through the leaflet till the final statement of a large HURRAH. It starts:
:People have been thinking too long that art is a privilege of the museums &amp; the rich.
:Art is not business!
It stresses the positive nature of art which is beneficial to all and should be available to all, using poetic images such as "Art is like green trees", and urging, "Art fights against war &amp; stupidity! ... Art is cheap!

===A Cyborg Manifesto 1985===

This has the full title of "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth-Century." Donna Haraway is a cultural historian. She advocates the development of cyborgs ("cybernetic organisms") as the way forward for a post-gender society. This had a significant effect initially amongst academics. VNS Matrix, a group of Australian women artists and British cultural historian, [[Sadie Plant]], established a cyberfeminist movement in 1994. From 1997, the Old Boys Network (OBN) has organised "Cyberfeminist Internationals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/themes/overview_of_media_art/society/scroll/ |title=Social Technologies: Deconstruction, subversion and the utopia of democratic communication |first= Inke |last=Arns |date=April 7, 2006 |publisher=Medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===What our art means 1986===

The manifesto is five paragraphs, each with a subtitle, the first of which is "Art for All", summing up the popularist intent of their manifesto:
:We want Our Art to speak across the barriers of knowledge directly to People about their Life and not about their knowledge of art. The twentieth century has been cursed with an art that cannot be understood. The decadent artists stand for themselves and their chosen few, laughing at and dismissing the normal outsider. We say that puzzling, obscure and form-obsessed art is decadent and a cruel denial of the Life of People.
There is also an intent to change people, but "The art-material must be subservient to the meaning and purpose of the picture." It states:
:We want to learn to respect and honour "the whole". The content of mankind is our subject and our inspiration. We stand each day for good traditions and necessary changes. We want to find and accept all the good and bad in ourselves.
The conclusion is an affirmation of "our life-search for new meanings and purpose to give to life."

The manifesto was signed by [[Veronica Vera]] and [[Candida Royalle]] (both ex porn stars who had then directed their own porn movies), [[Annie Sprinkle]] (who gives explicit sexual one woman shows) and performance artist [[Frank Moore (performance artist)|Frank Moore]], among other significant artists  who use sex in their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ikonenmagazin.de/interview/Ovidie.htm |title=Beyond the Porno Manifesto |first=Martin |last=Kreischer |date=January 2005 |accessdate=April 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 7 short points, it founds an art movement, which "celebrates sex as the nourishing, life-giving force. We embrace our genitals as part, not separate, from our spirits." It  advocates the "attitude of sex-positivism" and wishes to "communicate our ideas and emotions ... to have fun, heal the world and endure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drsusanblock.com/editorial/moore/postporn.htm |title=Post Porn, Post Sex, A New Art Movement |first=Frank |last=Moore |date=1989–1993 |accessdate=April 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VNS Matrix was a cyberfeminist art collective founded in Adelaide, Australia, in 1991. Their manifesto, written in 1991, was translated over the years into many languages including Italian, French, Spanish, Russian, Japanese and Finnish. It begins:
:we are the modern cunt
:positive anti reason
:unbounded unleashed unforgiving
:we see art with our cunt we make art with our cunt
In 1996 they wrote the Bitch Mutant Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/meme/symp/contrib/vns.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303104255/http://www.aec.at/meme/symp/contrib/vns.html |date=March 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ____________ Manifesto proposed an interactive, fill-in-the-blanks view of prohibitions and claims to be made about art and art movements. It was an early interactive piece of net art that appeared in webzines and in newsgroups, inviting participation. It begins:
:Today, ____________ itself is obsolete.
The manifesto ends with a ''Reset'' button. The text is sampled from Tristian Tzara's Dada manifestos, but key pieces from the original text have been omitted and replaced with blanks to be filled-in.

It is one of the earliest manifestos to be published on the Internet as well as in print.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Taylor. ''The Literature of Society Series: The Manifesto in Literature, vol. 3,'' St James Press, New York, 2013, pp. 84-87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group Hangman 1997===

Group Hangman was started by [[Billy Childish]], [[Tracey Emin]] and two others in [[Medway]], [[Kent]] in 1983 for a short time. Fourteen years later it reformed with more members (nearly all of whom later joined the Stuckists art group), but without Emin. At this point Childish wrote 6 short manifestos, each containing 7 – 12 statements. He says, "they were anarchic and contradictory - my favourite!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trakmarx.com/2004_02/10_billy.htm |title=Billy Childish interview |publisher= Trakmarx.com |accessdate= April 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ideas resurfaced in the Stuckist manifestos written two years later. Point 9 of ''Communication 0001'' states:
:Western art has been stupefying its audience into taking the position of an admiring doormat. We, at Group Hangman however, intend to wipe our mud-encrusted boots on the face of conceptual balderdash.
Style must be smashed ("Artistic talent is the only obstacle") and the unacceptable must be embraced. The last communication, of only two short sentences, was written in 2000 and recommends, "It is time for art to grow up."

=== Extropic Art Manifesto 1997 ===

(A genre of the [[Transhumanist art]] movement whose manifesto was written in 1982)

This was written on January 1, 1997, and was apparently "on board the [[Cassini Huygens]] spacecraft on its mission to Saturn." Following the statement "We are transhumans", there is the explanation, "Transhumanist Art reflects an extropic appreciation of aesthetics in a technologically enhanced world." After the manifesto is a "FAQ", which states, "Transhumanist Arts include creative works by scientists, engineers, technicians, philosophers, athletes, educators, mathematicians, etc., who may not be artists in the traditional sense, but whose vision and creativity are integral to transhumanity." The Manifesto is based on a ''Transhumanist Art Statement'' written in 1982. Cited as specific influences are "Abstract Art, Performance Art, Kinetic Art, Cubism, Techno Art, science fiction and Communications Art." Some collaborators of Vita-More's are named as [[Timothy Leary]], [[Bill Viola]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]].

==World wide web 1999–present==
Widespread access to the internet has created a new incentive for artists to publish manifestos, with the knowledge that there is an instant potential worldwide audience. The effect of the internet on art manifestos has been described: "One could almost say we are living through a new boom time for the manifesto. The Web allows almost anybody to nail a broadsheet to the virtual wall for all to see."&lt;ref name=manifestodestiny&gt;{{cite web |last=Reynolds |first=Simon  |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/books/0120,reynolds,24748,10.html |title=Manifesto destiny |publisher=Villagevoice.com |date= May 15–22, 2001 |accessdate= August 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the manifestos also appear in print form; others only exist as virtual text. It has also led to a great diversity of approaches, as well as a noticeable trend looking back at earlier traditions of Modernism or the Renaissance to create a present and future paradigm. The Stuckists manifesto has become well known, though most others have achieved little individual reputation or impact.

The 4th point states, "Artists who don't paint aren't artists"; the 5th is, "Art that has to be in a gallery to be art isn’t art." Points are made against [[conceptual art]], [[Young British Artists|Britart]], [[Charles Saatchi]], art gimmicks and white wall galleries, while the amateur is hailed. The final point is:
:Stuckism embraces all that it denounces. We only denounce that which stops at the starting point — Stuckism starts at the stopping point!
This manifesto is available on their web site in 7 languages. They have issued at least 8 other manifestos, including the [[Remodernism|Remodernist]] Manifesto (2000), which inaugurates "a new spirituality in art" (to replace [[Postmodernism]]'s "scientific materialism, nihilism and spiritual bankruptcy"), the [[Turner Prize]] Manifesto, handed out in their [[Stuckist demonstrations|demonstrations]] at [[Tate Britain]] and a Critique of Damien Hirst.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/H/hirst/against.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503150414/http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/H/hirst/against.html |date=May 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tate]] gallery holds three of the manifestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archive.tate.org.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqServer=tb-calm&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=((text)='stuckists') |work=Tate archive catalogue |title=Stuckists |publisher= Archive.tate.org.uk |accessdate=July 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spin-offs by other Stuckists include a [[Camberwell College of Arts]] Students for Stuckism manifesto (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuckism.com/manifest_Student.html |title=Sensational? |publisher=Stuckism |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a teenagers' Underage Stuckists Manifesto (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuckism.com/Manifestos/UnderageStuckists.html |title=Stuckism |publisher=Stuckism |date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Allen Herndon]] published ''The Manifesto of the American Stuckists'', whose content was challenged by the Los Angeles Stuckists group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=La-stuckism.com |url=http://www.la-stuckism.com/blog/2006/12/against-national-chauvinism-in-art.html |title=Against national chauvinism in art |location= Stuck in L.A. |date=December 17, 2006 |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been an anti-Stuckist manifesto published in 2005 by the London Surrealist Group.

===Versatilist Manifesto 2007===
by [[Denis Mandarino]]&lt;ref name=USP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://br.monografias.com/trabalhos-pdf/reflexoes-manifesto-versatilista-artista-consciencia/reflexoes-manifesto-versatilista-artista-consciencia.shtml|author=Luko, C. S.|year=2011|title=Reflections on the versatilist manifesto|publisher=[[University of São Paulo|USP]]|accessdate=August 25, 2012|language=pt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Versatilist Manifesto]] was written by [[Brazil]]ian composer, artist and writer, [[Denis Mandarino]], with the intention of freeing people from the expert analysis and promote the practice of art as a form of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] and spiritual enhancement, in [[São Paulo]] in July 2007. In Versatilism, there are no art contests, as no man or group is capable of judging other men. An art critic always analyses a situation from a profoundly limited point of view because his knowledge is also limited. Contests and prizes can be a way of directing public opinion and on doing so, valorizing this or that artist that aims financial or social advantages. Nevertheless, [[cultural|ethical cultural]] initiatives are praiseworthy.

===The Remodernist Film Manifesto 2008===
by [[Jesse Richards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jesse-richards.blogspot.com/2008/08/remodernist-film-manifesto.html |title=Waarschuwing over inhoud |publisher=Jesse-richards.blogspot.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A manifesto on filmmaking written by former [[Stuckist]] painter, photographer and filmmaker Jesse Richards that like the closely related [[Remodernism]] manifesto, calls for a "new spirituality", but in this instance, in relation to cinema. The manifesto proclaims a spiritual film to be "not about religion. It is cinema concerned with humanity and an understanding of the simple truths and moments of humanity. Spiritual film is really ALL about these moments". Point 4 of the manifesto discusses [[Japan]]ese aesthetics in relation to the idea of [[Remodernist film]]: "The Japanese ideas of [[wabi-sabi]] (the beauty of imperfection) and [[mono no aware]] (the awareness of the transience of things and the bittersweet feelings that accompany their passing), have the ability to show the truth of existence, and should always be considered when making the remodernist film". The manifesto also criticizes filmmakers that shoot on video, arguing that film, particularly Super-8 film "has a rawness, and an ability to capture the poetic essence of life, that video has never been able to accomplish" and also criticizes [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s work, as being "dishonest and boring", as well as [[Dogme 95]]'s "pretentious checkist" of rules. Instead, the Remodernist film philosophy seems to be somewhat anti-ego, with Richards noting that "this manifesto should be viewed only as a collection of ideas and hints whose author may be mocked and insulted at will". The manifesto was recently translated into Turkish and published by the film website Bakiniz, and is being translated into Polish and published by the Polish underground art and culture magazine, RED.

===The Superstroke Art Movement Manifesto 2008===
by [[Conrad Bo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Superstroke Art Movement |url=http://superstrokeartmovement.blogspot.com/ |title=Superstroke Art |publisher=Superstrokeartmovement.blogspot.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This manifesto was written by the South African conceptual artist [[Conrad Bo]], who believes the [[Superstroke]] Art Movement is the first internationally known art movement in Africa since the [[Fook Island]] art movement started by [[Walter Battiss]]. The manifesto is quite specific in what the [[Superstroke]] Art Movement want to achieve. [[Superstroke]] is short for the super expressive brush stroke.
The Manifesto for the [[Superstroke]] Art Movement written by Conrad Bo is as follows: 1.Paintings should be executed using expressive even violent brush strokes on at least some part of the picture. 2.Should a photograph be used for a figurative painting, the objection should not be Photorealism, but Expressionism. 3.If mediums such as pen, pencil, etc. are used, the pen and pencil strokes must at least be overly expressive for it to be considered a Superstroke picture. 4.Paintings can be executed in both the abstract and figurative. 5.Subject matters such as Africa, light, dark, life and death are encouraged. 6.Collage, Stencil and Calligraphy may be used for impact. 7.The concept, Art for the sake of art, does not apply in Superstroke. In Superstroke it is art for the sake of Superstroke, as the artist must always strive for paintings rich in texture, or excessive brush or pencil strokes.

===The Metamodernist Manifesto (2011)===

''[[Metamodernism#The_Metamodernist_Manifesto|The Metamodernist Manifesto]]'' was written by artist Luke Turner as "an exercise in simultaneously defining and embodying the [[metamodernism|metamodern]] spirit."&lt;ref name="Berfrois-Turner"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.berfrois.com/2015/01/everything-always-wanted-know-metamodernism/ | title=Metamodernism: A Brief Introduction | publisher=Berfrois | date=January 10, 2015 | accessdate=November 22, 2017 | author=Turner, L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto recognised "oscillation to be the natural order of the world" and called for an end to "the inertia resulting from a century of modernist ideological naivety and the cynical insincerity of its antonymous bastard child."&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.herald.co.zw/aint-nobody-praying-for-nietzsche/ | title=Ain’t nobody praying for Nietzsche | publisher=[[The_Herald_(Zimbabwe)|The Herald]] | date=August 28, 2017 | accessdate=November 22, 2017 | author=Mushava, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Turner proposed metamodernism as "the mercurial condition between and beyond irony and sincerity, naivety and knowingness, relativism and truth, optimism and doubt, in pursuit of a plurality of disparate and elusive horizons," and concluded with a call to "go forth and oscillate!"&lt;ref name="Fader"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefader.com/2014/08/08/popping-off-weird-al-drake-pc-music-feedback-loop/ | title=Popping Off: How Weird Al, Drake, PC Music and You Are All Caught up in the Same Feedback Loop | publisher=[[The Fader]] | date=8 August 2014 | accessdate=25 August 2014 | author=Cliff, A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tank"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Potter |first=Cher |date=Spring 2012 |title=Timotheus Vermeulen talks to Cher Potter |journal=[[Tank (magazine)|Tank]]|pages=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto formed the basis of [[LaBeouf, Rönkkö &amp; Turner|LaBeouf, Rönkkö &amp; Turner's]] collaborative art practice, after the actor [[Shia LaBeouf]] reached out to Turner in early 2014 after reading the text.&lt;ref name="co-art"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mara De Wachter |first=Ellen |date=2017 |title=Co-Art: Artists on Creative Collaboration |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Co_Art.html?id=VtpVvgAACAAJ |publisher=[[Phaidon Press]] |page=216 |isbn=9780714872889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buzzfeed-Turner"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/danieldalton/memes-are-wonderful | title=There Needs To Be More Emojis In Art Criticism | publisher=[[Buzzfeed]] | date=July 11, 2016 | accessdate=November 22, 2017 | author=Dalton, D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of manifestos on the internet===
{{original research|section|date=May 2018}}
These manifestos are cited not for their individual significance, but as examples of the diversity of approaches that can be found in manifestos on the web, ranging through computer art, "Gothic" art, jokes, traditional art, punk provocation and the use of the form by commerce. This also allows the influence of historical manifestos on contemporary ideas to be assessed.

'''Fractal Art Manifesto 1999'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kerry Mitchell |authorlink=Kerry Mitchell |url=http://www.fractalus.com/kerry/articles/manifesto/fa-manifesto.html |title=Fractal Art Manifesto |publisher=Fractalus.com |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
by [[Kerry Mitchell]]

There is an introduction followed by two sections—"Fractal art is" (4 bullet points) and "Fractal art is not" (3 bullet points). Fractal art has been around "15–20 years". It is obviously concerned with computer-generated fractal images, but advanced as art "in many respects similar to photography—another art form which was greeted by skepticism upon its arrival. Fractal images typically are manifested as prints, bringing Fractal Artists into the company of painters, photographers, and printmakers." The need for selection and skill is stressed, as is the need for the practitioner to be "expressive" and "creative". It concludes, "Most of all, Fractal Art is simply that which is created by Fractal Artists: ART."

'''OK Art Manifesto 2001'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsterdam.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0105/msg00023.html |title=OK ART Manifesto |publisher=Amsterdam.nettime.org |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
by Susie Ramsay and Rafael Lozano-Hemmer

This was written tongue-in-cheek, beginning, "'OK art' is an OK idea,—not great, but not bad either." It has the ring of truth when it states in point 4: "Art enthusiasts and cynics alike, leave an OK art exhibition saying 'that was OK'. No one is blown away but they don't feel cheated either."

'''Movement for Classical Renewal Manifesto 2002'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalrenewal.org/manifesto.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021211075103/http://www.classicalrenewal.org/manifesto.htm |archivedate=December 11, 2002 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=December 11, 2002 |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Christopher Fiddes

This British manifesto is signed by over 100 painters and sculptors of professional standing. It opens by stating "the visual arts have reached a point of crisis. The art that has enjoyed critical acclaim in recent decades is shallow, trivial, ill-crafted and bankrupt of ideas." It condemns [[abstract art|abstraction]], "the same tired formula" of [[conceptual art|conceptualism]], the Turner Prize and the destruction of art school academic training by the [[Coldstream Committee]] in the mid-20th century. It advocates technical accomplishment, reverence for the "great art that has been in the past" and a return to tradition while also, ironically, acknowledging:
:The arrival of the internet means it is no longer necessary to exhibit one's work in the tiny handful of fashionable London galleries, for at the touch of a switch it can be placed before a world wide public.
An organisation with similar aims in America is the Art Renewal Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artrenewal.org/ |title=artrenewal.org |publisher=artrenewal.org |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This represents the adoption of a revolutionary medium by mainstream commercialism, in this case the Cass Art chain of artshops in London. As part of their promotion they have issued a "manifesto" in the style of an art group. It begins, "Art is freedom. Cass Art believes in art." There are seven points. The sixth starts, "Lets fill this town with artists", which has also been displayed across their shop fronts in a banner.

The '''baldachin of Ribes''' ({{lang-ca|baldaquí de Ribes}}) is a fragmentary [[baldachin|altar-canopy]] in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque style]] now in the [[Museu Episcopal de Vic|Episcopal Museum of Vic]]. It is the masterpiece of the so-called "Ripoll workshop" (''taller de Ripoll''). It dates to the second quarter of the twelfth century. The surviving fragment is only one fourth the size of the original, which contained a central [[mandorla]] with the figure of Christ and four angels on each side.

The style of the baldachin shows strong south French influence, and borrows many features from the tympanum of [[Moissac Abbey]], especially in the robes of Christ. The robes of the angels, however, and the hairstyles of all the figures are more typically Iberian.&lt;ref&gt;Walter W. S. Cook, "The Earliest Painted Panels of Catalonia (I)", ''Art Bulletin'' '''5''':4 (1923), 96–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''coat of arms of Norfolk Island''' is the official symbol of the island and external [[Australia]]n territory of [[Norfolk Island]]. It was granted by a Royal Warrant of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] on 20 October 1980.

The formal description, or [[blazon]], of the Arms is: ''Per chevron Azure and Argent in chief two Mullets of the last and in base issuant from a Rocky Mount charged with a Book expanded proper edged Or leathered Gules a Norfolk Island Pine proper; And for Crest: Out of a Naval Crown Azure a demi-lion Or gorged with a laurel wreath proper and holding a covered cup Or; And for Supporters: On the dexter side a Lion and on the sinister side a Kangaroo proper each resting the exterior foreleg on an Anchor erect Azure; And for the Compartment: a motto "INASMUCH"''

'''Commonplace books''' (or '''commonplaces''') are a way to compile [[knowledge]], usually by writing information into [[book]]s. Such books are essentially [[Scrapbooking|scrapbook]]s filled with items of every kind: recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs, prayers, legal formulas. Commonplaces are used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts they have learned. Each commonplace book is unique to its creator's particular interests. They became significant in [[Early Modern Europe]].

"Commonplace" is a [[Calque|translation]] of the [[Latin]] term ''locus communis'' (from Greek ''tópos koinós'', see [[literary topos]]) which means "a theme or argument of general application", such as a statement of proverbial wisdom. In this original sense, commonplace books were collections of such sayings, such as [[John Milton]]'s commonplace book. Scholars have expanded this usage to include any manuscript that collects material along a common theme by an individual.

Commonplace books are not [[Diary|diaries]] nor
[[Travel journal#Travelogues|travelogues]], with which they can be contrasted:
English Enlightenment philosopher [[John Locke]] wrote the 1706 book ''A New Method of Making Common-Place-Books'', "in which techniques for entering proverbs, quotations, ideas, speeches were formulated. Locke gave specific advice on how to arrange material by subject and category, using such key topics as love, politics, or religion. Commonplace books, it must be stressed, are not journals, which are chronological and introspective."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas A. Basbanes]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=o4K_KMO1DWUC&amp;pg=PA82 "Every Book Its Reader: The Power of the Printed Word to Stir the World"], Harper Perennial, 2006, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early eighteenth century they had become an information management device in which a note-taker stored quotations, observations and definitions.  They were even used by influential scientists.  [[Carl Linnaeus]], for instance, used commonplacing techniques to invent and arrange the nomenclature of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (which is the basis for the system used by scientists today).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=M. D.|title=Tools for Reordering: Commonplacing and the Space of Words in Linnaeus's Philosophia Botanica|journal=Intellectual History Review|date=2010|volume=20|pages=227–252|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112087/Tools_for_Reordering_Commonplacing_and_the_Space_of_Words_in_Linnaeuss_Philosophia_Botanica_Intellectual_History_Review_20_2010_227-252|doi=10.1080/17496971003783773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Zibaldone===
[[File:Zibaldone di pensieri VI.djvu|thumb|right|''Zibaldone di pensieri'', written by the Italian [[poet]] [[Giacomo Leopardi]]]]
During the course of the 15th century, the Italian peninsula was the site of a development of two new forms of book production: the deluxe registry book and the [[zibaldone]] (or hodgepodge book). What differentiated these two forms was their language of composition: a vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;Armando Petrucci, ''Writers and Readers in Medieval Italy'', trans. Charles M. Radding (New Haven: Yale UP: 1995), 185.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai|Giovanni Rucellai]], the compiler of one of the most sophisticated examples of the genre, defined it as a "salad of many herbs."&lt;ref&gt;Dale V. Kent, ''Cosimo de' Medici and the Florentine Renaissance: The Patron's Oeuvre'' (New Haven and London: Yale UP, 2000), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Zibaldone were always paper codices of small or medium format – never the large desk copies of registry books or other display texts. They also lacked the lining and extensive ornamentation of other deluxe copies. Rather than miniatures, zibaldone often incorporate the author's sketches. Zibaldone were in cursive scripts (first [[chancery minuscule]] and later [[mercantile minuscule]]) and contained what [[palaeographer]] [[Armando Petrucci]] describes as "an astonishing variety of poetic and prose texts."&lt;ref&gt;Petrucci, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Devotional, technical, documentary and literary texts appear side-by-side in no discernible order. The juxtaposition of [[gabelle tax]]es paid, currency exchange rates, medicinal remedies, recipes and favourite quotations from [[Augustine]] and [[Virgil]] portrays a developing secular, literate culture.&lt;ref&gt;An example is the [http://www.metafilter.com/46800/Commonplace-books Zibaldone da Canal] merchant's manual held at the Beinecke Library, which dates from 1312 and contains hand-drawn diagrams of Venetian ships and descriptions of Venice's merchant culture.&lt;/ref&gt; By far the most popular of literary selections were the works of [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Francesco Petrarca]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]: the "Three Crowns" of the Florentine vernacular traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, pg. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; These collections have been used by modern scholars as a source for interpreting how merchants and artisans interacted with the literature and visual arts of the Florentine Renaissance.

The best-known zibaldone is [[Giacomo Leopardi]]'s nineteenth-century ''[[Zibaldone di pensieri]]''.

===English===

By the 17th century, commonplacing had become a recognized practice that was formally taught to college students in such institutions as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Victoria|title=Recent Studies in Commonplace Books.|journal=English Literary Renaissance|date=2013|volume=43|issue=1|page=154|doi=10.1111/1475-6757.12005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] appended his indexing scheme for commonplace books to a printing of his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2010/04/the-glass-box-and-the-commonplace-book.html "The Glass Box And The Commonplace Book"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The commonplace tradition in which [[Francis Bacon]] and [[John Milton]] were educated had its roots in the pedagogy of classical [[rhetoric]], and “commonplacing” persisted as a popular study technique until the early 20th century. Commonplace books were used by many key thinkers of the Enlightenment, with authors like the philosopher and theologian [[William Paley]] using them to write books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=M. D.|title=he Science and Rhetoric of Paley’s Natural Theology|journal=Literature and Theology|date=2004|volume=18|pages=1–22|url=https://www.academia.edu/3667401/_The_Science_and_Rhetoric_of_Paley_s_Natural_Theology_Literature_and_Theology_18_2004_1-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] were taught to keep commonplace books at [[Harvard University]] (their commonplace books survive in published form).  Commonplacing was particularly attractive to authors.  Some, such as [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Mark Twain]] kept messy reading notes that were intermixed with other quite various material; others, such as [[Thomas Hardy]], followed a more formal reading-notes method that mirrored the original [[Renaissance]] practice more closely. The older, "clearinghouse" function of the commonplace book, to condense and centralize useful and even "model" ideas and expressions, became less popular over time.

==Contemporary evaluations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}

Many of these works are not seen to have literary value to modern editors. The value of such collections is the insights they offer into the tastes, interests, personalities and concerns of their individual compilers.

Keeping notebooks is a kind of tradition among authors.  Therefore, a commonplace book of literary memoranda may serve as a symbol to the keeper, of the keeper's literary identity (or something psychologically not far removed), quite apart from its obvious value as a written record. Authors frequently treat their notebooks as quasi-works, giving them elaborate titles, compiling them neatly from rough notes, recompiling still neater revisions of them later, and preserving them with a special devotion and care that seems out of proportion to their apparent function as working materials.

==Examples in manuscript==
*[[Zibaldone da Canal]] merchant's commonplace book (New Haven, CT, Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, MS 327)
*[[Robert Reynes of Acle]], Norfolk (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Tanner 407)].
*Richard Hill, a London grocer (Oxford, Balliol College, MS 354).
*Glastonbury Miscellany. (Trinity College, Cambridge, MS 0.9.38). Originally designed as an account book.
*[[Jean Miélot]], 15th-century Burgundian translator and author. His book is in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], and the main sources for his verses, many written for court occasions.

==Published examples==
*[[Francis Bacon]], ''"The Promus of Formularies and Elegancies",'' Longman, Greens and Company, London, 1883. The Promus was a rough list of elegant and useful phrases gleaned from reading and conversation that Bacon used as a source book in writing and probably also as a promptbook for oral practice in public speaking.
*[[John Milton]], "Milton’s Commonplace Book," in ''John Milton:  Complete Prose Works'', gen. ed. Don M. Wolfe (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1953).  Milton kept scholarly notes from his reading, complete with page citations to use in writing his tracts and poems.
*[[E.M. Forster]], "Commonplace Book," ed. Philip Gardner (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1985).
*[[W.H. Auden]], ''[[A Certain World]]'' (New York: The Viking Press, 1970).
*{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/07/h-p-lovecrafts-commonplace-book/|title=Commonplace Book|last=Lovecraft|first=H.P.| authorlink = H. P. Lovecraft|date=4 July 2011|work=H.P. Lovecraft's Commonplace Book|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=5 July 2011}} Transcribed by [[Bruce Sterling]].

==Literary references to commonplacing==
* [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], 1877:  "The habit of journalizing becomes a life-long lesson in the art of composition, an informal schooling for authorship. And were the process of preparing their works for publication faithfully detailed by distinguished writers, it would appear how large were their indebtedness to their diary and commonplaces. How carefully should we peruse Shakespeare's notes used in compiling his plays—what was his, what another's—showing how these were fashioned into the shapely whole we read, how Milton composed, Montaigne, Goethe: by what happy strokes of thought, flashes of wit, apt figures, fit quotations snatched from vast fields of learning, their rich pages were wrought forth! This were to give the keys of great authorship!"  Amos Bronson Alcott,'' Table-Talk of A. Bronson Alcott'' (Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1877), p.&amp;nbsp;12.
* [[Virginia Woolf]], mid-20th century: "[L]et us take down one of those old notebooks which we have all, at one time or another, had a passion for beginning. Most of the pages are blank, it is true; but at the beginning we shall find a certain number very beautifully covered with a strikingly legible hand-writing. Here we have written down the names of great writers in their order of merit; here we have copied out fine passages from the classics; here are lists of books to be read; and here, most interesting of all, lists of books that have actually been read, as the reader testifies with some youthful vanity by a dash of red ink."  Virginia Woolf, "Hours in a Library," ''Granite and Rainbow: Essays by Virginia Woolf''  (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1958), p.&amp;nbsp;25.
* In [[Lemony Snicket]]'s ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' a number of characters including Klaus Baudelaire and the Quagmire triplets keep commonplace books.
* In [[Michael Ondaatje]]'s ''[[The English Patient]]'', Count Almásy uses his copy of [[Herodotus]]'s ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' as a commonplace book.
* In [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories, Holmes keeps numerous commonplace books, which he sometimes uses when doing research.  For example, in "[[The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger]]", he researches the newspaper reports of an old murder in a commonplace book.

'''''Crab on its Back''''' ({{lang-nl|Een op zijn rug liggende krab}}) is an [[oil painting]] by [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It is a [[still life]] of a [[crab]] lying on its back with a green background. The [[Van Gogh Museum]] dates the work to August-September 1887,&lt;ref name="vgm"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0124V1962|title=A Crab on its Back - Van Gogh Museum|website=www.vangoghmuseum.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other sources date it to early 1889.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gdkn6yCOi6sC&amp;pg=PA155 Vincent van Gogh], Victoria Charles, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is in the permanent collection of the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="vgm"/&gt;

The painting is possibly inspired by a Japanese print of a crab by [[Hokusai]] that Van Gogh had seen in the magazine ''[[Le Japon Artistique]]'', which his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]] had sent him in September 1888.&lt;ref name="vgm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalgallery"/&gt;

'''Cryptomnesia''' occurs when a forgotten memory returns without it being recognized as such by the subject, who believes it is something new and original. It is a [[memory bias]] whereby a person may falsely recall generating a thought, an idea, a tune, or a joke,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, F..K. (1965).Cryptomnesia and plagiarism. British Journal of Psychiatry, 111, 1111–1118.&lt;/ref&gt; not deliberately engaging in [[plagiarism]] but rather experiencing a memory as if it were a new inspiration.

==Early use==

The first documented instance of cryptomnesia occurred in 1874 with the medium [[Stainton Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Righi. (2008). ''Chapter 4: Talking Boards and Ghostly Goo''. In ''Ghosts, Apparitions and Poltergeists''. Llewellyn Publications. {{ISBN|978-0738713632}} "An early example of this occurred in 1874 with he medium William Stanton Moses, who communicated with the spirits of two brothers who had recently died in India. Upon investigation, it was discovered that one week prior to the séance, their obituary had appeared in the newspaper. This was of some importance because Moses's communications with the two spirits contained nothing that wasn't already printed in the newspaper. When the spirits were pressed for further information, they were unable to provide any. Researchers concluded that Moses had seen the obituary, forgotten it, and then resurfaced the memory during the séance."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Todd Carroll]]. (2014). [http://skepdic.com/cryptomn.html "Cryptomnesia"]. ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]''. Retrieved 2014-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was first used by the psychiatrist [[Théodore Flournoy]],&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Flournoy, ''From India to the Planet Mars: A Case of Multiple Personality with Imaginary Languages'' (1901/1994) quoted at www.answers.com/topic/cryptomnesia-psychoanalysis&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the case of medium [[Hélène Smith]] (Catherine-Élise Müller) to suggest the high incidence in psychism of "latent memories on the part of the medium that come out, sometimes greatly disfigured by a subliminal work of imagination or reasoning, as so often happens in our ordinary dreams."

[[Carl Gustav Jung]] treated the subject in his thesis "On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena" (1902)&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl Gustav. (1902). On the psychology and pathology of so-called occult phenomena. Coll. works, Vol. 1, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; and in an article, "Cryptomnesia" (1905),&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl Gustav. (1905). Cryptomnesia. Coll. works, Vol. 1, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; United States Bollingen Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested the phenomenon in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. The idea was studied or mentioned by Géza Dukes, Sándor Ferenczi and Wilhelm Stekel as well as by Sigmund Freud in speaking of the originality of his inventions.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. (1920). ''A note on the prehistory of the technique of analysis'' SE 18: 263-265. (1923) and ''Josef Popper-Lynkeus and the theory of dreams'' SE 19: 259-263.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental research==
In the first empirical study of cryptomnesia, people in a group took turns generating category examples (e.g., kinds of birds: parrot, canary, etc.). They were later asked to create new exemplars in the same categories that were not previously produced, and also to recall which words they had personally generated. People inadvertently plagiarized about 3–9% of the time either by regenerating another person's thought or falsely recalling someone's thought as their own.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, A. S., &amp; Murphy, D. R. (1989). Cryptomnesia: Delineating inadvertent plagiarism. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 15, 432–442.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar effects have been replicated using other tasks such as word search puzzles&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, R. L., &amp; Bower, G. H. (1993). Eliciting cryptomnesia: Unconscious plagiarism in a puzzle task. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 19, 673–688.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, R. L. &amp; Landau, J. D. (1995). Item availability in cryptomnesia: Assessing its role in two paradigms of unconscious plagiarism. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 21, 1568–1582.&lt;/ref&gt; and in brainstorming sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, R. L. Landau, J. D. Hicks, J. L. (1997). Contributions of inadequate source monitoring to unconscious plagiarism during idea generation. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 23, 886–897.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has distinguished between two kinds of cryptomnesia, though they are often studied together. The distinction between these two types of plagiarism is in the underlying memory bias responsible—specifically, is it the thought that is forgotten, or the thinker? The first type of bias is one of familiarity. The plagiarizer regenerates an idea that was presented earlier, but believes the idea to be an original creation. The idea that is reproduced could be another's idea, or one's own from a previous time. [[B. F. Skinner]] describes his own experience of self-plagiarism:

{{quote|One of the most disheartening experiences of old age is discovering that a point you just made—so significant, so beautifully expressed—was made by you in something you published long ago.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1983) Intellectual self-management in old age. American Psychologist, 38, 239–244.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The second type of cryptomnesia results from an error of authorship whereby the ideas of others are remembered as one's own. In this case, the plagiarizer correctly recognizes that the idea is from an earlier time, but falsely remembers having been the origin for the idea (or, having lost the specific memory of encountering it in print or conversation, assumes that it "came to" the plagiarizer as an original idea).
Various terms have been coined to distinguish these two forms of plagiarism&amp;nbsp;— occurrence forgetting vs. source forgetting and generation errors vs. recognition errors. The two types of cryptomnesia appear to be independent: no relationship has been found between error rates&lt;ref&gt;Brown, A. S., &amp; Halliday, H. E. (1991). Cryptomnesia and source memory difficulties. American Journal of Psychology, 104, 475–490.&lt;/ref&gt; and the two types are precipitated by different causes.&lt;ref&gt;Bredart, S., Lampinen., J. M., &amp; Defeldre, A. (2003) Phenomenal characteristics of cryptomnesia. Memory, 11, 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Cryptomnesia is more likely to occur when the ability to properly monitor sources is impaired. For example, people are more likely to falsely claim ideas as their own when they were under high cognitive load at the time they first considered the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Macrae, C.N., Bodenhasen, G. V. &amp; Calvini, G. (1999). Contexts of cryptomnesia: May the source be with you. Social Cognition, 17, 273–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Plagiarism increases when people are away from the original source of the idea, and decreases when participants are specifically instructed to pay attention to the origin of their ideas. False claims are also more prevalent for ideas originally suggested by persons of the same sex, presumably because the perceptual similarity of the self to a same-sex person exacerbates source confusion. In other studies it has been found that the timing of the idea is also important: if another person produces an idea immediately before the self produces an idea, the other's idea is more likely to be claimed as one's own, ostensibly because the person is too busy preparing for their own turn to properly monitor source information. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

in ''[[Man and His Symbols]],'' "An author may be writing steadily to a preconceived plan, working out an argument or developing the line of a story, when he suddenly runs off at a tangent. Perhaps a fresh idea has occurred to him, or a different image, or a whole new sub-plot. If you ask him what prompted the digression, he will not be able to tell you. He may not even have noticed the change, though he has now produced material that is entirely fresh and apparently unknown to him before. Yet it can sometimes be shown convincingly that what he has written bears a striking similarity to the work of another author&amp;nbsp;— a work that he believes he has never seen."

[[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s story, "[[Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote]]," is a meta-fictive enactment of cryptomnesia. This work is written in the form of a review or literary critical piece about (the nonexistent) Pierre Menard. It begins with a brief introduction and a listing of all of Menard's work.

Borges's "review" describes this 20th-century French writer who has made an effort to go further than mere "translation" of Don Quixote, but to immerse himself so thoroughly as to be able to actually "re-create" it, line for line, in the original 16th century Spanish. Thus, "Pierre Menard" is often used to raise questions and discussion about the nature of accurate translation or, in this case, the [[hermeneutics]] of cryptomnesia.

==Cases==

===Nietzsche===
Jung gives the following example in ''[[Man and His Symbols]]''.&lt;ref name="jung_nietzsche"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shellofman.com/post/8962298822/cryptomnesia-occurs-when-a-forgotten-memory|title=Cryptomnesia|publisher=Shell of Man|accessdate=15 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020741/http://shellofman.com/post/8962298822/cryptomnesia-occurs-when-a-forgotten-memory|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s book ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' includes an almost word for word account of an incident also included in a book published about 1835, half a century before Nietzsche wrote. This is considered to be neither purposeful plagiarism nor pure coincidence: Nietzsche's sister confirmed that he had indeed read the original account when he was 11 years old; Nietzsche's youthful intellectual capabilities, his later cognitive degeneration, and his accompanying psychological deterioration (specifically, his increasing [[Delusions of grandeur|grandiosity]] as manifested in his later behavior and writings) together strengthen the likelihood that he happened to commit the passage to memory upon initially reading it and later, after having lost his memory of encountering it, assumed that his own mind had created it.&lt;ref name="nietzsche_on_gender"&gt;{{cite book |last=Oppel|first=Frances|date=2005|title=Nietzsche On Gender|publisher=University of Virginia Press|isbn=0-8139-2320-4|page=204|quote=The book of adventure stories as "source" was discovered by Carl Jung, who describes his find, and his subsequent belief that Nietzsche had "crpytomnesia,"&lt;!--sic?--&gt; the concealed recollection of a textual memory, to his seminar of fellow depth psychologists who gathered once a week between 1934 and 1939 to analyze ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''. The piece of text "secretly crept up and reproduced itself" in "Of Great Events" (Z 2). Jung recognized the story about seamen stopping on an island to hunt rabbits, having read it in his grandfather's library. He wrote Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche, who confirmed that she and Nietzsche had read the same book in their grandfather's library, when Nietzsche was eleven. This, Jung informed his Zarathustra seminar, "shows how the unconscious layers of the mind work." He added, "the absolute parallel is of course formed by the rabbits" (1218).}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byron===
In some cases, the line between cryptomnesia and [[zeitgeist]] (compare the concept of [[multiple discovery]] in science) may be somewhat hazy. Readers of [[Lord Byron]]'s [[closet drama]] ''[[Manfred]]'' noted a strong resemblance to [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''. In a review published in 1820, Goethe wrote, "Byron's tragedy ''Manfred'' was to me a wonderful phenomenon, and one that closely touched me. This singular intellectual poet has taken my Faustus to himself, and extracted from it the strangest nourishment for his hypochondriac humour. He has made use of the impelling principles in his own way, for his own purposes, so that no one of them remains the same; and it is particularly on this account that I cannot enough admire his genius."&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in ''Lord Byron: The Critical Heritage'' by Andrew Rutherford [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2xuKwGa1jYC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=goethe+manfred&amp;source=web&amp;ots=-Lb_tHZjqA&amp;sig=Q9KLd8996m_UjfWfOowNM-YTT9M&amp;hl=en#PPA109,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; Byron was apparently thankful for the compliment; however, he claimed that he had
never read ''Faustus''.

===Barrie===

[[J. M. Barrie]], the creator of [[Peter Pan]], was aware of the occurrence of cryptomnesia. In ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peter and Wendy|last=Barrie|first=J. M.|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|year=1911|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy sews Peter's shadow back on and this makes him very happy but he immediately thinks he has attached the shadow himself:

“How clever I am,” he crowed rapturously, “oh, the cleverness of me!”

Peter exhibits a number of other clinically accurate peculiarities of memory suggesting that Barrie regarded Peter's behavior as a memory disorder rather than self-centredness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peter Pan and the Mind of J. M. Barrie|last=Ridley|first=Rosalind|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4438-9107-3|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keller===
[[Helen Keller]] compromised her and her teacher's credibility with an incident of cryptomnesia which was misinterpreted as [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bailey. "[https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2015/02/10/5-great-people-who-plagiarized/ 5 Great People Who Plagiarized]". ''Plagiarism Today'', February 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Frost King]]'', which Keller wrote out of buried memories of a fairy tale read to her four years previously, left Keller a nervous wreck, and unable to write fiction for the rest of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foer|first=Joshua|title=No one has a photographic memory|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2006/04/kaavya_syndrome.single.html|work=Slate|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stevenson===
[[Robert Louis Stevenson]] refers to an incident of cryptomnesia that took place during the writing of ''[[Treasure Island]]'', and that he discovered to his embarrassment several years afterward:

{{quote|...I am now upon a painful chapter. No doubt the parrot once belonged to [[Robinson Crusoe]]. No doubt the skeleton is conveyed from [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]. I think little of these, they are trifles and details; and no man can hope to have a monopoly of skeletons or make a corner in talking birds. The stockade, I am told, is from ''[[Masterman Ready, or the Wreck of the Pacific|Masterman Ready]]''. It may be, I care not a jot. These useful writers had fulfilled the poet's saying: departing, they had left behind them Footprints on the [[Sands of time (idiom)|sands of time]], Footprints which perhaps another&amp;nbsp;— and I was the other! It is my debt to [[Washington Irving]] that exercises my conscience, and justly so, for I believe plagiarism was rarely carried farther. I chanced to pick up the Tales of a Traveller some years ago with a view to an anthology of prose narrative, and the book flew up and struck me: Billy Bones, his chest, the company in the parlour, the whole inner spirit, and a good deal of the material detail of my first chapters&amp;nbsp;— all were there, all were the property of Washington Irving. But I had no guess of it then as I sat writing by the fireside, in what seemed the spring-tides of a somewhat pedestrian inspiration; nor yet day by day, after lunch, as I read aloud my morning's work to the family. It seemed to me original as sin; it seemed to belong to me like my right eye...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/rlstevenson/bl-rlst-wri-5.htm |title=The Art of Writing |author=Stevenson, Robert Louis |work=[http://classiclit.about.com/ About.com:Classic Literature] |publisher= |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===George Harrison===
The precedent in United States [[copyright]] law, since 1976, has been to treat alleged cryptomnesia no differently from deliberate plagiarism. The seminal case is ''Bright Tunes Music v. [[Harrisongs]] Music,''&lt;ref&gt;420 F. Supp. 177 (S.D.N.Y. 1976), ''available at'' {{cite web |url=http://cip.law.ucla.edu/cases/case_brightharrisongs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326082447/http://cip.law.ucla.edu/cases/case_brightharrisongs.html |archivedate=2009-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the publisher of "[[He's So Fine]]," written and composed by [[Ronnie Mack|Ronald Mack]], demonstrated to the court that [[George Harrison]] borrowed substantial portions of his song "[[My Sweet Lord]]" from "He's So Fine." The Court imposed damages despite a claim that the copying was subconscious. The ruling was upheld by the Second Circuit in ''ABKCO Music v. Harrisongs Music,''&lt;ref&gt;722 F.2d 988, 221 U.S.P.Q. 490, ''available at'' http://digital-law-online.info/cases/221PQ490.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the case ''Three Boys Music v. Michael Bolton,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Boys Music v. Michael Bolton 212 F.3d 477 (9th Cir.2000)|url=http://mcir.usc.edu/cases/2000-2009/Pages/threeboysbolton.html|website=Music Copyright Infringement Source|publisher=USC Gould School of Law|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; upheld by the Ninth Circuit, affirmed the principle.

===McCullough===

In 1987, Australian author [[Colleen McCullough]] published a novella, ''[[The Ladies of Missalonghi]]''. Critics alleged that she had plagiarised ''[[The Blue Castle]]'', a 1926 novel by [[L. M. Montgomery]]. McCullough acknowledged having read Montgomery's works in her youth, but attributed the similarities to subconscious recollection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maunder|first1=Patricia|title=Outspoken writer Colleen McCullough praised by all except literary establishment|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/outspoken-writer-colleen-mccullough-praised-by-all-except-literary-establishment-20150130-131wf9.html|accessdate=12 September 2016|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=30 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819182640/http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/outspoken-writer-colleen-mccullough-praised-by-all-except-literary-establishment-20150130-131wf9.html|archivedate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eco===
In ''Interpretation and Overinterpretation'', [[Umberto Eco]] describes the rediscovery of an antique book among his large collection, which was eerily similar to the pivotal object in his novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]''.

{{quote|I had bought that book in my youth, skimmed through it, realized that it was exceptionally soiled, and put it somewhere and forgot it. But by a sort of internal camera I had photographed those pages, and for decades the image of those poisonous leaves lay in the most remote part of my soul, as in a grave, until the moment it emerged again (I do not know for what reason) and I believed I had invented it.&lt;ref name="EcoCollini1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Umberto Eco|authorlink1=Umberto Eco|author2=Stefan Collini |author3=Richard Rorty |author4=Jonathan Culler |author5=Christine Brooke-Rose|title=Interpretation and overinterpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbhROmD3guQC|accessdate=24 August 2011|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42554-4|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Cín Lae Uí Mhealláin''' is an account of the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] written by [[Tarlach Ó Mealláin]], [[Ordo Fratrum Minorum|OFM]].

Described as "an account of the progress of the Confederate war from the outbreak of rebellion in 1641 until February 1647" its text "reflected the [[Ulster]] Catholic point of view."

==Description==

The text was first described as ''Cín Lae Uí Mhealláin'' by Professor Tadhg Ó Donnchadha in 1931, Cín Lae being the Irish term for 'diary.' It is written on both sides of twenty-two small sheets of paper (approximately 18.5&amp;nbsp;cm by 14&amp;nbsp;cm). The narrative comes to an abrupt end on the 28th line of page forty-four; "Tanic trí mile saigdeor ón Pharlemeint i nÁth C. i n-aghaidh Laighneach agus each...."

It is housed at the Boole Library at [[University College, Cork]], as MS 3.

==Facets ==

In his introduction to the text, Charles Dillon points out that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Tarlach had a detailed knowledge of the Ulster leaders. As he was familiar too with many of the places in which they fought, he is an invaluable source for the general historian, toponomyst and genealogist and, because of his language, he is an invaluable source for the linguist and the historian of Irish as well."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reasons for composition==

Ó Doibhlin opines that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[It] might have been more accurately named a Commonplace Book kept by Ó Mealláin, possibly at the instigation of the leader of the rebellion, Sir Pheilim O'Neill of Caledon. It looks very much like a notebook the writer had with him in the field and he may have hoped that the notes taken down would at some stage in the future act as an aide memoire for a fuller, more extensive account."
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Charles Dillon concurs, stating that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Cín Lae was written in abbreviated form, apparently as a memory aid to the author who may have intended to produce a fuller history of the period at a later date. Sadly, no such history appears to have been written ... [although] ... he ... had the opportunity of revising at least part of the script."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Extracts==

The text begins thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"One the eve of the Feast of Saint John Capistranus the lords of Ulster planned to seize in one night, unknown to the English and the Scots, all their walled towns, castles and bawns. The date chosen was 22nd&amp;nbsp;October, Friday to be precise, and the last day of the moon." (Saturday 23 October 1641, Old Style)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On one occasion Ó Mealláin describes O'Neill rousing the troops:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Do bhí an General ag teagasc imeasc an tsloigh. Iseadh adubhairt 'Ag sud chuagaibh escairde Dé agus naimhde bhur n-anma; agus denaidh calmacht 'na n-aghadh aniu; oir is iad do ben dibh ar (leg. bhur) dtigheranaidh, bhur gclann agus bhur mbeatha spiordalta agus temporalta, do bhen bhur nduthaigh dibh, is do chuir ar deoruigheach sibh etc."/"The General  was in the midst of his men exorting them. 'Here before you are the enemies of God, and your souls enemies; and be courageous against them today for it is they who took away your lordships, your families, your spiritual and temporal lives, and sent you into exile."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere, he describes the terrible effect of the war on the general population (daoine san tír):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Atá, daoine san tír, Cathanaigh, Duibhlinigh, muinter Ara, Ibh Eathach agus clann Aodh Bui uile an Ruta ag ithe capall, each: deireadh earraigh; a ghoid; fuadach cat, madraidh; ag ithe daoine, leathar carbaidhi, agus leathar fo na aol." "There are people in the country, O'Kanes, O'Devlins, the people of Ara and [[Iveagh]], inhabitants of [[Clandeboy]] and the Route eating horsemeat; the end of spring; thieving and the stealing of dogs and cats; [[cannibalism]], eating the leather of carriages and leather treated with lime."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other occasions described include a number of combats and battles, such as [[Benburb]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">The '''Edinburgh Film Guild (EFG)''' is a [[film society]] based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. Founded in 1929, it is notable as the oldest continually running film society in the world. Though pre-dated by the original (London) Film Society, founded five years earlier, it has outlasted it, with the Film Society having ceased operation in 1939. The EFG is also of note for having established the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] in 1947.

According to Scottish [[Film theory|film theorist]] and documentarian [[John Grierson]] the EFG was of particular importance for promoting a wide view of [[film|cinema]]. Writing in 1951 he commented:

"The old London Film Society was the first to break from somewhat exclusive attention to the [[avant-garde]] and take the longer and harder way of the [[Russia]]ns and more purposive users of the cinema. But it was the Edinburgh Film Guild which completed the movement - as the London Film Society did not - and saw the infinite variety of a Film Society's obligations to all categories of the medium".&lt;ref&gt;[http://edinburghfilmguild.org.uk/about.php Article about the history of the Edinburgh Film Guild]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1980 the EFG has been based in the Filmhouse Cinema in Lothian Road, Edinburgh, where it has its clubrooms, [[office]]s and cinema.

Run by volunteers on a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] basis, the EFG screens films three days a week from late September through to April. The programme is organised on the basis of mini-seasons linked by some common element, of [[Film director|director]], [[performer]], country, [[genre]] or theme.

Since 2005 the EFG has hosted the bi-annual Edinburgh International Film Audiences Conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmaudiencesconference.co.uk/ EIFAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''national emblem of [[Mozambique]]''' was adopted in 1990 in the Constitution of Mozambique article 194. The article clearly states the design and meaning of the device. It shows a [[gear wheel]], bordered by [[Maize|corn]] stalks and [[sugarcane]]. In the middle there is a red sun over a map of Mozambique in green, and blue waves, an [[AK-47]] crossed with a hoe, and a book. The wreath is tied with a ribbon bearing the name of the country. The emblem is "[[socialist heraldry]]" style similar to those of the [[Soviet republics]].

As described in the Mozambican constitution article 194,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernafricalawcenter.org/files/tbl_s5107SAPublications%5CFileUpload5913%5C12%5CMozambique.pdf  'The Constitution of The Republic of Mozambique']&lt;/ref&gt; the various parts of the emblem have a special symbolism, i.e.
* the corn stalk and the sugar cane represent agricultural wealth
* the cog wheel represents labor and industry
* the book represents [[Education in Mozambique|education]]
* the hoe for "peasantry and [[Agriculture in Mozambique|agriculture]] production"
* the AK-47, with a bayonet attached, for "defense and vigilance"
* the red star represents the spirit of international solidarity of the [[Demographics of Mozambique|Mozambican people]]".
* the red sun symbolizes the building of a new life

From 1975-1982, the map of Mozambique was brown instead of green. Along with this change of colour, the position of the wreath was changed, the text was changed from black to gold, and a gold border was added around the red star.

In 1990, with the implementation of the new constitution, the name of the country was changed from ''República Popular de Moçambique'' to ''República de Moçambique'', and the text on the emblem was changed accordingly.

[[RENAMO|Mozambique's parliamentary opposition]] would specifically like to see removed the image of the [[AK-47|Kalashnikov assault rifle]], which symbolizes the nation's struggle for independence, according to press reports.&lt;ref name=bbc-no-ak47&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4550842.stm | work=BBC News | title=Are you passionate about your flag? | date=December 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''gigantomachy by the Suessula Painter''' is a painting on a red-figure amphora from the [[Classical Greece|Classical period of Greece]]. It is the work of the "Suessula Painter", an Athenian vase-painter whose name is unknown. He worked in both Corinth and Athens and is recognizable by his style, with great freedom of posture and a unique shading of figures. This red-figure amphora was made around 410-400 BCE and is 69.5 cm tall, 32 cm large. It is currently conserved in the Louvre Museum.

== The Gigantomachy  ==
This vase is separated in registers, with the largest register being the only one decorated with mythological scenes one encircling the belly of the amphora is the only one decorated with mythological scenes, the one below is empty and the one above is simply covered in floral motives. 
The interesting thing about this vase is the difference between the side A and B. Both are a representation of the [[Gigantomachy]], the fight between the Giants, Gaïa's sons and the Olympian gods, accompanied by [[Herakles]]. The first side is much more elaborated than the second one, and it led specialists to believe that it might be a reproduction of the Gigantomachy of  [[Phidias]] depicted inside the shield of the Parthenon Athena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/doc/crai_0065-0536_1963_num_107_3_11583?q=suessula "L'Amphore de la Gigantomachie de Milo au Musée du Louvre"] by Pierre Devambez in Comptes rendus des séances de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres  Année 1963  Volume 107  Numéro 3  pp. 282-284&lt;/ref&gt;
On the side A, we can see [[Zeus]] ready to hit a Giant identified as [[Porphyrion]] &lt;ref&gt;Jane Henle, Greek Myths, A Vase Painter’s Notebook (Bloomington; Indian University Press, 1973), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; with his lightning bolt, next to [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] on a chariot run by horses, while [[Dionysus]]' chariot one is run by panthers. [[Poseidon]] is on the same side, on the back of a horse. [[Athena]] and Herakles – with his leonte, the skin of the lionof Nemea, that he had to kill for his first labor –  are fighting side by side, under Nike's carriage. Around them, and recognizable by their varying attributes are [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]] and [[Hermes]]. They all are fighting giants, recognizable by the fact that they are not wearing any kind of clothes. 
On the side B, which, as it is not as intricate as the side A, and was interpreted as a filling of the other side, a reproduction of the shield, we can see the rest of that Gigantomachy scene, with [[Ares]] and [[Aphrodite]] on a chair in the middle. [[Demeter]], [[Persephone]], [[Hekate]] and the [[Dioskouroi]] are also present and fighting the giants.

To fully understand the meaning of that vase painting, it is necessary to place it back in its context. It was made by an Athenian artist in the Vth century, at the peak of the Athenian imperialism over the Greek world, afer they both won the [[Greco-Persian wars]] and took control of the treasury of the[[Delian League]]. During that time, the High Classical Period, representations of Gigantomachy, Centoromachy or amazonomachy were quite common. Those depictions of the Olympian Gods triumphing over lesser, or foreigner societies were used as a metaphor of the Athenian victory over the Persians, and their now supremacy over Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1483525?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents "On Iconology, Intention, Imagos, and Myths of Meaning"] by Seymour Howard in Artibus et Historiae, Vol. 17, No. 34 (1996), pp. 83-94&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4001">'''Jean d'Arras''' (fl. 1392-94) was a 14th-century Northern [[France|French]] writer about whom little is known.

He collaborated with Antoine du Val and Fouquart de Cambrai in putting together a collection of stories entitled ''L'Évangile des quenouilles'' ("The spinners' gospel"). The [[frame story]] is a group of ladies at their spinning who relate the current theories on a great variety of subjects. The work is of considerable value for the light it throws on [[medieval]] manners, and for its echoes of folklore, sometimes deeply buried under layers of [[Christianity]].

There were many editions of this book in the 15th and 16th centuries, one of which was printed by the early printer [[Wynkyn de Worde]] in English, as ''The Gospelles of Dystaves''. A more modern edition (Collection Jannet) had a preface by [[Anatole France]].

==The Roman de Mélusine==

Jean d'Arras, perhaps the same, wrote at the request of [[John, duke of Berry]], as he says in his introduction, a long prose romance variously called the ''Roman de Mélusine'' or the ''Chronique de Melusine'' part of ''Le Noble Hystoire de Lusignan'' ("The Noble History of the Lusignans"), in 1392-94. He dedicated the work to [[Marie of Valois, Duchess of Bar]] and expressed the hope that it would aid in the political education of her children.

Leaning on perhaps mostly oral tradition surrounding the originally Celtic region of Poitou, it is one of the first literary versions of the tale of [[Melusine]], a fairy cursed by her fairy mother to become a hybrid woman/serpent every Saturday. If she married a mortal man who remained faithful to her and obeyed her request never to seek her out on that day, she would gain the status of a mortal woman and enjoy salvation as a Christian. She guided the spectacular rise and subsequent fall of the House of [[Lusignan]] after she met the nobleman Rainmondin by a fountain in the forest, who married her and fathered ten sons on her whose exploits in the [[Crusade]]s brought them fame, despite the fact that most of them carried some form of physical blemish. Raimondin remains faithful to his promise until he is persuaded to believe that her hiding every Saturday is an excuse for her to entertain a lover, and he spies on her in her bath. He doesn't betray her secret until one of their most deformed sons, Geoffrey Big-Tooth, burns down the monastery his brother Fromont has retired to. In despair, Raimondin curses her publicly for her demonic nature that has infected their sons, and she turns into a dragon and flies away, wailing.

[[File:Alon_Yzrael.jpeg|thumb|Alon Jezreel Contemporary Dance Company performing in 2012]]

The '''Jezreel Valley Contemporary Dance Festival''' is an annual [[contemporary dance]] festival that takes place during the [[Jewish]] holiday of [[Shavuot]], as part of the Milk &amp; Honey Festival in the [[Jezreel Valley]], [[Israel]]. The festival was established by contemporary dance association "Alon Jezreel" and choreographer Ze'ev Keren in 2010, and hosts contemporary dance companies aged 30 and up from all over Israel. The festival's artistic director is Ze'ev Keren.

The first festival, which took place in 2010 commemorated 100 years of Israeli settlement in the Jezreel Valley. Specially for this occasion, choreographers Shlomo Haziz, Dganit Rom, and Ze'ev Keren put together the dance "Standing Guard", performed by Hora Rishonim Jerusalem, Misgav Contemporary Dance Company, and Alon Jezreel Contemporary Dance Company, who opened and concluded the festival. The dance has become a festival tradition, and opens and concludes every festival since.

Following the success of the first festival, Alon Jezreel Association, with the support of participating dance companies, the festival's hosts, and CEO of the Ministry of Culture and Sport Orly Frumann, decided to turn the festival into a Shavuot tradition in the Jezreel Valley. Since, dance companies annually partake in the festival, performing specially made dances put together with accordance to the [[theme (arts)|theme]] of the specific year's festival. The audience can enjoy a nice big serving of the beautiful land of Israel, vivid clothing, and the performances onstage.

Participating dance companies stay in [[Nahalal]] during the two days of the festival, and enjoy activities such as excursions in the Jezreel Valley, field activities, and contemporary dance-related workshops.

The festival in 2011 – "Chicken on the Yarkon Bridge", was dedicated to the 60s Israeli band "The Chickens" and trio "Gesher HaYarkon" in commemoration of 50 years to their contribution to Israeli culture. The guest of honor at the festival was The Chickens' founder [[Neomi Polani]].

The festival in 2012 – "Land of the Tsabar", was held at the Amphitheater in Nahalal, and hosted [[Serbia]]n contemporary dance company "Kod Tent", sponsored by Serbian Ambassador to Israel, who performed in traditional clothing accompanied by an orchestra playing [[Serbian folk music]].

The festival in 2013 "Coefficient of restitution" – was held at the event hall of the [[kibbutz]] [[Yif'at]]. 15 different contemporary dance companies partook and performed dances with the theme of the Jewish people from their formation until their restitution to the land of Israel. At the finale of the festival, which was held at the sports hall in Nahalal, the festival hosted a contemporary dance company from the [[Gaza envelope]], with the artistic directing of Gavri Levi.

'''John Champlin Gardner Jr.''' (July 21, 1933 – September 14, 1982) was an American novelist, essayist, literary critic and university professor. He is best known for his 1971 novel ''[[Grendel (novel)|Grendel]]'', a retelling of the [[Beowulf]] myth from the monster's point of view.

==Early life and education==
Gardner was born in [[Batavia, New York]]. His father was a lay preacher and dairy farmer, and his mother taught English at a local school. Both parents were fond of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and often recited literature together.  He was active in the Boy Scouts of America and achieved the Eagle Scout rank. As a child, Gardner attended public school and worked on his father's farm, where, in April 1945, his younger brother Gilbert was killed in an accident with a [[cultipacker]].  Gardner, who was driving the tractor during the fatal accident, carried guilt for his brother's death throughout his life, suffering nightmares and flashbacks.  The incident informed much of Gardner's fiction and criticism — most directly in the 1977 short story "Redemption," which included a fictionalized recounting of the accident as an impetus for artistic inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor = Allan Chavkin | title = Conversations with John Gardner | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-87805-422-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner began his university education at [[DePauw University]], but received his undergraduate degree from [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in 1955. He received his [[M.A.]] (1956) and [[Ph.D.]] (1958) from the [[University of Iowa]].&lt;ref name=pabook&gt;[http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Gardner__John.html Gardner, John Champlin, Jr.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127221427/http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Gardner__John.html |date=2013-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Distinguished Visiting Professor at the [[University of Detroit]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genesee.edu/gcc/gardner/ John C. Gardner Appreciation Page ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910132708/http://www.genesee.edu/gcc/gardner/ |date=2010-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
Gardner's best-known novels include ''[[The Sunlight Dialogues]]'', about a disaffected policeman asked to engage a madman fluent in classical mythology; ''[[Grendel (novel)|Grendel]]'', a retelling of the [[Beowulf]] legend from the monster's point of view, with an existential subtext; and ''October Light'', about an embittered brother and sister living and feuding with each other in rural Vermont (the novel includes an invented "trashy novel" the woman reads). This last book won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fictionawardwinners.com/reviews.cfm?id=277 October Light - Fiction Award Winners]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching and controversies==
Gardner was a lifelong teacher of fiction writing.  He was a favorite at the [[Bread Loaf Writers' Conference]].&lt;ref name=genesee&gt;[http://www.hollandlandoffice.com/06jg.html The Twenty - Five Things That Made Genesee County Famous: John Gardner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303050828/http://www.hollandlandoffice.com/06jg.html |date=2009-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His two books on the craft of writing fiction—''The Art of Fiction'' and ''On Becoming a Novelist''—are considered classics{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}.  He was famously obsessive with his work, and acquired a reputation for advanced craft, smooth rhythms, and careful attention to the continuity of the fictive dream.  His books nearly always touched on the redemptive power of art.

In 1978, Gardner's book of literary criticism, ''[[On Moral Fiction]]'', sparked a controversy that excited the mainstream media, vaulting Gardner into the spotlight with an interview on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' (May 16, 1978) and a cover story in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' (July, 1979).&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/john-gardner-pugilist-at-rest/ John Gardner, Pugilist at Rest]&lt;/ref&gt;  His judgments of contemporary authors—including such luminaries of American fiction as [[John Updike]] and [[John Barth]]—which could be termed either direct, courageous, or unflattering, depending on one's perspective—harmed his reputation among fellow writers and book reviewers. Gardner claimed that lingering animosity from critics of this book led to unflattering  reviews of what turned out to be his last finished novel, ''[[Mickelsson's Ghosts]]'', although literary critics later praised the book. What was seemingly lost in the furor over ''[[On Moral Fiction]]'' was Gardner's central thesis: that fiction should distinguish right from wrong.

[[Gore Vidal]] found the book, as well as Gardner's novels, sanctimonious and pedantic, and called Gardner the "late apostle to the lowbrows, a sort of Christian evangelical who saw Heaven as a paradigmatic American university."&lt;ref&gt;Vidal, Gore (1986) [http://www.randomhouse.com/boldtype/1000/vidal/essay.html "Calvino's Death."] From ''The Essential Gore Vidal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner inspired and, according to [[Raymond Carver]], sometimes intimidated his students. At [[Chico State College]] (where he taught from 1959 to 1962), when Carver mentioned to Gardner that he had not liked the assigned short story, [[Robert Penn Warren]]'s "Blackberry Winter," Gardner said, "You'd better read it again."  "And he wasn't joking", said Carver, who related this anecdote in his foreword to Gardner's book ''On Becoming a Novelist''.  In that foreword, he makes it clear how much he respected Gardner and also relates his kindness as a writing mentor.

In addition to Chico State, Gardner taught at [[Oberlin College]] (1958-1959), [[San Francisco State College]] (1962-1965), [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (1965-1974) and [[Binghamton University]] (1976-1982).&lt;ref name=genesee/&gt;

==Scholarship==
In 1977, Gardner published ''The Life and Times of Chaucer''.  In a review in the October 1977 issue of ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', Sumner J. Ferris pointed to several passages that were allegedly lifted either in whole or in part from work by other authors without proper citation.  Ferris charitably suggested that Gardner had published the book too hastily, but on April 10, 1978, reviewer [[Peter S. Prescott|Peter Prescott]], writing in ''[[Newsweek]]'', cited the ''Speculum'' article and accused Gardner of [[plagiarism]], a claim that Gardner met "with a sigh."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3394/the-art-of-fiction-no-73-john-gardner John Gardner, The Art of Fiction No. 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of the famous saying : "There are only two plots in all literature : a person goes on a journey, a stranger comes to town".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/05/06/two-plots/|title=There Are Only Two Plots: (1) A Person Goes on a Journey (2) A Stranger Comes to Town {{!}} Quote Investigator|last=garson|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health problems==
On December 10, 1977, Gardner was hospitalized with [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]].  He remained in [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] for about a month and a half. He struggled with substance abuse (alcoholism and smoking) late in his life.

==Family life==
Gardner married Joan Louise Patterson on June 6, 1953; the marriage, which produced children, ended in divorce in 1980.&lt;ref name=genesee/&gt;  Gardner married poet and novelist [[Liz Rosenberg]] in 1980, but this marriage also ended in divorce in 1982.&lt;ref name=pabook/&gt;

==Death==
Gardner was killed in a motorcycle accident about two miles from his home in [[Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania]] on Tuesday, September 14, 1982. [[Pennsylvania State Police|State Police]] said that at about 2:30 pm Gardner completed a curve on [[Pennsylvania Route 92|Route 92]] about {{Convert|3|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Oakland, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania|Oakland]] (41.986246, -75.601200). Passing the home of photographer John Wood, he lost control of his 1979 [[Harley-Davidson]], went into the dirt shoulder, struck the guard rail, and was thrown from the motorcycle, suffering blunt force trauma to his body from his handlebars. He was pronounced dead at Barnes-Kasson Hospital in Susquehanna.&lt;ref name= Schenectady1982&gt;{{Citation |title= John Gardner Killed on His Motorcycle  |author= [[United Press International]] |location= [[Oakland, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania|Oakland, Pennsylvania]] |newspaper= [[Schenectady Gazette]] |date= 15 September 1982 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EQwhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SHMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2070,4056176 |accessdate= 2010-09-03 |page= 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StPetersberg1982&gt;{{Citation |title= Novelist Gardner dies in crash |author= [[Associated Press]] |location= [[Binghamton, New York]] |newspaper= [[The Milwaukee Journal]] |date= September 15, 1982 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BWkaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2ykEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6948,3651651 |accessdate= 2010-11-09 |pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner's fiancée, Susan Thornton, stated that Gardner had been drinking the night before the accident.&lt;ref name=Thornton2000&gt;Thornton, Susan.

*[[Al-]]Kitab: a reference to itself in the [[Quran]], also called "Kitabullah", The Book of God. In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] the word refers to the [[Bible]].
*[[Kitab al-Aghani]]: ''The Book of Songs''

*[[Kitab al-Musiqi al-Kabir]]: ''Great Book of Music''
*[[Kitab al-Tabikh (disambiguation)|Kitab al-Tabikh]] - ''The Book of Dishes''
*[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]: ''Most Holy Book'', the central book of the [[Bahá'í Faith]].
*[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]: ''Book of Certitude'' regarded as [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s primary theological work.
*[[Kitab al Khazari]]: ''Book of the Khazars'', dialogues between the Khazar King and a religious sage, originally written in Arabic in Medieval Spain, but since translated into Hebrew and English, perhaps incorrectly so.  The original Arabic version has been lost, and therefore there is no way to validate the accuracy of the Hebrew translation, which occurred 700 years after the work was originally written in Arabic.

'''Koi and the Kola Nuts''' is a [[Nigeria|Nigerian]] [[folklore]] which takes place in an [[Igbo people|Igbo]] tribal village. When the son of the Chief named Koi decides to leave the village for many weeks, he then returns to the village only to find out his father the Chief had died and the villagers forget that the decessed chief even had a son. They accused Koi of being a liar. The villagers tell Koi to prove he's actually the son of the Chief by doing a series of tasks. One task was to retrieve a sac full of Kola nuts, and retrieve a golden ring that was thrown into the deep part of a river. If he succeeds they'll believe he is the son of a chief, and if he doesn't succeed they'll eat him.

Koi succeeds in all tasks, but doesn't do all the tasks by himself. With the help of a few jungle creatures they all save Koi from being eaten from the villagers. Koi proves himself to the village and becomes a Chief of the Igbo village.

[[File:Loza nemanjica.jpg|thumb|Nemanjić family tree from [[Visoki Dečani]] (ca. 1350).]]
The '''[[Nemanjić dynasty]]''' is depicted in a family tree [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] in several specimen of [[Byzantine art]] [[fresco]]es in medieval [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] monasteries. The scheme is known as the '''Nemanjić family tree''' (''loza Nemanjića'').{{sfn|Vizantološki institut|2007|p=311}} Examples include those of [[Gračanica monastery|Gračanica]] (1321), [[Patriarchal Monastery of Peć|Peć]] (ca. 1335), [[Visoki Dečani]] (ca. 1350), and [[Matejče Monastery|Matejić]] (ca. 1360).{{sfn|Đurić|1978}}

The Nemanjić family tree is also preserved from engravings, such as those of Studenica (1733), and [[Hristofor Žefarović]] (1741).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srpsko-nasledje.rs/sr-l/1998/05/article-10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Protagonize is an [[online community]] and [[self-publishing]] platform, launched in December, 2007 by creator Nick Bouton &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/person/nick-bouton|title=Nick Bouton on Crunch Base|publisher=Crunch base |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a home for [[Choose Your Own Adventure]]-style branching stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kyllo|first=Blaine|title=Web community spins Protagonize's yarns|url=https://www.straight.com/life/web-community-spins-protagonizes-yarns|newspaper=straight.com|date=Jul 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riley|first=Duncan|title=Protagonize Is A Good Read, Help Write "FriendFeed Fan"|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/572/protagonize-is-a-good-read-help-write-friendfeed-fan/|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=THE INQUISITR|date=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after launch, the site began to allow for linear narrative as well, and has since expanded to include poetry, screenplays, and other forms of literature.

Following its subsequent growth, there has been an increasing focus on the community aspect of the site, with features such as groups and writing circles being added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plus |url=http://www.protagonize.com/help/about |title=About Protagonize on Protagonize, a creative writing community |publisher=Protagonize.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008 Protagonize was selected as a finalist in the 2008 Canadian New Media Awards for "Excellence in Social Media Websites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Admin|title=Excellence in Social Media Websites|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/winners-at-the-canadian-new-media-awards-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009 Protagonize was one of seven local BC startups chosen to demo at Launch Party Vancouver 7 as part of the Startup Most Likely to Succeed competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Admin|title=Launch Part Vancouver 7 Companies Announced|url=http://blog.bootuplabs.com/2009/05/12/launch-party-vancouver-7-companies-announced/|publisher=Bootup Labs Blog|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Rob|title=Seven for LPV7 announced|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/seven-for-lpv7-announced|publisher=TECHVIBES|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one published book started out life as a story on Protagonize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heighway|first=Tricia|title=Paddytum|year=2010|publisher=Hirst Publishing|isbn=978-0956641731|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Paddytum-Tricia-Heighway/dp/0956641733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boog|first=Jason|title=Tricia Heighway: Digital Writer Spotlight|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/appnewser/tricia-heighway-digital-writer-spotlight_b1101|publisher=APP NEWSER|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2017, Protagonize closed down due to stagnant user growth and declining revenue from advertising and donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bouton|first=Nick|title=The End of the Road|url=http://blog.protagonize.com/2017/05/04/the-end-of-the-road/|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5966">[[File:Nazimova A doll's house.jpg|thumb|Scene from ''A Doll's House'', a 1922 silent film starring Alla Nazimova and Alan Hale, Sr. The author of the original play, [[Henrik Ibsen]], was an influential exponent of realism in the theatre.]]'''Realism''' in the [[theatre]] was a general [[Art movement|movement]] that began in the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th-century theatre]], around the 1870s, and remained present through much of the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]]. It developed a set of dramatic and theatrical [[Dramatic convention|conventions]] with the aim of bringing a greater fidelity of real life to texts and performances. Part of [[Realism (arts)|a broader artistic movement]], it includes [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] and [[Socialist realism]].

Russia's first professional playwright, [[Aleksey Pisemsky]], along with [[Leo Tolstoy]] (in his ''[[The Power of Darkness]]'' of 1886), began a tradition of psychological realism in Russia. A new type of acting was required to replace the declamatory conventions of the [[well-made play]] with a technique capable of conveying the speech and movements found in the domestic situations of [[everyday life]]. This need was supplied by the innovations of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]], founded by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]].&lt;ref name=HartnollFound2003&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Hartnoll, Phyllis |editor2=Found, Peter |title=The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre| year=2003| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=0-19-282574-7 | pages=341, 409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the subtle expression of emotion in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' through everyday small-talk had initially gone unappreciated in a more traditionally conventional production in St Petersburg, a new staging by the Moscow Art Theatre brought the play and its author, as well as the company, immediate success.&lt;ref name=Esslin-2003&gt;Esslin (2003), pp. 353-356&lt;/ref&gt; A logical development was to take the revolt against theatrical artifice a step further in the direction of naturalism, and Stanislavski, especially in his production of [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''[[The Lower Depths]]'', helped this movement achieve international recognition.&lt;ref name=HartnollFound2003/&gt; The Moscow Art Theatre's ground-breaking productions of plays by Chekhov, such as ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', in turn influenced [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]. Stanislavski went on to develop his 'system', a form of [[actor training]] that is particularly well-suited to psychological realism.

19th-century realism is closely connected to the development of modern drama, which, as Martin Harrison explains, "is usually said to have begun in the early 1870s" with the "middle-period" work of the Norwegian dramatist [[Henrik Ibsen]]. Ibsen's realistic drama in prose has been "enormously influential."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (1998), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[opera]], ''[[verismo]]'' refers to a post-Romantic Italian tradition that sought to incorporate the Naturalism of Émile Zola and Henrik Ibsen. It included realistic – sometimes sordid or violent – depictions of contemporary everyday life, especially the life of the lower classes. 

== Added to Realism ==
3D details were added by 1800. By 1850 settings, costumes and details became historically accurate and had more logic to the plays.

==Stanislavski's distinction==
As part of a strategic argument in his day, Stanislavski used the term "psychological realism" to distinguish his [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] of acting from his own [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalistic]] early stagings of the plays of [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Maxim Gorky]], and others. Jean Benedetti argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Naturalism, for him, implied the indiscriminate reproduction of the surface of life. Realism, on the other hand, while taking its material from the real world and from direct observation, selected only those elements which revealed the relationships and tendencies under the surface. The rest was discarded.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (2005), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As used in critical literature today, however, the term Naturalism has a broader scope than that, within which all of Stanislavski's work falls. In this broader sense, Naturalism or "psychological realism" is distinct both from [[Socialist realism]] and the critical realism developed by the [[epic theatre]] of [[Bertolt Brecht]].

[[File:Writing on a grain of rice.jpg|thumb|A person writing on a grain of rice.]]
'''Rice writing''' is the art and skill of being able to write small enough to write on a grain of [[rice]].

==History==
Rice writing originated in Ancient [[Anatolia]] in Turkey and India. Many rituals and rites use rice as a medium, but at some point in ancient [[Anatolia]] artisans who were skilled in making miniature paintings decided to turn their skill to making art with what had always been an ancient symbol of prosperity, the oldest example of which lies in [[Topkapi Palace]] in Istanbul, Turkey. The artisans would inscribe messages or names on a single grain of rice after it was treated and polished. Grains that were long and flat were favorites as they offered proper surfaces for writing. Apart from Turkey, India also had a large number of  artisans skilled in making miniature art including rice art.

==Rice art Symbolism==
Rice art is considered to bring good luck hence some of its most popular forms is good luck pendants, hope bracelets and cell phone charms.

==Rice art and Rice jewelry today==
[[File:Grain of rice necklace-2.jpg|thumb|A necklace containing a grain of rice with the name "Filip" written on it.]]
Within time rice writing and rice art evolved, soon creating rice jewelry where the rice grain was enclosed in a vial with a liquid/oil that magnifies the individual grain making it easier to appreciate the painstaking and intricate details. This went further with rice jewelry like good luck pendants, charm bracelets, anklets and earrings. In modern times most of these artisans and artists set up shop with street side stalls where they can personally write your message or name on a rice grain while displaying their wares and hard work.

==Technique==
Most modern day rice writers use the following tools:  
#Common long grain white rice:  This rice is a flat cylinder shape.  Because it is flat it provides two wide surfaces for writing.
#Sharp utility knife:  This is used to scrape the rice slightly to remove ridges to provide a smooth surface for writing.  This scraping method can also be used to remove minor mistakes. 
#[[Clay]]:  Some people use a utility gripper clay and others use a modeling clay.  The clay is used to hold the rice in place while performing the writing.
#[[Technical pen]]:  This is a drawing pen with an ultra-fine tip.  Most pens used are either size .18 (4x0) or .13 (6x0).  These can be purchased online, or at some arts and crafts stores.
#Waterproof Ink: This ink is sold with the technical pen.

Once the rice writing is complete, it is usually preserved in a small vial of liquid/oil.  Many craftsman mount these vials into [[jewelery]] such as necklaces, bracelets and key chains.

'''''Saint Jerome in His Study''''' is a [[fresco]] by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], executed in 1480 and located in the [[church of Ognissanti]], [[Florence]].

The work was commissioned by the [[Amerigo Vespucci|Vespucci]] family together with a ''[[St. Augustine (Botticelli)|Saint Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Sandro Botticelli]]. Both depicted two Doctors of the Church in their studies, with a number of objects which should mark their role as precursors of [[humanism]]. They decorated the area next to the choir, which was demolished in the 18th century. In that occasion the two frescoes were removed and placed in the nave. Part of the annexed frame and the inscriptions were lost.

==Description==

While Botticelli adopted a more expressive composition in his ''[[Saint Augustine]]'' (inspired by [[Andrea del Castagno]]'s works), Ghirlandaio created a more serene and conventional figure, concentrating instead on the [[still life]] of the objects exposed on the writing desk and the shelves behind [[Saint Jerome|Jerome]]. In this, he was perhaps inspired by northern European models, such as  [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (van Eyck)|Saint Jerome in His Study]]'' which was in the collections of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]].

Jerome is portrayed with his head resting on one hand, while writing with the other. This was the same posture chosen by Jan van Eyck. The open books and the cartouches, with [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letters, correspond to his activity as translator of the [[Bible]]. On the writing desk is the date (MCCCCLXXX), as well as a sealed letter, glasses, two inkwells (with drops of ink near them), scissors and a candle holder. The desk is covered by an oriental carpet, a luxurious object often depicted by Ghirlandaio, and perhaps also inspired by [[Flemish painting|Netherlandish painters]]. The objects on the shelves include a [[cardinal hat]], two pharmacist vases, a cylindrical case,  a necklace, a purse, some fruit, two transparent glass bottles and an hourglass.

The light comes from the upper right corner, producing a well defined shadow of the saint on the drapery behind him; but also from the foreground, illuminating the objects on the desk.

[[File:Al Hodge Don Hastings Captain Video.JPG|thumb|275px|A scene from the early American science fiction television program ''[[Captain Video]]'' which aired from 1949 to 1955]]

[[Science fiction]] first appeared in [[television program]]ming in the late 1930s, during what is called the [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]]. [[Special effects]] and other production techniques allow creators to present a living visual image of an imaginary world not limited by the constraints of reality.

==Science fiction television production process and methods==
The need to portray imaginary settings or characters with properties and abilities beyond the reach of current reality obliges producers to make extensive use of specialized techniques of television production.

Through most of the 20th century, many of these techniques were expensive and involved a small number of dedicated craft practitioners, while the reusability of props, models, effects, or animation techniques made it easier to keep using them. The combination of high initial cost and lower maintenance cost pushed producers into building these techniques into the basic concept of a series, influencing all the artistic choices.

By the late 1990s, improved technology and more training and cross-training within the industry made all of these techniques easier to use, so that directors of individual episodes could make decisions to use one or more methods, so such artistic choices no longer needed to be baked into the series concept.

===Special effects===
{{Main article|Special effect}}
[[File:Magicam-patent.png|thumb|301px|For the series ''[[The Starlost]]'', the Magicam, a servo controlled dolly along with a secondary periscope camera filming a model background, was designed by [[Douglas Trumbull]]. However, the system did not work reliably and [[Chroma key|blue screen]] effects were used.&lt;ref name="sf"&gt;{{cite book|title=Science Fiction Television Series|author1=Mark Phillips |author2=Frank Garcia |publisher=McFarland}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Special effects (or "SPFX") have been an essential tool throughout the history of science fiction on television: small explosives to simulate the effects of various [[raygun]]s, [[squib (explosive)|squib]]s of blood and gruesome prosthetics to simulate the monsters and victims in horror series, and the [[wire-flying]] entrances and exits of [[George Reeves]] as [[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Superman]].

The broad term "special effects" includes all the techniques here, but more commonly there are two categories of effects. [[Visual effects]] ("VFX") involve photographic or digital manipulation of the onscreen image, usually done in [[post-production]]. Mechanical or [[physical effects]] involve props, pyrotechnics, and other physical methods used during [[principal photography]] itself. Some effects involved a combination of techniques; a ray gun might require a pyrotechnic during filming, and then an optical glowing line added to the film image in post-production. [[Stunt]]s are another important category of physical effects. In general, all kinds of special effects must be carefully planned during [[pre-production]].

===Computer-generated imagery===
{{Main article|Computer-generated imagery}}

''[[Babylon 5]]'' was the first series to use [[computer-generated imagery]], or "CGI", for all exterior space scenes, even those with characters in space suits. The technology has made this more practical, so that today models are rarely used. In the 1990s, CGI required expensive processors and customized applications, but by the 2000s (decade), computing power has pushed capabilities down to personal laptops running a wide array of software.

===Models and puppets===
{{Main article|Scale model|Puppet}}

[[Scale model|Models]] have been an essential tool in science fiction television since the beginning, when [[Buck Rogers]] took flight in spark-scattering spaceships wheeling across a matte backdrop sky. The original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' required a staggering array of models; the [[Starship Enterprise|USS ''Enterprise'']] had to be built in several different scales for different needs. Models fell out of use in filming in the 1990s as CGI became more affordable and practical, but even today, designers sometimes construct scale models which are then digitized for use in animation software.

Models of characters are [[puppet]]s. [[Gerry Anderson]] created a series of shows using puppets living in a universe of models and miniature sets, notably ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''. ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' depicted an alien living in a family, while ''[[Farscape]]'' included two puppets as regular characters. In ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', the [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] characters are puppets in scenes where they are sitting, standing, or lying down. In ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', the characters of [[Crow T. Robot]] and [[Tom Servo]], two of the show's main (and most iconic) characters, are puppets constructed from random household items.

===Animation===
{{Main article|Animation}}
{{See also|Anime}}
[[File:Kuha2053108.JPG|thumb|Robot characters from the Japanese science fiction television series  ''[[Ganbare!! Robocon]]''  were used to decorate this train car.]]
As animation is completely free of the constraints of gravity, momentum, and physical reality, it is an ideal technique for science fiction and fantasy on television. In a sense, virtually all animated series allow characters and objects to perform in unrealistic ways, so they are almost all considered to fit within the broadest category of speculative fiction (in the context of awards, criticism, marketing, etc.) The artistic affinity of animation to [[comic books]] has led to a large amount of [[superhero]]-themed animation, much of this adapted from comics series, while the impossible characters and settings allowed in animation made this a preferred medium for both [[fantasy]] and for series aimed at young audiences.

Originally, animation was all hand-drawn by artists, though in the 1980s, beginning with ''[[Captain Power]]'', computers began to automate the task of creating repeated images; by the 1990s, hand-drawn animation became defunct.

====Animation in live-action====
In recent years as technology has improved, this has become more common, notably since the development of the Massive software application permits producers to include hordes of non-human characters to storm a city or space station. The robotic [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylons]] in the new version of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' are usually animated characters, while the [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] in ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' are animated when they are shown walking around or more than one is on screen at once.

==Science fiction television economics and distribution==
In general, science fiction series are subject to the same financial constraints as other television shows. However, high production costs increase the financial risk, while limited audiences further complicate the business case for continuing production. ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' was the first television series to cost more than $100,000 per episode, while ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' was the first to cost more than $1 million per episode.

The innovative nature of science fiction means that new shows cannot rely on predictable market-tested formulas like [[legal drama]]s or [[sitcom]]s; the involvement of creative talent outside the Hollywood mainstream introduces more variables to the budget forecasts.

In the past, science fiction television shows have maintained a family friendly format that rendered them suitable for all ages, especially children, as the majority of them were of the action-adventure format. This enabled merchandising such as toy lines, animated cartoon adaptations, and other licensing. However, many modern shows include a significant amount of adult themes (such as sexual situations, nudity, profanity and graphic violence) rendering them unsuitable for young audiences, and severely limiting the remaining audience demographic and the potential for merchandising.

The perception, more than the reality, of science fiction series being cancelled unreasonably is greatly increased by the attachment of fans to their favorite series, which is much stronger in [[science fiction fandom]] than it is in the general population. While mainstream shows are often more strictly episodic, where ending shows can allow viewers to imagine that characters live happily, or at least normally, ever after, science fiction series generate questions and loose ends that, when unresolved, cause dissatisfaction among devoted viewers. Creative settings also often call for broader story arcs than is often found in mainstream television, requiring science fiction series many episodes to resolve an ongoing major conflict. Science fiction television producers will sometimes end a season with a dramatic [[cliffhanger]] episode to attract viewer interest, but the short-term effect rarely influences financial partners. ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]'' is one of many shows ending with a cliffhanger scene that left critical questions open when the series was cancelled.

==Media fandom==
{{Main article|Media fandom}}
{{See also|science fiction fandom|Trekkie}}
[[File:Star Trek Federation Officers.jpg|thumb|px=250|Fans at a science fiction convention dressed as characters from ''[[Star Trek]]'']]
One of the earliest forms of media fandom was [[Star Trek fandom]]. Fans of the series became known to each other through the [[science fiction fandom]]. In 1968, [[NBC]] decided to cancel ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. [[Bjo Trimble]] wrote letters to contacts in the National Fantasy Fan Foundation, asking people to organize their local friends to write to the network to demand the show remain on the air. Network executives were overwhelmed by an unprecedented wave of correspondence, and they kept the show on the air. Although the series continued to receive low ratings and was canceled a year later, the enduring popularity of the series resulted in [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] creating a set of movies, and then a new series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', which by the early 1990s had become one of the most popular dramas on American television.

Although somewhat smaller, ''[[Doctor Who]]'' fandom considerably predates ''Star Trek'' fandom. Meanwhile, ''Star Trek'' fans continued to grow in numbers, and began organizing conventions in the 1970s. No other show attracted a large organized following until the 1990s, when ''[[Babylon 5]]'' attracted both ''Star Trek'' fans and a large number of literary SF fans who previously had not been involved in media fandom. Other series began to attract a growing number of followers.

In the late 1990s, a market for celebrity autographs emerged on [[eBay]], which created a new source of income for actors, who began to charge money for autographs that they had previously been doing for free. This became significant enough that lesser-known actors would come to conventions without requesting any appearance fee, simply to be allowed to sell their own autographs (commonly on publicity photos). Today most events with actor appearances are organized by commercial promoters, though a number of fan-run conventions still exist, such as [[Toronto Trek]] and [[Shore Leave (convention)|Shore Leave]].

The 1985 series ''[[Robotech]]'' is most often credited as the catalyst for the Western interest in anime. The series inspired a few fanzines such as ''Protoculture Addicts'' and ''Animag'' both of which in turn promoted interest in the wide world of anime in general. Anime's first notable appearance at SF or comic book conventions was in the form of video showings of popular anime, untranslated and often low quality VHS bootlegs. Starting in the 1990s, [[anime]] fans began organizing conventions. These quickly grew to sizes much larger than other science fiction and media conventions in the same communities; many cities now have anime conventions attracting five to ten thousand attendees. Many anime conventions are a hybrid between non-profit and commercial events, with volunteer organizers handling large revenue streams and dealing with commercial suppliers and professional marketing campaigns.

For decades, the majority of science fiction media fandom has been represented by males of all ages and for most of its modern existence, a fairly diverse racial demographic. The most highly publicized demographic for science fiction fans is the male adolescent; roughly the same demographic for American [[comic book]]s. Female fans, while always present, were far fewer in number and less conspicuously present in fandom. With the rising popularity of fanzines, female fans became increasingly vocal. Starting in the 2000s (decade), genre series began to offer more prominent female characters. Many series featured women as the main characters with males as supporting characters. ''[[True Blood]]'' is an example. Also, such shows premises moved away from heroic [[Action (fiction)|action-adventure]] and focused more on characters and their relationships. This has caused the rising popularity of [[fanfiction]], a large majority of which is categorized as [[slash fanfiction]]. Female fans comprise the majority of fanfiction writers.

U.S. television science fiction  has produced  ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' and its various spin-off shows of the ''[[Star Trek|Star Trek franchise]]'',  ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]],''  ''[[The X-Files]],'' and many others.

===British television science fiction===
{{Main article|British television science fiction}}

'''British television science fiction''' began in 1938 when the broadcast medium was in its infancy with the transmission of a partial adaptation of Karel Čapek's [[R.U.R.]]. Despite an occasionally chequered history, popular programmes in the genre have been produced by both the [[BBC]] and the largest commercial channel, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. ''[[Doctor Who]]'' is listed in the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the longest-running [[science fiction]] television show in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Canadian science fiction television===
{{Main article|Canadian science fiction television}}

Science fiction in [[Canada]] was produced by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] as early as the 1950s. In the 1970s, [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] produced ''[[The Starlost]]''. In the 1980s, Canadian animation studios including [[Nelvana]], began producing a growing proportion of the world market in animation.

In the 1990s, Canada became an important player in live action speculative fiction on television, with dozens of series like ''[[Forever Knight]]'', ''[[Robocop: The Series|Robocop]]'', and most notably ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''. Many series have been produced for youth and children's markets, including ''[[Deepwater Black]]'' and ''[[MythQuest]]''.

In the first decade of the 21st century, changes in provincial tax legislation prompted many production companies to move from Toronto to [[Vancouver]]. Recent popular series produced in Vancouver include ''[[The Dead Zone (TV series)|The Dead Zone]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'', ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', ''[[The 4400]]'', ''[[Sanctuary (TV series)|Sanctuary]]'' and the reimagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''.

Because of the small size of the domestic television market, most Canadian productions involve partnerships with production studios based in the United States and Europe. However, in recent years, new partnership arrangements are allowing Canadian investors a growing share of control of projects produced in Canada and elsewhere.

===Australian science fiction television===
{{Main article|Australian science fiction television}}

Australia's best known Science Fiction series was ''[[Farscape]]''; made with American co-production, it ran from 1999 to 2003. Early series made in the 1960s included ''[[The Interparis]]'' (1968) ''[[Vega 4 (TV series)|Vega 4]]'' (1967), and ''[[Phoenix Five]]'' (1970).  A significant proportion of Australian produced Science Fiction programmes are made for the teens/young Adults market, including ''[[The Girl from Tomorrow]]'', the long-running ''[[Mr. Squiggle]]'', ''[[Halfway Across the Galaxy and Turn Left]]'', ''[[Ocean Girl]]'', ''[[Crash Zone]]'', ''[[Watch This Space]]'' and ''[[Spellbinder (TV series)|Spellbinder]]''.

Other series like ''[[Time Trax]]'', ''[[Roar (U.S. TV series)|Roar]]'', and ''[[Space: Above and Beyond]]'' were filmed in Australia, but used mostly US crew and actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magicdragon.com/UltimateSF/tv.html|title=TV page of ULTIMATE SCIENCE FICTION WEB GUIDE|first=Jonathan Vos|last=Post|website=www.magicdragon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese television science fiction===
{{Main article|History of anime|Tokusatsu}}
Japan has a long history of producing science fiction series for television. Some of the most famous are [[anime]] such as [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s ''[[Astro Boy]]'', the [[Super Robot]]s such as [[Mitsuteru Yokoyama]]'s ''[[Tetsujin 28-go]]'' (''[[Gigantor]]'') and [[Go Nagai]]'s ''[[Mazinger Z]]'', and the [[Real Robot]]s such as [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]]'s ''[[Gundam]]'' series and [[Shōji Kawamori]]'s ''[[Macross]]'' series.

Other primary aspects of Japanese science fiction television are the [[superhero fiction|superhero]] ''[[tokusatsu]]'' (a term literally meaning [[special effects]]) series, pioneered by programs such as ''[[Moonlight Mask]]'' and ''[[Planet Prince]]''. The [[suitmation]] technique has been used in long running franchises include [[Eiji Tsuburaya]]'s [[Ultra Series]], [[Shotaro Ishinomori]]'s [[Kamen Rider Series]], and the [[Super Sentai]] Series.

In addition, several [[Japanese television drama|dramas]] utilize science fiction elements as framing devices, but are not labeled as "tokusatsu" as they do not utilize actors in full body suits and other special effects.

===Continental European science fiction series===

==== Northern European series ====
Among the notable German language productions is  ''[[Lexx]]'' and {{lang|de|[[Raumpatrouille]]}}, a German series first broadcast in 1966. Movies by [[Rainer Erler]], include the miniseries {{lang|de|[[Das Blaue Palais]]}}.&lt;br&gt;
''[[Star Maidens]]'' (1975, aka "Medusa" or "Die Mädchen aus dem Weltraum") was a British-German coproduction of pure SF. Danish television broadcast the children's TV-series ''[[Crash (1984 TV series)|Crash]]'' in 1984 about a boy who finds out that his room is a space ship.

Early Dutch television series were ''[[:nl:Morgen gebeurt het|Morgen gebeurt het]]'' (Tomorrow it will happen), broadcast from 1957 to 1959, about a group of Dutch space explorers and their adventures, ''De duivelsgrot'' (The devil's cave), broadcast from 1963 to 1964, about a scientist who finds the map of a cave that leads to the center of the earth and ''Treinreis naar de Toekomst'' (Train journey to the future) about two young children who are taken to the future by robots who try to recreate humanity, but are unable to give the cloned humans a soul. All three of these television series where aimed mostly at children.

Later television series were ''Professor Vreemdeling'' (1977) about a strange professor who wants to make plants speak and ''[[:nl:Zeeuws Meisje (televisie)|Zeeuws Meisje]]'' (1997) a nationalistic post-apocalyptic series where the Netherlands has been built full of housing and the highways are filled with traffic jams. The protagonist, a female superhero, wears traditional folkloric clothes and tries to save traditional elements of Dutch society against the factory owners.

==== Italian series ====
Italian TV shows include ''[[A come Andromeda]]'' (1972) which was a remake of 1962 [[BBC]] miniseries ''[[A for Andromeda]]'' (from the novels of Hoyle and Elliott), ''Geminus'' (1968), ''[[Il segno del comando]]'' (1971), ''[[Gamma (miniseries)|Gamma]]'' (1974) and ''La traccia verde'' (1975).

Another French-produced science fiction series was the [[new age]] animated series {{lang|fr|Il était une fois... l'espace}} ({{lang-en|Once upon a time...space}}).  [[Anime-influenced animation]] includes a series of French-Japanese [[cartoon]]s/[[anime]], including such titles as ''[[Ulysses 31]]'' (1981), ''[[The Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'' (1982), and  ''[[Ōban Star-Racers]]'' (2006).

==== Spanish series ====
The first Spanish SF series was ''Diego Valor'', a 22 episode TV adaption of a radio show hero of the same name based on [[Dan Dare]], aired weekly between 1958 and 1959. Nothing was survived of this series, not a single still; it is not known if the show was even recorded or just a live broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jiménez|first=Jesús|title=Andreu Martín y Enrique Ventura resucitan a 'Diego Valor'|url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20130823/andreu-martin-enrique-ventura-resucitan-diego-valor/743062.shtml|website=rtve|language=es|date=23 August 2013|access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boix|first=Armando|title=La aventura interplanetaria de Diego Valor|url=http://www.ciencia-ficcion.com/series/sdiegovalor.htm|website=Ciencia-ficción.com|date=5 June 1999|language=es|access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueradeseries.com/diego-valor-una-aventura-en-espana-y-el-espacio/|title=Diego Valor: Una aventura en España y el Espacio|last=Agudo|first=Angel|date=July 2006|website=Fuera de Series|language=es|access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 60s were dominated by [[Chicho Ibáñez Serrador]] and [[Narciso Ibáñez Menta]], who adapted SF works from Golden Age authors and others to a series titled ''Mañana puede ser verdad''. Only 11 episodes were filmed. The 70s saw three important television films, ''Los pajaritos'' (1974), ''La Gioconda está triste'' (1977), and ''[[La cabina]]'' (1972), this last one, about a man who becomes trapped in a telephone booth, while passersby seem unable to help him, won the 1973 [[International Emmy Award]] for Fiction.&lt;ref name=Jimenez2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20120218/ciencia-ficcion-genero-tan-raro-cine-espanol-como-estimulante/498557.shtml|title=La ciencia ficción, un género tan raro en el cine español como estimulante|first=Jesús |last=Jiménez|access-date=13 February 2016|date=18 February 2012|language=es|website=rtve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series ''Plutón B.R.B.

==== Eastern European series ====
[[Serbia]] produced ''[[The Collector (Serbian TV series)|The Collector]]'' ({{lang|sr|Sakupljač}}), a science fiction television series based upon [[Zoran Živković (writer)|Zoran Živković's]] story, winner of a [[World Fantasy Award]]. Several science-fiction series were also produced in various European countries, and never translated into English.

'''Scottish Ballet''' is the national ballet company of Scotland and one of the four leading ballet companies of the United Kingdom, alongside the [[Royal Ballet]], [[English National Ballet]] and [[Birmingham Royal Ballet]].  Founded in 1969,&lt;ref name="West_in_OD_of_D"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.scottishballet.co.uk/about-us/company/history|title=scottishballet.co.uk|author1=|first=|author2=|publisher=Scottish Ballet|year=|isbn=|location=|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company is based in [[Glasgow]], the resident ballet company at the Glasgow [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow|Theatre Royal]] and from 2009 in their purpose-built ballet centre in [[Tramway (arts centre)|Tramway Arts Centre, Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=Move_to_Tramway&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/business/business-news/scottish-ballet-shifts-base-tramway-3080852 |title=Scottish Ballet shifts base to Tramway hub |date=17 July 2009 |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515213905/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/business/business-news/scottish-ballet-shifts-base-tramway-3080852 |archivedate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded by [[Peter Darrell]] and Elizabeth West as the '''Western Theatre Ballet''' in [[Bristol]] in 1957,&lt;ref name=West_in_OD_of_D/&gt; the company moved to Glasgow in 1969 and was renamed Scottish Theatre Ballet, changing to Scottish Ballet in 1974. A year later its home theatre became the Theatre Royal, Glasgow when Scottish Opera bought it and transformed it as the first national opera house in Scotland. The Company performs across Scotland, the UK and abroad, with strong classical technique at the root of all of its work.  Its broad repertory includes new versions of the classics, seminal pieces from the 20th century modern ballet canon, signature pieces by living choreographers and new commissions. As a national company, Scottish Ballet performs at theatres in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness and in smaller venues throughout Scotland. The company's long history of touring internationally includes visits to China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Portugal, Ireland and the rest of the UK. Scottish Ballet's many recent awards include the 2004 [[TMA Award]] for Outstanding Achievement in Dance in recognition of its modernisation programme and dynamic performances. Scottish Ballet's current artistic director [[Christopher Hampson]] joined the company in 2012.

Scottish Ballet is Scotland's national dance company. Its primary aim is to provide programmes of world-class dance performance and educational activity at all scales. Scottish Ballet presents a wide range of dance to audiences across Scotland, the UK and abroad – and employs 36 professional dancers, 41 staff and a part-time freelance orchestra of up to 70 musicians.

The Company provides dance classes and a variety of education initiatives, including work with children and adults of all ages and abilities, and the Associate Programme which encourages aspiring young dancers to train for a career in the industry. Scottish Ballet also  has close links with Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, partnering the BA Modern Ballet and M.Mus (Pianist for Dance) degree courses.

Scottish Ballet was the first dance company in Europe to offer live audio description for the visually impaired, and maintains a programme of regular audio described performances throughout Scotland.&lt;ref name="scottishballet.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scottishballet.co.uk/about-us/company/artistic-vision|title=Our Legacy - Scottish Ballet|website=Scottish Ballet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seven''''' (stylized as '''''SE7EN''''') is a 1995 American [[neo-noir]] [[crime thriller|crime thriller film]] directed by [[David Fincher]] and written by [[Andrew Kevin Walker]]. It stars [[Brad Pitt]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[John C. McGinley]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], and [[Kevin Spacey]]. It tells the story of David Mills (Pitt), a detective who partners with the retiring William Somerset (Freeman) to track down a [[serial killer]] (Spacey) who uses the [[seven deadly sins]] as a motif in his murders.

The screenplay was influenced by the time Walker spent in [[New York City]] trying to make it as a writer. Principal photography took place in [[Los Angeles]], with the last scene filmed near [[Lancaster, California]]. The film's budget was $33 million.

Released on September 22, 1995, by [[New Line Cinema]], ''Seven'' was the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year, grossing over $327 million worldwide.&lt;ref name=BOM/&gt; It was well received by critics, who praised the film's darkness, brutality and themes. The film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the [[68th Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]''.

==Plot==
Soon-to-retire detective William Somerset is partnered with short-tempered but idealistic David Mills, who has recently moved to the city with his wife Tracy. Tracy confides to Somerset that she is pregnant and has yet to tell Mills, as she is unhappy with the city and feels it is no place to raise a child. Somerset sympathizes, having had a similar situation with his ex-girlfriend many years earlier, and advises her to tell Mills only if she plans to keep the child.

Somerset and Mills investigate a set of murders inspired by the [[seven deadly sins]]: a man forced to eat until his stomach ruptured, representing [[gluttony]], and a defense attorney killed after [[a pound of flesh]] was taken from him, representing [[greed]]. Clues at the murder scenes lead them to a suspect's apartment, where they find a third victim, a drug dealer and [[Child molestation|child molester]], strapped to a bed, emaciated but alive, representing [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]]. Daily photographs of the victim, taken over a year, show the crimes were planned far in advance.

The detectives use library records to identify a [[John Doe]] and track him to his apartment. Doe flees and Mills gives chase. Doe turns to hold Mills at gunpoint for a moment before escaping. The apartment contains hundreds of notebooks revealing Doe's psychopathy, as well as a clue to another murder. The detectives arrive too late to stop a man forced to kill a prostitute by raping her with a custom-made, bladed [[Strap-on dildo|strap-on,]] representing [[lust]]. The following day, they attend the scene of a fifth murder, a model whose face has been mutilated by Doe; she was given the option to call for help and live disfigured, or commit suicide by taking pills, representing [[pride]].

As Somerset and Mills return to the police station, Doe turns himself in, covered in the blood of an unidentified victim. Doe offers to take the detectives to the final two victims and confess to the murders, but only under specific terms, or he will [[Insanity defense|plead insanity]]. Somerset is wary, but Mills agrees.

The detectives follow Doe's directions to a remote desert location. Within minutes, a delivery van approaches. Mills holds Doe at gunpoint while Somerset intercepts the driver, who has been instructed to bring a box to them. Doe begins to taunt Mills by telling him how envious he was of his life with Tracy. Somerset opens the box and, in a sudden panic, warns Mills to stay back. Doe then says that his sin was [[envy]], and that Tracy died as a result of this; he also states that her head is in the box, and that she was pregnant. Despite Somerset's warnings, Mills shoots Doe, representing [[wrath]], and completing Doe's plan. Police converge and take the devastated Mills away.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
The primary influence for the film's screenplay came from [[Andrew Kevin Walker]]'s time spent in [[New York City]] while trying to make it as a screenwriter. "I didn't like my time in New York, but it's true that if I hadn't lived there I probably wouldn't have written ''Seven''."&lt;ref name="Montesano"&gt;{{cite news |last=Montesano |first=Anthony |title=''Seven''{{'s}} Deadly Sins |work=[[Cinefantastique]] |page=48 | date=February  1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He envisioned actor [[William Hurt]] as Somerset and named the character after his favorite author, [[W. Somerset Maugham]].&lt;ref name="Montesano"/&gt;

[[Jeremiah S. Chechik]] was attached to direct at one point.&lt;ref name="Montesano"/&gt; During pre-production, [[Al Pacino]] was considered for the Somerset role, but he decided to do ''[[City Hall (film)|City Hall]]''. [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]] turned down the role of Mills.  Washington later regretted turning down the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doty|first=Meriah|title=Denzel Washington regrets passing up ‘Seven’ and ‘Michael Clayton’|date=September 18, 2012|publisher=[[Yahoo! Movies]]|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/blogs/movie-talk/denzel-washington-regrets-passing-seven-michael-clayton-202631871.html|accessdate=May 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Edward|title=Denzel Washington Turned Down ‘Seven’ &amp; ‘Michael Clayton,’ Javier Bardem Passed On ‘Minority Report’|date=September 26, 2012|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2012/09/denzel-washington-turned-down-seven-michael-clayton-javier-bardem-passed-on-minority-report-105570/|accessdate=May 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ending of the screenplay, with the head in the box, was originally part of an earlier draft that New Line had rejected, instead opting for an ending that involved more traditional elements of a detective thriller film with more action-oriented elements. But when New Line sent David Fincher the screenplay to review for his interest in the project, they accidentally sent him the original screenplay with the head-in-the-box ending. At the time, Fincher had not read a script for a year and a half since the frustrating experience of making ''[[Alien 3]]''; he said, "I thought I'd rather die of [[colon cancer]] than do another movie".&lt;ref name="Taubin"&gt;{{cite news |last=Taubin |first=Amy |title=The Allure of Decay |work=[[Sight and Sound]] |page=24 |date=January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fincher eventually agreed to direct ''Seven'' because he was drawn to the script, which he found to be a "connect-the-dots movie that delivers about inhumanity. It's psychologically violent. It implies so much, not about why you did but how you did it".&lt;ref name="Taubin"/&gt; He found it more a "meditation on evil" rather than a "police procedural".

When New Line realized that they had sent Fincher the wrong draft, the President of Production, [[Michael De Luca]], met with Fincher and noted that there was internal pressure to retain the revised version; De Luca stated that if Fincher promised to produce the movie, they would be able to stay with the head-in-a-box ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/03/david-fincher-interview-transcript | title = David Fincher | first = Mark | last = Salsibury | date = January 18, 2009 | accessdate= June 26, 2012 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, producer Kopelson refused to allow the film to include the head-in-a-box scene.&lt;ref name="ending mottham"/&gt; Actor Pitt joined Fincher in arguing for keeping this original scene, noting that his previous film ''[[Legends of the Fall]]'' had its emotional ending cut after negative feedback from test audiences, and refusing to do ''Seven'' unless the head-in-the-box scene remained.&lt;ref name="pitt ending ew"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/09/16/brad-pitt-gwyneth-head-se7en/ | title = How Brad Pitt fought to keep Gwyneth's head in the box in 'Se7en' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = September 16, 2011 | accessdate= June 26, 2012 | first = Grady | last = Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fincher approached making ''Seven'' like a "tiny [[Genre film|genre movie]], the kind of movie [[William Friedkin|Friedkin]] might have made after ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''." He worked with cinematographer [[Darius Khondji]] and adopted a simple approach to the camerawork, which was influenced by the television show ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'', "how the camera is in the backseat peering over people's shoulder".&lt;ref name="Taubin"/&gt; Fincher allowed Walker on the set while filming for on-the-set rewrites.&lt;ref name="Montesano"/&gt; According to the director, "''Seven'' is the first time I got to carry through certain things about the camera&amp;nbsp;– and about what movies are or can be".&lt;ref name="Taubin"/&gt;

The crowded urban streets filled with noisy denizens and an oppressive rain that seems to fall without respite were integral parts of the film, as Fincher wanted to show a city that was "dirty, violent, polluted, often depressing. Visually and stylistically, that's how we wanted to portray this world. Everything needed to be as authentic and raw as possible." To this end, Fincher turned to production designer [[Arthur Max]] to create a dismal world that often eerily mirrors its inhabitants. "We created a setting that reflects the moral decay of the people in it", says Max. "Everything is falling apart, and nothing is working properly." The film's brooding, dark look was achieved through a chemical process called [[bleach bypass]], wherein the silver in the film stock was not removed, which in turn deepened the dark, shadowy images in the film and increased its overall tonal quality.

The 'head in a box' ending continued to worry the studio after filming was completed. After the first cut of the film was shown to the studio, they attempted to mitigate the bleakness of the ending by replacing Mills' wife's head with that of a dog, or by not having Mills fire on John Doe. However, both Fincher and Pitt continued to fight for the original ending.&lt;ref name="pitt ending ew"/&gt; The final scenes of Mills being taken away and Somerset's quote from Ernest Hemingway were filmed by Fincher after initial filming was complete as a way to placate the studio (the original intention was for the film to suddenly end after Mills shot John Doe).&lt;ref name="ending mottham"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Sundance Kids: How the Mavericks Took Back Hollywood | first = James | last = Mottham | year = 2007 | publisher = [[Faber and Faber]] | isbn =  0865479674 | pages =  153–155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title sequence===
Originally, Fincher planned the [[title sequence]] of the film to show Freeman's character buying a house in a remote country area and traveling back into the city. However, days before a [[test screening]], they had yet to film the sequence and had no budget to do it in that time. Fincher approached [[Kyle Cooper]] to suggest a replacement. Cooper recognized the amount of money used to make John Doe's notebooks (created by Clive Piercy and John Sabel),&lt;ref name="artofthetitle2"/&gt; and used the sequence to display them in a slideshow set to [[Nine Inch Nails]]' "[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]". The hand-drawn credits font was used to suggest that Doe had written the credits himself.&lt;ref name="empire title"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/david-fincher-fight-club-opening-credits/ | title = Anatomy Of An Opening Sequence: David Fincher's Seven | first = Phil | last = de Semlyen | date = October 9, 2015 | accessdate = April 9, 2018 | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The studio liked the sequence and suggested he stay with that. Fincher instead asked Cooper to "pretend we've never met and come back and propose something else", according to Cooper.&lt;ref name="empire title"/&gt; Cooper came up with a more detailed version of this photographic sequence: "The idea was that this is John Doe's job: he gets up, makes his books, plans his murders, drinks his tea."&lt;ref name="empire title"/&gt; Fincher liked this approach, but cautioned Cooper "Well, that would be neat, but that's kind of a 2D glimpse. Figure out a way for it to involve John Doe, to show that somewhere across town somebody is working on some really evil shit. I don't want it to be just flipping through pages, as beautiful as they are."&lt;ref name="artofthetitle"&gt;{{cite web|last=Perkins|first=Will|title=David Fincher: A Film Title Retrospective|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/david-fincher-a-film-title-retrospective/|work=[[Art of the Title]]|accessdate=September 8, 2012|date=August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper reworked the idea, working with Wayne Coe to create a storyboard for a live-action shot&lt;ref name="artofthetitle2"/&gt; and adding in filming along with photographs of the books, new props include film reels and additional notebooks, visual effects for the title credits, and elements inspired by Doe's behavior in the movie, such as cutting his fingertips.&lt;ref name="empire title"/&gt; Fincher liked this approach, and considered getting [[Mark Romanek]], the director of the "Closer" music video to produce the sequence, but Cooper insisted he direct it. Cooper was assisted by film editor [[Angus Wall]] and cinematographer [[Harris Savides]] in making the final title sequence.&lt;ref name="artofthetitle"/&gt; The filming took two days and five further weeks to edit.&lt;ref name="empire title"/&gt; The credits were hand-etched onto black [[scratchboard]] and manipulated by the camera, rather than using digital effects.&lt;ref name="artofthetitle2"/&gt; The final sequence used a remix of "Closer" created by the band [[Coil (band)|Coil]].&lt;ref name="artofthetitle2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/se7en/ | title = Se7en (1995) | first = Ben | last = Radatz | date = July 10, 2012 |  accessdate = April 9, 2018 | work = [[Art of the Title]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
''Seven'' was released on September 22, 1995, in 2,441 theaters where it grossed US$13.9&amp;nbsp;million on its opening weekend. It went on to gross $100.1&amp;nbsp;million in North America and $227.1&amp;nbsp;million in the rest of the world for a total of $327.3&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name= "boxoffice"&gt;{{cite news |title=Seven |publisher=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=seven.htm |accessdate=March 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; making ''Seven'' the seventh-highest-grossing film in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;The top six grossing films of 1995 were ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'', ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', ''[[GoldenEye]]'', ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' and ''[[Batman Forever]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
The film also spent 4 consecutive weeks in the top spot at the U.S. box office in 1995.

===Critical response===
The film was well received by critics and holds an 80% positive rating at the film-review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 71 critics with an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 7.8/10. Its consensus reads: "A brutal, relentlessly grimy shocker with taut performances, slick gore effects, and a haunting finale."&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite web|title=Seven|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/seven/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has a rating of 65 on Metacritic based on 22 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|title=Seven|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/se7en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Arnold, in ''[[The Washington Times]]'', praised the cast: "The film's ace in the hole is the personal appeal generated by Mr. Freeman as the mature, cerebral cop and Mr. Pitt as the young, headstrong cop. Not that the contrast is inspired or believable in itself. What gets to you is the prowess of the co-stars as they fill out sketchy character profiles."&lt;ref name= "Arnold"&gt;{{cite news |last=Arnold |first=Gary |title=Sinister ''Seven'' a killer of a thriller |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=September 22, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheila Johnston, in her review for ''[[The Independent]]'', praised Freeman's performance: "The film belongs to Freeman and his quiet, carefully detailed portrayal of the jaded older man who learns not to give up the fight."&lt;ref name= "Johnston"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=Sheila |title=Sin has seldom looked so good |work=[[The Independent]] |date=January 4, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Charisma, in a list of Spacey's greatest film performances for ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', wrote: "Spacey’s portrayal is a perfect balancing act: John Doe is detached from the murders he commits, yet deliberate and meticulous in his execution ...

===Accolades===
[[New Line Cinema]] re-released ''Seven'' in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California]], on Christmas Day and in New York City on December 29, 1995, in an attempt to generate [[Academy Award]] nominations for Freeman, Pitt, and Fincher, which was ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref name= "Cox"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cox |first=Dan |title=''Seven'' gets new dates for Oscar season |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=December 22, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novelization and comic books==
In 1995, a [[novelization]] with the same title was written by Anthony Bruno based on the original film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruno |first=Anthony |title=Seven: a novel by Anthony Bruno based on a screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker |year=1995 |publisher=New York: St. Martin's Paperbacks |isbn=0-312-95704-1 |page=248 |url=http://www.chipublib.org/search/details/cn/1246748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between September 2006 and October 2007, a series of seven comic books were published by [[Zenescope Entertainment]] with each of the seven issues dedicated to one of the seven sins. It told the story from the perspective of John Doe rather than the two homicide detectives as in the film, and gave Doe a backstory. Each issue included contributions by a group of creators independent of each other. All seven issues were collected in trade paperback form, released on January 15, 2008, as ''[[Seven (comic book)|SE7EN]]'', edited by  David Seidman and Ralph Tedesco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;old=1&amp;id=7216 Comic Book Resources.com Horrific sins: ''SE7EN" comes to comics this September]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mycomicshop.com/search?TID=660931 MyComicShop: Seven (2006 Se7en) comic books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The opening credit music is a spliced sample of an uncredited remix of the [[Nine Inch Nails]] song "[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]", available as "Closer (Precursor)", remixed by [[Coil (band)|Coil]], on the "Closer" single. The song during the end credits is [[David Bowie]]'s song "[[The Hearts Filthy Lesson]]", found on his album ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside]]''. The film's original score is by [[Howard Shore]].

{{About-distinguish|Social Practice as a minor psychological theory|Practice Theory}}

{{For|the art medium of Social Practice|Social practice (art)}}

'''Social practice''' is a theory within psychology that seeks to determine the link between practice and context within social situations. Emphasized as a commitment to change, social practice occurs in two forms: activity and inquiry. Most often applied within the context of human development, social practice involves knowledge production and the theorization and analysis of both institutional and intervention practices.&lt;ref&gt;Smolka, A. L. B. (2001). Social practice and social change: activity theory in perspective. Human Development, 44(6), 362-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background in psychology==
Through research, [[Sylvia Scribner]] sought to understand and create a decent life for all people regardless of geographical position, race, gender, and social class.&lt;ref&gt;Hedegaard, M. (1998). A cultural-historical approach to mind. Human Development, 41(3), 205-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Using anthropological field research and psychological experimentation, Scribner tried to dig deeper into human mental functioning and its creation through social practice in different societal and cultural settings. She therefore aimed to enact social reform and community development through an ethical orientation that accounts for the interaction of historical and societal conditions of different institutional settings with human social and mental functioning and development.

==Social practice as activity==
Social practice involves engagement with communities of interest by creating a practitioner-community relationship wherein there remains a focus on the skills, knowledge, and understanding of people in their private, family, community, and working lives.&lt;ref&gt;“What is social practice?” (n.d.). Retrieved April 25, 2013, from http://spiritstorelimerick.weebly.com/what-is-social-practice.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach to social practice, activity is used for social change without the agenda of research. Activity theory suggests the use of a system of participants that work toward an object or goal that brings about some form of change or transformation in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Hung, D., Tan, S. C., &amp; Koh, T. S. (2006). From traditional to constructivist epistemologies: a proposed theoretical framework based on activity theory for learning communities. Journal of Interactive Learning Research, 17(1), 37-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social practice as inquiry==
Within research, social practice aims to integrate the individual with his or her surrounding environment while assessing how context and culture relate to common actions and practices of the individual. Just as social practice is an activity itself, inquiry focuses on how social activity occurs and identifies its main causes and outcomes. It has been argued that research be developed as a specific theory of social practice through which research purposes are defined not by philosophical paradigms but by researchers' commitments to specific forms of social action.&lt;ref&gt;Herndl, C. G., &amp; Nahrwold, C. A. (2000). Research as social practice: a case study of research on technical and professional communication. Written Communication, 17(2), 158-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of interest==
===Education===
In education, social practice refers to the use of adult-child interaction for observation in order to propose intentions and gauge the reactions of others.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, D. W. (2010). Directions for studying early literacy as social practice. Language Arts, 88(2), 134-143.&lt;/ref&gt; Under social practice, [[literacy]] is seen as a key dimension of community regeneration and a part of the wider lifelong learning agenda.  In particular, literacy is considered to be an area of instruction for the introduction of social practice through social language and social identity. According to social practice in education, literacy and [[numeracy]] are complex  capabilities rather than a simple set of basic skills. Furthermore, adult learners are more likely to develop and retain knowledge, skills, and understanding if they see them as relevant to their own problems and challenges. Social practice perspectives focus on local literacies and how literacy practices are affected by settings and groups interacting around print.

===Literature===
As literature is repeatedly studied in education and critiqued in discourse, many believe that it should be a field of social practice as it evokes emotion and discussion of social interactions and social conditions. Those that believe literature may be construed as a form of social practice believe that literature and society are essentially related to each other. As such, they attempt to define specific sociological practices of literature and share expressions of literature as works comprising text, institution, and individual. Overall, literature becomes a realm of social exchange through fiction, poetry, politics, and history.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, P., Ferguson, P. P., &amp; Griswold, W. (Eds.). (1989). Literature and social practice, 1st Ed. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and social practice===

Social practice is also considered a medium for making art.

==History==
Originally conceived as a training program for connoisseurship by [[Sotheby's]] auction house in 1969, Sotheby's Institute of Art aims to provide students with education on the business of art while exploring both the scholarly and practical sides of the art world.

In 1995, Sotheby's Institute of Art – London was granted the status of an Affiliated Institution of the [[University of Manchester]]'s Department of Art History and Archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/degrees-on-offer-at-sothebys/96082.article|title="Degrees on Offer at Sotheby's", Times Higher Education, 13/11/1995|work="Degrees on Offer at Sotheby's", Times Higher Education, 13/11/1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2002, Sotheby's sold its Institute to a US-based information and educational services firm, [[Cambridge Information Group]] (CIG), which retains the Sotheby's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cig.com/portfolio/education/sothebys-institute-of-art/|title=Cambridge Information Group|work=Cambridge Information Group|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201215145/http://www.cig.com/portfolio/education/sothebys-institute-of-art/|archivedate=2014-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sotheby's Institute continues to have strong links with Sotheby's auction house, having members on the Sotheby's Institute of Art - London advisory board &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sothebysinstitute.com/About/Academic-Leadership/Tom_Christopherson_joins_Sothebys_Institute.aspx|title=Sotheby's Institute Academic Leadership News|work=Sotheby's Institute Academic Leadership News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202154808/http://www.sothebysinstitute.com/About/Academic-Leadership/Tom_Christopherson_joins_Sothebys_Institute.aspx|archivedate=2014-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and students having access to internships, auctions and exhibitions at [[Sotheby's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sothebysinstitute.com/Programmes/PLondon/PLMasterDegree/PLMArtBusiness/MAAB-Visits.aspx|title=Sotheby's Trainee Auctioneer Day|work=Sotheby's Trainee Auctioneer Day}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, the Institute broadened its course offerings in New York and in 2010 the New York Institute received degree-granting authority from the Regents of the State of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regents.nysed.gov/|title=Regents of the State of New York|work=Regents of the State of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been an accredited member of the [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]] since 1989. In 2013 Sotheby's Institute announced a partnership with the [[Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management]] at [[Claremont Graduate University]], establishing a new master's degree in Art Business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgu.edu/pages/4546.asp?item=6876|title=Claremont Graduate University Office of Communications|work=Claremont Graduate University Office of Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan T.D.

The Institute also began offering courses in mainland China in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/945955/sothebys-institute-of-art-beefs-up-its-offerings-in-china|title=Sotheby's Institute of Art Beefs Up Its Offerings in China, Blouin Artinfo, 16/08/13|work=Blouin Artinfo|accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2014 announced a partnership with [[Tsinghua University]] to offer a six-week international field study programme with a professional certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.artnet.com/in-brief/sothebys-institute-of-art-to-partner-with-tsinghua-university-5325|title=Sotheby's Institute of Art to Partner with Tsinghua University|work=Artnet|accessdate= 12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library==
The libraries on the London, New York and Los Angeles campuses collectively contain
more than 3 million volumes, 350 databases, 70 print subscriptions, and 126 serials—all of which are academic in nature and related to art and the art market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sothebysinstitute.com/news-and-events/news/spotlight-on-libraries/|title=Spotlight on Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Sotheby's auction house==
Sotheby's Institute of Art was founded by [[Sotheby's]] auction house in London in 1969. Initially, the Institute served as a training program for auction house employees and provided lessons in connoisseurship. Auction house experts and professionals often serve as Sotheby's Institute of Art faculty and guest speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sothebysinstitute.com/why-sothebys/our-faculty-and-guest-speakers/|title=Our Faculty {{!}} Sotheby's Institute of Art|website=www.sothebysinstitute.com|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now on permanent loan to Sotheby’s Institute of Art in London. Originally formed as a pedagogical handling tool for auction house specialists, the Collection today continues to support student enquiry. The Kiddell Collection is emblematic for the kind of in-situ access students have during their studies.

'''Southwark Street''' is a major street in [[Bankside]] in the [[London Borough of Southwark]], in [[London]] England, just south of the [[River Thames]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londontown.com/LondonStreets/southwark_street_553.html                                London guide to Southwark Street, SE1], LondonTown.com.&lt;/ref&gt; It runs between [[Blackfriars Road]] to the west and [[Borough High Street]] to the east. It also connects the access routes for [[London Bridge]], [[Southwark Bridge]] and [[Blackfriars Bridge]]. At the eastern end to the north is [[Borough Market]]. 

The road forms part of the A3200, which continues with [[Stamford Street]] to the west. 

== History ==

In April 1856, the [[St Saviour's District (Metropolis)|St Saviour's District Board]] petitioned the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] to create a new street to run between the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] terminus at [[London Bridge station]] and the [[West End of London|West End]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir Howard Roberts and Walter H. Godfrey (editors), [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=65327 Southwark Street], ''Survey of London: volume 22: Bankside (the parishes of St. Saviour and Christchurch Southwark)'', chapter 15, page 90, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; The street was the first to be made by the Board and was completed in 1864. It was driven across a densely occupied part of the parish and crosses older roads and streets which created oddly shaped plots for redevelopment. Its junction with Borough High Street is so gently curved that the transition between the streets leads to confusion and imprecision as to which is which and the street numbering and lack of a street name plate compounds this, the break between them occurs at the junction with Bedale Street on the north-side but at the south-side the street does not begin until after the 'fork' opposite Stoney Street, some 130 metres to the west. Under the street, a tunnel was constructed with side passages to carry utilities such as gas, water, and drainage pipes, together with [[telegraph]] wires for communication. This was an advanced feature for the time. 

[[File:South facade of Borough market on Southwark Street - geograph.org.uk - 1522143.jpg|thumb|South facade of Borough Market on Southwark Street]]
During the first decade of the street's existence, many large commercial buildings were built along the street. The Hop Exchange, of 1874, is the most notable building at the northern side filling most of the quadrant formed by the street and the railway viaduct. Built in the 1870s, the former [[Menier Chocolate Factory]] factory on Southwark Street was converted to an arts complex that incorporates an [[art gallery]], [[restaurant]], and [[theatre]], opening in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menierchocolatefactory.com/ Menier Chocolate Factory].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1932 Borough Market built a formal gateway with administrative offices at Nos 6 and 8. In 1958 the Trustees erected a small office building at the junction with Stoney Street 'St Margaret's House'. At No 110, the western-end of the street, is the headquarters of IPC Media at the 'Blue Fin Building' completed in 2007.

Under the railway bridge carrying trains to Blackfriars Station from the south some urban art work has been placed on the south-side, whilst on the north-side the word 'Bankside' has been placed in very large lettering occupying most of the wall against the pavement. This is part of the area and tourist branding as the relationship with the ancient district of [[Bankside]] is tenuous, the most that can be said is that Southwark Street defines the southernmost limit of Bankside.

The building on the south-west corner of the junction with Great Guildford Street is, unusually, numbered 59½.

[[Ian Davenport]]s' 2006 painting ''[[Poured Lines]]'' is displayed under the rail bridge at the western end of Southwark Street. It is the largest painting to be publicly displayed outdoors in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=BBC06&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5315186.stm|title=The big picture|date=5 September 2006|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Shanti Stupa, Dhauli 01.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Shanti Stupa at [[Dhauli]], where the song "Shiva Poojaku" was filmed]]
[[File:Pushpawati vof2.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Pushpawati River rushing out at the [[Valley of Flowers National Park]], where the song "Ghallu Ghallu" was shot]]
[[File:BhanuPriya-SwarnaKamalam.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Bhanu Priya's painting in the film]]
Meenakshi ([[Bhanupriya]]) and Savitri (Devilalita) are daughters of a [[Kuchipudi]] doyen,  Vedantam Seshendra Sharma. While a highly accomplished artist in his field, Seshendra Sharma is not well-off and has not been able to afford for his daughters, a conventional education. Both of them have achieved a respectable degree of proficiency — Savitri in Carnatic classical music and Meenakshi in classical dance.

Savitri is grateful for her knowledge and interest and looks forward to a life that will require her to hone her skills in the same art. Meenakshi, on the other hand, is bitter about the lack of opportunity that she feels in the field of classical dance in India and resolves to make a simpler and more pleasurable life for herself as soon as possible, while confiding her ambitions only to her sister.

Chandrasekhar ([[Daggubati Venkatesh|Venkatesh]]) is a tenant who has just moved in next door. He is a painter and is shown to be handling movie promotions as a large amount of his work. He develops an interest in the neighbors and tries to help them in whatever way he can, partly because of his (unconfessed) interest in Meenakshi and partly because of his interest in the art which seems to be slowly fading away from public life.

The rest of the film is largely built around Meenakshi's journey from skepticism to devotion in her pursuit of dance. Chandrasekhar is shown to be an important catalyst in this transformation. Meenakshi becomes an accomplished dancer through the direction of renowned Odissi dancer [[Sharon Lowen]], and gets the [[Fulbright Program|opportunity]] to go to the [[United States]] and perform. She learns of Chandrasekhar's love for her, and finally unites with Chandrasekhar, confessing her love for him as well.

'''''The Crowning of the Virtuous Hero''''' is a painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], painted between 1613 and 1614. Unsigned, it was commissioned by the St George Guild of Archers in [[Antwerp]] for their banqueting hall and is now in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister within the [[Schloss Wilhelmshöhe]] in [[Kassel]].

==Description==
It shows an ancient Roman general being crowned by [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] with laurels of victory and treading underfoot a bound barbarian and a personification of Discord (shown with snakes for hair). To his right is a [[genius (mythology)|genius]] of Harmony, who presents him with a bound bundle of arrows (symbolising peace). The figure on the right is also intended as the guardian of religion, due to the eternal fire shown on the altar beside the figure. Behind the altar is a red and white tricolour, referring to the ruling [[house of Habsburg]] and thus affirming the guild's loyalty to that house.

==History==
[[William VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]] acquired the painting between 1730 and 1760 to add to his collection of Dutch paintings at the Schloss Bellevue in Kassel's Oberneustadt or upper new town. The [[Peace of Tilsit]] in 1807 made Kassel the capital of the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], under [[Jerome Bonaparte]] - later that year Jerome's brother [[Napoleon I]] acquired the painting and assigned it to the imperial coronation hall in Paris. In 1813 general Czerniczew forced Jerome Bonaparte to flee and negotiations began for the return of this and other paintings confiscated by Napoleon. [[Jacob Grimm]] (then a legation secretary) played an instrumental part in gaining the return of the Rubens, which occurred in December 1815.

Between 1878 and 1943, the painting was in the Neue Galerie at the Schloss Bellevue. In 1943 the painting was moved to a store elsewhere - Kassel was a target for Allied bombing and the Schloss Wilhelmshöhe was severely damaged. In 1956 the painting was moved to emergency headquarters of the Landesmuseum until in April 1974 it returned to Kassel, initially in the Corps de Logis at the Schloss  Wilhelmshöhe.

'''''The Musician''''' (1662) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

The woman is looking at the viewer and according to art historian [[Walter Liedtke]], "spills out of her dress".&lt;ref name=Liedtke&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=jtnQ7PIT8mcC&amp;pg=PA328 Cat. no. 77] in ''Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art'' Volume I, by [[Walter Liedtke]], Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Liedtke goes on to make this a case for considering it a genre work rather than a portrait, comparing it with other scantily clad lute players that may have influenced the painter, such as the earlier works of [[Gerrit van Honthorst]] and contemporary work such as by [[Ferdinand Bol]]:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Femme accordant son luth.JPG|Honthorst, 1624
File:Gerrit van Honthorst - Het Concert.jpg|Honthorst, 1624
File:A Lady Playing the Lute (Ferdinand Bol) - Nationalmuseum - 18433.tif|Bol, 1654
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Liedtke wonders if it could possibly a portrait of the artist's wife, as has sometimes been claimed for the female pendant of a shepherd by Van der Helst that has often been claimed to be a self-portrait:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Bartholomeus van der Helst.jpg|Unknown woman as ''Granida'', 1660
File:Bartholomeus van der Helst 1613-1670 - Self Portrait as Daifilo.jpg|So-called self-portrait as ''Daifilo'', 1660
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This work is the only surviving painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art that was acquired before 1906 and after the initial purchase of 1871, and though it is officially recorded as entering the collection in 1873, Liedtke mentions that it was grouped as one of two paintings that came into the collection in 1872 after the initial 1871 purchase, but also via the same vice-president of the Board of Trustees [[William T. Blodgett]] and presumably therefore via his dealer Leon Gauchez.&lt;ref name=Liedtke/&gt; The other painting (accession number 73.1) was a double portrait by Carel de Moor, but it was deaccessioned in 1988.&lt;ref name=Liedtke/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofpaint00metr_2#page/209/mode/1up A Burgomaster of Leyden and His Wife]'', Oval, 46 x 36 3/8 inches, in the 1914 Metropolitan Museum of Art catalog, under "Karel van Moor", with a note that "the attribution has been questioned"&lt;/ref&gt;

The art historian J.J. de Gelder mentioned the lute shown in the painting is a [[theorbe]] and it rests on a [[viola de gamba]]. He found the landscape reminiscent of [[Jan Baptist Weenix]]. The Van der Helst scholar Judith van Gent dismisses both this painting and the Granida as a portrait of the artist's wife Anna du Pire based on the age of the painter and his wife at the time. She notes Liedtke's comparison to the other Dutch lute players in the MET collection, namely Vermeer's ''[[Woman with a Lute]]'', where the woman is also tuning the lute, and Gerard ter Borch's ''A Woman Playing the Theorbo-Lute and a Cavalier''. She wonders whether the act of tuning a lute used to have a meaning that is now lost on us. 
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Vermeer - Woman with a Lute near a window.jpg|Vermeer, 1662
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Vermeer was donated to the MET's collection in 1900, and the Ter Borch in 1914, both of which had been recently imported to the US, probably also based on the popularity at the time of this painting.

"'''Tithonus'''" is the tenth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]] of the American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on January 24, 1999. The episode was written by [[Vince Gilligan]], and directed by [[Michael W. Watkins]]. The episode is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "Tithonus" earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.2, being watched by 15.90 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received positive reviews.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully learns that she, but not Mulder, is being given a chance to prove her worth at the FBI, and—paired with a new partner—she investigates a crime scene photographer with an uncanny knack for arriving just in time to see his victims' final moments. What she does not expect, however, is for Death to play a role himself.

Vince Gilligan wrote "Tithonus" in an attempt to create a story wherein immortality is portrayed as scary. The episode was based on three different stories: [[Weegee|Arthur Fellig]], the Greek myth of [[Tithonus]], and the [[yellow fever]] epidemic in the 19th century. In addition, several of the scenes were filmed on the sets from ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', whose sets were located just across from ''[[The X-Files]]'' studios. The character of Alfred Fellig in "Tithonus" has thematically been compared to the Tithonus in [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s [[dramatic monologue]] [[Tithonus (poem)|of the same name]]. In addition, themes of immortality and escaping death were revisited in the [[The X-Files (season 8)|eighth season]] episode "[[The Gift (The X-Files)|The Gift]]".

==Plot==
In [[New York City]], a man with a camera follows a woman from an elevator through a corridor to another elevator, where all the people appear to be gray. He gets off on a floor before the woman and runs down the stairs. Lights flicker and the elevator cable snaps. As the man reaches the basement, the cab crashes and its door spills open to reveal the woman's wrist, covered with blood. The man begins to snap photos. Later, in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[FBI]] [[Assistant Director]] [[Alvin Kersh]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]) assigns [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]), along with Agent Peyton Ritter from New York, to the case. Scully's partner [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) looks at the material on Scully's desk and points out that the case looks like an [[X-file]]—and that Kersh is obviously splitting them up.

Scully and Ritter soon discover that their prime suspect, Alfred Fellig, who has worked as a police photographer since 1964, has not aged at all in any of his official photos on his renewal applications. Elsewhere in the city, Fellig watches a criminal kill a youth for his sneakers. When he approaches to take photos of the dying young man, the murderer returns and repeatedly stabs Fellig, but he pulls the knife out of his back and walks away. Scully and Ritter learn of the crime and of the fact that Fellig's prints are on the knife. Ritter demands to know how Fellig always seems to be around when people die, but Scully realizes that the man is in pain and asks whether he was wounded in the attack which Fellig says he merely observed. When she sees the wounds on his back she sends him to the hospital, much to Ritter's chagrin. Ritter reminds Scully that they are trying to charge Fellig with murder, not let him go.

Ritter leaves Scully staking out Fellig's apartment, but Scully is unnerved when she sees Fellig shooting photos of her out his window and bangs on his door, demanding to know how he took photos at a crime scene before the police even knew the crime had been committed. He invites her to take a ride with him so he can show her. After driving, he sees a [[prostitute]] who appears to be gray to him. Fellig tells Scully that the woman will be dead very soon. A [[pimp]] approaches the woman and begins to harass her. Scully leaps out of the car with her gun, announcing that she is an FBI agent and handcuffing the pimp, but when the prostitute tries to flee, she is hit by a truck and killed.

Scully goes to warn Fellig that he is about to be charged for murder, and accuses him of profiting from people's deaths. In his darkroom, Fellig shows Scully a photo of a dead woman with an odd fuzzy shape around her head, which the photographer claims is [[Death (personification)|Death]]. When asked why he bothers to try to photograph Death, Fellig says that it is so he can look Death in the face and finally die. He claims to be 149 years old, and says he cannot kill himself. Scully points out that most people would like to live forever, but Fellig says that he has experienced everything, and that even love does not last forever. Suddenly, he notices that Scully is gray, and says, "Count your blessings." When she asks about the science of his immortality, he says he was meant to die of [[yellow fever]], but he refused to look Death in the face, so instead Death took the kind nurse who had taken care of him.  Fellig takes a photo just as Ritter enters and shoots. The bullet passes right through the camera and through Fellig into Scully, who collapses. While Ritter rushes to call an ambulance, Fellig asks Scully whether she saw Death and begs her to close her eyes. He covers her hand with his own. The color returns to Scully's hand as Fellig's turns gray. Looking up, he dies.

At the hospital, Mulder watches through a window as Ritter apologizes to Scully, then tells Ritter that he's a lucky man (because Scully survived). Going inside the room, Mulder reports to Scully that Fellig died of a single gunshot wound, while the doctors are amazed at her own rapid recovery.&lt;ref name="plot"/&gt;

==Production==

===Writing===

[[File:Vince Gilligan 2010.jpg|"Tithonus" was written by Vince Gilligan.|175px|thumb|right]]

An ''X-Files'' story about immortality had been discussed by the writers for a number of years, but they always struggled with making the concept "scary". Frank Spotnitz, the show's executive producer, claimed that the breakthrough came when they began contemplating the idea of an immortal photographer trying to catch [[Death (personification)|Death]] so that he could die.&lt;ref name="m118"/&gt; [[Vince Gilligan]] was assigned to outline and write "Tithonus", and he took inspiration from three distinct aspects of history and myth. The first of these was the story of Arthur "[[Weegee]]" Fellig, a famous photographer, whose name served as the inspiration for Alfred Fellig. The second was the New York [[Yellow fever]] epidemic in the 19th century. The third and most fantastical inspiration was the Greek myth of [[Tithonus]] (to which this episode's title alludes), who was the son of [[Cephalus]] and the lover of [[Eos]], Goddess of the Dawn. Eos later kidnapped him to be her lover and asked Zeus to make him immortal. Eos, however, forgot to ask for eternal youth to go with eternal life, resulting in Tithonus living forever but degenerating into a husk of a man.&lt;ref name="m117"&gt;Meisler, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was not the first ''X-Files'' episode to reference to immortality. The [[The X-Files (season 3)|season three]] episode "[[Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose]]" featured Scully being told by the titular character that she would not die.&lt;ref name=immortal/&gt; This episode was the inception of a lesser-known story arc that was originally supposed to reveal that Scully was immortal.&lt;ref name=immortal&gt;{{cite web|last=Daniel|first=Josh|title=The Immortal Agent Scully |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2002/01/the_immortal_agent_scully.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=31 January 2002 |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-plot, popular with fans on the internet, was verified by Spotnitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Scully Immortal? |url=http://biglight.com/blog/is-scully-immortal/ |first=Frank |last=Spotnitz |authorlink=Frank Spotnitz |date=31 August 2009 |publisher=Big Light Productions |accessdate=10 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421031124/http://biglight.com/blog/is-scully-immortal/ |archivedate=21 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Spotnitz later admitted that this sub-plot was bookended by "Tithonus", a solution that Spotnitz later called "very satisfying".&lt;ref name="m118"&gt;Meisler, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming and effects===
While the first five seasons of the series were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, production of the show's sixth season was based in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]], Rabwin, Paul and [[Kim Manners|Manners, Kim]] |year=2000 |title=The Truth About Season Six |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vitaris|first=Paula|title=X-Files: A Mixed Bag of Episodes and a Feature Film Pave the Way for Season Six|journal=Cinefantastique|date=October 1998|volume=30|issue=7/8|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the scenes for "Tithonus" were shot on the sound stage of ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] program whose sets were just across from the Fox studios.&lt;ref name="m119"&gt;Meisler, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Fellig's cameras were borrowed from the [[University of California]]'s Museum of Photography, and many of the photographs were used courtesy of the Los Angeles-based [[advertising agency|advertising]] and [[licensing agency|licensing]] agency [[Branded Entertainment Network|Corbis]]. The production staff of ''The X-Files'' was tasked with not only creating the photographs that Fellig takes, but also with ensuring that each looked as if it belonged to a discrete time period. Tom Day, the episodes property master, researched "popular government [[font|typefaces]] and printing technologies" to make the pictures as historically accurate as possible.&lt;ref name="m118"/&gt;

The episode featured several special effects. The stab wounds that were on Fellig's back were constructed in "precisely graduated sizes" to show Fellig's healing powers.&lt;ref name="m119"/&gt; The faux-wounds were then applied to Lewis' back by make-up department head Cheri Montesanto-Mecalf. Reportedly the effect that caused the most headaches was turning select figures in photos black-and-white. Visual effects producer Bill Millar noted that the process, was "very similar to [[Film colorization|the one used to wreck all those old movies by colorizing them]]. In fact, it's basically the same, only in reverse".&lt;ref name="m119"/&gt; The "painstaking" process involved outlining what needed to be de-colorized.&lt;ref name="m119"/&gt; A computer program then completed the job. Millar had previously used the technique on the NBC series ''[[Nightmare Cafe]]'' in 1992 as well as the 1998 movie ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]''.&lt;ref name="m119"/&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:Alfred Lord Tennyson 1869.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Alfred Fellig has thematically been compared to the Tithonus in [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s [[dramatic monologue]] [[Tithonus (poem)|of the same name]].]]
Besides a direct reference to the titular mythological character, Matthew VanWinkle, in the chapter "Tennyson's 'Tithonus' and the Exhaustion of Survival in ''The X-Files''", of the book ''The X-Files and Literature: Unweaving the Story, Unraveling the Lie to Find the Truth'', argues that the episode bears a striking resemblance to [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s [[dramatic monologue]] "[[Tithonus (poem)|Tithonus]]". In the poem, one line reads "Alas! For this gray shadow, once a man."&lt;ref name=winkle1&gt;VanWinkle, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=winkle2&gt;VanWinkle, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; VanWinkle argues that in ''The X-Files'' episode, this line is paralleled by Alfred Fellig's tendency to see those about to die in a monochromatic vision.&lt;ref name=winkle2/&gt; Furthermore, both the poem and the episode stress that death is not appealing because it is simply "a means to an end".&lt;ref name=winkle3/&gt; Rather, it is to be sought because it "is the event that most fully unites us with other humans."&lt;ref name=winkle3&gt;VanWinkle, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

VanWinkle compared and contrasted Fellig with Eugene Victor Tooms, from the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first season]] episodes "[[Squeeze (The X-Files)|Squeeze]]" and "[[Tooms]]", and John Barnett, from the first season entry "[[Young at Heart (The X-Files)|Young at Heart]]".&lt;ref name=winkle4&gt;VanWinkle, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; While all three are similar in that they have obtained, to a varying degree, elements of immortality, Tooms is different from Fellig because he is a "monstrous predator", and Barnett is unlike Fellig because he is a mere [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]].&lt;ref name=winkle4/&gt;&lt;ref name=winkle5&gt;VanWinkle, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; Fellig, however, is the only character, out of the three, to possess true immortality. Furthermore, he is separated from Tooms and Barnett due to his distinct hatred for his ability; he did not want to be immortal; rather, it was forced upon him. VanWinkle also notes that Fellig is, furthermore, different from Tennyson's Tithonus because the latter actively sought immortality, due to the flaw of [[hubris]] or extreme pride, in order to become more like a god.&lt;ref name=winkle5/&gt;&lt;ref name=winkle6&gt;VanWinkle, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode, VanWinkle draws parallels between Scully and Tithonus' lover [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]]. In the end, both will "continue [their] ending and invariable office"—in the former's case, investigating crimes, and in the latter's case, raising the dawn.&lt;ref&gt;VanWinkle, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; The themes of immortality and escaping death were later revisited in the [[The X-Files (season 8)|eight season]] episode "[[The Gift (The X-Files)|The Gift]]". In the episode, Agent [[John Doggett]], played by [[Robert Patrick]], is looking for clues following Mulder's abduction. Without Scully, he travels to Pennsylvania and seeks out a [[soul eater (folklore)|soul eater]]: a being that can consume another person's injuries. In the end, Doggett is fatally shot, and the soul eater, wishing to die, consumes Doggett's death. VanWinkle argues that this episode serves as a direct parallel to "Tithonus", although it switches the perspective significantly.&lt;ref&gt;VanWinkle, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast and reception==
"Tithonus" first aired in the [[United States]] on January 24, 1999.&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=The X-Files: The Complete Sixth Season |titlelink=The X-Files (season 6) |origyear=1998–1999 |others=[[Kim Manners]], et al |type=booklet |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Corporation|Fox]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 9.2, with a 13 share, meaning that roughly 9.2 percent of all television-equipped households, and 13 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode.&lt;ref name="ratings"/&gt; It was viewed by 15.90 million viewers.&lt;ref name="ratings"&gt;Meisler, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; The episode aired in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] on [[Sky1]] on May 9, 1999 and received 0.79 million viewers, making it the third most watched episode that week.&lt;ref name="barb2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10/? |title=BARB's multichannel top 10 programmes |publisher=barb.co.uk |accessdate=1 January 2012}} Note: Information is in the section titled "w/e May 3–9, 1999", listed under Sky 1&lt;/ref&gt; Fox promoted the episode with the tagline "When death looks you in the face... you're dead. Tonight, Scully gets a good hard look."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite sign |title= Tithonus |year=1999 |type=Promotional Flyer |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |location=[[Los Angeles, California]]|url=http://i550.photobucket.com/albums/ii421/maurisap/xfiles%20forum/97deathlooksyouinface.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was met with largely positive reviews. Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote positively of the episode and awarded it an "A" grade.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; He noted the entries' similarities with "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", noting that both deal with men "who [know] too much about death for [their] own good".&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; He also praised the characterization of Scully and Fellig; he noted that the former is "no-nonsense" and optimistic, whereas the latter is a "creepy man" who is jealous of those who are capable of dying. Handlen concluded that the episode "doesn’t play out like a classic monster episode, it feels like one".&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite web|last=Handlen|first=Zack|title='Tithonus'/'Borrowed Time' {{!}} X-Files/Millennium {{!}} TV Club {{!}} TV|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/tithonusborrowed-time,83320/|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=[[The Onion]]|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Kessenich, in his book ''Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files'' wrote positively of the episode, comparing it favorably to "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose". He wrote, "If imitation is the highest form of flattery, what is a fascinating offshoot of a previous incarnation? I'd say it looks a lot like the latest entry into Season 6 of ''The X-Files''. The engaging 'Tithonus'."&lt;ref name="mess"&gt;Kessenich, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen'', rated the episode five stars out of five, drawing comparisons to "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", but noting that the former has "a flavour all of its own". Shearman and Pearson praised Geoffrey Lewis' portrayal of Fellig, and described "Tithonus" as "bizarre, chilling, and yet strangely life-affirming".&lt;ref&gt;Shearman and Pearson, pp. 176–177&lt;/ref&gt; Paula Vitaris from ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' gave the episode a mixed-to-positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four.&lt;ref name=cinepaula&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vitaris|first=Paula|title=Sixth Season Episode Guide|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=October 1999|volume=31|issue=8|pages=26–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitaris wrote that the episode had a "terrific 'feel'". In addition, Vitaris, despite slightly criticizing Gillian Anderson's "tired" performance through most of the episode, called Anderson's acting in the scene wherein Scully is shot "excellent", citing her "amazement and near-paralysis" as reasons why the scene was a success.&lt;ref name=cinepaula/&gt; The character of Alfred Fellig has also attracted positive critical acclaim. [[UGO Networks]] listed him amongst the greatest monster-of-the-week characters in ''The X-Files''.&lt;ref name="UGO"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/movies/top-xfiles-monsters-alfred-fellig |title=Alfred Fellig – Top X-Files Monsters |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=2 March 2012 |work=[[UGO Networks]] |publisher=[[IGN Entertainment]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830092159/http://www.ugo.com/movies/top-xfiles-monsters-alfred-fellig |archivedate=30 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uli figures''' are wooden statues from [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. Like their neighbors to the north and south, the artistic traditions of the peoples of central New Ireland formerly focused largely around [[burial rites|mortuary rites]]. In contrast to the intricate ''[[malagan]]'' carvings of the north, artists in central New Ireland produced less ornate but more permanent figures known as ''uli'', which were kept and reused many times. No longer made today, uli were displayed as part of lengthy [[fertility rites]] involving the exhumation and reburial of human skulls, which accompanied the planting of [[Sacred herbs|sacred plants]]. 

When a newly carved uli was brought out, a [[shaman]] assisted in inducing the spirit of the deceased chief to enter the carving, and after the ceremony, the work was kept in the "men's house" where it would continue to aid the successor and his people.

Uli figures appear [[hermaphroditic]], having both a phallus and prominent breasts. This blending of male and female features possibly symbolized the fertile and nourishing powers of clan leaders, who were expected to provide for the other members of the clan. The Uli figures probably symbolized the connection between paternal and maternal life energy in initiation ceremonies.

The '''''Zweites Buch''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈtsvaɪ̯təs buːχ|pron}}, "Second Book"), unofficially published in English as '''''Hitler's Secret Book''''' and then officially '''''Hitler's Second Book''''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-929631-16-2 Publishers Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt; is an unedited transcript of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s thoughts on [[foreign policy]] written in 1928; it was written after ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and was not published in his lifetime. The ''Zweites Buch'' was not published in 1928 because ''Mein Kampf'' did not sell well at that time and Hitler's publisher, [[Franz-Eher-Verlag]], told Hitler that a second book would hinder sales even more.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

==''Zweites Buch'' and ''Mein Kampf''==
{{Further|Nazi Foreign Policy (debate)}}

There are a number of similarities and differences between ''Zweites Buch'' and ''Mein Kampf''. As in ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler declared that the [[Jews]] were his eternal and most dangerous opponents. As in ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler outlined what the German historian [[Andreas Hillgruber]] has called his ''Stufenplan'' ("stage-by-stage plan"). Hitler himself never used the term ''Stufenplan'', which was coined by Hillgruber in his 1965 book ''Hitlers Strategie''. Briefly, the ''Stufenplan'' called for three stages. In the first stage, there would be a massive military build-up, the overthrow of the shackles of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and the forming of alliances with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] and the [[British Empire]]. The second stage would be a series of fast, "[[blitzkrieg|lightning wars]]" in conjunction with Italy and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] against France and whichever of her allies in Eastern Europe—such as [[Czechoslovakia]], Poland, [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]]—chose to stand by her. The third stage would be a war to obliterate what Hitler considered to be the "[[Judeo-Bolshevik]]" regime in the [[Soviet Union]].

In contrast to ''Mein Kampf'', in ''Zweites Buch'' Hitler added a fourth stage to the ''Stufenplan''. He insinuated that in the far future a struggle for [[Hegemony|world domination]] might take place between the [[United States]] and a European alliance comprising a new association of nations, consisting of individual states with high national value.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler, Adolf; Weinberg, Gerhard L. (editor) (2003). ''Hitler's second book: the unpublished sequel to Mein Kampf'', p. 227. Enigma.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zweites Buch'' also offers a different perspective on the U.S. than that outlined in ''Mein Kampf''. In the latter, Hitler declared that Germany's most dangerous opponent on the international scene was the [[Soviet Union]]; in ''Zweites Buch'', Hitler declared that for immediate purposes, the [[Soviet Union]] was still the most dangerous opponent, but that in the long-term, the most dangerous potential opponent was the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hillgruber, Andreas ''Germany and the Two World Wars'', Harvard University Press: Cambridge, 1981 pages 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lebensraum ==

In the first two chapters Hitler proclaims the balance between population and natural resources to be the main focus of any nation, and he gives it a far-reaching and detailed analysis.

The starting point of his analysis is the "struggle for daily bread" (food production) as the basis of human society. From this need for self-preservation, he develops his central idea of the relationship between the population and the size of the habitat of a people. If the habitat cannot provide sufficient resources for survival, degeneration and a decline of the nation results. Hitler raises the struggle for adequate habitat to a central principle of human history. Hitler points out that this battle is often enforced militarily, as history has adequately demonstrated.

As solutions to the struggle for living space, Hitler considers birth control, emigration of the population, increased food production, and increased exports to buy additional food. All of these alternatives he finds problematic. Birth control and emigration he believes leads to a weakening of the nation, as people are the true life-blood of the nation. The increase of food production he declares to be fundamentally limited by a finite amount of productive land. Greater exports he discards because it leads to increased market competition with other nations, making Germany dependent on outside nations and therefore leading to the situation Germany faced with the start of World War I in 1914. Hitler revisits these arguments several times in subsequent chapters.

== Foreign policy ==
In the other chapters Hitler developed his thoughts on the future National Socialist foreign policy that serves the struggle for living space. As in ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler explains that the Jews are the eternal and most dangerous opponents of the German people; he also outlines and elaborates on his future political plans.

In ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler mentioned the United States only occasionally and even with contempt. They were, to him, a "racially degenerate" society that will continue to see its demise. In his second book, however, Hitler describes the United States as a dynamic and "racially successful" society that has eugenics, racial segregation practices, and an exemplary immigration policy at the expense of "inferior" immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. Why this change occurred in Hitler's attitude between 1924 and 1928 is unknown. Historians have noted that Hitler was notoriously poorly informed about the world outside Germany and, at the time of the writing of ''Mein Kampf'', he probably knew little about the United States.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Hitler's knowledge of the U.S. came especially from the Western novels of [[Karl May]] he read.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} This seems to have changed by 1928; Hitler would have heard of the prosperity and industrialization in the United States, as well as the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], and the forced sterilization concept for supposedly mentally retarded people in several states. Hitler stated his admiration for such measures, as well as his wish that Germany should adopt similar policies on a larger scale.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Hitler stated that National Socialist foreign policy was to be based on Lebensraum for the German people:
{{quote|The National Socialist Movement, on the contrary, will always let its foreign policy be determined by the necessity to secure the space necessary to the life of our Folk. It knows no Germanising or Teutonising, as in the case of the national bourgeoisie, but only the spread of its own Folk. It will never see in the subjugated, so called Germanised, Czechs or Poles a national, let alone Folkish, strengthening, but only the racial weakening of our Folk.&lt;ref&gt;Zweites Buch, p.143&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Ideas on international relations==
Of all of Germany's potential enemies comprising the [[Allies of World War II]], Hitler ranked the U.S. as the most dangerous. By contrast, Hitler saw the United Kingdom as a fellow "[[Aryan race|Aryan]]" power that in exchange for Germany's renunciation of naval and colonial ambitions would ally itself with Germany. France, in Hitler's opinion, was rapidly "[[Negro]]izing" itself. In regard to the Soviet Union, Hitler dismissed the Russian people as being [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] ''[[Untermenschen]]'' ("sub-humans") incapable of intelligent thought. Hitler consequently believed that the Russian people were ruled by what he regarded as a gang of bloodthirsty but inept Jewish revolutionaries.

===United Kingdom===
In ''Zweites Buch'', Hitler called for an Anglo-German alliance based on political expediency as well as the notion that the two Germanic powers were natural allies. In ''Zweites Buch'', Hitler argued that the alleged British striving for a balance of power leading to an Anglo-German alliance would not conflict with his goal of Germany being the dominant continental power because it was wrong to believe that "England fought every [[hegemony|hegemonic]] power immediately", but rather was prepared to accept dominant states whose aims were "obviously and purely continental in nature".&lt;ref&gt;Jäckel, Eberhard ''Hitler's World View'' page 41&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler went on to write that "Of course no one in Britain will conclude an alliance for the good of Germany, but only in the furtherance of British interests."&lt;ref&gt;Strobl, Gerwin ''The Germanic Isle'' page 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, because Hitler believed that there was an ongoing struggle between the "Jewish invasion" and the "old British tradition" for the control of the United Kingdom, Hitler believed the chances for Anglo-German alliance to be good provided the "Jewish invasion" was resisted successfully.&lt;ref name="Leitz, Christian page 35"&gt;Leitz, Christian ''Nazi Foreign Policy'' page 35&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler hedged somewhat, however, by claiming that

{{quote|The instincts of Anglo-Saxondom are still so sharp and alive that one cannot speak of a complete victory of Jewry, but rather, in part the latter is still forced to adjust its interests to those of the English. If the Jew were to triumph in England, English interests would recede into the background.... [But] if the Briton triumphs then a shift of England's attitude ''vis-à-vis'' Germany can still take place."&lt;ref name="Leitz, Christian page 35" /&gt;}}

==English publication history==
The book was said to be "pirated", poorly translated in English, and then unofficially published as ''Hitler's Secret Book'' in 1962. More than forty years later, it was re-released "officially" in 2003 as ''Hitler's Second Book'' with newer translation by [[Gerhard Weinberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://endeavors.unc.edu/spr2005/weinberg.php Endeavors.unc.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;
