An '''art dealer''' is a person or company that buys and sells [[works of art]]. Art dealers' professional associations serve to set high standards for accreditation or membership and to support art exhibitions and shows.&lt;ref name="ADAA"&gt;[http://www.artdealers.org/dnloads/adaa_guide.pdf Collector's Guide to Working with Art Dealers, 45th Anniversary Edition, The Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA), New York] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008045449/http://www.artdealers.org/dnloads/adaa_guide.pdf |date=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
An art dealer typically seeks out various [[artist]]s to represent, and builds relationships with [[art collector|collectors]] and [[museum]]s whose interests are likely to match the work of the represented artists. Some dealers are able to anticipate [[market trends]], while some prominent dealers may be able to influence the taste of the market. Many dealers specialize in a particular style, period, or region. They often travel internationally, frequenting [[Art exhibition|exhibitions]], [[auctions]], and artists' [[studio]]s looking for good buys, little-known treasures, and exciting new works. When dealers buy works of art, they resell them either in their galleries or directly to collectors. Those who deal in [[contemporary art]] usually exhibit artists' works in their galleries, and take a percentage of the price the works sell for.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7u8s0SN7KcC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=art+dealer%27s+percentage+of+the+artwork+price&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AAbXUoOSH-iy0QXf44DQDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=art%20dealer's%20percentage%20of%20the%20artwork%20price&amp;f=false Alan D. Bryce, ''Art Smart: The Intelligent Guide to Investing in the Canadian Art Market''], Dundurn, 2007. {{ISBN|1550026763}}, 9781550026764&lt;/ref&gt;

==Job requirements==
[[File:Gillis van Tilborgh - A Picture Gallery.jpg|thumb|300px|''A Picture Gallery'' by [[Gillis van Tilborch]], 1660s]]
Art dealers often study the [[history of art]] before entering on their careers. Related careers that often cross-over include [[curator]]s of museums and [[art auction]] firms are industry-related careers.&lt;ref name="ADAA" /&gt; Gallery owners who do not succeed may seek to work for more successful galleries. Others pursue careers as [[art critic]]s, academics, curators of museums or auction houses, or practicing artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonreview.com/careers.aspx?cid=12 Career: Art Dealer, The Princeton Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dealers have to understand the business side of the art world. They keep up with trends in the market and are knowledgeable about the style of art people want to buy. They figure out how much they should pay for a piece and then estimate the resale price. They are also often passionate and knowledgeable about art. Those who deal with contemporary art promote new artists, creating a market for the artists' works and securing financial success for themselves.  The art world is subject to economic booms and bust just like any other market. Art dealers must be economically conscious in order to maintain their livelihoods. The mark ups of art work must be carefully monitored. If prices and profits are too large, then investments may be devalued should an overstock or economic downturn occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/04/15/smbusiness/singing_in_rain_art.fsb/index.htm?section=magazines_fsb | author=Cowley, Stacy | title=Amid art boom, dealers brace for a bust | publisher=Fortune Small Business | date=2008-04-16 | accessdate=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine an artwork's value, dealers inspect the objects or paintings closely, and compare the fine details with similar pieces. Some dealers with many years of experience learn to identify unsigned works by examining stylistic features such as brush strokes, color, form. They recognize the styles of different periods and individual artists. Often art dealers are able to distinguish authentic works from [[forgeries]] (although even dealers are sometimes fooled).&lt;ref name="ADAA" /&gt;

==Notable art dealers==
[[File:Frans Francken the Younger - A visit to the Art Dealer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|''A visit to the Art Dealer'' by [[Frans Francken the Younger]], early 1600s]]
* [[Guillam Forchondt|Guillam Forchondt the Elder]] (1608–1678)

A 17th century Flemish Baroque painter and art dealer based in Antwerp.  He established an important art dealing business with international connections in Europe maintained by his extended family. He originally trained as a painter and cabinet maker but built a reputation through his international art business.  His children became art dealers who settled in various cities in Europe such as Venice, Paris, Vienna, Prague, Linz, [[Passau]] and [[Cadiz]] where they supplied an elite clientele with a variety of art objects.  When in the 1670s Flanders suffered a severe economic downturn due mostly to an invasion by the French, Guillam Forchondt and his brother Melchior the Younger became art entrepreneurs by hiring lesser painters to create group projects such as large commissioned copies of famous works or large decorative objects. At one point, the ''Brothers Forchondt'' had 60 painters in service for export to France, Austria, Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/28613 Guilliam Forchondt] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Matthijs Musson]] ([[Antwerp]], 1598–3 November 1678)

A painter and art dealer based in Antwerp, who helped popularize artists of the 17th century [[Antwerp school]] by marketing them throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="maere"&gt;J. de Maere, Jennifer A. Martin, and Marie Wabbes. ''Illustrated Dictionary of 17th Century Flemish Painters''. Brussels: Renaissance du livre, 1994; p. 294. {{ISBN|2-8041-1858-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his correspondences have been published and studies of his business relationships with other dealers across Europe have established ideas about the art trade and its economics.&lt;ref name="maere" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil De Marchi, [[Hans J. Van Miegroet]] and Matthew E. Raiff, "Dealer-Dealer Pricing in the Mid Seventeenth-Century Antwerp to Paris Art Trade," in Michael North and David Ormrod, ''Art Markets in Europe, 1400-1800'', Aldershot: Ashgate, 1998; pp. 113–130. {{ISBN|1-84014-630-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halpert was born in 1900 in [[Odessa]], arrived in the U.S. as a penniless Russian [[Jewish]] immigrant and grew to become a pioneering New York City art dealer, transforming the landscape of [[Modern art]]. Over her forty-year career from 1926 through the 1960s, Halpert brought recognition and market success to many [[avant-garde]] American artists. Her establishment The Downtown Gallery, one of the first in Greenwich Village, introduced and showcased many modern art luminaries. Halpert died at age 70 a multimillionaire, with [[Sotheby's]] crediting her with having put modernist painting auctions on the map. Its posthumous sale of her collection went for million in 1973.

* [[Klaus Perls]]
Perls (1912–2008) was born and raised in Berlin. He studied art history in Munich, but was forced to finish his education in Basel, Switzerland, as the Nazis were no longer allowing degrees for Jews. He ran Perls Galleries for over 60 years. His gallery dealt with contemporary American artists, modern works from the School of [[Paris]] and Mexican and South American art. Perls also developed an interest in art from Benin and built a sizable collection. He was not only an art dealer, but also a donor as he contributed many significant works of art to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. He died June 2, 2008 in [[Mount Kisco, New York|Mount Kisco, N.Y.]] at age 96.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/05/arts/design/05perls.html?ref=design | author=Grimes, William | title=Klaus Perls, Art Dealer Who Gave Picassos to the Met, Dies at 96 | publisher=New York Times | date=2008-06-05 | accessdate=2008-06-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080612003117/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/05/arts/design/05perls.html?ref=design| archivedate= 12 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the director of several galleries throughout his career and helped organize shows that featured big names such as [[Robert Indiana]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] and [[Andy Warhol]]. Weber died May 23, 2008 in [[Hudson, New York|Hudson, N.Y.]] at age 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/arts/design/01weber.html?ref=design | author=Smith, Roberta | title=John Weber, 75, Contemporary-Art Dealer, Is Dead | publisher=New York Times | date=2008-06-01 | accessdate=2008-06-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080612003444/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/arts/design/01weber.html?ref=design| archivedate= 12 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4983">The [[Arts Council]] of [[Pakistan]] [[Karachi]] is arguably the largest council made for the purpose of promoting [[art]]s and [[culture]] in Pakistan, and perhaps the busiest in terms of organizing events on a yearly basis. Given the kind of [[sociopolitical]] turn that the country has taken with reference to [[religious extremism]], it makes the council all the more significant an institution to uphold and foster the traditions of the arts that aim to give society a balanced approach to life. It is the country's oldest and most famous NGO (non-government organization) that deals in promotion and development of arts and crafts in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;[https://tribune.com.pk/story/1250759/glue-holds-despite-borders-urdu-literature-connects-india-pakistan/ The glue that holds: 'Despite borders, Urdu literature connects India, Pakistan'] The Express Tribune newspaper, Published 1 December 2016, Retrieved 17 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=karachievents&gt;[http://www.karachievents.com/arts-council-pakistan/ Profile of The Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi], Retrieved 17 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawn1&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/378131/karachi-arts-council-auditorium Grants from the government for Arts Council of Pakistan], Dawn newspaper, Published 25 December 2004, Retrieved 17 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==

In 1948, a group of art enthusiasts gathered and formed themselves into a society under the name of ''Karachi [[Fine Arts]] Society''. It was first of its kind to promote and encourage arts and culture in Pakistan. It held exhibitions and promoted activities relating to [[theatre]].

The funds of the society were contributed personally by the members themselves. They had no permanent building of their own. Their meetings were therefore held at the residences of the office bearers. Art exhibitions were held in rented space in private houses. Six years later in 1954, the ''Karachi Fine Arts Society'' was reorganized into a body called the ''Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi''. This organization was registered with the registrar of societies, Karachi, under Act XX1 of 1860. (The Registration Certificate was issued on 10 May 1955). After its formation, the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi stepped up activities in the field of arts and culture. It also has sponsored production of plays and musical programs - for example, it recently held a ''Musical Tribute Event'' in 2017 in honor of the late [[Bade Fateh Ali Khan]] (Pakistan's famous classical music singer) in its auditorium.&lt;ref name=ArtsCouncil&gt;[http://artscouncil.org.pk/acp/index.php/2017/03/02/tribute-to-music-icon-ustad-fateh-ali-khan/ Tribute to Music icon Ustad Fateh Ali Khan], Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi website, Published 2 March 2017, Retrieved 17 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Battle of Yesil Kol Nor''''' is an 18th-century war painting created by Chinese court painters and European Jesuit monks. It was commissioned by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the Chinese [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] as part of an order of 16 large battle paintings (8 metres wide by 4 metres tall) to commemorate battles that took place in [[Qurman]], [[Xinjiang]] province in February 1759. The battles resulted in the Qing Empire successfully regaining control of Xinjiang from Turks who had occupied the province following the ousting of the [[Dzungar people]] from the region by Qing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Background of the Battle of Qurman Painting from 1760, Qing Court Painting |url=http://www.battle-of-qurman.com.cn/e/hist.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Berikaoba''' ({{lang-ka|ბერიკაობა}}) is an improvised [[masquerade ceremony|masqueraded]] folk theatre in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], stemming from the [[paganism|pagan]] festivity of fertility and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Burney, Charles Allen &amp; [[David Marshall Lang|Lang, David Marshall]] (1972), ''The Peoples of the Hills: Ancient Ararat and Caucasus'', p. 224. Praeger&lt;/ref&gt; The name is derived from a [[Common Kartvelian]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''ber'' (ბერ), meaning "a child". The scenes of Berikaoba range from those of explicitly [[eroticism|erotic]] nature to [[political satire]] and social protest.&lt;ref name="Georgia Today"&gt;Strelkova, Ruso. "Georgia’s pagan carnivals cherish fertility". ''Georgia Today''. April 4, 2008. Retrieved on March 25, 2011 from [http://georgiandaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=774&amp;Itemid=134 ''Georgian Daily''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318072518/http://georgiandaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=774&amp;Itemid=134 |date=March 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Timothy; Porter, James &amp; Goertzen, Chris (2000), ''The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: Europe'', vol. 8, p. 834. Garland Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8240-6034-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Berikaoba typically involves several men, the berika, who are mostly disguised as animals. The costumes and masks for the [[mystery play|mystery]] are made of animal hide. Animal skulls, tails, feathers, horns, [[pumpkin]]s, ribbons and bells are used to add colorfulness to the scene. The festivity begins with a gathering of villagers who chose actors for the mystery. The procession of berikas – accompanied by sounds of [[bagpipes]] ([[gudastviri|stviri]]) – move door-to-door to pick wine, honey, floor, meat and other victuals served by hosts. The main characters in the procession are a "bride" called Kekela (კეკელა) and a groom who, after a series of attempts, persuades Kekela to marry her. The wedding is then disrupted by an appearance of a "[[Tatars|Tatar]]", a reference to the centuries of invasions from neighboring [[Muslim]] powers. The groom is killed and the people console Kekela, promising her a better husband. As berikas try to resuscitate the groom with help of healing water, herbs and minerals, the news spreads about the abduction of Kekela. This brings the groom back to life. He chases the kidnappers and relieves her bride. The performance finishes with a lengthy feast, ''[[Supra (feast)|supra]]''.&lt;ref name="Georgia Today"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abakelia, Nino (2008), [http://www.folklore.ee/Folklore/vol40/abakelia.pdf "The Spaciotemporal Patterns of Georgian Winter Solstice Festivals"]. ''Folklore'' 40: 101-116&lt;/ref&gt; 

The similar tradition, ''keenoba'' (ყეენობა, from "the [[Khan (title)|Khan]]"), satirizing the foreign invaders of Georgia and later the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] officialdom, enjoyed particular popularity in the 19th-century [[Tbilisi]] and its environs.&lt;ref name="Suny"&gt;[[Ronald Grigor Suny|Suny, Ronald Grigor]] (1994), ''The Making of the Georgian Nation'', p. 90.

Ink, tempera, and gold leaf on vellum 1' 1½" × 8¼".  [[Osterreichische Nationalbibliothek]], Vienna 2554. God shapes the universe with the aid of a compass.

The '''''Bible moralisée'''''&lt;ref&gt;Also known as the "Bible Historiée", the "Bible Allégorisée" and sometimes "Emblémes Bibliques".&lt;/ref&gt; is a later name for the most important example of the medieval picture bibles, called in general "[[biblia pauperum]]", to have survived.  They are heavily illustrated, and extremely expensive, [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the thirteenth century, and from the copies that still survive it is clear that they existed in at least two versions with different contents. They were similar in the choice and order of the Biblical texts selected, but differed in the allegorical and moral deductions drawn from these passages.

Though large, the manuscripts only contained selections of the text of the Bible, along with commentary and illustrations. Each page pairs Old and New Testament episodes with illustrations explaining their moral significance in terms of [[typology (theology)|typology]].

There are seven surviving fully illustrated manuscripts of the Bible moralisée group;&lt;ref&gt;Lowden, 11,&lt;/ref&gt; all date from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries and were designed for the personal use of the French royal family.&lt;ref&gt;Greenspoon, 607&lt;/ref&gt;  Four were created in the early thirteenth century,&lt;ref name="Tachau, 7"&gt;Tachau, 7&lt;/ref&gt; when church art dominated the decorative arts. As common in [[stained glass]] and other [[Gothic art]] of the time, the illustrations are framed within medallions.&lt;ref&gt;“Gothic Art and Architecture”&lt;/ref&gt;   The text explained the theological and moral meanings of the text.&lt;ref name="Tachau, 7"/&gt;  Many artists were involved in the creation of each of the ''Bibles moralisées'', and their identities and shares of the work remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Lowden, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the [[European Middle Ages]] the Catholic church made use of pictures as a means of instruction, to supplement the knowledge acquired by reading or oral teaching. Books only existed in manuscript form and, being extremely costly, were beyond the means of most people. Hardly anyone could read, outside the ranks of the clergy and the monks. So [[fresco]]es of scenes from the Old and New Testaments, [[stained-glass windows]], and the like were set up in the churches, because, as the [[Synod of Arras]] (1025) said, "The illiterate contemplated in the lineaments of painting what they, having never learnt to read, could not discern in writing".

Pictures spread abroad a knowledge of the events recorded in the Bible and of the mutual connection between the leading facts of the Old and New Testaments, whether as type and [[antitype]], or as prophecy and fulfillment. For this purpose the picture Bibles of the Middle Ages were copied and put in circulation. Parts of these go back to the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

The ''Bibles moralisées'' were created to interpret and explain scripture.  A broad didactic movement in the first half of the thirteenth century was one that placed an importance on pictures teaching morality. The ''Bible moralisées'' was part of this movement and attempted to do just that.&lt;ref&gt;Cothren, 329-330&lt;/ref&gt; Both the depiction and text must be read because the images hold an interpretation of the world or moment in history, and details within the images hold symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Tachau, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscripts were for private use,&lt;ref&gt;Cothren, 34&lt;/ref&gt; specifically the ''Bibles moraliées'' were designed to teach the French kings. The second of the bible manuscripts, Vienna 1179, may have been written in Latin for the purpose of teaching [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]].

{{POV section|date=February 2017}}{{citations needed|date=October 2018}}
This Bible, as indeed all the picture Bibles of the Middle Ages, did not contain the full text of the Bible, and contained much original commentary. Short passages only were cited, and these not so as to give any continuous sense or line of thought. But the object of the writer seems to have been chiefly to make the texts cited the basis of moral and allegorical teaching, in the manner so common in those days. In the [[Psalter]] he was content with copying out the first verse of each psalm; whilst when dealing with the [[Gospels]] he did not quote from each evangelist separately, but made use of a kind of confused [[diatessaron]] of all four combined. An attempt was made to establish a connection between the events recorded in the Old Testament and those recorded in the New, even when there does not seem to be any very obvious connection between them. Thus the sleep of [[Adam]], recorded in the beginning of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], is said to prefigure the death of Christ; and [[Abraham]] sending his servant with rich presents to seek a wife for his son is a type of the Eternal Father giving the Gospels to the [[Apostles]] to prepare the union of His Son with the Church.

The entire work contains about 5,000 illustrations. The pictures are arranged in two parallel columns on each page, each column having four medallions with pictures. Parallel to the pictures and alternating with them are two other narrower columns, with four legends each, one legend to each picture; the legends consisting alternatively of Biblical texts and moral or [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|allegorical]] applications; whilst the pictures represent the subjects of the Biblical texts or of the applications of them.  The illustrations are executed with the greatest skill. The painting is said to be one of the best specimens of thirteenth-century work and the MS. was in all probability prepared for someone in the highest rank of life. A specimen of the second edition of the "Bible Moralisée" is to be found in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (MS. Français No. 167). Whilst it is identical with the copy which has just been examined in the selection and order of the Biblical passages, it differs from it in the greater simplicity and brevity of the moral and allegorical teaching based on them. Another important Bible, intended to instruct by means of pictures, was that which has been called the "Bible Historiée toute figurée". It was a work of the end of the thirteenth or the beginning of the fourteenth century. In general outline and plan it resembles the class of Bible which has gone before, but it differs from it in the selection of Bible passages and in the allegorical explanations derived from them. Coming to the life of Christ, the author of the "Bible Historiée toute figurée" dispensed with a written text altogether, and contented himself with writing over the pictures depicting scenes of Christ's life, a brief explanatory legend.

The article “The Iconography of Theophilus Windows in the First Half of the Thirteenth Century” by Cothren compares the ''Bibles moralisées'' with [[Theophilus of Adana|Theophilus]] Windows because both have a didactic idea to use pictures to explain ideas regarding morals as well as to juxtapose scenes from the old and new testament. The difference is that stained glass art and the Theophilus Windows are created for public viewing while the ''Bibles moralisées'' were not.&lt;ref name="test52"&gt;[Cothren, “The Iconography”, 329],&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the Theophilus Windows and the ''Bibles moralisées'' are a part of a didactic movement, wherein pictures are relied upon to teach morality.

==The Four Early ''Bibles moralisées''==
The best known copy of the first version is one of the most sumptuous illustrated manuscripts preserved to us from the Middle Ages. It no longer as a single volume; it has been split up into three separate parts kept in three libraries. The first part, consisting of 224 leaves, is in the [[Bodleian Library]] at Oxford. The second part of 222 leaves is in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris; and the third part, made up of 178 leaves, is kept in the  [[British Library]]. Six leaves of the third part are missing, so that it ought to contain 184 leaves. When complete and bound together, therefore, the whole volume consisted of 630 leaves, written and illustrated on one side only.

The Oxford-Paris-London manuscripts consist of 3 volumes and artists had left evidence in their work of working under time pressure.&lt;ref name="test13"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 154],&lt;/ref&gt;  The Oxford-Paris-London bible was the most accessible through publication for five decades in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="test14"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 139],&lt;/ref&gt;

Vienna 2554 made it to the Imperial Library in Vienna in 1783.&lt;ref name="test7"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 53],&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the most familiar of the bibles. It has a frontispiece that is one of the most reproduced images of the Middle Ages. This manuscript is the most accessible to scholars from all the ''Bibles moralisées'', this is due to an exceptional facsimile that has been published in full colour. This facsimile was published in three thousand copies at its original size in 1973. As well, the facsimile has been republished (first in 1992 and again in 1995) twice at half the size of the original. These publications have allowed the wide exchange of Vienna 2554.&lt;ref name="test8"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 11],&lt;/ref&gt;  The second of the bibles is also in Vienna, its codex is 1179, and it is less accessible than Vienna 2554 through publication.&lt;ref name="test9"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 55],&lt;/ref&gt;  Some evidence shows that Vienna 1179 was a rethought version of what was first created in Vienna 2554; this reverses the usual connection that is made between the two.&lt;ref name="test10"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 56],&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the close relations between France and Spain in the 13th century, there appeared several moralized Bibles in Spain at this time. One complete version, similar to that described above, is the [[St. Louis Bible]]. It was copied and illustrated between 1226 and 1234 in Paris on the orders of [[Blanche of Castile]] for her son [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], who gave it to [[Alfonso X of Castile]]; it remains in good condition in the [[Cathedral of Toledo]]. The three volumes are exhibited in the Cathedral Treasury, making this 3 volume bible the easiest of all the ''bibles moralisées'' for any visitor to see, but yet it was also the most difficult for a scholar to be allowed to study.&lt;ref name="test11"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 95],&lt;/ref&gt; The number of requests the cathedral Chapter received from scholars seeking direct access to the Bible of St Louis in order to study and conduct research on a great many subjects, increased every day, so eventually the Chapter decided to produce a facsimile edition of the Bible of St Louis. After approaching different publishing houses, the project was finally entrusted to M. Moleiro Editor in Barcelona and since 2006 a complete [http://www.moleiro.com/en/biblical-books/the-bible-of-st-louis.html facsimile edition] is available.

There was also the Spanish ''Biblia moralizada'' (Biblioteca nacional de Madrid 10232) from the late 14th century, which contains independently translated passages and glosses, though it has few illuminations.&lt;ref&gt;George D. Greenia, "Bible in Spain, The Moralized." ''Medieval Iberia: an encyclopedia'', E. Michael Gerli, Samuel G. Armistead, eds. Volume 8 of Routledge encyclopedias of the Middle Ages. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003. pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The later ''Bibles moralisées''==
Of the seven ''Bibles moralisées'' only one, manuscript Français 167 in the Bibliothèque nationale de France at Paris, has survived in its complete form. Français 167 can be traced almost without a break from its creation in Paris for King [[John II of France]] in 1349-52 up until now.&lt;ref name="test15"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées,221],&lt;/ref&gt;  The sixth of the ''Bibles moralisées'' is known now as MS Additional 18719 and is the least known of the seven, and is the work of well known late thirteenth-century English artist.&lt;ref name="test16"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées,189],&lt;/ref&gt;  Français 166 is the last of the seven fully illustrated ''Bibles moralisées''.&lt;ref name="test17"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 251]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date and Locations==

Historians still dispute the time, place and the intended readers of the first two bibles moralisées, though consensus seems to believe that they were created during the first three decades of the thirteenth century in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Tachau, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==The theories behind the commissioning of the ''Bibles moralisées''==

# There is no precise date for Vienna 2554, yet there is agreement that the manuscript is dated in the mid-thirteenth century, probably 1250s or 1260s. Vienna 2554 was written in approximately 1208 to 1215 in old French, it is theorized to have been commissioned by Phillip II Augustus, for his son, Louis VIII or his bride.&lt;ref name="test19"&gt;[Tachau, “God's Compass and Vana Curiositas”, 7],&lt;/ref&gt;   One expert on this subject believes this piece originated in Champagne, France.&lt;ref name="test20"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 50],&lt;/ref&gt; A point of reference for the dating of Vienna 2554 is the image of a mature looking bearded king at the end of Vienna 1179. This image was probably created before 1226 when Louis IX succeeded his father Louis VIII.&lt;ref name="test21"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 51],&lt;/ref&gt;  The date of the Vienna 1179 manuscript is close to Vienna 2554, both were made after 1219.&lt;ref name="test22"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 90],&lt;/ref&gt;
# An accepted theory regarding Toledo is that it was created on the orders of Blanche of Castile for Louis IX, this may be in connection to his marriage to Marguerite of Provence in 1234 majorite.&lt;ref name="test23"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 183],&lt;/ref&gt;
# Oxford-Paris-London was probably also created on orders of Blanche of Castile for a related circumstance during approximately the same time period. Due to the fact that organization for Louis` marriage began in 1233 this may be the time period when this manuscript was started.&lt;ref name="test24"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 185],&lt;/ref&gt;
# There is debate as to whether MS Additional 18719 (Add. 18719) was created at the end of the thirteenth century or the beginning of the fourteenth.&lt;ref name="test25"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 190],&lt;/ref&gt;
# Français 166 came to be in the royal collection by 1518, how it got there remains unknown, though it has been theorized that Aymar of Poitiers may have given manuscripts to King Charles VIII while he was serving in Provence.&lt;ref name="test26"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 284],&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Artists of the ''Bibles moralisées''==
In the ''Bibles moralisées'' all the artists who worked on the manuscripts could not be identified, at times the number of artists who worked on a manuscript could be distinguished. For example, in the Add. 18719 manuscript, the illustrations were created by a number of craftsmen with speed and sloppiness, borders are completed crudely and in freehand.&lt;ref name="test27"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 202],&lt;/ref&gt;   Meanwhile, in Français 167 fifteen artists were distinguished.&lt;ref name="test28"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 232],&lt;/ref&gt;   Français 166 is different in this regard, because some of the artists were identified. Three of the five artists of Français166 were identified, including young Master of the Psalter of Jeanne de Laval, Maitre de Jouvenel, and the Master of the Geneva Boccaccio. These artists did not work at the same time but rather picking up where the one before stopped.&lt;ref name="test29"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 279],&lt;/ref&gt;   There is a possible connection between the Limbourg brothers in 1402 -1404 and the illustrations within Français 166 first three quires.&lt;ref name="test30"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 251],&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical Analysis===
In the four early ''Bibles moralisées'', only one side of each page of parchment was used; this procedure increased the size of the volume as well as made the creation of these bibles very expensive.&lt;ref name="test36"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 13],&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the earlier ''Bibles moralisées'', Add. 18719 and other later ''Bibles moralisées'' used both sides of the parchment, hence costs as well as size of the manuscript was decreased. This change allowed for a more convenient one volume manuscript. Although this change may signal that money was a factor when creating later manuscripts.&lt;ref name="test37"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 192],&lt;/ref&gt;

The text/picture blocks in the ''Bibles Moralisées'' are striking for their symmetry. Each of the pages hold 8 medallions with painted gold backgrounds, these 8 medallions are arranged in pairs, so 4 rows of two medallions. Where the medallions touch one another a stylized flower joins the two, similar flowers mark where the medallions touch the outer frame and the spaces between the medallions are decorated using squares placed over quatrefoils, in these there are painted angel busts over a gold “ground”.&lt;ref name="test38"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 28],&lt;/ref&gt;    Each of the paintings within the medallions held figures that were painted on a gold leaf background, and are set on a patterned ground of blue or rose brown.&lt;ref&gt;Tachau, 39&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, in BnF MS Français 9561 129 pages are taken up with the Old Testament. Of these the earlier ones are divided horizontally in the centre, and it is the upper part of the page that contains the picture illustrative of some Old Testament event. The lower part represents a corresponding scene from the New Testament. further on in the volume, three pictures appear in the upper part of the page, and three below. Seventy-six pages at the end of the volume are devoted to depicting the lives of Jesus Christ and the Blessed Virgin.

In most of the ''Bibles moralisées'', evidence shows that scribes completed the text after the decorations were completed. The text supplemented the images, being similar to a caption. This can be seen most obviously where the text goes over the gilding or the borders that had been painted for the text to fit in.&lt;ref name="test40"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 30],&lt;/ref&gt;  A difference between MS Additional 18719 and the earlier ''Bibles moralisées'' is that MS Additional 18719 (and Add.18719) followed the usual procedure for manuscript illumination, where the scribes worked first and then the artists added images.&lt;ref name="test41"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 199],&lt;/ref&gt;

Français 166 copies the layout and text that is used in Français 167.  Meanwhile, Vienna 1179 and Toledo are very similar, at times the two be told apart in photographs, since they consist of the same layout.&lt;ref name="test62"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the bibles moralisées, p.96],&lt;/ref&gt;   Français 167 is similar to Add. 18719 in that unlike the other ''Bibles moralisées''  they both sides of the parchment sheets.&lt;ref name="test63"/&gt;

===State of Preservation===
Almost all of the manuscripts dated to the medieval period have been rebound. For example, Add. 18719 was rebound in modern times the stitching of the new binding is characteristic of the tight stitch technique that was used by the British Museum in the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="test42"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 191],&lt;/ref&gt;

Vienna 1179 was badly damaged by water at an early date; the damage was not equal to all pages but sufficient to require the rewriting of all the texts positioned in the upper part of the affected pages. This rewriting can be witnessed in that the scribe who restored the texts on Ruth was not the original scribe, his work was not angular and appeared more the inscriptions used in Toledo pr Oxford-Paris London, two other bibles of the ''bibles moralisées'', hence this damage was caused after the manuscript was completed.&lt;ref name="test43"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 57],&lt;/ref&gt;

Français 167 went through an early restoration, due to extensive water damage. Three sides of the parchment leaves had been cut off in the majority of the book and replacements strips were glued on, also the text was inked again in certain places that had been affected by the replacement strips. The images that were replaced were created to imitate the originals and have been identified as having been completed by a master working for King Charles V around 1370-1380.&lt;ref name="test44"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 236],&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the parts of Français 166 that survived were never fully completed.&lt;ref name="test45"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 255],&lt;/ref&gt;  All the aspects of Français 166, such as the headers, drawing of the frames, paintings etc., are all in different stages of completion at different points in the manuscript.&lt;ref name="test46"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées,258],&lt;/ref&gt;  Add. 18719 was entirely illustrated using drawings, this brings up questions about whether it was left unfinished.&lt;ref name="test47"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 215],&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style===
One of the artist who illustrated Add. 18719, identified only as artist E, used exceptional skills in his drawings. His figures were tall and thin with elongated necks. The figures are clothed in drapery that hangs and shows heavy angular folds. The heads sit at odd angles on the necks, often tilted sharply. The figures have broad foreheads and small chins. This artist’s work was compared to the Ashridge Comestor, British Library, MS Royal 3.D.VI, which is a different manuscript.&lt;ref name="test48"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 209],&lt;/ref&gt;  The style used by artist E is reminiscent of the Carolingian Rheims School of art. The Rheims school also used elongated figures, with long necks and figures. The heads of some of the sketches also sit peculiarly on the shoulders and draperies in which the figures are clothed also have angular folds. The Rheims school of art produced art that gave much feeling of motion.

The early Bibles moralisées are an example of the move away from the Byzantine influences, this movement is part of the early gothic art movement. The early gothic style lasted until the middle of the thirteenth century and is characterized by a softer and more realistic style than the Byzantine influenced style. “In France the style is particularly noticeable in a series of magnificent Bibles Moralisées ... done probably for the French court c. 1230–40.”&lt;ref name="test49"&gt;[Martindale, Early Gothic],&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
The Vienna 2554 frontispiece is famous and has often been reproduced. This frontispiece shows God`s figure bent while in the work of creation. “There is no close iconographic antecedent for this image.” In this image God is utilizing a huge pair of compasses, which are carefully balanced so as to draw and define. God’s left hand seems to be in the process of putting the disk that is the cosmos into motion. In a broadly read study of Gothic architecture by Otto Von Simpson, this image is titled “The Creator as Architect,” this theme has been important from Plato and onward. Yet the meaning of this frontispiece has been widely debated.&lt;ref name="test50"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 47],&lt;/ref&gt;  Vienna 1179 also has a full page creator image. In this image God is seated on a backless throne and he is holding the orb of the universe in his lap. With his right hand he turns the compasses. In this image he is enclosed within a rectangular frame by a mandorla supported at the corners by four flying angels.&lt;ref name="test51"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the Bibles moralisées, 87],&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea of god as a creator, with images of god holding compasses has been reproduced in several of the Bibles moralisées and many debates have surrounded the meaning and origin of this idea.

===Codicological Information===

The ''Bibles moralisées'' were created on high quality parchment paper. Each of the bibles was one of the most expensive books that had been created within medieval Europe. All of the bibles were created on large sheets of high- quality parchment in which the work was only done on one side of each parchment.&lt;ref name="test54"&gt;[Tachau, “God's Compass and Vana Curiositas”, p.9],&lt;/ref&gt;  Expensive paint and ink was used in the creation of the ''Bibles moralisées'' as well, for example the blue that was used for the borders, backgrounds, and clothes was lapis lazuli. Few held the resources to commission these works other than royalty.&lt;ref name="test54"/&gt;  In each page of the ''Bibles moralisées'' there are eight images arranged within four columns. Each is a biblical and moralizing image that is accompanied by a text. Unlike most illuminated manuscripts where the images are secondary to the text, in these manuscripts the images are the dominant aspect, this is evident in that the manuscripts contain more than 24, 000 illustrations.&lt;ref name="test55"&gt;[Greenspoon, “The Making of the Bibles Moralisees”, p.607],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folios==

Vienna 2554 now stands apart from the other ''Bibles moralisées'' as noticeably the smallest, consisting of 131 folios.&lt;ref name="test56"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the bibles moralisées, p.12],&lt;/ref&gt;  The damage and disorder of the pages now leave little evidence of the original length of the volume.&lt;ref name="test57"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the bibles moralisées, p.22],&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Vienna 1179 is almost two times the thickness of Vienna 2554, consisting of 246 folios.&lt;ref name="test58"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the bibles moralisées, p.58],&lt;/ref&gt;  MS Additional 18719 now consists of 311 folios, while the original total was 321 folios and 642 pages.&lt;ref name="test59"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the bibles moralisées, p.197],&lt;/ref&gt;  Français 167 is a single volume and it contains 322 numbered folios.&lt;ref name="test63"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the bibles moralisées, p.222],&lt;/ref&gt;   Lastly, Français 166 consists of one volume and 169 folios, containing 1,340 illustrations.&lt;ref name="test61"&gt;[Lowden, The making of the bibles moralisées, p.252],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other illustrated Bibles==
There is a MS. existing in the British Museum (addit. 1577) entitled "Figures de la Bible" consisting of pictures illustrating events in the Bible with short descriptive text. This is of the end of the thirteenth, or the beginning of the fourteenth, century. Of the same date is the "Historia Bibliæ metrice" which is preserved in the same library and, as the name implies, has a metrical text. The [[Velislai biblia picta]] is a 14th-century [[Bohemian]]n picture bible.

There are specimens of manuscript illustrated Bibles of earlier date. Examples are the Bible preserved in the library of the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], Rome; that of the Amiens Library (MS. 108), and that of the Royal Library of The Hague (MS. 69).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1485">A '''book rhyme''' is a short [[poem]] or [[rhyme]] that was formerly printed inside the front of a book or on the flyleaf to discourage [[theft]] or to indicate ownership.

Book rhymes were fairly common in the [[United States]] during the 18th and 19th centuries, but the printing of [[bookplate]]s pushed them out of use.

==Anti-theft warnings==
One of the most common is:
&lt;poem&gt;If this book you steal away,
What will you say
On Judgment Day?&lt;/poem&gt;

==Identification rhyme==
&lt;poem&gt;''Everytown is my dwelling-place''
''America is my nation''
''John Smith is my name''&lt;/poem&gt;

The end line has several variations,
&lt;poem&gt;''And Christ is my salvation''
''And heaven my expectation''&lt;/poem&gt;

The title of [[Thornton Wilder]]'s novel "Heaven's My Destination" and [[Alfred Bester]]'s novel ''[[The Stars My Destination]]'' play on the final line.

A typical example of a book rhyme features prominently in [[M. R. James|M.R. James']] ghost story ''[[A Warning to the Curious]]'':

&lt;poem&gt;''Nathaniel Ager is my name and England is my nation,
''Seaburgh is my dwelling-place and Christ is my salvation,''
''When I am dead and in my Grave, and all my bones are rotton,''
''I hope the Lord will think on me when I am long forgotton.''&lt;/poem&gt;

The '''Catacombs of San Gennaro''' are underground [[Early Christianity|paleo-Christian]] burial and worship sites in [[Naples]], [[Italy]], carved out of [[tuff]], a porous stone. They are situated in the northern part of the city, on the slope leading up to {{ill|Capodimonte (Naples)|it|Capodimonte (Napoli)|lt=Capodimonte}}, consisting of two levels, San Gennaro Superiore, and San Gennaro Inferiore.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259225675_Environmental_Monitoring_of_the_St_Gennaro_and_St_Gaudioso_catacombs_in_Naples|title=Environmental Monitoring of the St. Gennaro and St. Gaudioso catacombs in Naples (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catacombs lie under the [[Rione Sanità]] neighborhood of [[Naples]], sometimes called the "Valley of the Dead".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebanista|first=Carlo|title=Aree funerarie e luoghi di culto in rupe: le cavità artificiali campane tra tarda antichità e medioevo, in Atti VI Convegno Nazionale di Speleologia in Cavità Artificiali, Napoli, 30 maggio-2 giugno 2008 («Opera ipogea», 1/2, 2008), pp. 117-144|url=https://www.academia.edu/1477008/Aree_funerarie_e_luoghi_di_culto_in_rupe_le_cavit%C3%A0_artificiali_campane_tra_tarda_antichit%C3%A0_e_medioevo_in_Atti_VI_Convegno_Nazionale_di_Speleologia_in_Cavit%C3%A0_Artificiali_Napoli_30_maggio-2_giugno_2008_Opera_ipogea_1_2_2008_pp._117-144|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is now easily identified by the large church of [[Madre del Buon Consiglio]].

== History ==
[[File:Catacombe di San Gennaro 003.jpg|left|thumb|One of the halls with carved ''loculi.'']]
Originally, there were three separate cemeteries, dedicated, respectively, to [[Gaudiosus of Abitine|Saint Gaudiosus]] (''San Gaudioso''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napoli.com/english/sotterranea2.php napoli.com - Around Naples&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90237 San Gaudioso di Abitine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Severus of Naples|Saint Severus]] (''San Severo'') and [[St. Januarius]] (''San Gennaro''). These [[catacombs]] in Naples are different from their Roman counterparts in that they have more spacious passageways along two levels. The lower level is the oldest, going back to the 3rd-4th century and may actually be the site of an earlier pre-Christian cemetery later ceded to the new sect. It apparently became an important religious burial site only after the entombment there of Bishop [[Agrippinus of Naples|Agrippinus]].  The second level was the one expanded so as to encompass the other two adjacent cemeteries.

The foundation of [[San Gennaro extra Moenia]] is connected with the Catacombs of San Gennaro, the largest Christian catacomb complex in southern Italy. The first structure was probably the result of the fusion of two ancient burial sites, one from the 2nd century CE that contained the remains of [[Saint Agrippinus of Naples]], the first [[patron saint]] of Naples, and the site from the 4th century CE that contained the remains of [[St. Januarius]], the  patron saint of the city.

The site was consecrated to Gennaro (Januarius) in the fifth century on the occasion of the entombment there of his remains, which were later removed to the [[Cathedral of Naples]] by [[John IV (bishop of Naples)|Bishop John IV]] (842-849) in the 9th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As the burial areas grew around the remains of Gennaro so did underground places of worship for the growing Christian faith. An early example of religious use of the catacombs is the [[Basilica]] of Agrippinus dating to the fourth century. An altar and chair are carved from the tuff creating a meeting place for worshipers. Other ritual spaces included a [[confessional]], [[baptismal font]], a carved tuff table used as a seat for a consignatorium (area for [[confirmation]]), or “oleorum” table for holy oils, and possibly, monastic and hermit cells.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Until the eleventh century the catacombs were the burial site of Neapolitan bishops, including [[Quodvultdeus|Quodvoltdeus]], the exiled bishop of Carthage who died in 450 AD. Between the 13th and 18th century, the catacombs were the victim of severe looting. Restoration of the catacombs was made possible only after the transfer of skeletal remains to another cemetery. During WWII the catacombs were used by the local population as a place of shelter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Catacombs were reopened in 1969 by the Archbishop of Naples and modern excavations started in 1971.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gino_Iannace/publication/256457813_The_acoustic_of_the_Catacombs_of_San_Gennaro_in_Naples/links/0046352385aa897a91000000.pdf|title=The Acoustic of The Catacombs of "San Gennaro" in Naples|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of burials ==
The types of tombs include [[Loculus (architecture)|loculi]], [[Arcosolium|arcosoli]], pits dug in the ground, and less often, [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] made of tuff, or recycled marble and stone from older graves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The loculi are aligned vertically and the most simple style of burial found in the catacombs but not indicative of the status of the deceased. Arcosoli, made for family funeral areas, are built into the walls of the galleries and cubicles and are more sophisticated than the loculi. Sometimes decorated with [[mosaic]]s or [[fresco]]es, the burials may be stacked horizontally. This type of burial is often found in Sicilian catacombs as well, and can be described as a “Siracusa” burial and is often found in Greek areas of catacombs. Occasionally child burials are found in the bottom wall of the [[lunette]], another example of the efficient use of space in the catacombs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Oil lamps ==
Approximately 200 oil lamps dating from late antiquity to the Middle Ages have been found in the catacombs. Included in the findings are 54 [[African red slip ware|African red slip lamps]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A thorough study of all the lamps will eventually indicate trade routes from the time period as well as the types of people using the catacombs for burial and ritual purposes. The oldest oil lamps found date back to the second half of the third century and were made in Naples.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaudio|first=Antonio Del|last2=Ebanista|first2=Carlo|title=Le lucerne di età tardoantica e altomedievale dalla catacomba di S.

'''Chip art''', also known as '''silicon art''', '''chip graffiti''' or '''silicon doodling''', refers to microscopic artwork built into [[integrated circuits]], also called chips or ICs.  Since ICs are printed by [[photolithography]], not constructed a component at a time, there is no additional cost to include features in otherwise unused space on the chip.  Designers have used this freedom to put all sorts of artwork on the chips themselves, from designers' simple initials to rather complex drawings.  Given the small size of chips, these figures cannot be seen without a [[microscope]].  Chip graffiti is sometimes called the hardware version of [[Easter egg (media)|software easter eggs]].

Prior to 1984, these doodles also served a practical purpose.  If a competitor produced a similar chip, and examination showed it contained the same doodles, then this was strong evidence that the design was copied (a [[copyright]] violation) and not independently derived.  A 1984 revision of the US copyright law (the [[Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984]]) made all [[mask work|chip masks automatically copyrighted]], with exclusive rights to the creator, and similar rules apply in most other countries that manufacture ICs.  Since an exact copy is now automatically a copyright violation, the doodles serve no useful purpose.

==Creating chip art==
[[Image:ChipWorksLandShark.jpg|left|thumb|Image of a [[Land Shark (Saturday Night Live)|Land Shark]] from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' inside an [[Analog Devices]] AD1939 chip.]]
Integrated Circuits are constructed from multiple layers of material, typically [[silicon]], [[silicon dioxide]] ([[glass]]), and [[aluminium|aluminum]]. The composition and thickness of these layers give them their distinctive color and appearance. These elements created an irresistible palette for IC design and layout engineers. 

The creative process involved in the design of these chips, a strong sense of pride in their work, and an artistic temperament combined compels people to want to mark their work as their own. It is very common to find initials, or groups of initials on chips. This is the design engineer's way of "signing" his or her work.

Often this creative artist's instinct extends to the inclusion of small pictures or icons. These may be images of significance to the designers, comments related to the chip's function, [[inside jokes]], or even [[satirical]] references. Because of the difficulty in verifying their existence, chip art has also been the subject of online hoaxes (e.g. the never-seen "[[Bill Gates|bill]] sux" comment on a [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] chip&amp;mdash;the reputed "photo" showing the inscription is a hoax&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.snopes.com/business/hidden/chipshot.asp an account of "Bill Sux" as an urban legend.]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The mass production of these works of art as parasites on the body of a commercial IC goes unnoticed by most observers and is discouraged by semiconductor corporations, primarily from the fear that the presence of the artwork (which is clearly unneeded) will interfere with some necessary function in the chip or design flow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/design/the-secret-art-of-chip-graffiti The Secret Art of Chip Graffiti] ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' article on chip artwork, by H. Goldstein, Volume: 39, Issue: 3, Mar 2002, pp. 50-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some laboratories have started collaborating with artists or directly producing books and exhibits with the micrographs of these chips. Such is the case of [[Harvard]] chemist [[George M. Whitesides|George Whitesides]], who collaborated with pioneer photographer [[Felice Frankel]] to publish ''On the Surface of Things'', a highly praised photography book on experiments from (mostly) the Whitesides lab. Also, the laboratory of [[Albert Folch Folch|Albert Folch]] (who, perhaps not coincidentally, works in [[BioMEMS]], the same field as George Whitesides) at the [[University of Washington]]'s Bioengineering Dept. has a highly popular online gallery with more than 1,700 free [[BioMEMS]]-related chip art micrographs and has already produced three art exhibits in the Seattle area, with online sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/afolch/FolchLabART.html Folch Lab ART Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

While bedridden with illness in 2009, Mellor occupied his time by writing a novel about an [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] [[Offender profiling|criminal profiler's]] hunt for a serial killer terrorizing Canada, but partway into the story, Mellor realized that he had very little knowledge of any actual Canadian serial killers beyond [[Clifford Olson]], [[Paul Bernardo]], [[Karla Homolka]], and [[Robert Pickton]]. While looking up other cases, Mellor, inspired by both the lack of a single comprehensive source regarding serial murder in Canada and the high-profile arrest of [[Russell Williams (criminal)|Russell Williams]] in 2010, decided to abandon his original idea for a book in favor of new one, an encyclopedia about serial homicide in Canada.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.definingcanada.ca/2012/02/13/qa-with-lee-mellor-author-of-cold-north-killers/|title = Q&amp;A with Lee Mellor, author of ''Cold North Killers''|publisher = [[Internet Archive]]|website = definingcanada.ca|accessdate = 14 August 2017|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140314102744/http://www.definingcanada.ca/2012/02/13/qa-with-lee-mellor-author-of-cold-north-killers/|archivedate = 14 March 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pod"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.saultstar.com/2012/03/12/book-on-serial-killers-touches-on-local-murders|title = Book on serial killers touches on local murders|last = Della-Mattia|first = Elaine|publisher = ''[[Sault Star]]''|date = 12 March 2012|website = saultstar.com|accessdate = 14 August 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Mellor researched seventy-five cases for the book, but at the behest of the editors at [[Dundurn Press]] reduced the number of them included in it to sixty due to spatial constraints. Mellor later included two of the excised cases—the [[Montreal]] child murders of 1981-92 and the "[[Nahanni National Park Reserve|Headless Valley]]" murders 1908-46—in the third issue of his [[online magazine]] ''Serial Killer Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite magazine|author = Lee Mellor|title = Introduction to Unsolved in North America|magazine = Serial Killer Quarterly|location = Canada|publisher = Grinning Man Press|date = Summer 2014|language = English|volume = 1|issue = 3|page = }} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

Each of the book's four sections cover different aspects of serial murder, and are divided into chapters that are each about a different Canadian serial killer. In-between each section are passages relating to [[Russell Williams (criminal)|Russell Williams]], who was active and arrested in the same area where Mellor was residing while he was in the process of writing ''Cold North Killers''.

The first section showcases four of Canada's earliest serial killers—[[Edward H. Rulloff]], Joseph LaPage, [[Theodore Durrant]], and [[Wineville Chicken Coop Murders|Gordon Stewart Northcott]]—and then delves into the [[nature versus nurture]] debate by scrutinizing the lives of [[Russell Maurice Johnson|Russell Johnson]], Doug Moore, [[Peter Woodcock]], and [[Clifford Olson]]. [[Modus operandi]] and [[signature crime]] are then discussed by looking into the crimes committed by [[Léopold Dion]], [[William Patrick Fyfe]], [[Earle Nelson]], Serge Archambault, Sam Pirrera, and William Dean Christenson, with [[victimology]] then being explored through examination of [[John Martin Crawford]], Donald Sherman Staley, and [[Allan Legere]], as well as the unsolved Toronto gay village murders of 1967-68 and the [[Highway of Tears murders]] of 1969-2011.

The next section begins with a focus on the three different categories of serial killer: organized, [[Disorganized offender|disorganized]], and mixed (someone who displays both organized and disorganized traits). Angelo Colalillo and David Threinen are used as examples of organized offenders, Braeden Nugent and Carl Hall as examples of disorganized offenders, and Donald Armstrong and Danny Wood as examples of mixed offenders. Next, sub-categories are explored, beginning with  "[[Serial killer#Visionary|visionary]]" killer [[Peter Woodcock#Imprisonment|Bruce Hamill]] followed by "[[Serial killer#Mission-oriented|missionary]]" killer Ronald Sears, and then the three varieties of "[[Serial killer#Hedonistic|hedonist]]" killer; Henry Williams and Christian Magee are presented as instances of "hedonist-[[Lust serial killers|lust]]" killers, James Greenidge and [[Michael Wayne McGray]] as "hedonist-[[Thrill killing|thrill]]" killers, and [[insurance fraud]]sters Charles Kembo and Sukhwinder Dhillon, "black widow" [[Melissa Ann Shepard]], and [[Baby farming|baby farmers]] [[Lila and William Young]] as "hedonist-[[Serial killer#Comfort (profit)|comfort]]" killers. After chapters on "[[Serial killer#Power/control|power/control]]" killers David Snow&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = https://www.orangeville.com/news-story/8090086--tbt-remembering-orangeville-murderer-david-snow-who-police-dubbed-the-house-hermit/|title = #TBT: Remembering Orangeville murderer David Snow, who police dubbed the House Hermit|last = Halliday|first = Chris|publisher = ''Orangeville Banner''|date = 24 January 2018|website = orangeville.com|accessdate = 19 August 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Keith Hunter Jesperson]], the section concludes with passages on "[[Angel of mercy (criminology)|angels of death]]" [[Thomas Neill Cream]] and Robert MacGregor.

The third section centers around techniques that are used by the authorities to help them investigate serial killers. [[Offender profiling]] was employed in the Brian Arp, [[Paul Bernardo]], and the still-unsolved Edmonton serial killer cases, while advances in DNA analysis resulted in cold case murders being positively attributed to Ronald West, [[Gerald Thomas Archer]], and Alan Craig MacDonald. Crime-solving methods pioneered by Canada are then showcased; [[metal detector]]s were used to uncover Michael Vescio's discarded shell [[Cartridge (firearms)|casings]] in what was the first instance of the devices being used to assist with a criminal investigation, while bite-mark analysis was used to help convict [[Wayne Boden]] in what was one of the earliest usages of [[forensic dentistry]] in North America. In 1998, [[Kim Rossmo]] used [[geographic profiling]] to discern the presence of a serial killer operating in Vancouver's [[Downtown Eastside]]. Rossmo's data, which the [[Vancouver Police Department]] refused to look into, was later vindicated by the arrest of [[Robert Pickton]] in 2002.

The first half of the book's final section is dedicated to discussing violence against Canadian sex workers, and how many of their deaths seemingly go unreported and under-investigated, possibly due to both their profession and the fact that many of them are [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Aborogine]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-taken-who-qualifies-as-a-serial-killer-and-more-on-the-data-behind-the-project/article27443307/|title = The Taken: Who qualifies as a serial killer and more on the data behind the project|last1 = McClearn|first1 = Matthew|last2 = Blaze Baum|first2 = Kathryn|publisher = ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|date = 23 November 2015|website = theglobeandmail.com|accessdate = 9 April 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; The cases examined here are all unsolved ones, and include the [[Sasquatch Mountain Resort|Hemlock Valley]] murders of 1995, the Calgary prostitute murders of 1991-93, the Prostitutes-in-the-Lake killings of 1994-97, and the Niagara prostitute murders of 1995-2006. The second half of the section presents six cases ([[Karla Homolka]], Allan Sweeney, Melvin Stanton, Paul Cecil Gillis, Michael Hector, and [[Gilbert Paul Jordan]]) that Mellor regards as having been notably "botched" in some way, such as through investigative, judicial, or bureaucratic incompetence, apathy, or [[red tape]]. The concluding chapter consists of brief write-ups on Noel Winters, Allan George Foster, Paul Alan Hachey, Raymond Russell, Donald Falkner, Davey Mato Butorac, Camille Cleroux, [[Cody Legebokoff]], and Mark Garfield Moore, all offenders who did not receive longer entries in the book due to either a lack of easily accessible information about their crimes, or because the murders that they committed were only unearthed while the book was undergoing its final editing phase.

== Controversy ==

The [[Vancouver Public Library]] sent their copy of ''Cold North Killers'' to the hate-speech squad at the [[Vancouver Police Department]] for analyses in 2013 after receiving complaints about its content from a concerned citizen, who wrote, "There is no educational benefit in introducing a 10-year-old child who might pick this book up... to the ideas contained in it." The authorities concluded that there was nothing illegal about the book's content, and the Vancouver Public Library subsequently issued the formal statement, "This work is disturbing to read, but this does not affect the library's obligation to protect the right of a citizen to read this book."&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.theprovince.com/news/What+THAT+book+doing+library+Seuss+among+authors+targeted+removal/9828476/story.html|title = What's THAT book doing in the library?

==Performing arts==
[[Image:KennedyCtr.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kennedy Center]]]]
{{main|Theater in Washington, D.C.}}
Washington is a major national center for the arts, with many venues for the performing arts in the city.  Theater dates back to the early 19th century when a theater was established in Samuel Blodgett Jr's Great Hotel on E Street in 1800, soon after the capital was relocated to Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="meersman-p527"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meersman, Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |date=1980 |volume=50 |pages= 527}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]] opened in 1835 on E Street, near the [[White House]].  [[DAR Constitution Hall]] opened in 1929, and remained the city's primary concert hall until the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] opened in 1971.&lt;ref name="meersman-p527"/&gt;

DAR Constitution Hall, National Theatre, and other venues remained [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] throughout the early part of the 20th century.  [[Contralto]] [[Marian Anderson]] was barred from performing at Constitution Hall in 1939, instead performing at the Lincoln Memorial to large crowds.  The [[U Street Corridor]] was the center of [[African American]] culture in Washington, D.C.  The [[Lincoln Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Lincoln Theatre]] hosted the likes of [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]] on [[U Street Corridor|U Street]] (known as "Washington's Black Broadway") prior to the 1968 riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Miracle on the Potomac |author=Becker, Ralph E. |date=1990 |publisher=Bartleby Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arena Stage]], one of the first non-profit regional theaters in the nation produces an eight-show season ranging from classics to world premieres, dedicated to the American canon of theater. The [[Shakespeare Theatre Company]] is regarded as one of the world's great Shakespeare troupes. Numerous other professional theaters, such as the Studio Theatre and Woolly Mammoth, and venues such as the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]], make the city a major theater center.  The Kennedy Center hosts the [[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Washington National Opera]], the [[Washington Ballet]], and a variety of other musical and stage performances.

Notable local music clubs include [[Madam's Organ Blues Bar]] in [[Adams Morgan]]; Blues Alley in Georgetown; the [[Eighteenth Street Lounge]] in the [[Dupont Circle]] district; and the [[the Black Cat (nightclub)|Black Cat]], the [[9:30 Club]], the [[Bohemian Caverns]] jazz club, the Twins jazz clubs, all in the [[U Street]] NW area. The U Street area actually contains more than two dozen bars, clubs, and restaurants that feature jazz either nightly or several times a week.  Notable Washingtonians in the entertainment industry include singer-songwriter [[Marvin Gaye]], film actress [[Helen Hayes]], comedian [[David Chappelle]], musician [[Duke Ellington]], filmmaker [[Ted Salins]] and two members of [[Jefferson Airplane]]: guitarist [[Jorma Kaukonen]] and bass player [[Jack Casady]].

==Music==
{{main|Music of Washington, D.C.}}
D.C. has its own native music genre, called [[go-go]], a post-funk, percussion-driven flavor of [[R&amp;B]] that blends live sets with relentless dance rhythms, so-called because they "go and go and go." The most accomplished practitioner of go-go was D.C. bandleader [[Chuck Brown]], who brought go-go to the brink of national recognition with his 1979 LP ''[[Bustin' Loose (Chuck Brown album)|Bustin' Loose]]''. Go-Go band and Washington natives [[Experience Unlimited]] (E.U.) hit the American pop charts in 1988 with their memorable dance tune "[[Da Butt]]" Other notable go-go bands include [[Rare Essence]], [[Trouble Funk]], [[Junkyard Band]], [[Backyard Band]], and the [[Northeast Groovers]].

Washington was an important center in the genesis of [[punk rock]] in the United States. Punk bands of note from Washington include [[Tru Fax &amp; the Insaniacs]], [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]], [[Bad Brains]], and [[Minor Threat]]. Washingtonians continue to support punk bands, long after the punk movement's popularity peaked. The region also has a significant [[indie rock]] history and was home to [[TeenBeat Records|TeenBeat]], [[Dischord Records]] and [[Simple Machines Records|Simple Machines]], among other indie record labels.

Washington is also home to [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts]], founded in 1974 and part of the [[District of Columbia Public Schools|DC Public School System]]. Some other notable music education organizations which are located and founded in Washington include the [[DC Youth Orchestra Program]] founded in 1960; [[Blues Alley]], founded in 1985; and the Levine School of Music, founded in 1976.

==Television shows==
There have been several television series that have featured the District. Most of these have been related to government (e.g., ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' and ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'') or security organizations (''[[The District]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]''). Other programs had the nation's capital as a secondary focus, telling stories on their own that were not always tied to the infrastructure of the government either in the district or for the country. For instance, ''[[Murphy Brown]]'' focused on the lives of the reporters of the (fictional) Washington-based television newsmagazine, ''FYI''. The soap opera ''[[Capitol (TV series)|Capitol]]'' allowed for stories about political intrigue alongside the traditional class struggle sagas. The sitcom ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]'' portrayed the life of the [[African American]] majority as seen through the eyes of residents in a Washington apartment building. There are also many movies shot and filmed in the city yearly.  ''[[Cory in the House]]'' on [[The Disney Channel]] uses Washington, D.C. as a backdrop.

Other professional and semi-professional teams based in D.C. include the [[Australian rules football|USAFL]] [[Baltimore Washington Eagles]], the [[National Women's Football Association|NWFA]] [[D.C. Divas]], the [[Minor League Football]] [[D.C. Explosion]], the [[Washington Rugby Football Club|Washington RFC]] [[rugby union]] team of the [[Rugby Super League (United States)|Rugby Super League]], as well as a host of others playing in the [[Potomac Rugby Union]] and the [[cricket|Washington Cricket League]]. It was also home to the [[Women's United Soccer Association|WUSA]] [[Washington Freedom]], from 1987 to 1989 home of the [[Major Indoor Lacrosse League]]'s [[Washington Wave]], and during the [[2000 NLL season|2000]]–[[2002 NLL season|2002]] [[National Lacrosse League|NLL]] seasons, the [[Washington Power]] was based in the city. In [[rugby league]], the [[Washington, D.C. Slayers]] play in the [[American National Rugby League]].

There were two [[Major League Baseball]] teams named the Washington Senators in the early and mid-20th century, which left to become respectively the [[Minnesota Twins]] and the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. In the [[Washington Senators (1891–99)|19th century]], the town was home to teams called the Washington Nationals, Washington Statesmen, and Washington Senators on and off from the 1870s to the turn of the century.

Washington was home to several [[Negro League baseball]] teams, including the [[Homestead Grays]], [[Washington Black Senators]], [[Washington Elite Giants]], [[Washington Pilots]], and [[Washington Potomacs]].

The [[Capital One Arena]] in Chinatown, home to the Capitals, Mystics, Wizards and the [[Georgetown Hoyas]], is also a major venue for concerts, [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) [[professional wrestling]], and other events, having replaced the old [[Capital Centre]]. Since its opening in 1997, the arena has served as a catalyst of prosperity in Chinatown. Office buildings, high-end condominiums, restaurant chains, movie theatres, and other luxuries have sprung up around Chinatown. On the downside, the growth has forced out many Chinatown landmarks, and only a fraction of Chinatown remains "Chinese".{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

The city's soccer team, D.C. United, is the most successful franchise in MLS history, with 4 league championships and 10 total tournament victories, both league highs. The city is also considered the most passionate soccer market, with a list of people including MLS Commissioner Don Garber and TV Commentator (and former US National team and MLS star) Eric Wynalda outright declaring Washington the country's best soccer market. Washington will host the 2007 edition of MLS Cup at RFK Stadium.

Washington hosts the annual [[Legg Mason Tennis Classic]] [[tennis]] tournament that takes place at the [[Carter Barron Tennis Center]] on 17th Street.

The [[Marine Corps Marathon]] and the [[National Marathon]] are both held annually in Washington.

Additionally, most [[Baltimore]] area television stations can be seen in the Washington region. Besides being viewed clearly in the District, they can especially be seen in the suburbs of the [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|Interstate 95]] corridor between both cities. They are:

[[WMAR-TV|WMAR]] 2 ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) – [[WBAL-TV|WBAL]] 11 ([[NBC]]) – [[WJZ-TV|WJZ]] 13 ([[CBS]]) – [[WMJF-LP|WMJF]] 16 (Ind/MTV2) – [[Maryland Public Television|WMPT]] 22 / [[Maryland Public Television|WMPB]] 67 (PBS/MPB) – [[WUTB]] 24 ([[MyNetwork TV]]) – [[WBFF]] 45 ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]) – [[WNUV]] 54 (The [[The CW Television Network|CW]]) (The Tube on DT2)

The WTTG Television Tower, built in 1963, is a 214.8 metre high guyed TV mast; it is only 17.2 meters shorter than the [[Hughes Memorial Tower]]: the tallest structure in Washington, D.C. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Spanish-language television is also represented by [[Telemundo]] [[WZDC-LP]] 25 and Telefutura affiliate [[WMDO-CA]] 47, but these are [[LPTV|low-power television stations]] limited to within the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]] area. Univision's [[WFDC]] 14, however, transmits as a full power station and can be received as far north as Baltimore.

Incidentally, D.C's Univision and Telefutura stations (owned by Entravision) switched call letters on January 1, 2006; meaning that now Univision is the only Spanish station which can be seen at full power over the whole Washington metropolitan area. The Univision network moved from low-powered Channel 47/[[WMDO-CA|WMDO]] to full-powered Channel 14/[[WFDC-TV|WFDC]]; Univision's youth-oriented Telefutura network moved from 14 to 47. The change caused Univision and Telefutura to exchange channel locations on D.C. area cable TV systems, too.

[[Azteca America]] announced they would start transmitting from a new full powered Spanish-language broadcast affiliate in the region, Channel 69/[[WQAW]] on October 6, 2006, as well as its addition to local channel lineups for Comcast Cable. However it has not been seen on the air as of yet. Earliest reports from viewers do not indicate availability of its broadcasts inside the District, as far south as Prince William County, Virginia, or as far north as the Columbia/Baltimore area.

Several [[cable television]] networks have their headquarters in the Washington area including [[C-SPAN]] on Capitol Hill, [[Black Entertainment Television]] (BET) in [[Washington, D.C. (northeast)|Northeast Washington]], and [[Discovery Channel|Discovery Communications]] in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], as well as the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. Major national broadcasters and cable outlets including [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Columbia Broadcasting Service|CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]], and [[CNN]] maintain a significant presence in Washington, as do those from around the world including the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], and [[Al Jazeera]]. ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' is the only network primetime program produced in Washington.

There are several major radio stations serving the metro area, with a wide variety of musical interests. [[Contemporary music]] Station (and arguably the most popular) is [[WIHT]] 99.5 FM (Hot 99.5) located in [[Rockville, Maryland]]. [[Rock and roll|Rock]] stations include [[WTGB-FM|WTGB]] 94.7 FM ([[Adult album alternative|Triple A]]) and [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC]] 101.1 FM (alternative rock/pop). [[Urban contemporary|Urban]] stations include [[WPGC-FM|WPGC]] 95.5 FM ([[rhythmic top 40]]/urban contemporary), [[WHUR]] 96.3 FM ([[Howard University]] [[urban adult contemporary]] station), [[WMMJ]] 102.3 FM (urban adult contemporary), [[WKYS]] 93.9 FM (urban contemporary), and [[Radio CPR]] 97.5 FM (a popular [[pirate radio]] station broadcasting in the area around [[Mount Pleasant, Washington, D.C.|Mount Pleasant]], [[Adams Morgan]], and [[Columbia Heights, Washington, D.C.|Columbia Heights]]). Two major [[contemporary Christian music]] stations in the region are [[WGTS]] 91.9 FM (of [[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Park]]) and [[WPIR (FM)|WPIR]] 89.9 (of [[Warrenton, Virginia]]). Stations that concentrate on talk and sports include [[WJFK-FM|WJFK]] 106.7 FM, [[WMAL (AM)|WMAL]] 630 AM ([[conservatism|conservative]]), [[WSPZ]] 1260 AM ([[progressive talk radio|progressive talk]]), [[WOL (AM)|WOL]] 1450 AM, [[WPGC (AM)|WPGC]] 1580 AM ([[gospel]]), WTEM 980 AM (sports talk), [[WAVA-FM|WAVA]] 105.1 FM (Christian [[talk radio]]), [[WTOP-FM|WTOP]] 103.5 FM (news), and [[WWWT]] 1500 AM/107.7 FM (3WT/talk). Radio duos [[Don and Mike]] and [[Ron and Fez]] both had great success on WJFK, although the latter now broadcast on D.C.-based [[XM Satellite Radio]] via the network's New York studio.

WOL 1450 AM, WKYS 93.9 FM, and WMMJ 102.3 are owned by Washington's [[Radio One (Company)|Radio One]], the largest African American media conglomerate in the country. It was founded by Cathy Hughes, a prominent figure in Washington radio since her days at [[Howard University]]'s WHUR.

There are two [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) affiliates: [[WAMU]] 88.5 FM (NPR and [[Public Radio International]] programming, community programming, and [[BBC]] news), broadcast from the [[American University]], and [[WETA (FM)|WETA]] 90.9 FM (around-the-clock [[classical music]]). Other stations include [[WASH]] 97.1 FM ([[adult contemporary]]), [[WMZQ-FM]] 98.7 FM ([[country music]]), [[WBIG-FM|WBIG]] 100.3 FM ([[classic hits]]), [[Triple X ESPN Radio]] 92.7 FM/94.3 FM/730 AM ([[sports radio|sports talk]] station controlled by [[Washington Redskins]] owner [[Daniel Snyder]]), [[WLZL]] El Zol 99.1 FM (Latin/Tropical), [[WPRS-FM]] Praise 104.1 (gospel), [[WPFW]] 89.3 FM ([[jazz]] and progressive talk), [[WMAL-FM|WJZW]] 105.9 FM ([[smooth jazz]]), and [[WRQX]] 107.3 FM (hot adult contemporary). Additionally, most major radio stations from Baltimore can be heard in the Washington metropolitan area.

XM Satellite Radio and NPR are based in Washington. The [[Voice of America]], the U.S. government's [[international broadcasting]] service, is headquartered in Washington.

==The Latino Community in Washington, D.C.==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}

The [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] community in Washington, D.C. is one of the most thriving ones in the nation. The [[Mayor of the District of Columbia|Mayor's Office]] has a division for the Latino community called OLA (the Office of Latino Affairs).

There are several medical centers that cater to the needs of the [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking]] population. Also, there are about six newspapers in Spanish and various bilingual schools. Most government programs and facilities provide services in Spanish. The transportation system like Metro and buses offer information (e.g. brochures and announcements) in English and Spanish. There are many centers that offer services in Spanish and have special programs for the Latino community such as the [[Whitman-Walker Clinic]], the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Office of Human Services]] of the District of Columbia, most hospitals offer bilingual services including translators and bilingual staff on call twenty-four hours a day.

[[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] is heard all across the city (supermarkets, [[Starbucks]], restaurants, etc.) Bilingual staff can be found in most supermarkets, pharmacies, restaurants, laundromats, etc.

Cultural programs and events for the Latino community thrive all across the city, including frequent concerts by top Latin music artists such as [[Juanes]], [[Shakira]], [[Alejandro Fernández]], [[Juan Gabriel]], and [[Ricky Martin]]. There is also a theater company called Gala, which presents plays all year round.

The metropolitan area of Washington, D.C. has the largest population of [[El Salvador|Salvadorans]] in the world after [[San Salvador]]. Also, there are communities from [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Colombia]], and other [[Latin American]] countries. Most universities and colleges in the area have Spanish and Latino representatives for the recruitment of Latino students. Furthermore, there are many organizations that foster the educational and professional needs of young Latino students, such as the Latin American Youth Center. There are also programs for Latinos who suffer from substance abuse, including AYUDA.

{{wiktionary|cut and paste}}

A '''cut-and-paste job''' or '''cut and paste approach''' is a [[pejorative]] reference to various kinds of work produced by "[[Cut, copy, and paste|cut and paste]]", i.e., a quick combination of pieces of text collected from various sources, a [[wikt:compilation|compilation]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cut_and_paste "Cut and paste"], Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc. accessed 26 Feb. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In application to [[book]] writing, cut and paste job implies little creativity, no [[original research]] and no new insights. It is often assumed that these books are produced by [[journalist]]s rather than experts in the subject.&lt;ref name=alliance&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_v36/ai_3146527 The Alliance. - book reviews], by Richard Brookhiser, ''[[National Review]]'', February 24, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Cut and paste jobs often have a [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] agenda and present only facts in support of a certain thesis.&lt;ref name=alliance/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Usage example (see "[[Lodge Committee]]" for the context): "[[Albert Beveridge|Beveridge]] had the last word in the "investigation" by gleaning from the record anything that remotely supported his conclusion that the war was one of the most humane ones in history and then publishing this deceitful cut-and-paste job as a separate senate document." &amp;mdash; From "Benevolent Assimilation: The American Conquest of the Philippines, 1899-1903" by [[Stuart Creighton Miller]] (1982) {{ISBN|0-300-03081-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the phrase "[[Cut, copy, and paste|cut and paste]]" today is associated with computer user interface, the phrase predates the computers. For example, a 1969 book ''The Roman Years of Margaret Fuller: A Biography'' by [[Joseph Jay Deiss]] says: "It was a cut-and-paste job, with the scissors acting as censor's shears. Suspect material was deleted - whole sections snipped from letters"&lt;ref&gt;''The Roman Years of Margaret Fuller: A Biography'' by [[Joseph Jay Deiss]] (1969) [https://books.google.com/books?id=GndBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22cut-and-paste+job%22&amp;dq=%22cut-and-paste+job%22&amp;lr=&amp;pgis=1 p.225]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dovedale by Moonlight''''' is one of five paintings by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] which uses the picturesque valley of [[Dovedale]] as its subject. These paintings were sometimes made as pairs with one showing the view by day and the other by moonlight. Wright admitted that he had not observed this scene directly, "Moon lights &amp; fire lights are but a sort of work with me for I cant with impunity go out at night and study the former, &amp; the latter I have seen but once, and at a time too, when I thought not of painting such effects."&lt;ref name=oberlin2&gt;{{cite web|last=Wieseman|first=M.E.|title=Joseph Wright of Derby (English Derby 1734 – 1797) Dovedale by Moonlight, ca. 1784–85|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/Wright.htm|work=Modern Landscapes|publisher=Allen Memorial Art Gallert|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Study for a painting of Dovedale.jpg|thumb|left|A preparatory sketch for these paintings (now in [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]]). The unusual trees are said to be ''after'' [[Alexander Cozens]]. ]]

{{main|Dovedale}}
[[Dovedale]] is a very popular [[valley|dale]] in Staffordshire and Wright's home county of [[Derbyshire]]. Admired in Wright's time, it has been owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] since 1924 and made available to the many [[Peak District]] visitors.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.derbyshireuk.net/dovedale.html|title=Dovedale in Derbyshire and the Peak District|publisher=www.derbyshireuk.net|accessdate=21 October 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Dovedale is named for the [[River Dove, Central England|River Dove]] and it is {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} long.&lt;ref name=peak&gt;{{cite web|title=Dovedale Fact Sheet|url=http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/79235/factsheet12-dovedale.pdf|publisher=peakdistrict.gov.uk|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright's paintings appear to be from nature, but in a letter of 1787 he said that he had observed moonlight and firelight only once at night and this was some time before he decided to create this series of paintings.&lt;ref name=oberlin2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Benedict|title=Joseph Wright of Derby: painter of light, Volume 1|year=1968|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ms09AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=alchemist+wright+joseph#v=onepage&amp;q=alchemist%20wright%20joseph&amp;f=false|pages=87–88|isbn=978-0-7100-6284-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However his preparatory sketches show that he was using a mixture of studies and chance. The unusual reversal of light and shade in the trees in the sketch of Dovedale is said to be after using techniques created by the Russian born [[Alexander Cozens]]. Wright owned paintings by Cozens who taught his students to paint landscapes. He told them to create blots on paper and then use these as inspiration for the composition.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner |first=Christopher |title=The Deliberate Accident |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue21/blotsturner.htm |publisher=The Tate |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903112235/http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue21/blotsturner.htm |archivedate=3 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There are no known Derbyshire landscapes by Wright that are dateable before 1786. One of the problems is that many of Wright's paintings are dated by consulting Wright's accounts in his notebook. In the case of his English landscapes this has proved challenging. It is known that some of the Dovedale pictures are some of his earliest English landscapes.
Wright frequently repeated a popular subject in his paintings as he did with his [[Virgil's Tomb (Joseph Wright paintings)|Virgil's Tomb]] pictures and his [[The Blacksmith's Shop|Blacksmith's Shop]] paintings. In this case he made five very similar paintings. The version at Oberlin College was painted in 1785 to 1786 and sold to [[Edward Miller? Mundy (fl. 1786)|Edward Mundy]] of [[Shipley Hall]].&lt;ref name=oberlin&gt;{{cite web|last=Wieseman|first=M.E.|title=Joseph Wright of Derby (English Derby 1734 – 1797) Dovedale by Moonlight, ca. 1784–85|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/Wright.htm|work=Modern Landscapes|publisher=Allen Memorial Art Gallert|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college obtained it in 1951. There is a matching painting to this which is a similar view but in daylight. That painting is still in Derbyshire at [[Parwich Hall]] which is in a small village close to Dovedale.
Wright also did a daylight view of Dovedale in 1787 which he gave to the industrialist [[Josiah Wedgwood]] out of respect for his patronage on the arts. This painting is now in the [[Wedgwood Museum]].&lt;ref name=jw&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Wright (1734–97)|url=http://www.wedgwoodmuseum.org.uk/learning/discovery_packs/pack/pack/2436/chapter/2780|publisher=The Wedgwood Museum|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two other paintings of Dovedale were sold to [[Sir Brooke Boothby, 6th Baronet|Sir Brooke Boothby bt.]] of [[Ashbourne Hall]], who had helped Wright when he put on the first one-man exhibition in London.&lt;ref name="liver"&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/featuredartists/josephwrightderby/ Joseph Wright of Derby], Liverpool Museums, accessed 25 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Boothby also purchased two views of nearby Matlock, two paintings of bridges in Rome as well as an unusual 1781 portrait of himself lying by a brook holding a book by [[Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Benedict|title=Joseph Wright of Derby: painter of light, Volume 1|year=1968|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ms09AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=alchemist+wright+joseph#v=onepage&amp;q=alchemist%20wright%20joseph&amp;f=false|page=127|isbn=978-0-7100-6284-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bronze Age}}
The '''Dunaverney Flesh-Hook''' is a sophisticated [[prehistoric]] [[bronze]] artefact from [[Prehistoric Ireland]], thought to be an item of ceremonial feasting gear, and a symbol of authority. It is believed it was used to remove chunks of meat from a stew in a large cauldron for serving. It dates to the [[Late Bronze Age]], between 1050 and 900 BC.  Since 1856, it has been in the [[British Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=831082&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=+Dunaverney+&amp;page=1 British Museum Collections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
Along the top of the [[flesh-hook]] are five birds, two large ones next to three smaller ones. At the bottom of the shaft, facing the family of five, are two birds. The group of two birds, presumably an adult pair, can be identified as [[corvid]]s, perhaps [[raven]]s, the family of five as [[swan]]s and [[Cygnet (bird)|cygnet]]s. The two sets of birds seem to invoke opposites: birds of water versus birds of the air; white ranged against black, [[fecundity]] as opposed to death (implied by the predatory character of ravens). Perhaps, in the mind of the Bronze Age inhabitants, the two sets of birds denoted a [[fable]] of opposites between good and bad. The flesh-hook was originally linked by pieces of [[oak]] shaft, only one fragment of which remains extant.

==Discovery==
The Dunaverney Flesh-Hook was discovered in 1829 by workmen who were cutting [[Peat|turf]] at Dunaverney Bog to the north of [[Ballymoney]], Co. Antrim, [[Northern Ireland]]. At the time of its discovery, the Dunaverney Flesh-Hook was unparalleled and for a long time many experts could not agree on its age and function. However, as more examples were found, not only in [[Ireland]] and Britain, but along the [[Atlantic]] seaboard of the European continent,  it became clear from their style, technology and context that they belonged to the [[Bronze Age]] and were clearly important instruments used during ceremonial [[feasts]]. To this day, the representation of [[birds]] seen on the Dunaverney Flesh-Hook remains unique in north-west Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''El gesticulador''''' ('''''The Impostor''''') is a 1938 play by [[Mexico|Mexican]] dramatist [[Rodolfo Usigli]].

==Plot==
The protagonist, César Rubio, is an unemployed professor who, in the aftermath of the [[Mexican Revolution]], settles with his family in a small town in the north of Mexico. There, a professor from [[Harvard University]] confuses him for a missing revolutionary hero with the same name. Rubio claims to be the deceased hero, telling the professor that, disillusioned with the course of the Revolution, he had embraced anonymity until thirty years thereafter. The story is published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', and Rubio comes to the attention of his compatriots, receiving accolades and fielding offers to run for the governorship of his state against a corrupt Revolutionary general. Rubio loses himself in his new identity, viewing it as an opportunity to renew the promise of the Revolution.
Things go awry when the corrupt general against whom César is running forces a meeting between the two. In their conversation, each attempts to blackmail the other. Navarro, the corrupt general, knows that César is not the general he claims to be. César, on the other hand, figures out that Navarro killed general César Rubio during the war. Outside the door was César's son, who had trouble reconciling his father's newly revealed heroism. Despite Navarro's threats, César proceeds with his candidacy for governor. After leaving to attend the election, Miguel, Julia, and Elena (César's son, daughter, and wife, respectively) discuss the nature of their father's actions; Julia supports him, while Miguel, and ultimately Elena are unable to come to terms with his lie. However, Elena also realizes that Navarro will try to kill César, and sends Miguel to warn his father of the assassination. Unfortunately, he arrives too late; both César and the assassin have been killed, leaving no link back to Navarro. Navarro briefly returns to the house to gloat before addressing the crowd outside, promising that César will be treated as a hero and his family will be taken care of. While the crowd is initially hesitant, Navarro's apparent goodwill convinces them, and they cheer both him and César.

==Controversy==
The play was daring for its time in that it used the true language of contemporary politics, a first for [[Mexican literature]].&lt;ref name="Krauze"&gt;Krauze, 526&lt;/ref&gt; Originally published in the literary review ''El hijo pródigo'' in 1938, the play was not staged until 1947. Its debut in the [[Mexico City]]'s [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] was welcomed by the theater-going public, but was met with hostility by the [[Mexican government]]. At issue was the play's declaration of the death of the Mexican Revolution in its institutionalization in the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]].&lt;ref&gt;Beardsell, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government cancelled several performances, and writers were hired to severely criticize the performances that were allowed to go on. The work thus became the only play in Mexican history to be [[censorship|censored]] by the government.

''Euphiction'' is a writing genre where writers do literary "[[cover versions]]" of specific songs, a marriage of musical inspiration with the written word, or a story that works like a three-minute single. The word combines euphonious and [[fiction]].

To write a euphictional story, writers select a song and either use the song's title or a lyric from the song as the title of the story, and then write a story that reflects the song itself. The goal of the piece is to create a literary cover of the song, by emulating the song's message or theme, or simply replicating the mood of the song in the story. The song's influence can be overt or cryptic, or the song can simply be recognized as a kind of soundtrack to the story. Some euphictional writers challenge themselves further by inserting as many of the lyrics from the song into the story. It must be stressed, however, that permission to use lyrics from the musician or band is paramount, especially if seriously considering the publication of the story.

Euphiction is a form of [[flash fiction]], where the maximum word count for the story is 1,000 words, not including the title. The imposed word limit helps to reflect the ephemeral nature of a song.

Euphiction, as a writing genre, fits neatly into [[Warren Ellis]]' concept of burst culture. Euphictional pieces, like the songs that inspire them, are meant to be digested quickly and provide readers with satisfying narratives in bursts. And like music, collected euphiction can be shuffled (read in any order) and encourages repeat readings.

==History==
The term euphiction was originally used in ''Cover Stories: A Euphictional Anthology'', where ten writers each chose different albums and wrote ten stories based on the songs from the selected album. The book collected 100 euphictional stories inspired by the music of [[Combichrist]], the [[Walkmen]], By Hook or Crook, the [[Twilight Singers]] and others. The writers included in the anthology were Simon Neil, Derrek Carriveau, Christian A. Dumais (''Empty Rooms Lonely Countries''), T.P. Whited, Erik Schmidt, Suzi M. (''Nemesis''), A.C. Noia, Derek Handley (''Introduction to the Japanese Language: Nihongo Ganbaroo''), Matt Gamble and N. Pendleton (''What Trees Have Done''). An introduction was written by ''Freddie &amp; Me'' creator [[Mike Dawson (cartoonist)|Mike Dawson]] and an afterword by [[Florida Atlantic University]] Associate Director of Bands, Dr. Sean Murray. The anthology was collected and edited by Dumais.

In February 2010, N. Pendleton's [http://nfpendleton.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/mcast-v3-episode-3-six-euphictions-featuring-the-music-of-nest/ Museioncast Volume 3, Episode 3: "Six Euphictions"], which featured the music of Nest from their self-titled EP, was made available online. Pendleton imposed further restrictions to these euphictional pieces, such as no story could be longer than 500 words, no rewrites, and all six stories had to be recorded for the podcast in one take.

The first officially published euphictional piece was in issue 2 of [[Shock Totem Magazine]], "Leave Me the Way I was Found," written by Christian A. Dumais.

[[Image:Comstock 1832 title page.jpg|thumb|Heavy foxing on the title page of an 1832 textbook]]

'''Foxing''' is an age-related process of deterioration that causes spots and browning on old paper [[document]]s such as [[book]]s, [[postage stamp]]s and [[wikt:certificate|certificate]]s. The name may derive from the [[red fox|fox]]-like reddish-brown color of the stains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/w/index.php?title=Foxing_(PCC)|title=Foxing (PCC) - Wiki|website=www.conservation-wiki.com|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the rust chemical [[ferric oxide]] which may be involved.  Paper so affected is said to be "foxed".

Although unsightly and a negative factor in the value of the paper item for collectors, foxing does not affect the actual integrity of the paper.

Foxing also occurs in biological study skins or specimens, as an effect of chemical reactions or [[mold]] on [[melanin]].

Aside from foxing, other types of age-related paper deterioration include destruction of the [[lignin]] by sunlight and absorbed atmospheric pollution, typically causing the paper to go brown and crumble at the edges, and acid-related damage to cheap paper such as [[newsprint]], which is manufactured without neutralizing acidic contaminants.

== Causes of foxing ==
The causes of foxing are not well understood. One theory is that foxing is caused by a [[fungal]] growth on the [[paper]]. Another theory is that foxing is caused by the effect on certain [[paper]]s of the [[oxidation]] of [[iron]], [[copper]], or other substances in the [[Wood pulp|pulp]] or [[Cloth|rag]] from which the paper was made. It is possible that multiple factors are involved. High humidity may contribute to foxing.

== Repairing foxed documents ==

Foxed documents can be repaired, with greater or lesser success, using [[sodium borohydride]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.bookstellyouwhy.com/bid/230209/how-to-prevent-and-reverse-foxing-in-rare-books|title=How to Prevent and Reverse Foxing in Rare Books|first=Kristin|last=Masters|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or proprietary bleaches, dilute [[hydrogen peroxide]] or lasers. Each method risks side effects or damage to the paper or ink. 

Another method is to scan the image and process that image using a high-level [[image processing]] program. This can usually remove the effects of foxing while leaving text and images intact.

== In biological specimens ==
It is generally not advisable to repair study specimens, except perhaps for mechanical damage. [[Type specimen]]s should – if at all possible – not be altered in any way. If foxing affects the study value of a specimen (e.g. in [[bird]] or [[mammal]] skins or in [[insects]], where it might affect diagnostic coloration), this might rather be remarked on the specimen label. Color standards{{sfn|Smithe|1974}} can provide a means of documenting coloration before or in the early stages of foxing.

The '''Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra''' ('''GSO'''; {{lang-sv|Göteborgs Symfoniker}}) is a Swedish [[symphony orchestra]] based in [[Gothenburg]].  The GSO is resident at the [[Gothenburg Concert Hall]] at [[Götaplatsen]].  The orchestra received the title of the '''National Orchestra of Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|Sveriges Nationalorkester}}) in 1997. 

The GSO was founded in 1905, with Heinrich Hammer as its first principal conductor.  The composer [[Wilhelm Stenhammar]] was the orchestra's second principal conductor, from 1907 to 1922.  In addition to Stenhammar conducting his own works, [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Carl Nielsen]] made regular guest-conducting appearances with the GSO.  The orchestra's fortunes waxed and waned in subsequent years, until the advent of [[Neeme Järvi]] as principal conductor, from 1982 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Tim Ashley | title=North stars | url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/jul/27/arts.highereducation | work=The Guardian | date=2001-07-27 | accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the GSO has a broad repertoire, it has a special affinity for the works of the Nordic Late Romantic composers, such as [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Edvard Grieg]].  During Järvi's tenure as principal conductor, the longest tenure of any principal conductor in the GSO's history, its reputation on the world stage was greatly increased, including sponsorships from [[Volvo]] and a recording contract with [[Deutsche Grammophon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Andrew Clements | title=Sibelius: The Symphonies, Gothenburg SO/ Jarvi(Deutsche Grammophon, four SACDs) | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/09/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 | work=The Guardian | date=2005-09-09 | accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Järvi currently holds the title of Principal Conductor Emeritus (''Chefdirigent Emeritus'') with the GSO.

[[Gustavo Dudamel]] was principal conductor of the GSO from 2007 to 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Reed Johnson | title=Conductor Gustavo Dudamel is riding a wave of Dudamania | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-et-dudamel23-2008nov23,0,1947651.story | work=Los Angeles Times | date=2008-11-23 | accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.gso.se/?pageid=8216 | title=Dudamel förnyar kontrakt med Göteborgs Symfoniker till 2012 | publisher=Göteborgs Symfoniker | date=30 September 2009 | accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now has the title of ''hedersdirigent'' (honorary conductor) of the GSO.  Past principal guest conductors of the GSO have included [[Christian Zacharias]].

'''Helmets for Peace''' is a work of art by [[Batuz]], consisting of military helmets and attached to them shields made of dyed paper pulp, straw and various other materials. The work of art aims to raise awareness among people about the important role of the peacekeeping missions of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr (2015). ''Helmets for Peace - Batuz: English''. Sandstein Verlag, Dresden. {{ISBN|978-3-95498-168-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Hans-Peter von Kirchbach]] (former General Inspector of the Bundeswehr) inspired Batuz to create a permanent installation from the helmets and the attached to them shields, which should turn into a symbol of peace to be followed by many armies around the world. In the summer of 2007 Batuz finished assembling the first installation of the work which was called “Helmets for Peace”. It was exhibited in an abandoned hall in [[Chemnitz]]. The work included 167 helmets and was 5,50 meter high and 11,30 meter wide.&lt;ref&gt;Batuz Foundation (2007). ''Helmets for Peace'' catalog&lt;/ref&gt;

The shields, which were used as vital parts of the artwork "Helmets for Peace", have been painted five years earlier by dozens of international artists in another project – the “border crossing” at the Neisse River at the border between Germany and Poland in 2002, in which the [[Bundeswehr]] played a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;Batuz Foundation &amp; Auswärtiges Amt der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (2003). ''no más fronteras''. Kloster Altzella/Nossen&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 “Helmets for Peace” was vandalized and a few weeks later disassembled and stored away.&lt;ref&gt;Mehlhorn, Th. "Star-Künstler packt ein", BILD, July 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the support of General Hans-Peter von Kirchbach and Minister [[Christian Schmidt (politician)|Christian Schmidt]] (at that time Parliamentary State Secretary in the German Federal Ministry of Defence) "Helmets for Peace" found a new home in the [[Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr]]. The exhibition opening took place on March 2, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Rieckmann, Adina. MDR Sachsenspiegel. March 4, 2015 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5ZJCO07X9Q&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Dr. [[Dieter Ronte]] acknowledges the importance of “Helmets for Peace”, drawing similarities to [[Picasso]]'s artwork [[Guernica]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronte, Dieter (2007). ''Batuz - Helmets for Peace'' http://societeimaginaire.net/prof-dr-dieter-ronte-batuz-helmets-for-peace/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Internet Symphony No. 1 - "Eroica"''', is a piece written by the Chinese composer [[Tan Dun]] for the [[YouTube Symphony Orchestra]]. It was the first of such events where musicians around the world play the same piece virtually via the internet, and the best performers selected were arranged into an internet symphony orchestra, featured on YouTube. In addition to submitting a performance of the Internet Symphony No.1 ("Eroica"), musicians were also allowed to submit a video of themselves playing one of the other selected pieces. The best performers were invited to play at New York City's [[Carnegie Hall]] on April 15, 2009, with all expenses paid by YouTube.  Winners were decided by the most number of votes cast by YouTube users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gbtimes.com/tan-duns-youtube-internet-symphony|title=Tan Dun's YouTube Internet Symphony|newspaper=gbtimes.com|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony was 4 minutes and 3 seconds long, the orchestra was commissioned by [[Google]]/[[YouTube]] and the work was published by [[G. Schirmer]] Inc.. It was performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] on October, 2008. Unconventionally, Tan Dun has included [[disc brakes]] and rims from automobiles as additional instruments. Tan also embedded a main theme from the first movement of [[Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|''Eroica'' Symphony]], into his work.

The [[Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra]], as a partner of the YouTube Symphony Orchestra Project, has created a Chinese orchestral version of Tan's Internet Symphony No.1, using the percussion instruments of the Beijing opera and ancient Chinese instruments like [[Bianzhong]] and [[guqin]]. It was rearranged by HKCO's Associate Conductor Chew Hee-Chiat, and conducted by Artistic Director and Principal Conductor Yan Huichang.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3987">The '''Kunstraum of Lüneburg University''' is an institution for contemporary art working across different faculties of [[Lüneburg University]]. Since its renaming in 2007 the complete name is '''Kunstraum of Leuphana University Lüneburg'''.

== History ==

In 1993 the Kunstraum has been founded by a interdisciplinary group of researchers, which is up to today in charge for the academic and artistic projects. Members of this group are:

* Art historian [[Beatrice von Bismarck]] (since 1999 at the [[Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig]])
* Mathematician Diethelm Stoller (retired since 2005)
* Sociologist Ulf Wuggenig (currently the acting director of Kunstraum)

The official opening in 1994 coincided with the project '''Services''', which has been organized in collaboration with the art historian Helmut Draxler, at this time director of [[Kunstverein Munich]], and the artist [[Andrea Fraser]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afterall.org/journal/issue.35/responding-to-the-relations-and-conditions-of-exhibitions_the_services_working-group-discussion-foru&lt;/ref&gt; The program of the subsequent years has been influenced and inspired by writings of [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Nelson Goodman]], [[Thomas S. Kuhn]], and, amongst others, [[Howard S. Becker]] and included collaborations with artists and theoreticians accociated with [[Institutional Critique]].

'''Lākhey''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: लाखे, lā-khé) (alternative spellings '''Lākhe''', '''Lākhay''', लाखय्) is a demon in Nepalese folklore. He is depicted with a ferocious face, protruding fangs and mane of red or black hair. Lakhes figure prominently in traditional [[Newar]] culture of [[Nepal Mandala]]. The Lakhe tradition is found in the [[Kathmandu Valley]] and other Newar settlements throughout [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Gurung| first = Anuj | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/nepal/demon-among-deities| title = A Demon Among Deities| work = Cultural Survival| publisher = | date=Spring 2009| accessdate = 23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakhes are said to be demons who used to live in the forests and later became protectors to the townspeople.&lt;ref&gt;Trussler, Simon and Barker, Clive (1 September 2003). ''New Theatre Quarterly 74, Volume 19.'' Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521535891}}, 9780521535892. Page 127.&lt;/ref&gt; A female Lakhe is known as Lasin (लसिं).

The other common legendary being in Nepalese folklore is the [[Khyah (legendary creature)|Khyāh]], who is depicted as a fat, hairy ape-like creature.

==Dancing Lakhes==

Lakhey Dance is one of the most popular dances of Nepal. Performers wearing a Lakhe costume and mask perform dances on the streets and city squares during festivals. The mask is made of [[papier-mâché]] and [[yak]] tails are used for the hair. The Lakhe dance is characterised by wild movements and thumping music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.sikkim-culture.gov.in/Dances/Trance%20Dances.aspx| title = Lakhey Mask Dance| work = | publisher = Cultural Affairs and Heritage Department, Government of Sikkim| date=| accessdate = 24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous Lakhe is [[Majipa Lakhey]] of [[Kathmandu]] who appears during the [[Yenya]] (Indra Jatra) festival in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Toffin| first = Gérard | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/64459961/Indra-Jatra-of-Kathmandu-Gerard-Toffin| title = The Indra Jātrā of Kathmandu as a Royal Festival Past and Present| work = Contributions to Nepalese Studies| publisher = Center for Nepal and Asian Studies, Tribhuvan University| date=January 1992| accessdate = 24 July 2012}} Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koizumi, Fumio (1983). ''Dance and music in South Asian drama: Chhau, Mahākālī pyākhan and Yakshagāna.'' Academia Music. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He is worshipped as a deity. City dwellers offer food and ritual items to him as he moves through the city accompanied by his musical band giving dance performances.

The Lakhe stops at major crossroads and market squares to give a performance. During the dance, a small boy is known as Jhyalincha (झ्यालिंचा) taunts the Lakhe making him chase him in anger. Jhyalincha always manages to slip into the crowd and escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bajracharya |first=Chunda |editor-first=Subash Ram |editor-last=Prajapati |title=The Masked Dances of Nepal Mandal|publisher=Thimi: Madhyapur Art Council|date=2006|chapter=Majipa Lakhe|isbn=99946-707-0-0}} Page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunla Lakhe comes out during [[Gunla]], the 10th month in the [[Nepal Sambat]] calendar which corresponds to August.

==Other Lakhes==

There are other Lakhes with particular characteristics. These mythical beings are said to reside in various parts of the city.

* Michyāh Lākhe (मिच्या: लाखे) (meaning "fire burning demon" in [[Nepal Bhasa]]) is a spirit who is said to cause a fire by [[spontaneous combustion]] wherever it resides. People possessed by Michyāh Lakhe are also believed to cause a fire. 
* Minpu Lākhe (मिंपू लाखे) also causes a fire.

The '''Michael Howard Studios''' is an acting studio for the [[performing arts]] located in at 152 West 25th Street in [[Chelsea, Manhattan]], New York City; the studio was founded in 1953 by actor/director [[Michael Howard (American actor)|Michael Howard]].

==History==
A protégé of both [[Sanford Meisner]] at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] and [[Lee Strasberg]] at the [[Actors Studio]], Howard established his Studio in 1953 grounded in the work of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]. Over the years, the studio incorporated many schools of thought and techniques from around the world.

The Studio attributes its existence to the [[Group Theatre (New York City)|Group Theatre]]. In 1931, [[Harold Clurman]], [[Cheryl Crawford]], and Strasberg founded the Group Theatre in New York, beginning a watershed period in American Theater. The Group Theatre brought together [[Elia Kazan]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Sanford Meisner]], [[Frances Farmer]], [[Clifford Odets]], [[Irwin Shaw]], and [[John Garfield]] (among many others). Their creative commune introduced America to the revolutionary teachings of Stanislavski, and it set in motion new schools of thought that would dominate acting for the rest of the century. The Group Theatre closed its doors in 1941, and its visionary members set out in new directions.

In 1942, Howard joined the Neighborhood Playhouse as a scholarship student under Sanford Meisner. Howard vigorously pursued his studies and absorbed everything Meisner had to impart. Howard then served in World War II as a parachutist, and upon returning, joined Equity in 1947. Strasberg invited Howard to study with him, and soon he was asked to become a member of the Actors Studio. Howard began a long career of hundreds of roles on stage and screen, including Odets' ''[[The Country Girl (1950 play)|The Country Girl]]'' on Broadway and the film ''[[The Men (film)|The Men]]'' with Marlon Brando. Acting led to directing and, in 1952, to teaching, when [[Sidney Lumet]] asked Howard to replace him at the [[High School of Performing Arts]]. The next year, in 1953, a group of actors asked Howard to lead their sessions, and Michael Howard Studios was born.

Over the next five decades, Howard's teachings expanded to the Yale School of Drama, the [[Juilliard School]], the American Conservatory Theatre, and Boston University while continuing his master classes at the Michael Howard Studios.

The studio is now in its 55th year in continuous operation making it the longest running private acting studio in New York. In honor of the 55th anniversary of the studio, the studio received an official proclamation from Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], declaring May 4, 2009, Michael Howard Studios Day "in honor of the studio's contribution to New York's rich theatrical history".{{Cite quote|date=November 2017}}

"Mughal Architecture" is the type of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] developed by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries throughout the ever-changing extent of their empire in the [[Indian subcontinent]].  It developed the styles of earlier Muslim dynasties in India as an amalgam of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Iranian architecture|Persian]], Turkish and [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]]. Mughal buildings have a uniform pattern of structure and character, including large bulbous domes, slender minarets at the corners, massive halls, large vaulted gateways and delicate ornamentation. Examples of the style can be found in India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The Mughal dynasty was established after the victory of [[Babur]] at Panipat in 1526. During his five-year reign, Babur took considerable interest in erecting buildings, though few have survived. His grandson [[Akbar]] built widely, and the style developed vigorously during his reign. Among his accomplishments were [[Agra Fort]], the fort-city of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], and the [[Buland Darwaza]]. Akbar's son [[Jahangir]] commissioned the [[Shalimar Bagh, Srinagar|Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir]].

Mughal architecture reached its zenith during the reign of [[Shah Jahan]], who constructed the [[Taj Mahal]], the [[Jama Masjid (Delhi)|Jama Masjid]], the [[Red Fort]], and the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens in Lahore]]. The end of his reign corresponded with the decline of Mughal architecture and the Empire itself.

==Monuments==
===Agra Fort===
{{main article|Agra fort}}
Agra fort is a [[UNESCO]] world heritage site in [[Agra]], Uttar Pradesh. The major part of Agra fort was built by [[Akbar The Great]] during 1565 to 1574. The [[architecture]] of the fort clearly indicates the free adoption of the [[Rajput]] planning and construction. Some of the important buildings in the fort are Jahangiri Mahal built for Jahangir and his family, the Moti Masjid, and Mena Bazaars. The Jahangir Mahal is an impressive structure and has a courtyard surrounded by double-storeyed halls and rooms.

=== Humayun's Tomb===
{{main article|Humayun's Tomb}}
'''Humayun's tomb''' is the [[tomb]] of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]] in Delhi, India. The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress [[Bega Begum]] (also known as Haji Begum), in 1569-70, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad, Persian architects chosen by her. It was the first garden-tomb on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is often regarded as the first mature example of Mughal architecture.

===Fatehpur Sikri===
{{main article|Fatehpur Sikri}}
Akbar’s greatest architectural achievement was the construction of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], his capital city near Agra at a trade and Jain pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fatehpur Sikri was once a Jain pilgrimage centre: Book|date=2013-02-27|work=Zee News|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/excavation-at-akbars-fort-at-fatehpur-sikri-reveals-flourishing-jain-and-hindu-habitation/1/243578.html|title=Excavation at Akbars fort at Fatehpur Sikri reveals flourishing Jain and Hindu habitation|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/fatehpur-sikri-was-once-a-jain-pilgrimage-centre-book/story-4DfRoVJ6tVxmWzz1RztA5I.html|title=Fatehpur Sikri was once a Jain pilgrimage centre: Book|date=2013-02-27|work=hindustantimes.com/|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The construction of the walled city was started in 1569 and completed in 1574.

It contained some of the most beautiful buildings – both religious and secular which testify to the Emperor’s aim of achieving social, political and religious integration.  The main religious buildings were the huge Jama Masjid and small tomb of Salim Chisti.  The tomb, built in 1571 in the corner of the mosque compound, is a square marble chamber with a verandah. The cenotaph has an exquisitely designed lattice screen around it. Buland Darwaza, also known as the Gate of Magnificence, was built by Akbar in 1576 to commemorate his victory over Gujarat and the Deccan. It is 40 metres high and 50 metres from the ground. The total height of the structure is about 54 metres from ground level...

The Haramsara, the royal seraglio  in [[Fatehpur Sikri]] was an area where the royal women lived. The opening to the Haramsara is from the Khwabgah side separated by a row of cloiters. According to Abul Fazl, in [[Ain-i-Akbari]], the inside of Harem was guarded by senior and active women, outside the enclosure the [[eunuch]]s were placed, and at a proper distance there were faithful [[Rajput]] guards.&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta(2013), page 146, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hil", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jodha Bai's Palace====
This is the largest palace in the Fatehpur Sikri seraglio, connected to the minor ''haramsara'' (where the less important harem ladies and maids would have resided) quarters. The main entrance is double storied, projecting out of the [[facade]] to create a kind of [[porch]] leading into a recessed entrance with a balcony. Inside there is a quadrangle surrounded by rooms. The columns of rooms are ornamented with a variety of [[Hindu]] sculptural motifs. 
The glazed tiles on the roofs from [[Multan]] have an eye catching shade of [[turquoise]].&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta(2013), page151, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hil", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque was built in honour of [[Mariam-uz-Zamani#The misnomer of Jodhabai|Jodha Bai]], mother of Jahangir and wife of Akbar.  Her Mughal name was Mariyam Zamani Begum and this being the reason that the mosque was built in her honor in Lahore’s walled city. Jahangir built his mother Mariyam Zamani Begum’s mosque and is just 1&amp;nbsp;km away from the tomb of Akbar near Agra at a place called Sikandra.

Buland Darwaza dominates the landscape. Historian [[`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni]] writes that it was the highest gateway in Hindustan at that time until today.

====Inscription====

A [[chronogram]] is inscribed on the central archway composed by Ashraf Khan, one of Akbar's principal secretaries that reads,

{{Quote|In the reign of King of the world Akbar,
To whom is due the order in the country.
The Sheikh-ul-Islam adorned the mosque.
Which for its elegance deserves as much reverence as the Ka'ba.
The year of the completion of this magnificent edifice.
Is found in the words: duplicate of the Masjidi'l-Haram.&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta (2013), page 172-176, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hill", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
The Tomb of [[Sheikh Salim Chishti]] is famed as one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture in India, built during the years 1580 and 1581, along with the imperial complex at Situated near Zenana Rauza and facing south towards Buland Darwaza, within the quadrangle of the Jama Masjid which measures 350&amp;nbsp;ft. by 440&amp;nbsp;ft. It enshrines the burial place of the Sufi saint, Salim Chisti (1478 – 1572), a descendant of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, and lived in a cavern on the ridge at Sikri. The mausoleum, constructed by Akbar as a mark of his respect for the Sufi saint, who foretold the birth of his son, who was named Prince Salim after him and later succeeded Akbar to the throne of the Mughal Empire.

==Shah Jahan==
The [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in [[Lahore]] was commissioned during the reign of Shah Jahan, and is famous for its rich embellishment which covers almost every interior surface.
Rather than building a huge monuments like his predecessors to demonstrate their power, Shah Jahan built elegant monuments. The force and originality of this previous building style gave way under Shah Jahan to a delicate elegance and refinement of detail, illustrated in the palaces erected during his reign at [[Agra Fort|Agra]], [[Delhi Fort|Delhi]] and [[Lahore Fort|Lahore]]. Some examples include the [[Taj Mahal]] at Agra, the tomb of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. The [[Moti Masjid (Lahore Fort)|Moti Masjid]] (Pearl Mosque) in the [[Lahore Fort]] and the [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] at Delhi are imposing buildings of his era, and their position and architecture have been carefully considered so as to produce a pleasing effect and feeling of spacious elegance and well-balanced proportion of parts. Shah Jahan also built sections of the  [[Sheesh Mahal (Lahore)|Sheesh Mahal]], and [[Naulakha pavilion]], which are all enclosed in the fort. He also built a mosque named after himself in [[Thatta]] called [[Shahjahan Mosque]]. Shah Jahan also built the Red Fort in his new capital at Shah Jahanabad, now [[Delhi]]. The red sandstone Red Fort is noted for its special buildings-[[Diwan-i-Aam]] and [[Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort)|Diwan-i-Khas]]. Another mosque was built during his tenure in Lahore called Wazir Khan Mosque, by Shaikh Ilm-ud-din Ansari who was the court physician to the emperor.

===Taj Mahal===
{{main article|Taj Mahal}}

The Taj Mahal, a [[World Heritage Site]] described as the "[[teardrop on the cheek of time]]" by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], was built between 1630–49 by the emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.(Mumtaz died after her 14th delivery). Its construction took 22 years and required 22,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants. Built entirely of white marble at a cost of $1018200000, it is one of the [[New7Wonders of the World]]. The building's longest [[plane (geometry)|plane]] of [[symmetry]] runs through the entire complex except for the [[sarcophagus]] of Shah Jahan, which is placed off centre in the crypt room below the main floor. This symmetry is extended to the building of an entire mirror [[mosque]] in red sandstone, to complement the [[Mecca]]-facing mosque placed to the west of the main structure. Shah Jahan used "[[pietra dura]]", a method of decoration on a large scale-inlaid work of jewels.

===Wazir Khan Masjid===
{{main|Wazir Khan Mosque}}
[[File:Wazir_Khan_Mosque_by_Moiz.jpg|thumb|[[Wazir Khan Mosque]], A [[Mughal era]] mosque in [[Lahore]]]]

==Aurangzeb and later Mughal architecture==
{{further information|Bibi Ka Maqbara}}
In [[Aurangzeb]]'s reign (1658–1707) squared stone and marble was replaced by brick or rubble with [[stucco]] ornament. [[Srirangapatna]] and [[Lucknow]] have examples of later Indo-Mughal architecture. He made additions to the Lahore Fort and also built one of the thirteen gates which was later named after him (Alamgir).

===Badshahi Masjid===
{{main|Badshahi Mosque}}
The [[Badshahi Mosque|Badshahi Masjid]] in Lahore, Pakistan was commissioned by the sixth [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. Constructed between 1671 and 1673, it was the largest mosque in the world upon construction. It is the third largest mosque in Pakistan and the seventh largest mosque in the world. The mosque is adjacent to the Lahore Fort and is the last in the series of congregational mosques in red sandstone. The red sandstone of the walls contrasts with the white marble of the domes and the subtle intarsia decoration. Aurangzeb's mosque's architectural plan is similar to that of his father, Shah Jahan, the Jama Masjid in Delhi; though it is much larger. It also functions as an [[Idgah (place)|''idgah'']]. The courtyard which spreads over 276,000 square feet, can accommodate one hundred thousand worshippers; ten thousand can be accommodated inside the mosque. The [[minarets]] are {{convert|196|ft|m}} tall. The Mosque is one of the most famous Mughal structures, but suffered greatly under the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In 1993, the Government of Pakistan included the Badshahi Mosque in the tentative list for [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name=whc.unesco.org&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1277/ |title=Badshahi Mosque, Lahore &amp;ndash; UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional monuments===
Additional monuments from this period are associated with women from Aurangzeb's imperial family. The construction of the elegant [[Zinat al-Masjid]] in [[Daryaganj]] was overseen by Aurangzeb's second daughter [[Zinat-al-Nissa]]. Aurangzeb's sister [[Roshan-Ara]] who died in 1671. The tomb of [[Roshanara Begum]] and the garden surrounding it were neglected for a long time and are now in an advanced state of decay. [[Bibi Ka Maqbara]]  was a mausoleum built by Prince [[Azam Shah]], son of Emperor Aurangzeb, in the late 17th century as a loving tribute to his mother, Dilras Bano Begam in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Maharashtra]]. The [[Alamgiri Gate]], built in 1673, is the main entrance to the Lahore Fort in present-day Lahore. It was constructed to face west towards the Badshahi Mosque in the days of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.

Another construction of the Mughal era is [[Lalbagh Fort]] (also known as "Fort Aurangabad"), a Mughal palace fortress at the Buriganga River in the southwestern part of Dhaka, Bangladesh, whose construction started in 1678 during the reign of Aurangzeb.

==Mughal gardens==
{{main article|Mughal garden}}
[[File:Faiz Baksh (Bestower of Goodness) terrace view from Farah Baksh (Bestower of Pleasure) terrace.jpg|thumb|The [[Shalimar Gardens, Lahore]] are among the most famous Mughal gardens.]]
Mughal gardens are gardens built by the Mughals in the Islamic style of architecture. This style was influenced by Persian gardens and Timurid gardens. Significant use of rectilinear layouts are made within the walled enclosures. Some of the typical features include pools, fountains and canals inside the gardens. The famous gardens are the [[Char Bagh]] gardens at Taj Mahal, gardens at Humayun's Tomb Shalimar Gardens of Lahore, Delhi and Kashmir as well as [[Pinjore]] Garden in [[Haryana]].

==Mughal bridges==
[[Shahi Bridge, Jaunpur]] was constructed during the reign of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]].

{{Mythology}}
'''Myth''' is a [[folklore genre]] consisting of narratives that play a fundamental role in society, such as foundational tales.  The main characters in myths are usually [[gods]], [[demigod]]s or [[supernatural]] humans.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"&gt;"myths", ''A Dictionary of English Folklore''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = oflaherty&gt;{{cite book|last =Doniger O'Flaherty|first = Wendy|quote =I think it can be well argued as a matter of principle that, just as 'biography is about chaps', so mythology is about gods.|page = 19|title = Hindu Myths|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Af7TFlN5hmsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date =1975|publisher = Penguin|isbn = 9780140443066}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myths are often endorsed by rulers and priests and are closely linked to [[religion]] or spirituality.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}} In fact, many societies group their myths, legends and history together, considering myths to be true accounts of their remote past.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"/&gt;{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 23}}{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1984|p= 102}} [[Creation myth]]s particularly, take place in a primordial age when the world had not achieved its later form.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}{{sfn|Dundes|1984|p= 1}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 6}} Other myths explain how a society's [[norm (social)|customs]], [[institution]]s and [[taboo]]s were established and sanctified.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 6}} There is a complex relationship between [[myth and ritual|recital of myths and enactment of rituals]].

The study of myth began in [[ancient history]]. Rival classes of the [[Greek myths]] by [[Euhemerus]], [[Plato]] and [[Sallustius]] were developed by the [[Neoplatonists]] and later revived by [[Renaissance]] mythographers. Today, the study of myth continues in a wide variety of academic fields, including [[folklore studies]], [[philology]], and [[psychology]]. The term '''mythology''' may either refer to the study of myths in general, or a body of myths regarding a particular subject. The academic comparisons of bodies of myth is known as [[comparative mythology]].

===''Myth''===
Definitions of ''myth'' to some extent vary by scholar. Finnish [[folklore studies|folklorist]] Lauri Honko offers a widely cited definition:
{{quote|Myth, a story of the gods, a religious account of the [[cosmogony|beginning of the world]], the [[creation myth|creation]], fundamental events, the exemplary deeds of the gods as a result of which the world, nature and culture were created together with all parts thereof and given their order, which still obtains. A myth expresses and confirms society's religious values and norms, it provides a pattern of behavior to be imitated, testifies to the efficacy of [[ritual]] with its practical ends and establishes the sanctity of [[cult]].&lt;REF NAME="HONKO-1984"&gt;{{cite book|last =Honko|first = Lauri|date = 1984 |chapter =The Problem of Defining Myth|editorlink=Alan Dundes|editor-first = Alan|editor-last = Dundes|title =Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth|page = 49|publisher = [[University of California Press]]|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l5Om2ALAFbEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholars in other fields use the term ''myth'' in varied ways.{{sfn|Dundes|1984|p=147}}{{sfn|Doty|2004|pp= 11–12}}{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 5}} In a broad sense, the word can refer to any [[traditional story]],{{sfn|Kirk|1984|p=57}}{{sfn|Kirk|1973|p= 74}}{{sfn|Apollodorus|1976|p= 3}} [[popular misconception]] or [[imagination|imaginary]] entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Merriam-Webster]]'s Collegiate Dictionary|chapter=myth|page=770|edition=10th|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]], Inc|location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]]|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while myth and other folklore genres may overlap, myth is often thought to differ from genres such as [[legend]] and [[Folklore genre|folktale]] in that neither are considered to be sacred narratives.&lt;ref name="SALAMON-GOLDBERG-2012"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qhsdhM9tI3EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last1 =Salamon|first1=  Hagar |first2= Harvey E.|last2= Goldberg|date = 2012|chapter =Myth-Ritual-Symbol|editor1-first= Regina F.|editor1-last= Bendix |editor2-first= Galit|editor2-last= Hasan-Rokem |title = A Companion to Folklore|page = 125|publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 7}} Some kinds of folktales, such as [[fairy stories]], are not considered true by anyone, and may be seen as distinct from myths for this reason.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9, 17}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 10–11}}{{sfn|Pettazzoni|1984|pp= 99–101}} Main characters in myths are usually [[gods]], [[demigod]]s or [[supernatural]] humans,{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}}&lt;ref name="mythfolk"&gt;"myths", ''A Dictionary of English Folklore''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oflaherty" /&gt; while legends generally feature humans as their main characters.{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 9}} However, many exceptions or combinations exist, as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Aeneid]]''.{{sfn|Kirk|1973|pp=22, 32}}{{sfn|Kirk|1984|p= 55}} Moreover, as stories spread between cultures or as faiths change, myths can come to be considered folktales, their divine characters recast as either as humans or demihumans such as [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], [[elf|elves]] and [[faerie]]s.&lt;ref name="mythfolk"/&gt;{{sfn|Doty|2004|p=114}}{{sfn|Bascom|1965|p= 13}} Conversely, historical and literary material may acquire mythological qualities over time.

In colloquial use, the word ''myth'' can also be used of a collectively held belief that has no basis in fact, or any false story.&lt;ref&gt;"myth, n., §2" OED Online, Oxford University Press, June 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/124670.

(2012) ''Anthropology and Religion: What We Know, Think, and Question'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the term ''myth'' is widely used to imply that a story is not [[objective truth|objectively true]], the identification of a narrative as a myth can be highly political: many adherents of religions view their religion's stories as [[truth|true]] and therefore object to the stories being characterised as myths. Nevertheless, scholars now routinely speak of [[Christian mythology]], [[Jewish mythology]], [[Islamic mythology]], [[Hindu mythology]], and so forth. Traditionally, Western scholarship, with its Judaeo-Christian heritage, has viewed narratives in the [[Abrahamic religions]] as being the province of [[theology]] rather than mythology; meanwhile, identifying religious stories of colonised cultures, such as stories in [[Hinduism]], as myths enabled Western scholars to imply that they were of lower truth-value than the stories of [[Christianity]]. Labelling all religious narratives as ''myths'' can be thought of as treating different traditions with parity.&lt;ref name=leeming=preface&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|title=Preface|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQFtlva3HaYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR7|page=vii|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2005|author=David Leeming}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklorist [[Alan Dundes]] defines myth as a [[sacred]] [[narrative]] that explains how the world and humanity evolved into their present form. Dundes classified a sacred narrative as "a story that serves to define the fundamental worldview of a culture by explaining aspects of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society".&lt;ref name=grassie/&gt; Anthropologist [[Bruce Lincoln]] defines ''myth'' as "ideology in narrative form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lincoln |first= Bruce |year= 2006 |title= An Early Moment in the Discourse of "Terrorism": Reflections on a Tale from Marco Polo |jstor= 3879351 |journal= [[Comparative Studies in Society and History]] |volume= 48 |issue= 2 |pages= 242–259 |quote= More precisely, mythic discourse deals in master categories that have multiple referents: levels of the cosmos, terrestrial geographies, plant and animal species, logical categories, and the like.

===''Mythography''===
The compilation or description of myths is sometimes known as ''mythography'', a term which can also be used of a scholarly anthology of myths (or, confusingly, of the study of myths generally).&lt;ref&gt;"mythography, n." ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, July 2018, https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124691.

===''Mythos''===
Because ''myth'' is sometimes used in a pejorative sense, some scholars have opted to use the term ''mythos'' instead.&lt;ref name=grassie&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grassie |first1=William |date=March 1998 |title=Science as Epic?

"Conscious generation" of mythology was termed ''mythopoeia'' by, amongst others, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/235084 mythopoeia, n.]" ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, July 2018.

==Origins of the terms ''myth'' and ''mythology''==
[[File:Francesco Hayez 028.jpg|thumb|''Odysseus Overcome by Demodocus' Song'', by Francesco Hayez, 1813–15]]
The word ''myth'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] ''μῦθος'' [''mȳthos''], meaning 'speech, narrative, fiction, myth, plot'. In Anglicised form, this Greek word began to be used in English (and was likewise adapted into other European languages) in the early nineteenth century, in a much narrower sense, as a scholarly term for 'a traditional story, typically involving supernatural beings or forces, which embodies and provides an explanation, aetiology, or justification for something such as the early history of a society, a religious belief or ritual, or a natural phenomenon'.&lt;ref name =mythmythos&gt;"[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124670 myth, n.]", "[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124705 mythos, n.]" ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, July 2018. Accessed 12 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|μυθολογία}} [''mythología''] ("story," "lore," "legends," "the telling of stories") combines the word ''mȳthos'' with the suffix -''λογία'' [''-logia''] ("study"), and meant 'romance, fiction, story-telling'.&lt;ref name="oedlogy"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', {{nowrap|1st ed.}} "-logy, ''comb. form''". Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, [[Plato]] used ''mythología'' as a general term for "fiction" or "story-telling" of any kind.

The Greek term ''mythología'' was then borrowed into [[Latin language|Latin]]. [[Late Latin]] ''mythologia'', which occurs in the title of Latin author [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius|Fulgentius]]' fifth-century ''Mythologiæ'', denoted the explication of Greek and Roman stories about their gods, which we now call [[classical mythology]]. Fulgentius's ''Mythologiæ'' explicitly treated its subject matter as [[allegory|allegories]] requiring interpretation and not as true events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Fabius Planciades |last=Fulgentius|title=Fulgentius the Mythographer|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=73mJIuYfmzEC}}|year=1971|publisher=Ohio State University Press|isbn=978-0-8142-0162-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin term was then adopted in [[Middle French]] as ''mythologie''. Whether from French or Latin usage, English adopted the word "mythology" in the fifteenth century, at first in the sense 'the exposition of a myth or myths; the interpretation of fables; a book of such expositions'. The word is first attested in [[John Lydgate]]'s ''[[Troy Book]]'' of c. 1425.&lt;ref name=oedmlogy&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd ed.

''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

From Lydgate until the seventeenth or eighteenth-century, ''mythology'' was used to mean a [[moral]], [[fable]], [[allegory]] or a [[parable]], or collection of traditional stories,&lt;ref name="oedmlogy" /&gt;{{refn|All which [''sc.''

Thus the word ''mythology'' entered the English language before the word "myth"; [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]]'s ''[[Johnson's Dictionary|Dictionary]]'', for example, has an entry for ''mythology'', but not for ''myth''. {{refn|[[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]]'s ''[[Johnson's Dictionary|Dictionary]]'', for example, has entries for mythology,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Samuel.

===Meanings in Ancient Greece===
The term μῦθος (''mythos'') appears in the works of [[Homer]] and other poets of Homer's era.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson (2004), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In these works, the term had several meanings: conversation, narrative, speech, story, tale, and word.

Like the related term λόγος (''[[logos]]''), ''mythos'' expresses whatever can be delivered in the form of words; these can be contrasted with  ἔργον (''ergon''), a Greek term for action, deed, and work.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; The term ''mythos'' lacks an explicit distinction between true or false narratives.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;

In the context of the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], the term ''mythos'' referred to the myth, the narrative, the plot, and the story of a play.&lt;ref name="Wiles"&gt;Wiles (2000), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Wiles, the Greek term ''mythos'' in this era covered an entire spectrum of different meanings, from undeniable falsehoods to stories with religious and symbolic significance.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt;

According to philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE), the spirit of a theatrical play was its ''mythos''.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; The term ''mythos'' was also used for the source material of [[Greek tragedy]]. The tragedians of the era could draw inspiration from [[Greek mythology]], a body of "traditional storylines" which concerned [[Deity|gods]] and [[hero]]es.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; David Wiles observes that modern conceptions about Greek tragedy can be misleading. It is commonly thought that the ancient audience members were already familiar with the ''mythos'' behind a play, and could predict the outcome of the play. However, the Greek dramatists were not expected to faithfully reproduce traditional myths when [[Theatrical adaptation|adapting them for the stage]]. They were instead recreating the myths and producing new versions.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt; Storytellers like [[Euripides]] (c. 480–406 BCE) relied on [[suspense]] to excite their audiences. In one of his works, [[Merope (Messenia)|Merope]] attempts to kill her son's murderer with an axe, unaware that the man in question is actually her son. According to an ancient description of audience reactions to this work, the audience members were genuinely unsure of whether she would commit [[filicide]] or she will be stopped in time. They rose to their feet in terror and caused an uproar.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt;

David Wiles points that the traditional ''mythos'' of Ancient Greece, was primarily a part of its [[oral tradition]]. The [[Greeks]] of this era were a literate culture, but produced no [[Religious text|sacred texts]]. There were no definitive or authoritative versions of myths recorded in texts and preserved forever in an unchanging form.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"&gt;Wiles (2000), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Instead multiple variants of myths were in circulation. These variants were adapted into songs, dances, poetry, and visual art. Performers of myths could freely reshape their source material for a new work, adapting it to the needs of a new audience or in response to a new situation.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"/&gt;

Children in Ancient Greece were familiar with traditional myths from an early age. According to the philosopher [[Plato]] (c. 428–347 BCE), mothers and [[nursemaid]]s narrated myths and stories to the children in their charge: David Wiles describes them as a repository of mythological lore.&lt;ref name="Wiles2"/&gt;

[[Bruce Lincoln]] has called attention to the apparent meaning of the terms ''mythos'' and ''logos'' in the works of [[Hesiod]]. In ''[[Theogony]]'', Hesiod attributes to the [[Muse]]s the ability to both proclaim truths and narrate plausible falsehoods (falsehoods which seem like real things).&lt;ref name="Lincoln"&gt;Lincoln (1999), pp. 3–5&lt;/ref&gt; The verb used for narrating the falsehoods in the text is ''legein'', which is etymologically associated with ''logos''. There are two variants in the manuscript tradition for the verb used to proclaim truths. One variant uses ''gerusasthai'', the other ''mythesasthai''. The latter is a form of the verb ''mytheomai'' (to speak, to tell), which is etymologically associated with ''mythos''.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; In the ''[[Works and Days]]'', Hesiod describes his dispute with his brother Perses. He also announces to his readers his intention to tell true things to his brother. The verb he uses for telling the truth is ''mythesaimen'', another form of ''mytheomai''.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt;

Lincoln draws the conclusion that Hesiod associated the "speech of ''mythos''" (as Lincoln calls it) with telling the [[truth]]. While he associated the "speech of ''logos''" with telling [[lie]]s, and hiding one's true thoughts (dissimulation).&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; This conclusion is strengthened by the use of the plural term ''logoi'' (the plural form of ''logos'') elsewhere in Hesiod's works. Three times the term is associated with the term "[[seduction|seductive]]" and three times with the term "falsehoods".&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt; In his genealogy of the gods, Hesiod lists ''logoi'' among the children of [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess personifying strife. Eris' children are ominous figures, which personify various physical and verbal forms of conflict.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt;

==Interpreting myths==

===Comparative mythology===
{{Main article|Comparative mythology}}
Comparative mythology is the systematic comparison of myths from different cultures. It seeks to discover underlying themes that are common to the myths of multiple cultures. In some cases, comparative mythologists use the similarities between separate mythologies to argue that those mythologies have a common source. This source may inspire myths or provide a common "protomythology" that diverged into the mythologies of each culture.{{sfn|Littleton|1973|p=32}}

===Functionalism===
A number of commentators have argued that myths function to form and shape society and social behaviour. [[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]] argued that one of the foremost functions of myth is to establish models for behavior{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 8}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 51}} and that myths may provide a religious experience. By telling or reenacting myths, members of traditional societies detach themselves from the present, returning to the mythical age, thereby coming closer to the divine.{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 23}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 51}}{{sfn|Eliade|1998|p= 19}}

[[Lauri Honko|Honko]] asserted that, in some cases, a society reenacts a myth in an attempt to reproduce the conditions of the mythical age. For example, it might reenact the healing performed by a god at the beginning of time in order to heal someone in the present.&lt;REF NAME="HONKO-1984"/&gt; Similarly, [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]] argued that modern culture explores religious experience. Since it is not the job of science to define human morality, a religious experience is an attempt to connect with a perceived moral past, which is in contrast with the technological present.{{sfn|Barthes|1972}}

[[Devdutt Pattanaik|Pattanaik]] defines mythology as "a subjective truth of people that is communicated through stories, symbols and rituals". He adds, "unlike fantasy that is nobody’s truth, and history that seeks to be everybody’s truth, mythology is somebody’s truth."&lt;ref name="PD2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/culture/why-i-insist-on-calling-myself-a-mythologist|title=Why I Insist On Calling Myself A Mythologist|last=Pattanaik|first=Devdutt|date=14 September 2015|website=Swarajya|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euhemerism===
{{Main article|Euhemerism}}
{{See also|Herodotus}}
One theory claims that myths are distorted accounts of historical events.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} According to this theory, storytellers repeatedly elaborate upon historical accounts until the figures in those accounts gain the status of gods.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}}{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} For example, the myth of the wind-god [[Aeolus]] may have evolved from a historical account of a king who taught his people to use sails and interpret the winds.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 194}} [[Herodotus]] (fifth-century BCE) and [[Prodicus]] made claims of this kind.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} This theory is named ''[[euhemerism]]'' after mythologist [[Euhemerus]] (c. 320 BCE), who suggested that Greek gods developed from legends about human beings.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}}&lt;ref&gt;"Euhemerism", ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegory===
Some theories propose that myths began as allegories for natural phenomena: [[Apollo]] represents the sun, [[Poseidon]] represents water, and so on.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} According to another theory, myths began as allegories for philosophical or spiritual concepts: [[Athena]] represents wise judgment, [[Aphrodite]] desire, and so on.{{sfn|Honko|1984|p= 45}} [[Max Müller|Müller]] supported an allegorical theory of myth. He believed myths began as allegorical descriptions of nature and gradually came to be interpreted literally. For example, a poetic description of the sea as "raging" was eventually taken literally and the sea was then thought of as a raging god.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 20}}

===Personification===
{{See also|Mythopoeic thought}}
Some thinkers claimed that myths result from the [[Anthropomorphism|personification]] of objects and forces. According to these thinkers, the ancients worshiped natural phenomena, such as fire and air, gradually deifying them.{{sfn|Bulfinch|2004|p= 195}} For example, according to this theory, ancients tended to view things as gods, not as mere objects.{{sfn|Frankfort|Frankfort|Wilson|Jacobsen|2013|p= 4}} Thus, they described natural events as acts of personal gods, giving rise to myths.{{sfn|Frankfort|Frankfort|Wilson|Jacobsen|2013|p= 15}}

===Myth-ritual theory===
{{See also|Myth and ritual}}
According to the myth-ritual theory, myth is tied to ritual.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 61}} In its most extreme form, this theory claims myths arose to explain rituals.{{sfn|Graf|1996|p= 40}} This claim was first put forward by [[William Robertson Smith|Smith]],{{sfn|Meletinsky|2014| pp=19–20}} who argued that people begin performing rituals for reasons not related to myth. Forgetting the original reason for a ritual, they account for it by inventing a myth and claiming the ritual commemorates the events described in that myth.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 63}} [[James Frazer|Frazer]] claimed that humans started out with a belief in magical rituals; later, they began to lose faith in magic and invented myths about gods, reinterpreting their rituals as religious rituals intended to appease the gods.{{sfn|Frazer|1913|p= 711}}

==History of the academic discipline==
Historically, important approaches to the study of mythology have included those of [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Schiller]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], [[Freud]], [[Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Lévi-Strauss]], [[Northrop Frye|Frye]], the Soviet school, and the [[Myth and Ritual School]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Lanoue, Foreword to Meletinsky, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
[[File:Myths and legends of Babylonia and Assyria (1916) (14801987593).jpg|thumb|right|''Myths and legends of [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]]'' (1916)]]
The critical interpretation of myth began with the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Presocratics]].{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 1}} Euhemerus was one of the most important pre-modern mythologists. He interpreted myths as accounts of actual historical events – distorted over many retellings. Sallustius&lt;ref&gt;On the Gods and the World, ch. 5, See Collected Writings on the Gods and the World, The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; divided myths into five categories – theological, physical (or concerning natural laws), animistic (or concerning soul), material, and mixed. Mixed concerns myths that show the interaction between two or more of the previous categories and are particularly used in initiations.

Plato famously condemned poetic myth when discussing education in the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]].'' His critique was primarily on the grounds that the uneducated might take the stories of gods and heroes literally. Nevertheless, he constantly referred to myths throughout his writings. As [[Platonism]] developed in the phases commonly called [[Middle Platonism]] and [[neoplatonism]], writers such as [[Plutarch]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Proclus]], [[Olympiodorus the younger|Olympiodorus,]] and [[Damascius]] wrote explicitly about the symbolic interpretation of traditional and Orphic myths.&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps the most extended passage of philosophic interpretation of myth is to be found in the fifth and sixth essays of Proclus’ ''Commentary on the Republic'' (to be found in ''The Works of Plato I'', trans. Thomas Taylor, The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1996); Porphyry’s analysis of the Homeric Cave of the Nymphs is another important work in this area (''Select Works of Porphyry'', Thomas Taylor The Prometheus Trust, Frome, 1994). See the external links below for a full English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mythological themes were consciously employed in literature, beginning with [[Homer]]. The resulting work may expressly refer to a mythological background without itself becoming part of a body of myths ([[Cupid and Psyche]]). Medieval romance in particular plays with this process of turning myth into literature. ''Euhemerism'', as stated earlier, refers to the rationalization of myths, putting themes formerly imbued with mythological qualities into pragmatic contexts. An example of this would be following a cultural or religious paradigm shift (notably the re-interpretation of [[Paganism|pagan]] mythology following [[Christianization]]).

===European Renaissance===
[[File:Bartolomeo di Giovanni - The Myth of Io - Walters 37421.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=The ancient Roman poet Ovid, in his "The Metamorphoses," told the story of the nymph Io who was seduced by Jupiter, the king of the gods. When his wife Juno became jealous, Jupiter transformed Io into a heifer to protect her. This panel relates the second half of the story. In the upper left, Jupiter emerges from clouds to order Mercury to rescue Io. In the lower left, Mercury guides his herd to the spot where Io is guarded by the hundred-eyed Argus. In the upper center, Mercury, disguised as a shepherd, lulls Argus to sleep and beheads him. Juno then takes Argus's eyes to ornament the tail feathers of her peacock and sends the Furies to pursue Io, who flees to the Nile River. At last, Jupiter prevails on his wife to cease tormenting the nymph, who, upon resuming her natural form, escapes to the forest and ultimately becomes the Egyptian goddess Isis|This panel by [[Bartolomeo di Giovanni]] relates the second half of the [[Metamorphoses]].

Interest in polytheistic mythology revived during the [[Renaissance]], with early works of mythography appearing in the sixteenth century, among them the ''[[Theologia mythologica|Theologia Mythologica]]'' (1532).

===Nineteenth century===
The first modern, Western scholarly theories of myth appeared during the second half of the nineteenth century{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 1}} — at the same time as the word ''myth'' was adopted as a scholarly term in European languages.&lt;ref name="mythmythos" /&gt; They were driven partly by a new interest in Europe's ancient past and [[vernacular]] culture, associated with [[Romantic Nationalism]] and epitomised by the research of [[Jacob Grimm]] (1785–1863). This movement drew European scholars' attention not only to Classical myths, but also material now associated with [[Norse mythology]], [[Finnish mythology]], and so forth. Western theories were also partly driven by Europeans' efforts to comprehend and control the cultures, stories and religions they were encountering through [[colonialism]]. These encounters included both extremely old texts such as the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''[[Rigveda]]'' and the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', and current oral narratives such as [[mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]] or stories told in [[traditional African religions]].&lt;ref name = shippey&gt;Tom Shippey, 'A Revolution Reconsidered: Mythography and Mythology in the Nineteenth Century', in ''The Shadow-Walkers: Jacob Grimm’s Mythology of the Monstrous'', ed. by Tom Shippey, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 291/Arizona Studies in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, 14 (Tempe, AZ: Arizon Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005), pp. 1–28 (esp. pp. 4–13).&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectual context for nineteenth-century scholars was profoundly shaped by emerging ideas about [[evolution]]. These ideas included the recognition that many Eurasian languages—and therefore, conceivably, stories—were all descended from a lost common ancestor (the [[Indo-European language]]) which could rationally be reconstructed through the comparison of its descendant languages. They also included the idea that [[Cultural evolution|cultures might evolve]] in ways comparable to species.&lt;ref name = shippey/&gt; In general, nineteenth-century theories framed myth as a failed or obsolete mode of thought, often by interpreting myth as the primitive counterpart of modern science within a [[Unilineal evolution|unilineal]] framework that imagined that human cultures are travelling, at different speeds, along a linear path of cultural development.{{sfn|Segal|2015|pp= 3–4}}

One of the dominant mythological theories of the later nineteenth century was "nature mythology", whose foremost exponents included [[Max Müller]] and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]. This theory posited that "primitive man" was primarily concerned with the natural world. It tended to interpret myths that seemed distasteful European Victorians—for example tales about sex, incest, or cannibalism—as being metaphors for natural phenomena like agricultural fertility.&lt;ref&gt;John McKinnell, ''Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend'' (Cambridge: Brewer, 2005), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to conceive impersonal natural laws, early humans tried to explain natural phenomena by attributing souls to inanimate objects, giving rise to [[animism]]. According to Tylor, human thought evolved through stages, starting with mythological ideas and gradually progressing to scientific ideas.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 4}} Müller also saw myth arising from language, even calling myth a "disease of language". He speculated that myths arose due to the lack of abstract nouns and neuter gender in ancient languages. Anthropomorphic figures of speech, necessary in such languages, were eventually taken literally, leading to the idea that natural phenomena were in actuality conscious beings or gods.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 20}} Not all scholars, not even all nineteenth-century scholars, accepted this view. [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] claimed "the primitive mentality is a condition of the human mind, and not a stage in its historical development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mâche|title=Music, Myth and Nature, or The Dolphins of Arion| year=1992| page= 8 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YNCVOY423HsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first = Francois-Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship, noting the fundamental lack of evidence for "nature mythology" interpretations among people who actually circulated myths, has likewise abandoned the key ideas of "nature mythology".&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Dorson, 'The Eclipse of Solar Mythology', in ''Myth: A Symposium'', ed. by Thomas A. Sebeok (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1955), 25–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John McKinnell, ''Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend'' (Cambridge: Brewer, 2005), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James George Frazer]] saw myths as a misinterpretation of magical rituals, which were themselves based on a mistaken idea of natural law: this idea was central to the "[[myth and ritual]]" school of thought.{{sfn|Segal|2015|pp= 67–68}} According to Frazer, humans begin with an unfounded belief in impersonal magical laws. When they realize applications of these laws do not work, they give up their belief in natural law in favor of a belief in personal gods controlling nature, thus giving rise to religious myths. Meanwhile, humans continue practicing formerly magical rituals through force of habit, reinterpreting them as reenactments of mythical events. Finally humans come to realize nature follows natural laws, and they discover their true nature through science. Here again, science makes myth obsolete as humans progress "from magic through religion to science."{{sfn|Frazer|1913|p= 711}}

Segal asserted that by pitting mythical thought against modern scientific thought, such theories imply modern humans must abandon myth.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 3}}

===Twentieth century===
[[File:Prometheus by Gustave Moreau.jpg|thumb|''[[Prometheus]]'' (1868) by [[Gustave Moreau]]. In the mythos of [[Hesiodus]] and possibly [[Aeschylus]] (the [[Greek mythos|Greek]] trilogy ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Aeschylus)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' and ''[[Prometheus Pyrphoros]]''), Prometheus is bound and tortured for giving fire to humanity]]

The earlier twentieth century saw major work developing [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] approaches to interpreting myth, led by [[Sigmund Freud]], who, drawing inspiration from Classical myth, began developing the concept of the [[Oedipus complex]] in his 1899 ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''. [[Carl Jung|Jung]] likwise tried to understand the psychology behind world myths. Jung asserted that all humans share certain innate unconscious psychological forces, which he called ''[[archetypes]]''. He believed similarities between the myths of different cultures reveals the existence of these universal archetypes.&lt;ref&gt;Boeree.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-twentieth century saw the influential development of a [[structuralist theory of mythology]], led by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]. Strauss argued that myths reflect patterns in the mind and interpreted those patterns more as fixed mental structures, specifically pairs of opposites (good/evil, compassionate/callous), rather than unconscious feelings or urges.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 113}} Meanwhile, [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] developed analyses of myths focusing on their social functions in the real world. He is associated with the idea that myths such as [[Origin myth|origin stories]] might provide a "mythic charter"—a legitimisation—for cultural norms and social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Birenbaum, ''Myth and Mind'' (Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1988), pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, following the Structuralist Era (roughly the 1960s to 1980s), the predominant anthropological and sociological approaches to myth increasingly treated myth as a form of narrative that can be studied, interpreted and analyzed like ideology, history and culture. In other words, myth is a form of understanding and telling stories that is connected to power, political structures, and political and economic interests. These approaches contrast with approaches such as those of Campbell and Eliade that hold that myth has some type of essential connection to ultimate sacred meanings that transcend cultural specifics. In particular, myth was studied in relation to history from diverse social sciences. Most of these studies share the assumption that history and myth are not distinct in the sense that history is factual, real, accurate, and truth, while myth is the opposite.

In the 1950s, Barthes published a series of essays examining modern myths and the process of their creation in his book ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', which stood as an early work in the emerging [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] approach to mythology, which recognised myths' existence in the modern world and in [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wsGDVdYoRA4C&amp;dq=Barthes+Mythologies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKp_nv8q_cAhWlF5oKHSWQB6oQ6AEIJDAA|title = Mythologies|date = 1972|publisher = Hill and Wang|last = Barthes|first = Roland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The twentieth century saw rapid [[secularisation]] in Western culture. This made Western scholars more willing to analyse narratives in the [[Abrahamic religions]] as myths; theologians such as [[Rudolf Bultmann]] argued that a modern Christianity needed to [[Demythologization|demythologize]];&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Bultmann, ''Jesus Christ and Mythology'' (New York: Scribner, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; and other religious scholars embraced the idea that the mythical status of Abrahamic narratives was a legitimate feature of their importance.{{sfn|Segal|2015|p= 3}} This, in his appendix to ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', and in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', [[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]] attributed modern humans’ anxieties to their rejection of myths and the sense of the sacred.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} The Christian theologian [[Conrad Hyers]] wrote that
{{quote|...myth today has come to have negative connotations which are the complete opposite of its meaning in a religious context... In a religious context, however, myths are storied vehicles of supreme truth, the most basic and important truths of all. By them people regulate and interpret their lives and find worth and purpose in their existence. Myths put one in touch with sacred realities, the fundamental sources of being, power, and truth. They are seen not only as being the opposite of error but also as being clearly distinguishable from stories told for entertainment and from the workaday, domestic, practical language of a people. They provide answers to the mysteries of being and becoming, mysteries which, as mysteries, are hidden, yet mysteries which are revealed through story and ritual. Myths deal not only with truth but with ultimate truth.{{sfn|Hyers|1984|p=107}}}}

===Twenty-first century===
Both in nineteenth-century research that tended to see existing records of stories and folklore as imperfect fragments of partially lost myths, and in twentieth-century structuralist work that sought to identify underlying patterns and structures in often diverse versions of a given myth, there had been a tendency to synthesise sources to attempt to reconstruct what scholars supposed to be more perfect or underlying forms of myths. From the late twentieth century, however, researchers influenced by [[postmodernism]] tended instead to argue that each account of a given myth has its own cultural significance and meaning, and argued that rather than representing degradation from a once more perfect form, myths are inherently plastic and variable.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. John McKinnell, ''Both One and Many: Essays on Change and Variety in Late Norse Heathenism'', Philologia: saggi, ricerche, edizioni a cura bi Teresa Pàroli, 1 (Rome, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; There is, consequently, no such thing as the 'original version' or 'original form' of a myth. One prominent example of this movement was [[A.K. Ramanujan]]'s essay ''[[Three Hundred Ramayanas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A.K. Ramanujan, ‘Three Hundred Rāmāyaṇas: Five Examples and Three Thoughts on Translation’, in ''[http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft3j49n8h7/ Many Rāmāyaṇas: The Diversity of a Narrative Tradition in South Asia]'', ed. by Paula Richman (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), pp. 22–48; [http://www.trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/three-hundred-Ramayanas-A-K-Ramanujan.pdf reprinted] in A.K. Ramanujan, ''The Collected Essays of A.K. Ramanujan'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 131–60, {{ISBN|9780195668964}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondingly, scholars challenged the precedence that had once been given to texts as a medium for mythology, arguing that other media, such as the visual arts or even landscape and place-naming, could be as or more important.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ken Dowden, ''The Uses of Greek Mythology'' (London: Routledge, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern mythology==
[[File:10,000 Belgian francs of 1929 edited.jpg|thumb|left|1929 [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[banknote]], depicting [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and [[caduceus]]]]
In modern society, myth is often regarded as a collection of stories. Scholars in the field of [[cultural studies]] research how myth has worked itself into modern discourses. Mythological discourse can reach greater audiences than ever before via digital media. Various mythic elements appear in [[television]], [[Film|cinema]] and [[video game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/library/nctefiles/resources/journals/ej/1026-jul2013/ej1026exploring.pdf|title=Exploring the Boundaries of Narrative: Video Games in the English Classroom|last=Ostenson|first=Jonathan|date=2013|website=www2.ncte.org/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although myth was traditionally transmitted through the oral tradition on a small scale, the film industry has enabled filmmakers to transmit myths to large audiences via film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cinematic Mythmaking: Philosophy in Film|last=Singer|first=Irving|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] psychology myths are the expression of a culture or society’s goals, fears, ambitions and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Indick|first=William|date=November 18, 2004|title=Classical Heroes in Modern Movies: Mythological Patterns of the Superhero|url=|journal=Journal of Media Psychology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of modern visual storytelling is rooted in the mythological tradition. Many contemporary films rely on ancient myths to construct narratives. [[The Walt Disney Company]] is well-known among cultural study scholars for "reinventing" traditional childhood myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Folklore Studies and Popular Film and Television: A Necessary Critical Survey|last=Koven|first=Michael|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=176–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many films are not as obvious as Disney fairy tales, the plots of many films are based on the rough structure of myths. Mythological archetypes, such as the cautionary tale regarding the abuse of technology, battles between gods and creation stories, are often the subject of major film productions. These films are often created under the guise of [[cyberpunk]] [[action film]]s, [[fantasy]], [[drama]]s and [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] tales.{{sfn|Corner|1999|pp=47–59}}

21st-century films such as ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', ''[[Immortals (2011 film)|Immortals]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' continue the trend of mining traditional mythology to frame modern plots. Authors use mythology as a basis for their books, such as [[Rick Riordan]], whose [[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians|Percy Jackson and the Olympians]] series is situated in a modern-day world where the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek deities]] are manifest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/percy-jackson-problem|title=The Percy Jackson Problem|last=Mead|first=Rebecca|date=2014-10-22|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-11-06|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Papenbroek Collection''' is one of the largest 18th-century Dutch art collections.&lt;ref&gt;Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of its owner, [[Gerard van Papenbroek]] (1673&amp;ndash;1743), the antiquities were bequeathed to [[Leiden University]]. These antiquities would become the earliest collection of the Dutch [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden|National Museum of Antiquities]], and have been called a "decisive factor for the creation of the first academic chair of archaeology".&lt;ref&gt;Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The portraits and manuscripts were divided between Leiden University and the [[Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;M. van Roon, 'Getuigenissen van Geleerde mannen en Braave dichteren, de verzameling van de Amsterdamse koopman-verzamelaar Gerardus van Papenbroeck (1673-1743)', ''Jaarboek Amstelodamum'' 84 (1992), p. 41-60&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Gerard van Papenbroek was a member of the city elite in [[Amsterdam]], had been an [[alderman]] and became a [[burgomaster]] of the city in 1723. He began collecting art, a common pastime for the elite of the period. Instead of traveling to the Mediterranean he used his fortune to buy antiquities from other collectors at auctions. In this way Papenbroek gathered a part of the [[Reynst Collection]] and pieces from many other famous and lesser known collectors, including some Roman antiquities that had belonged to the Flemish painter [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]].&lt;ref&gt;Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 14-5&lt;/ref&gt;

During his life Papenbroek put the collection on display in his townhouse, his country house and in the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]] in Amsterdam. He attempted to have the collection published, but this would not be done until after his death.

When Papenbroek died in October 1743 his will stipulated that his collection of antiquities should go to Leiden University and was to be put on public display.&lt;ref&gt;Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The university thus gained about 150 pieces, which were welcomed with an official academic session after they had been arranged for public viewing. In 1746 a professor from Leiden published an illustrated catalogue of the collection, but after that little attention was paid to the antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 17-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden|National Museum of Antiquities]] would be founded in the early 19th century, and the world's first professor of [[archaeology]], [[Caspar Reuvens]], would transform the 'archaeological cabinet' into a real museum.

His collections of portraits and manuscripts were divided between Leiden University and the Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam. Amsterdam also received the painting ''View on the ruins of Palmyra'', the oldest known depiction of the legendary desert city of [[Palmyra]], in modern-day Syria, painted by [[G. Hofstede]] in 1693.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5391">{{about|the theory of literary forms and discourse|the treatise by Aristotle|Poetics (Aristotle)|other uses}}
'''Poetics''' is the theory of literary forms and literary [[discourse]]. It may refer specifically to the theory of [[poetry]], although some speakers use the term so broadly as to denote the concept of "theory" itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gérard Genette]] (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CWjjasIjWiYC&amp;pg=PA14 ''Essays In Aesthetics, Volume 4''], p.14: {{quotation|My program then was named "Theory of Literary Forms" — a title that I supposed to be less ambiguous for minds a little distant from this specialty, if it is one, than its (for me) synonym Poetics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "poetics" comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ποιητικός ''poietikos'' "pertaining to poetry," literally "creative, productive," from ποιητός ''poietos'' "made," verbal adjective of ποιεῖν ''poiein'' "to make."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=poetic "poetic"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar T.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;F. Brogan identifies&lt;ref name="Brogan"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brogan | first = T. | title = The New Princeton Handbook of Poetic Terms | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-691-03672-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; three major movements in Western poetics over the past 3,000 years, beginning with the [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]], [[Metaphysical objectivism|objectivist]] [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian tradition]] (see ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''). During the [[romanticism|romantic era]], poetics tended toward [[expressionism]] and emphasized the perceiving [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]. The 20th century witnessed a return to the Aristotelian paradigm, followed by trends toward metacriticality, or the establishment of a theory of poetics.

Eastern poetics developed primarily with reference to the [[lyric poetry|lyric]], as opposed to the [[mimesis|mimetic]].&lt;ref name="Brogan" /&gt;

==In literary criticism==

Poetics is distinguished from [[hermeneutics]] by its focus not on the meaning of a text, but rather its understanding of how a text's different elements come together and produce certain effects on the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Culler |first1=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Culler |year=1997 |title=Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction}}:&lt;/ref&gt; Most literary criticism combines poetics and hermeneutics in a single analysis; however, one or the other may predominate given the text and the aims of the one doing the reading.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9143">The [[Pyxis (vessel)|pyxis]] made in 968 CE/357AH for Prince al-Mughira (15&amp;nbsp;cm x 8&amp;nbsp;cm) is a portable ivory carved container that dates from Medieval Islam's [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Spanish Umayyad period]]. It is in the collection of the [[Louvre]] in Paris. The container was made in one of the [[Medina Azahara|Madinat al-Zahra]] workshops, near modern-day [[Cordoba, Spain]] and is thought to have been a coming-of-age present for the son of caliph Abd al-Rahman III. Historical sources say that the prince referred to as al-Mughira was Abu al-Mutarrif al-Mughira, the last born son of the caliph [[Abd-ar-Rahman III|‘Abd al-Rahman III]], born to a concubine named Mushtaq.&lt;ref&gt;Makariou, “The al-Mughira Pyxis,” 316&lt;/ref&gt;  We are certain this pyxis belongs to al-Mughira because of the inscription around the base of the lid which reads: “Blessing from God, goodwill, happiness and prosperity to al-Mughīra, son of the Commander of the Faithful, may God's mercy [be upon him], made in the year 357"

[[File:Pyxid Al Mughira OA 4068.jpg|thumb|Pyxis of al-Mughira. 968 CE/357AH. 15cm x 8cm]]

==Physicality and Context==
Pixides are known as luxury personal vessels given to members of the royal family and are thought to have been used for holding precious gems, jewelry, aromas, perfume etc.; however, the actual purpose of the pyxis of al-Mughira is unknown because there are no traces of any substance on the interior. Though the entire surface of the pyxis is intricately and expertly carved with different forms of decoration, most attention lies within the four main medallions around its diameter.

The exterior of the pyxis is elaborately carved and incised elephant ivory, imported by the caliph from North Africa. It is possible the pyxis was originally inlaid with gold and silver but only traces of jade remain. Though discovered with metal hinges mounting the lid on the container, it is believed (and clear) that the mounts were placed later than the original creation date because no space was allowed for the metal mounts to be placed. This is known because the hinges destroy part of the inscription.&lt;ref&gt;Rosser-Owen, “The Metal Mounts,” 303&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to these mentioned uncertainties, it is unclear how the lid was intended to be situated on the vessel and thus unknown how the inscription should be read, what is considered front or back and what its relation is to the scenes below.&lt;ref&gt;Makariou, “The al-Mughira Pyxis,” 325&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Medallions==
'''Medallion One''' displays a scene of two men gathering eggs from falcon nests, which is popularly seen as a symbol for Umayyad power or legitimacy. Scholars have claimed that the synchronism between the falcon and Umayyad power was a current and strong symbol due to such metaphors found in poetry and art during that time period. In particular, [[Abd al-Rahman I|‘Abd al-Rahman I al-Dakhil]], founder of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyads]] in al-Andalus, was famously named “the falcon of the Quraysh” by an [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph.&lt;ref&gt;Makariou, “The al-Mughira Pyxis,” 321&lt;/ref&gt;
Because both men are being bitten by dogs it is also suggested that this was an implication of threat to those who would try to grasp power.

'''Medallion Two''' is of two horse riders picking clusters of dates from a date-palm tree. These trees are primarily found in the Middle East and North Africa and may allude to the Eastern lands, or “homeland of the palm tree groves”, lost to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]]—another sect of control within Medieval Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Prado-Vilar, “Enclosed in Ivory,” 147&lt;/ref&gt;  Abd al-Rahman I, who founded Umayyad rule in the Iberian Peninsula, used the tree as code in his poetry. Some scholars suggest that the intertwining branches of the tree represent the twin branches of the Umayyad dynasty of which “both prophecy and the caliphate sprang” according to Umayyad panegyrist Hasan al-Tubni.&lt;ref&gt;Makariou, “The al-Mughira Pyxis,” 320&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medallion Three''' shows a musical court scene of two seated figures flanking a middle figure who is suspected to be a servant due to his smaller, secondary scale. One figure holds the braided specter and flask of the Umayyads, while the other holds a fan. The meaning of this medallion is quite controversial but a popular viewpoint argues that the man with the specter and flask symbolizes the Umayyad Caliph and the figure with the fan symbolizes the Abassids. It is argued by Francisco Prado-Vilar that this scene could represent a ceremony performed in the court of al-Hakam II that would be of political significance to al-Mughira and act as a reminder to him of the continuation and solidity of the dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Prado-Vilar, “Enclosed in Ivory,” 141&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medallion Four''' is the only medallion that shows a common symbol of power through an image of a bull and lion fighting. Some scholars, including those at the Louvre and Eva Baer, have interpreted this as a message of authority and legitimacy of Umayyad Caliphs in competition with the Abbasid Caliphs, who ruled in Baghdad. Prado-Vilar ties this scene to fables told at the time that were used to teach life lessons to the young, especially to family of the royal court. He makes the claim that, with keeping Kalila wa Dimna in mind, al-Mughira would reflect on the symbolism of the “tragic consequences of listening to evil advice of those plotting to have him conspire against his brother’s lineage;” a way for the caliph to keep him in his secondary role and to not attempt to seek reign.&lt;ref&gt;Prado-Vilar, “Enclosed in Ivory,” 145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation Controversy==
Scholars like Renata Holod argue that the pyxis was a present given to al-Mughira with an ironic, comical edge as a reminder to him that he would never be the next in line for rule. Holod also suspects the gift was not from the caliph or commissioned by al-Mughira; however, scholars like Makariou who refute this claim argue that it would be difficult for someone other than royalty to commission such a highly expensive item and to solely focus to a purely ironic message does not lead anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Makariou, “The al-Mughira Pyxis,” 318&lt;/ref&gt;  Makariou’s arguments also conflict with Prado-Vilar, who focuses solely on the pyxis as a vessel of serious warning to al-Mughira in regards to any political goals he may have had; however, Makariou contends that this argument shows lack of knowledge in regards to medieval caliphate customs and that it was not in the nature of the caliph to be so seriously concerned with internal power struggles.

The actual purpose of the pyxis of al-Mughira is highly argued and unanimously unknown. We do know the caliphate of Cordoba was infamous for their ability to acquire highly expensive and luxurious materials for their royal court. And because of their power, capabilities and secrecy, they maintained a singular and exclusive relationship with Northern Africa; a trading agreement no other dynasty was able to access. Ivory, a valuable and hard to work with material, was one of the many ways they displayed their wealth and power; however, using these capabilities to create the pyxis of al-Mughira is widely seen as wasteful and mediocre because of its leisurely context indicated by the assortment of princely entertainments on its exterior; however it is a vessel of impeccable craftsmanship and expert design.
To date the pyxis of al-Mughira’s purpose is still speculated and debated.
It is currently a part of the Islamic Art collection at the [[Louvre]] in Paris.

'''Robert Watts''' was an American artist best known for his work as a member of the international group of artists [[Fluxus]]. Born in [[Burlington, Iowa]] June 14, 1923,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/bio.html] Robert Watts on Fluxus Artpool&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artist_e.jsp?iartistid=5816 Cybermuse]&lt;/ref&gt; he became Professor of Art at Douglass College, [[Rutgers University]], New Jersey in 1953, a post he kept until 1984. In the 1950s, he was in close contact with other teachers at Rutgers including [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Geoffrey Hendricks]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. This has led some critics to claim that [[pop art]] and [[conceptual art]] began at Rutgers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mgsa.rutgers.edu/runy/runy03_nfc.html Sid Sachs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/acatalog/__Off_Limits_257.html Corinne Robins]&lt;/ref&gt;

He organised the proto-fluxus ''Yam Festival'', May 1963 with [[George Brecht]], and was one of the main protagonists, along with [[George Maciunas]], in turning [[SoHo]], New York, into an artist's quarter. He died Friday September 2, 1988 of lung cancer in [[Martins Creek, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/04/obituaries/robert-watts-artist-and-fluxus-figure-dies-of-cancer-at-65.html New York Times Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also known as '''Bob Watts''' or '''Doctor Bob'''.

==Early life==
[[Image:WattsBlackEggs.jpg|200px|left|thumb|''Black Eggs'', 1964, a piece included at the ''American Supermarket'' exhibition at New York's Bianchini Gallery. This piece is now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington]]
After earning a degree in [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Louisville]], Watts served as an officer in the United States Navy aboard aircraft carriers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/Friedman_e.html Flux Med Dr Bob]&lt;/ref&gt; Watts left the Navy and moved to New York in 1948, where he studied art at the [[Art Students League]] and later at [[Columbia University]] from where he gained a degree in the History of Art, majoring in pre-Columbian and non-Western Art.&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;  After becoming Professor of Art at Douglass College, Rutgers University, 1953, he started to exhibit works in a proto-pop style. He participated in Pop Art shows such as ''New Forms, New Media'' exhibition in 1960 at Martha Jackson's Gallery; the ''Popular Image'' exhibition at the Washington Gallery of Art in 1963; and the 1964 ''American Supermarket'' exhibition at New York's Bianchini Gallery, which also featured [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]].&lt;ref name="MailArt"&gt;[http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html Mail Art John Held Jr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405050332/http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html |date=April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After exhibiting at [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli's]] Gallery in 1964, Watts turned his back on the gallery system, and concentrated instead on the [[anti-art]] of the emerging New York avant-garde centred around George Maciunas. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[His] work obviously related to that of the Pop artists that I had discovered a few years before...Watts' chromed objects closely related to [[Jasper Johns|Johns']] cast beer cans and flashlights, for instance. The 1964 exhibition also included Watts' sculpture of plaster cast loaves of bread on shelves. That work, in particular, I think of as one of his most important inventions. I'm also particularly fond of the chrome eggs and egg carton in my own collection which will appear in this [posthumous] show. The public will be surprised that an artist -so promising at such an early date- did not receive through the years the appreciation he deserved." Leo Castelli&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Yam Festival===
[[Image:LanternEvent.jpg|240px|right|thumb|''Lantern Event; an aspect of Yam Festival'', 1962, a mail art piece by Robert Watts and George Brecht; the coloured paper scores are by Watts.]]
Watts met the artist and chemist [[George Brecht]] in 1957 after the latter saw an exhibition of Watts' work and sought his acquaintance;&lt;ref&gt;George Brecht; A Heterospective, Konig, 2005, p306&lt;/ref&gt; the two would meet for lunch every week, with Kaprow occasionally joining them, for a number of years to discuss art and to plan joint exhibitions. One of the most famous was the proto-fluxus ''Yam Festival'' (1962–3), which used mail-art to build expectations for a month-long series of happenings, performances and exhibitions at Rutgers, New York City and [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal's]] farm in [[New Jersey]]. Participating artists included [[Alison Knowles]], [[Ay-O]], [[Al Hansen]], [[Ray Johnson]], [[John Cage]], and [[Dick Higgins]]. The events ran parallel to George Maciunas' Fluxus Festivals in Europe (Sept 1962-early 1963) -which had already performed some of Watts' event scores in Düsseldorf- and the two events were officially joined when Maciunas published Brecht's event scores as [[Water Yam (artist's multiple)|''Water Yam'']], the first of the Flux boxes to be published. Watts' own flux collection, ''Robert Watts Events'' was published a year later and brought together many of the mail art event scores that had been used to publicise the Yam Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/Miller_h.html Flux Med]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I consider Yam Lecture a chain of events arranged in such a way that the sequence is quite random, no performance exactly like any other, with changing performers, costumers, actions, sounds, words, images, and so on. The 'structure' is such that it is very flexible (nearly non-existent) and permits inclusion of anything one wished to do and any possible future changes. It is a loose and open thing. The audience puts it together the way it wishes or not at all."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Similar ideas were at work in Yam Festival which George Brecht and I carried out last year. In effect this was a mailing to an audience, sometimes randomly chosen, of an assortment of things. Some were event cards similar to the above; others were objects, food, pencils, soap, photos, actions, words, facts, statements, declarations, puzzles, etc. Certain ones were by subscription. One might say this way of working is a way or manner of calling attention to what one wishes to talk about; or it is a way of talking about it. Or it is a way to hold up for scrutiny a range of material that ordinarily is not so directly useful for art or has not yet been so considered." Robert Watts, quoted in the Times Literary Supplement, 1964&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One example of Watts' event scores around this point is ''Casual Event'';

===''Casual Event'' (1962)===
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;drive car to filling station&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;inflate right front tire&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;continue to inflate until tire blows out&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;change tire*&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;drive home

&lt;span style="color:#EEEEEE;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;*if car is newer model drive home on blown out tire

According to [[Henry Flynt]], Maciunas '[begged] Watts not to continue 'Yam' separately from Fluxus. Maciunas was desperate to unite the whole post-Cage movement under his command.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html Mailart; Robert Watts by John Held Jr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405050332/http://www.mailartist.com/johnheldjr/RobertWatts.html |date=April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluxus===

Watts' friendship with Maciunas was cemented when the latter was confined to a hospital bed throughout May 1963. To cheer him up, Watts sent him ''Hospital Events'' (see [http://printedmatter.org/catalogue/moreinfo.cfm?title_id=3931&amp;return=/search/search.cfm&amp;qty=0&amp;type=1&amp;email=&amp;cookie1=D9E71EB4-1C42-ECEB-7880DA46C41B8750&amp;retail=100.0000&amp;qty=1&amp;page=3&amp;frompage=Search%20%3E%20%3CA%20HREF%3D%2Fcatalogue%2Fsearch%2Ecfm%3Femail%3D%26cookie1%3DD9E71EB4%2D1C42%2DECEB%2D7880DA46C41B8750%26search%3Dfluxus%2520box%26search%5Ftype%3D%3Efluxus%20box%3C%2FA%3E]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Watts/Hendricks_e.html Geoff Hendricks] retrieved 23–04–09&lt;/ref&gt; Maciunas enjoyed the piece so much that he published it as an early ''Fluxbox''; many of Watts' contemporary event cards were subsequently included in ''Fluxus 1'', 1963, Maciunas' first year box compiling works by the members of the international avant-garde.&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It must have been Alison Knowles who called me up to say [George Maciunas] was in bad shape with asthma in an Air Force hospital in Germany and needed help or at least some encouragement.... I decided to send something for entertainment, so I stuck some pistol caps on the back of old photos from an Italian magazine of WWI vintage. I remember there was a photo of a priest blessing a propeller of an Italian Air Force fighter plane. The idea was to put the photo on an anvil and hit the front with a hammer until all the caps exploded. Later GM said he got a big kick out of this procedure, especially since after he exploded all the caps, he set up the photos' remains for the locals to continue the destruction.... he said the people beat the shit out of those photos until there was nothing left but fuzz." Robert Watts, 1980&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p62&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Over the years Watts contributed a number of works to Fluxus including a ''Flux Atlas'', a collection of rocks from different countries, and a ''Flux Timekit'', a series of boxes that housed objects that existed in different time scales, such as seeds to be planted, a time-lapsed photo of a speeding bullet and a pocket watch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/mesch.shtml Cold War Games and Postwar Art / Claudia Mesch] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713171331/http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/mesch.shtml |date=July 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also set up ''Implosions Inc.'' with Maciunas to mass-produce novelty items, and helped run the ''Flux Housing Co-Operative'', an artist-run scheme that is held responsible for the rehabilitation and gentrification of SoHo, offering cheap loft spaces to artists throughout the sixties and seventies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0532909/bio Imdb Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Watts himself was the first resident of the first working Flux Co-Op at 80 Wooster Street.&lt;ref&gt;Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p170&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonas Mekas]]' cinematheque and Maciunas' apartment were housed in the same building which soon became the 'central Fluxus loft'.&lt;ref&gt;Mr Fluxus, E Williams and A Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997, p177&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in the notorious ''Flux Mass'', and was one of the very few original artists apart from Maciunas himself to have neither distanced himself from the movement, nor to have been expelled.

==Posthumous Reputation==
Referred to as ''the invisible man of Fluxus and Pop'' by the critic Kim Levin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_3_88/ai_60130219/ Watts and Kaprow, Sid Sachs]&lt;/ref&gt; a term later used as the title of a solo posthumous show in Kassel,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/artistInfo/artist/1994/lang/1 ArtFactsNet&lt;/ref&gt; Watts remains a 'distant, aloof, and enigmatic'&lt;ref name="MailArt"/&gt; figure. In general his reputation has gradually recovered since the late 90s, although not without comments on some of the works' perceived sexism.&lt;ref name="Richard"/&gt; As individual members of Fluxus have increasingly been singled out for re-appraisals, Watts work has been seen in a number of solo and small group shows across the USA and Europe.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'There is something impersonal or phlegmatic in Watts's composition, a deliberately flattened sense of timing. This aspect of his work has not aged as gracefully as have his concerns with commodity and its absurdities. A puckish wit remains where media and message are crisply meshed, as in Portrait Dress, 1965, a see-through vinyl frock with pockets for photographs, or the suite of neon signs in which the signatures of masters like Ingres, Duchamp, and Lichtenstein glow like ads. Other items in this show appeared dated, such as the Lucite sculptures with embedded photographs of food, or the painted plaster casts of bread lined up in a grayscale row, but this was largely because their semiotic jokesterism has been so wholly assimilated by successors that it cannot startle now as it did then.' Frances Richard, 2001&lt;ref name="Richard"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_2_40/ai_79826078]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
His work is held in numerous collections, including The [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=86231 Cloud Music]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Art Institute of Chicago]], The [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], [[Walker Art Center]], Minneapolis, [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris,  [[J.

'''Shusha Realni School''' was a school with six classes, located in Shusha, Azerbaijan. The school's building phase was completed in 1881.

==History==
In the 19th century, new types of schools began to appear in Azerbaijan. During this period, there was only one main school in Baku, and one classical gymnasium in Ganja. This changed after the demand for education in the region grew, two schools were no longer sufficient thus prompting the population of the city to appeal to the Petersburg-Caucasian committee. The appeal stated:
 {{cquote|''"Ganja governor requests to open a sixth-grade real school in Shusha city, based on the willingness and demand of the residents to study (Studying more than 400 students at City School reaffirms this initiative once more) and the desire of the city community. The city community is committed to providing the school with the appropriate building and helping with 7500 manats a year. "''}}

The efforts of the local population led led to the foundation of the school in Shusha on September 20, 1881. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title= Cənubi Qafqazın ən qədim məktəbi|url= http://kaspi.az/az/cenubi-qafqazin-en-qedim-mektebi/?action=disablemobile |website= kaspi.az |accessdate=30 January 2018|language=Azerbaijani}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the first years of the school's opening, 159 pupils were enrolled in the school, consisting of preparatory classes and three main classes, 58 of the students were Azerbaijani, 91 were Armenian, whilst the other 10 were student from other nationalities. In 1886, 7,500 manats were spent on the school.

In 1890, a representative of the Caucasian Ministry of education brought Ziaaddovla Anishirəvan, Mirza Qajar, and anthropologist Shantr. This arrival peaked the interest of the students, which lowered the percentage of absence at the school to 7.64%. The school was an open-minded establishment which promoted the acquisition of languages other than Azerbaijani. In 1890, contrary to the Tbilisi schools, German was not forced upon the students, but the choice to learn it was made available. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title= Böyük elm ocağı Şuşa Realnı Məktəbi |url= https://news.milli.az/culture/136296.html |website= news.milli.az|accessdate=30 January 2018|language=Azerbaijani}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mirza Salah bey Zohrabbeyov, Yusif bey Malikhaqnazarov, Hashim bey Vazirov, were part of the well-known educators of the time, who taught in the School. The two famous Azerbaijani writers [[Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev]] and [[Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli]] were amongst the students who enrolled at the Shusha Realni School.

'''Silk Road Rising''' is a theatre company located in downtown [[Chicago]] dedicated to presenting plays written by individuals of Asian and Middle Eastern descent. Formerly known as Silk Road Theatre Project, the name was changed in 2011 in order to better reflect their mission statement which includes online video plays and documentaries, civic engagement projects, and education programming in addition to live theatre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wbez.org/blog/onstagebackstage/2011-05-31/silk-road-theater-project-spins-new-name-87218&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional [[Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] theatre is located in Pierce Hall in lower level of the [[Chicago Temple Building]] at 77 West Washington Street, directly across from the [[Richard J. Daley Center]]. 

Silk Road Rising is hosted by the First United Methodist Church upstairs; however, they maintain a secular relationship.

==History==

Silk Road Rising was founded in 2002 by life-partners Malik Gillani (a Pakistani Muslim) and Jamil Khoury (a Syrian Orthodox Christian) as a proactive, artistic response to the attacks of September 11, 2001. As Khoury wrote, "First Al Qaeda hijacked Islam, then public anger hijacked our citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.silkroadrising.org/news/humor-me-some-social-change&lt;/ref&gt; As 9-11 second responders, Malik and Jamil set out to use storytelling as a means of challenging the hatred and fanaticism fueling both the attacks, and the backlash that quickly ensued. They work to harness the narratives surrounding Silk Road communities by creating live theatre and online video plays that tell stories through primarily Asian American and Middle Eastern American lenses. By representing communities that intersect and overlap, they advance a polycultural worldview. 

[[File:Silk_Road_Logo.jpg|thumb|right|The Silk Road Rising logo.]]Silk Road Rising espouses three artistic goals:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.silkroadrising.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. Advance the creation of and expand access to works of Asian American and Middle Eastern American artists.

:2. Deepen understanding of Asian and Middle Eastern cultures within the broader community.

:3. Increase access to resources and provide learning opportunities that allow individuals to explore, express and embrace a broader world view.

Since its founding, Silk Road Rising has collaborated with 58 playwrights to produce 24 plays (11 world premieres, 8 commissioned by Silk Road Rising; 9 Midwest premieres; 4 Chicago premieres) and 50 enhanced staged readings.

==Awards==

The [[American Theatre Wing]] awarded Silk Road Rising their National Theatre Company Grant in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/American-Theatre-Wing-Announces-2010-National-Theatre-Company-Grants-20010101|title=American Theatre Wing Announces 2010 National Theatre Company Grants|last=Desk|first=BWW News|work=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silk Road Rising's 2011 production of ''[[Scorched (play)|Scorched]]'' received three [[Jeff Awards]] including Actress in a Supporting Role, Lighting Design and Sound Design.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-11-07/entertainment/ct-ent-1108-jeff-awards-20111107_1_candide-geoff-packard-joseph-jefferson-awards&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Silk Road Rising received [[Chicago Sinfonietta]]'s Chairperson's Award for Diversity and Inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quarles.com/sinfonietta-chairperson-award-diversity-inclusion/&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, May 19, 2013, SAALT (South Asian Americans Leading Together) presented its 2013 ChangeMaker Award to Silk Road Rising in honor of ''Mosque Alert'', "launched on the 10th anniversary of the attacks, is a first of its kind online civic engagement and new play development process that illuminates the challenges faced by Muslim Americans when trying to build houses of worship."&lt;ref&gt;http://saalt.org/2013-changemakers/#sthash.QBoz9ftJ.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 2014 Silk Road Rising was inducted into the [[Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?page=inductees&amp;todo=year |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017032241/http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?page=inductees&amp;todo=year |archivedate=2015-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Southern apse from Pedret''''' is a [[fresco]] painting which was acquired during the 1919-1923 campaign of the Junta de Museus. The artwork originated from the southern [[apsidiole]] of the Church of [[Sant Quirze de Pedret]] and is currently exhibited in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque Art]] collection at the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya]], Barcelona, Spain.&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"&gt;MNAC Website&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
At the end of the eleventh century, the Romanesque mural painting of northern [[Italy]] arrived in [[Catalonia]] with a spread similar to that of Lombardic Romanesque architecture. The work of Italian painters, then, accompanied the architecture and soon had important repercussions.

The clearest example of this Lombardy-related painting is the [[Sant Quirze de Pedret]] ensemble, which stylistically comes close to the paintings of [[Sant Pere in Àger]], [[Santa Maria in Àneu]], and [[Sant Pere in El Burgal]], and to those of [[Saint-Lizier in Couserans]] ([[France]]), preserved in situ.

The church at [[Pedret]], located in the [[Pyrenees]], was thought to have been elaborately decorated (even without a written history of worshippers) since it was located on the roads connecting [[Berga]], [[Bagà]], and [[Cerdanya]], thus it may have been an important location. Scholars agree that the church's original architecture was [[Visigothic]] due to specific construction elements such as the horse-shoe arches, which divide the nave and give entrance to the apses, as well as the insulation of the apses themselves.&lt;ref name="Pijoan 1911"&gt;Pijoan, J., "A Rediscovered School of Romanesque Frescoes", ''The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs'', April 1911, p. 72-73, XIX, XCVII&lt;/ref&gt; However, an additional description of Mozarabic has been given as well to describe the architectural style.&lt;ref name="Miller 1929"&gt;Miller, D.C., ''The Romanesque Mural Paintings of Pedret'', Parnassus, New York, March 15, 1929, I, III, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories on the age of the frescoes have been presented taking into account stylistic trends of the tenth through the twelfth centuries AD and renovations that took place on the church during those time periods as well.&lt;ref name="Post 1930"&gt;Post, Ch. R., ''A History of Spanish Painting'', Cambridge, 1930, I, P. 130-136; 1941, VII (2), p. 540-544&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum where the frescoes currently reside dates them to be from the end of the eleventh century to the beginning of the twelfth.&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"/&gt; Due to the fresco's age, it is probable that the Southern apse from Pedret is one of the oldest of all [[Catalonia|Catalan]] Romanesque wall paintings.&lt;ref name="Pijoan 1911"/&gt;

The [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]] keeps the two side apses from Sant Quirze de Pedret and the [[Museu Diocesà i Comarcal in Solsona]] keeps the decoration of the central apse. Taken together they present an important apocalyptic series in which the subject of the Church is related to the coming of the Day of Judgement in a way that is not frequent, centering on the parable of the wise and foolish Virgins in the southern apsidiole.

== Description ==
The apse's dimensions are 325 x 315 x 320&amp;nbsp;cm,&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"/&gt; and it contains several images although the most prominent one is a fragmentary image of the Wise and Foolish Virgins parable&lt;ref name="Miller 1929"/&gt; found in Matthew 25:1-13.&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"/&gt; Three of the five Wise Virgins' heads have been removed due to historic construction on the church building; however, all figures seem to be wearing similar embroidered [[dalmatic]]s and tunics with close-fitting sleeves that are worn below the open-fitted sleeves of the dalmatics. The Virgins are crowned with bridal crowns resting on caps and are seen wearing spiral earrings. The crowns resemble those found in Rome during the sixth century. Originally, all five Wise Virgins were depicted seated at the marriage supper with burning cressets in their left hands. The Bridegroom figure (Christ) is all but gone however his hand can be seen extending over the table. On the other side of the scene are the five Foolish Virgins. The Foolish Virgins are not clothed in the intricate dalmatics as the Wise Virgins, and they do not wear crowns. Instead, they don coifs that are arranged in folds over their hair. Also unlike the Wise Virgins, the five Foolish Virgins hold their cressets inverted with oil vessels hanging from them. Beneath the virgins is a pattern described as “medallions of beasts.”&lt;ref name="Post 1930"/&gt; A young figure is also pictured sitting upon a church with the head encircled by a nimbus ([[halo (religious iconography)|halo]]). There is a discrepancy as to whether the figure is male or female, and to the object that is held in the figure’s hand. Suggestions have been wand, lily or palm. What can be agreed upon is that this image is a personification of the church.&lt;ref name="Anthony 1951"&gt;Anthony, E.W., ''Romanesque Frescoes'', Princeton, 1951, p. 161-163&lt;/ref&gt; Trace figures of the Archangel Gabriel and the Virgin Mary were once reported, but have since faded entirely although the inscription SCA (Sancta) MARIA was recorded.&lt;ref name="Post 1930"/&gt; An image of the [[Theotokos]] holding the infant Jesus was also present but was covered with mortar during repairs.  There is a fret pattern below the illustrated figures along with simulated drapery present. The apse's window is also decorated with a geometric pattern.&lt;ref name="Anthony 1951"/&gt;

== Composition ==
The composition of this painting is fresco transferred to canvas and the artwork is attributed to the [[Circle of the Master of Pedret]].&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"/&gt;

== Analysis ==
These frescoes are attributed to have created by Circle of the Master Pedret&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"/&gt; and are said to be examples of the early Catalan school.&lt;ref name="Miller 1929"/&gt;  Stylistically their frescoes are linked to similar Italian artwork and show signs of early Byzantine iconography as well as illusionism.&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"/&gt; The parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins found in Pedret is related to earlier religious illustrations such as Coemiterious Maius and the [[Rossano Gospels]]. In the parable, those who are wise and have kept their torches lit are received by the Bridegroom, whereas those who are foolish and who have let their torches become extinguished have been excluded from Paradise.&lt;ref name="Miller 1929"/&gt; This is in reference to [[Judgment Day]] where only those who are prepared will be able to enter the Lord's house.&lt;ref name="MNAC Website"/&gt; This particular parable seems to become extremely popular around the eleventh century. Personification of the Church appears to be influenced by [[Mozarabic liturgy]], whereas reference to the ten virgins is found in other liturgies.&lt;ref name="Miller 1929"/&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''The Englishman's Library''''' was an English book series of the 1840s, a venture of the publisher [[James Burns (publisher)|James Burns]]. It ran eventually to 31 volumes.

The title had been used already in 1824, for ''The Englishman's library'', edited by E. H. L., published by [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Englishman|title=The Englishman's Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdgGAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=1824}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was announced in ambitious fashion in the ''[[British Critic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The British Critic, Quarterly Theological Review, and Ecclesiastical Record|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUUDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA250|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=1839|publisher=C. &amp; J. Rivington, and J. Mawman|pages=250–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was started by [[William Gresley (divine)|William Gresley]] and [[Edward Churton]], with propagandistic aims; the works are still a source for the "[[condition of England]]" debate of the time. Gresley wrote six novels for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Sutherland|title=The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzJ3yNVVqtUC&amp;pg=PA264|accessdate=6 January 2013|date=1 November 1990|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1842-4|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
According to its prospectus, the Library aimed to "unite a popular style with sound Christian principles". The announced authors did not in fact all contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Henry Newman|title=Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman: Littlemore and the parting of friends May 1842-October 1843|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_SWAJPBo5wC&amp;pg=PA300|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=1961|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-925458-3|page=300 note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those behind the series were younger [[High Church]] men who wished to imitate some of the success of the ''[[Tracts for the Times]]''. They were less hostile to the Tractarians than older, more orthodox members of the [[Hackney Phalanx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter B.

'''''The Menin Road''''' is a large oil painting by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] completed in 1919 that depicts a [[World War I|First World War]] battlefield. Nash was commissioned by the [[British War Memorials Committee]] to paint a battlefield scene for the proposed national [[Hall of Remembrance]]. The painting is considered one of the most iconic images of the First World War and is held by the [[Imperial War Museum]].&lt;ref name="WW1Art"/&gt;

==Background==
In September 1914, the British government set up a propaganda department at Wellington House to influence domestic and overseas opinion. In 1916 Wellington House established a section to distribute films and publications such as ''War Pictorial'' and argued for practising artists to be sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].&lt;ref name="Gough1997"/&gt; In 1916, [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Max Aitken]] had established the Canadian War Records Office (CWRO), aiming to create an artistic and photographic record of the activities of Canadian forces. In February 1918, Aitken was made head of the new British [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] (MoI) and subsequently established the British War Memorials Committee (BWMC). The BWMC which began recruiting artists to compile a record of the war in France and at home. Paul Nash had spent the spring of 1917 in the [[Ypres Salient]] and returned there as an official artist in November that year. Along with [[Christopher R W Nevinson|Christopher Nevinson]], Nash made a special study of the experience of the Third Battle of Ypres.&lt;ref name="Gough1997"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Liddle |editor-first=P.

In April 1918, Nash was commissioned by the [[British War Memorials Committee]] to paint a battlefield scene, for the proposed, national [[Hall of Remembrance]], which was never built. He decided to depict a section of the Ypres Salient, that had been devastated during the [[Battle of the Menin Road Ridge]], at the top of the Bassevillebeek Spur, where the British called a cluster of German pill boxes ''Tower Hamlets''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series=History of the Great War Based on Official Documents by Direction of the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence |title=Military Operations France and Belgium 1917: 7 June – 10 November.

Nash knew the area well from the spring of 1917, when he served in the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the Western Front and from later that year, when he returned to the war zone as an official war artist. From late October to November 1917, Nash made some fifty drawings of the front, visiting [[Hill 60 (Ypres)|Hill 60]], [[Zonnebeke|Gheluvelt]], Inverness Copse, [[Zillebeke]] and Sanctuary Wood. Nash had come under shellfire when travelling along the route and had the quick reactions of his driver to thank for his survival.&lt;ref name="Gough"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gough|publisher=Sansom and Company|year=2010|title=A Terrible Beauty: British Artists in the First World War |ISBN=978-1-906593-00-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered Tower Hamlets to be "perhaps the most dreaded and disastrous locality of any area in any of the theatres of War".&lt;ref name=TMRd/&gt;

==Description==
Nash started painting the huge canvas, which was almost {{convert|60|sqft|sqm|abbr=on}}, at Tubbs Farm near [[Chalfont St Peter]] in Buckinghamshire, using a herb drying shed as a studio in June 1918. He shared the space with his brother, [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], who was working on ''Over the Top''. When they had to leave the shed, Paul Nash struggled to find somewhere to work on his painting but eventually, after using two other locations, completed ''The Menin Road'' in a room in [[Gower Street, London]] in February 1919. The room was so small that to view the canvas in full, Nash had to climb out the window.&lt;ref name="Harries"&gt;{{cite book|author=Merion Harries &amp; Susie Harries|publisher=Michael Joseph, The Imperial War Museum &amp; the Tate Gallery|year=1983|title=The War Artists, British Official War Art of the Twentieth Century |isbn=978-0-7181-2314-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The Menin Road'' depicts a landscape of flooded shell craters and trenches while tree stumps, devoid of any foliage, point towards a sky full of clouds and plumes of smoke, bisected by shafts of sunlight resembling gun barrels. Two soldiers at the centre of the picture attempt to follow the, almost, unrecognisable road but appear to be trapped by the landscape.&lt;ref name="WW1Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2008|title=Art from the First World War|isbn=978-1-904897-98-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TMRd&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/20087|title=The Menin Road|author=Imperial War Museum |date= |work=Imperial War Museum Collections Search |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nash composed the picture in three broad strips. The foreground is filled with shell craters and debris, which block access to the road in the middle of the picture. The only possible path, to the side of one of the mud pools, is blocked by a fallen board. Across the centre of the picture, shell holes punch into the road at regular intervals, while debris further breaks up the road, as do the shadows from a line of trees alongside it. Beyond the trees, the battlefield stretches to the horizon, with a wood of stunted trees on the right hand side and to the left a series of seven zigzag streams, that also fail to reach the horizon and escape.&lt;ref name="Gough"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brothers"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gough|publisher=Sansom and Company|year=2014|title=Brothers in Arms: John and Paul Nash and the Aftermath of the Great War|isbn=978-1-908326-52-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nash came to consider this painting to be his finest work.

==Analysis==
In 1997, the art historian Paul Gough wrote that ''The Menin Road'' had captured the inspiration and revulsion of the area. Nash had combined graphic ability with sophisticated design, spreading the composition all over the canvas, creating an anti-hierarchy, where the corners and anonymous spaces contain some of the most important and hideous images in the narrative. Modernist spatial distortion merged with a colour scheme echoing Flemish tapestry, showing the anachronisms of that "phantasmagoric land", in what [[Wyndham Lewis]] called "an epic of mud".&lt;ref name="Gough1997"/&gt;

''The Pearl and the Wave'' was the subject of contemporary curiosity.&lt;ref name="Brodskaya2011"/&gt; The painting was met with praise from art critics for its technique and distinguishing quality.&lt;ref name="Damisch1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hubert Damisch|title=Damisch/Goodman: Judgment of Paris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ioVKL-oapTYC&amp;pg=PA64|accessdate=19 April 2012|date=15 June 1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-13510-6|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Kenyon Cox]] described ''The Pearl and the Wave'' as "the most perfect painting of the nude" in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Van1996"/&gt; Cox identified some features in the painting which he described as "grace of attitude", the well-rounded but slim body of a young woman, the visible dimple in the shoulder, the "savoring of subtle line", the "loveliness of the color", the "solid yet mysterious modelling", and the "perfection of delicate surface". Cox believed these features make this painting what he calls "a pure masterpiece".&lt;ref name="Van1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenyon Cox|title=Old Masters and New: Essays in Art Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b44R00H3rC0C&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=19 April 2012|date=1 July 2004|publisher=Digital Antiquaria|isbn=978-1-58057-280-4|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Bailey Van Hook identified ''The Pearl and the Wave'' as one of the examples of nude paintings where the subject woman is shown lying down sluggishly for the gratification of the looker-on who she describes as "[[Voyeurism|voyeuristic viewer]]".&lt;ref name="Van1996"/&gt; Nineteenth-century French art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]] commented that the woman in the painting may be "a Parisian ''modiste'' ... lying in wait for a millionaire gone astray in this wild spot."&lt;ref name="Bernheimer1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Bernheimer|title=Figures of Ill Repute: Representing Prostitution in Nineteenth-Century France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jaSPKb2kJ5wC&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=19 April 2012|date=22 May 1997|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-1947-4|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodor Esbern Philipsen''' (10 June 1840, [[Copenhagen]] - 3 March 1920, Copenhagen) was a Danish painter of Jewish ancestry; known for landscapes and animal portraits. He also did small figures in wax and clay.

==Biography==
He was born to a cultured merchant family and learned to draw at an early age.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=870 Biographical notes] @ Kunstindeks Danmark.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, however, he was primarily interested in animals, so he went to study agriculture at his uncle's estate near [[Slangerup]]. In the 1860s, one of his brothers introduced him to the painter, [[Hans Smidth]], which made him decide to become an artist. He began his studies at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] with {{ill|Carl Bøgh|da}} and later came under the influence of [[Frederik Vermehren]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt;

He was also familiar with the animal portraits of [[Johan Thomas Lundbye]] and the 17th-century painter [[Paulus Potter]].&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[http://denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Theodor_Esbern_Philipsen Brief biography] @ Den Store Danske.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, he was awarded the {{ill|Neuhausenske Prize|da|De Neuhausenske Præmier}} for his painting of horses swimming. In the 1880s, he began painting en [[plein aire]] and began to show some elements of [[Impressionism]].

At the age of thirty-five, concerned that his images were not realistic enough, he went to Paris to study with [[Léon Bonnat]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; There, he practiced intensive [[croquis]] drawing; to capture the basics of position and movement. He also obtained knowledge of the radical trends in French art through his friend, [[Rémy Cogghe]], with whom he spent some time in Spain and Italy.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; This all came together in a distinctive style. His favorite places for painting were  [[Saltholm]] and [[Amager]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt;

In the winter of 1884-1885, [[Paul Gauguin]] made a visit to Copenhagen. Philipsen approached him for some advice and was shown how to use small brushes with quick, firm strokes.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; They remained friends for life.

In 1890, he received the [[Eckersberg Medal]]. Around 1905, he began to suffer from an eye disease that interfered with his ability to paint.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; In 1915, he was awarded the [[Thorvaldsen Medal]]. He is generally credited with establishing Impressionism as an important aspect of Danish painting.

'''Uri (Uli)''' is the name given to the traditional designs drawn by the [[Igbo people]] of [[Nigeria]]. Uri drawings are strongly [[linear]] and do not have deep perspective; they do, however, balance positive and negative space.  Designs are frequently [[asymmetry|asymmetrical]], and are often painted spontaneously.  ''Uri'' generally is not sacred, apart from those images painted on the walls of [[shrine]]s and created in conjunction with some community rituals.

The drawing of ''uri'' was once practiced throughout most of [[Igboland]], although by 1970 it had lost much of its popularity, and was being kept alive by a handful of contemporary artists.  It was usually practiced by women, who would decorate each other's bodies with dark [[dye]]s to prepare for village events, such as [[marriage]], title taking, and [[funeral]]s; designs would sometimes be produced for the most important market days as well.  Designs would last about a week.

Most ''uri'' designs were named, and many differed among various Igbo regions.  Some were abstract, using patterns such as [[zigzag]]s and [[concentric]] [[circle]]s, while others stood for household objects like [[chair|stool]]s and [[Pottery|pots]].  Some represented animals such as [[Pythonidae|python]]s and [[lizard]]s; others showed plants, like [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] leaves, or heavenly bodies, including a crescent [[moon]] and [[star]]s.  Still other designs depicted cutting and other actions.

The use of ''uri'' was not limited to the human body.  Igbo women would also paint murals of designs on the walls of compounds and houses.  These generally used four colors which could be created from natural bases easily found in the area; [[black]] was made from [[charcoal]], [[red]]dish [[brown]] from the [[camwood]] tree, [[yellow]] from either soil or tree bark, and [[white]] from clay.  When the [[Great Britain|British]] invaded the area at the turn of the twentieth century, they brought with them a commercial [[Bluing (fabric)|laundry additive]] which some painters used to create [[blue]] pigment.  ''Uri'' was not only meant to express a specific message. It was also meant to beautify the female body and buildings to which it was applied, as beauty is equated with [[morality]] in Igbo culture.

Today the practice of ''uri'' is being kept alive by, among others, Anam people who continues to pass the knowledge and use the culture and the artists of the [[Nsukka group]], who have appropriated its designs and incorporated them into other media.

[[File:Girls playing video games in Japan.jpg|thumb|Women playing ''[[The House of the Dead III]]'' in an [[amusement arcade]] in [[Video gaming in Japan|Japan]], 2005.]]

The relationship between '''women and video games''' has received extensive academic, corporate, and social attention. Since the 1990s,&lt;ref name=polygonNoGirls /&gt; female [[gamer]]s have commonly been regarded as a minority, but industry surveys have shown that in time the gender ratio has become closer to equal, and since the 2010s, women have been found to make up about half of all gamers. [[Sexism in video gaming]], including [[sexual harassment]] and the [[Gender representation in video games|underrepresentation of women as characters in games]], is an increasing topic of discussion in [[video game culture]].

Advocates for increasing the number of female gamers stress the problems attending disenfranchisement of women from one of the fastest-growing cultural realms as well as the largely untapped nature of the female gamer market. Efforts to include greater female participation in the medium have addressed the problems of gendered advertising, social stereotyping, and the lack of female video game creators (coders, [[Video game developer|developers]], producers, etc.). The term "'''girl gamer'''" has been used as a [[Reappropriation|reappropriated term]] for female players to describe themselves, but it has also been criticized as counterproductive or offensive.

== Demographics of female players ==
{{See also|Video game#Demographics}}
Female participation in gaming is increasing. According to a [[Entertainment Software Association]] survey, women players in the United States increased from 40% in 2010 to 48% in 2014.&lt;ref name="wsjWomenHalf"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gaming-no-longer-a-mans-world-1408464249|title=Women Now Make Up Almost Half of Gamers|first1=Sven|last1=Grundberg|first2=Jens|last2=Hansegard|date=20 August 2014|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/22/adult-women-gamers-outnumber-teenage-boys/|title=Study: More women than teenage boys are gamers|date=August 22, 2014|first=Gail |last=Sullivan|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, despite the dominant perception that most gamers are men,&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015" /&gt; the ratio of female to male gamers is balanced, mirroring [[Human sex ratio|the population at large]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/adult-women-largest-gaming-demographic/?fb=ss&amp;prtnr=nerdist|title=Adult women are now the largest demographic in gaming|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=2014|website=The Daily Dot|publisher=Nicholas White|access-date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] study found that among teens, 65% of men and 35% of women describe themselves as daily gamers. This trend was found to be stronger the younger the age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Lenhart | first=Amanda | last2=Kahna | first2=Joseph | last3=Middaugh | first3=Ellen | last4=Macgill | first4=Alexandra Rankin | last5=Evans | first5=Chris | last6=Vitak | first6=Jessica | date=16 September 2008 | title=Teens, Video Games, and Civics | publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] | publication-place=Washington D.C. | url=http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2008/PIP_Teens_Games_and_Civics_Report_FINAL.pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that while adult men are significantly more likely to play [[Console game|console games]] than adult women, on other platforms they are equally likely to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Lenhart | first=Amanda | last2=Jones | first2=Sydney | last3=Macgill | first3=Alexandra Rankin | date=7 December 2008 | title=Pew Internet Project Data Memo | publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] | url=http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2008/PIP_Adult_gaming_memo.pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even in this area, the numbers are moving towards equality: in 2013, [[Nintendo]] reported that half of its users were women,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.geekwire.com/2013/dudes-38-xbox-users-female-51-kids/ |title= Not just dudes: 38% of Xbox users female, 51% have kids |publisher= Geek Wire |year= 2013 |accessdate= 2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 another Pew study found that more American women (42%) than men (37%) owned video game consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frank|first1=Allegra|title=New survey findings show more women own game consoles than men|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/4/9669110/pew-research-center-female-gamers-statistics|accessdate=6 November 2015|work=Polygon|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that female participation increased with age (61% of women and 57% of men aged 45 to 64 played games).&lt;ref name=variety2013&gt;{{citation |url= https://variety.com/2013/digital/features/womengamers1200683299-1200683299/ |title= Videogame Biz: Women Still Very Much in the Minority |publisher= Variety |year= 2013 |accessdate= 2013-10-20 |author= Marc Graser }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-2015 survey reported by UKIE indicates that 42% of UK gamers are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ukie.org.uk/sites/default/files/cms/UK%20Games%20Industry%20Fact%20Sheet%2026%20January%202016.pdf |title= UK Video Games Fact Sheet |publisher= The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment |date= 26 August 2016 |accessdate= 8 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data collection ===
In North America, national demographic surveys have been conducted yearly by the U.S. [[Entertainment Software Association]] (ESA){{efn|The ESA was known as the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) prior to 16 July 2003.}} since at least 1997, and the Canadian [[Entertainment Software Association of Canada]] (ESAC) since 2006. Other organizations including the Australian/New-Zealander [[Interactive Games &amp; Entertainment Association]] (IGEA) since 2005 collect and publish demographic data on their constituent populations on a semi-regular basis. In Europe, the regional [[Interactive Software Federation of Europe]] (ISFE) and numerous smaller national groups like the [[Belgian Entertainment Association]] (BEA), the [[Nederlandse Vereniging van Producenten en Importeurs van beeld- en geluidsdragers]] (NVPI), and the Association for UK Interactive Entertainment (UKIE) have also begun to collect data on female video gamers since 2012. One-off market research studies and culture surveys have been produced by a wide variety of other sources including some segments of [[video game journalism|the gaming press]] and other culture writers since the 1980s as well.

Not only has the general female gaming population been tracked, but the spread of this population has been tracked over many facets of gaming. For more than 10 years, groups like the ESA and ESAC have gathered data on the gender of video game purchasers, the percentage of women gamers within certain age brackets, and the average number of years women gamers have been gaming. The ESAC in particular has gone into great depth reporting age-related segmentation of the market between both male and female gamers. Other statistics have been collected from time to time on a wide variety of facets influencing the video game market.

=== Historical prevalence ===
*The author of ''[[Pac-Man]]'', [[Toru Iwatani]], attempted to appeal to a wider audience—beyond the typical demographics of young boys and teenagers. His intention was to attract girls to arcades because he found there were very few games that were played by women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021|title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man|first=Chris|last=Morris|date=March 3, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Electronic Games'' reported in 1982 that it was "the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of women as players";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Worley|first=Joyce|title=Women Join the Arcade Revolution|journal=[[Electronic Games]]|date=May 1982|volume=1|issue=3|pages=30–33 [33]|url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1982-05/Electronic_Games_Issue_03_Vol_01_03_1982_May#page/n31/mode/2up|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the nine arcade games that ''How to Win Video Games'' (1982) discussed, ''Pac-Man'' was the only one with women as a majority of players.&lt;ref name="howtowin"&gt;{{Cite book |title=How to Win Video Games |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1982 |isbn=0-671-45841-8 |pages=82-90 | url=https://archive.org/stream/book_how_to_win_video_games#page/n81/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the sequel [[Ms. Pac-Man]], launched in 1981, featured a female protagonist.
*In May 1982, sociologist Sidney J. Kaplan reported the composition of [[arcade video game]] players to be roughly 80% male and 20% female.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Sidney J. "The Image of Amusement Arcades and Differences in Male and Female Video Game Playing". ''[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]''. Vol.17. Pp.93–98. June 1983. {{ISSN|0022-3840}} (Presented as "Amusement Arcades: Video Games and Differences in Male and Female Participation" before the [[North Central Sociological Association]]. Detroit Michigan. May 1982 annual meeting.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''How to Win Video Games'' estimated that men were 95% of ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]'' and 90% of ''[[Omega Race]]'' players, while women were half the players of ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and three other games.{{r|howtowin}}
*In 1983, researcher John W. Trinkaus published findings that there were 8 male players to every 3 female players in video game arcades.&lt;ref&gt;Trinkaus, John. W. "Arcade Video Games: An Informal Look", ''[[Psychological Reports]]''. Vol.52, No.2. Pg.586. 1983. {{ISSN|0033-2941}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leroux, Yvan and Michel Pépin. "Jeu Sur Micro-Ordinateur et Différences Liées au Sexe". ''[[Revue des Sciences de l'Education]]''. Vol.XII, No.2. Pp.173-196. 1986. {{ISSN|0318-479X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1983, a [[Coleco]] executive stated at the [[Boston Computer Society]] that the target audience for the new [[Coleco Adam|Adam]] home computer, based on its [[ColecoVision]] console, was "boys age 8 to 16 and their fathers. We believe those are the two groups that really fuel computer purchases". When audience members booed, he added that the marketing strategy was based on consumer research.&lt;ref name="coleco19830928"&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg_I9TGYM-w |title=Coleco Presents The Adam Computer System |date=2016-05-03 |publisher=YouTube |orig-year=1983-09-28 |time=44:30 |quote=We're doing that with five new television commercials, which have just been completed, and which will be shown in conjunction with the Adam launch date.

We believe those are the two groups that really fuel computer purchases, [boos] and we've directed right at 'em [more boos] - oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Women, we've a commercial for you, trust me, but the key point is that our research, which is consumer research, directed that thought [inaudible] from the research, and we've directed our commercials at that target user group.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1988, Epyx CEO [[David Shannon Morse]] stated that ''[[California Games]]'' was the first game from his company to appeal equally to boys and girls during [[playtesting]].&lt;ref name="compute198809"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-09-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_100_1988_Sep#page/n11/mode/2up | title=Epyx Grows with David Morse | work=Compute! | date=September 1988 | accessdate=November 10, 2013 |author1=Ferrell, Keith |author2=Keizer, Gregg | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1988, ''[[Playthings (magazine)|Playthings]]'' reported that among primary video game users, women represented 21% of all gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Main |first = Peter |title= Column: How high is up for video games? (forecast for 1989) |publisher= [[Playthings (magazine)|Playthings]] |date = 1 October 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1988, a study by [[Nintendo]] reported that 27% of [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] players in the United States were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/06Kahle001551#page/n7/mode/2up|title=Video Game: Past, Present and Future. An Industry Overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 1993 self-reported survey by ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' found that 7% of its readers were female.&lt;ref name="cgw199304"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=105 | title=What You've Been Playing Lately | work=Computer Gaming World | date=1993-04-01 | accessdate=7 July 2014 | page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1994, a survey by ''[[Electronic Games]]'' reported that, among American women gamers, the [[Sega Genesis]] was most popular, with 75% ownership, followed by the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] with 58.3% ownership, the [[Game Boy]] with 58%, and [[MS-DOS]] with 50%.&lt;ref&gt;''Electronic Games'', issue 23 (August 1994), pages 36-42&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1997, Mattel, Inc. released [[Barbie Fashion Designer]], selling over 600,000 copies. The game was considered an important step in advancing an interest in the design of games for women.&lt;ref name="Dickey2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dickey|first1=Michele D.|title=Girl gamers: the controversy of girl games and the relevance of female-oriented game design for instructional design|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|volume=37|issue=5|year=2006|pages=785–793|issn=00071013|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8535.2006.00561.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1998, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' stated that the video game market for young girls was "exploding" with titles such as ''[[The American Girls Premiere]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8460578.html|title=VIRTUAL EQUALITY?

=== Self-identification as gamers ===
While 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as [[gamer]]s, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female [[Pc game|PC gamers]] in the U.S. consider themselves to be [[Gamer#Dedication spectrum|core or hardcore gamers]].&lt;ref name="pcgamerFemale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/researchers-find-that-female-pc-gamers-outnumber-males/|title=Researchers find that female PC gamers outnumber males|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superdataWhyAll"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/why-all-gamers-matter/|title=SuperData Research - Games data and market research  » Why ALL gamers matter — my view as a female games analyst|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 a [[EEDAR]] survey found that nearly 60 percent of female gamers played on mobile devices and that 63 percent of these female mobile gamers played online multiplayer mobile games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/10/03/nearly-60-of-mobile-gamers-are-women-says-analyst/ | title= Nearly 60% of mobile gamers are women, says analyst|publisher=Vg247.com|accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connotations of "gamer" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.&lt;ref name="nytimesShunLabel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/technology/personaltech/women-who-play-games-shun-gamer-label.html|last=McPhate|first=Mike|work=The New York Times|title=Women Who Play Games Shun 'Gamer' Label}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Girl gamers" or "gamer girls" is a label for women who regularly play games. While some critics have advocated use of the label as a [[Reappropriation|reappropriated term]],&lt;ref name=hex /&gt; others have described the term as unhelpful,&lt;ref name=ng /&gt;&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; offensive, and even harmful or misleading. The word "girl", for example, has been seen as an inherently age-linked term that glosses over the difference between women over 30 and younger women.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; The term "girl gamer" rather than simply "gamer" has also been described as perpetuating the minority position of female gamers.&lt;ref name=hex /&gt; For many critics uncomfortable with the term "girl gamer", its over-embracement may lead to the perpetuation of negative stereotypes&lt;ref name=hex /&gt; of female gamers as [[Sexual objectification|oversexualized]], casual, and sometimes defiant or confrontational.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, Tyler. ''[http://www.gamesradar.com/the-top-7-girl-gamer-stereotypes The Top 7... Girl gamer stereotypes]''. [[GamesRadar]]. 18 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trinder, Aja. ''[http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/technology/the-box/646926/Not-a-Girl-Gamer-just-a-gamer Not a Girl Gamer just a gamer]''. [[Stuff.co.nz]]. 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn can result in poor game design.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; These critics submit that there is no single definition of a female gamer, and that women gamers are as diverse as any other group of people.&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt;

A lack of role models for female gamers&lt;ref name=brown&gt;Brown, Janelle. ''[https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1996/11/516 Girl Gamers: Sugar, Spice, Everything Profitable?]''. [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]. 19 November 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; contributes to a feeling that they should edit their femininity in order to maintain credibility as a gamer, and that they must fit into the caricatured role of the "girl gamer" in order to be accepted.&lt;ref name=hex /&gt; Negative stereotyping of female video game players as "girl gamers" quite often comes from male gamers who have themselves been negatively stereotyped by the broader society.&lt;ref name=hex /&gt; Social stigma against games has influenced some women to distance themselves from the term "[[gamer]]", even though they may play regularly.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt;&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newmediaDoYou"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?

Controversially, some{{which|date=December 2015}} critics have suggested that the term "gamer" is endemic to the stereotypical male audience and has become outmoded by the industry's changing demographics.&lt;ref name="newstatesmanLoveGames" /&gt;&lt;ref name="slateJournalismOver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/09/gamergate_explodes_gaming_journalists_declare_the_gamers_are_over_but_they.html|title=Gaming Journalism Is Over|first=David|last=Auerbach|date=4 September 2014|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genre preferences ==
{{See also|Non-violent video game#Gender perspective}}

There are considerable differences between the [[video game genre]]s preferred, on average, by women and men. According to a 2017 report by the video game analytics company Quantic Foundry, based on surveys of about 270,000 gamers, the following proportions of gamers within a genre are women or men, respectively:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yee|first1=Nick|title=Beyond 50/50: Breaking Down The Percentage of Female Gamers By Genre|url=http://quanticfoundry.com/2017/01/19/female-gamers-by-genre/|website=Quantic Foundry|accessdate=20 January 2017|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While male audiences prefer fast-paced explosive action and combat,&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; women tend to prefer in-game communication&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; and interpersonal relationships (character development and plot dynamics).&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; Women have also been shown to prefer [[role-playing video game]]s to first-person shooters,&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; and [[Thomas W. Malone]] of Stanford University found that girls preferred to play a [[Hangman (game)|Hangman]] video game over a darts simulation that boys enjoyed.&lt;ref name="malone198112"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-12/1981_12_BYTE_06-12_Computer_Games#page/n259/mode/2up | title=What Makes Computer Games Fun? | work=BYTE | date=December 1981 | accessdate=12 August 2015 | author=Malone, Thomas W. | pages=258–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In-game activities may also differ between the sexes in games with less linear plots such as the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]]. Women are often characterized as preferring story-driven games or constructive games like ''[[The Sims]]'' or ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'', but this is not universally true.&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt; In 2013, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that thirty percent of women were playing more violent games. Of this 30%, 20% played [[Call of Duty]] and 15% played [[Grand Theft Auto]].&lt;ref name=variety2013/&gt; There has been persistent female interest in [[action-adventure game]]s and [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPGs]] like ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and ''[[Second Life]]''.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; Compared to men, female MMORPG players tend to place more emphasis on socialization relative to achievement-oriented play. This emphasis on socialization extends beyond just the game itself: In a study published in the ''Journal of Communication'' in 2009, researchers found that 61% of female MMORPG players played with a romantic partner, compared to 24% of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Dmitri|last1=Williams|first2=Mia|last2=Consalvo|first3=Scott|last3=Caplan|first4=Nick|last4=Yee|title=Looking for Gender: Roles and Behaviors Among Online Gamers|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2009|volume=59|issue=4|pages=700–725|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2009.01453.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data collected by Quantic Foundry in 2016, the primary motivations why people play video games differ, on average, by gender. While men frequently want most to compete with others and destroy things, women often want most to complete challenges and immerse themselves in other worlds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yee|first1=Nick|title=7 Things We Learned About Primary Gaming Motivations From Over 250,000 Gamers|url=http://quanticfoundry.com/2016/12/15/primary-motivations/|website=Quantic Foundry|accessdate=20 January 2017|date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While video games and advertising were initially gender-neutral, advertising began to narrow its focus to young boys as a [[target market]] following the [[video game crash of 1983]].&lt;ref name="polygonNoGirls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed|last=Lien|first=Tracey|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|title=No Girls Allowed|date=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="overlandBrendan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://overland.org.au/previous-issues/issue-218/feature-brendan-keogh/|title=Hackers, gamers and cyborgs|publisher=overland.org.au|date= Autumn 2015|first= Brendan|last=Keogh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although commercial hits such as ''[[Myst]]'' and ''The Sims'' appealed to women, these were nonetheless seen by some as being outside the gaming mainstream. Critic [[Ian Bogost]] opined, "We're looking at where there isn't diversity and we're saying those games are the most valid games."&lt;ref name="polygonNoGirls" /&gt; Industry studies on the lack of women in gaming have also suffered at times from biases of interpretation. Kevin Kelly of [[Joystiq]] has suggested that a high degree of [[circular reasoning]] is evident when male developers use focus groups and research numbers to determine what kinds of games girls play. After making a bad game that targets those areas suggested by the marketing research, the game's lack of popularity among both genders is often attributed to the incorrect prejudice that "girls don't play games" rather than the true underlying problems such as poor quality and playability of the game. Whereas market data and research are important to reveal that markets exist, argues Kelly, they shouldn't be the guiding factor in how to make a game that appeals to girls.&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt; The argument has also been advanced that emphasis on market research is often skewed by the participants in the study. In studies on male gamers of the baby boomer generation, for example, players displayed a marked aversion to violence. The incorrect conclusion that could be drawn from this result—that men dislike violent games—may also be comparable to incorrect conclusions drawn from some female-oriented gaming studies.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; It has been suggested that developers can learn what girls want in a game by observing similarities in how different girl teams will react to and modify a game if given the opportunity.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt;

[[File:Casio-Loopy-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|The [[Casio Loopy]], created by [[Casio]] and released in October 1995 in Japan, was unique in that the marketing for it was completely targeted to female gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Leah B.|title=Man Sets Guinness World Record for Largest Game Collection|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/24/man-sets-guinness-world-record-for-largest-game-collection|publisher=[[IGN.com]]|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the past, "[[girl games]]" have frequently been created by adapting girl-oriented material in other media like ''[[The Baby-sitters Club]]'', ''[[Barbie]]'', and ''[[Nancy Drew]]''&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; while leaving male-targeted genres such as sport and driving sims, role playing games, and first person shooters to the boys.&lt;ref name=yap /&gt; This has begun to change, however, with the expansion of entrepreneurial feminism and the concept of "games by girls for girls" that has been embraced by companies such as [[Her Interactive]], [[Silicon Sisters]] and [[Purple Moon]]—all video gaming start ups that are female owned and largely female staffed. Creating games designed with regard to sociological, psychological, and cognitive research into girls' cultural interests, such companies hope to awaken a female-only market emphasizing fundamental differences between what girls want and what boys want in gaming.&lt;ref name=nzegwu /&gt; The movement to expand the existing market to include women through the development of gender-neutral games has also had a number of advocates. Critics have proposed that female gamers, especially older female gamers&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; prefer gender-neutral games such as ''[[Tetris]]'', ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?]]'', or the ''[[King's Quest]]'' games to "girl games".&lt;ref name=brown /&gt;&lt;ref name=yap /&gt;

In examining game play habits at [[Internet café]]s, South Korea has seen a rise in female gamers publicly playing games such as ''[[Lineage (video game)|Lineage]]'', while in other Asian countries this kind of public female gaming has remained rare; similarly, games such as ''[[Tamagotchi]]'' are seen as a gender neutral in Japan, but have been regarded as girls' games in the West.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; In other cases, female trends in one country may be indicators of associated changes in others, as in the case of a rising number of female ''Lineage'' players in Korea having led to increased number of female ''Lineage'' players in Taiwan. In Japan the rise of [[Kawaii|cute culture]] and its associated marketing has made gaming accessible for girls, and this trend has also carried over to Taiwan and recently China (both countries previously having focused mostly on [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMOs]] and where parents usually place harsher restrictions on daughters than on sons).&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt;

== Skill levels ==
An aspect of game design that has been identified as negatively impacting female interest is the degree of expertise with gaming conventions and familiarity with [[Game controller|game controls]] required to play the game.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt; In-game tutorials have been found to bring both sexes into games faster,&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt; and new controllers such as Nintendo's [[Wii Remote]], Microsoft's [[Kinect]], and the [[Game controller#Variants|various rhythm game controllers]] have affected demographics by making games easier to pick up and by providing a level playing-field.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt; This trend has continued through the efforts of [[Nintendo]] in its release of the [[Wii]].&lt;ref name=watts&gt;Watts, Steve. ''[http://www.1up.com/news/report-suggests-female-gaming-rise Report Suggests Female Gaming on the Rise] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055758/http://www.1up.com/news/report-suggests-female-gaming-rise |date=2013-10-23 }}''.

In a 2016 study published in the ''Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication,'' researchers found that, after controlling for confounds such as the amount of play time and guild membership, women players advance at least as fast as men do in two MMOs, [[EverQuest II]] and [[cmn:剑侠情缘网络版III|Chevaliers' Romance III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shen|first=Cuihua|last2=Ratan|first2=Rabindra|last3=Cai|first3=Y.

=== Male behavior towards female gamers ===
{{Main|Sexism in video gaming}}
A 2015 study found that lower-skilled male players of ''[[Halo 3]]'' were more hostile towards teammates with a female voice, but behaved more submissively to players with a male voice. Higher-skilled male players, on the other hand, behaved more positively towards female players. The authors argued the male hostility towards female gamers in terms of [[evolutionary psychology]], writing, "female-initiated disruption of a male hierarchy incites hostile behaviour from poor performing males who stand to lose the most status".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613|pmid=26176699|title=Insights into Sexism: Male Status and Performance Moderates Female-Directed Hostile and Amicable Behaviour|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=7|pages=e0131613|year=2015|last1=Kasumovic|first1=Michael M.|last2=Kuznekoff|first2=Jeffrey H.|pmc=4503401|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1031613K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in competitive gaming ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2014}}

The top female players in [[Esports|competitive gaming]] mainly get exposure in female-only tournaments, including such games as ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]'', and ''[[StarCraft II]]''. Canadian ''StarCraft II'' player [[Sasha Hostyn]] (Scarlett) first gained notoriety in the open qualifiers of IGN ProLeague 4, where she defeated top-tier Korean players. She is well known for being one of the few non-Korean players who can play at the same skill level as male Korean players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/sasha-scarlett-hostyn-starcraft-esports/|title=Meet Scarlett, the 20-year-old woman who's blazing trails in 'StarCraft'|website=The Daily Dot|publisher=dailydot.com|date=21 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029105206/http://www.dailydot.com/esports/sasha-scarlett-hostyn-starcraft-esports/|archivedate=29 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[Street Fighter x Tekken]]'' player ArisBakhtanians commented on the lack of female players in the community, saying "[[sexual harassment]] is part of a culture, and if you remove that from the fighting game community, it's not the fighting game community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/02/is-pervasive-sexism-holding-the-professional-fighting-game-community-back/|title=Is pervasive sexism holding the professional fighting game community back?|publisher=ARS Technica|author=Kyle Orland|date=29 Feb 2012|accessdate=27 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologized for his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/women-are-gamers-but-largely-absent-from-e-sports/|title=Women are gamers, but largely absent from "e-sports"|publisher=ARS Technica|author=Casey Johnston|date=18 Feb 2014|accessdate=27 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, organizers for a ''[[Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft|Hearthstone]]'' tournament in Finland were criticized for limiting registrations to male players only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/hearthstone-heroes-warcraft-tournament-ban-female-finland|title=Hearthstone gaming tournament bans women players – ignites 'sexism' row|publisher=theguardian.com|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the tournament being an offline qualifier for the IeSF World Championship, with its ''Hearthstone'' tournament only open to male players. The winner of the Finnish qualifier would risk not being eligible to participate in the main event if that player were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/02/hearthstone-tournament/|title=Hearthstone tournament explains why women aren't allowed to play [updated]|publisher=pcgamer.com|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IeSF organization ultimately removed the male-only restriction from all of their tournaments, and in turn the Finnish qualifier that originally sparked the controversy also removed this restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/03/iesf-removes-male-only-restriction-from-its-e-sports-tournaments/|title=IeSF removes male-only restriction from its e-sports tournaments|publisher=pcgamer.com|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Kayla "Squizzy" Squires became the first female ''[[Call of Duty]]'' player to turn professional upon qualifying for the Call of Duty World League in the Australian region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The First Female To Qualify For The Call Of Duty World League Is Australian|url = http://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/12/the-first-female-to-qualify-for-the-call-of-duty-world-league-is-australian/|website = www.kotaku.com.au|accessdate = 17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

League of Legends player Maria (Sakuya) Creveling, who at the time was known as Remilia or (Remi), finished first in the 2015 Challenger Series Summer Split along with her teammates Renegades which qualified the team for the 2016 North America League Championship Series (NA LCS) Spring Split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thescoreesports.com/lol/news/11201-sakuya-on-returning-to-competitive-lol-and-entering-the-latin-american-scene|title=Sakuya on returning to competitive LoL and entering the Latin American scene|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became both the first female and also the first transgender player to compete professionally in the (NA LCS).

In 1989, according to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', women constituted only 3% of the gaming industry.&lt;ref name=variety2013 /&gt; In 2013, Gary Carr (the creative director of [[Lionhead Studios]]) predicted that within the next 5 to 10 years, the games development workforce would be 50% female.&lt;ref name=variety2013 /&gt; According to [[Gamasutra]]'s Game Developer Salary Survey 2014, women in the United States made 86 cents for every dollar men made.

=== Support groups for women in the video game industry ===

==== WIGSIG (Women In Games Special Interest Group) ====
WIGSIG is a special interest group of IDGA (International Game Developers Association). The group was formed in order to foster a positive impact on the game industry regarding gender balance in the workplace and/or marketplace. It provides a community, resources, and opportunities for people in the gaming industry. It also works to assess the numbers of the women in the games industry and tracks the changes of these numbers over time. Additionally, it works to recruit women into the games industry and make the field more attractive to women while providing them with the support and connections they need to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.igda.org/about/ |title=About &amp;#124; WIGSIG |publisher=Women.igda.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women in Games International ====
Founded in 2005, Women in Games International (WIGI), made up of both female and male professionals, works to promote the inclusion and advancement of women in the global games industry.
WIGI promotes diversity in video game development, publishing, media, education and workplaces, based on a fundamental belief that increased equality and camaraderie among genders can make global impacts for superior products, more consumer enjoyment and a stronger gaming industry.
Women In Games International stands as strong advocates for issues crucial to the success of women and men in the games industry, including a better work/life balance, healthy working conditions, increased opportunities for success and resources for career support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getwigi.com/ |title=missionstatement |publisher=getwigi.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getwigi.com|title=WIGI Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== WIGJ (Women In Games Jobs) ====
WIGJ is a group that works to recruit, preserve, and provide support for the advancement of women in the games industry by positively and energetically endorsing female role models and providing encouragement and information to women interested in working in the gaming field.  The group was incorporated under the UK's [[Companies Act 2006]] on June 2, 2011 as a "not for profit" or Community Interest Company. Companies in the game development industry have, in recent years, been seeking to balance the gender ratios on development teams and consoles like the [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS]] have seen increased numbers of female players.  In addition to using this growing interest in women in the game developing industry, WIGJ works to put more women in traditional game development with less stigma attached to them.  WIGJ seeks to help women find their place within the growing and rewarding field of game development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womeningamesjobs.com |title=(WIGJ) for more women in gaming |publisher=Womeningamesjobs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in video game streaming ==

The relationship between women and [[video game live streaming]] has been a rocky one. As streaming services such as YouTube and Twitch became increasingly popular, female gamers began to jump on board. Many notable streamers arose from this streaming revolution including Hafu, Glitterlanced, and Sovitia.

Geneviève Forget, a video game streamer, states in a Kotaku interview that "Harassment does happen in my stream chat from time to time that people start discussing my appearance but it really isn't the focus on my stream. I'd like to think people come back to watch it because it is quite entertaining and I try to interact with the chat as much as possible."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = They're Attractive, They're Women, And They Play Games Live On The Internet. But They're Not 'Camwhores.'|url = http://kotaku.com/5982137/theyre-attractive-theyre-women-and-they-play-games-live-on-the-internet-but-theyre-not-camwhores|website = Kotaku|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female streamers are most often criticized for purportedly using services like Twitch as an alternative to soft-core cam websites to solicit donations by performing sexually suggestive acts. Many male gamers, who dominate the industry, correlate female streamers' success to this behavior. Vivyan Andrew, a 29-year-old twitch streamer addresses this in an interview with Kotaku, ""Yes, if you're a woman and you're streaming, the misconceptions are that you're seeking attention and/or trying to use your 'assets' to receive donations.

Critics attribute the seeming lack of female interest in video games to the negative [[portrayal of women in video games]] and to [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] attitudes common among professional and hardcore gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/misc/22786_To_My_Someday_Daughter.html|author=Geordie Tait|title=To My Someday Daughter|publisher=Starcitygames.com|accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 [[Twitter]] discussion among women working in games, collated under the [[hashtag]] ''#1reasonwhy'', argued that sexist practices such as the oversexualization of female characters, disinterest in topics that matter to women, as well as workplace harassment and unequal pay for men and women were common in the games industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Locker|first=Melissa|title=#1ReasonWhy: Women Take to Twitter to Talk about Sexism in Video Game Industry|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/27/1reasonwhy-women-take-to-twitter-to-talk-about-sexism-in-video-game-industry/|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=[[TIME magazine]]|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=Luke|title=Here's a Devastating Account of the Crap Women in the Games Business Have to Deal With.

Regarding elements of game design, areas such as gameplay, mechanics, and similar features have been described as gender neutral, however presentational aspects of games have been identified as strongly gender-linked. Specifically, gaming is often seen as fantasy and escapism in which empathy and identification with the character is much more easily achieved if the character shares the same gender as the player.&lt;ref name=hex&gt;[[Stephanie Bendixsen|Bendixsen, Stephanie 'Hex']].

The concept that [[video games as art|video games are a form of art]] is one that has begun to gain force in the later half of the 2000s with the U.S. [[National Endowment for the Arts]] recognizing games as a form of art in May 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/109835-Games-Now-Legally-Considered-an-Art-Form-in-the-USA | title= Games Now Legally Considered an Art Form (in the USA) | first = John | last = Funk | date = 2011-05-06 | accessdate = 2011-05-06 | publisher = [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example. In viewing video games as [[cultural artifact]]s and the industry as a cultural industry, the disenfranchisement of women from the medium is regarded as negatively impacting the female voice in the industry and the woman's capacity to take part in the cultural dialogue that gaming inspires.&lt;ref name=spark&gt;Young, Nora &amp; Misener, Dan.

In addressing the future of the medium, many researchers have argued for the improvement of the gaming industry to appeal to a more general gender-neutral audience and others have suggested that the appeal should be directed to women in particular.&lt;ref name=hex /&gt;&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rosen, Jill|title=The gender divide: video-gaming has been largely a man's- or boy's- world, but with games by and for women, that's starting to change|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=September 2008|location=Maryland|page=C1|type=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest attempts to broaden the market to include women could be seen in [[Sega]]'s&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; use of the increased number of female protagonists in fighting games.&lt;ref name=nzegwu /&gt; Other examples of this include games like ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'', ''[[Remember Me (video game)|Remember Me]]'', and ''[[the Last of Us]]'', which include a female option for the main character.&lt;ref name="Dewitt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewitt|first=James|title=Lara Croft and the Future of Women in Videogames|url=http://www.thunderboltgames.com/opinion/lara-croft-and-the-future-of-women-in-videogames|publisher=Thunderboltgames.com|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to use strong female characters in important roles, however, is often met with skepticism by marketers concerned with sales.&lt;ref name="Dring"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dring|first=Christopher|title="Women are the future of gaming" - how Tomb Raider and co have put females back on the agenda|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/women-are-the-future-of-gaming/0111714|publisher=Mcvuk.com|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examination of IGN's [[Big Games]] at [[E3 2012]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/e3/Big_Games_at_E3_2012|title=Big Games at E3 2012 - E3 - Electronics Entertainment Expo Wiki Guide - IGN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Big Games]] at [[E3 2013]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/e3/Big_Games_at_E3_2013|title=Big Games at E3 2013 - E3 - Electronics Entertainment Expo Wiki Guide - IGN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows growth of the female protagonist in video games, rising 4% from 2012 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, Kyle.
