The '''Aarne–Thompson classification systems''' are indices used to classify [[Folklore|folktales]]: the [[Antti Aarne|Aarne]]–[[Stith Thompson|Thompson]] Motif-Index (catalogued by alphabetical letters followed by numerals), the Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index (cataloged by AT or AaTh numbers), and the '''Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification system''' (developed in 2004 and cataloged by ATU numbers). 

They are named after their authors, [[Antti Aarne]], [[Stith Thompson]], and [[Hans-Jörg Uther]].

The indices are used in [[folkloristics]] to organize, classify, and analyze [[folklore]] narratives and are essential tools for folklorists, as [[Alan Dundes]] explained in 1997 about the first two indices, "the identification of folk narratives through [[Motif (folkloristics)|motif]] and/or tale type numbers has become an international ''[[sine qua non]]'' among bona fide folklorists".&lt;ref name="dundes"&gt;Dundes, Alan (1997) "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3814885 The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique]". ''Journal of Folklore Research'' Vol. 34, No. 3, pp. 195–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizing folktale types==
The Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index divides tales into sections with an AT number for each entry. The names given are typical, but usage varies; the same tale type number may be referred to by its central motif or by one of the variant folktales of that type, which can also vary, especially when used in different countries and cultures. The tale type does not have to be accurate for every folktale. For example, ''The Cat as Helper'' (545B) also includes tales where a fox helps the hero. Closely related folktales are often grouped within a type. For example, tale types 400–424 all feature brides or wives as the primary protagonist, for instance ''The Quest for a Lost Bride'' (400) or the ''Animal Bride'' (402). Subtypes within a tale type are designated by the addition of a letter to the AT number, for instance: the ''Persecuted Heroine'' (510) has subtypes 510A, ''[[Cinderella]]'', and 510B, ''[[Catskin]]'' {{crossref|printworthy=y|1=(see other examples of tale types in the [[#Online resources and examples of tale types|online resource links]] at the end of this article)}}.

[[Antti Aarne]] was a student of [[Julius Krohn]] and his son [[Kaarle Krohn]]. Aarne developed their [[historic-geographic method]] of comparative folkloristics, and developed the initial version of what became the Aarne–Thompson tale type index for [[Morphology (folkloristics)|classifying folktales]], first published in 1910.

The American folklorist [[Stith Thompson]] translated Aarne's [[motif (folkloristics)|motif-based]] classification system in 1928, enlarging its scope. With Thompson's second revisions to Aarne's catalogue in 1961, he created the "AT number system" (also referred to as "AaTh system"), which is often used today, more commonly in its updated "ATU number" form. According to [[D. L. Ashliman]], "The Aarne–Thompson system catalogues some 2500 basic plots from which, for countless generations, European and Near Eastern storytellers have built their tales".&lt;ref name=ashliman&gt;[[D. L. Ashliman|Ashliman, D. L.]] 1987. ''A Guide to Folktales in the English Language: Based on the Aarne–Thompson Classification System.'' New York, Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AT-number system was updated and expanded in 2004 with the publication of ''The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography'' by Hans-Jörg Uther. Uther noted that many of the earlier descriptions were cursory and often imprecise, that many "irregular types" are in fact old and widespread, and that "emphasis on oral tradition" often obscured "older, written versions of the tale types".&lt;ref name="uther"/&gt; To remedy these shortcomings Uther developed the '''Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification''' (ATU) system&lt;ref&gt;''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales'', Donald Haase, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; and included more tales from eastern and southern Europe as well as "smaller narrative forms" in this expanded listing.&lt;ref name="uther"/&gt;

==Organising motifs==
{{main|Motif-Index of Folk-Literature}}
The Aarne–Thompson ''[[Motif-Index of Folk-Literature]]'' organizes thousands of motifs into a similar system. Entries are first organized by an umbrella topic (for example, category S is "Unnatural Cruelty"). Entries are then divided into more specific subcategories. For example, entry S50 "Cruel relatives-in-law", under which is the more specific entry S51.1 "Cruel mother-in-law plans death of daughter-in-law".

==Critical response==
In his essay "The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique", Alan Dundes explains that the Aarne–Thompson indexes are some of the "most valuable tools in the professional folklorist's arsenal of aids for analysis".&lt;ref name=dundes/&gt;

The tale type index was criticized by [[Vladimir Propp]] of the [[Russian Formalism|Formalist]] school of the 1920s for ignoring the {{em|functions}} of the [[Motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] by which they are classified. Furthermore, Propp contended that using a "macro-level" analysis means that the stories that share [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] might not be classified together, while stories with wide divergences may be grouped under one tale type because the index must select some features as salient.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folktale''. Similarly, [[Alan Dundes]] points out that "Aarne’s mistake was not classifying tales on the basis of narrative plot rather than [on characters]" because "the same tale can be told with either animal or human characters" (197). "Introduction." Theory and History of Folklore. Ed. Anatoly Liberman. University of Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press, 1984. pg ix&lt;/ref&gt;  He also observed that while the distinction between animal tales and tales of the fantastic was basically correct—no one would classify [[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]] an animal tale because of the wolf—it did raise questions because animal tales often contained fantastic elements, and tales of the fantastic often contained animals; indeed a tale could shift categories if a peasant deceived a bear rather than a devil.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, ''Morphology of the Folktale'', p. 5 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing the motivation for his work,&lt;ref name="uther"&gt;{{cite web |first=Hans-Jörg |last=Uther |url=http://www.folklorefellows.fi/?page_id=915 |title=Classifying folktales: The Third Revision of the Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index (FFC 184) |publisher=folklorefellow.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uther presents several criticisms of the original index. He points out that Thompson's focus on oral tradition sometimes neglects older versions of stories, even when written records exist, that the distribution of stories is uneven (with Eastern and Southern European as well as many other regions' folktale types being under-represented), and that some included folktale types have dubious importance. Similarly, Thompson had noted that the tale type index might well be called ''The Types of the Folk-Tales of Europe, West Asia, and the Lands Settled by these Peoples''.&lt;ref name="uther"/&gt; However, Alan Dundes notes that in spite of the flaws of tale type indexes (e.&amp;nbsp;g., typos, redundancies, censorship, etc.; p.&amp;nbsp;198),&lt;ref name="dundes" /&gt; "they represent the keystones for the comparative method in [[folkloristics]], a method which despite postmodern naysayers ... continues to be the hallmark of international folkloristics" (p.&amp;nbsp;200).&lt;ref name="dundes" /&gt;

==Use in folkloristics==

A [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] study, published by [[folklorist]] Sara Graça da Silva and [[anthropologist]] Jamshid J. Tehrani in 2016, tried to evaluate the time of emergence for the "Tales of Magic" (ATU 300–ATU 749), based on a [[phylogenetic]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graça da Silva |first=Sara |last2=Tehrani  |first2=Jamshid J. |date=January 2016 |title=Comparative phylogenetic analyses uncover the ancient roots of Indo-European folktales |url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/1/150645#F4 |journal=Royal Society Open Science |publisher=The Royal Society |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1098/rsos.150645 |access-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found four of them to belong to the [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) stratum of magic tales, namely:

* ATU 328 ''The Boy Steals Ogre's Treasure'',
* ATU 330 ''[[The Smith and the Devil]]'' (= [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|KHM]] 81a),
* ATU 402 ''The Animal Bride'' (= KHM [[:de:Die drei Federn|63]] and [[:de:Der arme Müllerbursch und das Kätzchen|106]]), and
* ATU 554 ''The Grateful Animals'' (= ''[[The White Snake]]'', KHM 17, and ''[[The Queen Bee]]'', KHM 62).

Ten more magic tales were found to be current throughout the Western branch of the Indo-European languages, comprising the main European language families derived from PIE (i.&amp;nbsp;e. [[Balto-Slavic]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Italo-Celtic]]):

* ATU 311 ''Rescue by Sister'' (= ''[[Fitcher's Bird]]'', KHM 46),
* ATU 332 ''[[Godfather Death]]'' (= KHM 44),
* ATU 425&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'',
* ATU 470 ''Friends in Life and Death'',
* ATU 500 ''The Name of the Supernatural Helper'' (= ''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]'', KHM 55),
* ATU 505 ''The Grateful Dead'',
* ATU 531 ''The Clever Horse'' (= ''[[Ferdinand the Faithful and Ferdinand the Unfaithful]]'', KHM 126),
* ATU 592 ''The Dance among Thorns'' (= ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Der Jude im Dorn|Der Jude im Dorn]]}}'', KHM 110 is an example of this type of tale, and one of many racist and antisemitic folk tales that have been recorded),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maarten Janssen |url=http://www.mftd.org/index.php?action=atu&amp;act=select&amp;atu=592 |title=Multilingual Folk Tale Database |publisher=Mftd.org |date= |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**The original version of the "Dance Among the Thorns" tale-type comes from 15th century Europe, and features a monk who was forced to dance in a thorn bush, by a boy with a magic flute or fiddle. It reflected the anticlerical sentiment of many folk tales at the time, and implies that the monk deserves this punishment. An American version of this tale, told to folklorist  Marie Campbell in 1958 in Kentucky, included this apology from the informant: "Seems like all the tales about Jews gives the Jews a bad name — greedy, grabbing for cash money, cheating their work hands out of their wages — I don't know what all. I never did know a Jew, never even met up with one." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9KEk9wQPjkC&amp;pg=PA786&amp;lpg=PA786&amp;dq=ATU+592&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TdDjHA6OZI&amp;sig=BPMc1SNTkK7wUuyJsQCm4lAS2mQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCzfe_4IXcAhVKzVMKHR5EBLMQ6AEIPzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=ATU%20592&amp;f=false |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales [3 Volumes&amp;#93; - Donald Haase - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-12-30 |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ATU 650&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; ''Strong John'' (= ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Der starke Hans|Der starke Hans]]}}'', KHM 166), and
* ATU 675 ''The Lazy Boy''.

'''Airline timetables''' are printed pamphlets or folders that many [[airlines]] have traditionally used to inform passengers of several different things, such as schedules, fleet, security, in-flight entertainment, food menus, baggage weight restrictions, and contact information.

Airline timetables used to be printed, multi-page pamphlets available at airport counters, or upon request by phone or mail. On January 16, 1928, [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] published one of their first timetables. It read ''The air-way to [[Havana]], Pan American Airways, [[Pershing Square Building]], New York''.

Many airline timetables had colorful covers. The timetables of very small airlines, such as [[Scenic Airways]], consisted of one sheet of paper, with their hub's flight time information on the front, and the return times on the back. 
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:CX onlinetimetable.jpg|right|230px|thumb|Online timetable of [[Cathay Pacific]] Airways.Data shown on the picture are flights from [[Hong Kong International Airport]] to its secondary hub, [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport]] of [[Taipei]]{{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

In recent years, most airlines have stopped production of printed timetables, in order to cut costs and reduce the delay between a change of schedule and a new timetable being in the hands of the public. As a consequence, most airlines now post their timetables only [[Internet|online]] (the larger airlines often offering a stand-alone application, while others provide just a downloadable document such as a [[PDF]]), and the value of many printed airline timetable has risen among collectors.

'''''Among Gnomes and Trolls''''' ({{Lang-sv|Bland [[tomte|tomtar]] och [[troll]]}}), is a popular [[Sweden|Swedish]] folklore and fairy tales annual and children's fairy tale anthology published since 1907. One of the most noted of the early illustrators is artist [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]].

The first four volumes were illustrated by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]. Volume 5 (1911) was illustrated by Norwegian illustrator Louis Moe, after which Bauer resumed illustrating from 1912 to 1915 (volumes 6-9). 1916 had no issue, but the series continues in 1917, illustrated by Aina Masolle and Gustaf Tengren, marking the series' first woman illustrator. From 1918 to 1926 Gustaf Tenggren was the sole illustrator. Between 1927 and 1980, [[Einar Norelius]] was the chief illustrator. Among the writers were authors such as [[Hjalmar Bergman]], [[Helena Nyblom]], [[Margareta Ekström]], [[Gösta Knutsson]] and [[Edith Unnerstad]].&lt;ref name=Museum /&gt;

Several books with extracts from the original volumes illustrated by John Bauer have been published. The first one was published in 1931 to raise money for a memorial honouring Bauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bauer|first=John|title=John Bauers bästa: ett urval sagor ur Bland tomtar och troll åren 1907–1915|date=1931|publisher=Åhlén &amp; Åkerlund|location=Stockholm|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/john-bauers-basta-ett-urval-sagor-ur-bland-tomtar-och-troll-aren-1907-1915/oclc/492479986|accessdate=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most noted pictures from "Among gnomes and trolls" by John Bauer 1913 is ''Ännu sitter Tuvstarr kvar och ser ner i vattnet'' ("Still, Tuvstarr sits and gazes down into the water").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Agrenius|first=Helen|date=1996|title=Om konstnären John Bauer och hans värld|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/7751744|language=Swedish|location=Jönköping|publisher=Jönköpings läns museum|page=45|isbn=91-85692-29-8|accessdate=July 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10663">'''Andreas Constantine Papadakis''' FLS (17 June 1938 – 10 June 2008) was a Cypriot-born British academic, entrepreneur and leading figure in the field of [[Publishing|architectural publishing]]. He opened the Academy Bookshop in [[Holland Street, Kensington|Holland Street]], Kensington in 1964 and moved into publishing as Academy Editions in 1968. From then until 1990, when he sold the company to VCH Germany (now part of [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|John Wiley]]) he published more than a thousand titles mainly on art, architecture and the decorative arts.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;Anon. (2008) Andreas Papadakis: Publisher; Times Online Obituary. ''Times Online'', 30 Jul. [internet] Available at: http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4424818.ece &lt;!--accessed 30 April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to publish (in USA - [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]] 'and latter [[St. Martin's Press]]) many international architects in the  'Architectural Monographs No...' series,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_adv_b/?search-alias=stripbooks&amp;unfiltered=1&amp;field-keywords=&amp;field-author=&amp;field-title=Architectural+Monographs+No&amp;field-isbn=&amp;field-publisher=&amp;node=&amp;url=&amp;field-feature_browse-bin=&amp;field-binding_browse-bin=&amp;field-subject=&amp;field-language=&amp;field-dateop=&amp;field-datemod=&amp;field-dateyear=&amp;sort=price&amp;Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.x=26&amp;Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.y=16 Architectural Monographs No...]&lt;/ref&gt; which included [[Alvar Aalto]] (No 4), [[Michael Graves]] (No 5), [[Edwin Lutyens]] (No 6), [[John Soane]] (No 8), [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]] (No 9), [[Richard Rogers]] (No 10), [[Mies van der Rohe]] (No 11), [[Hassan Fathy]] (No 13), [[Tadao Ando]] (No 14), [[Daniel Libeskind]] (No 16), etc.; and Victor Arwas’s ''Art Deco'', first published in 1980 remains the standard work on the subject.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Anon. (2008) Andreas Papadakis, ''Telegraph.co.uk'', 18 Aug. [internet] Available at: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2581290/Andreas-Papadakis.html &lt;!--accessed 30 April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Papadakis was born in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]] on 17 June 1938 and relocated to London in 1956. He obtained a DIC from [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] and a PhD from [[Brunel University]]. In 1964 he bought a house in Holland Street, [[Kensington]] without realising that the shop (then a dry cleaners) on the ground floor could not be used for residential purposes.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; He decided to open a bookshop. The Academy Bookshop began as a general bookshop. His first publications were finely bound limited editions of other publishers’ books but he soon decided that he would prefer to make his own and began in 1967 with a large format paperback of [[Aubrey Beardsley]]’s prints, an ideal title to attract the customers of [[Biba]], who had recently opened her shop just round the corner in Kensington Church Street. The Beardsley book was still in print when Academy was sold in 1990.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

==Academy Editions &amp; ''Architectural Design''==
In 1971 Papadakis expanded his fast-growing business with the acquisition of the Tiranti publishing company and the London Art Bookshop. He moved the shop to No. 8 Holland Street, just opposite the Academy Bookshop and set about expanding the combined Academy/Tiranti list. Early publications included Jim Burns’s ''Arthropods'', Roger Bilcliffe’s ''Charles Rennie Mackintosh'', [[Bernard Rudofsky|Rudofsky]]’s [[Architecture Without Architects|''Architecture without Architects'']], [[Reyner Banham]]’s ''Design by Choice'', ''Alphonse Mucha, Complete Graphic Works'', and [[Rudolf Wittkower|Wittkower]]’s ''Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism''.

In 1975 Papadakis bought the financially troubled ''Architectural Design'' magazine. This created some controversy because of his non-architectural background and his unwillingness to give his unconditional support to one particular architectural style.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bd"&gt;Latham, I. (1988) Anniversaries: Edited Highlights. ''Building Design'', 30 Sep. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suntimes"&gt;Pearman, H. (1993) Function Follows Farm. ''The Sunday Times'', 25 Jul. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy increased with the publication of [[Charles Jencks]]’s ''The Language of Post-Modern Architecture'' in 1977, which was in its sixth edition by the time he sold Academy in 1990.

Both ''Architectural Design'' and Academy Editions continued to publish [[Postmodern architecture|Post-Modern]], [[Classical architecture|Classical]] and [[Deconstructivism|Deconstructivist]] projects throughout the 1980s while Papadakis himself actively fostered the pluralist debate through seminars, conferences and exhibitions at the [[University of Westminster|Polytechnic of Central London]], the [[Architectural Association]], the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]], the [[German Architecture Museum]] in [[Frankfurt]], and through his Academy Forums at the [[Tate|Tate Gallery]] and the [[Royal Academy|Royal Academy of Arts]], where he also founded the annual Architecture Lecture.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bd"/&gt;

In 1990, Papadakis sold what was by now the Academy Group Ltd. with ''Architectural Design'' and the journals he had founded: ''Architectural Monographs'', ''Art and Design'' and the ''Journal of Philosophy and the Visual Arts''. He left the group at the end of 1992 and was banned by a non-competition clause from publishing for five years.&lt;ref name="bdd"&gt;Anon. (1993) Rise and Fall of PoMo King. ''Building Design'', 15 Jan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Papadakis Publisher and Restoration Projects==
In 1997, Papadakis founded a new publishing house, Papadakis Publisher, with his daughter Alexandra. In addition to books on architecture and the decorative arts the company broadened its scope to include books on natural science, including the acclaimed&lt;ref name="seedscience"&gt;Thompson, K. (2007) Book Review: Seeds, Time Capsules of Life. ''Seed Science Research'' 17, p. 71 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;Anon.

(2008) Fruit: Edible, Inedible, Incredible.

[[File:Church Island House in the Thames, Staines.jpg|thumb|Church Island House in the Thames]]

As Papadakis’s business ventures were increasingly successful, he purchased several properties for restoration, including the medieval Kilbees Farm in [[Winkfield|Winkfield, Berkshire]] and Dauntsey Park House in [[Wiltshire]], although the latter project ended in 2005 when planning permission was refused.&lt;ref name="suntimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraphdp"&gt;Aslet, C.

In 1987 Papadakis bought Church Island in the Thames and commissioned Dr. [[Basil Al Bayati]], an architect whose books 'Architect'&lt;ref name=architect&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; he had published, to design a house for him.
“For his luxury mansion on his Greek-island-in-the-Thames, the great man chose not Michael Graves, one of the deconstructivists or even CZWG, but pragmatic classicist Basil Al Bayati, whom he instructed to design a country house in the English turn-of-the-century manner.”&lt;ref name="secondcoming"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan of the house is based on multiple units of structural geometrical forms and utilises extensive brickwork in a postmodern, art &amp; craft style.  It was “designed in a vernacular manner, using building materials similar to those traditionally used in the area.”

In 1988, Church Island House was exhibited at the [[German Architecture Museum]] in [[Frankfurt]] in an exhibition titled The Architecture of Pluralism that included work by [[James Gowan]], [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]], [[Charles Jencks]] and some twenty other internationally recognised architects.

In 2007 he purchased [[Monkey Island, Bray|Monkey Island Hotel]] in [[Bray, Berkshire]] but died a few months afterwards.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

The '''Armenhoef''' is a monumental farm on the Oirschotseweg 117 in the [[North Brabant]]ian town [[Best, Netherlands|Best]] in the [[Netherlands]].

The Armenhoef is the oldest, still in use farm of North Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isgeschiedenis.nl/nieuws/de-oudste-boerderij-van-west-europa/|title=De oudste boerderij van West-Europa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By archaeological building research in 2009 the timber frame of the barn was determined to date back to 1263.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meet-tekenwerk.nl/oudste-boerderij-van-nederland-wordt-volledig-3d-ingescand|title=Oudste boerderij van Nederland wordt volledig 3d ingescand|work=Meet-Tekenwerk.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meet-tekenwerk.nl/3d-laserscannen-en-orthofotos-oudste-boerderij/|title=3d laserscannen en orthofoto's oudste boerderij - Meet-Tekenwerk.nl - 3D meetoplossingen - Laser scanning - Scan to BIM|work=Meet-Tekenwerk.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.volkskrant.nl/dossier-archief/armenhoef-blijkt-een-rijke-vondst~a3453471&lt;/ref&gt; The modern farmhouse itself dates from a much later period and was built in 1640 at the earliest, but probably around 1680.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openmonumentendag.nl/monument/best-de-armenhoef/|title=De Armenhoef|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm is a monument and was in urgent need of restoration. The government was prepared to provide a contribution to this restoration. Also, the building has been recognized as a monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemeentebest.nl/data/downloadables/2/8/6/6/aanwijzing-beschermd-rijksmonument-oirschotseweg-117.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916034046/http://www.gemeentebest.nl/data/downloadables/2/8/6/6/aanwijzing-beschermd-rijksmonument-oirschotseweg-117.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This deviates from state policy not to designate buildings dating from the period before 1940 as a national monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bouwwereld.nl/nieuws/oudste-boerderij-van-nederland-wordt-rijksmonument/|title=Oudste boerderij wordt rijksmonument|work=Bouwwereld.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemeentebest.nl/sport-cultuur-en-recreatie/monumenten/68/de-armenhoef-oirschotseweg-117.html%20De%20Armenhoef,%20Oirschotseweg%20117|title=Monumenten|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the farm has to do with the former function. Armenhoef means Poor People Farm. The proceeds of this then-largest farm in Best were used for poor aid. The municipality has recognized the building as a municipal monument because of its cultural, historical, architectural and scenic value. Elements such as the age, the integrity of the farm and the function for poor relief played a role. To the state, the age of the farm and the rare building characteristics, such as the barn overhang above the north facade, was decisive for admission to the qualification procedure as a national monument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultureelerfgoed.nl/actueel/nieuws/oudste-boerderij-van-nederland-wordt-rijksmonument Oudste boerderij van Nederland wordt rijksmonument] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908213155/http://www.cultureelerfgoed.nl/actueel/nieuws/oudste-boerderij-van-nederland-wordt-rijksmonument |date=September 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''As I Opened Fire''''' (sometimes '''''As I Opened Fire...''''') is a 1964 oil and [[Magna (paint)|magna]] on canvas painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. The work is hosted at the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]]. The source of the subject matter is [[Jerry Grandenetti]]'s panels from "Wingmate of Doom," in ''All American Men of War'', no. 90 (March–April 1962), [[DC Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waldman|1993|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detail==
[[File:As I Opened Fire source cropped.jpg|thumb|left|The source for ''As I Opened Fire'' was ''All American Men of War''#90 (b) (March–April 1962).]]
Measuring 170&amp;nbsp;cm × 430&amp;nbsp;cm (68 in × 168 in), ''As I Opened Fire'' is a [[triptych]] with verbal and temporal continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coplans|1972|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, it was regarded as "...perhaps Lichtenstein's most ambitious exercise in strangely uniting, visually (as well as figuratively) warring elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coplans|1972|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depicting a short few seconds during an aircraft battle, the painting is based on three panels of the original narrative which Lichtenstein has altered to improve its formal coherence.&lt;ref name="Waldman 105"&gt;{{cite book|author=Waldman|page=105|title=Roy Lichtenstein|chapter=War Comics, 1962–64|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This piece represents his affinity towards "...highly emotional content, yet detached impersonal handling..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art|author=Lippard, Lucy R.|publisher=[[Praeger Publishers]]|year=1970|edition=third printing|isbn=|page=94|chapter=New York Pop|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''As I Opened Fire'' exhibits Lichtenstein's "formal imagination". We see successive tighter views of the gun muzzles in action accompanied by an [[onomatopoeia]], which provides cinematic flow despite the varying skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Pop Art|author=Alloway, Lawrence|year=1974|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc.]]|isbn=0-02-627700-X|page=78|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''As I Opened Fire'' is regarded as a "very uncompromising military triptych".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Illustrated History of Pop Art|author=Pierre, José|publisher=Eyre Methuen|isbn=0-413-38370-9|page=94|year=1977|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roy Lichtenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Lichtenstein in 1967]]
Lichtenstein desired his paintings to look as mechanical as possible despite being painted by hand. He chose as his subjects teen and action [[comics]] because he valued the impersonal quality of their artwork, the products of teams of illustrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|author=Hendrickson, Janis|publisher=[[Benedikt Taschen]]|year=1993|isbn=3-8228-9633-0|page=25|chapter=The Pictures That Lichtenstein made Famous, or The Pictures that Made Lichtenstein Famous|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similarities to the original source are extensive: narrative text and general message of the gunfire. However, he made the joint image more coherent by repositioning the second and third panels for better alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Reflections|author=Waldman, Diane|publisher=Electa|year=1999|isbn=88-435-7287-3|pages=21–23|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with ''[[Whaam!]]'' (the other of his monumental war paintings), this is regarded as the culmination of the dramatic war-comic works of Lichtenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Waldman|year=1993|title=Roy Lichtenstein|page=95|chapter=War Comics, 1962–64|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with  ''Whaam!'', ''As I Opened Fire'' is more abstract.&lt;ref name="Waldman 105"/&gt; Lichtenstein commented on his war imagery: "A minor purpose of my war paintings is to put military aggressiveness in an absurd light. My personal opinion is that much of our foreign policy has been unbelievably terrifying, but this is not what my work is about and I don't want to capitalize on this popular position. My work is more about our American definition of images and visual communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|author=Hendrickson, Janis|publisher=[[Benedikt Taschen]]|year=1993|isbn=3-8228-9633-0|page=29|chapter=The Pictures That Lichtenstein made Famous, or The Pictures that Made Lichtenstein Famous|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein's alterations from the original source change the uniform perspective of the images, causing it to flow "like a series of movie clips".&lt;ref name="Waldman 105"/&gt;

The work is considered relatively lacking in unity of its narrative progression. The narrative of the first frame seems unrelated to its graphics and the other frames are equally confusing: It is not clear which frames represent an enemy or an ally, or whether the speaker is the enemy, an ally or the viewer. In general the work is misleading in "spatial, temporal and psychological viewpoint".&lt;ref name=PoR&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lFxCRvrm9zAC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=Whaam!+Lichtenstein&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ee2-UZnqO5Pk9gShoIDYAg&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Whaam!%20Lichtenstein&amp;f=false|title=Pictures of Romance: Form against Context in Painting and Literature|accessdate=June 17, 2013|year=1987|isbn=0226772292|pages=164–5|author=Steiner, Wendy|publisher=[[University Of Chicago Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Authenticity''' is a concept in [[psychology]] (in particular [[Existential psychotherapy|existential psychiatry]]) as well as [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]] and [[aesthetics]] (in regard to various arts and musical genres). In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which an individual's actions are congruent with their beliefs and desires, despite external pressures; the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces, pressures, and influences which are very different from, and other than, itself. A lack of authenticity is considered in existentialism to be ''[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authenticity/ Authenticity (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The call of authenticity resonates with the famous instruction by the [[Pythia|Oracle of Delphi]], “[[Know thyself]].” But authenticity extends this message: "Don’t merely know thyself – be thyself."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself!

Views of authenticity in cultural activities vary widely. For instance, the philosophers [[Jean Paul Sartre]] and [[Theodor Adorno]] had opposing views regarding jazz, with Sartre considering it authentic and Adorno inauthentic. The concept of authenticity is often aired in  musical subcultures, such as [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], where a purported lack of authenticity is commonly labeled with the epithet "[[poseur]]".&lt;ref name="indiecult2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiecult.com/2006-04/television-personalities-my-dark-places |title=Homeward Bound.

==Theories==

===Existentialism===
One of the greatest problems facing such abstract approaches is that the drives people call the "needs of one's inner being" are diffuse, subjective, and often culture-bound. For this reason among others, authenticity is often "at the limits" of language; it is described as the negative space around inauthenticity, with reference to examples of inauthentic living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Golomb | first = Jacob | title = In Search of Authenticity | publisher = Routledge | year = 1995 | location = London and New York | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-415-11946-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre's novels are perhaps the easiest access to this mode of describing authenticity: they often contain characters and [[antihero]]es who base their actions on external pressures—the pressure to appear to be a certain kind of person, the pressure to adopt a particular mode of living, the pressure to ignore one's own moral and aesthetic objections in order to have a more comfortable existence. His work also includes characters who do not understand their own reasons for acting, or who ignore crucial facts about their own lives in order to avoid uncomfortable truths; this connects his work with the philosophical tradition.

Sartre is concerned also with the "[[vertiginous]]" experience of absolute freedom. In Sartre's view, this experience, necessary for the state of authenticity, can be so unpleasant that it leads people to inauthentic ways of living. Typically, authenticity is seen as a very general concept, not attached to any particular political or aesthetic ideology. This is a necessary aspect of authenticity: because it concerns a person's ''relation'' with the world, it cannot be arrived at by simply repeating a set of actions or taking up a set of positions. In this manner, authenticity is connected with creativity: the impetus to action must arise from the person in question, and not be externally imposed. Heidegger takes this notion to the extreme, by speaking in very abstract terms about modes of living (his terminology was adopted and simplified by Sartre in his philosophical works). Kierkegaard's work (e.g. "Panegyric Upon Abraham" from ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'') often focuses on biblical stories which are not directly imitable. Sartre, as has been noted above, focused on inauthentic existence as a way to avoid the paradoxical problem of appearing to provide prescriptions for a mode of living that rejects external dictation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2= Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authenticity, according to Kierkegaard, is reliant on an individual finding authentic faith and becoming true to oneself. Kierkegaard develops the idea that news media and the bourgeois church-Christianity present challenges for an individual in society trying to live authentically. Kierkegaard thus sees “both the media and the church as intervening agencies, blocking people’s way to true experiences, authenticity, and God. “&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Kristoffer Holt, “Authentic Journalism? A Critical Discussion about Existential Authenticity in Journalism Ethics,” Journal of Mass Media Ethics 27 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction lies with the idea that mass-culture creates a loss of individual significance, which he refers to as “levelling.” Kierkegaard views the media as supporting a society that does not form its own opinions but utilizes the opinions constructed by the news. Similarly, he interprets religion as a tradition that is passively accepted by individuals, without the inclusion of authentic thought. Kierkegaard believes that authentic faith can be achieved by “facing reality, making a choice and then passionately sticking with it.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The goal of Kierkegaard's existentialist philosophy is to show that, in order to achieve authenticity, one must face reality and form his own opinions of existence. So as not to be discouraged by levelling, Kierkegaard suggests, “One must make an active choice to surrender to something that goes beyond comprehension, a leap of faith into the religious.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Even if one does not want to put forth the effort of developing his own views, he must do so in the quest for authentic faith.

Nietzsche's view of authenticity is an atheist interpretation of Kierkegaard. He rejects the role of religion in finding authenticity because he believes in finding truth without the use of virtues. Nietzsche believes of the authentic man as the following: Someone who elevates himself over others in order to transcend the limits of conventional morality in an attempt to decide for oneself about [[good and evil]], without regard for the virtues “on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;Nietzsche, F.W., &amp; Zimmern, H. (1997). Beyond good and evil: Prelude to a philosophy of the future. Mineola, NY: Dover.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche rejects the idea of religious virtues due to the lack of questioning by the individual. One must avoid what he calls “herding animal morality,”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; if he is to find authenticity. To “stand alone” and avoid religiously constructed principles, it is essential to be “strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvaluate and invert ‘eternal valuations.’”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; One must be a free thinker and theorize views outside of their predilections. The commonality of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche’s existential philosophies is “the responsibilities they place on the individual to take active part in the shaping of one’s beliefs and then to be willing to act on that belief.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; For Nietzsche, the secular mentality is a form of weakness and, for authenticity to be achieved, one must truly transcend conventional morality.

According to Abulof, authenticity's calling – being true to oneself – deceivingly conceals the deep chasms between two divergent interpretations of the "self": essentialist and existentialist. Essentialist authenticity demands we find and follow our preordained destiny, our inborn core. Conversely, existentialist authenticity prescribes “determine your destiny!” urging people to become aware of their freedom to choose their own path, which may, but need not, join that of others. While essentialists search for signs of self-betrayals, existentialists defiantly ask, “How am I not myself?” and answer: only when I forget my freedom, and surrender to “bad faith.” Otherwise, my choices – whatever they might be – constitute me.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself! How Am I Not myself?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|journal=Society|language=en|volume=54|issue=6|pages=530–532|doi=10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|issn=0147-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existential journalism====
[[List of existentialists|Existential philosophers]] like [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Heidegger]] investigate the existential-ontological significance of societally constructed norms to decipher authenticity. For an existential journalist, this aversion to, and turning away from, an unquestioning acceptance of norms contributes to the production of an authentic work. [[J. C. Merrill|Merrill]] believes that authentic journalism can exist if the journalist is true to one's self and rejects conformism. There are traditions that exist in media and news outlets that prevent journalists from achieving authenticity. Like Kierkegaard's view of media and church, Merrill believes that journalists are “gladly sacrificing individual authenticity to adapt nicely to the highly regimented, [[depersonalized]] corporate structure.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"&gt;Merril, J.C. (1995). Existential Journalism (rev. ed.) Ames, IA: Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists are restricted by “institutional red tape” and, thus, cannot achieve authenticity. It is beneficial for journalists to adhere to the “red tape” because their work will be published.

Actively shaping one's own belief and then acting upon that belief is a laborious task. A journalist that hesitates in writing a story because it is not within the norm is unable to achieve authenticity because of the notion that following the norm is more valuable than being authentic. The contention is, however, that “individual freedom and courage to act is more valuable than collective adherence to journalistic codes of conduct.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; As journalists make conscious decisions to write authentically, they are able to contribute more value in their work. The consequence of authentic writing is positive and ensures that the journalist, according to Merrill, “grows, matures, creates himself, and projects himself into the future.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt;

====Criticisms====
Philosopher [[Jacob Golomb]] argues that the existentialist notion of authenticity is incompatible with a morality that values all persons.&lt;ref&gt;Golomb, Jacob (1995). ''In Search of Authenticity: From Kierkegaard to Camus''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erich Fromm===
A very different definition of authenticity was proposed by [[Erich Fromm]]&lt;ref&gt;Fromm. E., Escape from Freedom, Farrar &amp; Rinehart 1941 (also published as "Fear of Freedom" Routledge UK 1942)&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-1900s. He considered behavior of any kind, even that wholly in accord with societal mores, to be authentic if it results from personal understanding and approval of its drives and origins, rather than merely from conformity with the received wisdom of the society.  Thus a Frommean authentic may behave consistently in a manner that accords with cultural norms, for the reason that those norms appear on consideration to be appropriate, rather than simply in the interest of conforming with current norms. Fromm thus considers authenticity to be a positive outcome of enlightened and informed motivation rather than a negative outcome of rejection of the expectations of others. He described the latter condition – the drive primarily to escape external restraints typified by the "absolute freedom" of Sartre – as "the illusion of individuality",&lt;ref&gt;Fromm E., Fear of Freedom, ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the genuine individuality that results from authentic living.

===Other perspectives===
Those who advocate [[Reform movement|social reform]] value the study of authenticity since it can provide a radical manifesto and an overview of the shortcomings of social structures. Michael Kernis and Brian Goldman defined authenticity as "the unimpeded operation of one's true or core self in one's daily enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Karen (May 01, 2008). [http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200804/dare-be-yourself "Dare to be yourself"]. ''Psychology Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While authenticity may be a goal intrinsic to "the good life," it is often a difficult state to actually achieve, due in part to social pressures to live inauthentically and in part to a person's own character. It is also described as a revelatory state, where one perceives oneself, other people, and sometimes even things, in a radically new way. Some writers argue that authenticity also requires self-knowledge, and that it alters a person's relationships with other people. Authenticity also carries with it its own set of moral obligations, which often exist regardless of race, gender and class. The notion of authenticity also fits into [[utopia]]n ideology, which requires authenticity among its citizens to exist, or which claims that such a condition would remove physical and economic barriers to pursuing authenticity.

==History==
Secular and religious notions of authenticity have coexisted for centuries under different guises; perhaps the earliest account of authenticity that remains popular is [[Socrates]]' admonition that "the unexamined life is not worth living". In aesthetics, "[[Authenticity in art|authenticity]]" describes the perception of art as faithful to the artist's self, rather than conforming to external values such as historical tradition, or commercial worth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} A common definition of "authenticity" in [[psychology]] refers to the attempt to live one's life according to the needs of one's inner being, rather than the demands of society or one's early conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, A. M., Linley, P. A., Maltby, J., Baliousis, M., Joseph, S. (2008) [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/Authenticity%20Scale.pdf The authentic personality: "A theoretical and empirical conceptualization, and the development of the Authenticity Scale"]. ''Journal of Counseling Psychology'' '''55''' (3): 385–399. {{doi|10.1037/0022-0167.55.3.385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://psych.athabascau.ca/html/Glossary/demo_glossary.cgi?mode=history&amp;term_id=1196 Authentic life].

The search for authenticity is a hallmark of romantic modernity. Romanticists since the late 18th century prescribed intuition, emotion and a return to nature as a necessary corrective, even an antidote, to Enlightenment's “cold” reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/935280039|title=Creative Imagination.|last=James.|first=Engell,|date=1980|publisher=HUP|isbn=9780674333253|location=Cambridge|oclc=935280039}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, Anglo-American discussions of authenticity often center around the writings of a few key figures associated with [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]], where the term originated; because most of these writers wrote in languages other than English, the process of translating and anthologizing has had a strong impact on the debate. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] might be credited with creating a "canon" of existentialist writers which include [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. For these writers, the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces and influences which are very different from itself; authenticity is one way in which the self acts and changes in response to these pressures.

The call of, and for, authenticity - "be theyself!" - has pervaded modern thought and culture. A [https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=be+yourself&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2018&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cbe%20yourself%3B%2Cc0 Google ngram (1800-2008)] indicates the dramatic rise, since the 1960s, in relative frequency of this modern command: "in books, Hollywood films, commercials, and daily conversations, we advise, even order: be yourself!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cultural activities==
Due to different groups' and individual's different experiences, views of authenticity regarding cultural activities vary widely and often differ between groups and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini (2010). "Semiotic and semantic implications of "authenticity"". ''Psychological Reports'' '''106''' (2): 611–612.&lt;/ref&gt; For Sartre, [[jazz]] music was a representation of freedom; this may have been in part because jazz was associated with [[African American]] culture, and was thus in opposition to Western culture generally, which Sartre considered hopelessly inauthentic. [[Theodor Adorno]], however, another writer and philosopher concerned with the notion of authenticity, despised jazz music because he saw it as a false representation that could give the appearance of authenticity but that was as much bound up in concerns with appearance and audience as many other forms of art. Heidegger in his later life associated authenticity with non-technological modes of existence, seeing technology as distorting a more "authentic" relationship with the natural world.

Some writers on authenticity in the twentieth century considered the predominant [[Norm (social)|cultural norms]] to be inauthentic; not only because they were seen as forced on people, but also because, in themselves, they required people to behave inauthentically towards their own desires, obscuring true reasons for acting. [[Advertising]], in as much as it attempted to give people a reason for doing something that they did not already possess, was a "textbook" example of how Western culture distorted the individual for external reasons. Race relations are seen as another limit on authenticity, as they demand that the self engage with others on the basis of external attributes. An early example of the connection between inauthenticity and capitalism was made by [[Karl Marx]], whose notion of "[[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]" can be linked to the later discourse on the nature of inauthenticity.
[[File:Das musste ja so kommen..!.jpg|thumb|150px|The punk subculture classifies members as "poseurs" if they are deemed to not understand or respect the subculture's values.]]
Individuals concerned with living authentically have often led unusual lives that opposed cultural norms; the rise of the [[counter-culture]] in the 1960s in Europe and America was seen by many as a new opportunity to live an authentic existence. Many, however, have pointed out that [[anti-authoritarianism]] and eccentricity does not necessarily constitute an authentic state of being. The connection of the violation of cultural norms to authenticity, however, is strong and real{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, and continues today: among artists who explicitly violate the conventions of their profession, for example. The connection of inauthenticity to [[capitalism]] is contained in the notion of "[[selling out]]," used to describe an artist whose work has become inauthentic after achieving commercial success and thus becoming to an extent integrated into an inauthentic system.

Australian author [[Helen Demidenko]]'s novel ''The Hand that Signed the Paper'' promoted much debate on the nature of identity, ethnicity, and authenticity in Australian literature. The novel is about a Ukrainian family trying to survive a decade of [[Stalinist purges]] and state-imposed poverty and famine. When the media discovered Helen Dale's identity and legal name, this created debate in Australia's literary community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Susanna|last=Egan|title=The Company She Keeps: Demidenko and the problems of imposture in autobiography|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=October 2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_4_21/ai_n29152127/|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ken|last=Stewart|title=Those infernal pictures: reading Helen Darville, her novel and her critics|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=May 1997|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_n1_v18/ai_n28692326/?tag=content;col1|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of authenticity is often raised in the [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] musical subcultures, in which people or bands are criticized for their purported lack of authenticity by being labeled with the epithet "[[poseur]]".&lt;ref name="indiecult2006"/&gt; "Poseur" is used to refer to a person (or band) who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture. "The code of authenticity, which is central to the [[heavy metal subculture]], is demonstrated in many ways", such as through clothing, the use of an emotional singing voice and having serious themes in the songs.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Deena. ''Heavy Metal:The Music and its Subculture." Da Capo Press, 2009. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In metal, one study of how fans sought out authenticity within the metal scene noted three elements to authenticity: long-term dedication to the scene; knowing key events of metal culture; and making the right choices based on one's authentic inner voice.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Susanna. "I Bang My Head, Therefore I Am: Constructing Individual and Social Authenticity in the Heavy Metal Subculture" in ''Young.'' 21 (1). 2013. p. 95-110&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Black metal]], an [[extreme metal]] genre, sincerity, authenticity and extremity are valued above all else."{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} In the metal and hardcore punk subcultures, a band that began from a working class milieu that later signs to a major record label for a lucrative recording contract may be deemed to have "[[sell out|sold out]]" and lost their authenticity. In addition to the focus on authenticity in "...punk, [[house music|house]], grunge, garage, and hip-hop," ideas of authenticity have seeped into many other genres, including those considered by some to be less "authentic" than the aforementioned.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

[[File:Frans Hogenberg Bildersturm 1566.jpg|thumb|360px|Print of the destruction in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Church of Our Lady in Antwerp]], the "signature event" of the Beeldenstorm, August 20, 1566, by [[Frans Hogenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;analysed in Arnade, 146 (quoted); see also [http://www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/155/index.html Art through time]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''''Beeldenstorm''''' in Dutch, roughly translatable to "statue storm", or '''''Bildersturm''''' in German ("image/statue storm"), also the '''Great Iconoclasm''' or '''Iconoclastic Fury''', is a term used for outbreaks of destruction of religious images that occurred in Europe in the 16th century. During these spates of [[iconoclasm]], Catholic art and many forms of church fittings and decoration were destroyed in unofficial or mob actions by [[Calvinist]]{{dubious|date=June 2018}} Protestant crowds as part of the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref name="Marshall2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Byfield2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Byfield|first=Ted|title=A Century of Giants, A.D. 1500 to 1600: In an Age of Spiritual Genius, Western Christendom Shatters|year=2002|publisher=Christian History Project|language=English|isbn=9780968987391|page=297|quote=Devoutly Catholic but opposed to Inquisition tactics, they backed William of Orange in subduing the Calvinist uprising of the Dutch beeldenstorm on behalf of regent Margaret of Parma, and had come willingly to the council at her invitation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the destruction was of art in churches and public places.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"/&gt;

The Dutch term usually specifically refers to the wave of disorderly attacks in the summer of 1566 that spread rapidly through the [[Low Countries]] from south to north. Similar outbreaks of iconoclasm took place in other parts of Europe, especially [[Reformation in Switzerland|in Switzerland]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the period between 1522 and 1566, notably [[Zürich]] (in 1523), [[Copenhagen]] (1530), [[Münster]] (1534), [[Geneva]] (1535), and [[Augsburg]] (1537).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;John Phillips, ''Reformation of Images: Destruction of Art in England, 1535–1660'', (Berkeley: University of California Press) 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England there was both government-sponsored removal of images and also spontaneous attacks from 1535 onwards, and in [[Scotland]] from 1559.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In France there were several outbreaks as part of the [[French Wars of Religion]] from 1560 onwards.

==Background==
In France unofficial episodes of large scale destruction of art in churches by [[Huguenot]] Calvinists had begun in 1560; unlike in the Low Countries they were often physically resisted and repulsed by Roman Catholic crowds, but were to continue throughout the [[French Wars of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Eire, 279–280&lt;/ref&gt; In Anglican England much destruction had already taken place in an organized fashion under orders from the government,&lt;ref name="Buchanan2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Colin|title=The A to Z of Anglicanism|date=4 August 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=9780810870086|page=26|quote=Royal Injunctions order the reading of biblical passages in English at the mass, along with the destruction of images and the provision of a “poor men's box” for alms.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Northern Europe, groups of Calvinists marched through churches and removed images, a move which "provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs" in Germany and "antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox" in the Baltic region.&lt;ref name="Marshall2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=The Reformation|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780191578885|page=114|quote=Iconoclastic incidents during the Calvinist 'Second Reformation' in Germany provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs, while Protestant image-breaking in the Baltic region deeply antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox, a group with whom reformers might have hoped to make common cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somewhat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Holzschnitt Schoen Bildersturm 1530.jpg|thumb|320px|A German [[woodcut]] of 1530 titled ''Klagrede der armen verfolgten Götzen und Tempelbilder'' (English: "Complaint of the poor persecuted idols and temple pictures") by [[Erhard Schön]].]]
In Germany, Switzerland and England, conversion to Protestantism had been enforced on the whole population at the level of a city, principality or kingdom, with varying degrees of discrimination, persecution or expulsion applied to those who insisted on remaining Roman Catholic. The Low Countries, Flanders, [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Holland]],&lt;ref&gt;What is now approximately [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] was part of the [[Bishopric of Liège]] and ruled by the bishop (shown in brown on the map).&lt;/ref&gt; were part of the inheritance of [[Philip II of Spain]], who was a devout Catholic and self-proclaimed protector of the [[Counter-Reformation]], and [[suppression of dissent|suppressed]] Protestantism through his Governor-general or Regent, [[Margaret of Parma]] the illegitimate daughter of [[Emperor Charles V]], who was herself more willing to compromise. Although Protestants so far represented only a relatively small proportion of the Netherlandish population, but including disproportionate numbers from the nobility and upper [[bourgeoisie]], the Catholic Church had evidently lost the loyalty of the population, and traditional Catholic [[anti-clericalism]] was now dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

The region affected was perhaps the richest in Europe, but still seethed with economic discontent among parts of the population, and had suffered a poor harvest and hard winter. However, recent historians are generally less inclined to see the movement as prompted by these factors than was the case a few decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 95–98, and 116, especially note 105 (where "reputation" is presumably a misprint for "refutation"). Elliott, 89–91, first written in 1968, reflects a version of the older view, for which the German Marxist historian Erich Kuttner was the standard-bearer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DPGMstg0fosC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=iconoclasm+Beeldenstorm&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OstrTdHyEMKKhQeUmsygDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=iconoclasm%20Beeldenstorm&amp;f=false 179-80].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Die Predigt Johannes des Täufers (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|400px|An outdoor sermon (''The Preaching of St. John the Baptist'') depicted by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], apparently in 1565, the year before the Beeldenstorm movement began.]]
The Beeldenstorm grew out of a turn in the behaviour of Low Country Protestants starting around 1560, who became increasingly open in their religion, despite penal sanctions. Catholic preachers were interrupted in sermons, and raids were organized to rescue Protestant prisoners from jail, who then often fled into exile in France or England. Protestant views were spread by a large movement of "field sermons" or open-air sermons ({{lang-nl|hagepreken}}) held outside towns, and therefore out of the jurisdiction of the town authorities. The first took place on the ''Cloostervelt'' near [[Hondschoote]], in what is now the [[arrondissement of Dunkirk]] in [[French Flanders]], very close to where the attacks later began, and the first one to be armed against disruption was held near [[Boeschepe]] on July 12, 1562, two months after religious war had broken out again over the (then) French border just nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

These open-air sermons, mostly by [[Anabaptist]] or [[Mennonite]] preachers, spread through the country, attracting huge crowds, though not necessarily of those leaning to Protestantism, and in many places immediately preceded the iconoclastic attacks of August 1566. Prosecutions for [[heresy]] continued, especially in the south, although they were erratic, and in some places clergy of clearly heretical views{{Which|date=October 2017}} were appointed to churches. By 1565 the authorities seem to have realized that persecution was not the answer, and the level of prosecutions slackened, and the Protestants became increasingly confident in the open.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 82–86&lt;/ref&gt; A letter of July 22, 1566, from local officials to the Regent, warned that "the scandalous pillage of churches, monasteries and abbeys" was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low Countries iconoclastic attacks in 1566==
[[File:Tachtigjarigeoorlog-1566.png|thumb|300px|Blue: The spread of the Beeldenstorm in the Low Countries. Brown: Within the independent [[Bishopric of Liège]].]]

On August 10, 1566, the [[feast-day]] of [[Saint Lawrence]], at the end of the [[pilgrimage]] from Hondschoote to [[Steenvoorde]], the chapel of the ''Sint-Laurensklooster'' was defaced by a crowd who invaded the building. It has been suggested that the rioters connected the saint especially with Philip II, whose monastery palace of the [[Escorial]] near [[Madrid]] was dedicated to Lawrence, and was just nearing completion in 1566.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; Iconoclastic attacks spread rapidly northwards and resulted in the destruction of not only images but all sorts of decoration and fittings in churches and other church or clergy property. However, there was relatively little loss of life, unlike similar outbreaks in France, where the clergy were often killed, and some iconoclasts too.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 116&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacks reached the commercial centre of the Low Countries, Antwerp, on August 20, and on August 22 Ghent, where the cathedral, eight churches, twenty-five monasteries and convents, ten hospitals and seven chapels were wrecked. From there, it further spread east and north, reaching [[Amsterdam]], then a much smaller town, by August 23, and continuing in the far north and east into October, although the main towns were mostly attacked in August. [[Valenciennes]] ("Valencijn" on the map) was the most southerly town attacked. In the east, [[Maastricht]] on September 20 and [[Venlo]] on October 5 saw attacks, but generally the outbreaks were restricted to more westerly and northern areas.&lt;ref&gt;See map with dates in Petegree, 118; Arnade, 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; Over 400 churches were attacked in Flanders alone.&lt;ref&gt;Eire, 280&lt;/ref&gt;

The eye-witness [[Richard Clough]], a Welsh Protestant merchant then in Antwerp, saw: "all the churches, chapels and houses of religion utterly defaced, and no kind of thing left whole within them, but broken and utterly destroyed, being done after such order and by so few folks that it is to be marvelled at." The [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Church of Our Lady in Antwerp]], later made the cathedral (illustrated at top): "looked like a hell, with above 10,000 torches burning, and such a noise as if heaven and earth had got together, with falling of images and beating down of costly works, such sort that the spoil was so great that a man could not well pass through the church. So that in fine [short], I cannot write you in x sheets of paper the strange sight I saw there, organs and all destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;Spicer, 109 (spelling modernized); see also Arnade, 146–148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dutchrevolt.leiden.edu/english/sources/Pages/15660721.aspx Eye-witness Account of Image-breaking at Antwerp], Universiteit Leiden {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709173750/http://dutchrevolt.leiden.edu/english/sources/Pages/15660721.aspx |date=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolas Sander, an English Catholic exile who was a professor of theology at [[Old University of Louvain|Louvain]], described the destruction in the same church:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;these fresh followers of this new preaching threw down the graven [sculpted] and defaced the painted images, not only of Our Lady but of all others in the town. They tore the curtains, dashed in pieces the carved work of brass and stone, brake the altars, spoilt the clothes and corporesses, wrested the irons, conveyed away or brake the chalices and vestiments, pulled up the brass of the gravestones, not sparing the glass and seats which were made about the pillars of the church for men to sit in.&amp;nbsp;... the [[Blessed Sacrament]] of the altar&amp;nbsp;... they trod under their feet and (horrible it is to say!) shed their stinking piss upon it&amp;nbsp;... these false bretheren burned and rent not only all kind of Church books, but, moreover, destroyed whole libraries of books of all sciences and tongues, yea the Holy Scriptures and the [[church Fathers|ancient fathers]], and tore in pieces the maps and charts of the descriptions of countries.&lt;ref&gt;Miola, 58–59, 59 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:UtrechtIconoclasm.jpg|thumb|250px|Damaged relief statues in the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]].]]
Such details are corroborated by many other sources. Accounts of the actions of the iconoclasts from eyewitnesses and the records of the later trials of many of them make it clear that there was often a considerable element of [[carnival]] to the outbreaks, with much mockery of the images and fittings such as fonts recorded as the iconoclasts went about their work. Alcohol features largely in very many accounts, perhaps in some cases because in Netherlandish law being drunk could be regarded as a mitigating factor in criminal sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 105–111&lt;/ref&gt;

The destruction frequently included ransacking the priest's house, and sometimes private houses suspected of sheltering church goods. There was much looting of common household goods from clergy houses and monasteries, and some street robberies of women's jewellery by the crowd; after the images were smashed and the property occupied, "men fed their stomachs in a carnivalesque indulgence of beer, bread, butter and cheese, while women carted off provisions for the kitchen or bedroom".&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 111–112 (quote from 112); 102 for women's jewellery robbed.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many accounts of rituals of inversion, in which the church sometimes stood for the whole social order. Children sometimes participated enthusiastically, and street games afterwards became play battles between "[[papist]]s" and "[[Geuzen|beggars]]". One child was killed in Amsterdam by a stone thrown in such a game.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 111–114; for the whole paragraph: 104–122&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere the iconoclasts seemed to treat their actions as a job of work; in one city the group waited for the bell rung to mark the start of the working day before beginning their work. The tombs and memorial inscriptions of the [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patriciate]] and nobility, and in some cases royalty, were defaced or destroyed in several places, although secular public buildings such as town halls, and the palaces of the nobility, were not attacked.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 116–124&lt;/ref&gt; In Ghent, on the one hand the memorial in a church to Charles V's sister Isabel (and so Philip's aunt) was carefully left alone, but a statue in the street of Charles V and the Virgin was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

The actions were controversial among Protestants, some of whom implausibly tried to blame Catholic [[agent provocateur]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 117–119&lt;/ref&gt; as it became clear that "the more popular elements of the dissident movement were out of control".&lt;ref&gt;Wells, 91&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant ministers and activists returning from exile in England and elsewhere played a significant role, and individual wealthy Protestants were widely suspected of hiring men to do the work in some places, especially Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 116–117, and elsewhere, on returning exiles; Arnade, 146–147 on paid iconoclasts&lt;/ref&gt;

In some rural areas gangs of iconoclasts moved across country between village churches and monasteries for several days.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise History of Western Art|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|language=English |isbn=9781424069224|page=254|quote=In an episode known as the Great Iconoclasm, bands of Calvinists visited Catholic churches in the Netherlands in 1566, shattering stained-glass windows, smashing statues, and destroying paintings and other artworks they perceived as idolatrous.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 101–102; 104–109&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere there were large crowds involved, sometimes locals, and sometimes from outside the area. In some places the nobility gave assistance, ordering the clearing of churches on their estates. Local magistracies were often opposed, but ineffective in stopping the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 119–124; Arnade, 120–122&lt;/ref&gt; In many towns the archer's guild, who had a function in controlling public order, took no steps against the crowds.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 120&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1566, unlike the situation after the [[Eighty Years War]] and today, Protestantism in the Low Countries was mainly concentrated in the south (roughly modern [[Belgium]]), and much weaker in the north (roughly now the [[Netherlands]]), and iconoclasm in the north began later, after news of the events in Antwerp was received, and was more successfully resisted by local authorities in some towns, although still succeeding in most.&lt;ref name="Brouwer2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brouwer|first=Maria|title=Governmental Forms and Economic Development: From Medieval to Modern Times|date=11 August 2016|publisher=Springer|language=English|isbn=9783319420400|page=224|quote=The city of Amsterdam pursued a policy of restraint against the Calvinists. The iconoclast movement reached Amsterdam in August 1566, but the city government had moved and stored away many church possessions before the iconoclasts reached the city. All churches were closed to tame the fury.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again individually socially prominent laymen often took the lead.&lt;ref&gt;Petegree, 124–128&lt;/ref&gt; In many places there were, or were later said to have been, false claims of official commissions from some local authority to perform the actions, and by the end of the outbreak some northern towns removed images by order of the local authority, presumably to prevent the disorder that would accompany a mob action.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 120–122&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the records of the later trials show a wide range of occupations, covering craftsmen and small tradespeople, especially in the textile trade, and also a variety of church employees, at a fairly low level. Where wealth and property are recorded, it is "modest at best".&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Stille beeldenstorm" of 1581 in Antwerp==
Following the 1566 attacks in Antwerp there was a further period of iconoclasm there in 1581, after a Calvinist city council was elected and purged the city's clergy and guilds of Catholic office-holders. This is known as the "quiet" or "stille" beeldenstorm, as the removal of images was carried out by the institutions they belonged to, the council itself, churches and the guilds. Some images were sold rather than destroyed, but most seem to have been lost. By the summer of 1584 Antwerp was [[Fall of Antwerp|besieged by the Duke of Parma's Spanish army]], falling a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic losses==
[[File:Le Sac de Lyon par les Réformés - Vers1565.jpg|thumb|300px|The looting of the Churches of Lyon by Calvinists in 1562.]]
Rarely was any thought given to the artistic heritage of these cities in 1566, though families were sometimes able to protect the [[church monument]]s of their ancestors, and in [[Delft]] the syndics of the painters' [[Guild of Saint Luke]] were able to rescue the altarpiece by [[Maarten van Heemskerck]], which the guild had commissioned only 15 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Montias, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[van Eyck]]s' [[Ghent Altarpiece]], then as now famous as a supreme example of [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and already a major tourist attraction, just restored in 1550, was saved by dismantling it and hiding it in the cathedral tower. A first attack on August 19 was deterred by a small number of guards. When a larger attack was made at night two days later the iconoclasts had provided themselves with a tree trunk as a battering ram, and succeeded in breaking through the doors.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Charney, 72–73 - a populist account; when he says April he means August, and "The Lamb" refers to the altarpiece. Petegree, 118 has the Beeldenstorm reaching Ghent on August 22. See also Arnade, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

By then the panels had been removed from the frame and hidden, with the guards, on the narrow spiral staircase up the tower, with a locked door at ground level. They were not detected and the crowd left after destroying what else they could find.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The panels were then moved to the town hall, and only returned to view in 1569, by which time the elaborate frame had disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0X5lErg2tsC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=iconoclasm+%22Ghent+altarpiece%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gNJpTbjeIoiGhQedwbCfDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Early Netherlandish Paintings: Rediscovery, Reception and Research|first1=Bernhard|last1=Ridderbos|first2=Henk Th van|last2=Veen|first3=Anne van|last3=Buren|date=25 March 2018|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An altarpiece in [[Culemborg]] had been commissioned in 1557 from the painter Jan Dey, was then destroyed in 1566 and in 1570 recommissioned from Dey, apparently as a copy of the first.

==Consequences==
[[File:Kreuz von stadelhofen.jpg|thumb|300px|Later depiction of the destruction of a wayside cross in [[Zurich]] in 1523.]]
On August 23, [[Margaret of Parma]], the Habsburg Regent or Governor-general, whose capital of [[Brussels]] was unaffected by the movement, agreed to an "Accord" with the group of aristocratic Protestant leaders known as the "Compromise" or ''[[Geuzen]]'' ("Beggars"), by which freedom of religion was granted, in exchange for allowing Catholics to worship unmolested and an end to the violence. Instead, "the outbreak of the iconoclastic fury began an almost uninterrupted series of skirmishes, campaigns, plunder, pirate-raids, and other acts of violence. Not all areas suffered violence at the same time or to the same extent, but practically none remained unscathed."&lt;ref&gt;Lesger, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Many elite Protestants were now alarmed by the forces unleashed, and some of the nobility began to shift towards support of the government. Implementing the somewhat vague terms of the agreement led to further tensions, and [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], appointed by Margaret to resolve the situation in Antwerp, tried and failed to produce a wider settlement that all parties could live with. Instead unrest continued and the episode fed into the [[causes of the Dutch Revolt]] which was to erupt two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, 91–93; Petegree, 132–134; Wells, 89–91; Arnade, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29 Margaret wrote a somewhat panicked letter to Philip, "claiming that half the population were infected with heresy, and that over 200,000 people were up in arms against her authority".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JxK_O5IclRIC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=Iconoclasm+1566&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=jBXZSZTZKpWQMqKfgLoB#v=onepage&amp;q=Iconoclasm+1566&amp;f=false|title=Immigrants and the Industries of London, 1500-1700|first=Liên|last=Luu|date=25 March 2018|publisher=Ashgate|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip decided to send the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] with an army; he would have led them himself but was kept in Spain by other matters, especially the increasingly evident insanity of his heir, [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXK2fxzn2lAC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=iconoclasm+Beeldenstorm&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LzNrTefmAYa4hAeRtOjsDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=iconoclasm+Beeldenstorm&amp;f=false|title=The Political Thought of the Dutch Revolt 1555-1590|first=Martin van|last=Gelderen|date=3 October 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Alba arrived the following year, and soon replaced Margaret as Governor-general, his heavy-handed repression, which included the execution of many convicted of iconoclastic attacks the summer before, only made the situation worse.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Antwerp was then Europe's largest financial and international trading centre, taking as much as 75 or 80% of English exports of cloth,&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; and the disturbances created serious and well-justified fears that its position as such was under threat. Sir [[Thomas Gresham]], the English financier who arranged [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s borrowings, and whose agent in Antwerp was Clough, left London for Antwerp on August 23, only hearing about the Antwerp attacks ''en route''; he needed to roll-over 32,000 Flemish pounds and borrow another 20,000 to finance her expenses in Ireland. Dining with William of Orange on his arrival, he was asked if "the English were minded to depart this town or not", and wrote to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], Elizabeth's chief minister, "in alarm that he "liked none of their proceedings" but "apprehended great mischief", and urged that the English government "should do very well in time to consider some other realm and place" for marketing English products. It was a message that helped shape the course of events."&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The English had found the Antwerp [[money market]] short of funds since earlier in the year, and now made use of [[Cologne]] and [[Augsburg]] as well, but as events unfolded in the next year, and the personal position of some leading lenders became precarious, the English found to their surprise that repayments were no longer pressed for, probably as the lenders were happy to keep their money abroad on loan to a secure borrower.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch Revolt, which from 1585 onwards included a Dutch blockade of the River [[Scheldt]] leading to the city, was to finally destroy Antwerp as a major trading centre.

[[File:Dirck van Delen - Beeldenstorm in een kerk.jpg|thumb|300px|The painting ''Beeldenstorm in een kerk'', 1630, by [[Dirck van Delen]], six decades after the original actions.]]
In many places there were attempts by Calvinist preachers to take over the ransacked buildings. These were usually repulsed in the period after the attacks. In the months afterwards there were attempted negotiations in many cities, by William of Orange and others, to allocate certain churches to accommodate the local Protestants, often divided into [[Lutheran]]s and Calvinists. These had mostly failed within a few weeks, not least because Margaret's government rejected them; she had already had an earlier attempt at compromise overruled by Philip a few months earlier, and been embarrassingly forced to retract a decree.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, 48&lt;/ref&gt; Instead there was a wave of building or adapting Calvinist "temples", though in the end none of these were to remain in use by the following year, and their layouts, which seem to have echoed early Swiss and Scottish Calvinist designs, are now largely unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Spicer, 110–118&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the revolt proper had started, there were many further instances of clearing churches, some still unofficial and disorderly, but as cities became officially Protestant, increasingly undertaken by official order, like the Amsterdam [[Alteratie]] ("Alteration") of 1578. Altars, to which Calvinists, unlike Lutherans, took strong exception, were typically completely removed, and in some large churches, like Utrecht Cathedral, large tomb monuments put where they stood, partly to make their return more difficult if political conditions changed. After the Eighty Years War was finally over, in the cities and areas that became Protestant, the old Catholic churches were all or nearly all taken over by the new [[established church]] of the Calvinist [[Dutch Reformed Church]], with other congregations left to shift for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Spicer, 116–124, and following pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The bare and empty state of those churches left in Catholic hands after the hostilities eventually ended prompted a large programme of restocking with Catholic art, which had much to do with the vigour of [[Northern Mannerism]] and later [[Flemish Baroque painting]], and many Gothic churches were given [[Baroque]] makeovers.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 4, 13&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, now very largely Protestant, religious art largely disappeared, and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] concentrated on a wide range of secular subjects, such as [[genre painting]], [[landscape art]] and [[still-life]]s, with results that might sometimes have surprised the Protestant ministers who initiated the movement. According to one scholar, this "was not only a dramatic change in the function of art, it was the context in which our present concept of art, what the literary critic [[M. H. Abrams]] called "art as such", first began to take shape", replacing a "construction model" where art theory concerned itself with how the maker created his work, with a "contemplation model" concerned with the effect of the finished work on a "lone perceiver" or viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (short quotes from Abrams), 131&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Café Terrace at Night''''' is an 1888 oil painting by the Dutch artist [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It is also known as '''''The Cafe Terrace on the Place du Forum''''', and, when first exhibited in 1891, was entitled '''''Coffeehouse, in the evening''''' (''Café, le soir'').

Van Gogh painted ''Café Terrace at Night'' in [[Arles]], France, in mid-September 1888. The painting is not signed, but described and mentioned by the artist in three letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/search/advanced?originaltext=original&amp;translation=translation&amp;annotations=notes&amp;essays=essays&amp;other=other&amp;from=1&amp;to=1&amp;date_from=1872-09-29&amp;date_until=1890-07-31&amp;order=date&amp;workofart_code=i2714 See www.vangoghletters.org, Advanced Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors to the site can stand at the northeastern corner of the ''Place du Forum'', where the artist set up his easel. The site was refurbished in 1990 and 1991 to replicate van Gogh's painting. He looked south towards the artificially lit [[sidewalk cafe|terrace]] of the popular coffee house, as well as into the enforced darkness of the ''rue du Palais'' which led up to a building structure (to the left, not pictured) and, beyond this structure, the tower of a former church which is now ''Musée Lapidaire''.

Towards the right, Van Gogh indicated a lighted shop as well, and some branches of the trees surrounding the place—but he omitted the remainders of the Roman monuments just beside this little shop.

The painting is currently at the [[Kröller-Müller Museum]] in [[Otterlo]], Netherlands.

After finishing ''Café Terrace at Night'', Van Gogh wrote a letter to his sister expressing his enthusiasm:

{{quote|I was interrupted precisely by the work that a new painting of the outside of a café in the evening has been giving me these past few days. On the terrace, there are little figures of people drinking. A huge yellow lantern lights the terrace, the façade, the pavement, and even projects light over the cobblestones of the street, which takes on a violet-pink tinge. The gables of the houses on a street that leads away under the blue sky studded with stars are dark blue or violet, with a green tree. Now there’s a painting of night without black. With nothing but beautiful blue, violet and green, and in these surroundings the lighted square is coloured pale sulphur, lemon green. I enormously enjoy painting on the spot at night. In the past they used to draw, and paint the picture from the drawing in the daytime. But I find that it suits me to paint the thing straightaway. It’s quite true that I may take a blue for a green in the dark, a blue lilac for a pink lilac, since you can’t make out the nature of the tone clearly. But it’s the only way of getting away from the conventional black night with a poor, pallid and whitish light, while in fact a mere candle by itself gives us the richest yellows and oranges.&lt;ref name=let678&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let678/letter.html Letter 678 (in French)]  from Vincent van Gogh to Wilhelmina van Gogh, Arles, 9 and 16 September 1888&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He continues, in this same letter, {{quote|You never told me if you had read Guy de Maupassant’s Bel-ami, and what you now think of his talent in general. I say this because the beginning of Bel-ami is precisely the description of a starry night in Paris, with the lighted cafés of the boulevard, and it’s something like the same subject that I’ve painted just now.&lt;ref name=let678/&gt;}}

[[File:Van gogh cafe arles.jpg|thumb|upright|The café terrace, now 'Le Café La Nuit', at Place du Forum, [[Arles]], July 2016]]
This excerpt forms the basis of the  [[Van Gogh Museum|Van Gogh Museum's]] curators' opinion that the painting is a depiction "''of drinkers in the harsh, bright lights of their illuminated facades''" from [[Guy de Maupassant|Maupassant]]'s novel ''[[Bel Ami]]'', however, they also note that Maupassant makes no mention of a 'starry sky.'&lt;ref name=let678/&gt;
In 1981, Bogomila Welsh-Ovcharov argued that since it "displays not only a night scene but also a funnel-like perspective and dominant blue-yellow tonality" it was at least partially inspired by [[Louis Anquetin|Louis Anquetin's]] ''Avenue de Clichy: 5 o'clock in the evening.''&lt;ref&gt;Welsh-Ovcharov, Bogomila: ''Vincent van Gogh and the Birth of Cloisonism'' (!), Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 24 January - 22 March 1981 and Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, Amsterdam, 9 April - 14 June 1989  {{ISBN|0-919876-66-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic paper presented at [[IAFOR]]'s 2013 European Conference on Arts &amp; Humanities, however, advanced the theory that van Gogh intended the painting to be a uniquely innovated ''[[Last Supper]]''. The paper was subsequently published by The Art Histories Society in the January, 2014 ''Art History Supplement''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arths.org.uk/about/arthsa/issue41 See ''Art History Supplement'' vol. 4, issue 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106100842/http://www.arths.org.uk/about/arthsa/issue41 |date=2014-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the July, 2014 fourteenth volume of ''The Anistoriton Journal of History, Archaeology and Art History''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anistor.gr/english/index.htm See ''Anistoriton Journal of History, Archaeology and Art History'' Volume 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

Briefly, the paper examines the myriad artistic influences van Gogh was parsing the summer of 1888: his lifelong devotion to and imitation of [[Jesus Christ]]; synthesizing ''[[Japonism]]'' and ''[[Cloisonnism]]'' with his own ''[[plein air]]'' techniques; colorizing [[Jean-François Millet]]'s pious genre scenes with [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s luminous palette (see [[Boats du Rhône]]); "search-for-sacred-realism" correspondence with his artist friend [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]]; [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Boccaccio]]'s examples of dressing old ideas in new clothes; an [[Émile-Louis Burnouf|Émile Burnouf]] article claiming Buddhist missionaries sowed the seeds [[Essenes]] later reaped as Christianity; failed attempts creating his own Christ in the Garden of Olives; two proximal ''Last Supper'' studies (''[[Interior of a Restaurant in Arles]]'' and ''[[Interior of a Restaurant in Arles|Interior of the Restaurant Carrel in Arles]]'') featuring straw-bottomed chairs he'd just purchased by the dozen (hoping to start a commune of twelve "artist-apostles" at his [[The Yellow House (painting)|Yellow House]]); culminating with his composition of twelve diners drenched in a yellow halo surrounding a Rembrandtesque server framed by a crucifix at the vanishing point of the picture; it's concluded his original starry night is a [[Symbolist|Symbolist's]] ''Last Supper''.

Although van Gogh never explicitly mentioned his intent in any existing letter, he did write his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] two weeks later, "That doesn't stop me having a terrible need for - dare I say the word - for religion. So I go outside at night to paint the stars and I always dream a painting like that with a group of living figures of the pals."&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let691/letter.html www.vangoghletters.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Night effects==
When exhibited for the first time, in 1891, the painting was entitled '''''Coffeehouse, in the evening''''' (''Café, le soir'').

This is the first painting in which he used starry backgrounds; he went on to paint star-filled skies in ''[[Starry Night Over the Rhône]]'' (painted the same month), and the better known ''[[The Starry Night]]'' a year later. Van Gogh also painted a starlight background in ''[[Portrait of Eugène Boch]]''.  Van Gogh mentioned the ''Cafe Terrace'' painting in a letter written to [[Eugène Boch]] on October 2, 1888, writing he had painted "a view of the café on place du Forum, where we used to go, ''painted at night''" (emphasis van Gogh's).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugeneboch.com/letter.htm Letter to Eugene Boch mentioning the Cafe Terrace] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729172453/http://www.eugeneboch.com/letter.htm |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The painting and the café were both featured in the 1956 film ''[[Lust for Life (film)|Lust for Life]]'' starring [[Kirk Douglas]] and later in "[[Vincent and the Doctor]]" (2010), the tenth episode in the [[Doctor Who (series 5)|fifth series]] of British [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=A Brush with Genius|series=[[Doctor Who Confidential]]|airdate=5 June 2010|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Three]]|seriesno=5|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the fully painted film ''[[Loving Vincent]]'' (2017).

== Color ==
"This is a night painting without black, with nothing but beautiful blue and violet and green and in this surrounding the illuminated area colors itself sulfur pale yellow and citron green."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-van-gogh-vincent-artworks.htm|title=Vincent van Gogh Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Calcutta Group''' was a group of [[modern art]]ists in [[India]], formed in 1943 in [[Kolkata]]. It has the distinction of being the first artistic movement of its kind in both Bengal and all of India. Though short-lived – the group disbanded in 1953 – the Calcutta Group was instrumental in the transformation of contemporary Indian art and brought this genre onto the world stage.

== Members ==

=== Core Members (1943) ===

* [[Tagore family|Subho Tagore]]
* [[Nirode Mazumdar]]
* [[Rathin Moitra]]
* [[Prankrishna Pal]]
* [[Gopal Ghose|Gopal Ghosh]]
* [[Paritosh Sen]]
* [[Pradosh Das Gupta]] 
* [[Kamala Das Gupta]]

=== Additional Members ===

* [[Abani Sen]] (1947)
* [[Gobardhan Ash]] (1950)
* [[Sunil Madhav Sen]] (1952)
* [[Hemant Mishra|Hemant Misra]] (1953)

== Formation ==
Subho Tagore, nephew of Abanindranath and Grand-nephew of Rabindranath Tagore, was a budding artist who studied art at the Governmental School of Art in Calcutta. After traveling to London for a few years in order to hone his artistic skills, he moved back to India with the idea of creating a group for plastic artists. Along with fellow painters Nirode Mazumdar, Rathin Maitra, Prankrishna Pal and Gopal Ghosh, he formally created the Calcutta Group in 1943. Later that year, another painter, Paritosh Sen, along with sculptors Pradosh Das Gupta, Kamala  Das Gupta joined the society. These eight members were known as the organization's core, as well as the driving force behind it. Over the years, other artists joined the group as well including Abani Sen in 1947, Gobardhan Ash in 1950, Sunil Madhav Sen in 1952, and Hemanta Mistra in 1953.

== Philosophy ==
During this period of time, Bengal - a state in India, home to many of the group's members -  had been facing many tragedies including wars, famines, massacres, and even the partition of the country. Stemming from these events, the members of the Calcutta Group focused not on aesthetic, but on the social and political realities of the state and nation at the time. Many of the group's members were actually sympathetic towards the Communist Party that was making its way through India and some were even militants themselves. The group's manifesto was a synthesis of all of these ideas that stressed two main points: renouncement of religion in art and creation of opportunities for Indian art to modernize. The first idea was meant to remove the evils of demagoguery and elitism and produce works that focused on the population as a whole. However, the dismissal of works based n Hindu mythology came across as anti-religious and even atheist and therefore shocked many, leading to the moniker "Artistic Scandal".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5030">The following is '''a list of unproduced [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] projects''' in roughly chronological order. During his long career, American film director [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects, are officially scrapped or fell in [[development hell]].
== 1980s ==

=== ''Indiana Jones and the Monkey King'' ===
In 1985, Columbus wrote an script for a third ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' film entitled ''Indiana Jones and the Monkey King''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5932803/100-wonderful-and-terrible-movies-that-never-existed|title=100 Wonderful and Terrible Movies That Never Existed|first=Charlie Jane|last=Anders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus' script was about the trip of Indy along his assistant Betsy to a secret city protected by soldier gorillas and governed by the evil [[Monkey King]]. According to Columbus, he wrote the script so that the story doesn't look like the previous film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/31313/lost-scripts-part-i-indiana-jones-and-monkey-king|title=The Lost Scripts, Part I: Indiana Jones and the Monkey King|date=26 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the end, Columbus' script was rejected and the film was finally released in 1989 under the title ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' and directed by [[Steven Spielberg]].

== 1990s ==

=== ''Fantastic Four'' ===
In 1995, Columbus wrote for [[20th Century Fox]] a script for the long time planned ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' feature-length film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1995/voices/columns/columbus-seeing-red-after-nine-reviews-1117862735/|title=Columbus seeing red after ‘Nine’ reviews|first=Army|last=Archerd|date=13 July 1995|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was supposed to be released around the 2001 summer. [[Peter Segal]] was attached to direct it, but later, he dropped the project, so [[Raja Gosnell]]  took the director's chair, but he dropped it after being hired by [[Warner Bros.]] to direct ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' and [[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed|its sequel]]. After this, director [[Peyton Reed]] entered into the project and wanted to cast [[Renée Zellweger]] as [[Invisible Woman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therobotsvoice.com/2015/02/fantastic_four_marvel_chris_columbus_dr_doom_miles_teller_kate_mara_michael_b_jordan_tim_story.php|title=9 Things Fox Got Right With Their 1996 Fantastic Four Script...That We Never Got to See - The Robot's Voice|date=11 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|film]] was finally released in 2005, directed by [[Tim Story]] and written by [[Michael France]] and [[Mark Frost]].

=== ''Galaxy High School'' ===
Plans for a live-action film adaptation of his own 1986 animated TV series [[Galaxy High]] was planned in partnership with [[John H. Williams]] of [[Vanguard Films &amp; Animation|Vanguard Films]], and reteamed with Chris Columbus to develop the big screen version of ''Galaxy High School''. After various development deals with both [[DreamWorks]] and [[Paramount Pictures]], Sofare nothing ever came out of it, either being scrapped or in [[development hell]].

=== ''Daredevil'' ===
In 1997, Columbus was hired by [[Columbia Pictures]] to write an script for a ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'' feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/04/26/daredevil-the-man-without-ed|title=Daredevil: The Man Without Ed|first=|last=Stax|date=26 April 2001|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus' script was later leaked on Internet in 1999. Despite this, Columbia dropped the project and [[20th Century Fox]] bought the rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/movies|title=Movie Reviews, Trailers, Interviews, Wikis &amp; Posters for Movies - IGN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was finally released in 2003 and directed by [[Mark Steven Johnson]].

== 2000s ==

=== ''The Sub-Mariner'' ===
In July 2004, Columbus was hired to direct a film adaptation of [[Namor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/news/columbus-off-to-sea-1117914347/|title=Columbus off to sea|first=Claude|last=Brodesser|date=3 December 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was supposed to be released in 2007 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/87061-marvels-film-slate-from-3rd-quarter-report|title=Marvel's Film Slate From 3rd Quarter Report - SuperHeroHype|date=28 October 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2005, Columbus abandoned the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/features/89791-chris-columbus-passes-on-sub-mariner|title=Chris Columbus Passes on Sub-Mariner - SuperHeroHype|date=12 November 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Daisy-Head Mayzie''''' is a [[children's book]] written by [[Dr. Seuss]] and illustrated in his style. It was published in 1995, as Seuss's last book before his death. It was republished on July 5, 2016 with Seuss's original drawings.

==Plot==
The book is about a 12-year-old warmhearted schoolgirl named Mayzie who one day suddenly sprouts a bright white daisy from her head. It causes alarm in her classroom, family, and town, until an agent makes her a celebrity. [[The Cat in the Hat]] who serves as the narrator to this story helps Mayzie to understand her problem and persuade her to go back home. The book has a mini-song titled "Daisy-Head Mayzie" which her classmates chant.

== Adaptations==
In 1995, prior to its actual publication, the book was adapted into a special for television on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]. The special, which was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]], can be found as a bonus feature on the ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' Deluxe Edition DVD.

In 2011, Daisy-Head Mayzie was made a meetable character at [[Seuss Landing]] at Universal's Islands of Adventure.

===Cast===
*[[Francesca Marie Smith|Francesca Smith]] - Mayzie McGrew
*[[Henry Gibson]] - [[The Cat in the Hat]]
*[[Tim Curry]] - Finagle
*[[George Hearn]] - Mayor
*[[Lewis Arquette]] - Principal
*[[Jonathan Winters]] - Dr. Eisenbart
*[[Susan Silo]] - Miss Sneetcher
*[[B. J. Ward (actress)|B. J. Ward]] - Mrs. McGrew
*[[Paul Eiding]] - Mr. McGrew
*[[Robert Ridgely]] - Finch
*Benjamin Smith - Butch
*John Graas - Einstein

==Differences in the 2016 edition==
In 2016, after the popularity of ''[[What Pet Should I Get?]]'', the book was republished with Seuss' original text and illustrations. As such, there are several differences between the editions.

*The Cat in the Hat does not appear as the narrator. 
*The characters are all designed differently and are given normal hairstyles, as opposed to the wild hairstyles in the 1995 edition.
*The principal is named Grumm instead of McGrumm.
*Instead of catching all of the bees in his hat, the police officer puts a fishbowl over Mayzie's head to protect her from the bees.
*Mrs. McGrew is a housewife instead of a welder.
*The plot in which the agent gives Mayzie a contract to be rich and famous is completely absent.
*Because of the absence of the Cat in the Hat, the daisy instead assures Mayzie that everyone loves her, and her flight with the Cat on the flying umbrella is not present.

'''Dracula's Guest''' is a [[short story]] by [[Bram Stoker]] and published in the short story collection ''[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories]]''.

== Origin ==

It is widely believed that "Dracula's Guest" is actually the deleted first chapter from the original ''[[Dracula]]'' manuscript, which the publisher felt was superfluous to the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It was originally excised owing to the length of the book, and may prove of interest to the many readers of what is considered my husband's most remarkable work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Leslie S. Klinger]], who had access to Stoker's original ''Dracula'' manuscript&lt;ref&gt;Klinger, page xii&lt;/ref&gt; while researching his 2008 book ''The New Annotated Dracula'', saw evidence of "Dracula's Guest" having been deleted from the manuscript, such as a deleted sentence of Harker commenting that his throat is "still sore from the licking of the gray wolf's file-like tongue"&lt;ref&gt;Klinger, page 39, note 99&lt;/ref&gt; and the first and second chapters of the finished novel being labeled in the manuscript as "ii"&lt;ref&gt;Klinger, page 9, note 1&lt;/ref&gt; and "iii".&lt;ref&gt;Klinger, page 40, note 1&lt;/ref&gt; Klinger ultimately concludes the following:

{{blockquote|And so what may we make of ["Dracula's Guest"]? Without the name "Dracula" appearing in the title and [Dracula's] message [sent to the narrator], there would be very little to connect this traveler's tale with [the novel ''Dracula'']. The style is completely different; the narrator shares few characteristics with Jonathan Harker; and the action somehow fails to connect the story set forth in [''Dracula'']. However, there are numerous references in the [''Dracula''] Manuscript to some version of the tale eventually published as "Dracula's Guest." Most likely, a different draft — one that identified the narrator as Harker — was included in ... an early version of [the ''Dracula'' manuscript]. It may be that Stoker's publisher requested that the book be shortened, or the publisher (or Stoker) may have felt that the "stylistic" aspects of the narrative were more important than its veracity. For whatever reason, the material was excised, and only later did Stoker return to the material and work it into its published form.&lt;ref&gt;Klinger, page 515, note 27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Plot summary ==

"Dracula's Guest" follows an Englishman (whose name is never mentioned, but is presumed to be [[Jonathan Harker]]) on a visit to [[Munich]] before leaving for [[Transylvania]]. It is [[Walpurgis Night]], and in spite of the hotelier's warning to not return late, the young man later leaves his carriage and wanders toward the direction of an abandoned "unholy" village. As the carriage departs with the frightened and superstitious driver, a tall and thin stranger scares the horses at the crest of a hill.

After a few hours, as he reaches a desolate valley, it begins to snow; as a dark storm gathers intensity, the Englishman takes shelter in a grove of [[cypress]] and [[Taxus baccata|yew]] trees. The Englishman's location is soon illuminated by moonlight to be a cemetery, and he finds himself before a marble tomb with a large iron stake driven through the roof, the inscription reads: Countess Dolingen of [[Graz|Gratz]] / in [[Styria]] / sought and found death / 1801. Inscribed on the back of the tomb "graven in great Russian letters" is: "The dead travel fast", which was an ode to the fable "[[Lenore (ballad)|Lenore]]".

The Englishman is disturbed to be in such a place on such a night and as the storm breaks anew, he is forced by pelting hail to shelter in the doorway of the tomb. As he does so, the bronze door of the tomb opens under his weight and a flash of forked lightning shows the interior - and a "beautiful woman with rounded cheeks and red lips, seemingly sleeping on a bier". The force of the following thunder peal throws the Englishman from the doorway (experienced as "being grasped as by the hand of a giant") as another lightning bolt strikes the iron spike, destroying the tomb and the now screaming woman inside.

The Englishman's troubles are not quite over, as he painfully regains his senses from the ordeal, he is repulsed by a feeling of loathing which he connects to a warm feeling in his chest and a licking at this throat. The Englishman summons courage to peek through his eyelashes and discovers a gigantic [[wolf]] with flaming eyes is attending him.

Military horsemen are the next to wake the semi-conscious man, chasing the wolf away with torches and guns. Some horsemen return to the main party and the Englishman after the chase, reporting that they had not found 'him' and that the Englishman's animal is "[[werewolf|a wolf - and yet not a wolf]]".
They also note that blood is on the ruined tomb, yet the Englishman's neck is unbloodied. "See comrades, the wolf has been lying on him and keeping his blood warm". Later, the Englishman finds his neck pained when a horseman comments on it.

When the Englishman is taken back to his hotel by the men, he is informed that it is none other than his expectant host Dracula that has alerted his employees, the horsemen, of "dangers from snow and wolves and night" in a telegram received by the hotel during the time the Englishman was away.

'''''Emergence from Chaos''''' is a 1957 book by the English writer [[Stuart Holroyd]]. In the first part of the book, Holroyd discusses different types of spirituality, while in the second part—roughly two thirds of the book—these distinctions are used to analyse the works of six different poets, each of whom reacted to the issues of [[modernity]] with his own spiritual vision. The book was Holroyd's debut and is associated with the phenomenon of the [[Angry Young Men]].

==Reception==
[[Burns Singer]] wrote in ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'': "Repeatedly, whenever I have met him, Mr [[Stuart Holroyd]] has struck me as an unusually intelligent, modest, and cultivated young man. His book, unfortunately, displays none of these qualities, unless it be in homeopathic doses." Singer continued: "Mr Holroyd's mind is quite obviously of the kind that can absorb a good deal of experience, that needs years to mature. In this he differs from the figure with whom he will inevitably be compared, Mr [[Colin Wilson]]. ... But he does need these years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Singer|first=Burns|authorlink=Burns Singer|date=July 1957|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Encounter-1957jul-00086?View=PDF|title=In Briefs|work=[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]|pp=86–87|accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Bittner of the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' wrote that "Holroyd's discussions of individual poets are fascinating but uneven". Bittner's main objection was to Holroyd's rejection of [[materialism]]: "The flaw in Holroyd's thinking lies in his antiquated notion about the mystical artist. All truly great artists are mystics, but mystics with a difference. They seek, not to be unified with deity, but to be unified with the world as it is." Bittner nevertheless described the book as "sensitive and perceptive".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bittner|first=William|date=1957-10-05|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1957oct05-00013?View=PDF|title=The 'Beat' Generation Attacks|work=[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]|pp=13–14|accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fairytale Forest''' (''Sprookjesbos'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) is a {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} wooded section of the [[amusement park]] [[Efteling]] in the [[Netherlands]], where a number of well-known [[fairy tale]]s and fairy tale figures are depicted by animated statues and buildings.  Most of the figures are inspired by the [[Brothers Grimm]], [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and [[Charles Perrault]].
[[Image:Sprookjesbosbord.jpg|250px|thumb|right|''Fairytale Forest'']]

==History==
[[Image:Zonnestralen.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Truly enchanted forest]]

===Concept and building===
The Fairytale Forest was founded on the work of R.J.Th. van der Heijden, Peter Reijnders and Anton Pieck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holland's rival to Disneyland|url=http://www.windmillfields.com/2012/03/hollands-rival-to-disneyland.html|work=Tales from the Windmill Fields|publisher=Windmill Tales|accessdate=3 June 2012|date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Heijden conceived of the idea in the 1950s to boost [[tourism]]. He asked his brother-in-law [[Peter Reijnders]], a filmmaker and amateur inventor from [[Eindhoven]], to recreate a fairy tale [[theme park]] Reijnders built. Reijnders chose artist [[Anton Pieck]], whose visual style had been inspired by [[Arthur Rackham]] and [[Edmund Dulac]], to add the artistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sprookjesbos|url=http://www.efteling.com/NL/attracties/Sprookjesbos.html|work=Efteling|publisher=Efteling|accessdate=3 June 2012|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The first scenes===
It took roughly two years to develop and build the first ten fairy tales:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efteling reviews|url=http://www.themeparkinsider.com/reviews/efteling/|work=Theme Park Insider|publisher=Robert Niles|accessdate=3 June 2012|author=Leroy Koevoets|date=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Chinese Nightingale]], The Naughty Princess, [[Sleeping Beauty]], The [[Gnome]] Village, "Number One" (referring to the toilets), [[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]], The Magic Clock, [[Mother Hulda|Mother Holle]], [[Snow White]] and The Six Servants.

===Fairytale Forest===
The Fairytale Forest has 25 scenes.  Some include specific events such as Little Red Riding Hood at the door of her grandmother's house; while others are more general, such as The Gnome Village. There are three types of fairy tale scenes: indoor scenes with a commentary telling the tale (such as The Indian Water Lilies); structures too small to enter, but which can be viewed by visitors through the windows (Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother's house); and open-air attractions, such as the fountain for The Frog King or The Naughty Princess. In some cases, the tale is presented via electronic voice-over; in other cases the tale can be read from a book provided nearby (usually in Dutch, English, German and French).

===Origins of the scenes===
There are ten scenes based on [[Brothers Grimm]] fairytales:  [[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids|The Wolf and the Seven Kids]], [[Snow White]], [[Hansel and Gretel]], [[Rumpelstilskin]], [[Mother Hulda|Mother Holle]], [[The Six Servants]] ([[Long-neck]]), [[Rapunzel]], [[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog King]], [[The Wishing-Table]] and [[Sleeping Beauty]]. Three scenes are fairy tales from ''Mother Goose’s Fairy Tales'' by [[Charles Perrault]]: [[Tom Thumb]], [[Little Red Riding Hood]] and [[Cinderella]]. Five scenes are from [[Hans Christian Andersen]] tales: [[The Emperor's New Clothes]], [[The Red Shoes (fairy tale)|The Red Shoes]], [[The Little Mermaid]], [[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Chinese Nightingale]] and [[The Little Match Girl]]. The tale of The Indian Water Lilies was written by [[Fabiola de Mora y Aragón]]. The remaining scenes either do not have a matching tale (such as The Gnome Village and Holle Bolle Gijs) or a tale was created afterwards (such as The Gardener and the Fakir&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plaat 6 - Indische Waterlelies, Chinese Nachtegaal, Fakir, Magische Klok|url=http://www.wonderlijkewcweb.org/index.htm?/sprookjeslps/indexmusic.htm?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.wonderlijkewcweb.org/sprookjeslps/plaat6.htm|work=Sprookjes van de Efteling|publisher=Teksten|accessdate=3 June 2012|language=Dutch|quote=The story (in Dutch) of the Gardener and the Fakir}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Magic Clock).

==The Paper Gobblers==
{{double image|right|Efteling - Holle Bolle Gijs.jpg|140|opagijs.jpg|80}}
The park's cleanliness is maintained with the help of an ingenious waste disposal system designed by [[Anton Pieck]] and [[Ton van de Ven]], and originally conceived by Henk Knuivers.  There are 11 talking waste disposals.  Children take trash from the ground, and stuff it in the disposals to hear the gobbler talk.  The most popular gobbler, Hollow Bulging Gijs, makes a gobbling sound when ‘eating’ garbage and thanks the donor politely, whereas Captain Gijs fires a cannon to illustrate his enthusiasm for the guests' tidiness. However, Captain Gijs and the cannon have been removed as to make place for the fairytale Pinocchio.

==Fairy tale scenes==

===Sleeping Beauty===
{{double image|right|Kasteeltje.jpg|180|doornroosje.jpg|180|Castle of...|...Sleeping beauty}}
Designed by [[Anton Pieck]] &amp; [[Ton van de Ven]] as ''Doornroosje''.

[[Sleeping Beauty]]'s castle was built in 1952.  The rooms were decorated and [[Sleeping Beauty]], a sleeping guard, and two sleeping cooks were introduced the following year.  Instead of climbing roses, faster growing [[evergreen]] [[ivy]] was used to partially cover the castle.  The castle was completely renovated in 1981.  The poles and chicken wire with plaster were replaced by bricks.  An extra [[animatronic]] scene of the wicked witch spinning yarn was added.  Also in 1981, the sleeping guard was renewed, and again in 1997.  Visitors cannot enter the rooms of the castle, but instead look through the windows to see the various scenes. Both the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Charles Perrault]] have written versions of the tale. The story is about a young maiden; who has been cursed by an evil fairy at birth and fell into an enchanted eternal sleep, and awaken by the kiss of a prince.
 
Since 1999, a book with the tale of [[Sleeping Beauty]] can be read near the entrance in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]].

===Herald Square===
{{double image|right|Herautenplein Efteling.jpg|200|Efteling Herautenplein.jpg|140|Herald square}}
Designed by Pieck &amp; [[Henny Knoet]] as ''Herautenplein''.

Herald Square is the beautiful central square of the Fairy Tale Forest, built in 1952.  The nostalgic gate, the magic clock and the fountain create a [[picturesque]] environment.  The original name was ‘Castle Square’, but the stone princes blowing their horns were confused with [[heralds]], so the name was changed to ‘Herald Square’.

===The Frog King===
Based on [[The Frog Prince]], the scene was designed by Pieck as ''de Kikkerkoning''.

===Snow White===
[[Image:Sneeuwwitje_2018.jpg|left|200px|thumb|''Sneeuwwitje'']]
Designed by Pieck, Van de Ven and Knoet as ''Sneeuwwitje''. Renovated in 1975.

[[Snow White]] first stood in a cave with a hole so you could watch it from outside, with seven stone dwarfs crying over her sleeping death.  Then later, the cave was renewed, and the stone dwarfs were replaced by moving animatronics.  Snow White remained the same, sleeping in a glass box. In 1999, the castle's stepmother appeared in a mirror, with her holographic reflection. In 2018, the cave went down for a major refurbishment, the dwarfs got new clothes, the scenes were renewed and the lighting was updated.

===The Magic Clock===
[[Image:Magische klok.JPG|right|100px|''the Six Princes'']]
Designed as ''de Magische Klok'', it depicts one of Efteling’s own fairy tales.  Every quarter of an hour, the magic clock comes to life and its characters tell us the story. The six princes are animatronics.
In 2012, the animatronics were renewed.

===Dwarf Village===
{{double image|left|Kabouterdorp.JPG|140|kabouterdeur.jpg|120|''the Dwarf Village''|Yanking the dwarf’s chain}}
Dwarf Village was originally designed by Anton Pieck with later contributions by Ton van de Ven.  In 1952, the village consisted of three large toadstools, through which children could walk, with miniature adornments, such as little chairs and dwarf laundry hanging from a wire.  Later additions included a large inhabited dwarf house in 1972, and a hollow tree with a dwarf playing a [[clavichord]] in 1974.  The village was completed by a toadstool with a writing dwarf and a house with a waterwheel belonging to a dwarf-couple in 1980.  During the 1980s, the male dwarf received spoken lines.

In 2017, the three large toadstools went down for a refurbishment.
The toadstools will be rebuilt with modern materials.

===The Six Servants===
[[Image:Langenek Efteling1.JPG|110px|thumb|right|''Langnek'', one of the six servants]]
Designed originally by Anton Pieck, with later contributions of Ton van de Ven.  The original Long-neck (one of the six servants from the Grimm tale, ''[[The Six Servants]]'', who could see everything due to his long neck and sharp eyes) was built in 1952.  In 1955, a little pond was dug around the stone on which Long-neck sits.  A bust of Bullet-eye with a wasp on his nose stood next to Long-neck.  Bullet-eye was one of the six servants.

In the late 1950s, Bullet-eye was removed and a smaller bust of a blindfolded Bullet-eye was placed upon a [[kiosk]] near Long-neck.  Long-neck received a new head in the 1970s; and in 1979, his body and neck were renewed.  In 2006, safety-fences were placed near the pond. In 2013, the rocks were remodeled and Long-neck received a new head again.

The tale is voiced by Peter Reijnders, and can be read from a book in Dutch, English, French and German.

===The Chinese Nightingale===
[[Image:Chinese Nachtegaal.jpg|right|130px|thumb]]
Designed by Pieck and Van de Ven as ''De Chinese Nachtegaal''.

The scene from [[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]] shows the emperor's death, and how the [[nightingale]] restores his life by singing.
The nightingale was one of the first fairy tales when the Fairytale Forest opened in 1952.
Back then, it was just a small scene, with the nightingale on a branch.
In 1979 it got replaced by the Dragon.
In 1999, the new scene opened.
The new scene is much bigger and is located in a building inspired by classic Chinese architecture.

The tale is voiced by Angélique de Boer.

===The Talking Parrot===
The Talking Parrot was one of the ten original scenes from 1952, designed by Anton Pieck.  The tale is about a naughty princess who used to mock people's voices and movements.  She was turned into a [[parrot]] by an old fairy whom she ridiculed. When the girl regrets her sins, the fairy vetoes the spell and "they live happily ever after".  The scene is depicted by the parrot, which records sounds for a few seconds at a time and then plays back any sounds captured on the recording.  The scene was titled "The Naughty Princess" before being renamed to "The Talking Parrot".

===Mother Hulda===
[[Image:Vrouwholle.jpg|right|130px|thumb|''Mother Hulda'']]
Based on [[Mother Hulda|the Grimm tale]], the scene was designed by Pieck as ''Vrouw Holle''.
This story has been depicted, since the park opened, by a well. At the bottom of the well images are projected by Anton Pieck while a voice tells the story.

Since the winter of 2006, [[Mother Hulda]] is present in person with a new animatronic. If called upon, she opens the shutters of the cottage next door and shakes her pillow. And as in the tale, it starts to snow.

===Little Red Riding Hood===
{{double image|right|Efteling 2017 Roodkapje.jpg|80|Efteling Roodkapje.jpg|150|''Little Red Riding Hood''}}
The scene was designed by Anton Pieck.  [[Little Red Riding Hood]] and the wolf entered Efteling in 1953, made of wood, as an outdoor scene.  Little Red Riding Hood knelt in the midst of flowers while the wolf watched her from behind a tree.  In 1960, the scene was replaced by Granny’s house, with the wolf lying in bed and Red Riding Hood at the front door, ringing the bell.  The wooden Little Red Riding Hood would later return to the Fairy Tale Forest as a road-sign.  One can look through the window and listen to the story, told by [[Wieteke van Dort]].

On August 15, 1998, the figure of Little Red Riding Hood was stolen; but was found the next day at the Dominicus Church in [[Tiel]].  During its brief absence, an actress played Little Red Riding Hood in the Fairy Tale Forest.  On October 4, 2006, it was stolen again and found at a retirement home in [[Kaatsheuvel]].

In 2016, the house was rebuilt, with new building techniques.
Also in 2016, the animatronic of the crow Krakeeltje was renewed with new movements.

===The Red Shoes===
{{double image|right|Rode schoentjes efteling.jpg|120|Efteling - Rode Schoentjes.jpg|120|''The Red Shoes''}}
Designed by Anton Pieck, the Dancing Shoes entered Efteling in 1953.  The scene contains a little dance floor with two red shoes dancing, covered by a porch roof.  Visitors can listen to the story, told by Wieteke van Dort, after which the shoes dance to the music of "The [[clogging|Clog]] Dance" by [[Jan van Oort]].

The original story by Hans Christian Andersen has been adapted to be more suitable for young children. In the original story, the girl's feet are cut off to stop her dancing.  In the adaptation, the straps of her shoes are cut, after which the girl can stop dancing, but the shoes keep moving.  The shoes are moved by two rotating discs with [[magnets]], a mechanism developed by Peter Reijnders.

===Hansel and Gretel===
{{double image|right|Hans-en-Grietje.jpg|140|Efteling Hans.jpg|140|The witch's candy hut|Hansel in the cage}}
[[Hansel and Gretel]] was designed by Anton Pieck and presented to the public on June 20, 1955.  The scene consists of the witch's house with candy on the walls, [[pancakes]] as roofing tiles and a cake on top; and in the garden, a fountain of red [[lemonade]].  Gretel sits by the cage in which Hansel is held in the garden.  The witch's face can be seen through a little window in the front door.

In the late seventies, the wood figures were replaced by moving [[animatronic]]s.  An interactive element was added by Peter Reijnders: when one moves the front gate, a [[crow]] on the roof caws, smoke comes out of the chimney, a black cat with yellow eyes comes out of a hole in the wall and the witch (voiced by Peter Reijnder's daughter) says "Knibbel, knabbel, knuisje, wie knabbelt aan mijn huisje?" (Dutch translation of "Nibble, nibble, mousekin, who's nibbling at my housekin?").

In 2016, the animatronics of Hansel and Gretel were replaced by more realistic versions of them.

===The Wishing-Table===
Designed by Pieck and Knoet as ''Tafeltje-dek-je''.

===Guinevere's Bridal Gown===
[[Image:Efteling Het bruidskleed van Genoveva - gekleurde duiven.JPG|160px|right|thumb|Some coloured pigeons]]
Designed as ''Het Bruidskleed van Genoveva''. Presented in the area of Snowwhite as coloured pigeons.
Since June 2018, the pigeons are white instead of coloured.

===The Gardener and the Fakir===
[[Image:Fakir1.JPG|160px|left|thumb|''The Gardener and the Fakir'']]
Designed by Pieck and Van de Ven as ''De Vliegende Fakir''.

The story is staged in front of a building surrounded by an Indian tulip garden. The fakir appears in a window playing his flute, which makes the tulips grow. He then disappears and shows up in the tower with his magic carpet and flies to the other palace tower, using an ingenious system of discreet cables (developed by Peter Reijnders) which gives the illusion of a real levitation.  He plays his flute again to open the tulips there, and in the meanwhile the other tulips close.

The color of the beard of the fakir went from black to white in 1987.

===The Indian Water Lilies===
{{double image|right|Lilies 0001.jpg|180|Indische waterlelies.jpg|200|Square with the [[Indrajit]] Temple Guards|The witch’s chant brings out the fairies}}
[[The Indian Water Lilies]] is a walk-through attraction.  Visitors walk into the show area to experience the three-dimensional tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aquanura water show in the works at Efteling in the Netherlands|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/10/news/la-trb-efteling-aquanura-water-show-01201211|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=3 June 2012|author=Brady MacDonald|date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the very first attraction that made use of advanced techniques to create an artificial, fairy tale-style environment.  The consistency and style of the music, lighting, decorations and [[animatronics]] can be found in many other rides built later, like Spookslot,  [[Fata Morgana (Efteling)|Fata Morgana]] and [[Dreamflight|Droomvlucht]].

[[Peter Reijnders]] wanted to create this ride to commemorate the 15th anniversary of Efteling, and went to the [[Royal Castle of Laeken]] at [[Laeken|Laken]] for an audience with [[Queen Fabiola of Belgium]].  The queen agreed to let the Efteling use her story, which she had published in a book of fairy tales entitled ''Los doce cuentos maravillosos'', on the condition that a contribution to charity was made.

One enters the ride by walking through a cave leading to an Indian temple square with a large fountain, Indian decorations and two [[Indrajit]] giants. Two large gates give access to a cavern leading to a [[subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] [[jungle]] lake, enclosed by tropical plants, a creek and a roaring waterfall. After the introduction tale has been told, the appearance of the singing witch summons the fairies to dance on the water lilies, guided by the music of a frog orchestra and singing geese.

The principal musical theme for The Indian Water Lilies is “Afrikaan Beat” by [[Bert Kaempfert]], but the ride starts with the [[Inca]] chant, “Taita [[Inti]]” (Virgin of the Sun God), taken from the album ''Voice of the [[Xtabay]]'' by [[Yma Sumac]].

===The Little Mermaid===
[[The Little Mermaid]] made her appearance in 1970, designed by Anton Pieck.  She holds a fish that spouts water out of its mouth.  The music is the "Allegro Briljante" by [[François-Adrien Boieldieu]].  The mermaid was renewed in 2001.

===The Wolf and the Seven Kids===
[[Image:Moeder geit.jpg|150px|left|Outside of the house, Mother Goat goes out shopping, while the wolf stalks her little goats.]]
The Seven Little Goats was the last fairy tale to be added by Anton Pieck in 1973.  One can look through the windows of the goats' house.  It consists of a living room and a playing annex bedroom.  Six of the little goats play the [[Game of the Goose]] on a special Efteling-board designed by Anton Pieck.  The youngest goat hides in the big clock.  The big bad wolf, dressed in a tuxedo, is at the front door.  In 2002, a [[squirrel]] was added on top of the roof.

===The Dragon===
{{double image|right|draak efteling.jpg|200|schatkist.jpg|200|The Dragon attacks... |...when guests touch the treasure}}
The Dragon, designed by Anton Pieck and Ton van de Ven, was supposed to open on April 6, 1979.  However, the movements of the dragon’s neck and wings were too staccato, delaying the presentation until June 20, 1979.  The dragon is about seven meters long, with a wing span of four meters, and it weighs about 1000&amp;nbsp;kg, making it the largest [[animatronic]] dragon of its time.  If one tries to steal the crown from the treasure chest in front of the dragon, the dragon starts growling and moving fiercely.  The dragon’s sounds are a mix of the sounds of an angry gorilla and a hissing snake, taken from ''Essential Death And Horror Sound Effects Vol. 1'' by [[BBC]] sound designer Steven Brown.  In 2000, the dragon was upgraded to blow smoke out of its nostrils. The neck of the dragon has been shortened a few times. This was done because people could touch the dragon. There are no specific tales attached to the Dragon.

===The Troll King===
{{double image|right|Trollenkoning_2017.jpg|130|Uil Trollenkoning.jpg|130|The Troll King on his throne in a tree}}
The [[animatronic]] Troll King entered Efteling in 1988, for a total cost of 2.6 million guilders.  Although [[troll]]s are a widespread phenomenon in [[Scandinavian mythology]], no particular tale is attached to the Troll King.  The Scandinavian myths inspired Ton van de Ven, who had illustrated a Norwegian fairy tale book in 1974, to create this old, somewhat confused creature, sitting in a hollow tree, predicting the future of his visitors.

On a stone in front of the king, one can point at one of the twelve [[astrological sign]]s at which the king will wake up and mumble some words. Together with Hugo of [[Villa Volta]], the king is the most complex [[animatronic]] in Efteling.  It was a collaboration of Ton van de Ven, [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] and [[Spitting Image]].  The animatronic can move 26 parts of its body, including eyebrows, eyes, jaws, back and wrists.  Its voice is that of Peter van Ostade, who also composed the music for [[The People of Laaf]].

===Tom Thumb===
{{double image|left|Kleinduimpje Efteling.jpg|130|Klein Duimpje Efteling.jpg|130|''Tom Thumb''}}
Based on [[Tom Thumb|the tale by Perrault]], the scene was designed by Van de Ven as ''Klein Duimpje''.
In the scene, Tom Thumb is stealing the boot of the sleeping giant.
To call Tom Thumb, you have to call his name in a log.

===Rumpelstiltskin===
[[Image:Rumpelstiltskin Efteling.jpg|130px|thumb|right|The soldier listens while ''Rumpelstiltskin'' reveals his name]]
Based on [[Rumpelstiltskin|the Grimm fairy tale]], the scene was designed by Van de Ven as ''Repelsteeltje''.
Guests can look inside Rumpelstiltskin's house through a window while he reveals his name in a song:
''Niemand weet, Niemand weet, Dat ik Repelsteeltje heet!'' [Translation: No one knows, no one knows, That my name is Rumpelstiltskin!]

===Rapunzel===
[[File:Efteling - Raponsje.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The witch climbing down Rapunzel’s hair]]
On May 18, 2001, [[Rapunzel]] made her appearance in Efteling in a 10 meter high tower.  A witch climbs Rapunzel's long hair 7 meters before she climbs down again.  The scene was designed by Ton van de Ven, who was inspired by towers from the Middle Ages.  The story is told by Wieteke van Dort; the witch’s sounds are by Robert-Jaap Jansen, an Efteling designer.

To create some publicity for the official opening, Efteling organized a contest to find the girl with the longest hair from the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Germany]] and the [[UK]].  The winner was Patty Gisbers-Jenniskens from [[Overbetuwe|Heteren]] with a braid of 172 centimeters.  The Flemish winner, Katalin Willems, cut her 134&amp;nbsp;cm long braid later that year and donated her braid to Efteling.

===The Little Match Girl===
{{double image|right|Fairy tale ghost.jpg|130|Het meisje met de zwavelstokjes Efteling.jpg|130|''The Little Match Girl''. Inside and outside of the fairy tale building}}
Based on [[The Little Match Girl|the tale by Hans Christian Andersen]], the scene was designed by Michel den Dulk as ''Het Meisje met de Zwavelstokjes''.
This tale opened during the Winter Efteling in 2004 for the 200th anniversary of the birth of Hans Christian Andersen. It had cost approximately €1,300,000 and is set up as a walkthrough
With the help of special effects, such as holographs, and animatronics, The Little Match Girl is one of the most touching stories.

===Cinderella===
This classic fairy tale was brought to life by [[Karel Willemen]] and entered into the park scene in 2009. It was designed as ''Assepoester''.
The scene takes place inside [[Cinderella]]'s stepmother's house.  In the garden, the grave of Cinderella's real mother is seen, with a tree hanging over it.  The visitors enter the mansion, where they can watch through a window and look into a dark room, where birds are eating beans and a large music box stands in the middle.  During the story, various elements make noise or are shown with a spotlight.  These include a door, where visitors see the shadows of the stepsisters, complaining about Cinderella, and the music box, inside of which figures of Cinderella and the prince are dancing.  Then two animatronics of Cinderella and the prince are shown, with the prince fitting the glass slipper on Cinderella.  Finally, two doors behind the pair open up, revealing a distant castle and a carriage traveling toward it.

===The Fairy Tale Tree===
In 2008, Efteling began to build an interactive tree, ''De Sprookjesboom'', designed by Pim-Martijn Sanders and Karel Willemen, in the Fairy Tale Forest based on the character from their animated TV series ''[[Sprookjesboom]]'', but the plan was unexpectedly shelved until July 2009, opening only on April 1, 2010.  The tree is a wise old oak, which can speak and tell stories, typically about the other inhabitants of the Sprookjesbos.  It consists of 1,500 branches and 50,000 sheets.  The tree has several effects besides speaking: his whole structure - trunk, branches, leaves - move. It is home to several small animatronics, such as a squirrel, a woodpecker, a spider and talking mushrooms.
The old oak is located opposite The Little Match Girl, and is a structure 13 meters wide and 13 meters high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sprookjesboom|url=http://www.sprookjesboom.com/|work=Sprookjesboom|publisher=Eftling|accessdate=3 June 2012|language=Dutch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104002513/http://sprookjesboom.com/|archivedate=4 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Emperor's New Clothes===
[[The Emperor's New Clothes]], designed as ''De Nieuwe kleren van de Keizer'', opened in fall 2012. It is an outdoor fairy tale, and partly uses shadow puppetry to tell the tale. When the emperor is carried to his palace naked, a fountain is used to hide his private parts, which is a comical addition to the attraction.

When the fairy tale opened, it was voiced by Toos van de Voorde-Verdult.
In December 2012, Toos' voice was replaced by Paul van Vliet.

===Pinocchio===
{{double image|left|Anton Pieck muizen.jpg|130|Detail Pinokkio.jpg|130|Geppetto's shop}}
[[Image:Pinokkio Efteling.jpg|150px|right|thumb|''Pinocchio'']]
The fairytale which was revealed to the public on the 24th of March 2016 depicts the story of the puppet who becomes a boy. In fairytale forest Geppetto's shop (designed as "la bottega di Geppetto) is shown desolate and with a note which informs the reader that [[Mister Geppetto|Geppetto]] has left his home looking for [[Pinocchio]]. A few meters to the left of the shop the visitors can see monsterous fish which has devoured both Geppetto and Pinocchio who are visible when in opens its mouth.

The fairy tale was created by the Efteling in association with the'Fondazione Nazionale Carlo Collodi', an organasation from the city of [[Colledi]] which tries to promote the story of Pinocchio. Because of this the fairy tale has typical [[Italy|Italian]] influences.

From 2015 till 2016 a 'Pinocchio' musical was performed in the Efteling theatre to promote the fairy tale that would open around the same time.

==Other Fairytale Forests==
* [[Phantasialand]] also had a fairy tale forest (called the ''Märchenwald'') but it was demolished on 8 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.freizeit-ratgeber.de/node/2735 Phantasialand-Themenbereich am Ende: Der Märchenwald muss weichen!]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also opened an attraction called Fairy Tale Forest; it opened to the public on 17 December 2015.

The '''Gloucestershire flag''', also known as the '''Severn Cross''', was the winning entry in a competition held by the then [[High Sheriff of Gloucestershire]], Jonathan Carr, to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the county in March 2008. Prior to 2008, the [[banner of arms]] for [[Gloucestershire County Council]] was used as the [[de facto]] flag for the county. The new flag is coloured blue, cream and green, representing the [[River Severn]], [[Cotswold stone]] and the [[Golden Valley, Stroud]] respectively. 

==History==
[[File:Gloucestershire banner of the arms.jpg|thumb|Banner of the arms of Gloucestershire County Council]]

Prior to 2008, there was a flag of Gloucestershire available, but was actually the [[banner of arms]] for [[Gloucestershire County Council]] and therefore not the county flag. The new flag was registered in March 2008, and is named the ''Severn Cross''.&lt;ref name=flags&gt;{{cite web|title=Gloucestershire Flag|url=https://britishcountyflags.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/gloucestershire-flag/|website=British County Flags|accessdate=29 August 2016|date=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The design was the winning entry in a 2008 competition, judged by [[High Sheriff of Gloucestershire]], Jonathan Carr, in celebration of a millennium of the county's existence.&lt;ref name=flags/&gt; In addition, Carr stated that many counties of the [[West Country]] had their own flags and this anniversary presented the opportunity to add Gloucestershire's flag. In addition, the winner would take home a prize of £250.&lt;ref name=comp&gt;{{cite news|title=Design a Gloucestershire flag|url=http://www.soglos.com/children/27652/Design-a-Gloucestershire-flag|accessdate=29 August 2016|work=SoGlos|date=29 January 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619002705/http://www.soglos.com/children/27652/Design-a-Gloucestershire-flag|archivedate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The competition had over 1000 entries, and the winning entry was designed by Jeremy Bentail, a mental health worker.&lt;ref name=launch /&gt;The 80 best entries were then displayed at the [[Shire Hall]]. Once the winner had been chosen, the first thirty flags produced were flown by district councils and [[University of Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref name=launch&gt;{{cite news|title=Gloucestershire's new flag launched|url=http://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/gloucestershire-s-new-flag-launched/story-11926288-detail/story.html|accessdate=29 August 2016|work=Gloucestershire Live|date=3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The flag comprises a cross of mid-blue, outlined in cream, against an apple green background. The blue represents the [[River Severn]], the green represents the [[Golden Valley, Stroud]] and the cream represents [[Cotswold stone]].&lt;ref name=launch /&gt;

"'''Frau Holle'''" (also known as "'''Mother Holle'''" or "'''Mother Hulda'''" or "'''Old Mother Frost'''") is a [[German language|German]] [[fairy tale]] that comes from the book ''Kinder- und Hausmärchen'' (''[[Children's and Household Tales]]'')  collected by [[The Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]].&lt;ref name=surlalune&gt;{{cite web|title=Frau Holle (Mother Holle) (A German Tale)|url=http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/diamondstoads/stories/holle.html|website=SurLaLuneFairyTales.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Frau Holle" is the 24th story in the first volume of the book published in 1812 as part of ''Children's and Household Tales''.

==Background==
[[File:Vrouwholle.jpg|thumb|260px|Frau Holle in the [[Efteling]]]]
The legend itself, as it was eventually passed to the Grimm Brothers, originates from oral traditions in [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]] in what is now known as [[Hesse]]. It was told to them by Henriette Dorothea Wild (whom Wilhelm Grimm married in 1825) with more details, which were added in the second edition (1819). It is still a common expression in Hesse and beyond to say "Hulda is making her bed" when it is snowing, that is, she shakes her bed and out comes snow from heaven.

In the second edition of the book in 1819 they added some details, most prominently the rooster's greetings, provided by a correspondent: Georg August Friedrich Goldmann from [[Hanover]].&lt;ref name=Bio.&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilhelm Grimm|url=http://www.biography.com/people/wilhelm-grimm-21085173#grimms-fairy-tales|website=Bio.|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other tales collected by the brothers Grimm the story of Frau Holle was told to teach a moral. In this case, it is that hard work is rewarded and laziness is punished.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Frau Holle - Mauro Breda.jpg|420px|thumb|upright|Frau Holle]]
A rich [[widow]] lives with her daughter and her stepdaughter. The widow favored her younger biological daughter allowing her to become spoiled and idle while her older stepdaughter was left to do all the work. Every day the stepdaughter would sit outside the cottage and [[Weaving (mythology)|spin]] beside the well.

One day she pricked her finger on the point of the [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]]. Leaning over the well to wash the blood away, the spindle fell from her hand and sank out of sight. The stepdaughter feared that she would be punished for losing the spindle, and in a panic she leapt into the well after it.

The girl found herself in a meadow where she came upon an oven full of bread. The bread asked to be taken out before it burned. With a baker's [[Peel (tool)|peel]] she took all the loaves out and then walked on. Then she came to an apple tree that asked that its apples be harvested. So she did so and gathered them into a pile, before continuing on her way. Finally she came to a small house of an old woman, who offered to allow the girl to stay if she would help with the housework.

The woman identified herself as Frau Holle, and cautioned the girl to shake the featherbed pillows and coverlet well when she made the bed, as that would make it snow in the girl's world. The girl agreed to take service with Frau Holle, and took care to always shake the featherbed until the feathers flew about like snowflakes.

After a time, the girl became homesick and told Frau Holle that it was time for her to return home. Frau Holle had been impressed by the girl's kindness and hard work so much that when she escorted the girl to the gate, a shower of [[gold]] fell upon the girl. She also gave her the spindle which had fallen into the well. With that the gate was closed, and the girl found herself back, not far from her mother's house. 

Her mother wished the same good fortune for her biological daughter. She also set her to sit by the well and spin, but the girl deliberately threw the spindle into the well before jumping in herself. She too came to the oven, but would not assist the bread; nor would she help the apple tree. When she came to Frau Holle's house, she likewise took service there, but before long fell into her lazy, careless ways. Frau Holle soon dismissed her. As the lazy girl stood at the gate, a kettle of [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] spilled over her. "That is what you have earned," said Frau Holle, and closed the gate.

Other versions describe the first girl having a piece of gold fall from her lips every time she speaks whilst the second has a toad fall from her lips everytime she speaks.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; That is why, in [[Hessen]] whenever it snows they say that Frau Holle is making her bed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm024.html ''Frau Holle'', translated by D.L. Ashliman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Marija Gimbutas]] names Hulda (or [[Holda]], Holla, Holle) as having originally been an ancient Germanic supreme goddess who predates most of the Germanic pantheon, including deities such as [[Odin]], [[Thor]], [[Freya]], and [[Loki]], continuing traditions of [[Old European culture|pre-Indo-European]] [[Neolithic Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Gimbutas, Marija, ''The Living Goddesses'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; 

As Christianity slowly replaced Scandinavian paganism during the [[Early Middle Ages]], many of the old customs were gradually lost or assimilated into Christian tradition. By the end of the [[High Middle Ages]], Scandinavian paganism was almost completely marginalized and blended into rural [[folklore]], in which the character of Frau Hulda eventually survived.

In Germanic Pre-Christian folklore, Hulda, [[Holda]], Holle and Holla were all names to denote a single being. According to [[Erika Timm]], Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably Celtic, traditions of the Alpine regions after the [[Migration Period]] in the Early Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Timm, Erika. 2003. Frau Holle, Frau Percht und verwandte Gestalten: 160 Jahre nach Grimm aus germanistischer Sicht betrachtet.&lt;/ref&gt; Hulda is also related to the Germanic figure of [[Perchta]]. She dwells at the bottom of a well, rides a wagon, and  first taught the craft of making linen from flax. Holle is the goddess to whom children who died as infants go, and alternatively known as both the Dunkle Großmutter (Dark Grandmother) and the ''Weisse Frau'' (White Lady), elements which are more typically associated with the Grimms' fairy tale as well. Her connection to the spirit world through the magic of spinning and [[Weaving (mythology)|weaving]] has associated her with [[witchcraft]] in Catholic German folklore.

Frau Holle is one of Germany's most durable female legendary figures and represents a pre-Christian deity who survived in popular belief and in the memory of common people well into the nineteenth century.

==Perchta==
{{Main|Perchta}}

The Grimms say Perchta or Berchta was known "precisely in those Upper German regions where Holda leaves off, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria and Austria."&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, Jacob (1882). Deutsche Mythologie 4th ed. [1875]. Trans. James Stallybrass Grimm's Teutonic Mythology Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Jacob Grimm (1882), Perchta was spoken of in Old High German in the 10th century as Frau Berchta and thought to be a white-robed female spirit. She was known as a goddess who oversaw spinning and weaving, like myths of Holda in Continental German regions. He believes she was the feminine equivalent of Berchtold, and she was sometimes the leader of the [[Wild Hunt]].

According to Erika Timm, Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably Celtic, traditions of the Alpine regions after the Migration Period in the Early Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Timm, Erika. 2003. Frau Holle, Frau Percht und verwandte Gestalten: 160 Jahre nach Grimm aus germanistischer Sicht betrachtet.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Like many of the other tales collected by the Grimm brothers, "Frau Holle" personifies good behavior and bad, and the appropriate reward meted out for each.  Even so, it also exhibits a number of contrasts with other stories.  Typically, the magical beings who appear in the tales must enter the real world and appear to the protagonists before any intercession can take place.  Moreover, these beings are almost always anonymous and therefore difficult to correlate with figures in pre-Christian mythology.  By contrast, Frau Holle resides somewhere above the earth, and the protagonists must go to her, paradoxically by diving into a spring.  When she makes her bed, loose feathers are 'stirred up' and fall to earth as snow, and so this fairy tale is an origin myth as well.  Comparison between Frau Holle and a weather or earth goddess is inevitable.  Jakob Grimm&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Ludwig Karl Grimm, transl J.S. Stallybrass.''[[Deutsche Mythologie|Teutonic Mythology]]''. George Bell, London 1882, pp 263f.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Thunar ([[Thor]]) makes rain in a similar fashion, implying for Frau Holle a very high rank in the pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm (1882) p268&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though not unique in this respect, the Frau Holle story is also notable for the absence of class-related motifs such as palaces,  balls to which one may or may not be invited, and the rise to the status of the [[nobility]] through marriage.

According to the [[Aarne–Thompson classification systems|Aarne and Thompson classification system of fairy tales]], ''Mother Hulda'' is a story of type 480, ''The Kind and the Unkind Girls''.  Others of this type include ''[[Shita-kiri Suzume]]'', ''[[Diamonds and Toads]]'', ''[[The Three Heads in the Well]]'', ''[[Father Frost (fairy tale)|Father Frost]]'', ''[[The Three Little Men in the Wood]]'', ''[[The Enchanted Wreath]]'', ''[[The Old Witch]]'', and ''[[The Two Caskets]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/diamondstoads/other.html "Tales Similar to Diamonds and Toads"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Literary variants include ''[[The Three Fairies]]'' and ''[[Aurore and Aimée]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 543, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fugitive pigments''' are [[wikt:impermanent|impermanent]] [[pigment]]s that lighten, darken, or otherwise change in appearance or physicality over time when exposed to certain environmental conditions, such as light, temperature, humidity, or pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Field|first=George|title=Field's Chromatography or Treatise on Colours and Pigments as Used by Artists|year=1869|publisher=Project Guttenberg|location=London|page=31|url=http://www.gutenberg.org|edition=Salter's|editor=Thomas W.

Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|page=59|url=http://www.getty.edu|author=Tiarna Doherty|edition=Revised|author2=Anne T. Woollett}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fugitive pigments are present in types of [[paint]], [[Marker pen|marker]]s, [[ink]]s etc., which are used for temporary applications. Fugitive inks which washed away when soaked in water were sometimes used deliberately to prevent [[postage stamp]]s being removed from envelopes by soaking, and reused (e.g., the [[Queen Victoria Lilac and Green Issue]]).

While permanent pigments are usually used for [[painting]]s, painters have made work wholly or partially with fugitive pigments for a number of reasons: availability and cost of pigments; being more concerned with the appearance of colors available only with fugitive pigments than with permanence; ignorance regarding the volatility of the pigments; or the desire to have a painting change in appearance over time.

== Plot ==
The main character in the film is a teenager named Lyoscha - enthusiastic computer games player, spending all his time in special clubs. Following his passion, he almost did not pay attention to others: neither to his mother, who was distressed by the fact that her son had dropped out of studies, nor to his girlfriend Katya, who was in love with him, nor to any of his friends. In an environment of professional gamers Lyoscha becomes one of the best, followed by victories in multiple competitions. In an effort to become the best he embarks on an international gaming tournament in [[Los Angeles]], but he takes only the second place. After returning home, Lyoscha gets rid of his gaming devices, and for the first time during the entire film, a smile appears on his face.&lt;ref name="Абдуллаева"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Венжер"/&gt;

'''''Glory Road''''' is a 2006 American [[Sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by James Gartner, based on a true story surrounding the events leading to the [[1966 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1966 NCAA University Division Basketball Championship]] (the historic name for what is now known as the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]). [[Don Haskins]] portrayed by [[Josh Lucas]], head coach of [[University of Texas at El Paso|Texas Western College]], coached [[1965–66 Texas Western Miners basketball team|a team]] with an all-[[African Americans|black]] starting lineup, a first in [[NCAA]] history. ''Glory Road'' explores racism, discrimination, and student athletics. Supporting actors [[Jon Voight]] and [[Derek Luke (actor)|Derek Luke]] also star in principal roles.

The film was a co-production between the motion picture studios of [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[Jerry Bruckheimer Films]], Texas Western Productions, and Glory Road Productions. It was commercially distributed by Buena Vista Pictures theatrically and by the Buena Vista Home Entertainment division for the video rental market. It premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on January 13, 2006, grossing $42,938,449 in box office business despite generally mixed reviews from critics. ''Glory Road'' was nominated for a number of awards including the [[Humanitas Prize]]; the film won the 2006 [[ESPY Award]] for ''Best Sports Movie''.

On January 10, 2006, the original motion picture soundtrack was released by the [[Hollywood Records]] music label. The soundtrack was composed and orchestrated by musician [[Trevor Rabin]]. The DVD release, featuring theatrical trailers, extended interviews with players and colleagues of coach Haskins, and deleted scenes, among other highlights, was released in the U.S. on June 6, 2006.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
Newly appointed men's basketball coach Don Haskins gets a new job at Texas Western College in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]. Lacking necessary financial resources, he makes an effort to recruit the best players regardless of race to form a team that can compete for a national championship. Some of the young men he brings in possess skill, but are raw in talent when it comes to organized teamwork focusing on defense and ball distribution. In the end, his Texas Western Miners team comprises seven black and five white athletes; a balance that raises eyebrows among university personnel. Haskins puts his players through a rigorous training program, threatening to cut anyone who doesn't work as hard as he demands, while trying to integrate his players into a single team with a common goal.

Following initial victories against mediocre local teams, Haskins quickly discovers that he has to give his black players more free room on the court. Yet, the more victories his team achieves with its flamboyant style, up until this point rarely seen in college basketball, the more racial hatred mounts on his squad. This culminates in threats to his own family, the beating of a player while on the road and ultimately the vandalism of his team's motel rooms by racists while they are at an away game. Increasingly frightened, the team loses its last game of the regular season after the black players stop playing with passion. Thus, the Texas Western Miners finish the 1965-66 regular season with a 23–1 record, entering the 1966 NCAA tournament ranked third in the nation.

Going on to the [[1966 NCAA University Division Basketball Championship Game|NCAA final]], played at [[College Park, Maryland]], they take on the top-ranked [[1965–66 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|University of Kentucky]] under legendary coach, [[Adolph Rupp]]. Rupp, with a well-organized and more experienced all-white [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Wildcats]] squad, firmly believes that his opponent stands no chance. On the eve of the decisive game, Haskins decides to experiment with a bold strategy, informing his team that he intends to start an all-black lineup in the game, and also only using the two other black players in the rotation.

In the midst of seemingly insurmountable odds, Texas Western encounters mounting problems with [[forward (basketball)|forward]] and team captain Harry Flournoy leaving the game with an injury, and their center David Lattin in foul trouble. In a close game, the Miners narrowly lead at halftime, but finally manage to beat Kentucky 72–65 with some impressive [[steal (basketball)|steals]], rebounding and passing techniques in the second half. The film ends with the players exiting the plane that brought them back to El Paso to the greeting of a raucous crowd.

==Production==

===Development===

''Glory Road'' was inspired by a true story, as described by Texas Western's head coach [[Don Haskins]] in his autobiography of the same title, a national bestseller released in 2005 by [[Hyperion Books]]. The book details Haskins' early life as a player (including a one-on-one game against a black friend that opened his eyes) and women's basketball coach. Like the film, it then focuses on the 1966 Texas Western men's basketball team and the aftermath of the championship. It was reprinted five times in its first four months of release and was selected as an "Editor's Choice" by the New York Times Book Review. Additionally, ''Glory Road'' is the name of a street on the UTEP campus near the [[Sun Bowl]] which was renamed to commemorate the 1966 NCAA championship.

Later asked about his decision to start five black players, Haskins downplayed the significance of his decision. "I really didn't think about starting five black guys. I just wanted to put my five best guys on the court. I just wanted to win the game."&lt;ref&gt;Limón, Iliana. [http://www.abqtrib.com/albq/sports/article/0,2564,ALBQ_19879_4382982,00.html "Ex-Miners coach Don Haskins wasn't playing the hero during a racially charged 1966 championship, but Hollywood doesn't seem to mind."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403063757/http://www.abqtrib.com/albq/sports/article/0%2C2564%2CALBQ_19879_4382982%2C00.html |date=2007-04-03 }} ''Albuquerque Tribune''. 11 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Though credited with setting in motion the [[desegregation]] of college basketball teams in the [[American South|South]], he wrote in his book "I certainly did not expect to be some racial pioneer or change the world."&lt;ref&gt;Haskins, Don with Dan Wetzel. ''Glory Road''. New York:Hyperion, 2006. {{ISBN|1-4013-0791-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunking was banned in the NCAA from 1967 to 1976, not least due to the success of the Texas Western team and a UCLA player named Lew Alcindor (better known later as [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]) then entering the league.

Next to the [[closing credits]], scenes from interviews with some of the real-life players from the team are shown, including one player from the opposing [[University of Kentucky]] team beaten by Texas Western in the NCAA finals, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] head coach [[Pat Riley]]. The real-life Don Haskins was cast as an extra in the film as a gas station attendant, and David Lattin was cast as an extra as a military bartender.

The players on the 1966 team were [[David Lattin]], [[Bobby Joe Hill]], [[Willie Cager]], [[Willie Worsley]], Jerry Armstrong, [[Orsten Artis]], [[Nevil Shed]], [[Harry Flournoy]], Togo Railey, Louis Baudoin, Dick Myers,and David Palacio.
The team was nominated in its entirety for the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]], and was inducted on September 7, 2007, ten years after coach Don Haskins had already been enshrined.

The movie skipped a crucial game that Texas Western had played. On March 18, 1966, the Miners defeated Utah 85-78 in the Final Four to advance to the national championship game the following night. In the movie the team played against Kansas in the regional final and the following game was the national championship, which is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/postseason/1966-ncaa.html|title=1966 NCAA Tournament Summary - College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|website=College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Several scenes in this movie were filmed at the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] (UTEP), which is the former Texas Western College, and [[El Paso High School]] in [[El Paso, Texas]]. Other scenes were filmed at [[Southeastern Louisiana University]] in [[Hammond, Louisiana]], [[Jesuit High School (New Orleans)|Jesuit High School]] and Douglas High School, formerly F. T. Nicholls High School, in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], and [[Chalmette High School]] in [[Chalmette, Louisiana]]. The [[IHOP]] scene was filmed in the old Airline Motors Diner on [[Airline Highway]] just west of New Orleans. The school shown for the girls' basketball game in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] at the beginning of the film is actually the front of El Paso High School, as shown by the engraving on the top of the columns. The lunchroom basketball trash can scene was filmed at Booker T. Washington High School, the first high school built in New Orleans for African-Americans. Towards the beginning of the film for the shot of Texas Western College, the [[Wells Fargo Plaza (El Paso)|Wells Fargo Plaza]] and the Chase Bank Building in downtown El Paso can be seen in the top left corner. The Wells Fargo Plaza was not completed until 1971, and the Chase Bank Building was still the Texas Commerce Bank building until the early 1990s. In addition, [[Ralph Strangis]] (the former [[Dallas Stars]] play-by-play announcer) had a small speaking role as a courtside broadcaster. [[Ben Affleck]] was the original choice for the role of coach Don Haskins, but had to drop out of the filming due to prior commitments. [[NBA]] point guard [[Kirk Hinrich]] was offered a role in the film, but chose not to participate "because of time constraints".&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Smith (journalist)|Sam Smith]]. "Skiles lauds Chandler's play; Coach calls game 7-footer's best yet". ''Chicago Tribune''. November 21, 2005. Sports, pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

During the scene of the Texas Western-[[Seattle Redhawks men's basketball|Seattle University]] basketball game broadcast the announcers inadvertently used the call letters [[WTSM]], which is an  FM radio sports station from Tallahassee, Florida instead of the El Paso station [[KTSM-AM]].

===Controversy===
Kentucky Wildcat fans and other Rupp supporters said the film at least implicitly portrayed UK coach Adolph Rupp as a racist, with such lines as Bobby Joe Hill's that Rupp would not have recruited him. Like other teams in the Southeastern Conference, Kentucky was indeed all-white, but they were the first (and for about a decade, the only) SEC team to regularly play (inter-conference) opponents with black players (starting in the 1950s) and, in fact, took the place of Alabama (1956) and Mississippi State (1959, 1961) in the NCAA Tournament after their respective state legislatures and/or university leadership refused the invitations because of the possibility of playing against integrated squads.[http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/rupp.html#evidencepro] Starting in 1964, Rupp had recruited Kentuckians [[Wes Unseld]] and [[Butch Beard]] along with eight other black players who received formal scholarship offers before [[Tom Payne (basketball)|Tom Payne]] in 1969 became UK's first black player.[http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/rupp.html#evidencepro] But while doing so he told them (just as [[Branch Rickey]] did to [[Jackie Robinson]] about the racial difficulties they could expect in playing in the SEC and Unseld and Beard went to [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] instead. 

In the game between [[Texas A&amp;M–Commerce Lions men's basketball|East Texas State University]], now known as [[Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce]], and Texas Western, East Texas State fans are shown throwing popcorn and drinks, and yelling [[racial epithet]]s. In a later scene, racial slurs are shown painted onto the hotel rooms of the black Texas Western players.

The''' history of the book''' in [[Brazil]] focuses on the development of the access to publishing resources and acquisition of the book in the country, covering a period extending from the beginning of the editorial activity during colonization to today's publishing market, including the history of [[publishing]] and [[bookstores]] that allowed the modern accessibility to the book.

== Colonial Period ==
It is believed that [[printing]] was only introduced by the settlers and colonisers in the colonies, which had a highly developed indigenous culture that the colonial power wanted to supplant or suppress. This idea is supported by the Brazilian historian [[Nelson Werneck Sodré]]&lt;ref&gt;SODRÉ, Nelson Werneck, 1970, p. 291-293.&lt;/ref&gt;  and others. Printing, in the first two centuries of Portuguese and Spanish colonization, was in part a result of [[Christian evangelization]]. It was deployed through religious initiative, so that its production was destined to meet the clergy's needs and that of the missions.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Patiosantoinacio.jpg|right|thumb|200x200px|[http://www.santoinacio-rio.com.br/s/ Colégio Santo Inácio] (St. Ignatius College) is believed to have crafted the first printed works in Brazil, in 1724.]]
"História da Companhia de Jesus no Brasil", by Serafim Leite,&lt;ref name="Hallewell, 1985, p. 10"&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; says that the library of [http://www.santoinacio-rio.com.br/s/ Colégio Santo Inácio], in O Morro do Castelo, [[Rio de Janeiro]]. (This was a landform that existed in the city of Rio, the hill being one of the foundation points of the city in the sixteenth century and which housed landmarks of great importance, such as colonial forts and buildings of the Jesuits. Nevertheless, it was destroyed in an urban reform in 1922.) This centre is believed to have undertaken some printed jobs around 1724, the accuracy of the claim not be ascertained. It could be referring to two books of the time, "Vocabulário de la lengua guarany", by [[Antônio Luiz Restrepo]] (1722), and "Arte de la lengua guarany", which were printed in a region that is currently part of Brazil, but which at the time belonged to [[Paraguay]], [[Pueblo de Santa Maria la Mayor]].&lt;ref name="Hallewell, 1985, p. 10"&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In most colonies, the necessities of governance made it an imperative to accept printing, and only in [[Portuguese Latin America]] did the administration remained so elementary that this need was dispensed with. This need only become imminent when the government of the colony suffered the impact of the Napoleonic invasion, a few years later.

The first attempt to introduce effective printing into Brazil was made by the Dutch, during the period of their occupation of northeastern Brazil, between 1630 and 1650.

During the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] occupation, negotiations between [[Pernambuco]] and the [[Netherlands]] resulted in the selection of a printer, [[Janszonon Pieter]], to be in charge of printing in [[Recife]], but he died as soon as he arrived in Brazil on 3 August 1643.&lt;ref&gt;TAUNAY, Afonso d’Escragnolle, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the [[Dutch West Indies Company]] was still looking out for a printer without success. At the time, [[Maurice of Nassau]] had already left, and the pressured Dutch no longer gave priority to the subject.

== The start of publishing activity ==
About 60 years later, [[Recife]] had the first printer of Brazil according to historians [[Ferreira de Carvalho]]&lt;ref&gt;CARVALHO, Alfredo Ferreira de, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pereira da Costa]],&lt;ref&gt;COSTA, Francisco Agusto Pereira da, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; but the identity of the printer is not known. [[Serafim Leite]], in "Arts and Workshops of the Jesuits in Brazil,",&lt;ref name="Hallewell, 1985, p. 14"&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; says the printer worked from 1703 to 1706, and argues that the typesetter was a Jesuit, Antonio da Costa, but there is no proof, however, the existence of such a printer.

In Rio de Janeiro, in 1747, there is definitive evidence is available that there was a printer, via leaflets printed at the time. The printer was [[Antonio Isidoro da Fonseca]],&lt;ref name="Hallewell, 1985, p. 14"&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; a recognized typographer of [[Lisbon]], who had sold his business and come to [Brazil]. Isidoro had problems in [[Lisbon]], with the [[Inquisition]], being considered as "The [[Jew]]" editor. Antonio Jose da Silva, of [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]], was born in 1703 from a family of converted Jews, and that turned out to be burned later in an [[Auto-da-fé|auto de fé]] of the [[Inquisition]] on 19 October 1739.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the governor of [Rio de Janeiro] and [Minas Gerais], [[Gomes Freire de Andrade]], was interested in stimulating the intellectual life of the city of Rio de Janeiro. He encouraged the creation of [[Academia dos felizes]] in 1736, which became the [[Academia dos Selectos]] in 1752, which met at the Palácio do Governo itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete proof of the existence of printing was a leaflet, 1747, whose authorship is attributed to [[Luiz Antonio Rosado]], and a so-called volume "[[Hoc est Conclusiones real entity Metaphysicae, praeside RGM Francisco de Faria]]" in 1747. There are two other works, referring to bishop [Antonio do Desterro Malheyro]. As soon as the news reached Lisbon, however, there was order to close the letterpress, because printing in the colony was not considered appropriate at the time.

Isidoro returned to Portugal, and, after three years, requested a royal license to reinstate himself as a printer in the colony, in Rio de Janeiro or Salvador, promising never to print without the appropriate civil and ecclesiastical licenses. The request was rejected
&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal's prohibition of printing in Brazil was the factor that made all Brazilian documents to get to be published in Europe or to remain in the form of manuscripts. There are several papers written by Brazilians and printed in Portugal at the time, including the poetry of [[Claudio Manuel da Costa]], the work of [[Santa Rita Durão|José de Santa Rita Durão]], [[Jose Basilio da Gama]] (author of "Uruguay", 1769), [[Tomas Antonio Gonzaga]] (whose work [[Marília de Dirceu]] was published in four editions in Lisbon between 1792 and 1800).

In 1792, there were only two bookstores in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]],&lt;ref&gt;MACARTNEY, George, 1792- 1793.&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly one of these was run by Paul Martim, a native of [[Tours]] (in [[France]]) and the first [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]] bookseller. His son, [[Paul Martim Filho]] kept the bookstore running until 1823. The books offered were usually pertaining to medicine or religion, and most of the books that arrived in Brazil at the time were smuggled in.

== Arrival of the royal family in Brazil ==
[[File:António_de_Araújo_e_Azevedo,_conde_da_Barca.jpg|right|thumb|184x184px|[[António de Araújo e Azevedo, 1st Count of Barca|António de Araújo e Azevedo]], Count of Barca, who had installed the first printing press in Brazil in his own home, in Rio de Janeiro.]]
In 1808, when the royal family, under pressure from Napoleon's invasion, moved to Brazil, it took with them 60,000 volumes of the Royal Library.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Installed in the new capital, [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[John VI of Portugal|Dom João VI]] and his ministers created, among other developments, the Royal Library, now the National Library ([[National Library of Brazil|Biblioteca Nacional]]), which was established in 1810. The impact of this development caused an increase in the number of bookstores, with two existing in 1808 (those of Paul Martin and Manuel Jorge da Silva) growing to five in 1809 (in addition to the above, those run by Francisco Luiz Saturnino da Veiga, Manuel Mandillo—which after 1814 was associated with José Norges Pine—and João Roberto Bourgeois); seven in 1812 (in addition to the previous, Manuel Joaquim da Silva Porto—which in 1815 was associated with Pedro Antonio Campos Bellos—and Jose Antonio da Silva); 12 in 1816 (the additional ones being those of Fernando José Pinheiro, Jeronimo Gonçalves Guimarães, Francisco José Nicolau Mandillo, Joao Batista dos Santos), and in 1818, 3 more (Antonio Joaquim da Silva Garcez, João Lopes de Oliveira Guimarães and Manuel Monteiro Trindade Coelho).&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper [[Correio Braziliense (1808)|Correio Braziliense]]", run by [[Hipólito da Costa|Hipólito José da Costa Pereira Furtado de Mendonça]], was produced in England. In Paris, there was a development of the publishing trade in Portuguese, that would last a long time, almost until 1930.

There is disagreement over whether or not a printing press existed in Brazil on the occasion of the arrival of the royal family. Reportedly, a press with movable type was finally brought to Brazil by the government itself, which had earlier been forbidden so vehemently. [[António de Araújo e Azevedo, 1st Count of Barca|António de Araújo e Azevedo]], then Foreign Minister and later Count of Barca, brought and had installed the press in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], on the ground floor of his own home, 44 [[Rua do Passeio]]. Brother José Mariano da Conceição Veloso, a miner religious who had been to [[Lisbon]] in 1790, returned to [[Brazil]] with the royal family to work in the press of Rio, the [[Imprensa Régia]]. The new press was launched on May 13, 1808, with the publication of a 27 page booklet, accompanied by the [[Royal Charter]]. In the 14 years of the [[printing monopoly]] in Rio over a thousand items were produced.
&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing in the province ==
* '''Minas Gerais'''
The first book printed in the province was in [[Vila Rica]], [[Minas Gerais]], later [[Ouro Preto]], in 1807, before the rise of the Royal Press ([[Imprensa Régia]]). Governor [[Pedro Maria Xavier de Ataíde e Melo|Athayde de Mello]], the future [[Earl of Condeixa]], was so pleased with a poem in his honor by [[Diogo de Vasconcelos]], who wished to see it printed. This impression was made by Father José Joaquim Viegas de Menezes, in a small press for domestic purposes. Associated with the Portuguese Manuel José Barbosa Pimenta e Sal, he gradually set up the "[[Typographia Patriota de Barbosa &amp; Cia]]", which was completed in 1821.

After 1807, the first books printed in [[Ouro Preto]] were a collection of "Laws of the Empire of Brazil" ([[Leis do Império do Brasil]]) in 1835 by a printer called Silva, and the "Dictionary of the Brazilian language" ([[Diccionario da Língua Brasileira]]), by Luis Maria da Silva Pinto in 1832. Later, other printing houses emerged in [[São João del Rei]] (1827), Diamantina (1828) and Marian (1830).&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bahia'''
[[File:Clóvis_Bevilaqua_(catedátrico_de_Legislação_Comparada_1891-1895,_Faculdade_de_Direito_do_Recife)._(Col._Francisco_Rodrigues_FR-1037).jpg|right|thumb|321x321px|[[Clóvis Beviláqua|Clóvis Bevilaqua]], owner of J. L. da Fonseca bookshop, of the School of Law in [[Recife]] between the years 1891 and 1895. Photograph by [[Alberto Henschel]].]]
In Bahia, as soon as the royal family came to [[Brazil]], a bookseller from [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], Manuel Antonio da Silva Serva, a native of Portugal, asked permission to go to England and get a printer to Bahia; such permission was granted in 1809, and began printing in 1811. One might speculate that there were two printers at that time. Serva died in 1819, and the press continued with his partner and son-in-law José Teixeira and Carvalho, becoming known as "Typographia da Viúva Serva, e Carvalho." Later, his son Manuel started working at the firm. The publication known as Silva Serva had 176 titles, and the publisher survived with several name changes until 1846, but lost its monopoly position in 1823. During the struggle for independence in Brazil, the troops of the joint pro-Portugal junta invaded "Typographia da Viúva Serva" to stop the publication of the nationalist newspaper "Constitucional". Its editors fled to [[Cachoeira]], where they installed their own graphics to continue printing the weekly "O Independente Constitucional".&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The Serva press continued producing the [[Gazeta da Bahia]], which was pro-Portugal, but when the nationalist cause triumphed in June 1823, its publication had to be stopped.

With the death of Silva Serva, Bahia's literary production went into decline, only recovering in the 1890s. Standing out, at the time, were  "Livraria J. L. da Fonseca Magalhães, editores," of the lawyer [[Clóvis Beviláqua|Clovis Bevilacqua]] between 1895 and 1910, and [[Livraria Catilina]], founded by Carlos Pongetti on February 2, 1835, and which lasted until 1960, when it became the oldest bookstore in Brazil. In 1864, Sierra Teriga took over its direction, passing it to Xavier Catiline in 1877. The Catilina was a retail house, but had an impressive editorial stint, under the Romualdo dos Santos, and published works of [[Castro Alves]], [[Coelho Neto]], [[Rui Barbosa|Ruy Barbosa]], [[Xavier Marques]], and [[Ernesto Carneiro Ribeiro]]. The actual printing, however, was usually undertaken in Portugal or other European countries, as was customary at the time.
* '''Maranhão'''
[[Maranhão]] was one of the first provinces to have a printing press. It was one of the most prosperous of the empire, due to the production of cotton, which held value since the invention of Cartwright loom in 1787. During this period of development, there was a golden age cultural and intellectual activity in the region, under the influence of the Portuguese elite. The golden age of literature begins with the appearance of the first of [[Gonçalves Dias]] poems, in the 1840s, and goes on to the departure of [[Aluísio Azevedo]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]], in the early 1880. Two printers stand out at this time: Belarmino de Mattos and José Maria Corrêa de Frias.

Printing was introduced in Maranhão in 1821, by the governor of [[Bernardo Silveira Pinto da Fonseca]], when he installed an official printer to produce the government newspaper "Conciliador&amp;#x20;do&amp;#x20;Maranhão."&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; A pre "Columbian", the most modern of the time, was brought in from [[Lisbon]], and then converted into the  "[[Typographia Nacional Maranhense]]" later called "Typographia Nacional Imperial".

The first privately owned printer in [[Maranhao|Maranhão]] was Ricardo Antonio Rodrigues de Araújo, whose enterprise existed from 1822 until the 1850s, and "Typographia Melandiana" of Daniel G. de Melo, who produced his first job in 1825. Most important, however, was the "Typographia Constitucional" of Clementino José Lisboa, which began in 1830. Others were the "Ignacio Jose Ferreira", founded in 1833 by João Francisco Lisboa and Frederico Magno d'Abranches; the "J. G. Magalhães Pereira e Manuel Ramos "; the "Typographia Temperança" of Francisco de Sales Nines Cascais; the "Typographia Monárquica Constitucional" which was sold in 1848 to Fábio Alexandrino de Carvalho Reis, Theophilus A. de Carvalho Leal and A. Rego, and would produce "O Progresso", the first daily newspaper of Maranhão, started in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Matos Belarmino has been considered by many historians as one of the best printers that Brazil has ever had.&lt;ref&gt;MATTOS, José Veríssimo, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; He created a union, the "Associação Typographica Maranhense", inaugurated on 11 May 1857, one of the first organizations of Brazil's workers outside of Rio de Janeiro (it was preceded, in Rio de Janeiro, by the "Imperial Associação Typographica Fluminense", founded on December 25, 1853).
* '''Pernambuco'''
In [[Pernambuco]], [[Recife]] had the first typography, the "Oficina Tipográfica da República restaurada de Pernambuco" in 1817, which was soon closed by the government for political reasons. In 1820, governor [[Luís do Rego Barreto]] ordered the building of a "screw press," the traditional model, in the local arsenal, or on the train, then becoming known as "Officina do Trem de Pernambuco", and the design of French teacher Jean-Paul Adour, was appointed to run it. When Rego was dismissed, it came to be called "Officina do Trem Nacional" in 1821 and then "Typographia Nacional". Also in Recife was the competitor Manuel Clemente do Rego Cavalcante, who settled with newly brought equipment from Portugal, associating with Felipe Mena Calado da Fonseca and the Englishman James Prinches; former priest and Portuguese professor Antônio José de Miranda Falcão learned the art of typography. In addition to these, two other printers were "Typographia Fidedigna" run by Manuel Zeferino dos Santos, from 1827-1840, and Typographia do Cruzeiro, which began in 1829.

In Olinda, Manuel Figueroa de Faria opened in mid-1831, the "Pinheiro Faria e Companhia", which moved then to Recife, and that may have been responsible for the first books of Pernambuco; it published the "Diario de Pernambuco", having bought their rights of Antonio José de Miranda Falcão, in 1835. At the time, there were 14 printers and 4 lithographic establishments in Recife. One of the most important was the "União" of Santos e Cia., founded in 1836 by the priest Ignacio Francisco dos Santos.

Perhaps the most interesting publication of Pernambuco, at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; was the work of [[Nísia Floresta]] (the pseudonym of [[Dionysia Gonçalves Pinto]]), "Direitos das Mulheres e Injustiças do Homens". This was a free adaptation of the work [[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]], authored by feminist Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin in 1792.

Other printers of note are the Canon Marcelino Pacheco Amaral, who installed a printing press in his own house, only to publish his "[[Compendio de theologia moral]] (Compendium of moral theology)" in three volumes produced between 1888-1890, and then sold his "Imprensa Econômica" to a local publisher, Tobias Barreto, in 1847. He founded in [[Escada, Pernambuco|Escada]], in the interior of Pernambuco, the "Typographia Constitucional", which lasted until 1888.
* '''Paraíba'''
In Paraiba, the "Typographia Nacional da Paraíba" stands out. It printed the first provincial newspaper.
* '''Pará'''
In Pará, the printer João Francisco Madureira manufactured his own press. Already in 1822, the Liberal Press published the first newspaper of Pará, and the fifth in Brazil, "O Paraense", by the master printer Daniel Garção de Melo. The "Typographia de Santos e Menor" of Honorio José dos Santos, gave the first important publication, "Ensaio corográfico sobre a província do Pará", by [[António Ladislau Monteiro Baena]]. Then the press changed the name to "Santos e Filhos (Santos and Sons)" and later, "Santos e Irmão (Santos and Brother)."
* '''In the other provinces'''
After Pará, the picture that emerged in terms of the arrival of the press in the provinces is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;ERICKSEN, Nestor, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ceará]] in 1824, [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] in February 1827, [[Rio Grande do Sul]] in June 1827, [[Goiás]] in 1830, [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] in 1831, [[Alagoas]] in 1831, [[Sergipe]] in 1832, [[Rio Grande do Norte]] in 1832, the [[Espírito Santo]] in 1840, [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] in 1853 (Rizzini argues that it was in 1849&lt;ref&gt;RIZZINI, Carlos, 1946 e 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;), Amazonas in 1854, Piaui in 1832, Mato Grosso in 1840&lt;ref&gt;Diferentemente, a "História da Tipogafia no Brasil", de C. M. Semeraro e C. Ayrosa, 1941, dá como Amazonas em 1851, Piauí em 1835 e Mato Grosso em 1839&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing in Rio de Janeiro ==
The new Portuguese constitution, adopted on 15–16 February 1821, abolished censorship, and soon Brazil saw a flood of publications emerging.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  Also ended was the monopoly of the government press. In 1821, the installation of "Nova Officina Typographica" by private owners was allowed, followed by "Typographia de Moreira e Garcez" in Rio de Janeiro. On the eve of the Independence of Brazil, the city already had about seven printing establishments. Manuel Joaquim da Silva Porto, poet and bookseller, who had introduced in Brazil the dramatic tragedy [[Phèdre]], by the French dramatist, one of the three great playwrights of 17th-century France, [[Jean Racine]], and was a printer the Royal Press, started his "Officina de Silva Porto e Cia.", along with Felizardo Joaquim da Silva Moraes, making this the first bookseller in the city to have its own printing press.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer Victoriano José dos Santos and Silva set up the "Officina dos Anais Fluminenses" (Officina of Fluminenses Proceedings; there was also the modern "Typographia Astréia", which printed a newspaper with the same name, and the firm "Torres e Costa: Innocêncio Francisco Torres e Vicente Justiniano da Costa", which was soon replaced by "Typographia Innocencio Francisco Torres e Companhia." By along with the number of printing presses, there was also an increase in the number of bookstores in Rio de Janeiro.

In 1823, Paulo Martim Filho, who had moved to the Rua dos Pescadores, No. 14, was best known bookseller in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]. Silva Porto, at [[Rua da Quitanda]], was second in importance, but in all there were 11 other bookstores, and one of them was that of Francisco Luiz Saturnino da Veiga. To remarry, Francisco donated the dowry of his deceased wife to the older children, João Pedro Ferreira da Veiga and Evaristo da Veiga, who entered on their own into the book market, buying the establishment of Silva Porto.

The predominance of Rio de Janeiro in the literary market began in the 1840s and continued until 1880, despite the attempt of other provincial cities, such as the [[Casa Garraux]], the famed bookstore of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], which had at the time 400 printed works in the province i.e. 11% of all the titles in the country.

Also noteworthy is the "Casa do Livro Azul" ("Blue Book House"), at Rua do Ouvidor, which ran from 1828 to 1852;&lt;ref&gt;MACEDO, Joaquim Manuel de, 1878&lt;/ref&gt; its owner, Albino Jourdan, lost his sight and hearing and was helped by two assistants, aged 14 and 17 years.
* '''Pierre Plancher'''
[[Pierre René Constant Plancher de la Noah]], became an official printer in France in 1798. After numerous political problems with the French government, went to Rio de Janeiro in 1824, and while waiting for the Customs to release their equipment, opened his provisional shop at 60, Rua dos Ourives, in March 1824. In June of that year, he moved to the Rua do Ouvidor, initially at No. 80, then No. 95, and soon began to publish in Portuguese. Much of his publications were administrative. Among his many publications, highlights included the "Annuario Histórico Brasiliense" in 1824, the year in an almanac, "Folhinhas de Algibeira e de Porta", and in 1827, the "Almanack Plancher."
[[File:Convite_e_noticia.jpg|right|thumb|200x200px|Jornal do Commercio, of June 10, 1900.]]
Plancher published the first Brazilian soap opera, "Statira a Zoroastes" by Lucas Jose Alvarenga, in 1826, comprising 58 pages. Previously, Paul Martin published some novels, but these were translated from French. Plancher published the journal "Spectador Brasileiro", a newspaper that lasted until May 23, 1827. He later acquired the "Diário Mercantil", from Francisco Manuel Ferreira and Company, and changed its name to [[Jornal do Commercio]], which became the oldest in the city of Rio from January. It is assigned to the new Plancher printing process known as lithography, which was invented in 1798 and only began to become widespread in 1815, replacing the recording on metal plates.

The printer working for Plancher was [[Hércules Florence|Hercule Florence]], who gave up the post to follow a journey of exploration and anthropology with [[Baron Langsdorff]]. The first printer in Brazil, therefore, became Armand Marie Julien Pallière, who worked a while for the Military Archives in 1819, and was replaced by Johann Jacob Steinmann, who arrived in Rio de Janeiro in 1825 and some years later returned to Switzerland, where he published his collection of printed views, "Souvenirs of Rio de Janeiro".

Thanks to the apprentices of Steinmann, in 1846 Rio de Janeiro had four lithography printers. The oldest was that of [[Luis Aleixo Boulanger]], founded on August 15, 1829, and the most important was the firm "Ludwig e Briggs," which existed between 1843 and 1877. The main competitor of Briggs was "Heaton e Rensburg" founded in 1840 (by Englishman George Mathia Heaton and the Dutchman Eduard Rensburg), whose main feature was the publication of music.
&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Metal_movable_text.jpg|thumb|Moveable type on a linotype.]]
After the abdication of D. Pedro I, in 1832, the book trade suffered the economic effects of political uncertainty, and Plancher sold his firm to two countrymen on 9 June 1832. The buyers were Junio Constancio de Villeneuve and Réol- Antoine Mougenot, and July 15, 1834, Mougenot sold his share to Villeneuve, who has owned the first mechanical press in the southern hemisphere,&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; after the first rotary and first Linotype. Its competitors were the "[[Typographia Nacional]]", "[[Paula Brito]]," "Laemmert", the "Typographia do Diário", and the printers [[Correio Mercantil]] and [[Correio da Tarde]]. At the time, two of the oldest registered Brazilian novels were produced: "O Aniversário de D. Miguel em 1828" by J. M. Pereira da Silva in 1838, and "Os Assassinos Misteriosos (The Mysterious Assassins)", by Justiniano José da Rocha, in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Boletim Bibliográfico Brasileiro, 6 (7):374, agosto, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Louis Mongie'''
Louis Mongie had a major bookstore at Ouvidor Street, from 1832 until 1853, the year of his death, at which time the bookstore was transferred to "Pinto &amp; Waldemar," which became, around 1860, "F. L. Pinto &amp; Cia., "And then to "J. Barboza e Irmão"- all of whom called themselves, however, "Imperial Library ".
* '''Paula Brito'''
In 1831, Francisco de Paula Brito, who came from a humble family and learned to read from his sister, bought a small property of their relative Sílvio José de Almeida Brito, in Praça da Constituição (Constitution Square), No. 51. It was a stationery and bindery, besides selling tea. Brito installed a small printing press there, which he had purchased from E. C. dos Santos, and in the year 1833, Brito already had two establishments: the "Typographia Fluminense," the Rua da Constituição, 51, and "Typographia Imparcial" on No. 44; in 1837, he moved to No. 66 and expanded the store to number 64 in 1939. In 1848, Brito already had six manual printers and mechanics, and expanded its facilities to No. 68 and 78, a "corner shop" which became his bookstore and stationery outlet. He created branches in partnership with [[Antonio Goncalves Teixeira e Sousa]] and Candido Lopes, forming with the latter the "Tipografia e Loja de Lopes e Cia", in Niterói. Cândido Lopes would become later the first printer of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

In his shop, Francisco de Paula Brito created the "Sociedade Petalógica" which had such a name because of the "freedom" Brito said that its members give to the imagination (a peta = a lie), and gathered together all the members of the Romantic movement of 1840-1860: [[Antonio Goncalves Dias]], [[Laurindo Rabelo]], [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]], [[Manuel Antônio de Almeida|Manuel Antonio de Almeida]], among others. All the elite of the time, among the politicians, artists and leaders, gathered at the "Paula Brito Bookstore."
[[File:Litography_press_with_map_of_Moosburg_02.jpg|left|thumb|A lithographic press.]]
In 1851, Brito entered the field of lithography; one of his magazines, "A Marmota na Corte (The Marmots in the Court)," included a costume. Brito brought the Paris lithographer Louis Thérier, who became the lithographer for the magazine. Created on December 2, 1850 the new "Imperial Typographia Dous de Dezembro," its name marking the anniversary date of Dom Pedro II, who became its shareholder. Paula Brito was the first non-specialized genuine editor of the country, which came up with a wide variety of works and subjects, unlike their predecessors, who were devoted to more technical matters.

Paula Brito edited the country's first women's magazine in 1832, "A Mulher do Simplício" or "A Fluminense Exaltada", which was printed by Plancher, his friend. The magazine lasted until 1846, when it was replaced by "A Marmota (The Woodchuck)", which lasted, with some title changes, from 1849 to 1864, three years after his death.

There are reports of 372 non-periodical publications made by Paula Brito, on quite varied themes, and of those, 83 were in the medical field, usually theses,&lt;ref&gt;GONDIN, Eunice Ribeiro, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; but most constituted dramas. Brito encouraged the growth of the national literature, still precarious. It can be considered the first Brazilian novel with some literary value has been "O Filho do Pescador (The Fisherman's Son)," by [[Antonio Goncalves Teixeira e Sousa]], published by Brito in 1843. He used the poet [[Casimiro de Abreu]] and the young [[Machado de Assis]], who began as a proofreader of Paula Brito and began the literary career as a collaborator of "A Marmota Fluminense".

In early 1857, dissatisfied shareholders oversaw the liquidation of "Typographia Dous de Dezembro." His firm was reduced to "Typographia de Paula Brito," with only one address, even that thanks to the financial support of the emperor. The publication of books fell, dropping to 12 in 1858 and 15 in 1861, the year of his death. His widow continued the business in partnership with their son in law until 1867, amidst falling production. In 1868 Mrs. Rufina Rodrigues da Costa Brito was alone, transferring the business to Rua do Sacramento, nº 10, which survived until 1875.
* '''Garnier'''
Among the various bookstores in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], at Rua do Ouvidor, while some were owned by Frenchmen, such as Plancher and Villeneuve, others were other branches of existing companies in France such as [[Mongie]], [[Aillaud]] and [[Bossange]]. Prominent among these the Brothers [[Firmin Didot]], but in order of importance, the most prominent was the [[Garnier Frères]], who worked in Brazil from 1844 to 1934.

The brothers Auguste (born in 1812) and Hippolyte (born in 1816) [[Garnier]] began working as bookstore clerks in [[Paris]] in 1828, and later opened their own business, at the age of 21 and 17 years. The younger brother, [[Baptiste Louis Garnier]] (born March 4, 1823), worked for his brother until 1844, and then went to Brazil, arriving in Rio de Janeiro on June 24, 1844. After two years of temporary accommodation, he settled at Rua do Ouvidor, nº 69, and remained there until 1878, moving to No. 71 in front of its main competitor, the "Livraria Universal" E. &amp; H. Laemmert. By 1852, the firm was called the "Garnier Brothers" then "B. L. Garnier "and it is believed that the brothers separated between 1864 and 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1870s, Garnier had its own printing press, the "Tipografia Franco-americana." Overall, Garnier is credited with 655 works by Brazilian authors published between 1860 and 1890 and several translations, from the French, of the most popular novels. Garnier influenced the French format of books that Brazil adopted: octavo (16.5 x 10.5&amp;nbsp;cm) and 'in-doze' (17.5 x 11.0&amp;nbsp;cm, a size close to the A format paperback), an imitation of the Parisian firm [[Calmann-Levy]].
&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, in poor health, Baptiste started negotiations for the sale of his company, but dissatisfied with the price, gave up and died three years later, on 1 October 1893; the company passed on to his brother Hippolyte, who resided in Paris, thus returning to being the branch of the "Garnier Frères" in Rio de Janeiro.

Hippolyte Garnier was 77 years old when his brother Baptiste died. The Garnier in France ended up being in the 1890s and 1920s the leading publisher of Spanish-American literature worldwide. The death of Baptiste, as well as of the Laemmert brothers, caused a stagnation in the Brazilian book market, and the fall of the empire completely transformed the social climate. In 1898, Hyppolite sent to [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] a new manager, Julien Lansac, and his Jacinto Silva became his assistant, who had great autonomy, given the difficulties of Julien to speak Portuguese. Hippolyte was sent reform the Garnier facilities, which opened with fanfare. Each guest was presented with an autographed copy of the 2nd edition of Don Casmurro, by Machado de Assis. Around 1904, Jacinto Silva left the firm and was directing the Casa Garraux books department, in São Paulo, and in 1920 launched his own "Casa Editora O Livro," which was the center of the modernist movement.

Garnier Hippolyte died at age 95 in 1911, and Lansac returned to France in 1913; the business passed to a nephew, Auguste P. Garnier, who sent to Rio de Janeiro another French manager, Émile Izard (born in 1874). From then, Garnier went into decline, with few publications, and the end came close to 1934, when the Garnier Bookstore was sold to [[Ferdinand Briguiet]] who previously bought the Lachaud bookstore, on Rua Nova do Ouvidor.
* '''Briguiet-Garnier'''
When Garnier was sold, it began to use the name Bookstore Briguiet-Garnier, and lasted until 1951, when the "[[Difusão Européia do Livro]]" (Difel) took the Brazilian subsidiary of Garnier. The Garnier building was demolished in 1953 to give place to a bank, and Briguiet was restricted to Rua Nova do Ouvidor. Briguiet then had been replaced by his nephew Ferdinand, who died without heirs in the mid 1970. Some of the firm's assets were purchased by "Library Itatiaia" of Belo Horizonte and the Briguiet shop was closed in 1973.
* '''Lombaerts'''
Among the foreign bookstores in Rio de Janeiro, one that stood out was the [[Belgian]] [[Jean Baptiste Lombaerts]]'s (1821-1875) that of and his son Henri Gustave Lombaerts (1845-1897), which was the largest of lithographs mounted at the time at Rua do Ourives, No 17. It ran between 1848 and 1904 when the store was demolished to make way for Avenida Central. From 1871 to 1879, the library has produced a supplement in Portuguese to follow one of its main imported periodicals, the French magazine "La Saison". From 1879, it began to publish its own Brazilian edition of the magazine, named "A Estação".
[[File:Woodcut,_early_demo.jpg|right|thumb|200x200px|Woodcuts of the sixteenth century illustrating the production of the woodcut. At first, the artist sketches the picture. Second, he uses a chisel to dig the wood block to receive the ink.]]
Another prominent firm was the Swiss Leuzinger, founded by [[Georg Leuzinger]] (1813-1892), who arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] in 1832, and until 1840 had saved enough to buy the oldest stationery outlet of the city, "the Red Book" of Jean Charles Bouvier, at Rua do Ouvidor, 31. In 1852, Leuzinger acquired Typographia Franceza, founded by [[Jean Soleil Saint Amand]] in 1837, and in 1841 published the first poems of [[Joaquim Norberto]], "Modulações Poéticas", and the first two editions, in 1844 and 1845, of "[[A Moreninha]]", by [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]]. Under the direction of Leuzinger, this became one of the best equipped printing houses in the country. Leuzinger had much involvement in the development of wood engraving (woodcut) in the country, and in 1843, brought from Germany two talented engravers wood, [[Eduard Hüslemann]] and R. Rollenberger. In 1850, Rollenberger died of yellow fever and Hüslemann returned to Germany, but left behind many apprentices in Brazil. Leuzinger was responsible, among other things, for the introduction of illustrated postcards in the country, and ventured into photography too. The 54 woodcuts that illustrate the book of Louis and Elizabeth Agassiz, "Journey in Brazil", 1868, are by Leuzinger. As a press, the Leuzinger survived under the name "Gráfica Ouvidor".
* '''Laemmert'''
The most important foreign bookshops was, however, [[Laemmert]]; between 1893 and the turn of the century, it was the main Brazilian publisher. [[Eduard Laemmert]] (born August 10, 1806) and Heinrich (born October 27, 1812) were children of F. W. Laemmert, a Protestant clergyman who educated them at home and at 14 sent them to learn the book trade. Leaving for Paris, Eduard was working in the firm of Bossange Martin and his son Hector. Two years later, Bossange decided to open a branch in Rio de Janeiro, and Eduard, as representative of Bossange, opened a company with a Portuguese called Souza, representative of JP Aillaud. They set up shop at [[Rua dos Latoeiros]] (now Gonçalves Dias), No. 88 under the Souza Laemmert name. When the contract expired in 1833, Eduard decided to stay in Brazil, married a Brazilian and started his own business in Quitanda Street # 77, the "Livraria Universal". His brother Heinrich came, at his request, to Brazil, and formed the "E. &amp; H. Laemmert, mercadores de livros e de música (E. &amp; H. Laemmert, dealers of books and music)" in 1838. Soon began to edit and in 1839 created their "Folhinha "annual. In 1844, they began the "[[Almanack Laemmert]]" which surpassed all competitors and, in 1875, came to have 1770 pages. They set up in 1868 at Rua do Ouvidor, 68. The printing press Laemmert was inaugurated on January 2, 1838, and named [[Typographia Universal]].

In 1877, Eduard moved away from the firm, going to [[Karlsruhe]], the city where he had learned the craft, and suddenly died there on January 18, 1880. Henry died four years later. All the business went over to a company formed by Gustave Massow, Henry's son-Edgon Widmann Laemmert and Arhur Sauer. In 1891 the firm was reorganized under the name of Laemmert &amp; Companhia, and in 1898, had branches in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and [[Recife]]. In 1903, there was another change of partners, and Edgon was replaced by his son Hugo and Gustave by his brother Hilario. Laemmert had a library with a copy of each edition produced, but this was destroyed by fire in 1909, after which the library was never reopened. The copyright of their property were sold to Francisco Alves, who acquired the most famous of their titles, "Os Sertões", by Euclides da Cunha, whom Laemmert published in 1902 and sold three editions.

Printing continued, and the property, which had been with Arthur Sauer, went to Manuel José da Silva in 1910, who already owned the "Anuário Geral de Portugal (General Yearbook of Portugal)", then the almanac changed the name to "Anuário do Brasil (Brazil Yearbook)". The new organization has undergone several ownership changes, becoming "Sergio &amp; Pinto" in 1919, "Alvaro Pinto &amp; Cia." in 1920, Alexandre Henault &amp; Cia. in 1921, and in 1925 was acquired by the [[Jockey Club of Rio de Janeiro]], where it was called "Almanack Laemmerte Limited". Few books have been produced at that time, especially the "Livro de Ouro do Centenário a Independência do Brasil (Golden Centenary Book of the Independence of Brazil)", on September 7, 1922. In 1942, another fire destroyed the Almanac, and the last number was from 1943. The Gráfica Laemmert returned to publish books by 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sellos &amp; Couto'''
The Sellos &amp; Couto firm was founded in 1815, when José Gonçalves Agra opened a bookstore in Rua do Sabão, No. 22. In the 1820s, the company passed into the hands of Agostinho Gonçalves de Freitas, who was succeeded in 1852 by his nephews Antonio and Agostinho Gonçalves Guimaraes, who added to it a printing workshop, "Typographia Episcopal". Antonio began to devote himself to banking and Augustine retired in 1887, selling the firm to his stepson John Antonio Pinto. When he died, bankrupt, the business was purchased by Antonio Joaquim de Sellos and Gaspar Pereira Couto, who began operating first as Sellos, Guimarães &amp; Cia., Then as Sellos &amp; Couto.
* '''J. Ribeiro dos Santos'''
J. Ribeiro dos Santos, another major firm, was founded by the Portuguese Serafim José Alves, in 1871, at 11, Praça D. Pedro II, today Praça 15 de Novembro. At the end of the century, it moved to the Rua Sete de setembro, No. 83, and soon afterwards adopted the name of the heir of Alves, Jacintho Ribeiro dos Santos. Jacintho bought the Francisco Rodrigues da Cruz bookstore, successor to the Livraria Cruz Coutinho, the Livraria Popular, which was created by Antonio Augusto da Cruz Coutinho. The Library Jacintho Ribeiro dos Santos stood out for the good workmanship of its textbooks, use of images, and the high number of runs in any of its books, which reached the mark of over 100,000 copies in 1924, in a population of 1,157,141 in the city. As "Livraria Jacintho", it survived until 1945 when it was bought over by "Editora A Noite".
* '''Livraria Quaresma'''
The Livraria de Serafim José Alves seems to have had some connection also with the [[Livraria Quaresma]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pedro da Silva Quaresma was the founder of the "Livraria do Povo" in 1879 inRua São José. The Livraria Quaresma lasted until the 1960s, with cheap books and those of a popular appeal, and was the training grounds for bookseller and used bookstore owner Carlos Ribeiro, who later founded the "Livraria São José", active in the 1950s and 1960s.
* '''Antônio Joaquim Castilho'''
The bookseller and printer Castilho is also from this time, but the most important individual from this firm was his son, Antonio Joaquim Castilho. Castilho faced financial difficulties and in 1931, his firm became the "Livraria América", of A, Bedeschi, which lasted until the 1940s, and Castilho was working at [[Editora Civilização Brasileira]].
* '''Francisco Alves'''
Born on August 2 de1848, Francisco Alves d'Oliveira went to Rio in 1863, and got a job in a store of nautical items, and savings. He opened a used bookstore in Rua São José, then he sold it and went back to [[Porto]]. Upon receiving his uncle's invitation to work at his bookstore, he went to Brazil again, and was naturalized on 28 July 1883. The firm Francisco Alves, originally called Livraria Clássica, was founded on August 15, 1854, at Rua of Braziers, No. 54 (later changed to No. 48), by his uncle Nicholas Antonio Alves. Francisco ended up buying the shares of all partners and his uncle by 1897. Initially devoted to textbooks, due to the increasing of the number of schools in the country (in the last years of the Empire, schools increased from 3,561 to 7,500), Francisco Alves came to have a near monopoly of textbooks in Brazil.

Livraria Francisco Alves opened its first branch in São Paulo, on April 23, 1893, where Manuel Pacheco Leão, some of the education secretary and friend of Francis, Teófilo das Neves Leão, was charged with part of the shares of the company. In 1906, he opened a second branch in [[Belo Horizonte]]. In São Paulo, acquired the "N. Falconi "and "Livraria Melilo"; in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], he acquired "Lombaerts," the "Livraria Católica de Sauvin", the "Livraria Luso-Brasileira" of Lopes da Cunha, the "Empresa Literária Fluminense", of AA da Silva Lobo, the home of "Domingos de Magalhães ". He also bought the Portuguese firm "A Editora", formerly "David Corazzi". In 1909, he acquired the "Laemmert", acquiring the rights to "[[Os Sertões]]", by [[Euclides da Cunha]], and [[Inocência|Innocence, Taunay]]. He also bought a small bookstore "Viúva Azevedo" in Rio de Janeiro.

In the literary line, Francisco Alves published [[Júlio Afrânio Peixoto|Afrânio Peixoto]], [[Emílio de Menezes]], [[Raul Pompeia|Raul Pompeii]], among others, but most of his books were printed abroad, for economic and technical reasons which prevented the internal printing, which was the cause of criticism from many nationalists. In his spare time, [[Francisco Alves]] wrote his own books under the pseudonym William Prado or F. d'Oliveira. They were cataloged after his death, totalling some 39 books of his own.
&lt;ref&gt;BRAGA, Oswaldo de Melo.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alves was diabetic and acquired pneumonia that led to tuberculosis. When the member Leo Pacheco died on December 23, 1913, Alves acquired the share of the widow, but himself died on June 29, 1917, after complications from a broken leg in a railway accident. In his will, he left a great legacy and a lifetime pension to a lady who had been his mistress since 1891, Maria Dolores Braun. All the rest of his property would be left for the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]], but with the condition that the Academy should hold every five years, two competitions in his honor, each with a first prize of 10 short stories, a second five stories and a third of three stories. One of the contests should be for monographs on "the best way to expand primary education in Brazil," and the other for monographs on the Portuguese language.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Academy is statutorily prevented from managing any type of business, it sold the bookshop to a group of former employees, led by Paulo Ernesto Azevedo Pacheco, Leão's successor in managing the affiliate of São Paulo, and Antonio de Oliveira Martins. The new company adopted the name "Paulo de Azevedo &amp; Companhia", but continued to use the mark F. Alves, and to dominate the market of textbooks until the appearance of [[Companhia Editora Nacional]], of Octalles Marcondes Ferreira, in the decade of the 1920s.

Paulo Azevedo died in 1946 and was succeeded by his children Ivo and Ademar. The latter admitted as members Alvaro Ferreira de Almeida, Raul da Silva Passos and Lelio de Castro Andrade, to work towards the revitalization of the bookshop. In 1972, the company was sold to Admiral José Celso de la Rocque Maciel Soares Guimarães, who changed its name to "Livraria Francisco Alves Editora"; in 1974, Netumar shipping company, owned by Ariosto Amado, acquired 80% of its capital and Carlos Leal took over its management.
* '''Other publishers'''
Other major publishers and bookstores at the end of the nineteenth century were the publishing firm [[Editora Pimenta de Mello]], founded in 1845 and which survived until 1937, and the [[Livraria Moderna]], Domingos de Magalhaes e Companhia, a leading publisher in the field of literature in the 1890s.

== Publishing in São Paulo ==
* '''Século XIX'''
[[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], in the early nineteenth century, formed a single province together with [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], had a small capital with less than 10,000 inhabitants, and then enjoyed little importance.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, [[José da Costa Carvalho]], the future [[Marquis of Monte Alegre]], imported a press and a printer, and produced the first newspaper of the province, "[[O Farol Paulistano]]".

In 1827, the city of São Paulo was chosen to host one of the two country's law schools, and student life there transformed the city. In 1836, a São Paulo press printed the book, "Questões sobre presas marítimas," by Jose Maria Avelar Brotero. This was followed by other works, and the first of the locally produced literature emerged: in 1849, Rosas e Goivos, by the then student [[José Bonifácio the Younger|José Bonifácio, o Moço]] and, in 1852, Cantos da Solidão, by [[Bernardo Guimaraes]], printed in "Typographia Liberal" which was owned by Joaquim Roberto de Azevedo Marques.

In 1855, [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] had a population of only 25,000 inhabitants, while [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] had crossed a quarter million and [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and [[Recife]] were over 80,000. There were three bookstores, "Fernandes de Souza," "Gravesnes" and "Torres de Oliveira," and three presses, the "Typographia Liberal" of Azevedo Marques, the "Typographia Dous de Dezembro" (no connection with the Paula Brito) of Antonio Antunes Lousada, and "Typographia Litteraria". There also was a bookbinder, the German U. Knossel, whose business was acquired in 1880 by the German Jorge Seckler, and became important graphic with steam-powered printers. In the late 1860, also in operation were the "Typographia Litteraria", the "Typographia Americana" and "Typographia Americana" typography.
* '''Casa Garraux'''
In 1860, the French publisher [[Baptiste Louis Garnier]] opened a branch in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and entrusted it to Anatole Louis Garraux (1833-1904). Three years later, Garraux became independent and opened the Livraria Acadêmica, in partnership with Guelfe de Lailhac and Raphael Suares. This publishing house was known as "Casa Garraux". It was in the Casa Garraux that [[José Olympio]] began to build an interest in the book market, getting a job tidying and cleaning books there.

Before 1920, Garraux did not publish, but became a prominent bookseller, becoming the bookstore with the most updated stock of the country.&lt;ref&gt;ANDREWS, Christofer C. Brazil, its condition and prospects.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1872, [[coffee]] was modifying the provincial scene, and in this year the Garraux moved from Largo da Sé to the Rua da Imperatriz (the future XV de Novembro), going on to play role important in the intellectual and cultural development of the region. Garraux passed on the direction of the store at that time to his son in law Willy Fischer, who retired in 1888, and his successor, Alexander Thiollier,   ran the business until 1893, then moving the direction of the hands of the partner Charles Hildebrand, of Strasbourg.

* '' 'Other São Paulo bookstores' ''
From three bookstores in 1850, São Paulo grew to five in 1870, one of these being the "Great Library Paulista", which the brothers Antonio and Maria José Joaquim Teixeira opened in 1876.

In 1893, due to Italian immigration and also the trail of drought in the North East, São Paulo grew in size to have 192,409 inhabitants&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; and at the turn of the century, it equaled Rio de Janeiro, with 239,820 inhabitants. The paper industry installed in the state began to grow; one of the factories was the "Cia. Melhoramentos de São Paulo", formed in 1890 by Colonel Anthony Proost Brill, and in 1920 joined the paper industry for books, associating with the label of "Weiszflog Brothers". At the end of the century, however, São Paulo still had only eight bookstores. Among others, the prominent ones included "Casa Eclectica".

== 20th century ==
* '''Monteiro Lobato'''

Till the [[World War I|First World War]], Brazilian books were printed mostly in Europe. The Garnier Publisher, used by [[Machado]] and almost all [[Brazilian Academy of Letters|Academic]], was French and had their workshops in [[France]]. [[Coelho Neto]] was printed on [[Porto]] in [[Portugal]], and edited by Lelo &amp; Brother. Brazilian publishers and bookstores devoted themselves more to textbooks, and little was printed in Brazil.

[[Monteiro Lobato|Lobato]] took the initiative that changed the Brazilian publishing market. Printed on their own, in the newspaper presses of "[[O Estado de S. Paulo]]", his book [[Urupês]], found that at the time, Brazil had only 30 bookstores that were able to receive and sell books.&lt;ref&gt;NEVES, Arthur.&lt;/ref&gt; He then wrote to all postmasters of Brazil (1300 in all), requesting the names and addresses of newsagents, stationers, warehouses and pharmacies interested in selling books.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 2005, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 100% of postal agents responded, providing a network of nearly two thousand distributors across the country. Lobato began publishing works of his friends and novice writers.
[[File:Monteiro_Lobato.jpg|right|thumb | 217x217px|Lobato, one of the great supporters of the book in Brazil, Companhia Editora Nacional: "A country is made with men and books."]]
When the original firm of Cia. Gráfio-Editora Monteiro Lobato collapsed, Octalles Marcondes Ferreira (1899-1972), who was his assistant and became his partner, encouraged him to open another publishing venture, and in November 1925, the Companhia Editora Nacional was already established and was preparing to publish a version, supervised by Lobato, of the 1st book written in Brazil in the sixteenth century, the story of [[Hans Staden]], "My Captivity Among the Brazilian Wild," with a print run of 5000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 2005, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

While Octalles remained in São Paulo, Lobato ran the branch of Rio de Janeiro; traveling to the United States, due to speculation in the stock market and the crash of October 1929, Lobato had to sell to Octalles his publisher's shares, and went on to contribute just as an author and translator.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 2005: . 347&lt;/ref&gt;

The publisher began investing gradually in educational titles. In 1932, Octalles acquired Editora Civilização Brasileira, founded in 1929 by Getúlio M. Costa, Ribeiro Couto e [[Gustavo Barroso]], and now, slowly, passed on to the son Enio Silveira. In 1934, the brand "Nacional" was almost entirely reserved for teaching and children's books. In 1943, there six teachers responsible for implementing the textbooks abandoning the company, they went on to found their own publishing house, the "Editora do Brasil", specializing in books relating to [[Didactic method|teaching]]. The assistant of Octalles, Arthur Neves (1916-1971), left and formed Editora Brasiliense, which launched its own bookstore, the "Livraria Brasiliense."

Octalles died in 1973, and presidency of the company passed on to his brother Lindolfo. In 1974 Livraria José Olympio Editora requested financial aid to buy the publisher,&lt;ref&gt;Millarch, Aramis.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this operation was never undertaken. "The company Jose Olimpio requested government aid: in this case, the total financing of the operation, so the National Bank for Economic Development ([[Brazilian Development Bank|BNDES]]) acquired all the shares of the company [...] however, the economic situation of José Olympio made the desired transfer impossible and the Nacional eventually became property of the BNDE."&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, Laurence, 2005, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the Brazilian Institute of Pedagogical Issues (IBEP) acquired Companhia Editora Nacional, forming one of the largest publishing groups in the country. In 2009, [[Conrad Editora]], specializing in [[Comics|Comic]], was bought by IBEP-Group Company Editora Nacional&lt;ref&gt;ASSISI, Erico.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '' 'Jose Olympio' ''
The publisher started in 1931, also in São Paulo, with a successful book, "Know thyself by psychoanalysis," by the American J. Ralph, a work that today is known as a self-help title.&lt;ref name = "Silvers. House "&gt;[http://veja.abril.com.br/061206/p_136.htm Pratas House]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s, Olympio became the country's largest publisher, publishing 2 000 titles, with 5000 issues, which in the 1980s comprised 30 million books 900 national authors and 500 foreign authors books.

The Livraria José Olympio bookstore got into a crisis that began with the collapse in the stock market. In the 1970s, he tried to buy Companhia Editora Nacional. On May 3, 1990, when he died, José Olympio was no longer owner of the publishing house that bore his name, because after being taken over by the BNDES in the 70s, it was bought by Record in 2001; today it belongs to Grupo Editorial Record.&lt;ref name="Silvers. House "/&gt;
* '' 'Publisher Martins' ''
José de Barros Martins decided to leave the job to open a bookstore in a small room on the first floor of a building in the Rua da Quitanda in São Paulo, in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, Laurence, 2005, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt; He organized his own editorial department, under the direction of Edgard Cavalheiro and his first title in early 1940 was "Direito Social Brasileiro", dealing with the Brazilian social law, and authored by [[Antonio Ferreira Cesarino Junior]].

Martins promoted the liquidation of his company in 1974, but tried to remain in the business, the most valuable negotiating publishing contracts with Editora Record.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 2005, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Martins Editora is an imprint of Livraria Martins Fontes.

* '' 'Civilização Brasileira' ''
Founded by Getúlio M. Costa, Ribeiro Couto and [[Gustavo Barroso]] in 1929, the company Civilização Brasileira had at the time few titles, and in 1932 was acquired by Octalles Marcondes Ferreira,&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, Laurence, 2005, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; becoming part of the Companhia Editora Nacional. Enio Silveira took part in the Civilização Brasileira, and increased its impact, and at the end of the 1950s, it had become already one of the leading publishers in the country. In 1963, Enio Silveira took full control of Civilização Brasileira&lt;ref name = "Hallewell, p. 447"&gt;Hallewell, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year his book output was the same as that of the Companhia Editora Nacional, added 46 new titles. Civilização Brasileira eventually becoming the most important channel for modern Brazilian literature in the 1960s,&lt;ref name = "Hallewell, p. 447"&gt;Hallewell, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to devote to translations of both the European countries as the US, Japanese and Latin American.

In 1982, Enio accepted an operational supply from DIFEL, a foreign company, to cooperate with his firm. At the same time, Banco Pinto de Magalhães, the Portuguese bank, and a Portuguese entity, Batista da Silva, acquired 90% stake in Civilização Brasileira, and Enio's share was 10%. In March 1984, it formalized the transfer of the Civilização Brasileira operations to São Paulo, maintaining a branch in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, p. 509&lt;/ref&gt; Silveira of Enio died in 1996. Currently, the Civilização Brasileira is part of Grupo Editorial Record.
* '' 'Publisher Attica' ''
Between 1964 and 1965, Editora Attica made an impact. On 15 October 1956, the Curso de Madureza Santa Inês was founded, for the education of youth and adults, by the brothers Anderson Fernandes Dias and Vasco Fernandes Dias Filho and his friend Antonio Narvaes Filho. Over time, through the increasing number of students, the mimeograph became insufficient to print handouts, and 1962 saw the creation of Sesil (Sociedade Editora do Santa Inês Ltda. or the Santa Inês Publishing Society Ltd.). Anderson Fernandes Dias, however, backed the creation of a publishing house. Thus, Editora Attica emerged in August 1965, and the following year, it already had 20 titles in its catalog.

In 1999, Attica was bought by [[Editora Abril]], in partnership with the French group Vivendi. In 2002, Vivendi sold its publications branch companies to the French group Lagardère, but Editora Attica got out of that commercial transaction. In 2003, the two controlling shareholders of Attica - April and Vivendi - again put the publisher up for sale. After a year of negotiations, the financial assets of Vivendi were acquired by Editora Abril, in February 2004, becoming the majority owner of Editora Attica, ushering in a new phase in the company's history, which became part of Abril Education. In early 2005, the publisher began to work on building the Edifício Abril on Marginal Tiete.
* '' 'Bookstore Globe' ''
In the 1880s, the "Livraria Americana", originally set up in Pelotas, by Carlos Pinto, had several translations of foreign authors, not always with permission of the authors. Such cases, and many others, led to a reaction by the authors and the government, and began to establish laws in order to preserve those rights. The origins of Editora Globo belong to this time, but the publisher did not start a regular program of editions in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the early 1930s, the Livraria do Globo emerged in Porto Alegre, and the beginning of the publishing industry seems to have given especially the disadvantageous position of the new government with respect to the copyright rights of others States. The magazine Globo, having no money to republished materials, also resorted to piracy&lt;ref&gt;Verissimo, Erico.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flourishing of publishing activity was also due to the development and growth of the [[Rio Grande do Sul]],   at the time of the [[First Brazilian Republic|Old Republic]], 1889-1930. The [[Editora Globo]] started with a small stationery and bookstore, founded in 1883 by Portuguese immigrant Laudelino Pinheiro Barcellos, next to which was built a graphic workshop for custom work. José Bertaso, a boy admitted for minor services in 1890, became a partner and in 1919, the owner. Bertaso predicted shortages of paper with the [[World War I|First World War]] and cared enough to profit later from the sales. The "Barcellos, Bertaso and Co." acquired a linotype machine, the first in the state, and in 1922 began to publish books leading to a local literary revival, the counterpart of the [[Modernism|modernist movement]]. Mansueto Bernardi, an Italian and director of the publicity department, was even more ambitious, and encouraged the publication of translated titles. He has assembled a team of reviewers, translators and graphic artists, and created the magazine Revista do Globo.

Bernardi in 1931 with the creation of the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]], exited the field of editorial activity and began to drive the [[Mint (facility)|Mint]]. The eldest of his three sons, Henry d'Avila Bertaso, who began in Livraria Globo bookstore in 1922, at age 15, took over the publishing industry, while the direction of the Globe Magazine was given to a young writer, [[Erico Verissimo]], who becoma one of the main [[Translation|translators]] of the publisher. Verissimo's career as an author had begun in 1928 when Bernardi accepted his story "Ladrão de Gado" ("Cattle Thief") for theRevista do Globo magazine. His first book,  "Fantoches" ("Puppets") was a collection of short stories that H. Bertaso accepted for publication in 1932. After a few books, the only commercial success came in 1935 with "Caminhos Cruzados", which received several awards.
[[File:Revista_do_globo_anno_IV_n_7.jpg|thumb|196x196px | Cover 'magazine Globe' 'Year IV No. 7, 1932, with illustration of Francis Pelichek]].
Due to the economic situation, the Brazilian book became competitive, a fact that was capitalised on by the Livraria Globo bookstore. In 1936, the company already had three floors, 500 employees, 20 Linotype machines, and the publishing industry had about 500 titles. Verissimo passed on the control of the magazine to De Souza Júnior, and b H. Bertaso became editorial consultant, allowing for the gain of the literary publisher's quality. The policy emphasized the Anglo-American authors, due to the preponderance of translations from English. With the [[World War II]], there was a sudden prosperity in the book business, and several translators were employed, such as Leonel Vallandro, Juvenal Jacinto, Herbert Caro, and Homero de Castro as permanent employees. In the early 1950s, with the rigor in Brazil over the control of remittance of foreign currency abroad, there was a decline in the production of translations of the globe. There then was a slight recovery in the 1960s, but without recovery of the old interest especially in other areas.

Verissimo began to devote more to his own literary production; José Bertaso died in 1948 and in 1956, when the Globo reached its 2,000th title since 1930, it was decided to transform the publishing part of the business into a legally separate development, creating [[Editora Globo]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; Verissimo was gradually disengaging the Globo, and died in 1975. Henry Bertaso died in 1977, having passed on his business to his sons Jose Otavio, Fernando and Claudio. In 1986 the company was sold to Rio Gráfica Editora (GER) of [[Roberto Marinho]]. Rio Graphic started using only the Editora Globo name since.
* '' 'National Institute of Books' ''
With the revolution of 1930, the Rio Grande do Sul gained importance on the national scene. With the implementation of the Estado Novo, one of the consequences was the creation of the National Book Institute, the initiative of Minister Capanema in September / December 1937 (Decree-Law No. 93 of September 21 of 1937). The poet [[Augusto Meyer]] was the director until 1954 and again from 1961 to 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; It was created and encouraged by [[Getúlio Vargas]] with the objective of developing an [[encyclopedia]] and [[dictionary]] of the Brazilian language and to build the [[national identity|identity]] and [[national memory]] and support the implementation of public libraries throughout Brazil. Until 1945, however, they had not yet completed the encyclopedia and dictionary, but the number of public libraries has grown, especially in the states of cultural scarcity, thanks to the help provided by INL in the collection of the composition and technical training.
* '''Other prominent publishers'''
Besides those already mentioned, in the early twentieth century among the other important ones were, in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] Livraria H. Antunes founded by Hector Antunes in 1909, and Arthur Vecchi in 1913, which began with publication of books and later dedicated itself to [[comic books]]. Besides these, the [[Livraria Editora Leite Ribeiro e Maurillo]], founded in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] in 1917, and in the mid-1920s was renamed as Freitas Bastos; [[Livraria Schmidt Editora|Livraria Católica]], founded by the poet [[Augusto Frederico Schmidt]], in 1930, which soon became a meeting point for intellectuals of the time. Those who attended became known as the "Catholic Circle". Schmidt took later removed the 'Catholic' word from its name and it became and was just Livraria Schmidt Editora, which remained so until 1939, when the business was absorbed and the facilities acquired by Zélio Valverde, in whose firm Schmidt became a partner. Others are the [[Gianlorenzo Schettino Livraria Editora]], which existed from 1922 to 1931;Editora A. Coelho Branco, and [[Editora Ariel]], of the writers Gastao Cruls and Agripino Grieco, which was exclusively a publisher.

* '''Publishing in other states'''
In [[Rio Grande do Sul]], apart from [[Editora Globo]], the oldest publisher was the "Livraria e Editora Selbach", founded in 1931, having started its activity with "Farrapos!", by [[Walter Spalding]]. It ended around 1960, Other major publishers were "Livraria Sulina" founded in 1946 by the brothers Leopold and Nelson Boeck, which specialized in law, business administration and history. The "Tabajara" with textbooks, and [[L&amp;PM Editores]], created by Ivan Pinheiro Machado and Paulo de Lima, in 1974, at the time to publish a single book, "Rango, história em quadrinhos de um marginal" by Edgar Vasques, which had appeared before in the Porto Alegre newspaper "[[Folha da Manhã]]". Encouraged by the success, the two young editors began to publish a small number, but select titles, qustioning the government of the time, during the military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, other major publishers were [[Editora Movimento]] and Editora-Mercado-Aberto.

In [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], at [[Curitiba]], in the 1930s [[Editora Guaira]] gained national reputation with titles like "Esperança" by [[André Malraux]], "Doña Barbara" by [[Romulo Gallegos]], among others. In the early 1940s, production was 40 titles per year. It declined after World War II. Also in [[Curitiba]], Editora dos Professores, created by Ocyron Cunha in 1962, was intended to produce works of regional teachers, and is currently inactive.

[[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], despite having only a little publishing activity, has plenty of outlets, and most of its municipalities have bookstores, which got it the fifth national place in book sales in the 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 522&lt;/ref&gt;

In the other cities of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Petropolis]] was noteworthy, with [[Editora Vozes]] created on March 5, 1901, by the local [[Franciscan]] convent. It is the oldest publisher in Brazil still active.

In [[Minas Gerais]], at [[Belo Horizonte]] one initiative that stands out is the [[Livraria Itatiaia Editora]], as well as Editora Comunicação, Editora Vega, Interlivros and LEMI (Livraria Editora Miguilim), publisher of children's books.

In Bahia, between the 1940s and 1960s, the most important editorial brand was the "Livraria Progresso," by Aguiar and Souza Ltda. (not to be confused with the Progresso do Grupo Delta). Another was the Edições Macunaíma, founded in 1957 by [[Calasans Neto]], Fernando da Rocha Peres, Glauber Rocha and Paulo Soares Gili as Macunaíma Editorials Empreendimentos Ltda.

== Pocket books ==
[[File:Paperback-stack.png|right|200x200px|thumbs]]
There have been several attempts in Brazil to produce a lower-priced book.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; In the  "Coleção Globo" of [[Livraria do Globo]], in the early 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://somlivros.weebly.com/blog/um-legado-impresso-pela-historia Um legado impresso pela história] [https://somlivros.weebly.com/ Som Livros usados]&lt;/ref&gt;  24 titles were released, including classics, adventures and police fiction, in the format 11x16 cm, cartoned.

== Current editorial overview ==
From the 1980s there was an upward growth trend in the Brazilian publishing market, with an increase in the publishing sector. New publishers emerged, but many of the old have been replaced or incorporated into others. The [[Companhia Editora Nacional]], for example, currently belongs to [http://www.bienaldolivrosp.com.br/pt-BR/Exhibitors/419595/Grupo-IBEP Grupo-IBEP], and [[Civilização Brasileira]], the [[Grupo Editorial Record]], which appeared in 1942 and marked its entry into publishing in 1957. The [[Editora Pensamento-Cultrix]] merged into [[Editora Pensamento-Cultrix]] while [[Editora Cortez &amp; Moraes]] separated, forming the [[Editora Cortez]] and [[Editora Moraes]], which in turn became the [[Centauro Editora]] label. Old publishers survived as [[Editora Brasiliense]] and [[Editora Vozes]], the oldest still active in Brazil, and new publishers have grown and diversified the national publishing scene as [[Editora Perspectiva]] (1965), [[Editora Nórdica]] (1970), Editora Cátedra (1970), [[Martin Clare]] (1970), Alfa-Ômega (1973), [[Editora Rocco]] (1975), [[Companhia das Letras]] (1986), among others.

With the death of Lacerda, his sons Sergio and Sebastian took over.

* '''Editora Abril'''

[[Editora Abril]] was responsible for the success of a kind of book sold on newsstands: the edition in fascicles (a section of a book or set of books being published in installments as separate pamphlets or volumes). [[Editora Abril]] was founded by [[Victor Civita]] and his friend [[Giordano Rossi]] in 1950, initially as a magazine publisher. It started with [[Donald Duck]], working with the [[Walt Disney]] organization, and their first venture in the book market was in 1965, with an illustrated edition of the [[Holy Bible]], in fortnightly installments, followed by others of general interest. The growth and acceptance it received were outstanding, and in 1974, its fascicles on philosophy, [[Os Pensadores]] (The Thinkers) of which it sold 100,000 copies a week. In 1982, they launched [[Os Economistas]], including 20 titles that had never been published before in Portuguese.

* '''The current situation of reading in Brazil'''
The National Union of Book Publishers (Sindicato Nacional dos Editores de Livros, SNEL), the Brazilian Book Chamber (Câmara Brasileira do Livro, CBL), the Brazilian Association of Book Publishers (Associação Brasileira de Editores de Livros, ABRELIVROS) and the Brazilian Association of Pulp and Paper (Associação Brasileira de Celulose e Papel, BRACELPA)  research the reading habits of Brazilians and provide information for planning the market and public policies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snel.org.br/ui/pesquisaMercado/retratoLeitura.aspx Sindicato Nacional dos Editores de Livros] (consulta: 28/07/10)&lt;/ref&gt; and currently has about 659 publishers registered.

A survey by the Associação Nacional de Livrarias (ANL), available on July 27, 2010, shows that in the country there are currently 2980 stores - 11% more than there were in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anl.org.br/web/news/noticia_09.html Associação Nacional de Livrarias] (consulta:28/07/10)&lt;/ref&gt; The ANL points out, however, that the Brazilians read only 1.9 books per year, which falls short of the average in other Latin American countries. [[Vitor Tavares]], president of the ANL, gives examples: "In [[Argentina]], we read about five. In [[Chile]], three. In [[Colombia]], reads 2.5 books a year. " Also according to Tavares, "More and more libraries are opened in big cities but in towns of up to 80,000 inhabitants, often there is no selling point." Also according to the ANL, the southeastern region has the largest number of shops; [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], with 864 retailers specializing in books, has more than twice the second place, followed by [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. The Paraná is in fifth place in number of bookstores. Bahia has the largest number of bookstores in the Northeast, and the sixth in the country, tied with [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]; [[Roraima]], despite having only 25 bookstores has, proportionally, in the North, the best national average.&lt;ref&gt;Vitor Tavares, presidente da ANL.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Survey ==
On 23 July 2010, the [[Valor Econômico]] newspaper held a poll with a group of critics and teachers to identify what is the best publisher in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;FERRARI, Mário, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the [[Companhia das Letras]] showing up in the first place (81%), and the Cosac Naify at second (76%). In the third spot were Editora 34, Martins Fontes and Record; in fourth was Editora UFMG; in fifth Ateliê Editorial, Editora Hedra, Editora Iluminuras, Editora da Unicamp;&lt;ref&gt;ALVES FILHO, Manuel, 2010, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and in the sixth spot Contraponto Editora, Difel, Edusp, Editora Escrituras, Editora Perspectiva, UnB, Editora Vozes, WMF Martins Fontes, Zahar Editores.

The survey conducted by the newspaper did not aim to measure business efficiency, but to focus on publishers who stand out culturally. Voting started with an emphasis on artistic and literary areas and the humanities, and the ability to intervene in the cultural life and to form readers with the criteria if measuring the quality of a publisher. The 21 experts surveyed were asked to name the best three publishing houses. The more specialized areas were excluded, such as technical books, self-help, textbooks and supplementary teaching material.

'''''La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France''''' (Prose of the Trans-Siberian and of Little Jehanne of France) is a collaborative [[Artist's book|artists' book]] by [[Blaise Cendrars]] and [[Sonia Delaunay-Terk]]. The book features a poem by Cendrars about a journey through [[Russia]] on the [[Trans-Siberian Express]] in 1905, during the first [[Russian Revolution (1905)|Russian Revolution]], interlaced with an almost-abstract [[pochoir]] print by Delaunay-Terk. The work, published in 1913, is considered a milestone in the evolution of artist's books&lt;ref&gt;The Century of Artists' Books, Drucker, Granary, 1994, p50&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[modernist poetry]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grasslimb.com/sallis/GlobeColumns/globe.07.cendrars.html James Sallis, Boston Globe]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[abstract art]].

The publisher of a 2008 reprint of the book has called it "one of the most beautiful books ever created".&lt;ref&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300141894 Yale University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Cendrars himself referred to the work as ‘a sad poem printed on sunlight’.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Prose du Transsibérien, Chris Michaelides, British Library Podcast transcribed [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/breakingtherules/images/btrtranssiberien.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cendrars and the New Man Press==
Blaise Cendrars was the nom-de-plume for Fréderic Louis Sauser, a play on Braise (ember) and Cendres (ash); 'writing is being burned alive, but it also means being reborn from the ashes'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.nl/en/themes/koopman-collection/le-panama-ou-les-aventures-de-mes-sept-oncles-poeme Quoted in Koninklijke Bibliotheek, Netherlands Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Switzerland, at 15 he had run away from home  to train as an apprentice jeweller in [[St Petersburg]], but continued to travel, including an important stay in New York where he wrote his first major poem ''Les Pâques à New York'', 1912, before settling in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parisreview.org/media/4388_CENDRARS.pdf Interview with Cendrars, 1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110012434/http://parisreview.org/media/4388_CENDRARS.pdf |date=2007-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in [[Paris]], he started a small press, ''Éditions des Hommes Nouveaux'' (New Man Editions) with the help of an anarchist who owned a clandestine printing press at the Mouzaïa Quarter, 19th arrondissement. His first edition, 125 copies of ''Les Pâques à New York'', was published October 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parisreview.org/media/4388_CENDRARS.pdf Interview with Blaise Cendrars, Paris Review, p15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110012434/http://parisreview.org/media/4388_CENDRARS.pdf |date=2007-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite failing to sell a single copy, he pressed ahead with the second book, ''La prose du Transsibérien'', published June 1913 (see [[1913 in poetry]]). Intended as an edition of 150, only 60 copies were printed, of which about 30 are thought to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Enrichement de la Bibliotheque nationale 1961-73, quoted in Sims Reed Rare Books, Dada Futurism etc, 2008 p40&lt;/ref&gt; The book, a series of 4 sheets glued together in an accordion-style binding, measures 199&amp;nbsp;cm tall when unfolded; the height of all 150 end to end would have equalled the height of the [[Eiffel Tower]], a potent symbol of modernity at the time, and referenced in both the poem and the print.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[The poem] describes the 16-year old poet’s epic, perhaps imaginary, train journey from Moscow to Harbin (in Mongolia) during the Russo-Japanese War and the Russian Revolution of 1905. The route is shown on the contemporary map printed at the top right of the sheet. It is a long, oppressive ride through Russia with apocalyptic scenes of war and revolution, and descriptions of cold, hunger, death and devastation which worsen as the train follows its eastward course and are punctuated by the repeated, melancholy question of Jehanne, the poet's companion, "Dis Blaise, sommes nous bien loin de Montmartre?" (Blaise, are we very far from Montmartre?')"  Chris Michaelides&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/breakingtherules/images/btrtranssiberien.pdf Podcast by Chris Michaelides, British Library, transcribed at]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book is an early example of the deliberate use of multiple [[fonts]] - twelve in all - in different sizes and colours to suggest movement and differing moods, contemporaneous to similar experiments by the [[Futurism|Italian futurists]]. It is also unusual for 'defying the [[codex]] form'&lt;ref&gt;The Century of Artist's Books, Drucker, Granary, 1995 p51&lt;/ref&gt; and for placing the images on an equal footing to the text; they run parallel and complementary to the text, rather than as illustrative or decorative additions.

==Simultaneity and the Parisian Avant-Garde==
[[File:Trans-SiberianProse.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France'' 1913]]
[[File:Transsiberien.jpg|thumb|The last section of ''La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France'' featuring the Eiffel Tower, 1913]]
It was through [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], a mutual friend, that Cendrars was to meet Sonia and her husband [[Robert Delaunay]], members of the Parisian avant-garde, leading exponents of [[cubism]], and inventors of the term ''Simultaneity''.

The Delaunays had coined the word from their study of [[Michel-Eugène Chevreul|Chevreul's]] laws of simultaneous contrast.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KmEDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA150&amp;dq=The+Chevreul+Illusion&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#PPA3-IA1,M2 Chevreul's Law of Simultaneous Contrast of Colours]&lt;/ref&gt; This new style had first appeared in April 1912 with Robert Delaunay's series of paintings of ''Fenêtres'' (Windows) followed closely by Sonia's abstract ''Contrastes Simultanés'' and was boldly taken up by both husband and wife for the rest of their careers. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The intensity of the colour field is heightened in accordance with the law of simultaneous contrast: orange seen next to green becomes more red, while green seen next to orange appears more blue. These constant two-way influences create an unusual vibration in the eye of the viewer. Delaunay read this phenomenon as movement and rhythm and understood it as the painting appropriate to a modern society in motion."&lt;ref&gt;Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Düchting, Taschen 1994, p35&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The series of ''Windows'', with their use of the Eiffel Tower as the central theme, were a direct influence on Sonia's contributions to the poem; again, the eye was supposed to move between elements of the picture and the words creating a sensation of speed and disorientation that echoed the poem's theme of travel. The book is contained in a wrapper which declares it the "first simultaneous book'. It also contains a map of Siberia at the beginning of the book, showing the route of the train journey.

==Reception of the Book==
[[File:Delaunay-Windows.jpg|thumb|''Simultaneous Windows on the City'', 1912, by Robert Delaunay, Hamburger Kunsthalle]]
When published, the book was to cause a sensation in the avant-garde circles in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Düchting, Taschen 1994, p38&lt;/ref&gt; Many, if not most, of the surviving copies are now held by major museums and libraries, including the [[V&amp;A]], [[Tate Modern]], [[MoMA]], the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], [[Swiss National Library]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Swiss National Library]].

'''Mary Agnes Meara Chase''' (April 29, 1869 – September 24, 1963) was an [[Americans|American]] [[botanist]] who worked at the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] and the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. She is "considered one of the world's outstanding agrostologists"&lt;ref name="SIA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Historical note |url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_216795 |work=SIA RU000229, United States National Museum Division of Grasses, Records, 1884, 1888, 1899-1965 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Archives |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chase |first=Agnes |author2=A.S.

==Life and career==
[[File:Mary Agnes Chase Collecting Plants, Brazil, Image ID 96-548.tif|thumbnail|left|upright|Mary Agnes Chase collecting plants in Brazil, 1929&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_9227 |title=Mary Agnes Chase Collecting Plants, Brazil |work=Smithsonian Institution Archives |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Chase was born in [[Iroquois County, Illinois]] and held no formal education beyond grammar school. Chase made significant contributions to the field of botany, authored over 70 scientific publications, and was conferred with an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Illinois.&lt;ref name="SIA" /&gt; She specialized in the study of grasses and conducted extensive field work in North and South America. Her field books from 1897 to 1959 are archived in the [[Smithsonian Institution Archives]].

In 1893, Mary had visited the Colombian Exposition in Chicago with her nephew, who was a botanist, and this had inspired her to study plants in Northern Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Chase, Mary Agnes (1869-1963)|url=http://plants.jstor.org/stable/10.5555/al.ap.person.bm000001409|language=en|publisher=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, Chase became a botanical assistant at the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] under [[Charles Frederick Millspaugh]], where her work was featured in two museum publications: [http://www.worldcat.org/title/plantae-utowanae/oclc/81635904 ''Plantae Utowanae''] (1900) and [http://www.worldcat.org/title/plantae-yucatanae-regionis-antillanae-plants-of-the-insular-coastal-and-plain-regions-of-the-peninsula-of-yucatan-mexico-1-compositae/oclc/165891529 ''Plantae Yucatanae''] (1904).&lt;ref name="notewomen"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Sicherman |editor-first=Barbara |title=Notable American women: The modern period: A biographical dictionary |year=1980 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=146–148 |author=Carol Hurd Green, ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Chase joined the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) as a [[botanical illustrator]] and eventually became a scientific assistant in [[Agrostology|systematic agrostology]] (1907), assistant botanist (1923), and associate botanist (1925), all under [[A. S. Hitchcock|Albert Spear Hitchcock]]. Chase worked with Hitchcock for almost twenty years, collaborating closely and also publishing (''[http://www.worldcat.org/title/north-american-species-of-panicum/oclc/3764987 The North American Species of Panicum]'' [1910]).&lt;ref name="SIA" /&gt;

Following Hitchcock's death in 1936, Chase succeeded him to become senior botanist in charge of systematic agrostology and custodian of the Section of Grasses, Division of Plants at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s [[United States National Museum]] (USNM). Chase retired from the USDA in 1939 but continued her work as custodian of the USNM grass herbarium until her death in 1963.

==Women's Suffrage Movement==
[[File:Two of Agnes Chases favorite subjects, Brazil.jpg|thumb|Two of Agnes Chases favorite photo subjects, Brazil, 1924 or 25.]]
Chase experienced discrimination based on her gender in the scientific field, for example, being excluded from expeditions to Panama in 1911 and 1912 because the expedition's benefactors feared the presence of women researchers would distract men.&lt;ref name=AfterVote&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Katherine H. |title=After the vote was won: The later achievements of fifteen suffragists |year=2010 |publisher=McFarland |pages=73–74 |author2=Michael L. Keene}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], Chase marched with [[Alice Paul]] and was jailed several times for her activities. In 1918, she was arrested at the [[Silent Sentinels]] rally picketing the [[White House]]; she refused bail and was held for 10 days, where she instigated a hunger-strike and was force-fed.&lt;ref name=AfterVote /&gt; The USDA accused her of "conduct unbecoming a government employee," but Hitchcock helped her keep her job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henson |first=Pamela M. |year=2003 |title='What holds the earth together': Agnes Chase and American agrostology |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=36 |issue=3 | doi = 10.1023/b:hist.0000004568.11609.2d |pages=437–460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chase was also an active member of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wedin |first=Walter F. |author2=Steven L.

The '''Northeast Minneapolis Arts Association''' (or '''NEMAA''') is a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization of [[artist]]s and allies in [[Northeast, Minneapolis|Northeast Minneapolis]] in the U.S. state of [[Minnesota]]. NEMAA works to build a more vibrant, diverse and economically healthy community through the arts. NEMAA's vision is to support a community where artists can live, work, and showcase their art. And the mission is to promote connections between individuals, businesses and artists for the collective benefit of our community.

Founded by a small [[collective]] of artists in 1995, today NEMAA has more than 1000 members including artists, students, community friends, non-profit organizations, art galleries, and business members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History - Northeast Minneapolis Arts Association - NEMAA|url=https://nemaa.org/about/history/|website=Northeast Minneapolis Arts Association - NEMAA|accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEMAA's most visible event is Art-A-Whirl, the largest annual open artist studio tour in the U.S., held since 1996.&lt;ref name=rivera2017&gt;Rivera, Erica. A total eclipse of the art? ''Star Tribune'', May 19, 2017, [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20045550/northeast_minneapolis_arts_association/ page E1] and [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20045672/northeast_minneapolis_arts_association/ page E12]. Retrieved May 13, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; During the event artists open their studios to the public, and other performing, visual and educational groups have special art events all around the neighborhoods of Northeast. In 2017, more than 600 artists in 50 locations participated.&lt;ref name=rivera2017 /&gt;

NEMAA publishes an annual Artist Directory and Guide, a year-round guide for visitors to Northeast Minneapolis, Art-A-Whirl, and other arts happenings. NEMAA also coordinates the Fall Fine Arts Show to showcase the artwork of NEMAA artist members. In addition, NEMAA promotes members, artists, and events year-round, including monthly open studio events such as First Thursdays in the Arts District, First Fridays at Q.arma Building, and Saturdays at California Building.

NEMAA was instrumental in establishing the Northeast [[Mississippi River]] on the west, Broadway on the south, Central Avenue on the east, and 27th Avenue on the north.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5027">{{distinguish|The Old Wives' Tale (play)}}
An '''old wives' tale''' is a supposed truth which is actually spurious or a superstition. It can be said sometimes to be a type of [[urban legend]], said to be passed down by older women to a younger generation. Such tales are considered [[superstition]], [[folklore]] or unverified claims with exaggerated and/or inaccurate details. Old wives' tales often center on women's traditional concerns, such as [[pregnancy]], [[puberty]], [[social relations]], [[health]], [[herbalism]] and [[nutrition]].

== Origins ==
In this context, the word ''wife'' means "woman" rather than "married woman". This usage stems from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|{{wt|ang|wif}}}}'' ("woman") and is akin to the [[German language|German]] ''{{linktext|Weib|lang=de}}'' (also meaning "woman"). This sense of the word is still used in [[Modern English]] in constructions such as ''[[midwife]]'' and ''[[fishwife]]''.

Old wives' tales are often invoked to discourage certain behaviors, usually of children, or to share knowledge of [[traditional medicine|folk cures]] for ailments ranging from [[toothaches]] to [[dysentery]].

The concept of old wives' tales has existed for centuries. In 1611, the [[King James Bible]] was published with the following translation of the [[Apostle Paul]] writing to his young protégé [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], "But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness" ([[I Timothy]] 4:7 [[KJV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=1Ti&amp;c=4&amp;v=7&amp;t=KJV#7|title=1 Timothy 4:7 (KJV)|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== The oral tradition ===

Old wives' tales originate in the oral tradition of storytelling. They were generally propagated by illiterate women, telling stories to each other or to children. The stories do not attempt to moralise, but to teach lessons and make difficult concepts like death or [[coming of age]] easy for children to understand. These stories are also used to scare children so they don't do certain things.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 15 May 2010, Greer, Germaine. "Grandmother's footsteps" http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/may/15/germaine-greer-old-wives-tales&lt;/ref&gt;

These tales have often been collected by literate men, and turned into written works. Fairy tales by [[Giambattista Basile|Basile]], [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]], and the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimms]] have their roots in the oral tradition of women. These male writers took the stories from women, with their plucky, clever heroines and heroes, and turned them into [[morality tale]]s for children.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, Jack. ''The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood'', Routledge, 1993 {{ISBN|0-415-90834-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of old wives' tales ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
Examples of old wives' tales include:

* Masturbation will make you blind and have hairy palms.
* Ice cream leads to nightmares.
* Toes pointed up signify low [[blood sugar]].
* Letting a wound "dry out" is the proper [[wound care|treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/health/01real.html|title=The Claim: Wounds Heal Better When Exposed to Air|first=Anahad|last=O’Connor|date=1 August 2006|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cracking knuckles]] gives arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;Swezey, Robert L., and Stuart E. Swezey. "The consequences of habitual knuckle cracking" ''Western Journal of Medicine'' 122.5 (1975): 377.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Donald L. "Does knuckle cracking lead to arthritis of the fingers?" ''Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism'' 41.5 (1998): 949–950.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* High heart rates lead to female fetuses.
* Swimming with full stomach causes cramps and that one should wait an hour after eating before swimming.
* Don't swallow gum or it will stay in your stomach for seven years.
* Don't make silly faces or it will make the silly face permanent.
* Chocolate leads to acne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukehealth.org/health_library/health_articles/myth-or-fact-eating-chocolate-causes-acne|title=Blog - Duke Health|website=www.dukehealth.org|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shaving makes the hair grow back thicker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/adult-health/expert-answers/hair-removal/faq-20058427|title=Does shaved hair grow back thicker?|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eating crusts (of a [[sandwich bread|sandwich]]) makes your hair go curly/you grow hair on your chest.
* The appearance of white spots on the fingernails ([[leukonychia]]) is due to lying or not eating enough green vegetables/calcium.

[[File:Igreja de Campanha Azulejo 4.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tile|Tilings]], such as these from [[:pt:Igreja de Campanhã|Igreja de Campanhã]], Porto, [[Portugal]], are visual patterns used for decoration.]]

A '''pattern''' is a regularity in the world, man-made design, or abstract ideas. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. A '''geometric pattern''' is a kind of pattern formed of [[geometry|geometric]] [[shape]]s and typically repeated like a [[wallpaper]] design.

Any of the [[sense]]s may directly observe patterns. Conversely, abstract patterns in [[science]], [[mathematics]], or [[language]] may be observable only by analysis. Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art. Visual [[patterns in nature]] are often [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], never exactly repeating, and often involve [[fractals]]. Natural patterns include [[spirals]], [[meander]]s, [[wave]]s, [[foam]]s, [[tessellation|tilings]], [[fracture|cracks]], and those created by [[Symmetry|symmetries]] of [[rotation symmetry|rotation]] and [[reflection symmetry|reflection]]. Patterns have an underlying [[Mathematics|mathematical]] structure;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, 2001. Page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities, and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern. Similarly in the sciences, theories explain and predict regularities in the world.

In art and architecture, decorations or [[Motif (visual arts)|visual motifs]] may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer. In computer science, a [[software design pattern]] is a known solution to a class of problems in programming. In fashion, the pattern is a [[Die (manufacturing)|template]] used to create any number of similar garments.

Nature provides examples of many kinds of pattern, including [[symmetry|symmetries]], trees and other structures with a [[fractal]] dimension, [[spirals]], [[meander]]s, [[wave]]s, [[foam]]s, [[tessellation|tilings]], [[fracture|cracks]] and stripes.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Peter. ''Patterns in Nature'', 1974. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symmetry ===

[[File:Schnee1.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Snowflake]] [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]]]

Symmetry is widespread in living things. Animals that move usually have bilateral or [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]] as this favours movement.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Pages 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], as do many flowers, as well as animals which are largely static as adults, such as [[sea anemone]]s. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [[echinoderms]], including [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Pages 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among non-living things, [[snowflake]]s have striking [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]: each flake is unique, its structure recording the varying conditions during its crystallisation similarly on each of its six arms.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crystal]]s have a highly specific set of possible [[crystal habit|crystal symmetries]]; they can be cubic or octahedral, but cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike [[quasicrystals]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Pages 82-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spirals ===

[[File:Aloe polyphylla spiral.jpg|thumb|75px|''[[Aloe polyphylla]]'' [[phyllotaxis]]]]

Spiral patterns are found in the body plans of animals including [[molluscs]] such as the [[nautilus]], and in the [[phyllotaxis]] of many plants, both of leaves spiralling around stems, and in the multiple spirals found in flowerheads such as the [[sunflower]] and fruit structures like the [[pineapple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/1904/19040335.pdf | title=Growth in Plants: A Study in Number | author=Kappraff, Jay | journal=Forma | year=2004 | volume=19 | pages=335–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chaos, flow, meanders ===
[[File:Vortex-street-1-90deg.jpg|thumb|85px|[[Vortex street]] turbulence]]

[[Chaos theory]] predicts that while the laws of [[physics]] are [[deterministic]], events and patterns in nature never exactly repeat because extremely small differences in starting conditions can lead to widely differing outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Chaos |author1=Crutchfield, James P |author2=Farmer, J Doyne, |author3=Packard, Norman H |author4=Shaw, Robert S | journal=Scientific American |date=December 1986 | volume=254 | issue=12 | pages=46–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many natural patterns are shaped by this apparent randomness, including [[vortex street]]s&lt;ref&gt;von Kármán, Theodore. ''Aerodynamics''. McGraw-Hill (1963): {{ISBN|978-0070676022}}. Dover (1994): {{ISBN|978-0486434858}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and other effects of turbulent flow such as [[meander]]s in rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jacques | last=Lewalle | title=Lecture Notes in Incompressible Fluid Dynamics: Phenomenology, Concepts and Analytical Tools | chapter=Flow Separation and Secondary Flow: Section 9.1 | url=http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | year=2006 | location=Syracuse, NY | publisher=Syracuse University | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929075022/http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-29 | df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Waves, dunes ===
[[File:Sand dune ripples.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Dune]] [[Capillary wave|ripple]]]]

[[Wave]]s are disturbances that carry energy as they move. [[Mechanical wave]]s propagate through a medium – air or water, making it [[Oscillation|oscillate]] as they pass by.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P. ''Vibrations and Waves''. Nelson Thornes, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind wave]]s are [[surface wave]]s that create the chaotic patterns of the sea. As they pass over sand, such waves create patterns of ripples; similarly, as the wind passes over sand, it creates patterns of [[dune]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=H.L. | last=Tolman | contribution=Practical wind wave modeling | title=CBMS Conference Proceedings on Water Waves: Theory and Experiment | year=2008 | location=Howard University, USA, 13–18 May 2008 | publisher=World Scientific Publ. | url=http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn270/Howard_08.pdf | editor-first=M.F. | editor-last=Mahmood}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Bubbles, foam ===

[[File:Foam - big.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Foam]] of [[soap bubble]]s]]

[[Foam]]s obey [[Plateau's laws]], which require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant [[mean curvature|average curvature]]. Foam and bubble patterns occur widely in nature, for example in [[radiolarian]]s, [[sponge]] [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s, and the skeletons of [[silicoflagellate]]s and [[sea urchin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball. ''Shapes'', 2009. pp 68, 96-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and [[Jean E. Taylor]], ''The geometry of soap films and soap bubbles'', Scientific American, vol. 235, pp. 82–93, July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Cracks ===
[[File:Cracked earth in the Rann of Kutch.jpg|thumb|75px|Shrinkage [[Fracture|Cracks]]]]

[[Fracture|Crack]]s form in materials to relieve stress: with 120 degree joints in elastic materials, but at 90 degrees in inelastic materials. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. Cracking patterns are widespread in nature, for example in rocks, mud, tree bark and the glazes of old paintings and ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Peter. 1974. Page 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spots, stripes===

''Shapes''. 2009. Pages 159–167.&lt;/ref&gt; These  [[spatiotemporal pattern]]s slowly drift, the animals' appearance changing imperceptibly as Turing predicted.

{{further|Mathematics and art|Mathematics and architecture}}

=== Tilings ===
{{further|Tessellation|Tile}}

In visual art, pattern consists in regularity which in some way "organizes surfaces or structures in a consistent, regular manner." At its simplest, a pattern in art may be a geometric or other repeating shape in a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[tapestry]], ceramic [[Tile|tiling]] or [[carpet]], but a pattern need not necessarily repeat exactly as long as it provides some form or organizing "skeleton" in the artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://char.txa.cornell.edu/language/element/pattern/pattern.htm | title=Art, Design, and Visual Thinking | publisher=Cornell University | work=Pattern | year=1995 | accessdate=12 December 2012 | author=Jirousek, Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mathematics, a [[tessellation]] is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes (which mathematicians call tiles), with no overlaps and no gaps.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum&gt;{{cite book|last=Grünbaum|first=Branko|title=Tilings and Patterns|year=1987|publisher=W. H. Freeman|location=New York|author2=Shephard, G. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In architecture===
[[Image:Hampi1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Patterns in architecture: the Virupaksha temple at Hampi has a [[fractal]]-like structure where the parts resemble the whole.]]
{{main|Pattern (architecture)|Mathematics and architecture}}

In architecture, [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] are repeated in various ways to form patterns. Most simply, structures such as windows can be repeated horizontally and vertically (see leading picture). Architects can use and repeat decorative and structural elements such as [[column]]s, [[pediment]]s, and [[lintel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of Western Art | publisher=McGraw Hill | author=Adams, Laurie | year=2001 | page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repetitions need not be identical; for example, temples in South India have a roughly pyramidal form, where elements of the pattern repeat in a [[fractal]]-like way at different sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Heaven's Fractal Net: Retrieving Lost Visions in the Humanities | publisher=Indiana University Press | author=Jackson, William Joseph | year=2004 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science and mathematics ==
[[File:Fractal fern explained.png|thumb|upright|Fractal model of a fern illustrating [[self-similar]]ity]]

[[Mathematics]] is sometimes called the "Science of Pattern", in the sense of rules that can be applied wherever needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2214851?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101539380483 | title=Mathematics as a Science of Patterns: Ontology and Reference | author=Resnik, Michael D. | journal=Noûs |date=November 1981 | volume=15 | issue=4 | pages=529–550 | doi=10.2307/2214851}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, any [[sequence]] of numbers that may be modeled by a mathematical function can be considered a pattern. Mathematics can be taught as a collection of patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coas.howard.edu/mathematics/faculty/bayne/patterns.html | title=MATH 012 Patterns in Mathematics - spring 2012 | year=2012 | accessdate=16 January 2013 | author=Bayne, Richard E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fractals ===

Some mathematical rule-patterns can be visualised, and among these are those that explain [[patterns in nature]] including the mathematics of symmetry, waves, meanders, and fractals. [[Fractal]]s are mathematical patterns that are scale invariant. This means that the shape of the pattern does not depend on how closely you look at it. [[Self-similarity]] is found in fractals. Examples of natural fractals are coast lines and tree shapes, which repeat their shape regardless of what magnification you view at. While self-similar patterns can appear indefinitely complex, the rules needed to describe or produce their [[pattern formation|formation]] can be simple (e.g. [[Lindenmayer system]]s describing [[tree]] shapes).&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît B. |authorlink=Benoît Mandelbrot |title=The fractal geometry of nature
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0R2LkE3N7-oC |year=1983| publisher=Macmillan
|isbn=978-0-7167-1186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pattern theory]], devised by [[Ulf Grenander]], mathematicians attempt to describe the world in terms of patterns. The goal is to lay out the world in a more computationally friendly manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Pattern Theory: From Representation to Inference | publisher=Oxford University Press |author1=Grenander, Ulf |author2=Miller, Michael | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the broadest sense, any regularity that can be explained by a scientific theory is a pattern. As in mathematics, science can be taught as a set of patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/smg/Website/UCP/ | title=Causal Patterns in Science | publisher=Harvard Graduate School of Education | year=2008 | accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer science ==

In computer science, a [[software design pattern]], in the sense of a [[Template method pattern|template]], is a general solution to a problem in programming. A design pattern provides a reusable architectural outline that may speed the development of many computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;Gamma et al, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fashion ==
{{main|Pattern (sewing)}}
In fashion, the pattern is a [[Die (manufacturing)|template]], a technical two-dimensional tool used to create any number of identical garments. It can be considered as a means of translating from the drawing to the real garment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Artist Centric Marketplace for Fashion Sketch Templates, Croquis &amp; More|url=https://illustratorstuff.com/|publisher=Illustrator Stuff|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Photography Biennale of the contemporary Arab world''' is a cultural event, established by the [[Arab World Institute]] and the [[Maison européenne de la photographie]] (European Photography Institute) whose aim is to develop a unique panorama of the contemporary photographers operating in – and on – the [[Arab world]] since the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Photography as art in the Arab world|last = |first = |date = November 2015|journal = The Art Newspaper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = À Paris, l'Orient voit le jour|last = Mercier|first = Clémentine|date = 7 December 2015|journal = Libération|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First edition ==
Curated by Gabriel Bauret, the first edition took place from 11 November 2016 to 17 January 2017 and aimed at showcasing a range of diverse images and points of view, between the [[Arab world]] and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Event|last = Mouneyres|first = Pascal|date = November 2015|journal = Paris Worldwide|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event took place in the [[4th arrondissement of Paris|4th arrondissement]] of Paris, between the [[Arab World Institute]] and the [[Maison européenne de la photographie]] and six others places, such as the Cité Internationale des Arts of Paris, the Mairie du 4ème arrondissement, [[Galerie Photo12|Photo12 Galerie]], Galerie Basia Embiricos, Galerie Boa and Graine de Photographe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Arab photography gets a Biennale|last = Grey|first = Tobias|date = 7 November 2015|journal = The Wall Street Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next edition will be held in November 2017.

== Photographers represented ==
For this first edition, the Biennale presented works signed by about 50 artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/12/arts/paris-arab-biennial/|title = Why Paris' first festival of Arab photography is more important than ever|date = 12 January 2016|access-date = |website = edition.cnn.com|publisher = |last = Snaije|first = Olivia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars would agree that [[modernism]] began around 1900 and continued on as the dominant cultural force in the intellectual circles of Western culture well into the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Compare, for example:&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Peter|title=Modernism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41544-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v8SXB4l7kcC|page=18}}: "[modernism] is [...] primarily located in the years 1890-1930 [...]"&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Tim|title=Modernism: A Cultural History|publisher=[[Polity Press]]|location=Cambridge|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7456-2983-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3k_C-1NZ4YYC&amp;dq=isbn=0-7456-2983-0|page=24}}: "[modernism] can be defined as a series of international artistic movements in the period 1900-40 [...]."&lt;/ref&gt; Like all eras, modernism encompasses many competing individual directions and is impossible to define as a discrete unity or totality. However, its chief general characteristics are often thought to include an emphasis on "radical aesthetics, technical experimentation, spatial or rhythmic, rather than chronological form, [and] self-conscious reflexiveness"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Peter|title=Modernism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41544-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v8SXB4l7kcC|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the search for authenticity in human relations, abstraction in art, and utopian striving. These characteristics are normally lacking in postmodernism or are treated as objects of irony.
{{Postmodernism}}
[[Postmodernism]] arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with [[totalitarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Groys, Boris: ''The Total Art of Stalinism'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what we now call postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref&gt;See Barth, John: “[[The Literature of Exhaustion]].” ''The Atlantic Monthly'', August 1967, pp. 29-34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., for example, Huyssen, Andreas: ''After the Great Divide. Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, postmodernism has been a dominant, though not undisputed, force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and continental philosophy. Salient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels,&lt;ref&gt;See Hutcheon, Linda: ''A Poetics of Postmodernism. History, Theory, Fiction''. New York: Routledge, 1988, pp. 3-21; McHale, Brian: ''Postmodern Fiction'', London: Methuen, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; a metaphysical skepticism or [[nihilism]] towards a "[[grand narrative]]" of  Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;See Lyotard, Jean-François, ''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'', Minneapolis: University of Minneapolis Press 1984&lt;/ref&gt; a preference for the virtual at the expense of the real (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes)&lt;ref&gt;See Baudrillard, Jean: “[[Simulacra and Simulation]]s.” In: ''Jean Baudrillard. Selected Writings''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1988, pp. 166-184.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "waning of affect"&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; on the part of the subject, who is caught up in the free interplay of virtual, endlessly reproducible signs inducing a state of consciousness similar to schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s there has been a small but growing feeling both in popular culture and in academia that postmodernism "has gone out of fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Garry and Lopez, Jose (eds.): ''After Postmodernism: An Introduction to Critical Realism''. London: The Athlone Press 2001, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been few formal attempts to define and name the era succeeding postmodernism, and none of the proposed designations has yet become part of mainstream usage.

==Definitions==
Consensus on what constitutes an era can not be easily achieved while that era is still in its early stages. However, a common theme of current attempts to define post-postmodernism is emerging as one where faith, trust, dialogue, performance, and sincerity can work to transcend postmodern [[irony]]. The following definitions, which vary widely in depth, focus, and scope, are listed in the chronological order of their appearance.

===Turner's ''post-postmodernism''===
In 1995, the landscape architect and urban planner [[Tom Turner]] issued a book-length call for a post-postmodern turn in urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Turner criticizes the postmodern credo of “anything goes” and suggests that “the built environment professions are witnessing the gradual dawn of a post-Postmodernism that seeks to temper reason with faith.”&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Turner argues for the use of timeless organic and geometrical patterns in urban planning. As sources of such patterns he cites, among others, the Taoist-influenced work of the American architect [[Christopher Alexander]], [[gestalt psychology]]  and the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]]’s concept of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]. Regarding terminology, Turner urges us to “embrace post-Postmodernism – and pray for a better name.”&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995), p. 10; see also a summary of the book at [http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/architecture_city_as_landscape]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epstein's ''trans-postmodernism''===
In his 1999 book on [[Russian postmodernism]] the Russian-American Slavist [[Mikhail Epstein]] suggested that postmodernism  “is […] part of a much larger historical formation,” which he calls “[[postmodernity]].”&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein believes that postmodernist aesthetics will eventually become entirely conventional and provide the foundation for a new, non-ironic kind of poetry, which he describes using the prefix "[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]":
{{quote|In considering the names that might possibly be used to designate the new era following "postmodernism," one finds that the prefix "trans" stands out in a special way. The last third of the 20th century developed under the sign of "post," which signalled the demise of such concepts of modernity as "truth" and "objectivity," "soul" and "subjectivity," "utopia" and "ideality," "primary origin" and "originality," "sincerity" and "sentimentality." All of these concepts are now being reborn in the form of "trans-subjectivity," "trans-idealism," "trans-utopianism," "trans-originality," "trans-lyricism," "trans-sentimentality" etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.focusing.org/apm_papers/epstein.html | title=Epstein (specific) - the Place of Postmodernism in Postmodernity}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As an example Epstein cites the work of the contemporary Russian poet [[Timur Kibirov]].&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, pp. 457-460&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gans' ''post-millennialism''===
The term ''post-millennialism'' was introduced in 2000 by the American cultural theorist [[Eric Gans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = The Post-Millennial Age | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 209 | date = June 3, 2000 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw209/ | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the era after postmodernism in ethical and socio-political terms. Gans associates postmodernism closely with "victimary thinking," which he defines as being based on a non-negotiable ethical opposition between perpetrators and victims arising out of the experience of [[Auschwitz]] and [[Hiroshima]]. In Gans's view, the ethics of postmodernism is derived from identifying with the peripheral victim and disdaining the utopian center occupied by the perpetrator. Postmodernism in this sense is marked by a victimary politics that is productive in its opposition to modernist utopianism and totalitarianism but unproductive in its resentment of capitalism and liberal democracy, which he sees as the long-term agents of global reconciliation. In contrast to postmodernism, post-millennialism is distinguished by the rejection of victimary thinking and a turn to "non-victimary dialogue"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Victimary Thinking Forever? | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 230 | date = March 31, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw230.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; that will "diminish […] the amount of resentment in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Moral Heroism | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 237 | date = June 9, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw237.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gans has developed the notion of post-millennialism further in many of his internet ''Chronicles of Love and Resentment''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Chronicles of Love and Resentment | work = Anthropoetics | publisher = [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date =  | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/Chronicles_home.cfm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}} }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term is allied closely with his theory of [[generative anthropology]] and his scenic concept of history.&lt;ref&gt;For more on both see Gans, Eric: ''Originary Thinking: Elements of Generative Anthropology''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kirby's ''pseudo-modernism'' or ''digimodernism''===
In his 2006 paper [[The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond]], the British scholar [[Alan Kirby (writer)|Alan Kirby]] formulated a socio-cultural assessment of post-postmodernism that he calls “pseudo-modernism.”&lt;ref name="philosophynow"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kirby | first = Alan | authorlink = Alan Kirby (writer)| title = The Death of Postmodernism And Beyond | journal = Philosophy Now | volume = | issue = 58 | date = November–December 2006 | language =  | url = http://www.philosophynow.org/issue58/58kirby.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby associates pseudo-modernism with the triteness and shallowness resulting from the instantaneous, direct, and superficial participation in culture made possible by the internet, mobile phones, interactive television and similar means: "In pseudo-modernism one phones, clicks, presses, surfs, chooses, moves, downloads."&lt;ref name="philosophynow" /&gt;

Pseudo-modernism's "typical intellectual states" are furthermore described as being "[[ignorance]], [[fanaticism]] and [[anxiety]]" and it is said to produce a "trance-like state" in those participating in it. The net result of this media-induced shallowness and instantaneous participation in trivial events is a "silent autism" superseding "the neurosis of modernism and the narcissism of postmodernism." Kirby sees no aesthetically valuable works coming out of "pseudo-modernism." As examples of its triteness he cites reality TV, interactive news programs, "the drivel found […] on some [[wikipedia|Wikipedia pages]]", docu-soaps, and the essayistic cinema of [[Michael Moore]] or [[Morgan Spurlock]].&lt;ref name="philosophynow"/&gt; In a book published in September 2009 titled ''Digimodernism: How New Technologies Dismantle the Postmodern and Reconfigure our Culture'', Kirby developed further and nuanced his views on culture and textuality in the aftermath of [[postmodernism]].

===Vermeulen and van den Akker's ''metamodernism''===
In 2010 the cultural theorists Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker introduced the term [[metamodernism]] &lt;ref name="journalofaestheticsandculture"&gt;Vermeulen, Timotheus and Robin van den Akker. "[http://aestheticsandculture.net/index.php/jac/article/view/5677/6304 Notes on metamodernism]", ''Journal of Aesthetics and Culture" 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as an intervention in the post-postmodernism debate. In their article 'Notes on metamodernism' they assert that the 2000s are characterized by the emergence of a sensibility that oscillates between, and must be situated beyond, modern positions and postmodern strategies. As examples of the metamodern sensibility Vermeulen and van den Akker cite the 'informed naivety', 'pragmatic idealism' and 'moderate fanaticism' of the various cultural responses to, among others, climate change, the financial crisis, and (geo)political instability.

The prefix 'meta' here refers not to some reflective stance or repeated rumination, but to Plato's ''[[metaxy]]'', which intends a movement between opposite poles as well as beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metamodernism.com/2010/10/14/what-meta-means-and-does-not-mean/ | title=What meta means and does not mean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nihâl Chand 001.jpg|thumb|220px|An 18th-century Rajput painting by the artist [[Nihâl Chand]].]]
[[File:Godhuli, Mewar, ca1813.jpg|thumb|''Godhuli'', [[Mewar]], ca. 1813]]
'''Rajput painting''', also called  '''Rajasthani painting''', evolved and flourished in the royal courts of [[Rajputana]] in [[India]].  Each Rajputana kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana. [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|Miniatures]] in manuscripts or single sheets to be kept in albums were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but many paintings were done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelis, particularly, the havelis of [[Shekhawati]], the forts and palaces built by [[Shekhawat]] Rajputs.

The colours were extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones.  Gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colours was a lengthy process, sometimes taking 2 weeks. Brushes used were very fine.

== Content ==
While there exist a plethora of themes in Rajput paintings, a common motif found throughout Rajput works is the purposeful manipulation of space. In particular, the inclusion of fuller spaces is meant to emphasize the lack of boundaries and inseparability of characters and landscapes. In this way, the individuality of physical characters is almost rejected, allowing both the depicted backgrounds and human figures to be equally expressive.

Outside of a purely artistic standpoint, Rajput paintings were often politically charged and commented on social values of the time. Mewar's rulers wanted these painting to portray their ambitions and establish their legacy. Therefore, paintings were often indicative of a ruler's legacy or their changes made to better society.

Both of these factors clearly distinguish Rajput paintings from Mughal works. While, from a chronological standpoint, both of these cultures clashed with one another, Rajput paintings only superficially adopted Mughal fashion and cultural standards. Elements, such as distinct portraiture, utilized by popular Mughal artists ([[Govardhan (Mughal painter)|Govardhan]], Hashim, etc.) are not found in Rajput works. Likewise, Rajput techniques are not predominantly seen in [[Mughal painting]]s. &lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;small&gt;"At the opening of the eighteenth century, therefore, Rajput painting remains recognizably different in intent from traditional Mughal attitudes" (Beach 175).&lt;/small&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the late 16th Century, Rajput art schools began to develop distinctive styles, combining indigenous as well as foreign influences such as Persian, Mughal, Chinese and European.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neeraj|first=Jai Singh|title=Splendour Of Rajasthani Painting|year=1991|publisher=Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|pages=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGjTjmL29VIC&amp;pg=PP15&amp;lpg=PP15&amp;dq=shekhawati+painting&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-1KPo1-Rmd&amp;sig=uBKBi0BtGlqniNoZhs8NxBjGbbs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=djcvUK6POdHRrQfRxIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=shekhawati%20painting&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajasthani painting consists of four principal schools that have within them several artistic styles and substyles that can be traced to the various princely states that patronised these artists. The four principal schools are:

The [[Kangra painting|Kangra]] and [[Kullu]] schools of art are also part of Rajput painting. [[Nainsukh]] is a famous artist of [[Pahari painting]], working for Rajput princes who then ruled that far north.

Economic prosperity of commercial community and revival of “Vaisnavism” and the growth of Bhakti Cult were the major factors that contributed greatly to the development of Rajasthani paintings. In the beginning this style was greatly influenced by religious followers like Ramanuja, Meerabai, Tulsidas, Sri Chaitanya, Kabir and Ramanand.

All of Rajputana was affected by the attack of the Mughals but Mewar did not come under their control till the last. This was the reason that Rajasthani school flourished first in Mewar, (the purest form and later on in), Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bundi, Kota- Kalam, Kishangarh, Bikaner and other places of Rajasthan.

'''The River's Edge Arts Alliance''', also known as the Hudson Area Arts Alliance, was organized in 1990 and incorporated on March 7, 1991.  The River's Edge Arts Alliance is a local, non-profit 501(c)(3) charitable organization which has been dedicated to promoting community arts, arts education and cultural enrichment for the past two decades.  The organization provides arts activities that appeal to a broad range of interests, age groups and backgrounds, the River's Edge Arts Alliance has positively impacted the region's cultural development by offering a wide spectrum of visual and performing art, while bringing people together to enjoy a variety of dynamic arts activities.  The River's Edge Arts Alliance presents musical performances, theater performances, art exhibits as well as offering education classes for children and adults in art, music and theater.  It promotes the growth of the arts in cities and towns in MetroWest Boston as well as Central Massachusetts.

== Location ==
The River's Edge Arts Alliance Office is located in the Hudson Public Schools Administration Building at 155 Apsley Street in [[Hudson, Massachusetts]].

== History ==
The concept of the River's Arts Alliance was developed in 1988 when local parents and teachers created an informal organization to increase cultural activities for school children and their families.  The Community Arts Series was created in 1988, followed by the Drama Workshop summer program in 1989. The River's Edge Arts Alliance was formed the following year to manage the Arts Series and Drama Workshop.  Visual art exhibits as well as a newsletter and arts calendar were developed.

Jan Patterson, a founding member of the River's Edge Arts Alliance, was hired as full-time executive director in 1993 through a grant from the Massachusetts Cultural Council.  After school classes, area arts meetings and other programs were added, and the River's Edge Arts Alliance became increasingly known at the regional level.   A program director was hired in 1998 with additional staff added in subsequent years.  The After School Band Lesson Program was developed in 1997 and the Focus on Kids! Series in Marlborough in 1999.  The following year the agency took over management of the Pro Musica Youth Chorus, now called the River's Edge Youth Chorus, and in 2002 the River's Edge Community Band was formed.  Art in the Hall, a series of individual artist exhibits at Hudson Town Hall, was developed in December 2003. The River's Edge Chorale was formed in 2005, followed by the River's Edge Players in 2006.

The River's Edge Arts Alliance fosters appreciation of the arts through education, performance, exhibition, promotion, and by serving as a resource for arts education, cultural groups, and artists in the area.  It serves children, parents, elders, artists, arts organizations, schools, and the population at large as it seeks to inspire deeper interest in all aspects of the arts, foster understanding and appreciation of cultural diversity, and integrate the arts more fully into individual and community life.
	
The organization effectively brings artists into the community while developing the artistic potential of those who live here.  Managed by a small staff, an active board of directors and many other enthusiastic volunteers, the Arts Alliance currently has 150 donors/sponsors and about 350 members from 35 area communities who are individuals, families, artists, organizations and businesses.  There are many other ways that individuals, businesses, organizations, municipalities and foundations support the River's Edge Arts Alliance. Making the arts flourish locally, this support demonstrates the value placed on the creative arts for the many ways they inspire and enrich our communities.
  
The River's Edge Arts Alliance offers a broad array of arts activities in which thousands of adults and children participate, often as families.  The River's Edge Arts Alliance is responsible for creating and sustaining many cultural activities and organizations including: Art in the Hall, Arts After School, Arts in the Park, Community Arts Series, Focus on the Arts, Hudson Band Lesson Program, Hudson Pathways, River's Edge Youth Chorus, River's Edge Chorale, River's Edge Community Band, River's Edge Players, Saturday Morning Discovery Series, Summer Arts, Summer Drama Workshop (now in its 25th year) and many visual arts exhibits.  These quality, yet affordable, events, exhibits and classes are held in Hudson and surrounding towns. In addition to its regular programming in performing arts, visual arts and arts education, the agency has participated in many collaborative and partnership initiatives.  Marlborough residents have participated in Arts Alliance programs since the beginning, and during the past thirteen years, the Arts Alliance has offered an increasing number of programs in the City.

Many community-minded people value creativity and the way it inspires our lives and improves the area's quality of life.  Thanks to the support of area individuals, organizations, businesses, municipalities and foundations that value the arts which so enrich our lives, many community members participate in these free or moderately-priced programs.  The organization believes in integrating the arts into everyday community life, as well as helping arts education thrive. It creates and sustains participant and performance opportunities.  The Arts Alliance collaborates with schools, arts organizations, businesses and artists, all the while bringing diverse people together.  The most critical factor in sustaining area arts programming is the active involvement of the community, people interested in making a difference in their community through the arts.

The Commonwealth Award is the state's highest honor in the arts, humanities and interpretive sciences.  These awards are presented every two years by the Massachusetts Cultural Council to honor individuals and organizations that have made extraordinary contributions to the quality of life, education, and economy in Massachusetts through arts and culture.  This prestigious honor was awarded to the River's Edge Arts Alliance at the State House in 1997.  In 1995 Aerosmith received the Catalyst award, an earlier version of the MCC's Creative Economy Award.  Other winners have included Doris Kearns Goodwin, David McCullough, Henry Hampton, Bradford Washburn, Dr. Stephen Jay Gould, DeCordova Museum &amp; Sculpture Park, Wheelock Family Theater, Greater Boston Youth Symphony Orchestras, North Bennet Street School, Massachusetts College of Art, Stanley Kunitz (10th US Poet Laureate,) Richard Yarde, Yo Yo Ma, Robert Brustein (American Repertory Theatre), Edmund Barry Gaither, Gunther Schuller, City of Pittsfield, Worcester Cultural Coalition and Peabody Essex Museum.

Each year the River's Edge Arts Alliance sponsors dozens of exciting, enriching and entertaining events, exhibits and educational workshops in Marlborough and Hudson, providing the public with numerous opportunities to experience quality arts programs that boost the cultural ambiance of the area.  It brough over thirteen years of bringing to Marlborough the quality cultural programming the Focus on the Arts Series (formerly named Focus on Kids) and Children's Theater Workshop performances.  For ten years, the popular Family Fun Festivals (formerly called The Saturday Morning Discovery Series), a program managed by the River's Edge Arts Alliance for the City of Marlborough, has offered some of the region's top performers presenting free performances on Union Common in the summer and at the Walker Building or Marlborough Senior Center in the winter.

The River's Arts Alliance's 20th anniversary was celebrated on January 16, 2010 with the "Taste of the Arts" Gala at the Hudson Public Library.  The Hudson Selectmen's proclamation was read by Sonny Parente, and [[Jamie Eldridge|Senator Jamie Eldridge]] and [[Kate Hogan|Representative Kate Hogan]] offered recognition from the State House.  Also on hand were a variety of musicians and visual artists who shared their work with the attendees as well as board members, staff and many community leaders and arts supporters.

The River's edge Arts Alliance continues to publish a quarterly newsletter and arts calendar and formerly provided the Guide to Culture and Community, its annual program book.  It was estimated in 2010 that more than 23,000 people benefited from the many performances, workshops, concerts, exhibits and other arts events the River's Edge Arts Alliance helped produce.  The River's Edge Arts Alliance offers sponsorship opportunities for organizations and businesses to promote their groups while showing support for the community and the arts.  Memberships, sponsorships and volunteer support enable the River's Edge Arts Alliance to sustain its mission to "enrich lives and create community through the arts.  They also offer advertising in their event programs.

== Mission ==
The Mission of the River's Edge Arts Alliance is ''"to enrich lives and create community through the arts".''

== Programs ==
The current programs offered are the River's Edge Chorale, River's Edge Community Band, River's Edge Youth Chorus, River's Edge Players, After School Band Lessons for the students of the Hudson Public Schools, Arts After School and Summer Drama Workshop.

'''S4C''' ({{IPA-cy|ɛs ˈpɛdwar ɛk}}, from the Welsh {{lang|cy|Sianel Pedwar Cymru}}, meaning "Channel 4 Wales") is a Welsh-language British public-service TV channel broadcast throughout the [[UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland]]. The first television channel to be aimed specifically at a Welsh-speaking audience, S4C is the fourth-oldest television channel in the [[United Kingdom]], after [[BBC One]], [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[BBC Two]]. As of 2017-2018, S4C had an average of 131 employees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

S4C's headquarters is based in [[Cardiff]], with a regional office located in [[Caernarfon]]. S4C will relocate its headquarters to [[Carmarthen]] in the autumn of 2018, based at the new Yr Egin digital creative hub being developed by [[University of Wales Trinity Saint David]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.s4c.cymru/media/media_assets/s4c-annual-report-and-accounts-spreads.pdf|title=Annual Report and Statement of Accounts|last=|first=|date=|website=S4C|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When first established, the channel—initially broadcast on [[analogue television]]—was bilingual (Welsh and English) outside peak hours, with English-language content consisting of the simultaneous or deferred transmission of programmes from [[Channel 4]] (analogue reception of which was unavailable in most of Wales). When [[digital television]] arrived several years later, S4C added a second, 100% Welsh-language service, called S4C Digidol ("digital"). With the completion of the [[Digital switchover dates in the United Kingdom#Wales|digital switchover in Wales]] on 31 March 2010—which made English-language Channel 4 available across Wales—S4C's bilingual analogue channel closed, and what had been S4C Digidol became the default S4C channel, available on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], satellite and cable, and broadcasting entirely in Welsh. S4C does not commission programming in English, but when English is used on the channel it is left untranslated.

==Pre-history==
Before the launch of S4C on Monday 1 November 1982 (one day before Channel 4 in the rest of the UK), Welsh speakers had been served by occasional programmes in Welsh, broadcast as regional opt-outs on [[BBC Wales]] and [[Harlech Television|HTV Cymru Wales]] (the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchise in Wales), usually at off-peak or inconvenient times. This was unsatisfactory for Welsh speakers, who saw the arrangement as a sop, and at the same time an annoyance for non-Welsh speakers, who found the English language programmes seen in the rest of the UK often rescheduled or not transmitted at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Welshing on TV|date=28 June 1980|work=The Economist|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 the ITV network had created a licence area for North and West Wales, which was awarded to ''Wales (West and North) Limited''. This traded as [[Teledu Cymru]] and provided significant levels of Welsh-language programming. However, problems with transmission infrastructure and poor market research led to financial difficulties within two years and the station was taken over by its neighbour [[Television Wales and West]].

During the 1970s, Welsh-language activists had campaigned for a TV service in the language, which already had its own radio station, [[BBC Radio Cymru]]. Both the Conservative and Labour parties promised a Welsh-language fourth channel, if elected to government in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A channel for Wales|first=Dafydd|last=Hancock|work=EMC Seefour|publisher=Transdiffusion Broadcasting System|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/seefour/wales.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304205140/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/seefour/wales.php|archivedate=4 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the Conservatives won a majority in the election, the new Home Secretary [[William Whitelaw]] decided against a Welsh fourth channel, and suggested that, except for an occasional opt-out, the service should be the same as that offered in the rest of the UK. This led to acts of civil disobedience, including refusals to pay the [[television licence]] fee, thereby running the risk of prosecution or even a prison sentence, and sit-ins in BBC and HTV studios. Some took more extreme measures, including attacking television transmitters in Welsh-speaking areas.

In 1980, the former president of [[History of Plaid Cymru|Plaid Cymru]], [[Gwynfor Evans]], threatened to go on hunger strike if the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] did not honour its commitment to provide a Welsh-language TV service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gwynfor Evans at 90|work=BBC News Online|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2227826.stm|date=1 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel started broadcasting on 1 November 1982, the night before Channel 4's opening. 

==Programming==
[[File:Headquarters of S4C.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of S4C in [[Llanishen]], [[Cardiff]]]]
S4C's remit is to provide a service which features a wide range of programmes in the Welsh language. Like Channel 4, S4C does not produce programmes of its own; instead, it commissions programmes from [[BBC Cymru Wales]] and independent producers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Celtic World|page=800 |chapter=Language and Identity in Modern Wales|last=Green|first=Miranda|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|ISBN=978-0-415-05764-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although the quantity purchased from [[ITV Wales &amp; West|ITV Cymru Wales]] has greatly reduced since the early years of S4C), and it has particularly developed a reputation for commissioning animation, such as ''[[SuperTed]]'', ''[[Rocky Hollow]]'', ''[[Fireman Sam]]'' (also broadcast by the [[BBC]]), ''[[Gogs]]'', ''[[Shakespeare: The Animated Tales]]'' and ''[[Animated Tales of the World]]''.

[[BBC Wales]] fulfils its public service requirement by producing programmes in Welsh, including ''[[Newyddion]]'', S4C's news bulletin, and a soap opera, ''[[Pobol y Cwm]]'', and providing them to S4C free of charge. It has also provided (or licensed) Welsh-language versions of English-language programmes, such as ''[[The Tweenies]]''. On the analogue service, S4C showed programmes produced for Channel 4 in the rest of the United Kingdom – either [[simulcast|simultaneously]] or time-shifted – outside of peak hours. These programmes were provided to S4C by Channel 4, free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Channel 4|first=Peter|last=Catterall|page=51|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|ISBN=978-0-7146-4926-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make content more accessible to English speakers, all Welsh-language programming carries English subtitles. Originally these were on [[Teletext]] page 888, with Welsh subtitles on page 889, with both subtitle languages now also available on digital television platforms. For speakers of English who are learning Welsh, certain programmes, particularly children's programmes ''Planed Plant Bach'' and ''Planed Plant'', carry subtitles featuring Welsh subtitles with additional English translations in brackets next to more difficult Welsh-language words. TV films produced for S4C have received some good foreign reviews; ''[[Hedd Wyn (film)|Hedd Wyn]]'' was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1994 | title = The 66th Academy Awards 1994 | website = oscars.org | publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | location = Los Angeles, CA | access-date = 27 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Solomon &amp; Gaenor]]'' was nominated in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2000 | title = The 72nd Academy Awards 2000 | website = oscars.org | publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | location = Los Angeles, CA  | access-date = 27 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The S4C analogue signal also spilled over on to the east coast of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In the past it was rebroadcast in a number of areas there on [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] terrestrial signals by so-called '[[Television in the Republic of Ireland#Deflectors|deflectors]]'. Up until the 1990s, S4C was also carried by some Irish [[cable television|cable]] and [[MMDS]] providers before being replaced by Channel 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.askcomreg.ie/other/pay_tv.25.LE.asp |title=Ask Comreg - Pay TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The S4C channels continue to be available the Republic of Ireland via the Freesat satellite service.

Up until 2009, S4C ran its own [[teletext]] service, [[Sbectel]] (''"Sbec"'', Welsh for "a peek" or "a glimpse", and a reference to an S4C schedule insert formerly included in the ''[[TV Times]]'' issues for the HTV Wales region).

== Viewing figures ==
9.4&amp;nbsp;million people viewed the channel throughout the UK during 2017-2018, with 690,000 viewers throughout the UK in an average week.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There were also 37 million viewing sessions of S4C content on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in 2017-2018, with 8.2&amp;nbsp;million viewing sessions of S4C content on S4C Arlein and BBC iPlayer. 

On a typical week in 2017, approximately 364,000 viewers in Wales watched the channel on television for at least three consecutive minutes – the highest level of reach since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/media/media-releases/2018/broadcast-tv-viewing-wales|title=Broadcast TV viewing declines in Wales|website=Ofcom|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 166,000 Welsh speakers in Wales watched S4C each week in 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Digital channels==
Following the switch-off of analogue terrestrial signals on 31 March 2010, Wales became the first fully digital region in the UK, with both S4C and Channel 4 becoming available to all homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=S4C Holds a Special Position in the TV Advertising Market|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-222523953.html|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=7 April 2016|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, S4C now broadcasts solely in the Welsh language and, as well as on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] in Wales, is available throughout Britain, Ireland and the rest of western Europe on [[Freesat]] and [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]]. A review commissioned by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] in 2004 suggested that "S4C should operate a single core service after digital switchover".&lt;ref name=Laughton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laughton|first=Roger|title=S4C:An Independent Review|page=32|publisher=Department for Culture, Media and Sport|date=July 2004|accessdate=29 January 2009|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/abouts4c/authority/pdf/e_adolygiad_laughton.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:S4C2logo.svg|right|thumb|Logo of the former channel S4C2]]
In addition, S4C also operated a sister channel, [[S4C2]] until 2010. It formerly broadcast coverage of the [[National Assembly for Wales]] when in session. The programme content was provided by the [[BBC]] who, from January 2010, now make it available online and via [[BBC Parliament]]. Like the main channel, S4C2 was available within Wales on Freeview and throughout the UK and Ireland on Freesat and Sky. S4C2 had two audio feeds, allowing viewers to select between an untranslated version and an English-only version where all Welsh spoken is translated into English. Delayed coverage of Assembly proceedings is now broadcast overnight on S4C's main channel on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursday. In addition to the analogue TV signal transmitted throughout Wales, S4C, along with [[UBM plc|United News &amp; Media]], owned the company [[S4C Digital Networks]] (SDN). SDN was awarded the UK-wide contract to provide half a digital multiplex worth of programming. The other half continues to belong to the broadcaster [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

On 27 April 2005 S4C sold its share of SDN to [[ITV plc]] for approximately £34&amp;nbsp;million, though it still has the half-multiplex as of right in Wales. ITV already owned some of SDN due to the consolidation of the ITV industry: Granada bought UNM's stake in SDN, and this was then incorporated into the united ITV plc. In January 2007, S4C announced plans to launch a Welsh-language children's service.&lt;ref name="S4C announce children's channel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/s4c_unveils_kids_channel_and_rebrand.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419222821/http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/s4c_unveils_kids_channel_and_rebrand.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 April 2013|title=S4C unveils kids' channel and rebrand|accessdate=28 October 2007|date=20 January 2007|publisher=Broadcast Now (subscription required to view article)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new service, in the form of a programming block, launched on 23 June 2008. Under the name [[Cyw]] (chick), it brings together a wide range of programmes for nursery-age children, and S4C plans eventually to extend the service to include the [[Stwnsh]] strand for older children and a third service for teenagers and young people. The service currently airs on weekdays from 7&amp;nbsp;am to 1.30&amp;nbsp;pm on S4C.

S4C launched a high-definition simulcast of S4C called 'Clirlun' on 19 July 2010 to coincide with terrestrial digital switchover in Wales.&lt;ref name="S4C Press Release: S4C Clirlun now available throughout Wales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=351|title=S4C Press Release: S4C Clirlun now available throughout Wales|date=19 July 2010|publisher=S4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clirlun was broadcast on Freeview channel 53 only, and not via other platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/clirlun/e_index.shtml|title=Clirlun|publisher=S4C|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405192725/http://www.s4c.co.uk/clirlun/e_index.shtml|archivedate=5 April 2010|deadurl=yes|accessdate=12 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clirlun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=324|title=S4C launches new High Definition channel - Clirlun|date=29 March 2010|publisher=S4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following funding cuts and a review of core services it was announced on 11 July 2012 that Clirlun would close before the end of the year.&lt;ref name="S4C Press Release: S4C efficiency measures on course to meet targets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=665|title=S4C Press Release: S4C efficiency measures on course to meet targets|date=11 July 2012|publisher=S4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=665|title=S4C efficiency measures on course to meet targets|publisher=S4C authority|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clirlun closed at midnight on the evening of 1 December 2012, with Channel 4 HD taking over its transmission capacity with effect from the next day, 2 December 2012.&lt;ref name="C4HD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/spectrum/spectrum-policy-area/projects/dtv/Amendment_to_Determination.pdf|title=Amendment 1 to the Determination Under Article 3 of the Television Multiplex Services (Reservation of Digital Capacity) Order 2008 Dated 17 October 2008|date=2 October 2012|publisher=Ofcom}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on 20 May 2016 that S4C would relaunch a high-definition service S4C HD on Freesat and Sky in Wales and across the UK from 7 June onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/s4c-bring-back-hd-service-11357722|title=S4C will bring back its HD service just in time for Euro 2016|publisher=S4C|date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 S4C became available on the [[BBC iPlayer]] website, both live and on demand, as part of an 18-month trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/s4c-comes-to-bbc-iplayer-8237804|title=S4C comes to BBC iPlayer|author=Sion Morgan|date=5 December 2014|work=walesonline|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation==

{{Overly detailed|date=January 2017|section=yes}}

===1982–1988===
[[File:S4C 1982 logo.svg|thumb|right|S4C's first logo, used from 1 November 1982 to 30 September 1988]]
On 1 November 1982, S4C's on-air appearance has always been a representation of the Welsh society and people, but this representation has changed several times. Initial idents featured clips from the natural landscapes of Wales with a basic logo animation and fanfare, with the logo forming as ''WALE'''S4C'''YMRU''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa6aQpkyzeY|title=WALES4CYMRU Welcome 1982|date=8 August 2010|work=YouTube|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were several clock idents for the news and closedown.

===1987–1993===
[[File:S4C logo 1988-1995.svg|thumb|left|200px|S4C's second logo, used from 8 September 1987 to 9 February 1995]]
On 8 September 1987, the ident changed to a computer-generated ident featuring an animation of the streamlined S4C logo, the colours of the logo were blue, green and red and the font was Bodoni. There was also a clock ident.

On 7 September 1990, the new ident was introduced, depicting a piece of Welsh slate with colour blue, green and red washing over the letters S4C. There were several versions for this ident. From 1 November 1991 onwards, the music had a sombre violin and a bombastic fanfare. This ident with sombre music was used for S4C Clasuron Fideo in circa. 1992 until 1993. There were two different clock idents, first the grey coloured one until 1992, and the final with in gold colour until 4 September 1993.

===1993–2007===
[[File:S4Clogo 1995-2007.svg|thumb|140px|right|S4C's third logo, used from 10 February 1995 to 17 January 2007]]
On 5 September 1993, S4C introduced a new series of idents, which depicted inanimate objects as having characteristics of dragons (such as flight or breathing fire), as a reference to the red dragon on the [[flag of Wales]]. On 10 February 1995, the channel introduced a new logo, featuring a [[tilde]] representing a dragon.

Inanimate objects in the idents were a kite, a man dressed as a dragon with a staff, flags to become the Welsh dragon, an oxy-acetylene gas pump dragon, a pair of scissors (the tongs variant was also made), the clockwork dragon (schools programming), a sousaphone, a standpipe, an extinguisher (the close up version was also made), a clothes iron, a pencil (the fire version was also made), an electric fan, a pedal bin, a curly light on the pole, a spray can, the countdown screen (sports programming), the tiled carousel (schools programming, the colour version was made until the summer term of 2000, in the autumn term of 2000 onwards, the monochrome version was made), a vacuum cleaner, a mouse (the special preview screen was also made), a stapler with a red ribbon, a garlic crusher, a magic top hat, a lawnmower, a shower, two Sunday Night drama idents, an egg cup (the short version was also made), a loudspeaker and the Chwareon/Sports ident.

Special idents were the Christmas idents, St. David's Day idents, a Kangaroo dragon flag ident for the Rugby World Cup 2003, Mawr (ITV Ident in 2004), Cofio 60, Eisteddfod idents and Big Brother 7 final.

The clockwork dragon ident was discontinued by June 1999. 

The variants (such as the shots, angles and music) for the idents were the entertainment dragon, the dragon man, the scissors, the sousaphone, the extinguisher, the pencil, the fan, the tiled carousel and the egg cup idents.

The entertainment dragon, the gas pump dragon and the spray can idents were discontinued by 2000.

The new sports ident named Chwareon S4C Sport replaced the countdown screen in October 2004.

The entertainment/flags ident was used for S4C Clasuron Fideo in 1993 - 1997.

The dragon idents were withdrawn on 31 December 2006.

The clock idents changed in 1993, 1995 (the same clock from 1993, with the new logo), 1999, 2000, 2002, 2005 and 2006. There were also Christmas versions for the clock idents.

From 1 January 2007 to 16 January, temporary idents were used which gave a nod towards what was to come for the new presentation on the station. It was called 'A new direction'.

The 1995 S4C logo was withdrawn on 17 January 2007. 

This was the last S4C logo to include the clock ident.

===2007–2014===
[[File:S4C logo.svg|thumb|S4C's fourth logo, used from 18 January 2007 to 9 April 2014]]
On 18 January 2007, S4C announced that their digital channels would be refreshed with a new corporate logo and brand. The new branding was implemented online on 17 January, with S4C's television channels adopting it the next day. The new branding, developed by the London-based firm Proud Creative, was intended to portray S4C as a more "contemporary" multi-platform broadcaster, and downplayed "traditional" Welsh imagery such as dragons. Its idents were filmed around various parts of the country, and themed around magnetism—representing the "uncontrollable attraction" of Welsh people and their "emotional affinity to the homeland, whether near or far."&lt;ref name=guardian-s4crevamp&gt;{{cite web|title=Branding revamp for S4C|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/18/marketingandpr.broadcasting|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S4C announce rebrand"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.ca/media/news/a41509/s4c-gets-a-rebrand.html|title=S4C gets a rebrand|accessdate=11 January 2007|last=Oatts|first=Joanne|date=9 January 2007|publisher=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetism-themed idents were later replaced by a new set developed in collaboration with the agency Minivegas, consisting of live-action scenes with dynamic, animated elements that can react to the voice of the continuity announcer.&lt;ref name=mv-idents&gt;{{cite web|title=S4C Interactive Idents|url=http://minivegas.net/projects/s4c/|work=Minivegas|accessdate=10 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413125221/http://minivegas.net/projects/s4c/|archivedate=13 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014–present===
A new S4C logo and brand developed by Sugar Creative Studio was introduced on 10 April 2014; the new design was developed around a concept of providing "context" to S4C's target audience and programming. The design revolves heavily around a trapezoidal shape used within the channel's new logo, which is prominently used within aspects of the channel's overall marketing and branding.&lt;ref name=sugar-news4c&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing a new identity for S4C designed by Sugar Creative Studio|url=http://s4c.sugarcs.com/|publisher=Sugar Creative Studio|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
S4C has faced criticism for poor viewing figures since its launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plaid protester's S4C lament|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2384025.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=1 November 2002|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaked internal reports in March 2010 showed that "over the 20-day period from February 15 to last Saturday, March 6, as many as 196 of the 890 programmes put out by S4C were rated as having "zero viewers". The story was widely reported across the UK and referenced in parliament by the then [[Culture Secretary]] [[Jeremy Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shipton |first=Martin |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2010/03/10/figures-reveal-failure-of-s4c-to-attract-tv-audiences-91466-25999157/ |title=Figures reveal failure of S4C to attract TV audiences |publisher=WalesOnline |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The £100m taxpayer-funded Welsh TV channel where one in four shows get ZERO viewers|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1257157/The-100m-Welsh-TV-channel-shows-ZERO-viewers.html|website=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, an S4C spokesperson stated that 90% of those programmes were aimed at pre-school children, and that BARB (the organisation that compiles television ratings in the UK) only takes into account viewers aged four years and over. The remaining 10% consisted of repeats and daytime news bulletins which did not attract the minimum 1,000 viewers necessary to register on a UK-wide analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/columnists/2010/11/04/these-are-the-facts-about-s4c-but-why-let-them-spoil-a-good-headline-91466-27600820|title=These are the facts about S4C, but why let them spoil a good headline?|date=4 November 2010|last=Evans|first=Carys|work=WalesOnline.co.uk|publisher=Media Wales Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July 2010, S4C's chief executive Iona Jones left her post without explanation. Assembly members and Members of Parliament requested an independent investigation into the circumstances leading up to her departure. The S4C Authority refused to comment further and commissioned a review into how the broadcaster was governed in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=364 Sir Jon Shortridge appointed to undertake S4C corporate governance review], S4C press release, 19 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 2011, it was announced that issues between Iona Jones and S4C had been settled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=464 Iona Jones - No Tribunal] S4C official press release, 3 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 February 2011, the Shortridge Report on corporate governance was made public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s4c.co.uk/abouts4c/authority/pdf/adolygiad_o_lywodraethiant_corfforaethol-s4c.pdf Review of the Corporate Governance of S4C] on official website, 11 February 2011. (The English version begins at page 54.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
S4C appointed its first female CEO, [[Iona Jones]] in 2005.

Owen Evans, previously the deputy permanent secretary to the [[Welsh Government]], became chief executive in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-39928086|title=Owen Evans appointed as new S4C chief executive|date=2017-05-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.s4c.cymru/en/about-us/page/17266/s4c-strategic-board/|title=About us {{!}} S4C|website=www.s4c.cymru|language=en|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding and regulation==
From its inception S4C was part publicly-financed: funding came both from its advertising revenue and a fixed annual grant from the UK [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS), receiving £90m of funding in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S4C Annual Report 2011|work=www.s4c.co.uk|publisher=S4C|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/abouts4c/annualreport/acrobats/s4c-annual-report-2011.pdf|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some Welsh-language programming (including ''[[Newyddion]]'' and ''[[Pobol y Cwm]]'') was produced by [[BBC Wales]] as part of the [[BBC]]'s [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public service]] remit, and provided to S4C free of charge. There is an agreement in place until 2022 for 10 hours a week of programming to be provided to S4C, which is valued at £19.4m annually.

From 2013, responsibility for funding S4C began to transfer to the BBC, with the DCMS reducing its funding by 94% by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11696905|work=BBC News|title=S4C brings £90m to Welsh economy, finds new research|date=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC will provide around £76m of funding to S4C by this date, resulting in a cut of around 25% to S4C's annual budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11581346|work=BBC News|title=S4C seeks judicial review over BBC funding move|date=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it was agreed that the BBC would provide £74.5m a year funding to S4C from the licence fee until 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-37300406|title=S4C £74.5m funding confirmed until 2022|date=7 September 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Government announced in 2018 that it would continue providing £6.72m until 2020, with the aim of S4C being funded wholly from the licence fee from 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-future-of-s4c|title=The future of S4C|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would see S4C's funding being decided as part of the licence fee settlement, for 10 year periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-43569372|title=S4C set to lose its government funding|first=David|last=Cornock|date=29 March 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to public funding, S4C generates around 2% of its income through commercial sources, such as [[Television advertisement|advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.cymru/en/about-us/introducing-s4c/page/17280/introducing-s4c/|title=Introducing S4C - S4C|website=www.s4c.cymru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S4C is controlled by the [[S4C Authority]] (''Awdurdod S4C''), an independent body unconnected to [[Ofcom]], the regulator of other UK television channels such as ITV and Channel 4.

==Catch-up==
[[File:S4C Catch Up.png|200px|right|Clic]]
S4C maintains its own catch-up service called '''Clic'''. Clic is a free online [[video on demand]] service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/clic/e_faqs.shtml|title=Questions about Clic|publisher=S4C|accessdate=26 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905045739/http://www.s4c.co.uk/clic/e_faqs.shtml|archivedate=5 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers live-streaming, [[Sign language|signed]] programming, a 35-day catch-up service, and archive programming. Clic is available across the U.K. but also contains a limited selection of worldwide programming. Clic's catch-up service is split into seven categories: Drama, Entertainment, Factual and Arts, Music, Sport, and two Children's categories,  [[Cyw]] (ages 3–6) and [[Stwnsh]] (ages 7–13). A Clic app was released for [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] devices on 18 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/e_press_level2.shtml?id=550|title=S4C Clic app now available for the iPad|publisher=S4C|date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2014 S4C's programmes and live-streaming also became available to view on the BBC's catch-up service, BBC iPlayer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/s4c-comes-to-bbc-iplayer-8237804|title=S4C comes to BBC iPlayer|first=Sion|last=Morgan|date=5 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Both services offer English and Welsh subtitles to some shows. 

There were 8.2 million viewing sessions to S4C content on Clic and BBC iPlayer in 2017-2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was an increase of 600,000 from the 7.6 million viewing sessions on those platforms in 2016-2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-40644393|title=S4C 'reaching new audiences'|last=Thomas|first=Huw|date=2017-07-18|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sandviksfjorden''''' ([[English language|English translation]]: '''''The Fjord at Sandviken'''''&lt;ref name="HFG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MIA" /&gt;) is a painting by [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Norwegian romantic nationalism|romanticist]] painter [[Hans Gude]] completed in [[1879 in art|1879]].&lt;ref name="MIA" /&gt;

==Scene and style==
Gude painted scenes of the Christiania Fjord numerous times starting in 1870, and ''Sandviksfjorden'' can be seen as a representative piece of this group of works.&lt;ref name="HFG" /&gt; Gude painted the piece in 1879 based on studies he had done in [[Snarøen]] during his visit there in the summer of 1873.&lt;ref name="MIA" /&gt; Gude made detailed sketches of ships, and was even provided detailed models of ships by his brother, which he used to realistically render the ships in ''Sandviksfjorden'' down to the rigging and fishing tackle.&lt;ref name="HFG" /&gt;

==Reception==
Gude lists ''Sandviksfjorden'' as one of his major works, and it was purchased the same year it was painted by the [[Nationalmuseum]] in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="MIA" /&gt;

However the work was not universally acclaimed, and Gude's former student [[Christian Krohg]] criticized the piece, pointing out how Gude unrealistically exaggerated the effect of sunlight by using areas of dark, mainly the boats, trees, and [[Promontory|promitories]] to act as an unnaturally contrast to the light on the water.&lt;ref name="HFG" /&gt; Krohg also notes that while the light falls correctly on the water, Gude has dimmed the surrounding landscape to further the contrast.&lt;ref name="HFG" /&gt;

'''Scherenschnitte''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃeːʁənˌʃnɪtə}}), which means "scissor cuts" in [[German language|German]], is the art of [[paper cutting]] design. The artwork often has rotational symmetry within the design, and common forms include silhouettes, valentines, and love letters. The art tradition was founded in [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]] in the 16th century and was brought to [[Colonial America]] in the 18th century by Swiss and German immigrants who settled primarily in [[Pennsylvania]].

[[File:Sensation Young British Artists from the Saatchi Collection at the Brooklyn Museum 15.jpg|thumb|267x267px|''Sensation'' installed at [[Brooklyn Museum]] (October 1999  – January 2000)]]
'''''Sensation''''' was an exhibition of the collection of contemporary art owned by [[Charles Saatchi]], including many works by [[Young British Artists]], (YBAs), which first took place 18 September – 28 December 1997 at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London and later toured to the [[Hamburger Bahnhof]] in Berlin and the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in New York City. A proposed showing at the [[National Gallery of Australia]] was cancelled when the gallery's director decided the exhibition was "too close to the market."

The show generated controversy in London and New York City due to the inclusion of images of [[Myra Hindley]] and the [[Virgin Mary]]. It was criticised by New York City mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] and others for attempting to boost the value of the work by showing it in institutions and public museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/093099brooklyn-museum.html |title=Brooklyn Museum Accused of Trying to Lift Art Value |first=David M. |last=Herszenhorn |date=30 September 1999 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

The artworks in ''Sensation'' were from the collection of [[Charles Saatchi]], a leading collector, advertising mogul and publiciser of contemporary art. [[Norman Rosenthal]], the Royal Academy of Arts exhibitions secretary, helped to stage the 110 works by 42 different artists.  Many of the pieces had already become famous, or notorious, with the British public (for example, [[Damien Hirst]]'s [[shark]] suspended in [[formaldehyde]] titled ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', [[Tracey Emin]]'s tent titled ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995]]''), [[Marc Quinn]]'s self-portrait (a frozen head made from pints of his own blood) and [[Sarah Lucas]]'s explicitly sexual images and sculptures. Others had already achieved prominence in other ways, such as a successful advertising campaign using an idea from [[Gillian Wearing]]'s photographs. ''Sensation'' was the first time that a wide audience had had the chance to see these works en masse. The Royal Academy posted this disclaimer to visitors on entry:
{{quote|There will be works of art on display in the Sensation exhibition which some people may find distasteful. Parents should exercise their judgment in bringing their children to the exhibition. One gallery will not be open to those under the age of 18.''&lt;ref name="Dalry"/&gt;}}

==London==
[[File:Burlington House-Courtyard.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Academy of Arts]], London|306x306px]]The opening of ''Sensation'' at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] caused a public furore and a media frenzy, with both [[broadsheet]] and [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] journalists falling over themselves to comment on the show's controversial images, and unprecedented crowds queuing up to see for themselves what all the fuss was about.  Around a quarter of the RA's 80 academicians gave a warning that the exhibition was inflammatory.  They and some members of the public complained about several other exhibits, notably the installations by [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], which were of child mannequins with noses replaced by penises and mouths in the form of an anus.

However, the biggest media controversy was over ''[[Myra (painting)|Myra]]'', an image of the murderer [[Moors murders|Myra Hindley]] by [[Marcus Harvey]].&lt;ref name="Dalry"&gt;{{citation |last=Dalrymple |first=Theodore |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/8_1_urbanities-trash.html |title=Trash, Violence, and Versace: But Is It Art? |magazine=City Journal |date=Winter 1998 |accessdate=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mothers Against Murder and Aggression protest group picketed the show, accompanied by Winnie Johnson, the mother of one of Hindley's victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Alberge |first=Dalya |title=Attacks force Hindley portrait to be moved |newspaper=The Times |date=19 September 1997 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F924CA724CFF0B6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=1054640702C8DBC0 |subscription=yes |accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They asked for the portrait, which is made up of hundreds of copies of a child's handprint, to be excluded to protect Johnson's feelings. Along with supporters she picketed the show's first day. Myra Hindley sent a letter from jail suggesting that her portrait be removed from the exhibition, reasoning that such action was necessary because the work was "a sole disregard not only for the emotional pain and trauma that would inevitably be experienced by the families of the Moors victims but also the families of any child victim."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lyall |first=Sarah |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEEDD1F38F933A1575AC0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Art That Tweaks British Propriety] |newspaper=New York Times |date=20 September 1997 |accessdate=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, Alison. "Judging the Image: Art, Value, Law". Routledge, January, 2005. p. 34. {{ISBN|0-415-30183-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all the protest the painting remained hanging.  Windows at Burlington House, the Academy's home, were smashed and two demonstrators hurled ink and eggs at the picture as a result, requiring it to be removed and restored. It was put back on display behind [[Perspex]]&lt;ref name=storm&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/455902.stm "Sensation sparks New York storm"], [[BBC]], 23 September 1999. Retrieved 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and guarded by security men.

In a press conference on 16 September 1997, David Gordon, Secretary of the Royal Academy commented on the controversial portrait: "The majority view inside the Academy was that millions and millions of images of Myra Hindley have been reproduced in newspapers and magazines. Books have been written about the murders. Television programmes have been made. Hindley’s image is in the public domain; part of our consciousness; an awful part of our recent social history; a legitimate subject for journalism – and for art."

The show was extremely popular with the general public, attracting over 300,000 visitors during its run,&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; helped by the media attention which the strong subject matter had received.  The BBC described it as "gory images of dismembered limbs and explicit pornography".&lt;ref name=limbs&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/43401.stm "Entertainment Sensational hit for Royal Academy"], [[BBC]], 30 December 1997. Retrieved 22 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berlin==
''Sensation'' was shown at the Berlin's [[Hamburger Bahnhof]] museum (30 September 1998 – 30 January 1999) and proved so popular that it was extended past its original closing date of 28 December 1998. For art critic Nicola Kuhn from ''Der Tagesspiegel'', there was "no sensation about Sensation". She claimed that the Berlin audience found the yBa's work "more sad and serious than irreverent, funny and dazzling"&lt;ref name="Hatton"&gt;Hatton, Rita and Walker, John.

''artdesigncafe''.  Retrieved 20 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York City==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum June 2008 sunset jeh.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
The exhibition was shown in New York City at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] from 2 October 1999 to 9 January 2000. The New York City show was met with instant protest, centring on ''[[The Holy Virgin Mary]]'' by [[Chris Ofili]], which had not provoked this reaction in London. While the press reported that the piece was "smeared", "splattered" or "stained" with elephant dung,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-pPe2HVNb08C&amp;pg=PA38 Judging the image: art, value, law], Alison Young, Routledge, 2005, {{ISBN|0-415-30184-X}}, p.38-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedlander&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ym1ADWLrWmwC&amp;pg=PA88 Feminine look: sexuation, spectatorship, subversion], Jennifer Friedlander, SUNY Press, 2008 {{ISBN|0-7914-7295-7}}, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Ofili's work in fact showed a carefully rendered black Madonna decorated with a resin-covered lump of elephant dung. The figure is also surrounded by small collaged images of female genitalia from pornographic magazines; these seemed from a distance to be the traditional [[cherubim]].

New York City Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]], who had seen the work in the catalogue but not in the show, called it "sick stuff" and threatened to withdraw the annual $7&amp;nbsp;million City Hall grant from the [[Brooklyn Museum]] hosting the show, because "You don't have a right to government subsidy for desecrating somebody else's religion."&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; [[Cardinal John O'Connor]], the [[Archbishop of New York]], said, "one must ask if it is an attack on religion itself," and the president of America's biggest group of Orthodox Jews, Mandell Ganchrow, called it "deeply offensive".&lt;ref name=whiff&gt;{{citation |last1=Davies |first1=Hugh |last2=Fenton |first2=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/10/02/wsen02.html |title=Whiff of sensation hits New York |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2 October 1999 |accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William A. Donohue]], President of the [[Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights]], said the work "induces revulsion".&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; Giuliani started a lawsuit to evict the museum, and Arnold Lehman, the museum director, filed a federal lawsuit against Giuliani for a breach of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt;

[[Hillary Clinton]] spoke up for the museum, as did the New York Civil Liberties Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/092899brooklyn-hillary.html |title=First Lady Assails Mayor Over Threat to Museum |first=Adam |last=Nagourney |publisher=New York Times |date=28 September 1999 |accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial board of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, Giuliani's stance "promises to begin a new Ice Age in New York's cultural affairs."&lt;ref name=nat&gt;Rapp, Christopher. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_20_51/ai_56220691 "Dung Deal – Brooklyn Museum of Art's "Sensation" exhibition"], ''[[National Review]]'', 25 October 1999. Retrieved 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper also carried a full-page advertisement in support signed by over 100 actors, writers and artists, including [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]] and [[Susan Sontag]].&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt; Ofili, who is Roman Catholic, said, "elephant dung in itself is quite a beautiful object."&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt;

The [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a nonbinding resolution to end federal funding for the museum on 3 October 1999, and New York City did stop funding to the Brooklyn Museum.  On 1 November, federal judge [[Nina Gershon]] ordered the City not only to restore the funding that was denied to the Museum, but also to refrain from continuing its ejectment action.  On 16 December 1999, a 72-year-old man was arrested for criminal mischief after smearing the Ofili painting with white paint, which was soon removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_2_88/ai_59450150/ |magazine=Art in America |title=Vandal Attacks Ofili Madonna |date=February 2000 |accessdate=20 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120055422/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_2_88/ai_59450150/ |archive-date=20 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The museum produced a yellow stamp, saying the artworks on show "may cause shock, vomiting, confusion, panic, euphoria and anxiety."&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt; and Ofili's painting was shown behind a Plexiglass screen, guarded by a museum attendant and an armed police officer.&lt;ref name=nat/&gt; Jeffrey Hogrefe, art critic for the ''[[New York Observer]]'', commented about the museum, "They wanted to get some publicity and they got it. I think it was pretty calculated."&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; The editor-in-chief of the New York City ''[[Art &amp; Auction]]'' magazine, Bruce Wolmer,said: "When the row eventually fades the only smile will be on the face of Charles Saatchi, a master self-promoter."&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt;

==Australia==
The show was scheduled to open in June 1999 at the [[National Gallery of Australia]], but was cancelled with the director, Brian Kennedy, saying that, although it was due to be funded by the Australian government, it was "too close to the market" since finance for the Brooklyn exhibition included $160,000 from Saatchi, who owned the work; $50,000 from [[Christie's]], who had sold work for Saatchi; and $10,000 from dealers of many of the artists.&lt;ref name=vogeloz&gt;Vogel, Carol. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E5DA1E3FF932A35751C1A96F958260 "Australian Museum cancels controversial art show"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 December 1999.

'''Shakir Hassan Al Said''' ({{lang-ar|شاكر حسن ال سعيد}}) (1925–2004), an Iraqi [[painting|painter]], [[sculpture|sculptor]] and writer, is considered one of Iraq's most innovative&lt;ref name="Mikdadi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mikdadi|first=Salwa|title=West Asia: Between Tradition and Modernity|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/trmd/hd_trmd.htm|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influential&lt;ref name="Shabout"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shabout|first=Nada|title=Shakir Hassan Al Said: A Journey towards the One-dimension|publisher=Nafas|date=May 2008|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2008/shakir_hassan_al_said|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; artists. An artist, philosopher, art critic and art historian, he was actively involved in the formation of two important art groups that influenced the direction of post-colonial art in Iraq. He, and the art groups in which he was involved, shaped the modern Iraqi art movement and bridged the gap between modernity and heritage. His theories charted a new Arabic art aesthetic which allowed for valuations of regional art through lenses that were uniquely Arabic rather than Western.

== Biography ==
Al Said was born in [[Samawa]], Iraq; a rural area.&lt;ref name="Khatibi2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Khatibi|first=Abdelkebir |authorlink=Abdelkebir Khatibi|title=L'art contemporain arabe: prolégomènes|page=23|language=French|year=2001|publisher=Al Manar|isbn=978-2-913896-11-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He spent most of his adult life living and working in Bagdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaker Hassan Al Said|publisher=Kinda Foundation|url=http://www.kinda.org/shakerhassan.htm|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His rural upbringing was an important source of inspiration for his art and his philosophies. He wrote about his daily trek to school in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;Al-Said cited in: Yusif, F., "Shakir Hasan al-Said: Journey through style," ''Gilgamesh,'' Vol. 4, 1987, pp 7 -11&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|"On my way from school, I used to see scores of faces, brown faces, painful and toiling faces.  How close they were to my heart! They pressed me and I passed them again and again.  They suffered and I felt their suffering.  The peasants with their loose belts were pricked by thorns.  They were so close to my heart!"}}

In 1948, he received a degree in social science from the Higher Institute of Teachers in Baghdad and in 1954, a diploma in painting from the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad where he was taught by [[Jawad Saleem]].&lt;ref name="BahraniShabout2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bahrani|first1=Zainab |last2=Shabout|first2=Nada M. |title=Modernism and Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3fZIAQAAIAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery, Columbia University in the City of New York|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his studies at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris until 1959,&lt;ref name="Darat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaker Hassan Al Said|publisher=Darat al Funum|url=http://www.daratalfunun.org/main/activit/curentl/anniv/exhib3.html|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was taught by [[:fr:Raymond Legueult|Raymond Legueult]].&lt;ref name="BloomBlair2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Jonathan |last2=Blair|first2=Sheila |title=The Grove encyclopedia of Islamic art and architecture|page=165|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in Paris, he discovered Western modern art in galleries and [[Sumer]]ian art at the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]].&lt;ref name="Shabout"/&gt; After his return to Baghdad in 1959, Al Said studied the work of [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti]],&lt;ref name="Mikdadi"/&gt; [[sufism]]&lt;ref name="Shabout"/&gt; and [[Mansur Al-Hallaj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson-Goldie|first=Kaelen|title=Paying tribute to an Iraqi master before his legacy disappears|newspaper=Daily Star|date=March 21, 2005|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/ArticlePrint.aspx?id=95326&amp;mode=print|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gradually abandoned figurative expressions and centered his compositions on [[Arabic calligraphy]].&lt;ref name="Mikdadi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shabout"/&gt;

With [[Jawad Saleem]], he co-founded  ''Jama'et Baghdad lil Fann al-Hadith'' ([[Iraqi art#Jama’et Baghdad lil Fenal-Hadith (The Baghdad Modern Art Group)|The Baghdad Modern Art Group]]) in 1951; one of the most unusual arts movements in the Middle East in the post–World War II,&lt;ref name="GhareebDougherty2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghareeb|first1=Edmund |last2=Dougherty|first2=Beth |title=Historical dictionary of Iraq|year=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-4330-1|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aimed to achieve an artistic approach both modern and embracing of tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Secor|first=Beth|title='Iraqi Artists in Exile' Showcase Their Haunting Works|newspaper=Houston Press|date=January 13, 2009|url=http://www.ufppc.org/us-a-world-news-mainmenu-35/8533-art-review-iraqi-artists-in-exile-in-houston-november-2008-february-2009.html|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specific approach was called ''Istilham al-turath'' (Seeking inspiration from tradition), considered as "the basic point of departure, to achieve through modern styles, a cultural vision".&lt;ref name="Shabout"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" DakhliaDepaule2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Dakhlia|first1=Jocelyne|last2=Depaule|first2=Jean-Charles |title=Créations artistiques contemporaines en pays d'islam: des arts en tensions |page=286|year=2006|publisher=Kimé|isbn=978-2-84174-402-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These artists were inspired by the 13th-century [[Baghdad School]] and the work of calligraphers and illustrators such as [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|Yahya Al-Wasiti]] who was active in Baghdad in the 1230s. They believed that the Mongol invasion of 1258 represented a "break in the chain of pictorial Iraqi art" &lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx Online]&lt;/ref&gt;  and wanted to recover lost traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F. (ed.), ''Strokes of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London:, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 25; Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Saleem in 1961, al-Said headed the group.&lt;ref name="Shabout2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shabout|first=Nada M. |title=Dafatir|year=2007|publisher=University of North Texas School of Visual Arts|isbn=978-1-889886-08-4|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Said wrote the manifesto for the Baghdad Modern Art Group and read it at the group's first exhibition in 1951. It was the first art manifesto to be published in Iraq. Scholars often consider this event to the birth of the Iraqi modern art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S., "Shakir Hassan Al Said," [Biography] in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Shakir-Hassan-Al-Said.aspx Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Said also wrote the manifesto for an art group he founded in 1971. After suffering from a spiritual crisis, the artist broke away from the Baghdad Modern Art group and formed the ''Al Bu'd al Wahad'' (or the [[One Dimension Group]])",&lt;ref name="Darat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lack, J. 2017"&gt;Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos, Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M52&lt;/ref&gt; which was deeply infused with Al Said's theories about the place of art in nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S., "Shakir Hassan Al Said," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Shakir-Hassan-Al-Said.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of the One Dimension Group were multi-dimensional and complex. At the most basic level, the group rejected two and three-two dimensional artwork in favour of a single "inner dimension". In practice, a single inner dimension was difficult to manifest because most artworks are produced on two-dimensional surfaces.&lt;ref name="Lack, J. 2017"/&gt; At a more profound level, "one dimension" refers to "eternity". Al Said explained:&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|"From a philosophical point of view, the One-Dimension is eternity, or an extension of the past to the time before the existence of pictorial surface; to the non-surface. Our consciousness of the world is a relative presence. It is our self-existence while our absence is our eternal presence." }}

Al Said actively searched for relationships between time and space; and for a visual language that would connect Iraq's deep art traditions with modern art methods and materials. The incorporation of callij (calligraphy) letters into modern artworks was an important aspect of this. The letter became part of Al Said's transition from figurative art to abstract art.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic calligraphy was charged with intellectual and esoteric Sufi meaning,&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, pp 1294-95&lt;/ref&gt;  in that it was an explicit reference to a Medieval theology where letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Mir-Kasimov, O., ''Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam,'' I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

This group was part of a broader Islamic art movement that emerged independently across North Africa and parts of Asia in the 1950s and known as the ''[[Jordanian art#Hurufiyah Art Movement|hurufiyah art movement]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; Hurufiyah refers to the attempt by artists to combine traditional art forms, notably calligraphy as a graphic element within a contemporary artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; Hurufiyah artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead searched for a new visual languages that reflected their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully transformed calligraphy into a modern aesthetic, which was both contemporary and indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Said, used his writing, lectures and his involvement in various art groups to shape the direction of the modern Iraqi art movement and bridged the gap between modernity and heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq: The Ancient Sites and Iraqi Kurdistan,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2015, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, Al Said "charted a new Arabo-Islamic art aesthetic, and thus initiated a possible alternative for art valuating for local and regional art other than those allowed through an exclusionary Western canon of art history." &lt;ref name="Shabout"/&gt;

==Work==

Al Said's early work reveals the influence of European avant-garde art movements - particularly expressionism and cubism. However, his work also drew on his Arabic-Islamic heritage and popular culture. His work evolved from the 1960s, after his began to focus on Sufism in the 1960s. From this time, he began to integrate Arabic letters as a visual element in his compositions. Calligraphy is of vital importance in the Arabic art because letters were charged with Sufi intellectual and esoteric meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, pp 1294-95; Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Mir-Kasimov, O., ''Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam,'' I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015; Schimmel,  A., ''Calligraphy and Islamic Culture,'' London, I.B. Taurus, 1990, pp 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; However, traditional  calligraphic work was bound by strict rules, which amongst other things, confined calligraphy to devotional works.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel,  A., ''Calligraphy and Islamic Culture,'' London, I.B. Taurus, 1990, pp 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;  Al Said and his followers were responsible for setting calligraphy free from its traditional confines, and using it in modern abstract artworks.&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Said published several books on modern art in Iraq and numerous articles in Arabic journals and newspapers. He is recognized as one of the fathers of modern art in Iraq. His influence as an artist, a teacher, and a forerunner of modern art.

"'''The Book'''" is an unfinished short story by American [[horror fiction]] writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]], believed to have been written in late 1933. It was first published in the journal ''Leaves'' in 1938, after Lovecraft's death. 

In the story fragment, the narrator is given an ancient book by a strange bookseller, and when he takes it home and examines it, weird and sinister events ensue.

In October 1933, Lovecraft wrote in a letter:

{{quote|I am at a sort of standstill in writing—disgusted at much of my older work, and uncertain as to avenues of improvement. In recent weeks I have done a tremendous amount of experimenting with different styles and perspectives, but have destroyed most of the results.&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, ''Selected Letters'' Vol. 4, p. 289; cited in [[S. T. Joshi]] and David E. Schultz, "Book, The", ''An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia'' suggests that "The Book" was one of the undestroyed experiments—an attempt to translate Lovecraft's poem sequence ''[[Fungi from Yuggoth]]'' into prose. (The completed fragment corresponds to the first three [[sonnets]], which form more of a coherent narrative than the rest of the sequence.)&lt;ref&gt;Joshi and Schultz, "Book, The",  p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Black Tome of Alsophocus", first published in ''[[Cthulhu Mythos anthology#New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos|New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos]]'' (1969), is an attempt by Martin S. Warnes to complete "The Book".&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey Campbell, "Introduction", ''New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos''.&lt;/ref&gt; Warnes turns the fragment into a tale of possession by [[Nyarlathotep]].&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft and Martin S. Warnes, "The Black Tome of Alsophocus", ''New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Burial of the Count of Orgaz''''' (Spanish: El Entierro del Conde de Orgaz) is a 1586 painting by [[El Greco]], a prominent [[Renaissance]] [[painting|painter]], [[sculpture|sculptor]], and [[architecture|architect]] of [[Greeks|Greek]] origin. Widely considered among his finest works, it illustrates a popular local legend of his time. An exceptionally large painting, it is divided into two sections, heavenly above and terrestrial below, but it gives little impression of duality, since the upper and lower sections are brought together compositionally.

The painting has been lauded by art scholars, characterized, ''inter alia'', as "one of the most truthful pages in the history of Spain", as a masterpiece of [[Art of Europe|Western Art]] and of late [[Mannerism]], and as the epitome of Greco's artistic style.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 81&lt;br /&gt;* F. Philipp, "El Greco's Entombment", 88–89&lt;br /&gt;* S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme==
The theme of the painting is inspired from a legend of the beginning of the 14th century. In 1312, a certain Don Gonzalo Ruiz, native of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], and Señor of the town of [[Orgaz]], died (his family later received the title of Count, by which he is generally and posthumously known). Don Gonzalo Ruiz was a descendant of the noble [[Palaiologos]] family, which produced the last ruling dynasty of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. A pious [[Gentleman|Caballero]], the Count of Orgaz was also a [[philanthropist]], who, among other charitable acts, left a sum of money for the enlargement and adornment of the [[Iglesia de Santo Tomé, Toledo|church of Santo Tomé]] (El Greco's parish church), where he wanted to be buried.&lt;ref name="Plaka74"&gt;D.F. González, ''Gonzalo Ruiz de Toledo'', 213&lt;br /&gt;* M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 74&lt;br /&gt;* S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 1–4, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the legend, at the time the Count was buried, [[Saint Stephen]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] descended in person from the heavens and buried him by their own hands in front of the dazzled eyes of those present. The event is depicted in the painting, with every detail of the work's subject described in the contract signed between Greco and the Church. The miracle is also mentioned in the Latin epitaphian inscription, set into the wall below the painting.&lt;ref name="Plaka54-55"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco-The Greek'', 54–55&lt;br /&gt;* S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 1&lt;/ref&gt; Although Greco abided by the terms of the contract, he introduced some elements which "modernized" the legend, such as a series of features attributed to a 16th century customary funeral procession, the vestments of the two saints, as well as the depiction of eminent Toledan figures of his time. The "modernization" of the legend serves the didactic purpose of the painting, which, in accord with the [[Counter-Reformation]] doctrines, stresses the importance of both the worship of saints and of good deeds for the salvation of the soul.&lt;ref name="Schroth1"&gt;S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 1, 6–7&lt;br /&gt;* D. Davies, "El Greco &amp; the Reform Movements in Spain", 69&lt;br /&gt;* M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:El Greco - The Burial of the Count of Orgazdetal1.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Detail of the painting]]
[[File:El Greco - The Burial of the Count of Orgaz (detail) - WGA10493.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Detail of the painting, showing El Greco]]
The painting was commissioned by Andrés Núñez, the [[parish priest]] of Santo Tomé, for the side-chapel of the Virgin of the church of Santo Tomé.&lt;ref&gt;R.-M. Hagen–R. Hagen, ''What Great Paintings Say'', II, 198&lt;br /&gt;* M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco-The Greek'', 54&lt;br /&gt;* M. Tazartes, ''El Greco'', 122&lt;/ref&gt; Núñez, who had initiated a project to refurbish the Count's burial chapel, is portrayed in the painting reading (on the right of the lower part of the composition).&lt;ref&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 77&lt;br /&gt;* [[Web Gallery of Art]], [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/greco_el/09/index.html The Burial of the Count of Orgaz]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting's commission was the last step in the priest's plan to glorify the parish.&lt;ref name="Schroth6"&gt;S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Signed on 18 March 1586, the contract between Núñez and El Greco laid down specific iconographic demands, stipulated that the artist would pay for the materials, and provided for the delivery of the work until Christmas 1587. Greco must have worked at a frantic pace, and finished the painting between late 1587 and the spring of 1588. A long debate between the priests and the painter followed in relation to the value of the latter's work, for which the contract stipulated that it would be determined by appraisal.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Kagan, "El Greco and the Law", 85–86&lt;br /&gt;* M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 75&lt;/ref&gt; Initially intransigent, Greco eventually compromised and settled for the lower first "expert estimate", agreeing to receive 13,200 [[Spanish real|reales]].&lt;ref name="Plaka75"&gt;R.L. Kagan, "El Greco and the Law", 85–86&lt;br /&gt;* M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 75&lt;br /&gt;* F. Philipp, "El Greco's Entombment", 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in 1588, people were flocking to Orgaz to see the painting. This immediate popular reception was mainly due to the realistic portrayal of the notable men of Toledo of the time.&lt;ref name="Plaka54"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco-The Greek'', 54&lt;/ref&gt; It was the custom for the eminent and noble men of the town to assist the burial of the noble-born, and it was stipulated in the contract that the scene should be represented in this manner.&lt;ref name="Web2"&gt;[[Web Gallery of Art]], [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/greco_el/09/index.html The Burial of the Count of Orgaz]&lt;/ref&gt;

El Greco would pay homage to the aristocracy of the spirit, the clergy, the jurists, the poets and the scholars, who honored him and his art with their esteem, by immortalizing them in the painting. ''The Burial of the Count of Orgaz'' has been admired not only for its art, but also because it is a gallery of portraits of some of the most important personalities of that time in Toledo. In 1612, [[Francisco de Pisa]] wrote: "The people of our city never grow tired, because [...] there are realistic portraits of many notable men of our times."&lt;ref name="Schroth2"&gt;S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of the painting==
[[File:El Greco - Count Orgasz - face.jpg|thumb|Detail of the painting.]]
According to the terms stipulated in the contract and the prevailing scholarly approach, the painting is divided into two zones, juxtaposing the earthly with the heavenly world, which are brought together compositionally (e.g., by the standing figures, by their varied participation in the earthly and heavenly event, by the torches, cross etc.).&lt;ref name="BrL"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 76&lt;br /&gt;* S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 7&lt;br /&gt; * {{cite encyclopedia|title=Greco, El|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|last=H. Wethey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franz Philipp emphasizes on the element of the assumption of the soul (''assumptio animae''), and argues that the work should be considered as tripartite: the central division of the painting is occupied by the ''assumptio animae'', in the form of a newborn, "ethereal" baby.&lt;ref&gt;F. Philipp, "El Greco's Entombment", 78–82&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's perception of the soul and its ascent, which evolved from a [[Neoplatonism and Christianity|Neoplatonic basis]], is a possible inspiration for the painter's imagery of ''assumptio animae''.&lt;ref name="D70"&gt;D. Davies, "El Greco &amp; the Reform Movements in Spain", 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Greco's way of thematically and artistically linking the upper with the lower zone of the painting has been characterized by art scholars as ingenuous, and as further accomplishing the main message of the painting, that veneration and good works lead to [[Salvation in Christianity|
salvation]].&lt;ref name="Schroth79"&gt;S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 7, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the upper part, the heavenly one, the clouds have parted to receive the "righteous man" in [[Paradise]]. Heaven is evoked by swirling icy clouds, semiabstract in their shape, and the saints are tall and phantomlike. [[Depiction of Jesus|Christ]], clad in white and in glory, is a radiance of light, and the crowning point of the triangle formed by the figures of the [[The Madonna|Madonna]] and [[Saint John the Baptist]] in the traditional [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] composition of the [[Deesis]].&lt;ref name="Plaka55"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco-The Greek'', 55&lt;br /&gt;* D. Davies, "El Greco &amp; the Reform Movements in Spain", 70&lt;br /&gt;* S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 9&lt;/ref&gt; These three central figures of heavenly glory are surrounded by apostles, martyrs, Biblical figures (including [[Moses]], [[Noah]] and [[David]]) as well as [[Philip II of Spain]], though he was still alive. The "righteous" Philip II is spiritually united with Christ and the heavenly creatures in a [[The City of God|City of God]] as conceived by Augustine.&lt;ref name="D70" /&gt; In the central part of the composition, an angel powerfully pushes the nascent soul upwards, a movement interpreted once again as a visualization of the Counter-Reformation teaching of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Maré, "The Being and Movement of the Angel", ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene of the miracle is depicted in the lower part of the composition, in the terrestrial section, where all is normal as regards the scale and proportions of the figures.&lt;ref name="Plaka55" /&gt; Saint Augustine, bearing the characteristics of [[Gaspar de Quiroga y Vela]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toledo|Archbishop of Toledo]], and Saint Stephen, in golden and red vestments respectively, bend reverently over the body of the count, who is clad in magnificent armor that reflects the yellow and reds of the other figures. The armor is contemporary with Greco's time, and inspired by the ceremonial military dress of the Spanish royals as depicted in [[Titian]]'s portraits.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 76, 78&lt;/ref&gt; The noblemen contemplate the event in a detached and restrained manner. Their subdued composure has been interpreted either as another visual element of the didactic purpose of the painting under the Counter-Reformation influence or as an expression of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine origins]] of Greco's art.&lt;ref name="Plaka767"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 76&lt;br /&gt;* S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 7&lt;/ref&gt; The young boy at the left is El Greco's son, Jorge Manuel; on a handkerchief in his pocket is inscribed the artist's signature and the date 1578, the year of the boy's birth. Jorge Manuel's inclusion emphasizes the didactic purpose of the painting: the boy occupies a prominent position close to the spectator's view, directing the latter with his pointing finger.&lt;ref name="Schroth3"&gt;S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 3&lt;/ref&gt; The artist himself can be recognised directly above the raised hand of a knight of the [[Order of Santiago]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 78&lt;br /&gt;* [[Web Gallery of Art]], [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/greco_el/09/index.html The Burial of the Count of Orgaz]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting has a chromatic harmony that is incredibly rich, expressive and radiant. On the black mourning garments of the nobles are projected the gold-embroidered vestments, thus creating an intense ceremonial character. In the heavenly space there is a predominance of transparent harmonies of iridescence and ivoried greys, which harmonize with the gilded ochres, while in the Madonna's maforium (mantle) deep blue is closely combined with bright red. The rhetoric of the expressions, the glances and the gestural translation make the scene very moving.&lt;ref name="Plaka55-56"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco-The Greek'', 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
[[File:Dormition El Greco.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Dormition of the Virgin]]''. The ''Dormition'' was suggested as the compositional model for ''The Burial of the Count of Orgaz''.]]

The composition of the painting has been closely related to the Byzantine [[iconography]] of the [[Dormition of the Mother of God]]. The argumentation supporting this point of view focuses on the icon of the ''[[Dormition of the Virgin (El Greco)|Dormition]]'' by El Greco that was discovered in 1983 in the church of the same name in [[Syros]].&lt;ref name="Plaka55" /&gt; Robert Byron, according to whom the iconographic type of the ''Dormition'' was the compositional model for ''The Burial of the Count of Orgaz'', asserts that El Greco as a genuine Byzantine painter worked throughout his life with a repertoire of components and motifs at will, depending on the narrative and expressive requirements of the art.&lt;ref name="Byron160"&gt;R. Byron, ''Greco: The Epilogue to Byzantine Culture'', 160–174&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Harold Wethey]] rejects as "unconvincing" the view that the composition of the ''Burial'' is derived from the ''Dormition'', "since the work is more immediately related to Italian Renaissance prototypes". In connection with its elimination of spatial depth by compressing figures into the foreground, the early Florentine Mannerists—[[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Pontormo]] and [[Parmigianino]]—are mentioned, as well two paintings by [[Tintoretto]]: the ''Crucifixion'' and the ''Resurrection of Lazarus'', the latter because of the horizontal row of spectators behind the miracle. The elliptical grouping of the two saints, as they lower the dead body, is said to be closer to Titian's early ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Titian)|Entombment]]'' than to any other work. Wethey asserts that "El Greco's Mannerist method of composition is nowhere more clearly expressed than here, where all of the action takes place in the frontal plane".&lt;ref&gt;H.E. Wethey, ''El Greco and his School'', II, 56, 80, and 97&lt;br /&gt;* {{cite encyclopedia|title=Greco, El|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|last=H.E. Wethey}}&lt;br /&gt;* F. Philipp, "El Greco's Entombment", 76&lt;br /&gt;* S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Philipp argues that the painting is heavily influenced by the contemporary Spanish [[funerary art]], and that Greco adhered to this sepulchrar artistic tradition while adapting a popular religious subject, the [[Burial of Jesus|Entombment of Christ]], to the needs of his assignment.&lt;ref&gt;F. Philipp, "El Greco's Entombment", ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Schroth believes that Titian's ''Entombment'' is used by Greco as a model to subtly pass his didactic message for the value of good works, and she mentions [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s ''[[Adoration of the Trinity]]'' as an inspiration for the painting's bi-partite composition and the depiction of contemporary laymen in the lower, earthly zone.&lt;ref name="Schroth79" /&gt; However, Scroth departs from Wethey's absolute rejection of the presence of Byzantine elements in the painting, and accepts ''Dormition'' as an influence for the ''Burial'' 's depiction of the ''assumptio animae''. A third work of Tintoretto, ''The Last Judgment'', is mentioned by Schroth as a possible influence for the ''Burial'' 's depiction of Gloria, since Greco wanted to incorporate elements of the funeral liturgy in the upper part of the painting.&lt;ref name="Schroth"&gt;S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessments==
Regardless of their different approaches in relation to the painting's influences, the ''Burial'' is unanimously celebrated by art scholars as a masterpiece. It is also regarded as the first completely personal work of the artist, the culmination of his first ten years of creativity in Toledo, initiating his mature artistic period, as well as the processes of spiritualization and dematerialization, which will continue in his later works.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 81&lt;br /&gt;* [[Web Gallery of Art]], [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/greco_el/09/index.html The Burial of the Count of Orgaz]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lambraki-Plaka, the ''Burial'' is a landmark in the artist's career: "This is where El Greco sets before us, in a highly compressed form the wisdom he has brought to his art, his knowledge, his expertise, his composite imagination and his expressive power. It is the living encyclopedia of his art without ceasing to be a masterpiece with organic continuity and entelechy".&lt;ref name="Plaka55-56" /&gt;

The impressive depiction of prominent members of the Toledan society in the lower zone establishes Greco as an accomplished [[portrait]]ist, with a profound knowledge of physiognomy and gestures. The chromatic harmony and the use of incredibly rich, expressive and radiant colors confirm his talent as a colorist, while the scenes depicted on the embroidered vestments reveal a gifted [[miniature art|miniaturist]]. The overall composition with the innovative elements already mentioned—the peculiar synthesis of the real with the surreal, the negation of spacial depth and the impressive array of portraits—unveil all aspects of Greco's extraordinary art.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 81&lt;br /&gt;* [[Web Gallery of Art]], [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/greco_el/09/index.html The Burial of the Count of Orgaz]&lt;br /&gt;* {{cite encyclopedia|title=Greco, El|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|last=H.E. Wethey}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interpreting the remark of Francisco de Pisa in relation to the painting, that "there are always new things to contemplate in it", Schroth characterizes the ''Burial'' as an "inexhaustible source of instruction as well as pleasure".&lt;ref name="Schroth14"&gt;S.

'''''The City''''' is a [[book]] by [[Max Weber]], a German [[economist]] and [[sociologist]]. It was published posthumously in 1921.  In 1924 it was incorporated into a larger book, ''[[Economy and Society]]''.  An English translation was made in 1958 and several editions have been released since then.  It is still in print: a paperback edition was issued in Glencoe, Illinois by Free Press in 1986 with {{ISBN|0-02-934210-4}} .

It is likely that Weber compiled that research in 1911–1913, although it contains materials he found before that time.

The analysis of [[city]] consists of many different subjects—including study of [[religion]] (especially [[Protestantism]]), history of development of [[democracy]] in [[Western Europe]].

Weber argues that the development of cities in European [[culture]] ([[western culture|Occidental]] cities) as an [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] [[Voluntary association|associations]] with its own [[municipal]] [[officials]] was influenced by such factors as:

* the religion of [[Christianity]]
* the privileged legal position of the [[citizen]]s (based upon citizen's obligation for military service)
* the decline of religious sanctions of [[kinship]] solidarity that facilitated creation of unified urban community

That made the city's population easily influenced by later ideas of the [[Reformation|Reformers]].

In Weber's own words:

{{quote|The origin of a rational and inner-worldly ethic is associated in the Occident with the appearance of thinkers and prophets [...] who developed in a social context which was alien to the Asiatic cultures. This context consisted of the political problems engendered by the bourgeois status-group of the city, without which neither Judaism, nor Christianity, nor the development of Hellenistic thinking are conceivable.}}

'''''The Day I Shot Cupid: Hello, My Name Is Jennifer Love Hewitt and I'm a Love-aholic''''' (commonly abbreviated to ''The Day I Shot Cupid'') is a bestselling dating-advice book written by [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]. The book tells of Hewitt's personal dating experiences and gives advice to both men and women on dating life and what to look for in a member of the opposite sex.

==Development==
Hewitt has often been described as a 'serial dater' in the media and after many publicized relationships, rumors, and break-ups she revealed that she was planning on writing a relationship book. She has said she wanted to set the record straight on her love-life and talk about the rumors in a personal and honest way. Hewitt said in interviews that the name of the book came to her after she did some research about the god of desire ([[Cupid]]) and discovered that in the original [[myth]], after being scorned by love, Cupid didn't shoot people with arrows to make them fall in love, he shot them with poison arrows to make them fall ''out'' of love. Hewitt felt that she needed to 'shoot' Cupid to get him to stop.&lt;ref name="Foxtube"&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doILj8S7fbA Interview: Jennifer Love Hewitt]", ''[[Fox News]]'' (2010). Retrieved on 22 September 2010 via [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout writing the book, Hewitt was dating ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' co-star [[Jamie Kennedy]]. He wrote a chapter in the book where he writes that men usually prefer women with curves and 'booty', perhaps in relation to Hewitt's much publicized retaliation about the criticism of her weight by the media in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/24/jennifer-love-hewitt-show_n_510817.html Jennifer Love Hewitt Shows Some Leg To Sell Her Book ]", ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', 24 March 2010.

Retrieved 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She and Kennedy later broke off their year-long relationship just before she began doing promotional tours and appearances for the book.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Tracy; "[http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/03/13/2010-03-13_jennifer_love_hewitt_and_jamie_kennedy_break_up.html Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jamie Kennedy break up]", ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', 13 March 2010. Retrieved 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She joked about this in some promotional interviews, saying "It wasn't ideal timing. Here's my relationship book and I'm single".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyxyhgtjZPc The Day I Shot Cupid: Jennifer Love Hewitt's Book]", ''[[TV Guide]]'', 22 March 2010. Retrieved 22 September 2010 via [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cover==
The cover features an image of a [[cartoon]] version of Hewitt kneeling down in a sleek dress. The title art shows a fallen [[Cupid]] slumped over his name after being shot in the back with Hewitt's [[metaphorical]] arrow. The back cover features a picture of Jennifer and the front and back flaps feature a brief synopsis of both the book and Hewitt respectively.

==Promotion==
Hewitt undertook a large promotional campaign leading up to the book's release. She was interviewed by many TV networks and talk-shows in the U.S. During the interviews she stressed that "despite what your pre-conceived notion about what my life is like or what people have written about me, I am just a girl like you."&lt;ref name="Foxtube"/&gt;

While promoting the book during a January, 2010, interview on ''[[Lopez Tonight]]'', Hewitt said that there is a chapter in it about "[[vajazzle|vajazzling]]" (decorating a woman's pubis with crystals or rhinestones). She said it looked "cute", revealed that she was currently vajazzled with "hot pink" crystals and recommended to all women that they should also try it and see how it can raise their confidence. This became a big internet hit with the video going [[viral video|viral]], widespread news coverage and the term "vajazzling" becoming one of the most searched terms on [[Google]] the next day.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2010/01/jennifer-love-hewitt-explains-her-precious-lady-jewels/1 Jennifer Love Hewitt Explains Her Precious Lady Jewels]", ''[[USA Today]]'', 13 January 2010.

Retrieved 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Helium.com gave the book a positive review, saying "Jennifer Love Hewitt’s book provides some good guidelines for those that need to work on clarifying their relationship desires before trying to establish their relationships". Talesofwhimsy.com said the book was "charming, honest, zany, and real", adding that "This book is pure fun. I want a copy for my coffee table and single cousin". Crushable.com gave the book a mixed review, mentioning that "Hewitt is a trite and terrible writer - no getting around that - but she makes some good points". The book was commercially successful upon its release, becoming a [[New York Times bestseller|''New York Times'' bestseller]] within a week.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/books/bestseller/besthardadvice.html Hardcover Advice]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2 April 2010. Retrieved 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In June, 2011, Hewitt confirmed via her [[Twitter]] account that she was in the process of writing another book. Although no specific details were released, she stated that writing was "going well" and that she was excited about the project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/TheReal_Jlh/status/85883707344429056 TheReal_Jlh tweet], ''[[Twitter]]'', 29 June 2011.

'''''The Excursion to Tilsit''''' is a 1917 collection of short stories or novellas by the German writer [[Hermann Sudermann]]. Its German title is '''''Litauische Geschichten''''', which means "Lithuanian stories". The book consists of four stories set in rural Lithuania in the mid 19th century. It was published in English in 1930, translated by Lewis Galantière.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/excursion-to-tilsit/oclc/1474999|title=The excursion to Tilsit|work=[[WorldCat]]|accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several stories from the book have been adapted for film. Most famously, [[F. W. Murnau]]'s 1927 film ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' is loosely based on the titular story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fischer|first=Lucy|year=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V96tee1l2q8C&amp;pg=PA75|chapter=Sunrise: A Tale of Two Humans|editor1-last=White|editor1-first=Rob|editor2-last=Buscombe|editor2-first=Edward|title=British Film Institute Film Classics, Volume 1|location=London; New York|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]; [[Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|Fitzroy Dearborn]]|page=75|isbn=1-57958-328-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Excursion to Tilsit''' (Die Reise nach Tilsit)&lt;br /&gt;

'''Miks Bumbullis'''&lt;br /&gt;
A murderer needs to visit the grave of his daughter to please the goddess of death, despite knowing that the police will be there waiting for him.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Jons and Erdma''' (Jons und Erdme)&lt;br /&gt;

'''The Hired Girl''' (Die Magd)

==Reception==
Margaret Wallace of ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like [[Selma Lagerlöf]], and many other novelists whose material is national and even provincial, Sudermann by his very unconcern with cosmopolitan values gives a deeper truth and meaning to the lives of his characters. Of these four stories of Lithuanian peasants, only one, "Miks Bumbullis", depends for its effect upon purely national traits and circumstances. They are, for the most part, founded solidly upon the fundamental and inescapable human facts of birth and love and death. They are moving and tragic and, above all, intensely and vividly alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wallace|first=Margaret|year=April 1930|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Bookman-1930apr-00214a03|title=''The Excursion to Tilsit'' by Hermann Sudermann|work=[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]|page=214-215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]]'' reviewed the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Excursion to Tilsit'' by Hermann Sudermann is a collection of powerful short stories dealing with the life of Lithuanian peasants. The author has observed them sympathetically and at first hand. Nominal Catholics, they still live in fear of pagan gods, giving even their lives to propitiate them. ... Among the stories, that of Jons and Erdma who, having built a home by tricks and cunning are tricked out of it at last by their daughters, compares favorably with [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgeniev's]] ''Lear of the Steppes'' as a story of faith and treachery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=1930-04-02|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Outlook-1930apr02-00544a02|title=The Leisure Arts: The Week's Reading|work=[[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]]|page=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''What Happened to Burger's Daughter or How South African Censorship Works''''' is a 1980 collection of essays by South African novelist [[Nadine Gordimer]] and others. The book is about the South African government's banning and subsequent unbanning of Gordimer's 1979 novel ''[[Burger's Daughter]]''.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;

The book was published in [[Johannesburg]] by Taurus Publications, a small [[Underground press|underground]] publishing house established in the late-1970s to print anti-apartheid literature and other material South African publishers would avoid for fear of censorship. Its publications were generally distributed privately or sent to bookshops to be given to customers free to avoid attracting the attention of the South African authorities.&lt;ref name="jstor3818653"/&gt;&lt;ref name=achievement-int1/&gt;

==Essays==
*"What Happened to Burger's Daughter" by [[Nadine Gordimer]]
*"Reasons for the Ban" by Richard Smith (Director of Publications)
*"What the Book is About" by Nadine Gordimer
*"Reasons for Lifting the Ban" by Publications Appeal Board
*"What the Literary Press Thought of the Novel"
*"Censorship in South Africa: The Legal Framework" by [[John Dugard]]
*"A Short List of Recently Banned Books"

==Synopsis==
In the book's titular essay, Gordimer documents the publication history and fate of ''[[Burger's Daughter]]'', and investigates the implications of the banning and unbanning of works in South Africa.&lt;ref name="jstor40135909"/&gt; The official communiqué by the Director of Publications, Richard Smith stating his reason for banning the book a month after publication is reproduced here in full. These charges include "propagating Communist opinions", "creating a psychosis of revolution and rebellion", and "making several unbridled attacks against the authority entrusted with the maintenance of law and order and the safety of the state".&lt;ref name=Gardner/&gt; In another essay by Gordimer, "What the Book is About", she responds to each of the charges, showing how, by extensively quoting out of context, the Publications Control Board displayed their "inability ... to pass qualified judgment" on the book.&lt;ref name="jstor40135909"/&gt;

The reasons for lifting the ban by the Publications Appeal Board three months later, on the recommendation of a panel of literary experts and a state security specialist, are also reproduced here. The state security specialist had reported that the book posed no threat to the security of South Africa, and the literary experts had accused the censorship board "of bias, prejudice, and literary incompetence", and that "[i]t has not read accurately, it has severely distorted by quoting extensively out of context, it has not considered the work as a literary work deserves to be considered, and it has directly, and by implication, smeared the authoress [sic]."&lt;ref name="Karolides2006"/&gt; In the final essay in the book [[University of the Witwatersrand]] law professor [[John Dugard]] examines censorship in South Africa within the country's legal framework.&lt;ref name="jstor40135909"/&gt;

==Reception==
In a review published in ''[[World Literature Today]]'', Carrol Lasker wrote that in ''What Happened to Burger's Daughter'',  Gordimer investigates the "sinister implications of the practice of banning and unbanning", and described the book as "a dramatic, detailed and useful model" of the workings of censorship in South Africa.&lt;ref name="jstor40135909"/&gt; Writing in ''Research in African Literatures'', Sheila Roberts said that the book "exposes in a thorough and unprecedented way the bungling and ignorance of a censorship committee" and its "pathetic face-saving efforts" to undo the damage it had done.&lt;ref name="jstor3818653"/&gt;
