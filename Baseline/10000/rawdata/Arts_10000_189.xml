{{About|literary use of the phrase|1917 painting by Paul Klee|Ab ovo (painting)|biological alternative to spontaneous generation|Omne vivum ex ovo}}
[[File:Leda and the Swan 1505-1510.jpg|thumb|''Leda and the Swan'', a painting depicting Helen's unconventional birth, by [[Cesare da Sesto]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1506&amp;ndash;1510, [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]]) after a lost painting by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Helen and [[Clytemnestra]] are shown emerging from one egg; [[Castor and Pollux]] from another.]]
'''''Ab ovo''''' ([[Latin]]: "from the beginning, the origin, the [[egg (biology)|egg]]") is a reference to one of the twin eggs from which [[Helen of Troy#Birth|Helen of Troy was born]]. The eggs were laid by [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] after mating with [[Zeus]] disguised as a swan. Had [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] not laid the egg, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] would not have been born, so [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] could not have eloped with her, so there would have been no [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;Helen of Troy: From Homer to Hollywood. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. Chichester, West Sussex, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature ==

The [[English language|English]] literary use of the phrase comes from [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', where he describes his ideal epic poet as one who "does not begin the Trojan War from the double egg" (''nec gemino bellum Troianum orditur ab ouo''), the absolute beginning of events, the earliest possible chronological point, but snatches the listener into the middle of things (''[[in medias res]]''). This advice is famously rejected in [[Laurence Sterne]]'s novel [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]].

This use is distinct from the longer phrase ''[[ab ovo usque ad mala]]'' (lit. "from the egg to the apples") which appears in Horace's [[Sermonum liber primus|''Satire'']] 1.3.  It refers to the course of a Roman meal, which often began with eggs and ended with fruit, and is similar to the American English phrase "[[wikt:from soup to nuts#Adverb|soup to nuts]]".  Thus ''ab ovo'' can also be used to mean a complete or entire thing.

[[File:Louis Sullivan circa 1895.jpg|thumb|Louis Sullivan circa 1895]]

The '''American Prize for Architecture''',&lt;ref&gt;https://chi-athenaeum.org/american-architecture-prize.html&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the Louis H. Sullivan Award, is bestowed to an outstanding practitioner in the [[United States]] that has emblazoned a new direction in the history of [[Architecture of the United States|American Architecture]] with [[Aptitude|talent]], [[Foresight (psychology)|vision]], and commitment and has demonstrated consistent contributions to humanity through the built environment and through the art of [[architecture]].
 
The [[award]] periodically honors North and South American architects, as well as other global architects practicing on those continents, whose body of architectural work, over time, exemplifies superior design and humanist ideals.
 
==History==
Instituted in 1994 as The [[Louis H. Sullivan]] Award, The American Prize for Architecture honors the spirit of the founder of modernism, Louis Sullivan, and a subsequent generation of [[Chicago]] practitioners as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Daniel Burnham|Daniel H. Burnham]].
 
The American Prize for Architecture was founded in [[Chicago]] by The [[Chicago Athenaeum]]: Museum of Architecture and Design, and is organized jointly with The European Centre for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies as a way to broadcast globally the significant contributions of America’s rich and inspiring architecture practice and its legacy to the world at large.
 
The Director of the prize and President of The Chicago Athenaeum, [[Christian Narkiewicz-Laine]], is the curator of the Prize and the Museum solicits nominations from a range of people, including global practitioners, educators, people in business, and the general public. The American Prize for Architecture is a trademark of The Chicago Athenaeum.

==Previous laureates==
Some previous American Prize for Architecture [[laureate]]s include: [[Michael Graves]] (1994), [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Sir Norman Foster]] (1996),  General Services Administration (Richard Feiner) (1997), [[Richard Meier]] (1998), [[Adrian Smith (architect)|Adrian Smith]] + Gordon Gill Architects (2016) and Form4 Architecture (2017),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archdaily.com/869409/form4-architecture-wins-2017-american-prize-for-architecture&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James von Klemperer]] of [[Kohn Pedersen Fox]] (2018). &lt;ref&gt;https://chi-athenaeum.org/essays-page/2018/06/14/american-prize-for-architecture-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''aristeia''' or '''aristia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|ᵻ|ˈ|s|t|iː|ə}}; {{lang-grc|ἀριστεία}} {{IPA-el|aristěːaː|}}, ''"excellence"'') is a scene in the dramatic conventions of epic poetry as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', where a [[hero]] in battle has his finest moments (''aristos'' = "best"). An aristeia can result in the death of the hero at the aristeia's end.

==Examples==
One of the most prototypical examples of ''aristeia'' is in ''Book 21'' of the Iliad when [[Achilles]] almost single-handedly routs the [[Troy|Trojan]] army. This  includes his chase of [[Hector]] around [[Troy]]; Achilles eventually succeeds in killing him and dragging his corpse around the city.&lt;ref name=Iliad&gt;{{cite book|last=Homer|title=The Iliad|year=800 BC|page=Book XXI|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.21.xxi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other instances of this phenomenon in the ''Iliad'' are found in [[Diomedes]]' performance in battle while empowered by [[Athena]] (''Book V''), [[Hector]]'s leading of the Trojan assault on the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaian]] camp in ''Book VIII'' (with the help of [[Zeus]]), [[Agamemnon]]'s aristeia in Book XI where he's on such a rampage that Zeus himself has to warn Hector against meeting him in battle, as well as [[Patroclus]]' aristeia in ''Book XVI'', which ultimately leads to his demise at the hands of [[Hector]]. In ''Book XXII'' of the [[Odyssey]], Greek hero [[Odysseus]] slaughters all of the suitors in his palace in another homeric display of martial excellence.
It is also seen, to some extent, in the [[Aeneid]], when [[Nisus and Euryalus]] leave the Trojan defenses to slaughter the Latin captains while they sleep. It also features in ''Book X'', when [[Mezentius]] takes the place of [[Turnus]] and strikes down all in his path: it draws upon homeric models, using a [[simile]].

'''''Aristotle''''' is a 1637 [[oil painting]] by [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Jusepe de Ribera]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. It is part of a series of six portraits of ancient philosophers commissioned by the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]] in 1636.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Aristotle]] is here portrayed as a beggar-philosopher, a popular conceit in the seventeenth century. His asceticism is well in keeping with Spanish Catholicism, and is a hallmark of the saints Ribera also painted. He is surrounded by light reminiscent of [[Caravaggio]], with whom Ribera is often associated.&lt;ref name=day/&gt; That, and his direct, naturalistic style (also courtesy of Caravaggio) make this a powerful image of a philosopher and his profound contemplations. Aristotle is painted in a very tactile manner, with deep creases in his worn face and hands. Ribera proudly signed the painting across the papers in Aristotle's hand, appending "español" to his name to assert his nationality.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

==Historical information==
When [[Karl Eusebius, Prince of Liechtenstein]] originally commissioned this series in May 1636, the request was for a full dozen paintings. However, only the first six were ever delivered. These were listed in a 1767 inventory as Aristotle, [[Plato]], [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]], [[Anaxagoras]], [[Protagoras]], and [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]]. The set was sold and scattered in 1957, although briefly reunited by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1992 for a Ribera exhibition.&lt;ref name=moma/&gt;

The identification of this particular image has been somewhat problematic over the years. Although the 1767 inventory was clear enough, only Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Crates are identified by inscriptions on the paintings. The current consensus is that the doctor's robe and scholar's skullcap mean this image must be Aristotle. However, for years, the IMA identified the subject as [[Archimedes]] due to the geometric drawings in his hand, although that particular philosopher was not mentioned in the inventory.&lt;ref name=moma/&gt;&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|year=1988|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location history===
From 1637 until 1957, the Princes of Lichtenstein retained possession of the painting. Then it was purchased by Dr. G.H.A. Clowes, who generously lent it to the IMA.&lt;ref name=moma&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pérez Sánchez|first1=Alfonso E.|last2=Spinosa|first2=Nicola|title=Jusepe de Ribera, 1591-1652|year=1992|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|location=[[New York, New York]]|isbn=0870996479|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h_pQSwFmcZkC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=jusepe+de+ribera+philosophers+liechtenstein+1637&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6ILIs6JnTy&amp;sig=nk1bfrhWyh3JotLhkvg-ueKb6RQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=owwUUeSfGYWxygHw-YDwDw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=jusepe%20de%20ribera%20philosophers%20liechtenstein%201637&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The IMA officially acquired ''Aristotle'' in 2000, courtesy of the Clowes family, and gave it the accession number 2000.345. It hangs in the Clowes Pavilion with many other donations from that family.&lt;ref name=IMA&gt;{{cite web|title=Aristotle|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/aristotle-ribera-jusepe-de|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''art squat''' is a name used to describe the action of artists to occupy (or [[Squatting|squat]] in) an abandoned building, thereby creating studio space to create art. Art squats often have a semi-legal or illegal status.

[[Kunsthaus Tacheles|Tacheles]], in [[Berlin]], Germany, was one of many buildings occupied by artists in the years after [[World War II]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/arts/writings-on-the-wall-for-art-squat/2009/01/26/1232818332460.html?page=fullpage "Writing's on the wall for art squat"], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', January 27, 2009. Retrieved 2013-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to operate as a studio space and gallery until 2012, when the authorities closed it for redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Jones, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/sep/05/closure-tacheles-berlin-sad-alternative-art "The closure of Berlin's Tacheles squat is a sad day for alternative art"], Jonathan Jones on Art (blog), ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 5, 2012.

Paris, France, has experienced several decades of art squats, a result of high rents and a large [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] artist population.&lt;ref name="Fills the Void"&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/travel/31headsup.html?_r=1&amp; "In Paris, Art Fills the Void"], ''The New York Times (travel)'', January 26, 2010. Retrieved 2013-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples include the [[Bateau-Lavoir]] (destroyed during the 1970s) and Hôpital Éphémère, occupied during the 1980s and 90s.&lt;ref name="Fills the Void" /&gt; In the 2000s the Paris city hall began an initiative to redevelop and legalise the city's art squats, beginning with a 6-storey squat on [[rue de Rivoli, Paris|rue de Rivoli]] which was renovated and reopened in 2009.&lt;ref name="Fills the Void" /&gt;

Art Squat was also the name of an Artists Collective co-founded by [[Johnny Otto]] in [[Los Angeles]] in the early 90's, which took over abandoned properties in the Fairfax District and converted them into Galleries. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.artrevealmagazine.com/johnny-otto-ottophobia-conspiracy-propaganda-art/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashton Lane''' is a cobbled backstreet in the [[Glasgow#The West End|West End]] of [[Glasgow]]. It is connected to [[Byres Road]] by a short linking lane beside [[Hillhead subway station]] and is noted for its bars, restaurants and a licensed cinema.
[[File:Glasgow westend (31).JPG|thumb|right|240px|Off the main thoroughfare of [[Byres Road]], Ashton Lane is a focus for bars, cafes and restaurants.]]

==Overview==
The Lane was not always the focus of West End cafe society. By the early 1970s, it was a run-down area of small residential and empty commercial properties. However, in 1976, the cost to renew the lease on the cramped property in Ruthven Lane that housed the Ubiquitous Chip restaurant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/16/ubiquitous-chip-glasgow-restaurant-review|title=The Ubiquitous Chip, Glasgow – restaurant review {{!}} Marina O'Loughlin|last=O'Loughlin|first=Marina|date=2014-05-16|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; forced the owner to look for new premises. 'The Chip', as it is locally known, moved to its current location in a derelict property that had been the stables for a funeral undertaker. The move was a gamble for the owner, Ronnie Clydesdale, since the Lane was a backwater to the thriving [[Byres Road|Byres Rd]] but in 1977 the [[Glasgow Underground|Glasgow Subway]] closed for a major refurbishment. This forced several small businesses to relocate from [[Byres Road|Byres Rd]] and the then-famous Grosvenor Cafe followed The Chip into Ashton Lane.

[[File:AshtonLaneGlasgow.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Ashton Lane, looking from Great George Street.]]

Other bars and restaurants were opened: the Cul-de-Sac creperie in the former [[Barr and Stroud]] factory and Bar Brel in the old coachhouse that had been used latterly as a landscape gardener's yard but was, in 1910, the chauffeur’s house and garage for Dr Marion Gilchrist’s 'prim dark green Wolseley landaulette'. Dr Gilchrist (1864-1952) was, in 1894, the first woman to graduate in medicine in Scotland.

[[File:CresswellLaneGlasgow.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Cresswell Lane, Glasgow.]]

The Grosvenor Picture Theatre was built on site of Henderson’s Cab and Funeral Office in Byres Road and Ashton Lane. The cinema opened on 3 May 1921 with 'Helen of the Four Gates' and 'Eastwards Ho' and the performances were accompanied by the theatre’s own orchestra and organist. The building was designed by architects Gardner &amp; Glen and had a distinctive terracotta façade. The original entrance faced Byres Road and the upper level housed a Café and American Soda Fountain and, by 1929, a waiting room. The original cinema seated around 1,350 people, but in the 1970s it underwent considerable reconstruction. The entrance was moved from Byres Rd to Ashton Lane, and the old entrance became Bonham's Wine Bar (the railing in the original foyer is retained in the upstairs bar). After falling into disrepair, the cinema closed 30 June 2002, but was relaunched in October 2003 after a multimillion-pound refurbishment. This created two screens on the ground floor, a bar and restaurant in the former neglected roof space and a new cafe/bar on Ashton Lane. The cinema now has two screens, each seating a hundred people and shows a mix of blockbuster and art-house movies. 

Today, bars and restaurants occupy most of the premises in Ashton Lane. The Famous Grosvenor Cafe and the now internationally renowned 'Chip' remain a defining feature. Some like Jinty McGuintys Irish Bar have been there a while too, almost 25 years.

Ashton Lane continues north as Cresswell Lane, where the variety of bars and restaurants is supplemented by a gallery of small specialist shops. The Lane and its surroundings might then be regarded as Glasgow's equivalent of [[Dublin]]'s [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] area or [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Rose Street]]. While still popular with local residents and students, it is now firmly established on the Glasgow tourist trail.

'''Axonometric projection ''' is a type of [[orthographic projection]] used for creating a pictorial drawing of an object, where the lines of sight are perpendicular to the plane of projection, and the object is rotated around one or more of its axes to reveal multiple sides.&lt;ref name="Bert02"&gt;Gary R. Bertoline et al. (2002) ''Technical Graphics Communication''. McGraw–Hill Professional, 2002. {{ISBN|0-07-365598-8}}, p.&amp;nbsp;330.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
"Axonometry" means "to measure along axes". In German literature, [[axonometry]] is based on [[Pohlke's theorem]], so that the scope of axonometric projection encompasses ''every'' type of [[parallel projection]], including not only [[oblique projection]], but also [[orthographic projection]] and therefore [[multiview projection]]. However, outside of German literature, the term "axonometric" is often used to make an explicit distinction from multiview projection, because axonometric projection ''allows'' for the depiction of more than one "side" of an object, whereas a multiview projection allows for the depiction of only one "side" of an object:  
* A multiview projection depicts an object from one of six ''primary views'' (e.g. front, right, left, top, bottom, or back); one of the principal axes of the object (e.g., the ''z'' or "depth" axis) is necessarily perpendicular to the projection plane, and thus such a projection can depict only one "side" of the object. Because multiview projections are a fundamental facet of technical illustration, a depiction that results from another type of projection is often called an "''auxiliary''" view.
* In contrast, an axonometric projection ''may'' depict an object such that ''none'' of the principal axes of the object is perpendicular to the projection plane, and thus more than one "side" of an object may be represented simultaneously (that is to say, the ''z'' or "depth" axis may be represented); usually, the projection is such that the images of any 2 axes are not collinear, so that the angles between projected lines help to distinguish each dimension. when it is possible to depict more than one side of an object, it may be said that the object is being viewed from a "skew" angle.
Furthermore, in English literature, the term "axonometric projection" typically implies an orthographic projection, such as an [[isometric projection]].

With an axonometric projection, the scale of an object does not depend on its location along any particular axis (an object in the "foreground" has the same scale as an object in the "background"); consequently, such pictures look distorted, because [[human vision]] or [[photography]] uses [[perspective projection]], in which the scale of an object depends on its location along one of the axes (e.g., the ''z'' or "depth" axis). This distortion, the direct result of a presence or absence of [[foreshortening]], is especially evident if the object is mostly composed of rectangular features. Despite this limitation, axonometric projection can be useful for purposes of illustration, especially because it allows for simultaneously relaying precise measurements.

== Three types ==
[[File:Graphical projection comparison.png|thumb|right|Comparison of several types of [[graphical projection]]]]
[[File:Various projections of cube above plane.svg|thumb|Various projections and how they are produced]]
[[Image:Axonometric projections.png|thumb|The three axonometric views. The percentages show the amount of foreshortening.]]

The three types of axonometric projection are [[isometric projection]], ''dimetric projection'', and ''trimetric projection'', depending on the exact angle at which the view deviates from the [[Orthographic_projection|orthogonal]].&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Maynard | first = Patric | title = Drawing distinctions: the varieties of graphic expression | publisher = Cornell University Press | year = 2005 | pages = 22 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y_YqOlXoxMC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic | isbn = 0-8014-7280-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcreynolds"&gt;{{Cite book | last = McReynolds | first = Tom |author2= David Blythe | title = Advanced graphics programming using openGL | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2005 | pages = 502 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bmv2HRpG1bUC&amp;q=trimetric#v=snippet&amp;q=axonometric&amp;f=false | isbn = 1-55860-659-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically in axonometric drawing, as in other types of pictorials, one axis of space is shown as the vertical.

In '''isometric projection''', the most commonly used form of axonometric projection in engineering drawing,&lt;ref name="godse"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Computer graphics | publisher = Technical Publications | year = 1984 | pages = 29 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YkVp-2ZrmyMC&amp;pg=PT224&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic#v=onepage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic | isbn = 81-8431-558-9 | last = Godse | first = A. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the direction of viewing is such that the three axes of space appear equally [[Perspective (graphical)#Foreshortening|foreshortened]], and there is a common angle of 120° between them.  As the distortion caused by foreshortening is uniform, the proportionality between lengths is preserved, and the axes share a common scale; this eases the ability to take measurements directly from the drawing.  Another advantage is that 120° angles are easily constructed using only a [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]].

In '''dimetric projection''', the direction of viewing is such that two of the three axes of space appear equally foreshortened, of which the attendant scale and angles of presentation are determined according to the angle of viewing; the scale of the third direction is determined separately. Dimensional approximations are common in dimetric drawings.{{clarify|date=April 2017}}

In '''trimetric projection''', the direction of viewing is such that all of the three axes of space appear unequally foreshortened. The scale along each of the three axes and the angles among them are determined separately as dictated by the angle of viewing. Dimensional approximations in trimetric drawings are common,{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} and trimetric perspective is seldom used in technical drawings.&lt;ref name="mcreynolds"/&gt;

== History ==
The concept of [[isometry]] had existed in a rough empirical form for centuries, well before Professor [[William Farish (professor)|William Farish]] (1759–1837) of [[Cambridge University]] was the first to provide detailed rules for isometric drawing.&lt;ref&gt;Barclay G. Jones (1986). ''Protecting historic architecture and museum collections from natural disasters''. University of Michigan. {{ISBN|0-409-90035-4}}. p.&amp;nbsp;243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Edmund Moorhouse (1974). ''Visual messages: graphic communication for senior students''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Farish published his ideas in the 1822 paper "On Isometrical Perspective", in which he recognized the "need for accurate technical working drawings free of optical distortion. This would lead him to formulate isometry. Isometry means "equal measures" because the same scale is used for height, width, and depth".&lt;ref name="Kri96"&gt;J. Krikke (1996). "[http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn9/eastasia/krikke.html A Chinese perspective for cyberspace?]". In: ''International Institute for Asian Studies Newsletter'', 9, Summer 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the middle of the 19th century, according to Jan Krikke (2006)&lt;ref name="Kri96"/&gt;  isometry became an "invaluable tool for engineers, and soon thereafter axonometry and isometry were incorporated in the curriculum of architectural training courses in [[Europe]] and the [[United States|U.S.]] The popular acceptance of axonometry came in the 1920s, when [[modernist architects]] from the [[Bauhaus]] and [[De Stijl]] embraced it".&lt;ref name="Kri96"/&gt; De Stijl architects like [[Theo van Doesburg]] used axonometry for their [[architectural design]]s, which caused a sensation when exhibited in [[Paris]] in 1923".&lt;ref name="Kri96"/&gt;

Since the 1920s axonometry, or parallel perspective, has provided an important graphic technique for artists, architects, and engineers. Like linear perspective, axonometry helps depict three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional picture plane. It usually comes as a standard feature of [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems and other visual computing tools.&lt;ref name="Kri00"&gt;Jan Krikke (2000). "Axonometry: a matter of perspective". In: ''Computer Graphics and Applications, IEEE'' Jul/Aug 2000. Vol 20 (4), pp.&amp;nbsp;7–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jan Krikke (2000), "axonometry originated in [[China]]. Its function in Chinese art was similar to [[linear perspective]] in European art. Axonometry, and the pictorial grammar that goes with it, has taken on a new significance with the advent of visual computing".&lt;ref name="Kri00"/&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2011}}

As with all types of [[parallel projection]], objects drawn with axonometric projection do not appear larger or smaller as they lie closer to or farther away from the viewer. While advantageous for [[architectural drawing]]s, where measurements must be taken directly from the image, the result is a perceived distortion, since unlike [[perspective projection]], this is not how human vision or photography normally works. It also can easily result in situations where depth and altitude are difficult to gauge, as is shown in the illustration to the right.

This visual ambiguity has been exploited in [[op art]], as well as "impossible object" drawings. Though not strictly axonometric, [[M. C. Escher]]'s ''[[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]]'' (1961) is a well-known image, in which a channel of water seems to travel unaided along a downward path, only to then paradoxically fall once again as it returns to its source. The water thus appears to disobey the [[Conservation of energy|law of conservation of energy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20874">'''Babies switched at birth''' are [[infant|babies]] who, because of either error or malice, are interchanged with each other at [[childbirth|birth]] or very soon thereafter, leading to the babies being unknowingly raised by parents who are not their biological [[parent]]s. The occurrence is not unknown but rarely discovered in real life{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}, but is much more common as a [[plot device]] in novels and films, such as the TV series ''[[Switched at Birth (TV series)|Switched at Birth]]'' and ''[[Autumn in My Heart]]''.

==As a literary plot device==
The [[plot device]] of babies who are switched at birth, or in their cradles, has been a common one in American fiction since the 18th century.  It is one of the several identifiable characteristics of [[melodrama]] that are plot devices dealing with situations that are highly improbable in real life.&lt;ref name=Merish&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion To American Fiction 1780-1865|editor=Shirley Samuels|page=192|author=Lori Merish|chapter=Melodrama and American Fiction|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-23422-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of this common theme has continued ever since.  The device was used a number of times by [[W. S. Gilbert]], including in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[comic opera]]s ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' and ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.  In both cases, well-born babies were switched with commoners.  [[Mark Twain]] later used this plot device in ''[[The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson]]'' (1893), where two babies, one white and one black, are switched at birth, resulting in both [[passing (racial identity)|passing]] for races that they are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Race, Citizenship, and Law in American Literature|editor=Ross Posnock|pages=174&amp;ndash;182|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-01093-4|chapter=The positivist alternative|author=Gregg Crane}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the themes that [[television film]]s regularly exploited in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Movies at Home: How Hollywood Came to Television|author=Kerry Segrave|page=139|year=1999|publisher=McFarland &amp;amp; Company|isbn=0-7864-0654-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a popular theme in the 1990s and 21st century with (for examples) it being employed as a plot device in ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' (the characters [[Cindy "Mac" Mackenzie]] and [[Madison Sinclair]]), in ''[[Neighbours]]'' (the characters [[Bree Timmins]] and [[Anne Baxter (Neighbours)|Anne Baxter]]), ''[[Night and Day (TV series)|Night and Day]]'' (the characters Jane Harper and Della Wells) and in ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' (children of [[Lauren Fenmore Baldwin]] and [[Sheila Carter]]).  A non-human example occurs in the ''[[Planet of the Apes (franchise)|Planet of the Apes]]'' franchise, when the son of intelligent apes Zira and Cornelius is swapped with a 20th-century circus ape's infant, in order to assure the survival of the offspring that can become sentient. In ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' the characters [[Juanita Solis (daughter)|Juanita Solis]] and [[Acquaintances of Gabrielle Solis#Grace Sanchez|Grace Sanchez]] were switched at birth by a nurse named Teresa Pruitt. In the Philippine television series, ''[[Mara Clara]]'', the characters Mara [[Mara Clara|Davis]]/[[Mara Clara (2010 TV series)|David]] and Clara [[Mara Clara|del]] [[Mara Clara (2010 TV series)|Valle]] were switched at birth by Gary for revenge after his former lover was married to another man. On the [[ABC Family]] series ''[[Switched at Birth (TV series)|Switched at Birth]]'', the characters Bay and Daphne were switched at birth.

Baby switching storylines are a staple of daytime drama, as in the case of ''The Young and the Restless'' mentioned above. Other notable switched-at-birth storylines on American soaps include ''[[One Life to Live]]''{{-'}}s story, begun in 1979, in which prostitute Katrina Karr, who had planned to put her child up for adoption as soon as it was born, and former nun Jenny Vernon both gave birth to girls at the same hospital, at the same time. Jenny's baby died in the maternity ward as Karen Wolek and Marco Dane (posing as a doctor) visited the child. As they knew Katrina had planned to give up her baby girl, Karen and Marco switched the newborns. It was not until 1982 that the truth came out and Jenny tearfully gave baby Mary back to Katrina.

In 2008, another ''One Life to Live'' storyline saw Starr Manning pregnant with Cole Thornhart's baby. Her cousin Jessica Brennan was also pregnant with her late husband's baby. Starr went into labor as her father Todd Manning (later revealed to be his twin brother Victor) planned to kidnap his grandchild and raise the baby secretly with Cole's amnesiac mother Marty Saybrooke. Tess, one of Jessica's alter personalities, had taken control of Jessica's life and went into premature labor. Starr, with the help of the baby's adoptive mother Marcie McBain and Starr's mother Blair Manning, gave birth to a healthy girl, whom she named Hope. Tess's child, named Chloe, was stillborn. The trauma of Chloe's death resulted in the emergence of another alter, Bess, who took Jessica's deceased baby to the hospital and switched her with Starr's healthy child. Seven months later, Jessica realized what had happened and told the truth to her cousin.

Possibly the most complex storyline involving the switched-at-birth plot device ran simultaneously on ''[[All My Children]]'' and ''One Life to Live''.&lt;ref&gt;http://onelifetolive.about.com/library/news/blbaby_switch.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Involved were ''All My Children''{{-'}}s Bianca Montgomery and Babe Chandler, and ''One Life to Live''{{-'}}s Kelly Cramer Buchanan, as well as many other characters.

In [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, the baby Aegon Targaryen was switched with a commoner's baby at some point prior to the Sack of King's Landing in order to save him from being killed during the rebellion against the Targaryen dynasty. After the commoner's baby is killed, everyone believes that Aegon is dead when in fact he is preparing to take back his grandfather's throne.

In the 1971 manga/anime ''[[Wandering Sun]] / Nozomi in the Sun'' (''Sasurai no Taiyou''), Miki and Nozomi are two girls who were switched at birth by the nurse Michiko Nohara, who holds a personal grudge against one of the families involved. Miki should've been raised as the daughter of the poor but loving Mine family but instead is taken in by the rich and snobbish Kouda clan, and Nozomi the opposite. The deceit isn't properly revealed until almost the end of the series.

In the ''[[Umineko no naku koro ni]]'' visual novels, Rudolf Ushiromiya's wife Asumu and mistress/later second wife Kyrie were pregnant and gave birth at roughly the same time. Rudolf had the children switched when Asumu's child was stillborn so the affair wouldn't be uncovered, and after Asumu's death from an illness, he married Kyrie. The surviving child grows into the protagonist of the games, Battler Ushiromiya, who believes himself to be Asumu and Rudolf's son until later in the story.

In the game ''[[Tales of the Abyss]]'', Princess Natalia Luzu Kimlasca-Lanvaldear died few after birth so her nanny Maggie switched her with her also newborn granddaughter, Meryl Oakland. This causes Meryl's mother Sylvia (Maggie's own daughter) to commit suicide out of grief, and her father Badaq soon became the enemy general Largo the Black Lion. Meryl, now Natalia, is raised as the Princess and doesn't find out the truth until she's a teenager.

==In reality==

In real life, such a switch occurs rarely.&lt;ref name=Merish /&gt; Since many cases of babies switched at birth are likely undocumented or unknown, the following is presumably not an exhaustive list.

*In 1931, at the [[Leiden University Medical Center]], female babies Agnes van Vegten and Lenie van Duyn were switched. Suspicions did not rise until two decades later, when the girls met at a wedding and wondered at their mutual likeness to each other's family.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters (1955, December 28). "CHANGELING" SUES PARENTS :Dutch Case Ruled Inadmissible. The Manchester Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1951, at a hospital in [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]], the babies of Mary Miller and Kay McDonald were accidentally switched. Mary Miller immediately suspected that a switch had occurred, as the baby she received weighed a full two pounds less than at the hospital. Mary Miller knew Kay McDonald, and assumed that it was their baby she had taken home.  However, a series of circumstances kept Mary Miller from actively pursuing her suspicion for 43 years, when she revealed to the now grown girls, Sue McDonald and Martha Miller, what she suspected of their births. Genetic tests later confirmed that a switch did in fact occur. The story was featured on an episode of the radio show ''[[This American Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1496358/public_radio_to_air_story_of_pdc_babies_switched_at/ View - redOrbit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1253 2011 | Archive | This American Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1953, at Pioneer Memorial Hospital in [[Heppner, Oregon]], two babies were switched. In May 2009, the women discovered they were switched. DeeAnn Angell of Fossil and Kay Rene Reed of Condon learned about the mistake from an 86-year-old woman who was a former neighbor. The former neighbor said that one of the girls' mothers, Marjorie Angell, insisted back in 1953 that she had been given the wrong baby after nurses returned from bathing them. But her concerns were ignored. With both sets of parents dead, the Reed and Angell siblings compared notes and family stories, learning that rumors of a mix-up had been around for years. Kay Rene Reed decided to get their DNA tested, and that confirmed the mistake. They both say they just have to move forward with their lives now, and they celebrated their latest birthday together.
*In March 1953, at San-Ikukai Hospital in Tokyo's Sumida Ward, hospital staff mistook a baby boy for another baby boy born 13 minutes later. This story was referred to as the tale of the Japanese "prince and pauper." Sixty years later, a 60-year-old Japanese truck driver discovered he was switched at birth after being born to a rich family. The man was raised by a single mother in a 100-square-foot apartment. The boy who was raised in his place by the rich family became the president of a real estate company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/11/29/247807768/japanese-prince-switched-at-birth-was-raised-a-pauper | title=Japanese 'Prince' Switched At Birth Was Raised A Pauper | publisher=NPR| date=Nov 29, 2013 | accessdate=15 July 2014 | author=Calamur, Krishnadev}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Man born to wealthy parents lived in poverty after being switched at birth|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc1tOM6Qn5Y|website=YouTube|publisher=Global Report News|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Kimberly Mays and Arlena Twigg were switched at birth as a result of a [[medical error]] in a hospital in [[Wauchula, Florida]];&lt;ref name=Guggenheim&gt;{{cite book|title=What's Wrong With Children's Rights?|author=Martin Guggenheim|page=56|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-01721-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the events surrounding their case were subsequently dramatized as the made-for-TV movie ''[[Switched at Birth (film)|Switched at Birth]]''.
*In 1975, at least two known cases occurred in [[Norway House]], [[Manitoba]] of babies being switched at birth at the Norway House Hospital: Luke Monias and Norman Barkman,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-men-switched-at-birth-1.3317638 "2 Manitoba men switched at birth dealing with 'stolen identity'"]. [[CBC Manitoba]], November 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and Leon Swanson and David Tait Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/switched-birth-first-nation-hospital-manitoba-1.3736933 "Manitoba men weep after learning they were switched at birth 41 years ago"]. [[CBC Manitoba]], August 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Both pairs of boys were from the same small communities, and had been lifelong friends of their switch-mates before learning of the switches only in the mid-2010s.
*The Mixed-Up Brothers of [[Bogotá]] refers to two sets of [[identical twins]] that got separated at birth in 1988 and were raised as [[nonidentical twins]]. The twins reunited in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=DOMINUS|first1=SUSAN|title=The Mixed-Up Brothers of Bogotá|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/magazine/the-mixed-up-brothers-of-bogota.html|accessdate=31 August 2016|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chai|first1=Carmen|title=Watch: A tale of two sets of identical twins, mixed up at birth|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2117243/watch-a-tale-of-two-sets-of-identical-twins-mixed-up-at-birth/|accessdate=31 August 2016|work=Global News|publisher=Global News|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Where are the 'Mixed up brothers of Bogota' now?|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4432849113001/where-are-the-mixed-up-brothers-of-bogota-now/?#sp=show-clips|accessdate=31 August 2016|work=Fox News|date=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mixed-Up Brothers of Bogotá|url=http://imgur.com/gallery/bIo6A|website=imgur|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The sons of two [[South Africa]]n women, Margaret Clinton-Parker and Sandra Dawkins, were accidentally switched at birth in 1989; the women sued in the [[High Court of South Africa]] in [[Johannesburg]] in 1995, demanding damages of [[South African rand|ZAR]]120,000 each from the government of the province of [[Gauteng]] for the error.&lt;ref name ="old"&gt;''Clinton-Parker v. Administrator, Transvaal''; ''Dawkins v. Administrator, Transvaal'' 1996 (2) SA 37 (W)&lt;/ref&gt; They were later that year awarded damages to cover medical expenses and the future projected costs of visiting their biological children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Deseret News]]|date=1995-08-22|title=2 MOMS SUING OVER SONS SWITCHED AT BIRTH|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/DSNB/lib00497,0F360DC14A813699.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Damages awarded after babies switched|work=[[The Kansas City Star]]|date=1995-10-22|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/KC/lib00144,0EAF4234676AD331.html|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each family kept the child they had been living with, though, and raised them as their own even after learning of the switch. That was until one of the boys, Robin, at the age of 15, decided to leave Sandy Dawkins to go and live with his biological mother, Margaret Clinton-Parker. The boys spent the remainder of their childhood living as brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=267887 Switched at birth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1992, it was discovered that Canadians Brent Tremblay and Marcus Holmes had been switched at birth 21 years earlier. The error was discovered when Brent and his twin, George Holmes, met each other at Carleton University in Ottawa.  The Children's Aid Society of Ontario later settled with the families involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/switched.asp snopes.com: Twins Switched at Birth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1998, it was discovered that Callie Johnson and Rebecca Chittum had been switched at birth in 1995 in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. The switch was discovered when a DNA test of Callie Johnson to determine paternity for [[child support]] found that she was not biologically related to either her purported father, Carlton Conley, or her purported mother, Paula Johnson. In a tragic coincidence, Callie's biological parents Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers died in a car accident the day after Paula Johnson learned of the results of the DNA test. Five others also died in the car accident, but Rebecca Chittum, Johnson's three-year-old biological daughter whom the deceased couple had been raising as their child, was at home with her supposed grandparents at the time of the accident. Over the next decade, Paula Johnson repeatedly grappled with Rebecca's purported grandparents for custody and visitation rights, until a judge determined that the two girls were old enough to express their own wishes with regard to seeing their biological relatives. In 2001, Carlton Conley married the sister of his biological daughter Rebecca's deceased adoptive father Kevin Chittum. Rebecca Chittum lived with the couple as of 2008 but had limited contact with her biological mother, while Callie lived with Paula Johnson and occasionally visited her biological relatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/168155 Two families, 10 years later - Roanoke.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2001, it was reported that a 35-year-old woman from the [[Canary Islands]] had discovered that she was one of a set of [[identical twins]] and that she had been accidentally switched at birth with another girl. She grew up as an only child, until a friend of her twin mistook her for being that twin. But the person was shocked by the striking similarity in appearance and summoned them together. They took a DNA test, which proved they were identical twins. The twin who had grown up thinking that another girl was her twin said that the girl she thought was her twin looked nothing like her. Since the women were born in a state hospital, they sued the government for damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7422635.stm | work=BBC News | title=Spain twins sue over birth mix-up | date=May 27, 2008 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On December 9, 2006, two newborn girls were switched in a hospital in the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] town of Trebic. The families did not find out until September 2007, when a couple of friends of one of the fathers made fun of him for not being the biological father of the baby. DNA tests proved that the girl was indeed switched. After days of investigation, the other family was found. The babies were gradually introduced to their biological parents and returned to their birth homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://czechdaily.wordpress.com/2009/01/30/babies-switched-at-birth-verdict-hospital-to-pay-33m// Switched At Birth Verdict: Hospital to Pay « The Czech Daily Word&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On October 10, 2011, it was discovered that two [[Russia]]n newborn girls were switched 12 years beforehand in a town in the [[Ural Mountains]]. The truth emerged after the ex-husband of one of the mothers refused to pay alimony for the child on the basis that she looked nothing like him. DNA tests proved that the child was neither's biological daughter. The other family was discovered across town with the biological daughter. The children will stay with their adoptive parents, and both families are demanding 5 million [[rubles]] in damage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15244382 Russian families sue child mix-up hospital ]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Moses Cushworth, the son of U.K. citizen Rich Cushworth and his Salvadoran wife Mercedes "Mercy" Casanalles, was switched with another baby at a Salvadoran hospital in May 2015. Getting Moses out of El Salvador became a nine-month process requiring the help of U.K. Ambassador [[Bernhard Garside]] in obtaining a passport for the boy, due to the problems with the birth certificate.

==Anti-switch techniques==
Some hospitals take fingerprints, foot prints, or palm prints of newborns to prevent babies from being mixed up.  Nurses also double check with the mother, checking the identity of that person as well, in order to prevent errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Obstetrics for Nurses|author=Joseph Bolivar De Lee|publisher=W. B. Saunders|location=London and Philadelphia|year=1966|page=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Childhood and Adolescence: A Psychology of the Growing Person|author=Lawrence Joseph Stone and Joseph Church|year=1973|publisher=Random House UK Ltd|isbn=0-394-31723-8|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many hospitals also have policies in which a medical record number is assigned to an infant at birth, and bands with this number as well as the last name of the mother of the infant, the sex of the infant, and the date and time of birth are placed on the infant and the mother immediately after [[parturition]] before the mother and child are separated.  A band may also be placed on the father (or other person chosen by the mother) at the time of birth.

The '''Boboli Gardens''' ({{lang-it|Giardino di Boboli}}) is a park in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], that is home to a collection of sculptures dating from the 16th through the 18th centuries, with some Roman antiquities.

==History and layout==
[[File:Boboli-gardens-from-palazzo.jpg|thumb|Boboli Gardens Amphitheatre, viewed from the Palazzo Pitti]]
The Gardens, directly behind the [[Pitti Palace]], the main seat of the [[Medici]] grand dukes of [[Tuscany]] at [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], are some of the first and most familiar formal 16th-century Italian gardens. The mid-16th-century garden style, as it was developed here, incorporated longer axial developments, wide gravel avenues, a considerable "built" element of stone, the lavish employment of statuary and fountains, and a proliferation of detail, coordinated in semi-private and public spaces that were informed by classical accents: [[grotto]]s, [[nympheum]]s, garden temples and the like. The openness of the garden, with an expansive view of the city, was unconventional for its time. The gardens were very lavish, considering no access was allowed to anyone outside the immediate Medici family, and no entertainment or parties ever took place in the gardens.

The Boboli Gardens were laid out for [[Eleonora di Toledo]], the wife of [[Cosimo I de' Medici]].&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite book | year=2007 | title=Boboli Gardens | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is a corruption of "Bogoli", a family from whom land had been bought to construct the garden.&lt;ref name="Hibbert2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbert|first=Christopher|title=The Rise and Fall of the House of Medici|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzV9uDSjjEcC|accessdate=28 December 2015|date=1979|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780141927145|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage was scarcely begun by [[Niccolò Tribolo]]&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; before he died in 1550, then was continued by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]], with contributions in planning from [[Giorgio Vasari]], who laid out the grottos, and in sculpture by [[Bernardo Buontalenti]].&lt;ref name=zucconi&gt;{{cite book | first=Guido | last=Zucconi | year=1995 | title=Florence: An Architectural Guide | edition=2001 Reprint | publisher=Arsenale Editrice | location=San Giovanni Lupatoto (Vr) | ISBN=| pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elaborate architecture of the grotto in the courtyard that separates the palace from its garden is by Buontalenti.

The garden lacks a natural water source.  To water the plants in the garden, a conduit was built from the nearby [[Arno River]] to feed water into an elaborate irrigation system.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

The primary axis, centered on the rear façade of the palace, rises on Boboli Hill from a deep [[amphitheater]]&lt;ref name=zucconi/&gt; that is reminiscent in its shape of one half of a classical [[hippodrome]] or racecourse. At the center of the amphitheater and rather dwarfed by its position is the [[Ancient Egyptian]] [[Boboli obelisk]]&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; brought from the [[Villa Medici]] at Rome. This primary axis terminates in a fountain of [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] (known to the irreverent Florentines as the "Fountain of the Fork" for Neptune's trident), with the sculpture of Neptune by [[Stoldo Lorenzi]] visible against the skyline as a visitor climbs the slope.

[[Giulio Parigi]] laid out the long secondary axis, the ''Viottolone'' or ''Cyprus Road'' at a right angle to the primary axis. This road led up through a series of terraces and water features, the main one being the Isolotto complex, with the [[bosquet]]s on either side, and then allowed for exit from the gardens almost at Porta Romana, which was one of the main gates of the walled city. In 1617, Parigi constructed the ''Grotto of Vulcan'' (''Grotticina di Vulcano'') along this axis.

The gardens have passed through several stages of enlargement and restructuring work. They were enlarged in the 17th century to their present extent of 45,000&amp;nbsp;meters² (111&amp;nbsp;acres).&lt;ref name=zucconi/&gt; The Boboli Gardens have come to form an outdoor museum of garden sculpture that includes Roman antiquities as well as 16th and 17th century works.

In the first phase of building, the amphitheatre was excavated in the hillside behind the palace. Initially formed by clipped edges and greens, it was later formalized by rebuilding in stone decorated with statues based on Roman myths such as the Fountain of the Ocean sculpted by [[Giambologna]], then transferred to another location within the same garden. The small Grotto of Madama, and the Large Grotto, were begun by Vasari and completed by Ammannati and Buontalenti between 1583 and 1593.&lt;ref name=zucconi/&gt;

Even while undergoing restoration work in 2015, the Large Grotto's statues are still on display and represent defining examples of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] sculpture and architecture. Decorated internally and externally with stalactites and originally equipped with waterworks and luxuriant vegetation, the fountain is divided into three main sections. The first one was frescoed to create the illusion of a natural grotto, that is a natural refuge to allow shepherds to protect themselves from wild animals; it originally housed ''The Prisoners'' of [[Michelangelo]] (now replaced by copies), statues that were first intended for the tomb of the [[Pope Julius II]]. Other rooms in the Grotto contain [[Giambologna|Giambologna's]] famous ''Bathing Venus'' and an 18th-century group of ''Paris and Helen'' by [[Vincenzo de' Rossi]].

==The Fountain of Neptune==
In the hillside above the amphitheatre is a double ramp, leading to the ''Fountain of Neptune''. The main feature is a large basin with a central bronze statue of ''Neptune'' (1565-1568) by [[Stoldo Lorenzi]]. This fountain was being constructed contemporaneously with it more famous counterpart, [[Bartolomeo Ammannati|Ammannati's]] ''[[Fountain of Neptune, Florence|Fountain of Neptune]]'' at the corner of the Palazzo Vecchio at the Piazza della Signoria in the center of Florence. The conceit here recalls the story of the competition of Athena and Neptune to be patrons of Athens. In that legend, Neptune struck the ground with his trident to spring forth water from the land. Higher up on the hillside is a statue of ''Abundance'' (''Dovizia'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LYoXoEQyOF0C The Italian Garden: Art, Design and Culture], article : Hard times in Baroque Florence: The Boboli Garden and the grand ducal public works administration, by Malcolm Campbell, editor: John Dixon Hunt, page 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Isolotto==
[[File:Boboli, isolotto, andromeda 02.JPG|thumb|Andromeda rises above the ''Isolotto'' centered in its pool: the luxuriant and naturalistic plant growth is a 19th-century development.]]
The Isolotto is an oval-shaped island in a tree enclosed pond nearly at the end of the alternative Viottolone axis. In the centre of the island is the Fountain of the Ocean, while in the surrounding moat, there are statues of Perseus and Andromedae (school of [[Giambologna]]). The Isolotto was laid out (circa 1618) by Giulio and Alfonso Parigi.

===Viscri===
Viscri's population is of [[Roma in Romania|Roma]] majority, with a few [[Romanians]], and about 20 Germans. It lies northwest of [[Rupea]] and can be reached through [[Jibert|Dacia]] on a 7&amp;nbsp;km unpaved road. The village is best known for the highly fortified [[Viscri fortified church]], originally built around 1100. It is part of the [[Saxon villages with fortified churches in Transylvania|villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]], designated in 1993 as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]. The first documentation of Viscri is a record of church taxes dated around 1400, in which the village is referred to as being part of the Rupea parish. Its inhabitants consisted of 51 farmers, 1 school master, 3 shepherds and 2 paupers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mihaieminescutrust.org/content/nd_village.asp?n=102# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018211031/http://www.mihaieminescutrust.org/content/nd_village.asp?n=102# |archive-date=2008-10-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the fortified church date from 1100 when the [[Székelys]] built a small church with a single hall and semicircular [[apse]]. Around 1185 the church was taken over by Saxon colonists, and the Székelys were forced to settle further north. In the 14th century the eastern part of the church was rebuilt and in 1525, the first fortifications with towers were added. In the 18th century the church was surrounded by a second defense wall. After 1743 a covered corridor for the storage of corn was built.  A century later, two chambers in the defense corridor of the bastion were turned into school rooms. The classic 19th-century altar has as centerpiece "the Blessing of the Children" by the painter J. Paukratz from Rupea. The font was made from a capital of the 13th-century church. To this day, the church is surrounded by a cemetery with gravestones dating back to the "[[Bijelo Brdo culture]]".

In 2006, The [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] bought and restored two 18th century Saxon houses in the Transylvanian villages of [[Mălâncrav]] and Viscri to help protect the unique way of life that has existed for hundreds of years and promote sustainable tourism. The buildings have been sensitively restored and converted into guesthouses for tourists. They remain in keeping with the surrounding architecture and feature a number of Transylvanian antiques but with modern facilities where possible. The renovation of these buildings has helped provide a sustainable future for the people of rural Transylvania while also enabling residents to maintain their traditional way of life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/newsandgallery/focus/the_prince_of_wales_s_properties_in_romania_1484339285.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cardiff School of Art &amp; Design''' (CSAD) is one of the five schools that comprise [[Cardiff Metropolitan University]]. It originated as the Cardiff School of Art in 1865.

==History==
Cardiff School of Art &amp; Design opened in 1865 as the Cardiff School of Science &amp; Art&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiffmet.ac.uk/alumni/Pages/Our-History.aspx |title=The History of Cardiff Metropolitan University  |publisher=CMU |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with lessons initially taking place on the top floor of the Cardiff Free Library and Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SScGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22Milo+ap+Griffith%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TrNoVPnyFNPhaIeHgPgH&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Milo%20ap%20Griffith%22&amp;f=false |title=Sixth Annual Report 1867&amp;ndash;68 |publisher=Cardiff Free Library and Museum and Science and Art Schools |date=1868 |page=7 |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867 a distinct School of Art was formed, based on the Art Night School, with 65 young pupils aged between 9 and 17. In 1868 an older intake was accepted, of 50 'artisan' students between 17 and 25 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SScGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22Milo+ap+Griffith%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TrNoVPnyFNPhaIeHgPgH&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Milo%20ap%20Griffith%22&amp;f=false |title=Sixth Annual Report 1867&amp;ndash;68 |chapter=The Headmaster's Report |publisher=Cardiff Free Library and Museum and Science and Art Schools |date=1868 |pages=13–14 |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, a new six-storey campus was built in Howard Gardens, Cardiff, with large studios facing north. The building was designed by the Cardiff City Architect, John Dryburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Newman |first1=John |title=The Buildings of Wales: Glamorgan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpUMspCtpNIC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=%22Howard+gardens%22+gallery+cardiff&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NhfLUs34K8yh7AbS4oAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Howard%20gardens%22%20gallery%20cardiff&amp;f=false |place= |publisher=Penguin Books |page=306 |year=2001 |isbn=0-14-071056-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School merged with other colleges in 1976 to become part of South Glamorgan Institute of Higher Education (later Cardiff Institute of Higher Education and the University of Wales Institute Cardiff).&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; It is the oldest constituent part of Cardiff Metropolitan University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/into-university/az-uni-colleges/cardiff-university-of-wales-institute-458889.html |title=

In 2013, Cardiff Metropolitan University put its 2.25 acre Howard Gardens campus up for sale with the intention of moving to a new site in summer 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sion Barry |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/commercial-property/cardiff-metropolitan-university-puts-howard-6280232 |title=

==About CSAD==
Cardiff School of Art &amp; Design was assessed as one of the top 40 destinations to study art and design in the UK by guardian.co.uk in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2010/jun/04/university-guide-art-and-design ''Guardian'' League Tables]&lt;/ref&gt;

CSAD has thirteen 'Subject' areas:  Animation, Architectural Studies, Ceramics, Fashion Design, Fine Art, Graphic Communication, Illustration, Interior Design, International Design, Photographic Practice, Product Design, Textiles and an ideas, histories and theories subject area called Constellation. 

All of its 'Subjects' can be studied at undergraduate, (BA/BSc) postgraduate (MA/MDes/MFA/MSc) and at research degree level (PhD) or Professional Doctorate (PDoc). 

CSAD has a number of partner colleges who deliver its Art &amp; Design Foundation Diploma, HNCs, Foundation Degrees and a further BA on its behalf as well as close links with Ffotogallery, Cardiff and Cardiff University Medical School. It has research affiliations and study exchange agreements with numerous other UK, EU and International Universities. 

CSAD is affiliated with the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]], [[European University Association]], and [[University Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4icu.org/reviews/4822.htm|title=University of Wales Institute, Cardiff|publisher=4International Colleges and Universities|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The school's Art and Design research is conducted through the [[WIRAD|Wales Institute for Research in Art and Design (WIRAD)]]. In the 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] the Art &amp; Design panel rated 95% of the research submission as international standard, with 70% rated as either Internationally Excellent or World Leading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csad.uwic.ac.uk/csad/research.htm Research areas &amp; RAE assessment results]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is home to a number of highly regarded international standard research groups which range across the humanities, art, design and sciences as well as the Centre for [[Ceramic]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artcolleges/InfoAll/introduction/ac_id/62|title=Introduction - Cardiff School of Art and Design|publisher=saatchi-gallery.co.uk|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cardiff Open Art School==
The Cardiff Open Art School (COAS) is part of the School, and runs classes in [[photography]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[life drawing]], [[printmaking]] and several other disciplines for part-time students in the Cardiff area in particular through the School's relationship with FFotogallery, Cardiff.

==Awards==
In June 2010, the CSAD Summer Degree Show was voted the best in the UK for painting by ''Artists and Illustrators'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistsandillustrators.co.uk/ June 2010 issue]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, CSAD won both a HEIST bronze award and a best publication award at the Association of Commonwealth Universities Annual Marketing and Communications awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.uwic.ac.uk/English/News/Pages/180509award.aspx Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705192601/http://www3.uwic.ac.uk/English/News/Pages/180509award.aspx |date=5 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Partnerships==

==History==

[[File:Chapter Arts in Cardiff.jpg|thumb|right|Image taken in 2006, prior to the redevelopment]] 

Chapter was founded by Welsh artists, [[Christine Kinsey]] and Bryan Jones with journalist Mike Flood and opened in 1971.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[http://www.chapter.org/history.html A Brief History of Chapter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003184935/http://www.chapter.org/history.html |date=3 October 2011 }}, Chapter Arts Centre website. Retrieved 2011-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The building was previously a school, Canton High School, and was built in 1905.&lt;ref name="AJ2010"&gt;Rory Olcayto [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/buildings/culture/chapter-arts-centre-cardiff-by-ash-sakula-architects/5215220.article ''Chapter Arts Centre, Cardiff, by Ash Sakula Architects''], The Architects' Journal, 11 March 2010. Retrieved 2011-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently Chapter underwent a £3.8 million redevelopment, designed by architects [[Ash Sakula Architects]], who were appointed in 2006. The practice prioritised remodelling of the public areas on the ground floor, while adding a storey-high 'light box' above the main entrance as an 'artistic billboard'.&lt;ref name="AJ2010" /&gt; The centre remained open through the redevelopment and the new Chapter opened in November 2009. The building won a [[Royal Institute of British Architects|R.I.B.A.]] Wales Award in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/RegionsAndInternational/UKNationsAndRegions/Wales/Awards/RIBA%20Awards.aspx RIBA Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310122544/http://www.architecture.com/RegionsAndInternational/UKNationsAndRegions/Wales/Awards/RIBA%20Awards.aspx |date=10 March 2012 }}, R.I.B.A. website. Retrieved 2011-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The new open-plan design was described as user friendly with many great details.&lt;ref name="AJ2010" /&gt; 

Following the Centre's refurbishment in 2009, the number of visitors doubled to 800,000 per year, making it the second most popular attraction in Cardiff.&lt;ref name="Unveils plans"&gt;Cathy Owen (11 April 2014) [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/chapter-arts-centre-unveils-plans-6949419 "Chapter Arts Centre unveils plans for £6m expansion"], ''WalesOnline''. Retrieved 2014-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of March 2014 Chapter installed 60 photovoltaic [[Solar cells|solar panels]] to their roof providing up to 15KW of electricity. {{cn|date=April 2014}}

In the autumn of 2014 Chapter became a venue for the international [[Artes Mundi]] exhibition and art prize, which expanded for the first time beyond the [[National Museum Cardiff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Emma Crichton-Miller |title=Artes Mundi: international art in Cardiff |work=Apollo Magazine |date=13 November 2014 |url=http://www.apollo-magazine.com/artes-mundi-international-art-cardiff/ |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015 Chapter announced that the main Theatre and Stiwdio spaces would be renamed to celebrate a significant donation from [http://www.aandbcymru.org.uk/david-and-philippa-seligman/ David Seligman]. The spaces will be known as Theatr Seligman Theatre and Stiwdio Seligman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chapter celebrates significant donation from David Seligman|url = http://www.chapter.org/news-noise/news/chapter-celebrates-significant-donation-david-seligman|website = Chapter|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cirebon Mask Dance''' or ''tari topeng Cirebon'' is a local indigenous art form of [[Cirebon]] in Java, including [[Indramayu]] and [[Jatibarang, Indramayu|Jatibarang]], [[West Java]] and [[Brebes]], [[Central Java]]. It is called mask dance because the dancers use masks when dancing. There is a lot of variety in Javanese mask dance, both in terms of the dance style and the stories to be conveyed. Sometimes the mask dance can be performed by solo dancers, or it can also be performed by several people.

Graceful hand and body movements, and musical accompaniment dominated by drums and fiddle, are hallmarks of  Javanese mask dance.
The dance is performed on special occasions for local officials, or for other traditional celebrations.

The one of mask dance maestro is [[Mimi Rasinah]], an active dancer and teaches studio art at the ''Tari Topeng Mimi Rasinah'' located in the village Pekandangan, Indramayu . Since 2006, Mimi Rasinah suffering from paralysis, but she was still excited to performing, dancing and teaching mask dance until the end of her life, Mimi Rasinah died in August 2010 at the age of 80.

'''Creativity''' is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an [[idea]], a [[scientific theory]], a [[musical composition]], or a [[joke]]) or a physical object (such as an [[invention]], a [[Literature|literary work]], or a [[painting]]).

Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily [[psychology]], [[business studies]], and [[cognitive science]], but also [[education]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]] (particularly [[philosophy of science]]), [[theology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]],  and [[economics]], covering  the relations between creativity and general [[intelligence]], personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or [[artificial intelligence]]; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.

== Etymology ==
The [[lexeme]] in the English word ''creativity'' comes from the [[Latin]] term ''creō'' "to create, make": its [[Morphological derivation|derivational suffixes]] also come from Latin. The word "create" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Runco|first=Mark A.|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9|author2=Albert, Robert S.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Creativity Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[The Parson's Tale]]&lt;ref&gt;"And eke Job saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath '''created''' all things in right order, and nothing without order, but all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that be damned be not in order, nor hold no order."&lt;/ref&gt;). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=RuncoAlbert /&gt;

== Definition ==
In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: "Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" (Mumford, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;110),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mumford | first1 = M. D. | year = 2003 | title = Where have we been, where are we going? Taking stock in creativity research | url = | journal = [[Creativity Research Journal]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2–3| pages = 107–120 | doi=10.1080/10400419.2003.9651403}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in [[Robert Sternberg]]'s words, the production of "something original and worthwhile".&lt;ref name="Sternberg Cognitive Psychology 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sternberg|first1=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-38701-5|page=479|edition=6|chapter=Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature.&lt;ref name="Meusburger1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meusburger|first=Peter|title=Milieus of Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Spatiality of Creativity|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9876-5 |editor=Meusburger, P. |editor2=Funke, J. |editor3=Wunder, E.|chapter=Milieus of Creativity: The Role of Places, Environments and Spatial Contexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an illustration, one definition given by [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Dr. E. Paul Torrance]] described it as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."&lt;ref name="Torrance Test Manual Verbal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrance|first1=Paul|title=The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Norms-Technical Manual Research Edition|publisher=Personnel Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=6|chapter=Verbal Tests. Forms A and B-Figural Tests, Forms A and B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects ==
Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as "the four Ps" — process, product, person, and place (according to [[James Melvin Rhodes|Mel Rhodes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mel Rhodes: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20342603?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103750220081''An Analysis of Creativity.''] in Phi Delta Kappan 1961, Vol. 42,  No. 7, p. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; A focus on ''process'' is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as [[J. P. Guilford|Guilford]]), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative ''product'' usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful [[memetics|memes]].&lt;ref name="Gabora"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Liane Gabora|Gabora, Liane]]|year=1997|title= The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity|journal=Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|volume=1|url=http://cogprints.org/794/1/oecc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=CENGAGE Learning|isbn=978-0-495-50629-4|page=468|editor=Jaime A. Perkins |editor2=Dan Moneypenny |editor3=Wilson Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A focus on the nature of the creative ''person'' considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of [[Ideation (creative process)|ideation]], autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on ''place'' considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468" /&gt;

== History of the concept ==
{{Main|History of the concept of creativity}}
[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity, preferring to see art as a form of discovery. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", Plato answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244"&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Ancient views ===
Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of [[Ancient Greece]],&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt; [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Outline of ancient India|Ancient India]],&lt;ref name="Albert99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "''poiein''" ("to make"), which only applied to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who made it. [[Plato]] did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, The Republic, Book X – [[wikisource:The Republic/Book X]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt;

It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in [[Western culture]] through [[Christianity]], as a matter of [[Revelation|divine inspiration]].&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; According to the historian [[Daniel J. Boorstin]], "the early Western conception of creativity was the [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical story of creation]] given in the ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]''."&lt;ref name="Albert2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the [[Renaissance]]. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0091265|last=Niu|first=Weihua|author2=Sternberg, Robert J.|title=The Philosophical Roots of Western and Eastern Conceptions of Creativity|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|year=2006|volume=26|pages=18–38|url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/641OBVx0d?url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=}}; cf. [[Michel Weber]], "[https://www.academia.edu/3640181/_Creativity_Efficacy_and_Vision_Ethics_and_Psychology_in_an_Open_Universe_2006_ Creativity, Efficacy and Vision: Ethics and Psychology in an Open Universe]," in Michel Weber and Pierfrancesco Basile (eds.), ''Subjectivity, Process, and Rationality'', Frankfurt/Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought XIV, 2006, pp. 263-281.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture, for instance, [[Muse]]s were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods.&lt;ref name="Dacey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dacey|first=John|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity, Vol. 1|year=1999|isbn=978-0-12-227076-5|editor=Mark A. Runco |editor2=Steven R. Pritzer|chapter=Concepts of Creativity: A history|publisher=[[Elsevier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative "[[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]" (Greek) or "[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Albert3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of "[[Great Man theory|great men]]".&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt;

=== The Enlightenment and after ===
The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the [[Renaissance]] and even later.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg" /&gt; The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the [[Renaissance]], when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named [[humanism]], which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Humanism - Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture {{!}} Exhibitions - Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/humanism.html|website = www.loc.gov|date = 1993-01-08|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this philosophy arose the [[Renaissance man]] (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leonardo da Vinci {{!}} Italian artist, engineer, and scientist|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt; By the 18th century and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], mention of creativity (notably in [[aesthetics]]), linked with the concept of [[imagination]], became more frequent.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz80"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tatarkiewicz, Władysław |authorlink=Władysław Tatarkiewicz |title=A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics |location=Translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], The Hague |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the writing of [[Thomas Hobbes]], imagination became a key element of human cognition;&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; [[William Duff (writer)|William Duff]] was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of [[genius]], typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt;

As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt; Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of [[Darwinism]]. In particular, they refer to the work of [[Francis Galton]], who through his [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1896) and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.

=== Twentieth century to the present day ===
The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as [[Graham Wallas]]&lt;ref name="Wallas26"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallas, G. |title=Art of Thought |year=1926 |authorlink=Graham Wallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Wertheimer]]. In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
:(i) ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way),
:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);
:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).
Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-stage.

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton&lt;ref name="Simonton99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simonton, D. K. |year=1999 |title=Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.

In 1927, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as ''[[Process and Reality]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|title=Process and reality : an essay in cosmology ; Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of Edinburgh during the session 1927–28|year=1978|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-934580-1|edition=Corrected}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Steven|title=Introduction: Whitehead Now|journal=Configurations|year=2005|volume=1|issue=13|pages=1–33}}. Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'' (Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008) and Ronny Desmet &amp; Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Les Éditions Chromatika, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox [[Psychology|psychological]] literature, is usually considered to have begun with [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the topic&lt;ref name="Sternberg99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sternberg, R. J. |author2=Lubart, T. I. |chapter=The Concept of Creativity: Prospects and Paradigms |editor=Sternberg, R. J. |title=Handbook of Creativity |year=1999 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |authorlink=Robert Sternberg |isbn=978-0-521-57285-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargreaves | first1 = H. L. | year = 1927 | title = The faculty of imagination: An enquiry concerning the existence of a general faculty, or group factor, of imagination | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = Monograph Supplement 3 | issue = | pages = 1–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.&lt;ref name="Kozbelt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozbelt|first=Aaron|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9 |author2=Beghetto, Ronald A. |author3=Runco, Mark A.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Theories of Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Four C" model ===
[[James C. Kaufman]] and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; ''mini-c'' ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights"), ''little-c'' (everyday problem solving and creative expression), ''Pro-C'' (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and ''Big-C'' (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.&lt;ref name="KaufBeg2009"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0013688|last=Kaufman|first=James C.|author2=Beghetto, Ronald A.|title=Beyond Big and Little: The Four C Model of Creativity|journal=[[Review of General Psychology]]|year=2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–12|authorlink=James C. Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.&lt;ref name=Kozbelt /&gt; [[Margaret Boden]] distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).&lt;ref name="Boden2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boden|first=Margaret|title=The Creative Mind: Myths And Mechanisms|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-297-82069-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson&lt;ref name="allourfutures"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Ken|title=All our futures: Creativity, culture, education|year=1998|publisher=National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education|url=http://sirkenrobinson.com/skr/pdf/allourfutures.pdf|accessdate=2 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016051449/http://sirkenrobinson.com/skr/pdf/allourfutures.pdf|archivedate=16 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Anna Craft&lt;ref name="Craft1" /&gt; have focused on creativity in a general population, particularly with respect to education. Craft makes a similar distinction between "high" and "little c" creativity.&lt;ref name="Craft1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Craft|first=Anna|title=Creativity in education|year=2001|publisher=Continuum International|isbn=978-0-8264-4863-7 |editor=Craft, A. |editor2=Jeffrey, B. |editor3=Leibling, M. |chapter='Little C' creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cites [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Ken Robinson]] as referring to "high" and "democratic" creativity. [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]&lt;ref name="Csik1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi |first=Mihály|title=Creativity:Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention|year=1996|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-092820-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.&lt;ref name="Simonton97"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.104.1.66|last=Simonton|first=D. K.|title=Creative Productivity: A Predictive and Explanatory Model of Career Trajectories and Landmarks|journal=Psychological Review|year=1997|volume=104|issue=1|pages=66–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories of creative processes ==
There has been much empirical study in [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]] of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.

=== Incubation ===
Incubation is a temporary break from [[creative problem solving]] that can result in insight.&lt;ref name="EoC Incubation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=S. M.|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity Volume I|year=2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-375039-6|pages=653–657|edition=2nd|editor=M. A. Runco |editor2=S. R. Pritzker|chapter=Incubation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of "incubation" in [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward&lt;ref name="Ward2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ward, T. |year=2003 |chapter=Creativity |editor= Nagel, L. |title=Encyclopaedia of Cognition |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some [[empirical evidence]] is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables "forgetting" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become [[fixation (psychology)|fixated]] on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.&lt;ref name="Smith1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Steven M.|title=The Creative Cognition Approach|year=1995|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|editor=Steven M. Smith |editor2=Thomas B. Ward |editor3=Ronald A. Finke|chapter=Fixation, Incubation, and Insight in Memory and Creative Thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.&lt;ref name=Anderson2000&gt;"{{cite book |author=Anderson, J. R. |year=2000 |title=Cognitive psychology and its implications |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-1686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This earlier hypothesis is discussed in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]'s five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly (1996). ''Creativity : Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention.'' New York: Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-092820-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergent and divergent thinking ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]&lt;ref name="Guilford67"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guilford, J. P. |year=1967 |title=The Nature of Human Intelligence |authorlink=J. P. Guilford}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed [[convergent thinking|convergent]] and [[divergent thinking]]). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Creative cognition approach ===
In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the "Geneplore" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts.&lt;ref name="Ward1995"&gt;Ward, T.B. (1995). What’s old about new ideas. In S. M. Smith, T. B. Ward &amp; R. A. &amp; Finke (Eds.) ''The creative cognition approach'', 157–178, London: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisberg&lt;ref name="Weisberg93"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weisberg, R. W. |year=1993 |title=Creativity: Beyond the myth of genius |publisher=Freeman |isbn=978-0-7167-2119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

=== The Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory ===
Helie and Sun&lt;ref name="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Helie S. |author2=Sun R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861|citeseerx=10.1.1.405.2245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recently proposed a unified framework for understanding [[creative problem-solving|creativity in problem solving]], namely the Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]]).

The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:
# The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; 
# The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;
# The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. 
A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION cognitive architecture]] and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.

=== Conceptual blending ===
{{Main|Conceptual blending}}
In ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' — that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.&lt;ref name="Koestler64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].

=== Honing theory ===
Honing theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.

A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.&lt;ref&gt;Gabora, L. &amp; Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20–23, 2011, Boston MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.

Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.

=== Everyday imaginative thought ===
In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think "if only...".&lt;ref&gt;Roese, N. J. &amp; Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, K. Klein, W. &amp; Suhr, E. (eds) (2009). ''Handbook of mental simulation and the human imagination.'' Hove, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth M. J. Byrne|Byrne, R. M. J.]] (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessing individual creative ability ==
=== Creativity quotient ===
There was a ''creativity quotient'' developed similar to the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ). It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Allan|date=2004|title=The creativity quotient: An objective scoring of ideational fluency|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=16|issue=4|pages=415–419|doi=10.1080/10400410409534552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychometric approach ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]'s group,&lt;ref name="Guilford67" /&gt; which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.
* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.
* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.
* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.
* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)
* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)

Building on Guilford's work, [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Torrance]]&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; developed the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://people.uncw.edu/caropresoe/GiftedFoundations/SocialEmotional/Creativity-articles/Kim_Can-we-trust-creativity-tests.pdf|title=Can We Trust Creativity Tests?|author=Kim, Kyung Hee|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
* '''Fluency''' – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.
* '''Originality''' – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.
* '''Elaboration''' – The amount of detail in the responses.

Such tests, sometimes called ''Divergent Thinking (DT)'' tests have been both supported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K.

Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of [[divergent thinking]] tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, [[Natural language processing|NLP]] techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E. A., &amp; Dunbar, K. N. (2009). Creativity evaluation through latent semantic analysis. In Proceedings of the 31st Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 602–607).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, I. J., &amp; Haarmann, H. (2014). Automated scoring of originality using semantic representations. In Proceedings of the 36th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (poster paper).&lt;/ref&gt; The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.

Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = S. | last2 = Runco | first2 = M.

=== Social-personality approach ===
Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.&lt;ref name="Sternberg99" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive." Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed.&lt;ref name=Feist /&gt; Within the framework of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged.&lt;ref name="Batey, M. 2006 p. 355-429"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Creativity, intelligence and personality: A critical review of the scattered literature | url = | journal = Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs | volume = 132 | issue = 4| pages = 355–429 | doi=10.3200/mono.132.4.355-430}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Openness to experience]] has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A.

Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, [[Conscientiousness|conscientious]], and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.&lt;ref name=Feist&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feist | first1 = G.

=== Self-report questionnaires ===
An alternative are biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications, patents, or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as [[Self-report study#Questionnaires and interviews|self-report questionnaires]] supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example, the [[Creativity Achievement Questionnaire|Creative Achievement Questionnaire]], a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.&lt;ref&gt;(Carson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the English original, it was also used in a Chinese,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ying-Yao|first=Wang, Chia-Chi{{!}}Ho, Hsiao-Chi{{!}}Cheng, Chih-Ling{{!}}Cheng|date=2014-00-00|title=Application of the Rasch Model to the Measurement of Creativity: The Creative Achievement Questionnaire.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1088863|journal=Creativity Research Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|issn=1040-0419}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendetowicz|first=David|last2=Urbanski|first2=Marika|last3=Aichelburg|first3=Clarisse|last4=Levy|first4=Richard|last5=Volle|first5=Emmanuelle|date=2017-01|title=Brain morphometry predicts individual creative potential and the ability to combine remote ideas|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010945216303161|journal=Cortex|volume=86|pages=216–229|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2016.10.021|pmid=27919546|issn=0010-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German-speaking&lt;ref name="Form 440–450"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|last2=Schlichting|first2=Kerrin|last3=Kaernbach|first3=Christian|date=2017-11|title=Mentoring functions: Interpersonal tensions are associated with mentees' creative achievement.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=440–450|doi=10.1037/aca0000103|issn=1931-390X}}&lt;/ref&gt; version.

== Creativity and intelligence ==
The potential relationship between creativity and [[intelligence]] has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels &amp; Jackson,&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962"&gt;Getzels, J. W., &amp; Jackson, P. W. (1962). Creativity and intelligence: Explorations with gifted students. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Barron,&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963"&gt;Barron, F. (1963). Creativity and psychological health. Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallach &amp; Kogan,&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965"&gt;Wallach, M. A., &amp; Kogan, N. (1965). Modes of thinking in young children: A study of the creativity-intelligence distinction. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; and Guilford&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967"&gt;Guilford, J. P. (1967). The nature of human intelligence. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; – focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why.&lt;ref&gt;Plucker, J., &amp; Renzulli, J. S. (1999). Psychometric approaches to the study of human creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 35–60). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:

*Threshold Theory – Intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120.&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967" /&gt;
*Certification Theory – Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work, which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative. Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, J. R. (1989). Cognitive processes in creativity. In J. A. Glover, R. R. Ronning, &amp; C. R. Reynolds (Eds.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 135–145). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interference Theory – Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996"&gt;Sternberg, R. J. (1996). Successful Intelligence. NewYork: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg and O’Hara&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; O’Hara, L. A. (1999). Creativity and intelligence. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 251–272). Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:
#Creativity is a subset of intelligence
#Intelligence is a subset of creativity
#Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs
#Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct (coincident sets)
#Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs (disjoint sets)

=== Creativity as a subset of intelligence ===
A number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence.

''Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence''

*Gardner’s  [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] (MIT)&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1993). Creating minds. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; – implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT. To demonstrate this, Gardner cited examples of different famous creators, each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e.g. Picasso (spatial intelligence); Freud (intrapersonal); Einstein (logical-mathematical); and Gandhi (interpersonal).
*Sternberg’s Theory of Successful intelligence&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J., Kaufman, J. C., &amp; Grigorenko, E. L. (2008). Applied intelligence. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Triarchic theory of intelligence]]) includes creativity as a main component, and comprises 3 sub-theories: Componential (Analytic), Contextual (Practical), and Experiential (Creative). Experiential sub-theory – the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems – is directly related to creativity.
*The [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory]] includes creativity as a subset of intelligence. Specifically, it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = S. B. | last3 = Lichtenberger | first3 = E. O. | year = 2011 | title = Finding creativity on intelligence tests via divergent production | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of School Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 83–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ideational fluency, associational fluency, and originality/creativity. Silvia et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silvia | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Beaty | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = E.

Martindale&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (1999). Biological bases of creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 137– 152). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.
*The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, J.C., Kaufman, S.B., &amp; Plucker, J.A. (2013). Contemporary theories of intelligence. In J. Reisberg (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Psychology (pp. 811-822). New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence. Type 1 is a conscious process, and concerns goal directed thoughts, which are explained by ''g''. Type 2 is an unconscious process, and concerns spontaneous cognition, which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type 1 and Type 2 processes working together in combination. The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.

=== Intelligence as a subset of creativity ===
In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.

''Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity''

*Sternberg &amp; Lubart’s Investment Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1991 | title = An investment theory of creativity and its development | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1–32 | doi=10.1159/000277029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1992 | title = Buy low and sell high: An investment approach to creativity | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 1–5 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.1992.tb00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the metaphor of a stock market, they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.
*Amabile’s Componential Model of Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T. M. | year = 1982 | title = Social psychology of creativity: A consensual assessment technique | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 997–1013 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1996). Creativity in context: Update to "The Social Psychology of Creativity". Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, there are 3 within-individual components needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation – and 1 component external to the individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.
*Amusement Park Theoretical Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baer | first1 = J. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2005 | title = Bridging generality and specificity: The Amusement Park Theoretical (APT) Model of creativity | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 158–163 | doi=10.1080/02783190509554310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this 4-step theory, both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:
**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.
**Secondly are the subcomponents – general thematic areas – that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).
**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.
**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.

=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===
This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.

''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''

*Renzulli’s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J. S. | year = 1978 | title = What makes giftedness? Reexamining a definition | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 180–261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions.
*[[PASS theory of intelligence]]. In this theory, the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Naglieri | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2001 | title = Understanding intelligence, giftedness, and creativity using PASS theory | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 151–156 | doi=10.1080/02783190109554087}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Threshold Theory (TT). A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak.&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, E. P. (1962). Guiding creative talent. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.

In support of the TT, Barron&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barron, F. (1969). Creative person and creative process. New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamamoto | first1 = K | year = 1964 | title = Creativity and sociometric choice among adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 249–261 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919564| pmid = 14238998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of ''r'' = .3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children. Fuchs-Beauchamp et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fuchs-Beauchamp | first1 = K. D. | last2 = Karnes | first2 = M. B. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = L.

Cho et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cho | first1 = S. H. | last2 = Nijenhuis | first2 = J. T. | last3 = van Vianen | first3 = N. E.

Jauk et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jauk | first1 = E. | last2 = Benedek | first2 = M. | last3 = Dunst | first3 = B. | last4 = Neubauer | first4 = A.

Much modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wai | first1 = J. | last2 = Lubinski | first2 = D. | last3 = Benbow | first3 = C. P. | year = 2005 | title = Creativity and occupational accomplishments among intellectually precocious youths: An age 13 to age 33 longitudinal study | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 3| pages = 484–492 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.97.3.484}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K. H. | year = 2005 | title = Can only intelligent people be creative? | url = | journal = Journal of Secondary Gifted Education | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 57–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Preckel | first1 = F. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | last3 = Wiese | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Relationship of intelligence and creativity in gifted and non-gifted students: An investigation of threshold theory | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 159–170 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of ''r'' = .3 to ''r'' = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.

=== Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets ===
Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind’s best work. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.

Weisberg &amp; Alba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = R. W. | last2 = Alba | first2 = J. W. | year = 1981 | title = An examination of the alleged role of "fixation" in the solution of several "insight" problems | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 110 | issue = 2| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1037/0096-3445.110.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see [[Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle]]) – where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.

=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===
In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.

Getzels and Jackson&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt; administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.

However, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNemar | first1 = O | year = 1964 | title = Lost: Our Intelligence? Why? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 871–882 | doi=10.1037/h0042008}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.

Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.

== Neuroscience ==
The [[neuroscience]] of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed&lt;ref name="NeuroPsychiatry"&gt;[http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf Kenneth M Heilman, MD, Stephen E. Nadeau, MD, and David Q. Beversdorf, MD. "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms" Neurocase (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319130652/http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the article "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms." The authors write that "creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected." Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,
* they are capable of [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].
* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.

Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.

This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147–53 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.&lt;ref name=PMID_26003860&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |laysummary = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232–9 |volume = 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===
Vandervert&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf &amp; Liu, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought&lt;ref&gt;Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 1997, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Korbo &amp; Pakkenberg, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; where creative and innovative thoughts arise.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2003a&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently, creative insight or the "aha" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber &amp; Kounios, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in "forward" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).&lt;ref&gt;Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka &amp; Kawato, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.

Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, in press-a&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2011, in press-b&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert &amp; Vandervert-Weathers, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive "mental prototyping" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al.

=== REM sleep ===
Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature02223 |author1=Wagner U. |author2=Gais S. |author3=Haider H. |author4=Verleger R. |author5=Born J. | year = 2004 | title = Sleep inspires insight | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6972| pages = 352–5 | pmid = 14737168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] rather than [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]] appears to be responsible.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0900271106 |author1=Cai D.

It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing "neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."&lt;ref name="Cai" /&gt;

== Affect ==
Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in [[voting behavior]], the term "affect" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Winkielman2007&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive affect relations ===
According to [[Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:
# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;
# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;
# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.

[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).

Various meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark A.

== Creativity and artificial intelligence ==
[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s formal [[theory]] of creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658| citeseerx = 10.1.1.474.6919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990–2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple [[Computational learning theory|computational]] principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model "wow-effects." This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present "wow-effect" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are "boring" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.

According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Video of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

Youtube, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, [[physicist]]s are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished [[physical law]]s permitting better [[data compression]]. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements.
Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for "inventing a novel joke with an unexpected [[punch line]], related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data."&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil AI: [http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-creative-machines-overtake-man Transcript] of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s TEDx talk (2012): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ35zNlyG-o&amp;list=PL194623EBA834DB77&amp;index=11 When creative machines overtake man]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Creativity and mental illness}}
A study by psychologist [[J. Philippe Rushton]] found creativity to correlate with [[intelligence]] and [[psychoticism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Rushton, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found creativity to be greater in [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] than in either normal or [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2005.06.016 |pmid=16125369 |url=http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |accessdate=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215212520/http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= |volume=80 |issue=2–3 |title=Verbal creativity and schizotypal personality in relation to prefrontal hemispheric laterality: A behavioral and near-infrared optical imaging study |year=2005 |journal=Schizophrenia Research |pages=271–282 | last1 = Folley | first1 = Bradley S. | last2 = Park | first2 = Sohee|pmc=2817946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and [[mood disorder]]s, particularly [[Bipolar disorder|manic-depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[bipolar disorder]]) and [[Major depressive disorder|depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, and [[artist]]s. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[Visual arts|visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]]. A different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and "creative bipolarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer Matthias|last2=Koutsoukou-Argyraki|first2=Asimina|date=2017|title=Bipolar Disorder and/or Creative Bipolarity: Robert Schumann's Exemplary Psychopathology - Combining Symptomatological and Psychosocial Perspectives with Creativity Research|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/479883|journal=Psychopathology|language=english|volume=50|issue=6|pages=379–388|doi=10.1159/000479883|pmid=29017153|issn=0254-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kyaga | first1 = S. | last2 = Lichtenstein | first2 = P. | last3 = Boman | first3 = M. | last4 = Hultman | first4 = C. | last5 = Långström | first5 = N. | last6 = Landén | first6 = M. | title = Creativity and mental disorder: Family study of 300 000 people with severe mental disorder | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.085316 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 199 | issue = 5 | pages = 373–379 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21653945| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another case study suggested a difference between severe mood disorders and "creative melancholy", pointing out mild and moderate depression may inspire creative achievements while severe depression inhibits and may even destroy creative activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer M.|last2=Roussel|first2=Martin|last3=Hofmann|first3=Frank-Hagen|date=2010-12|title=Depression and creativity — The case of the german poet, scientist and statesman J.

Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565"&gt;Roberts, Michelle. Creativity 'closely entwined with mental illness'. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19959565. 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565" /&gt;

According to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/01/creativity.aspx|title=The science of creativity|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creativity and personality ==
Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the four "Creativity Profiles" that can help achieve such goals.&lt;ref&gt;(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)
:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)
:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)
:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)

Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each

: (i) "Idea Generation" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)
: (ii) "Personality" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)
: (iii) "Motivation" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)
: (iv) "Confidence" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)

This model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;(Batey &amp; Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B. A. |author2=De Dreu C. K. | year = 2002 | title = Creativity and Group Innovation | url = | journal = Applied Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 400–406 | doi = 10.1111/1464-0597.00984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called ''divergent production''. ''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;(Guilford, 1950)&lt;/ref&gt; One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.

Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.&lt;ref&gt;(Christiaans &amp; Venselaar, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.

From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.&lt;ref&gt;(Campbell, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro &amp; Gardner, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.&lt;ref&gt;(Sternberg &amp; Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malevolent creativity ==
Malevolent creativity (MC) focuses on the "darker side" of creativity.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R. B. | year = 1993 | title = The dark side of creativity | url = | journal = Creat. Res. J. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 137–144 | doi = 10.1080/10400419309534472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated. MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. However, MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal.&lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hao | first1 = N | last2 = Tang | first2 = M | last3 = Yang | first3 = J | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q | last5 = Runco | first5 = MA | year = 2016 | title = A New Tool to Measure Malevolent Creativity: The Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 682 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00682 | pmid = 27242596 | pmc = 4870273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"/&gt; Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual’s expression of malevolent creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D.

The current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13 item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale (MCBS) &lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"/&gt;

===Malevolent creativity and crime===
Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.&lt;ref&gt;Aggression: A social psychological analysis.

== Creativity across cultures ==
Creativity is viewed differently in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg RJ 'Introduction' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (2006) (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 1-9. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cross-cultural research centred on [[Hong Kong]] found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society.&lt;ref&gt;Niu W (2006) 'Development of Creativity Research in Chinese Societies' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 386-387. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being [[Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 465. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[linguistic relativity]], i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; [[Africa]] has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as [[music]], [[art]], and [[storytelling]]. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 458. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Preiss DD and Strasser K (2006) 'Creativity in Latin America' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 46. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges,&lt;ref&gt;Smith GJW and Carlsson I (2006) 'Creativity under the Northern Lights' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 202. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Preiser S (2006) 'Creativity Research in German-Speaking Countries' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 175. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In organizations ==
[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|right|Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in [[Brazil]]. The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]

It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.

Amabile&lt;ref name="Amabile98"&gt;(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:
* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),
* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),
* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).

There are two types of motivation:
* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] – [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,
* [[intrinsic motivation]] – comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.

Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
* Challenge – matching people with the right assignments;
* Freedom – giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;
* [[Resource]]s – such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;
* Work group features – [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;
* [[Supervisor]]y encouragement – recognitions, cheering, praising;
* Organizational support – value emphasis, information sharing, [[collaboration]].

Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.&lt;ref name="Nonaka91"&gt;(Nonaka, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.

In business, [[originality]] is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and [[Cause of action|actionable]].&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1998). "How to kill creativity". Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siltala, R. 2010. Innovativity and cooperative learning in business life and teaching. University of Turku&lt;/ref&gt; [[Competitive intelligence|Creative competitive intelligence]] is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to [[innovation]] process and [[competitive intelligence]] to creative workers.

Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, S. y Urrea J. "Ingenio y Pasión" (2013), Lid Publishers (Spanish) and Forbes India Magazine http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

The investigation by Loo (2017) &lt;ref&gt;Loo, S. (2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Routledge Ltd. {{ISBN|9781138211391}}; {{ISBN|9781315453095}}. https://www.routledge.com/Creative-Working-in-the-Knowledge-Economy/Loo/p/book/9781138211391&lt;/ref&gt; on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the ‘”Four C” model’, ‘Theories of creative processes’, ‘Creativity as a subset of intelligence’, ‘Creativity and personality’, and ‘In organisations’ It is the last section that the investigation addresses.

Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors – especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O’Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).

Loo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.

The study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities – e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and ‘encultured environments’ are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a ‘variation’ on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.

This investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one’s job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.

There are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. ‘general sponge’ and ’in tune with the zeitgeist’ [advertising], and ‘power of expression’ and ‘sensitivity’ [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. ‘integration of advertising activities’ [advertising], and ‘autonomous decentralized systems’ [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. ‘three-dimensional trust’ and ‘green credentials’ [advertising], and ‘collaboration with HEIs and industry’ and ‘ADS system in the Tokyo train operator’ [IT software]).

The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.

This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.

'''[[Team Composition]]'''

Diversity between team members’ backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822–832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

'''Team Processes'''

Team communication [[norm (social)|norm]]s, such as respecting others’ expertise, paying attention to others’ ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, [[negotiation|negotiating]], remaining open to others’ ideas, learning from others, and building on each other’s ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with [[brainstorming]] and [[problem solving]]. Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], which facilitates collective creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Organizational culture|'''Organizational Culture''']]

Supportive and motivational environments that create [[psychological safety]] by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Organizations in which [[help-seeking]], [[Helping behavior|help giving]], and [[collaboration]] are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargadon | first1 = A.

==Economic views of creativity==
Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects — the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity (innovation).

In the early 20th century, [[Joseph Schumpeter]] introduced the economic theory of ''[[creative destruction]]'', to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.

[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a "[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]" model of creativity.&lt;ref name="RubRunc1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A. Runco |title=The psychoeconomic approach to creativity|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=131–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive [[utility]], and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.&lt;ref name="Diamond1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90023-S|last=Diamond|first=Arthur M.|title=Creativity and Interdisciplinarity: A Response to Rubenson and Runco|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[creative class]]'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with "3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.

==Fostering creativity==
{{Main|Creativity techniques}}

Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative_problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].

Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:

==Creativity and education policies==

Some see the conventional system of [[education|schooling]] as "stifling" of creativity and attempt (particularly in the [[preschool]]/[[kindergarten]] and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name="Csik99handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi|first=Mihály|title=Handbook of Creativity|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor=R.

Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education (1998).

Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ByrgeHanson2009 /&gt; In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The manifesto : a guide to developing a creative career|last=Torrance|first=E.

===Scotland===
In the [[Education in Scotland|Scottish education system]], creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life and work and is defined as “a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual.  It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities.” [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)] The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/Creative%20Learning%20Networks] and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education – curiosity, open—mindedness, imagination and problem solving. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/What%20are%20creativity%20skills?] Distinctions are made between creative learning (when learners are using their creativity skills), creative teaching (when educators are using their creativity skills) and creative change (when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement). [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/documents/creativity/cre24_infographics/cre24-the-big-picture.pdf] Scotland’s national Creative Learning Plan [http://www.creativescotland.com/resources/our-publications/plans-and-strategy-documents/scotlands-creative-learning-plan-2013] supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators’ expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources have been created to support and assess this [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/Pages/Search.aspx?k=Creativity%20infographics] including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Education. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)]

===United States===
Creativity has also been identified as one of the key [[21st century skills]] and as one of the  [[Four Cs of 21st century learning]] by educational leaders and theorists in the United States.

'''Culture.pl''' is a large [[web portal]] devoted to [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]]. It was founded by the [[Adam Mickiewicz Institute]] in March 2001. Written in Polish, English and Russian, the site promotes the work of Polish artists around the world and is a popular information database on all artistic aspects of Polish culture. Its [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] number is 1734-0624.

== Structure ==

As well as acting as a database, the site covers current cultural events related to Poland, especially those that take place in other countries. According to its website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.pl/en/article/culturepl-how-it-all-began|title=Culture.pl: How it All Began - Article - Culture.pl|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of 2015 Culture.pl has around 38,000 articles (8,000 of which are in English) shared across the categories Music, Visual Arts, Film, Theatre, Dance, Literature, Comics, Architecture, Photography, Design, and Other. While a large part of the site is on Polish artists and their works, there is also information on around 700 cultural institutions such as museums, galleries, philharmonic halls, theatres and art schools. Many articles are written in English and specifically aimed at international audiences.

The portal was founded in March 2001. The project was initially conceived and designed by Andrzej Lubomirski, who also acted as editor-in-chief until 2008. Subsequent editors-in-chief have included Monika Rencławowicz (2008 – 2009), Elżbieta Sawicka (2009 – 2012), Weronika Kostyrko (2012 – 2016) and John Beauchamp (2016 – present).

== Reception ==

In 2010, the monthly magazine Press named Culture.pl the best polish-language cultural portal on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iam.pl/pl/nowa-odslona-culturepl|title=Nowa odsłona culture.pl|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the portal won the "Culture on the Net” category in TVP Kultura’s annual “Guarantee of Culture” awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvpkultura.tvp.pl/19698995/gwarancje-kultury|title=TVP Kultura - Telewizja Polska S.A.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prizes recognise the most interesting and important Polish cultural stars of the year.

'''''Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening''''' (1944) is a [[Surrealism|surrealist]] painting by [[Salvador Dalí]]. A short, alternate title for the painting is '''''Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee'''''. It was painted in 1944, while Dalí and his wife, [[Gala Dalí|Gala]], were living in America.&lt;ref name=fulcrum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulcrumgallery.com/Salvador-Dali/Dream-Caused-by-the-Flight-of-a-Bee-Around-a-Pomegranate-A-Second-Before-Awakening_24430.htm|title=Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate, A Second Before Awakening|publisher=Fulcrum Gallery|accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

In this "hand-painted dream photograph", as Dalí generally called his paintings, there is a seascape of distant horizons and calm waters, perhaps [[Port Lligat]], amidst which Gala is the subject of the scene. Next to the naked body of the sleeping woman, which levitates above a flat rock that floats above the sea, Dalí depicts two suspended droplets of water and a [[pomegranate]], a Christian symbol of fertility and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Peter|title=A Dictionary Of Christian Art (Oxford Paperback Reference)|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location="Pomegranate"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above the pomegranate flies a bee, an insect that traditionally symbolizes the Virgin.&lt;ref name="World History Of Beekeeping"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crane|first=Eva|title=The World History OF Beekeeping And Honey Hunting|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-92467-2|pages=600–610|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ANTSvKj1AZEC&amp;pg=PA605&amp;dq=bee+christian+virginity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fMa5TdLvFtS_gQe63eET&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bee%20christian%20virginity&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the upper left of the painting what seems to be a [[yelloweye rockfish]] bursts out of the pomegranate, and in turn spews out a tiger that then spews out another tiger and a rifle with a bayonet that is about to sting Gala in the arm. Above them is Dalí's first use of an elephant with long flamingo legs, found in his later compositions such as ''[[The Temptation of St. Anthony (Dalí)|The Temptation of St. Anthony]]''. The elephant carries on its back an obelisk, inspired by Bernini’s ''[[Elephant and Obelisk]]'' in Rome's Piazza [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dahlberg|first=Kristina|title=Bernini's Little Chick|url=http://honorsaharchive.blogspot.com/2007/02/berninis-elephant-obelisk-pulcino-della.html|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thyssen&gt;{{cite web|last=Thyssen|first=Museo|title=Permanent Collection|url=http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/ficha_obra/352|work=Museo Thyssen Permanent Collection|publisher=Museo Thyssen|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and symbolism==

The bayonet, as a symbol of the [[Bee sting|stinging bee]], may represent the woman's abrupt awakening from her otherwise peaceful dream. This is  an example of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s influence on surrealist art and Dalí's attempts to explore the world of [[dream]]s in a dreamscape.&lt;ref name=fulcrum /&gt;

The elephant is a distorted version of the [[Piazza della Minerva]] sculpture ''[[Elephant and Obelisk]]'' by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] facing the church of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] in Rome.&lt;ref name=Leroy&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBZbhP3rW-YC&amp;pg=RA1-PA44&amp;lpg=RA1-cioooo |title=Surrealism|year=2004|author=Cathrin Klingsöhr-Leroy|accessdate=2008-01-08 | isbn=978-3-8228-2215-9 | publisher=Taschen}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--publisher=TaschenISBN=3822822159--&gt; The smaller pomegranate floating between two droplets of water may symbolize Venus, especially because of the heart-shaped shadow it casts.&lt;ref name=Leroy /&gt; It may also be used as a Christian symbol of fertility and resurrection.&lt;ref name=Paloma /&gt; This female symbolism may contrast with the phallic symbolism of the threatening creatures.&lt;ref name=Leroy /&gt;

It has also been suggested that the painting is "a surrealist interpretation of the [[Theory of Evolution]]."&lt;ref name=ijdb&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/contents.php?vol=47&amp;issue=7-8|title=Evolution &amp; Development|year=2003|author=Jaume Baguñà and Jordi García-Fernández|journal=The International Journal of Developmental Biology|accessdate=2012-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819224327/http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/contents.php?vol=47&amp;issue=7-8|archivedate=2012-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Dalí said this painting was intended "to express for the first time in images [[Freud]]'s discovery of the typical dream with a lengthy narrative, the consequence of the instantaneousness of a chance event which causes the sleeper to wake up. Thus, as a bar might fall on the neck of a sleeping person, causing them to wake up and for a long dream to end with the guillotine blade falling on them, the noise of the bee here provokes the sensation of the sting which will awaken Gala."&lt;ref name=Paloma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museothyssen.org/thyssen_ing/coleccion/obras_ficha_texto388.html|title=Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee around a Pomegranate a Second before Waking up|author=Paloma Alarcó|publisher=Museo de Arte Thyssen-Bornemisza|accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guillotine anecdote refers to a dream reported by [[Alfred Maury]] in ''[[Le sommeil et les rêves]]'' ("Sleep and Dreams") and related by Freud in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''.

'''Flappers''' were a generation of young [[Western world|Western]] women in the 1920s who wore short skirts, [[Bob cut|bobbed]] their hair, listened to [[Jazz#1920s and 1930s|jazz]], and flaunted their disdain for what was then considered acceptable behavior. Flappers were seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, [[Distilled beverage|drinking]], smoking [[cigarettes]], driving automobiles, [[Casual sex|treating sex in a casual manner]], and otherwise flouting social and sexual norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://history1900s.about.com/od/1920s/a/flappers.htm |title=Flappers in the Roaring Twenties|first=Jennifer|last=Rosenberg|accessdate=April 4, 2010| publisher =[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flappers are icons of the [[Roaring Twenties]], the social, political turbulence and increased transatlantic cultural exchange that followed the end of [[World War I]], as well as the export of American jazz culture to Europe.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Violet Romer in flapper dress, LC-DIG-ggbain-12393 crop.jpg|thumb|left|237px|[[Violet Romer]] in a flapper dress c. 1915]]
The term possibly originated in slang, but there is no direct evidence of that. The slang term "flapper" may derive from an earlier use in northern England to mean "teenage girl", referring to one whose hair is not yet put up and whose plaited pigtail "flapped" on her back;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Ivan H. ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' (rev. ed.) New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1981 {{ISBN|0-06-014903-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from an older word meaning "prostitute".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/flapper | title = Online Etymology Dictionary | contribution = flapper | date = April 26, 2007 | publisher = Reference}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The slang word "flap" was used for a young prostitute as early as 1631.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Mabbe|Mabbe, James]]. ''Celestina'' IX. 110 "Fall to your flap, my Masters, kisse and clip"; 112 "Come hither, you foule flappes."&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1890s, the word "flapper" was used in some localities as slang both for a very young prostitute,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Barrere | last2 = Leland | title = Dictionary of Slang | quote = Flippers, flappers, very young girls trained to vice | year = 1889}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teenage&gt;[[Jon Savage|Savage, Jon]]. ''Teenage: The Creation of Youth Culture''. New York: Viking, 2007. p. 202. {{ISBN|978-0-670-03837-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in a more general and less derogatory sense, of any lively mid-teenage girl.&lt;ref&gt;Lowsley, Barzillai. ''A glossary of Berkshire words and phrases'' 1888 (E.D.S.):  "Vlapper, .. applied in joke to a girl of the bread-and-butter age."&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard non-slang usage appeared in print as early as 1903 in England and 1904 in the United States, when novelist Desmond Coke used it in his college story of Oxford life, ''Sandford of Merton'': "There's a stunning flapper".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = [[Oxford English Dictionary]] | year = 1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 English actor [[George Graves (actor)|George Graves]] explained it to Americans as theatrical slang for acrobatic young female stage performers.&lt;ref name="Graves 1907"&gt;{{cite journal|work=The New York Times|date=February 3, 1907|title=The Comedy Old Man and His Troubles|type=interview with English comedy actor George Graves|quote=What are 'flappers'?  Why, they are the young girls with their hair still hanging down their backs. They are the sort that can climb up ropes hand over hand and pose at the top.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flapper was also known as a dancer, who danced like a bird-flapping her arms while doing the Charleston dance move. This move became quite a competitive dance during this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jazz Age. The 20s.|last=|first=|publisher=Editors of the Time-Life Books.|year=1997|isbn=|location=Alexandria, Virginia.|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1908, newspapers as serious as ''[[The Times]]'' used the term, although with careful explanation: "A 'flapper', we may explain, is a young lady who has not yet been promoted to long frocks and the wearing of her hair 'up'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Times | date = February 20, 1908 | issue = 38574 | at = p 15, col F}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1908, the fashion section of London's ''The Globe and Traveler'' contained a sketch entitled "The Dress of the Young Girl" with the following explanation: &lt;blockquote&gt;Americans, and those fortunate English folk whose money and status permit them to go in freely for slang terms ... call the subject of these lines the 'flapper.' The appropriateness of this term does not move me to such whole-hearted admiration of the amazing powers of enriching our language which the Americans modestly acknowledge they possess ..., [and] in fact, would scarcely merit the honour of a moment of my attention, but for the fact that I seek in vain for any other expression that is understood to signify that important young person, the maiden of some sixteen years.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The sketch is of a girl in a frock with a long skirt,"which has the waistline quite high and semi-Empire, ... quite untrimmed, its plainness being relieved by a sash knotted carelessly around the skirt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Globe and Traveler|title=The Dress of the Young Girl|date=April 11, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 1910, the word was popular enough for A. E. James to begin a series of stories in the ''[[London Magazine]]'' featuring the misadventures of a pretty fifteen-year-old girl and titled "Her Majesty the Flapper".&lt;ref&gt;James, A. E. [http://www.philsp.com/homeville/FMI/f25.htm "Her Majesty the Flapper"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204031128/http://www.philsp.com/homeville/fmi/f25.htm |date=December 4, 2009 }}. ''[[London Magazine]]'' (November, 1910)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1911, a newspaper review indicates the mischievous and flirtatious "flapper" was an established stage-type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | newspaper = The Times | date = March 23, 1911 | issue = 39540 | at = p 10, col C | title = Review of the 1911 comedy ''Lady Patricia'' | quote = Now the 'flapper' is Miss Clare Lesley, the Dean's tomboy daughter...}}  In the play a mature married couple, Patricia and Michael, vainly pursue slang-talking teenagers Billy and Clare, and so "Clare, out of the charity of youth for enamoured maturity, indulges Michael with a little mild flirtation" before at the end finding real love with Billy, who is her own age. The actress playing the flapper is characterized as "full of youth and 'go'".&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912, the London theatrical impresario [[John Tiller]], defining the word in an interview he gave to the ''[[New York Times]]'', described a "flapper" as belonging to a slightly older age group, a girl who has "just come out".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = Mr. Tiller explained the difference between a "pony" and a "flapper". A pony, he said, is a small dancer who may be of any age. A flapper is a girl who has just "come out". She is at an awkward age, neither a child nor a woman, and she is just as likely to develop into a show girl as a pony. | title = Some facts about the ballet |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 31, 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiller's use of the phrase "come out" means "to make a formal entry into 'society' on reaching womanhood".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;  In polite society at the time, a teenage girl who had not [[Debutante|come out]] would still be classed as a child. She would be expected to keep a low profile on social occasions and ought not to be the object of male attention. Although the word was still largely understood as referring to high-spirited teenagers&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Times | date = July 15, 1914 | issue = 40576 | at = p 1, col B | quote = The father of a young lady, aged 15&amp;nbsp;– a typical "FLAPPER"&amp;nbsp;– with all the self assurance of a woman of 30 would be grateful for the recommendation of a seminary (not a convent) where she might be placed for a year or two with the object of taming her. It is not EDUCATION she requires, she has too much of that already...}}&lt;/ref&gt; gradually in Britain it was being extended to describe any impetuous immature woman.{{Efn | In a 1913 letter a man addressed his 21-year-old girlfriend as his "flapper".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = I cannot bear to think of my flapper without an engagement ring. | newspaper = The Times | date = October 16, 1913 | issue = 40344 | at = p 15, col D | title = £600 Damages For Breach of Promise}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} By late 1914, the British magazine ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' was reporting that the Flapper was beginning to disappear in England, being replaced by the so-called "Little Creatures."&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (December 1914) [http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/1914-FLAPPERS-pdf "The Melancholy Passing of the Flapper"] ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Times'' article on the problem of finding jobs for women made unemployed by the return of the male workforce is headed "The Flapper's Future".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Times | date = October 16, 1919 | issue = 42232 | at = p 7, col B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this influence, the meaning of the term changed somewhat, to apply to "independent, pleasure-seeking, khaki-crazy young women".&lt;ref name=teenage /&gt;

[[File:The Flapper (1920) - 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An advertisement for the 1920 [[silent film]] comedy ''[[The Flapper]]'', with [[Olive Thomas]], before the look of the flapper had started to come together.]]
In his lecture in February 1920 on Britain's surplus of young women caused by the loss of young men in war, Dr. R. Murray-Leslie criticized "the social butterfly type... the frivolous, scantily-clad, jazzing flapper, irresponsible and undisciplined, to whom a dance, a new hat, or a man with a car, were of more importance than the fate of nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|newspaper=The Times|date=February 5, 1920|issue=42326|at=p 9, col A}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In May of that year, [[Selznick International Pictures|Selznick Pictures]] released ''[[The Flapper]]'' a silent comedy film starring [[Olive Thomas]]. It was the first film in the United States to portray the "flapper" lifestyle. By that time, the term had taken on the full meaning of the flapper generation style and attitudes.

The use of the term coincided with a fashion among teenage girls in the United States in the early 1920s for wearing unbuckled [[galoshes]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/29/107046892.pdf "Flappers flaunt fads in footwear"] ''The [[New York Times]]'' (January 29, 1922).  The article alleges the origin of the fashion was a [[Douglas Fairbanks]] costume in the film ''[[The Three Musketeers (1921 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'', in which he wore his boot-tops turned down.&lt;/ref&gt; and a widespread [[false etymology]] held that they were called "flappers" because they flapped when they walked, as they wore their overshoes or galoshes unfastened, showing that they defied convention in a manner similar to the 21st century fad for untied shoelaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Basinger | first = Jeanne | title = Silent Stars | publisher = Wesleyan | year = 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strong, Marion in {{Citation | quote = The more noise the buckles made, the better they flapped, that's why we were called flappers | last = Brady | first = Kathleen | title = Lucille: The life of Lucille Ball | publisher = Billboard | year = 2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion to the origin of the term, in relation to fashion, comes from a 1920s fashion trend in which young women left their overcoat unbuttoned to allow it to flap back and forth as they walked, appearing more independent and freed from the tight, Victorian Era style clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, Jim. The 1920s Decade in photos: The Roaring Twenties. Berkeley Heights, New Jersey: Enslow Publishers, Inc, 2009, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1930s in Britain, although still occasionally used, the word "flapper" had become associated with the past. In 1936 a ''Times'' journalist grouped it with terms such as "blotto" as outdated slang: "[blotto] evokes a distant echo of glad rags and flappers ... It recalls a past which is not yet 'period'."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London, England): "Delivering Drunkards", December 2, 1936, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
{{quote box|bgcolor=#CCDDFF|align=right|width=25%|fontsize=1-1%|quote='''"In all countries, the First World War weakened old orthodoxies and authorities, and, when it was over, neither government nor church nor school nor family had the power to regulate the lives of human beings as it had once done. One result of this was a profound change in manners and morals that made a freer and less restrained society.  Women benefited from this as much as anyone else. Time-worn prescriptions concerning what was or was not proper behavior for them no longer possessed much credibility, and taboos about unaccompanied appearances in public places, or the use of liquor or tobacco, or even pre-marital sexual relationships had lost their force. ...

Craig|Craig, Gordon A.]] (1991) ''The Germans'' New York: Merdian. p.161. {{ISBN|9780452010857}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
One cause of the change in young women's behavior was [[World War I]] which ended in November 1918. The death of large numbers of young men in the war, and the [[Spanish flu]] epidemic which struck in 1918 killing between 20–40&amp;nbsp;million people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Flappers: A Guide to an American Subculture|last=Sagert|first=Kelly Boyer|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2010|isbn=9780313376900|location=Santa Barbara CA|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired in young people a feeling that life is short and could end at any moment. Therefore, young women wanted to spend their youth enjoying their life and freedom rather than just staying at home and waiting for a man to marry them.&lt;ref&gt;Cellania, M. (2013, March 25).

Political changes were another cause of the flapper culture. World War I reduced the grip of the class system on both sides of the Atlantic, encouraging different classes to mingle and share their sense of freedom.&lt;ref name=mcg20to29&gt;McGlinchey, S.

The first appearance of the flapper style{{Efn|The word itself was introduced earlier.&lt;ref name="Graves 1907" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Staff|newspaper=New Brunswick Times|date=February 24, 1910|quote=And over in England, as I learned, they call a girl of about fifteen a "flapper."...}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in the United States came from the popular 1920 [[Frances Marion]] film, ''[[The Flapper]]'', starring [[Olive Thomas]].&lt;ref name="olive"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.assumption.edu/ahc/1920s/Olive%20Thomas/ | title = Olive Thomas | contribution = Memories of Olive | publisher = Assumption | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130412055632/http://www1.assumption.edu/ahc/1920s/Olive%20Thomas/ | archivedate = April 12, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas starred in a similar role in 1917, though it was not until ''The Flapper'' that the term was used. In her final movies, she was seen as the flapper image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Long | editor-first = Bruce | url = http://www.public.asu.edu/~ialong/Taylor33.txt | title = Taylorology: A Continuing Exploration of the Life and Death of William Desmond Taylor | publisher = Arizona State University}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other actresses, such as [[Clara Bow]], [[Louise Brooks]], [[Colleen Moore]] and [[Joan Crawford]] would soon build their careers on the same image, achieving great popularity.&lt;ref name="olive" /&gt;

In the United States, popular contempt for [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was a factor in the rise of the flapper. With legal saloons and cabarets closed, back alley [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]] became prolific and popular. This discrepancy between the law-abiding, religion-based [[temperance movement]] and the actual ubiquitous consumption of alcohol led to widespread disdain for authority. Flapper independence was also a response to the [[Gibson girl]]s of the 1890s.{{Sfn | De Castelbajac | 1995 | p = 35}}&lt;ref name=conor&gt;Conor, Liz. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jWG2_Pt2Dw8C&amp;pg=PA301 ''The Spectacular Modern Woman: Feminine Visibility in The 1920s''] 2004. p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; Although that pre-war look does not resemble the flapper style, their independence may have led to the flapper wisecracking tenacity 30 years later.

Writers in the United States such as [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Anita Loos]] and illustrators such as [[Russell Patterson]], [[John Held, Jr.]], [[Ethel Hays]] and [[Faith Burrows]] popularized the flapper look and lifestyle through their works, and flappers came to be seen as attractive, reckless, and independent. Among those who criticized the flapper craze was writer-critic [[Dorothy Parker]], who penned "Flappers: A Hate Song" to poke fun at the [[fad]]. The secretary of labor denounced the "flippancy of the cigarette smoking, cocktail-drinking flapper".{{Sfn|Zeitz|2007|p=6}}  A Harvard psychologist reported that flappers had "the lowest degree of intelligence" and constituted "a hopeless problem for educators".{{Sfn|Zeitz|2007|p=6}}

Another writer, Lynne Frame, said in her book that a large number of scientists and health professionals have analyzed and reviewed the degree of femininity of flappers' appearance and behavior, given the "boyishness" of the flapper look and behavior. Some gynecologists gave the opinion that women were less "marriageable" if they were less "feminine", as the husband would be unhappy in his marriage. In Frame's book, she also wrote that the appearance of flappers, like the short hair and short dress, distracted attention from feminine curves to the legs and body. These attributes were not only a fashion trend but also the expression of a blurring of gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Reinsch, O. (2013).

===The Gibson Girl===
The Gibson Girl was one of the origins of the flapper. The invention of [[Charles Dana Gibson]], the Gibson Girl changed the fashion, patterns, and lifestyles of the 1920s; these were much more progressive than the traditions of women's styles in the past. Before the Gibson Girl movement, women's voices as a group were infrequently heard. While some may see the Gibson Girl as just a fashion statement, it was much more broadly influential than that. "She depicted the modern woman, known popularly as the 'new woman', at a time when more women gained independence, began to work outside the home, and sought the right to vote and other rights."&lt;ref name="fashionencyclopedia.com"&gt;Staff (ndg) [http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/Modern-World-1900-1918/The-Gibson-Girl.html "The Gibson Girl"] ''Encyclopedia of Fashion'' website. Retrieved October 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's illustrations showed feminist women of all kinds who worried more about themselves than about pleasing the men in their lives. It was the first time a woman could actually concentrate on her own dreams and goals. The Gibson Girl also exemplified the importance of intelligence and learning rather than catering to men's needs.

According to Kate Chopin, "The Gibson Girl influenced society in the early 1900s much like [[Barbie]] influenced society of the late 1900s. The Gibson Girl crossed many societal lines opening the way for women to participate in things they had never done before. She, like Barbie, portrayed women as strong individuals who could play sports while maintaining perfectly coiffed hair and dress. She was criticized by many, much like Barbie, for creating an unrealistic ideal of what women should look like: perfect proportions and long flowing hair. Despite the criticism she was a trend setter, a model for women in both dress and action, just like Barbie."&lt;ref&gt;Chopin, Kate (ndg) [http://www.loyno.edu/~kchopin/new/women/gibsongirl.html "The Gibson Girl"] Retrieved October 25, 2016, from&lt;/ref&gt;

The fashion of the Gibson Girl allowed them a much more active lifestyle then previously, in both work and recreation. "Skirts were long and flared, and dresses were tailored with high necks and close-fitting sleeves. The style was considered masculine, and this was sometimes emphasized by wearing a necktie. Though women still wore the restrictive undergarments known as corsets, a new health corset came into style that was said to be better for the spine than earlier corsets. An S-shaped figure became trendy, with a large bust and large hips, separated by a tiny, corseted waist. These styles, worn with confidence and poise by modern women. ... She might be pictured at a desk in a tailored shirtwaist or at a tennis party in an informal sports dress. She wore her long hair upswept in an elaborate mass of curls, perhaps topped by a simple straw hat. Though she was capable and independent, the Gibson girl was always beautiful and elegant."&lt;ref name="fashionencyclopedia.com" /&gt; According to the [[Library of Congress]], "Gibson's meticulous depiction of their hats accentuates the Gibson Girls' stylish attire and visually reinforces the impression of height, leading the eye to the mountains. ... Gibson shows off the classic Gibson Girl as a figure who embraced outdoor physical activities."&lt;ref&gt;Staff (ndg) [https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/gibson-girls-america/the-gibson-girl-as-the-new-woman.html "The Gibson Girl as the 'New Woman'"] ''The Gibson Girl's America: Drawings by Charles Dana Gibson'' [[Library of COngress]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gibson Girl was uniquely American compared to European standards of style. She was an ideal: youthful, feminist, strong and a truly modern woman. Gibson emphasized that any women can be represented as a Gibson Girl, both those in the middle and the upper class. Minnie Clark, known as "the original Gibson Girl", was a model for Gibson and could portray any type of women needed for his illustration. Gibson drew with characteristic grace women all of races and classes so that any woman could feel that they, too, could be a graceful Gibson Girl.

===Magazines===
[[File:FlappermagNovpg2.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Flapper Magazine'' inner page]]
In 1922, a small-circulation magazine – ''The Flapper'', located in Chicago – celebrated the flapper's appeal. On the opening page of its first issue, it proudly declared flappers' break with traditional values. Also, flappers defended them by contrasting themselves with earlier generations of women whom they called "clinging vines". They mocked the confining fashions and demure passivity of older women and reveled in their own freedom. They did not even acknowledge that the previous generation of female activists had made the flappers' freedom possible.&lt;ref name="ultimatehistoryproject.com"&gt;Ferentinos, S. (n.d.). ''Not for Old Fogies: The Flapper''. Retrieved May 18, 2016, from http://www.ultimatehistoryproject.com/flapper.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, new magazines appealed to young German women with a sensuous image and advertisements for the appropriate clothes and accessories they would want to purchase. The glossy pages of ''Die Dame'' and ''Das Blatt der Hausfrau'' displayed the "Girl"—the flapper. She was young and fashionable, financially independent, and was an eager consumer of the latest fashions. The magazines kept her up to date on fashion, arts, sports, and modern technology such as automobiles and telephones.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Sylvester, "Before Cosmopolitan: The Girl in German women's magazines in the 1920s". ''Journalism Studies'' 8#4 (2007): 550–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
Even though many young women in the 1920s saw flappers as the symbol of a brighter future, some also questioned the flappers' more extreme behavior. Therefore, in 1923, the magazine began asking for true stories from its readers for a new column called "Confessions of a Flapper". Some of these were lighthearted stories of girls getting the better of those who underestimated them, but others described girls betraying their own standards of behavior in order to live up to the image of flappers. There were several examples: a newlywed confessed to having cheated on her husband, a college student described being told by a boyfriend that she was not "the marrying kind" because of the sexual liberties she had permitted him, and a minister's daughter recounted the humiliation of being caught in the lie of pretending she was older and more sophisticated than she was. Many readers thought that flappers had gone too far in their quest for adventure. One 23-year-old "ex-vamp" declared: "In my opinion, the average flappers from 15 to 19 were brainless, inconsiderate of others, and easy to get into serious trouble."&lt;ref name="ultimatehistoryproject.com"/&gt;

So, among the readers of ''The Flapper'', parts of them were celebrated for flappers' spirit and appropriation of male privilege, while parts of them acknowledged the dangers of emulating flappers too faithfully, with some even confessing to violating their own codes of ethics so as to live up to all the hype.&lt;ref name="ultimatehistoryproject.com"/&gt;

===American banks and "flapper" employees===
According to a report in 1922, some banks across the United States started to regulate the dress and deportment of young female employees who were considered to be "flappers". It began with a complaint of a mother in New Jersey who felt dissatisfied because her son did business only with a young female employee, whom she considered illegally attractive. The incident was duly reported to the officials of the bank, and rules adopted regarding requirements in dress for female employees. Those rules included that the dress should not have a pattern, it should be bought from a specific store, it must be worn in either black, blue or brown, its sleeves must not be shortened above the elbow, and its hem must not be worn higher than twelve inches from the ground. After that, the anti-flapper code soon spread to the Federal Reserve, where female employees were firmly told that there was no time for them to beautify themselves during office hours.&lt;ref name=mcg20to29 /&gt;

== Image of youth ==
The flapper stands as one of the most enduring images of youth and new women in the twentieth century, and is viewed by modern-day Americans as something of a cultural heroine. However, back in the 1920s, many Americans regarded flappers as threatening to conventional society, representing a new moral order. Although most of them were the daughters of the middle class, they flouted middle-class values. They shrugged off their chaperones, danced suggestively, and openly flirted with boys. "Flappers prized style over substance, novelty over tradition, and pleasure over virtue."&lt;ref name="ultimatehistoryproject.com"/&gt; Ruth Gillettes, a 1920s singer, had a song called "Oh Say! Can I See You Tonight?" which expresses the new behavior of girls in the 1920s. Before the 1920s, for a woman to call a man to suggest a date would be impossible. But in the 1920s, many girls seemed to play a leading role in relationships, actively asking boys out or even coming to their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, S. (2006). ''Roaring '20s fashions: Deco''. Atglen, PA: Schiffer Publishing, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Flappers' behavior was considered outlandish at the time and redefined women's roles. In the English media they were stereotyped as pleasure-loving, reckless and prone to defy convention by initiating sexual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work = The Weekly Dispatch|date=July 29, 1917|page=7 | title="Sporting" girls and the risks they run.

The article concludes "And over in England, as I learned, they call a girl of about fifteen a 'flapper'. If I were still but fifteen I am sure I would prefer being a backfisch."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the concept of "''Backfisch''" was known in England by the late 1880s, the term was understood to mean a very demure social type&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = Let us introduce the word 'Backfisch', for we have the Backfisch always with us.

The evolving image of flappers was of independent young women who went by night to [[jazz club]]s such as those in [[Harlem, New York|Harlem]], which were viewed as erotic and dangerous, where they danced provocatively, smoked cigarettes and [[Dating (activity)|dated]] freely, perhaps indiscriminately. They were active, sporting, [[Bicycles#Female emancipation|rode bicycles]], drove cars, and openly drank alcohol, a defiant act in the American period of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = President of the League of American Pen Women, Mrs William Atherton | last = du Puy | quote = Yes, girls do smoke, and there is no harm if they don't go to excess.

Flappers also began working outside the home and challenging women's traditional societal roles and the monolithic historical idea of women being powerless throughout social history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Posing a Threat: Flappers, Chorus Girls, and other Brazen Performers of the American 1920s|last=Latham|first=Angela J.|publisher=University Press of New England|year=2000|isbn=9780819564016|location=Hanover, NH|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were considered a significant challenge to traditional [[Victorian era|Victorian]] gender roles, devotion to plain-living, hard work and religion. Increasingly, women discarded old, rigid ideas about roles and embraced consumerism and personal choice, and were often described in terms of representing a "culture war" of old versus new. Flappers also advocated voting and women's rights.

In this manner, flappers were a result of larger social changes – women were able to vote in the United States in 1920, and religious society had been rocked by the [[Scopes trial]].&lt;ref&gt;Zeitz, 2007. "Here was where the modern culture could prove threatening to the Victorians. The ethos of the consumer market glorified not only self-indulgence and satisfaction, but also personal liberty and choice. It invited relativism in all matters ranging from color schemes and bath soap to religion, politics, sex and morality."&lt;/ref&gt;

For all the concern about women stepping out of their traditional roles, however, many flappers were not engaged in politics. In fact, older [[suffragette]]s, who fought for the right for women to vote, viewed flappers as vapid and in some ways unworthy of the enfranchisement they had worked so hard to win.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitz, 2007. "Others argued, though, that flappers' laissez-faire attitude was simply a natural progression of feminine liberation, the right having already been won."; p.107: "T[he Jazz Age flapper ... [was] [d]isengaged from politics..."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy Dunbar Bromley]], a noted liberal writer at the time, summed up this dichotomy by describing flappers as "truly modern", "New Style" feminists who "admit that a full life calls for marriage and children" and also "are moved by an inescapable inner compulsion to be individuals in their own right".{{Sfn|Zeitz|2007|p=117}}

=== Petting parties ===
[[Foreplay|Petting]] became more common than in the [[Victorian era]]. "[[Making out|Petting parties]]", where petting ("making out" or foreplay) was the main attraction, became popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff| title = Mothers Complain that Modern Girls 'Vamp' Their Sons at Petting Parties | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = February 17, 1922}}.&lt;br&gt;An earlier article in the same newspaper rebutted an attack on the behaviour of American girls made recently in the ''Cosmopolitan'' by [[Elinor Glyn]]. It admitted the existence of petting parties but considered the activities were no worse than those which had gone on in earlier times under the guise of "kissing games", adding that tales of what occurred at such events were likely to be exaggerated by an older generation influenced by traditional misogyny&lt;br&gt;{{Cite news | first = Mrs William Atherton | last = Dupuy | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = October 15, 1921|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990DE2DC133EEE3ABC4D52DFB667838A639EDE&amp;legacy=true|title=Let Girls Smoke, Mrs. Dupuy's Plea; Penwomen's President Rises in Defense of Young Thing Who 'Parks Corsets' Before Dance.

Carolyn Van Wyck wrote a column for ''[[Photoplay]]'', an upmarket magazine that featured articles on pop culture, advice on fashion, and even articles on helping readers channel their inner celebrity. In March 1926 an anonymous young woman wrote in describing petting as a problem, explaining "The boys all seem to do it and don't seem to come back if you don't do it also. We girls are at our wits' end to know what to do. ... I'm sure that I don't want to marry anyone who is too slow to want to pet. But I want to discover what is right. Please help me." Van Wyck sympathized with the problem the writer faced and added, "It seems to me much better to be known as a flat tire and keep romance in one's mind than to be called a hot date and have fear in one's heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dubois|first1=Ellen Carol|last2=Dumenil|first2=Lynn|title=Through Women's Eyes|date=2012|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston, MA|page=561|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine depicted petting parties as "that famed and shocking institution of the '20s", and commenting on the '[[Kinsey Report]]', said that they have been "very much with us ever since".&lt;ref&gt;Havemann, Ernest. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EkgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA45 "The Kinsey Report on Women"] [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] (August 24, 1953)&lt;/ref&gt; In the Kinsey Report of 1950, there was an indicated increase in premarital intercourse for the generation of the 1920s. Kinsey found that of women born before 1900, 14 percent acknowledged premarital sex before the age of 25, while those born after 1900 were two and a half times more likely (36 percent) to have premarital intercourse and experience an orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duenil|first=Lynn|title=The Modern Temper:American Culture and Society in the 1920s|date=1995|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York, NY|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slang ===
Flappers were associated with the use of a number of slang words, including "junk", "necker", "heavy petting", and "necking parties",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Shifters No Longer Appeal to Slackers | newspaper = The New York Times | date = March 26, 1922 | quote = The epithets she has evolved from her own lexicon are "junk", "necker" and "heavy necker". "Junk" is anything she considers unimportant or unworthy of consideration. A "necker" is a "petter" who puts her arms around a boy's neck.

"Necking parties" have superseded "petting parties.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although these words existed before the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', online ed., March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Flappers also used the word "jazz" in the sense of anything exciting or fun. Their language sometimes reflected their feelings about dating, marriage and drinking habits: "I have to [[see a man about a dog]]" at this period often meant going to buy whiskey; and a "handcuff" or "manacle" was an engagement or wedding ring. Also reflective of their preoccupations were phrases to express approval, such as "That's so Jake",{{Efn | First occurring as American criminal slang before 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Louis E | last1 = Jackson | first2 = CR | last2 = Hellyer | title = A dictionary of criminal slang | year = 1914}} in {{Citation | title = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = online | date = March 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}(okay);  "That's the [[wikt:bee's knees|bee's knees]]", (a superb person); "Cake-eater," (a ladies' man); and the popular: "the [[wikt:cat's meow|cat's meow]]," (anything wonderful).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Editors of Time-Life|title=The Jazz Age: The 20s|last=|first=|publisher=Time-Life Books|year=1997|isbn=|location=Alexandria, Virginia.|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two more slangs that reflected flapper's behaviors or lifestyles, which were "[[treating]]" and "charity girls". "Treating" was a culture or habit mainly for the working-class flappers. Although they earned money from work, they still wanted to earn some more for them to live. Women were willingly invited to dance, for drinks, for entrances up to jewelry and clothing. For the "return service", women granted any kind of erotic or sexual interaction from flirting to sexual intercourse. However, this practice was easily mistaken for prostitution. So, some people would call them "charity girls" to differentiate them from prostitutes as the girls claimed that they did not accept money in their sexual encounters with men.&lt;ref&gt;Reinsch, O.

== Appearance ==
[[File:Normatalmadge crop.jpg|thumb|200px|Actress [[Norma Talmadge]]]]
In addition to their irreverent behavior, flappers were known for their style, which largely emerged as a result of French fashions,&lt;ref name="Rae" /&gt; especially those pioneered by [[Coco Chanel]], the effect on dress of the rapid spread of American jazz, and the popularization of dancing that accompanied it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.fashion-era.com/flapper_fashion_1920s.htm#The%20Short%20Skirt%20Misconception%20Of%20The%20Twenties | contribution = The Short Skirt Misconception of the Twenties | title = Flapper fashion 1920s | quote = Shortness is a popular misconception reinforced by the availability of moving film of the Charleston dance which shows very visible knees and legs on the dancing flappers. | publisher = Fashion era}}&lt;/ref&gt; Called ''garçonne'' in [[French language|French]] ("boy" with a feminine suffix), flapper style made girls look young and boyish: short hair, flattened breasts, and straight waists accentuated it. By at least 1913, the association between slim adolescence and a certain characteristic look became fixed in the public's mind. [[Lillian Nordica]], commenting on New York fashions that year, referred to

{{Quote | a thin little flapper of a girl donning a skirt in which she can hardly take a step, extinguishing all but her little white teeth with a dumpy bucket of a hat, and tripping down Fifth Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The New York Times | date = January 1, 1913 | title = Mme Nordica Buys No Paris Gowns}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At this early date, it seems that the style associated with a flapper already included the boyish physique&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The New York Times | date = January 1, 1913 | title = Mme Nordica Buys No Paris Gowns | quote = ...when a lady of uncertain age and very certain development attempts the same little costume because it looks well on the thin little girl, well – " And Mme. Nordica left the result to the interviewer's imagination.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and close-fitting hat, but a [[hobble skirt]] rather than one with a high hemline.&lt;ref name="Rae"&gt;{{cite book|last= Kemper|first= Rachel|title= History of Costume|publisher= WW Norton &amp; Co |isbn=978-0-88225-137-0|location=New York|date=December 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the appearance typically associated now with flappers (straight waists, short hair and a hemline above the knee) did not fully emerge until about
1926,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.fashion-era.com/flapper_fashion_1920s.htm#Gabrielle%20%27Coco%27%20Chanel | contribution = Evolution of the flapper fashion | title = Flapper fashion 1920s | publisher = Fashion era}}.&lt;/ref&gt; there was an early association in the public mind between unconventional appearance, outrageous behavior, and the word "flapper". A report in ''The Times'' of a 1915 Christmas entertainment for troops stationed in France described a soldier in drag burlesquing feminine flirtatiousness while wearing "short skirts, a hat of Parisian type&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = ...the jaunty little toque | newspaper = The Times | date = December 23, 1915 | page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and flapper-like hair".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Times | date = December 30, 1915 | issue = 41050 | at = p 7, col E | title = Pantomime At The Front, Soldier "Heroines" | quote = There was, for instance, a Maid Marian in the cast, who was described as a "dainty dam'sell" because she was a sergeant. There was something ridiculously fascinating about that sergeant, for he was in blue short skirts, a hat of Parisian type and flapper-like hair; and when she was instructing Ferdinand, a Bad Lad... in the use of the "glad eye", the great audience shouted with laughter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the scandal flappers generated, their look became fashionable in a toned-down form among respectable older women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Merril D.|title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Breast|date=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780759123328|page=114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrCCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, the flappers removed the [[corset]] from female fashion, raised skirt and gown hemlines, and popularized [[bob cut|short hair]] for women. Among actresses closely identified with the style were &lt;!--alphabetical order, please--&gt;[[Tallulah Bankhead]],&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Kathryn.

Beginning in the early 1920s, flappers began appearing in newspaper comic strips; [[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie Boopadoop]] and [[Nancy (comic strip)|Fritzi Ritz]] – later depicted more domestically, as the wife of Dagwood Bumstead and aunt of Nancy, respectively – were introduced as flappers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonician.com/fritzi-ritz-before-bushmiller-shes-come-a-long-way-baby/|title=Fritzi Ritz Before Bushmiller: She's Come a Long Way, Baby!|work=Hogan's Alley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apparel ===

{{Main|1920s in fashion}}
Flapper dresses were straight and loose, leaving the arms bare (sometimes no straps at all) and dropping the waistline to the hips. Silk or rayon stockings were held up by garters. Skirts rose to just below the knee by 1927, allowing flashes of leg to be seen when a girl danced or walked through a breeze, although the way they danced made any long loose skirt flap up to show their legs. To enhance the view, some flappers applied [[Rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]] to their knees.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry, Helen Bullitt. [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/02/12/98781527.pdf "On the Knees of Our College Girls"] ''The New York Times'' (February 2, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergstein, Rachelle.

[[High-heeled footwear|High heels]] also came into vogue at the time, reaching 2–3 inches (5–8&amp;nbsp;cm) high.&lt;ref name="Rae" /&gt; Favored shoe styles were [[Mary Jane (shoe)|Mary Janes]] and T-straps in classic black, gold, silver, or nude shades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gatsby Party - Your Definitive Fashion Guide|url = http://picvpic.com/fashion101/2015/gatsby-party-fashion/|website = picVpic-Fashion101|access-date = January 13, 2016|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lingerie ====
Flappers did away with [[corset]]s and [[Undergarment|pantaloons]] in favor of "step-in" panties. Without the old restrictive corsets, flappers wore simple bust bodices to restrain their chest when dancing. They also wore new, softer and suppler corsets that reached to their hips, smoothing the whole frame, giving women a straight up and down appearance, as opposed to the old corsets which slenderized the waist and accented the hips and bust.&lt;ref name="Rae" /&gt;

The lack of curves of a corset promoted a boyish look. Adding an even more boyish look, the Symington Side Lacer was invented and became a popular essential as an everyday bra. This type of bra was made to pull in the back to flatten the chest.&lt;ref name="Rae" /&gt; Other women envied flappers for their flat chests and bought the Symington Side Lacer to enhance the same look; large breasts were commonly regarded as a trait of unsophistication. Hence, flat chests became appealing to women, although flappers were the most common to wear such bras.

=== Hair and accessories ===
[[File:MademoisellePolaireStebbing cropped.jpg|thumb|right|French actress [[Polaire]] in 1899]]
Boyish cuts were in vogue and released the weight of the tradition of women being required to grow their hair long, through popular cuts such as the [[bob cut]], [[Eton crop]], and [[shingle bob]]. [[Finger wave|Finger waving]] was used as a means of styling. Hats were still required wear and popular styles included the [[newsboy cap]] and [[cloche hat]].

Jewelry usually consisted of [[art deco]] pieces, especially many layers of beaded necklaces. Pins, rings, and brooches came into style. [[Horn-rimmed glasses]] were also popular.

=== Cosmetics ===
{{Main|Cosmetics in the 1920s}}
As far back as the 1890s, French actress [[Polaire]] pioneered a look which included short, disheveled hair, emphatic mouth and huge eyes heavily outlined in [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Lorrain|title=La Ville Empoisonnée|year=1936|place=Paris|publisher=Jean Cres|page=279|quote= ...the great voracious mouth, the immense black eyes, ringed, bruised, discolored, the incandescence of her pupils, the bewildered nocturnal hair...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | type = category | title = Commons | contribution = Polaire | publisher = Wikimedia | url = http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Polaire}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The evolving flapper look required "heavy makeup" in comparison to what had previously been acceptable outside of professional usage in the theater. With the invention of the metal lipstick container as well as compact mirrors, bee stung lips came into vogue. Dark eyes, especially [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]-rimmed, were the style. [[Rouge (cosmetics)|Blush]] came into vogue now that it was no longer a messy application process. Women shaped their eyebrows needle-thin and penciled them in dark, emulating such actresses as [[Clara Bow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://glamourdaze.com/history-of-makeup/1920s "A Brief History of 1920s Makeuop"] ''Glamour Daze''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valenti, Lauren (April 10, 2014) [http://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/makeup/a9381/eyebrows-through-the-years/ "The History of Women and Their Eyebrows"] ''[[Marie Claire]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, [[pallor|pale]] skin was considered most attractive. However, [[sun tanning|tanned skin]] became increasingly popular after [[Coco Chanel]] showed off a tan after a holiday – it suggested a life of leisure, without the onerous need to work. Women wanted to look fit, sporty, and, above all, healthy.

== Semiotics of the flapper ==
[[File:The Flapper by Frank Xavier Leyendecker.jpg|thumb|225px|''Life Magazine'' cover "The Flapper" by [[Frank Xavier Leyendecker]], 2 February 1922]]
Being liberated from restrictive dress, from laces that interfered with breathing, and from hoops that needed managing suggested liberation of another sort. The new-found freedom to breathe and walk encouraged movement out of the house, and the flapper took full advantage.&lt;ref name="Kriebl 1998 113–128"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kriebl|first=Karen J |title= From bloomers to flappers: the American women's dress reform movement, 1840–1920|journal=Ohio State University|year=1998|pages=113–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flapper was an extreme manifestation of changes in the lifestyles of American women made visible through dress.&lt;ref name="Yellis 1969 44–64"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yellis|first= Kenneth A | title = Prosperity's Child: Some thoughts on the Flapper| work = The American Quarterly|year=1969|pages=44–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in fashion were interpreted as signs of deeper changes in the American feminine ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Lowry|first= Helen| title= As the debutante tells it: more about Mrs Grundy and Miss 1921| work = The New York Times|date= January 30, 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short skirt and bobbed hair were likely to be used as a symbol of [[emancipation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freedman|first=Estelle B.|title=The New Woman: Changing views of Women in the 1920s|journal=The Journal of American History |year=1974|pages=372–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs of the moral revolution consisted of [[premarital sex]], [[birth control]], drinking, and contempt for older values. Before the War, a lady did not set foot in a [[Bar (establishment)|saloon]]; after the War a woman, though no more "a lady", entered a [[speakeasy]] as casually as she would go into a railroad station. Women had started swearing and smoking publicly, using contraceptives, raising their skirts above the knee and rolling their hose below it. Women were now competing with men in the business world and obtaining financial independence and, therefore, other kinds of independence from men.&lt;ref name="Yellis 1969 44–64" /&gt;

The [[New Woman]] was pushing the boundaries of gender roles, representing sexual and economic freedom. She cut her hair short and took to loose-fitting clothing and low cut dresses. No longer restrained by a tight waist and long trailing skirts, the modern woman of the 1920s was an independent thinker, who no longer followed the conventions of those before her.&lt;ref name="Kriebl 1998 113–128" /&gt; The flapper was an example of the prevailing conceptions of women and their roles during the Roaring 1920s. The flappers' ideal was motion with characteristics of intensity, energy, and volatility. She refused the traditional moral code. Modesty, chastity, morality, and traditional concepts of masculinity and femininity were seemingly ignored. The flapper was making an appeal to authority and was being attached to the impending "demoralization" of the country.&lt;ref name="Yellis 1969 44–64" /&gt;

The Victorian American conception of sexuality and other roles of men and women in society and to one another were being challenged. Modern clothing was lighter and more flexible, better suiting the modern woman such as the flapper who wanted to engage in active sport. Women were now becoming more assertive and less willing to keep the home fires burning. The flappers' costume was seen as sexual and raised deeper questions of the behavior and values it symbolized.&lt;ref name="Yellis 1969 44–64" /&gt;

== End of the flapper era ==
The flapper lifestyle and look disappeared in America after the [[Wall Street Crash]] and the following [[Great Depression]]. The high-spirited attitude and [[hedonism]] were less acceptable during the economic hardships of the 1930s. While hemlines rose, numerous states took action, making laws that restricted women to wear skirts with hemlines no shorter than three inches above the ankle. The ever-popular bobbed haircut was the cause for some women being fired from their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Flappers – Fashion, Costume, and Culture: Clothing, Headwear, Body Decorations, and Footwear through the Ages|url = http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/Modern-World-1919-1929/Flappers.html#ixzz3nJ0tToBB|website = www.fashionencyclopedia.com|accessdate = November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=October 2018}}

It wasn't until the Wall Street stock market crash of 1929 that the roaring '20s era of glitz and glamour came to an end, and with it, the flapper dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Stock Market Crash of 1929 {{!}}|url = http://www.thebubblebubble.com/1929-crash/|website = www.thebubblebubble.com|accessdate = November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to afford the latest trends and lifestyle, the once-vibrant flapper women returned to their dropped hemlines. A sudden serious tone washed over the public with the appearance of The Great Depression. Transitioning into the '30s was no easy task. Campaigns such as the "Make do and Mend" slogan were becoming prevalent to ensure there was no overconsumption throughout society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Women's Fashion in War Work|url = http://www.forgeofinnovation.org/Springfield_Armory_1892-1945/Themes/People/Women/World_War_II/Fashion_in_War_Work/index.html|website = www.forgeofinnovation.org|accessdate = November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabric choices were among the many items to be cut back during this poverty-stricken time. Artificial fabrics were used instead of elegant fabrics such as silk, which were so popular in the early 1900s. No longer were party dresses adorned with decorative embellishments or made brightly colored. Instead, women headed to work to take over roles of men at war. The physically demanding jobs called for the creation and social acceptance of women's pants in society. Although the era of the flapper had vanished almost overnight, its symbol for women's liberation would live on. No longer would a woman have to be a homemaker. The freedom to choose her role in society had been created. Even though many opposed the radical era, one can see how the flapper dress helped bridge a gap between genders in society, ultimately leading in the direction of women's rights.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

By 1934 the short-haired, short-skirted flapper look had completely disappeared and what we now consider to be typical 1930s fashion had taken over.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Moore was one of the [[National Endowment for the Arts|NEA]]-funded artists targeted by [[Jesse Helms]] and the [[GAO]] (General Accounting Office) in the early 1990s for creating art that was labeled "obscene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dubin |first=S. |title=Arresting Images: Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions |publisher=Routledge, 1994. pg.149 {{ISBN|978-0415908931}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was featured in the 1988 cult film ''[[Mondo New York]]'', which chronicled the leading performance artists of that period.

==Life and career==
Moore was born with [[cerebral palsy]], could not walk or talk, and communicated using a laser-pointer and a board of letters, numbers, and commonly used words. Using his pointer, he wrote books, directed plays, directed, acted in and edited films, and regularly gave poetry readings. Moore played piano, sang in ensemble music jams, and led bands in hard core [[Punk rock|punk]] clubs all along the [[West Coast of the United States]] until his death. He also produced, and exhibited across the United States and Canada, a large collection of original oil and digital paintings.

Moore was  known for his long (5–48 hours) ritualistic performances with audience participation, nudity, and eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dubin |first=S. |title=Arresting Images: Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions |publisher=Routledge, 1994. pg.155 {{ISBN|978-0415908931}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; His  writings on performance,&lt;ref name="South East Magazine 1989"/&gt; art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Kaplan |editor-first1=Rachel  |editor-last2=Hennessy |editor-first2=Keith |title=More Out Than In: Notes on sex, art &amp; community |publisher=Abundant Fuck Publications |date=1995 |isbn=978-1881430513}}&lt;/ref&gt; life,&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Frank.

Moore coined the word "eroplay" to describe physical play between adults released from the linear goals of sex and orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Steven |title=''Movie Stars and Sensuous Scars: Essays on the Journey from Disability Shame to Disability Pride'' |publisher=iUniverse, Inc., 2003. pgs. 130-133   {{ISBN|978-0595288939}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; He explored this and similar concepts in performance and ritual as a way for people to connect on a deeper level beyond the social and cultural expectations and limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burch |first=S. |title=''Encyclopedia of American Disability History'' |publisher=Facts on File, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0816070305}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Moore first came to be known in the 1970s as the creator of the popular [[cabaret]] show, the "Outrageous Beauty Revue". In the 1980s Moore attended the [[San Francisco Art Institute]] where he earned his M.F.A. in Performance/Video in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frank Moore's Resume|url=http://www.eroplay.com/Cave/resume.html|website=Eroplay.com|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this school Moore discovered that the work that he had been doing for over a decade was called performance art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Frank|title=Sol Divus (aka Michael Peppe) - Frank Moore's Shaman's Den|url=https://vimeo.com/197309142|website=Vimeo|accessdate=7 July 2017}} (2:24:20-2:24:50)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 he was voted Best Performance Artist by the ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]''. In the early 1990s Moore was targeted by Senator [[Jesse Helms]].&lt;ref name="Carr, C 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carr |first=C. |title=The Fiery Furnace: Performance in the '80s, War in the '90s |publisher=''TDR: The Drama Review'', Volume 49, Number 1 (T 185), Spring 2005.  Pgs. 19-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1991 to 1999 Moore published and edited the underground zine ''The Cherotic (r)Evolutionary''.&lt;ref name="Sant 2011. pg. 105"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sant |first=Toni |title=''Franklin Furnace and the Spirit of the Avant-Garde: A History of the Future'' |publisher=Intellect Ltd, 2011. pg. 105 {{ISBN|978-1841503714}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his books, ''Cherotic Magic'', ''Art of a Shaman'', ''Chapped Lap'',''Skin Passion'' and numerous other self-published pieces, Moore was widely published in various art and other periodicals. In artist Pamela Kay Walker's book, ''Moving Over the Edge,'' Moore is one of the artists featured as having "greatly impacted me and many people through their artistic expression and their lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Walker |first=Pamela Kay. |title=''Moving Over the Edge: Artists with Disabilities Take the Leap'' |publisher= Michael Horton Media. Davis, California. pp. 54-69. (2005) {{ISBN|0-9771505-2-6}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore's award-winning video works have shown throughout North America, and in 2001 he began producing shows for Berkeley's [[public access]] channel, Berkeley Community Media, Channel 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burke |first=Stoney |title=''Weapon: Mouth  Adventures in the Free Speech Zone'' |publisher=Regent Press, 2014. pg. 192. {{ISBN|978-1587902727}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; His shows continue to play several times each week.

In 2011, Moore launched his online performance and video retrospective on [[Vimeo]]. At the same time he created the ''EROART'' group featuring videos by eroart artists from across the world.

Frank Moore's ''Web of All Possibilities'' features a growing archive of his audio, video, visual and written work, as well as the work of other artists. He founded Love Underground Visionary Revolution (LUVeR) in 1999, a webstation combining live streaming and on-demand libraries of audio and video programming,&lt;ref name="Sant 2011. pg. 105"/&gt; described by Moore as a "non-corporate, d.i.y., totally uncensored, noncommercial, nonprofit internet-only communal collective with 24-hour 'live' programming (by amazing people) with 'no-limits' content." LUVeR ran until 2012.

In 2006, Moore announced his candidacy for the 2008 election for President of the United States.&lt;ref name="Wikinews"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews_interviews_Frank_Moore,_independent_candidate_for_US_President |newspaper=[[Wikinews]] |title=Wikinews_interviews_Frank_Moore,_independent_candidate_for_US_President|date=1 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a qualified [[write-in]] candidate in 25 states.  His campaign was responsible for reforming the write-in candidate qualifications and procedures in many states. His platform videos are available on [[YouTube]].

Moore also hosted his regular internet show, ''Frank Moore's Shaman's Den''. Moore describes it as a show that "will arouse, inspire, move, threaten you, not with sound bites, but with a two-hour (usually longer) feast of live streaming video.  You might get an in-studio concert of bands from around the world...or poetry reading...or an in-depth conversation about politics, art, music, and LIFE with extremely dangerous people!  But then you may see beautiful women naked dancing erotically.  You never know, because you are in ''The Shaman's Den'' with Frank Moore." Video and audio archives of all of these ''Shaman's Den'' shows are available online.

Frank Moore died of pneumonia on October 14, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/iconic-bay-area-performance-artist-frank-moore-dies-tribute-planned-in-oakland/Content?oid=2608053  |title=Iconic Bay Area performance artist Frank Moore dies; tribute planned in Oakland |last=Echavaria |first=Vince |publisher=San Francisco Examiner  10/21/13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed regularly in the San Francisco Bay Area up until his death.

==Influence and Legacy==
Performance artist [[Annie Sprinkle]] considers Moore one of her teachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sprinkle |first=A. |title=''Post-porn modernist: my 25 years as a multimedia whore'' |publisher=Cleis Press, 1998. {{ISBN|1-57344-039-6}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Moore performed with a host of performance and underground punk figures since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boulware |first1=Jack |last2=Tudor |first2=Silke |title=''Gimme Something Better: The Profound, Progressive, and Occasionally Pointless History of Bay Area Punk from Dead Kennedys to Green Day'' |publisher=Penguin Books, 2009. pg. 306 {{ISBN|978-0143113805}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Barbara Smith, Linda Sibio, [[The Feederz]], and [[Dirk Dirksen]] - The Pope of Punk.

Frank Moore's life and art are now being documented in a web video series called ''Let Me Be Frank''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.traileraddict.com/let-me-be-frank-2016/trailer  |title=Trailer for ''Let Me Be Frank'' |website=on TrailerAddict.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2017, Frank Moore's work is now being archived at the [[Bancroft Library]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frank Moore archives – 1st delivery to UCB Bancroft Library made today! |url=http://eroplay.org/?p=46 |website=The Frank Moore Archives |accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is titled “Frank Moore papers, approximately 1970-2013.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frank Moore Papers|url=https://oac.cdlib.org/search?style=oac4;ff=0;institution=UC%20Berkeley::Bancroft%20Library;query=frank%20moore;idT=UCb24074536x|website=Online Archive of California|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the [[Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive]] (BAMPFA) accepted two of Frank’s oil paintings into their permanent collection:  ''Mariah'' (1977), and ''Patti Smith'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BAMPFA Art Collection Search – Mariah|url=https://webapps.cspace.berkeley.edu/bampfa/search/search/?maxresults=1&amp;displayType=full&amp;idnumber=2018.16.2|website=Berkeley.edu|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BAMPFA Art Collection Search – Patti Smith|url=https://webapps.cspace.berkeley.edu/bampfa/search/search/?maxresults=1&amp;displayType=full&amp;idnumber=2018.16.1|website=Berkeley.edu|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3714">'''''History of Italian Art of the Twentieth Century''''' (Storia dell'arte italiana del '900) is an art encyclopedia written between 1981 and 2010 by critic and art historian [[Giorgio Di Genova]] published by Edizioni Bora in [[Bologna]].

== Description ==
The encyclopedia, which discusses both [[painting]] and [[sculpture]], traces the critical profiles of artists who have characterized twentieth century [[Italian art]]. The content is organized on a biographical basis, although the text is composed of historical-themed chapters and not individual entries. The distribution of content between the various volumes takes place on a generational basis: each volume deals with facts and personalities that have characterized the different generations of artists, divided by decades: from the "Historical Masters generation" (of which the personalities born in the course Of the nineteenth century but still active in the twentieth century) comes the "forties generation" (of which artists born between 1940 and 1949). This entirely peculiar setting has the advantage of creating in the vast biographical panorama the analyzed criteria for distinguishing and organizing objective and controlled content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=TfN73TARh0sC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=di+genova+%22storia+dell'arte+italiana+del+'900%22&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCTgKahUKEwj7h7uyiuzGAhUCjnIKHTGWDXk#v=onepage&amp;q=di%20genova%20%22storia%20dell'arte%20italiana%20del%20'900%22&amp;f=false|title=Come studiare l'arte contemporanea|last=Crispolti|first=Enrico|date=2010|publisher=Donzelli Editore|isbn=9788860363749|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drafting ==
In [[Geneva]], at the beginning of the eighties, Genoa began writing the contents of those which later became volumes 4, 5 and 6 on three exhibitions on Italian artists born in the twenties (1981), ten years (1982) and First decade (1985) of the twentieth century. Since 1993, publisher Bora of Bologna has started publishing encyclopedia volumes.

In 1999 Di Genova was among the founders of MAGI '900, the museum in Pieve di Cento, which aims to set up an anthological collection of 20th century Italian art, becoming the museum's equivalent to the encyclopedic contents of the ''History of Art.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=zGbK_iD0ZMsC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=di+genova+%22storia+dell'arte+italiana+del+'900%22&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwATgKahUKEwj7h7uyiuzGAhUCjnIKHTGWDXk#v=onepage&amp;q=di%20genova%20%22storia%20dell'arte%20italiana%20del%20'900%22&amp;f=false|title=Cultura e competitività.

'''''Jacob's Ladder''''' is a 1990 American [[psychological horror]] film directed by [[Adrian Lyne]], produced by [[Alan Marshall (producer)|Alan Marshall]], written by [[Bruce Joel Rubin]] and starring [[Tim Robbins]], [[Elizabeth Peña]], and [[Danny Aiello]]. The film's protagonist, Jacob, is a [[Vietnam veteran]] whose experiences prior to and during the war result in strange, fragmentary visions and bizarre hallucinations that continue to haunt him. As his ordeal worsens, Jacob desperately attempts to figure out the truth.

''Jacob's Ladder'' was made by [[Carolco Pictures]] ten years after being written by Rubin. It drew from several inspirations for its story and effects, including the short film ''[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (film)|An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]'' and the paintings of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]. Though only moderately successful upon release, the film garnered a [[Cult film|cult following]] and became a source of influence for various other works such as the horror video game franchise ''[[Silent Hill]]''. A remake, also titled ''[[Jacob's Ladder (2019 film)|Jacob's Ladder]]'', is currently in production for a planned 2019 release.

==Plot==
On 6&amp;nbsp;October 1971, an American [[combat medic]], Jacob Singer, is with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Air Cavalry Division]], deployed in a village in Vietnam's [[Mekong Delta]], when his close-knit unit comes under sudden attack. As many of Jacob's comrades are killed or wounded, others exhibit abnormal behavior with some suffering [[catatonia]], convulsions, and seizures. Jacob flees into the jungle, only to be bayoneted by an unseen assailant.

Jacob awakens in the [[New York City Subway]], where an inexplicably locked subway station exit results in him almost being hit by a train. The year is 1975, he works as a postal clerk, and lives in a rundown apartment in [[Brooklyn]] with his girlfriend, Jezzie. Jacob misses his old family and experiences visions of them, especially the youngest of his sons, Gabe, who had died in an accident before the war. He is increasingly beset by disturbing experiences and apparitions, including glimpses of faceless vibrating figures, and narrowly escapes being run over by a pursuing car. At a party thrown by friends, he appears to witness an enormous creature penetrating Jezzie before he collapses with a dangerous fever. First-person perspective apparent [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] to his time in Vietnam show Jacob, badly wounded, being discovered by American soldiers before being evacuated under fire in a helicopter.

One of Jacob's former platoon mates, Paul, contacts him to reveal he is suffering from similar experiences but is immediately killed when his car explodes. Commiserating after the funeral, other surviving members of the platoon confess that they have all been experiencing horrifying hallucinations. Believing that they are suffering the effects of a military experiment performed on them without their knowledge or consent, they hire a lawyer to investigate. However the lawyer quits the case after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons. Jacob's comrades soon back down while Jacob suspects they have been threatened into doing so. He is abducted by suited men who try to intimidate him. Jacob fights them and escapes but is injured and nearly paralyzed in the process. He is taken to a nightmarish hospital, where he is told he has been killed and this is home, but his [[chiropractor]] friend Louis comes to his rescue and heals him. Louis quotes the 14th-century [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]], [[Meister Eckhart]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eckhart saw [[Hell]] too. He said: "The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they're not punishing you", he said. "They're freeing your soul. So, if you're frightened of dying and ... you're holding on, you'll see [[devil]]s tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, then the devils are really [[angel]]s, freeing you from the earth."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jacob is approached by a distressed man who was seen treating his wound in a [[Medical evacuation|medevac]] helicopter and who also dragged him away from Paul's burning car. Introducing himself as Michael Newman, he tells a story of having been a chemist with [[Chemical Corps|the Army's chemical warfare division]] where he designed a drug he called the Ladder, which when ingested massively increased aggression. To test its effectiveness, a dose was secretly given to Jacob's unit before the battle, causing some of them to turn on each other in a homicidal frenzy. Michael's revelation triggers a vision of his wounding in Vietnam, in which he sees that his attacker was a fellow American soldier. Jacob returns to his family's home, where he finds Gabe, who takes him by the hand and leads him up the staircase into a bright light. In a [[triage]] tent in 1971, military doctors declare Jacob dead.

{{quote box|quote=The horror of the movie would be in the revelation that hope is hell's final torment, that life is a dream that ends over and over with the final truth: that life was never real, that we are all creatures trapped in eternal suffering and damnation.|source=–[[Bruce Joel Rubin]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul Meehan, ''Horror Noir: Where Cinema's Dark Sisters Meet'', McFarland, 2011 (p.259).&lt;/ref&gt;|width=30%}}

The film's title refers to the Biblical story of [[Jacob's Ladder]], or the dream of a meeting place between [[Heaven]] and Earth ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 28:12). Its little-known alternate title is ''Dante's Inferno'', in a reference to ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]].&lt;ref&gt;John Flowers, Paul Frizler, ''Psychotherapists on Film, 1899-1999: A Worldwide Guide to Over 5000 Films, Volume 1'', McFarland, 2004 (p.309).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Jaye Smith, ''Inner Drives'', Michael Wiese Productions, 2005 (p.217).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric G. Wilson, ''Secret Cinema: Gnostic Vision in Film'', Bloomsbury, 2006 (p.123).&lt;/ref&gt; Screenwriter and co-producer [[Bruce Joel Rubin]] perceived the film as a modern interpretation of the ''[[Bardo Thodol|Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State]]'', the [[Tibet]]an Book of the Dead.&lt;ref name="st"&gt;{{cite news | title = Adrian Lyne Met A Metaphysical Challenge | first = John | last = Hartl | url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19901101&amp;slug=1101695 | work = [[The Seattle Times]] | date = 1990-11-01 | accessdate = 2010-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = FILM; Up 'Jacob's Ladder' And Into the Hell Of a Veteran's Psyche | first = Tim | last = Golden | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/28/arts/film-up-jacob-s-ladder-and-into-the-hell-of-a-veteran-s-psyche.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1990-10-28 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin said: "The inspiration in a sense is my entire spiritual upbringing. Once you have a [[Buddhist meditation|meditative life]] you start to see that the world is really far different than what it appears to be. What appears to be finite is really couched in the infinite, and the infinite imbues everything in our lives."&lt;ref&gt;''Tricycle: The Buddhist Review - Volume 1'', Buddhist Ray, 1991 (p.77).&lt;/ref&gt; Before writing his scripts for ''Jacob's Ladder'' and ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', which too was released in 1990, the Jewish-born Rubin spent two years in a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] monastery in Nepal;&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrol Lee Fry, ''Cinema of the Occult: New Age, Satanism, Wicca, and Spiritualism in Film'', Associated University Presse, 2008 (p.77).&lt;/ref&gt; previously, he has also written [[afterlife]]-themed ''[[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]]'' and ''[[Deadly Friend]]''.

Rubin's work on ''Jacob's Ladder'' began in 1980, sparked by his nightmare in which he dreamt about being trapped in a subway. For several years, Rubin tried to sell the script, without success; [[Thom Mount]] of [[Universal Pictures]] said he "loved it, but it was not for his studio". Directors [[Michael Apted]], [[Sidney Lumet]] and [[Ridley Scott]] all expressed an interest in making the film, but still no major studio was ready to invest in Rubin's "too [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]" stories as "Hollywood does not make [[List of ghost films|ghost movies]]". Eventually, after ''Deadly Friend'' was filmed by [[Wes Craven]] in 1986, Rubin's screenplays for both ''Jacob's Ladder'' and ''Ghost'' were picked by [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref name="st" /&gt; In 1988,&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; [[Adrian Lyne]], who described Rubin's work as "certainly one of the best scripts I've ever read", decided then to direct it instead of an adaptation of ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' as he had originally planned (incidentally, [[Tom Hanks]], an actor originally considered by Lyne for the role of Jacob, ended up starring in ''Bonfire''). The ownership and policy changes at Paramount resulted in the cancellation of the project; the executives had doubts about the film's ending and the scenes taking place in Vietnam. The [[independent film]] studio [[Carolco Pictures]] decided to take over the production of ''Jacob's Ladder'', giving Lyne a greater creative control&lt;ref name="st" /&gt; and a budget of $25 million.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Rubin became the film's co-producer, along with [[Mario Kassar]], [[Alan Marshall (producer)|Alan Marshall]] and [[Andrew G. Vajna]].

{{quote box|quote=I can see why people didn't want to make it for so long. It reads like a novel, and it's very intimidating because it's written so descriptively. Bruce had these very literal images of heaven and hell that I didn't know how to bring off. How do you introduce a character with horns?|source=–[[Adrian Lyne]]&lt;ref name=st/&gt;|width=30%}}

Lyne, who downplayed Rubin's "intimidating" [[Old Testament]] themes,&lt;ref name="after"&gt;Tom Ruffles, ''Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife'', McFarland, 2004 (p.192).&lt;/ref&gt; said that he prepared for making the film by watching "endless" documentary films about the war in Vietnam and reading "countless" chronicles of [[near-death experience]]s.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; The film's plot device of a long period of [[Time perception|subjective time]] passing in an instant has been explored by several authors. A particularly strong inspiration for both Rubin and Lyne was [[Robert Enrico]]'s 1962 short film ''[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (film)|An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]'',&lt;ref name="rubin"&gt;Bruce Joel Rubin, ''Jacob's Ladder'', Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; one of Lyne's favourite movies,&lt;ref name="st" /&gt; which was in turn based on [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s 1890 short story [[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge|of the same title]].

Cast in the role of Jacob, [[Tim Robbins]] said the film presented for him "a great opportunity to go in a different direction. I love doing comedy, but I know I can do other things as well."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; The film's military advisor was Vietnam veteran Captain [[Dale Dye]],&lt;ref&gt;Almar Haflidason, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/10/15/dale_dye_2001_2_interview.shtml Dale Dye: Part 2 - Stop Whining at Me!], BBC, October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; who provided a five-day [[Recruit training|boot camp]] military training for the actors playing soldiers in the Vietnam storyline (including Robbins, [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]], [[Eriq La Salle]] and [[Ving Rhames]]). The war scenes were filmed in the [[Puerto Rico]] area of [[Vega Baja]], featuring the [[UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1]] helicopters provided by the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].

All of the film's special effect sequences were filmed in camera, with no use of post production effects. In several scenes of ''Jacob's Ladder'', Lyne used a [[body horror]] technique in which an actor is recorded shaking his head around at a low [[frame rate]], resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he was inspired by the art of the painter [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] when developing the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.widerscreenings.com/jacobsladder.html |title=Jacob's Ladder |publisher=Widerscreenings.com |date=|accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to [[thalidomide]] deformities to achieve a greater shock effect.&lt;ref name="rubin" /&gt; After many heated arguments,&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist [[H. R. Giger]] and the photographers [[Diane Arbus]] and [[Joel-Peter Witkin]] for inspiration; another influence came from the [[Brothers Quay]]'s 1986 [[stop motion]] short film ''[[Street of Crocodiles]]''.

{{quote box|quote=Vietnam was really a means to an end. It was a plot device rather than something we were trying to make a huge issue of.|source=–[[Alan Marshall (producer)|Alan Marshall]]&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;|width=30%}}

In the film, Jacob is told by Michael that the horrific events he experienced on his final day in Vietnam were the product of an experimental drug called "the Ladder", which was used on troops without their knowledge. At the end of the film, a message is displayed saying that reports of testing of BZ, [[NATO]] code for a [[deliriant]] and [[hallucinogen]] known as [[3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate|3-quinuclidinyl benzilate]], on U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War were denied by the [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]]. Lyne said a part of the inspiration for this motif was [[Martin A. Lee]]'s book ''[[Acid Dreams: The CIA, LSD and Sixties Rebellion]]'', but noted that "nothing in the book suggests that the drug BZ — a super-hallucinogen that has a tendency to elicit [[Mania|maniac behavior]] — was used on U.S. troops."&lt;ref name="st" /&gt;

According to Lyne's audio commentary, [[test screening]]s indicated that the initial version of the film was overwhelming for the audience. In response, about 20 minutes of disturbing scenes, mostly from the last third of the film, were removed from the final cut.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film took the number one spot at the weekend [[box office]] in North America, garnering ticket sales of $7.5 million from 1,052 screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-05/entertainment/ca-3119_1_ticket-sales |title='Jacob's Ladder' Climbs to Top of Ticket Sales. - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2000-08-17 |accessdate=2013-06-28 |first=Pat H. |last=Broeske}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the attendance dropped fast and its overall domestic box office result was only $26,118,851.&lt;ref name="mojo" /&gt;

===Critical reception===
According to aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 69% of reviews of the film have been positive based on 61 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jacobs_ladder/ | title = Jacob's Ladder (1990) | publisher = ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' | accessdate = 2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C-" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote that watching it left him "reeling with turmoil and confusion, with feelings of sadness and despair," and called it a "thoroughly painful and depressing experience — but, it must be said, one that has been powerfully written, directed and acted." He awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19901102/REVIEWS/11020301/1023 | title = Jacob's Ladder | last = Ebert | first = Roger | date = 1990-11-02 | publisher = ''Rogerebert.suntimes.com'' | accessdate = 2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that this "slick, riveting, viscerally scary film about what in other hands would be a decidedly unsalable subject, namely [[death]]," is "both quaint and devastating."&lt;ref&gt;Janet Maslin, [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE7D8143CF931A35752C1A966958260 Movie Review - Jacob s Ladder - Review/Film; It's Scary, Yes, and Death Has a Role], ''The New York Times'', November 2, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Desson Thomson]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' felt disappointed with the film that is "ultimately flat on its [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] face, the victim of too many fake-art sequences."&lt;ref&gt;Desson Howe, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/jacobsladderrhowe_a0b2b5.htm 'Jacob's Ladder' (R)], ''Washington Post'', November 02, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that "''Jacob's Ladder'' is so 'dark' it sucks Robbins right down with it. By the time Jacob is being strapped to a bed and wheeled down a hospital corridor strewn with bloody limbs, it's hard to care whether the [[Orwellian]] image is a hallucination or not. You just want out."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Gleiberman, [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318521,00.html Jacob's Ladder (1990)], EW.com, Nov 02, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Newman]] called the film "effectively the blunt remake" of ''[[Carnival of Souls]]''.&lt;ref name="after" /&gt;

According to [[IGN]]'s review of the DVD release in 2004, "After movies like ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]'', it may not pack the same subtle horror for today's audiences it did when it was first released, but it's still a great film."&lt;ref name="dvd"&gt;Mike Drucker, [http://uk.ign.com/articles/2004/11/08/jacobs-ladder Jacob's Ladder: The living nightmare of a movie has a pretty decent DVD.], IGN, November 8, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; IGN's review of ''Jacob's Ladder''{{'}}s 2010 Blu-ray release called it is "an emotionally poignant, creepy horror masterpiece."&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; According to ''[[Slant Magazine]]'', ''Jacob's Ladder'' is "a bizarrely cohesive hybrid of war movie, character study, [[art film]], and horror flick" and "the very act of watching the film is so emotionally draining that the viewer leaves the film feeling worked-in; the thought of repeat viewings is daunting yet insatiable."&lt;ref name="br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/jacobs-ladder/1807 |title=Jacob's Ladder &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;#124;&lt;/nowiki&gt; DVD Review |publisher=Slant Magazine |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Kenneth Muir]] called the film's nightmarish hospital scene "one of the most terrifying moments in all of 1990s horror cinema." Muir further wrote: "In its musings about death, about the end we all fear'', Jacob's Ladder'' proves a deeply affecting and meaningful motion picture. After a screening, you'll immediately want to hug the people you love and then go outside and breathe the fresh air, or otherwise affirm your very existence."&lt;ref&gt;John Kenneth Muir, ''Horror Films of the 1990s'', McFarland, 2011 (p.105).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin's script was included on the list of "Hollywood's ten best unproduced screenplays" by ''American Film'' magazine in 1983.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; In 1991, ''Jacob's Ladder'' was nominated at [[Horror Hall of Fame]] II for best horror film, losing to ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''. The film was also featured in [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s 2004 documentary miniseries ''[[The 100 Scariest Movie Moments]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030070540/http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml |archivedate=2007-10-30 |title=The 100 Scariest Movie Moments: 100 Scariest Moments in Movie History - Official Bravo TV Site |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2009 book ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]''. In 2013, the [[Jacob Burns Film Center]] Projectionist Andrew Robinson chose it as his favourite scary movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.burnsfilmcenter.org/halloween-countdown-day-8-jacobs-ladder/ |title=Halloween Countdown – Day 8: Jacob's Ladder » Jacob Burns Film Center Blog |publisher=Blog.burnsfilmcenter.org |date=2013-10-26 |accessdate=2014-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728200336/http://blog.burnsfilmcenter.org/halloween-countdown-day-8-jacobs-ladder/ |archivedate=July 28, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Jacob's Ladder'' greatly inspired the horror franchise ''[[Silent Hill]]'',&lt;ref&gt;John Gaudiosi, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngaudiosi/2012/11/02/resident-evil-and-silent-hill-producer-samuel-hadida-talks-wolfenstein-and-onimusha-movies/ Resident Evil And Silent Hill Producer Samuel Hadida Talks Wolfenstein And Onimusha Movies],  Forbes, 11/02/2012&lt;/ref&gt; including the video games ''[[Silent Hill (video game)|Silent Hill]]'' (1999),&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Perron, ''Silent Hill: The Terror Engine'', University of Michigan Press, 2012 (p. 55-56).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Silent Hill 2]]'' (2001),&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.ign.com/articles/2001/08/17/interview-with-silent-hill-2s-artist-takayoshi-sato Interview with Silent Hill 2&amp;#039,s Artist Takayoshi Sato], IGN, August 17, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Silent Hill 3]]'' (2003),&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.ign.com/articles/2002/06/12/silent-hill-3-interview Silent Hill 3 Interview], IGN, June 12, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Silent Hill 4: The Room]]'' (2004),&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A3066879| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227080553/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A3066879| archivedate = 2007-12-27| title = Silent Hill 4: The Room| author = Daniel Etherington| work = [[bbc.co.uk]]| date = 2004-10-01| accessdate = 2007-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Silent Hill: Homecoming]]'' (2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grayson |first=Vincent |url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/52765/silent-hill-5-interview-jasons |title=Silent Hill 5 Interview: Jason's Philosophy, Jacob's Ladder, and Pyramid Head |publisher=Shacknews.com |date=|accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the series' 2006 [[Silent Hill (film)|film adaptation]] by [[Christophe Gans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/interview/219 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328090017/http://bloody-disgusting.com/interview/219 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-03-28 |title=Interview Silent Hill: Director Christophe Gans |publisher=Bloody Disgusting |date=|accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's influence on their works was recognised by [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], writer of the 2011 TV series ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/03/jessica-lange-the-name-game_n_2402373.html Jessica Lange Sings 'The Name Game': 'American Horror Story: Asylum' Goes Musical], HUFFPOST TV, 01/03/2013&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Shinji Mikami]], director of the 2014 video game ''[[The Evil Within]]''.&lt;ref name=ign2&gt;Lucy O'Brien, [http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/05/06/the-movie-every-survival-horror-fan-should-watch "Am I dying, Louie?"], IGN, May 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Manners]] prepared for directing ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Grotesque (The X-Files)|Grotesque]]" by listening to the music from ''Jacob's Ladder''.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lowry, ''The Truth is Out There: The Official Guide to the X-Files'', Harper Prism, 1995 (p.158).&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for the 2010 song "[[Nightmare (Avenged Sevenfold song)|Nightmare]]" by [[Avenged Sevenfold]] is a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the famous hospital scene from the film, chosen because the band's deceased drummer [[The Rev]] was a fan of the film.

''Jacob's Ladder'' as a film is directly referred to in ''Silent Hill 2'' and especially ''Silent Hill 3''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/behind-mysteries-of-silent-hill |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130219221845/http://www.1up.com/features/behind-mysteries-of-silent-hill |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-19 |title=Behind the Many Mysteries of Silent Hill from |publisher=1UP.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other references include the 2002 ''[[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Night Route]]", the 2005 film ''[[Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', and the 2010 ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[The Squirt and the Whale]]".

[[Claytown Troupe]] used a [[Sample (music)|sample]] of Michael's quote 'It's a fast trip ... ' at the beginning of the track "Rainbow's Edge" in the 1991 album ''Out There''. [[UNKLE]] sampled dialogue from the film in their 1998 "[[Rabbit in Your Headlights]]" and again in 2003 in "Inside". [[VNV Nation]]'s track "Forsaken" from the 1998  album ''[[Praise the Fallen]]'' ends with the quotation from Eckhart. "Devils" from [[IVardensphere]]'s 2011 album ''APOK'' begins with the same quotation. A sample of Jacob's cry 'Stop it, you're killing me!' is used in "Next in Line" in [[Nevermore]]'s 1996 album ''[[The Politics of Ecstasy (album)|The Politics of Ecstasy]]''.  Terminal Sect extensively sampled the film for their track "Where Angels Fall".

The film's possible influence can be arguably seen in many other works ranging from [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s 1999 hit psychological horror film ''[[The Sixth Sense]]''&lt;ref&gt;Charles Derry, ''Dark Dreams 2.0: A Psychological History of the Modern Horror Film from the 1950s to the 21st Century'', McFarland, 2009 (p.223).&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Peter Arnett]]'s controversial 1998 [[CNN]] report "Valley of Death" about the 1970 [[Operation Tailwind]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Lembcke, ''CNN's Tailwind Tale: Inside Vietnam's Last Great Myth'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003 (p.77).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Millar]] of ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' wrote that [[Giuseppe Tornatore]]'s 1994 psychological thriller ''[[A Pure Formality]]'' uses the plot device of ''Jacob's Ladder'' mixed with several other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Millar, [http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1995_1300653/pure-formality-so-pretentious-is-hurts.html 'Pure Formality' so pretentious is hurts], ''Houston Chronicle'', 10/06/1995&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'', [[Massy Tadjedin]]'s 2005 psychological thriller ''[[The Jacket]]'' "is a film for those who don't remember ''Jacob's Ladder'', perhaps for someone like Jacob himself", as it "resembles ''Jacob's Ladder'' too much for its own good".&lt;ref&gt;Brian W. Fairbanks, ''I Saw That Movie, Too: Selected Film Reviews'', 2005 (p.201).&lt;/ref&gt; [[PopMatters]] called [[Michael Hurst]]'s 2006 horror film ''[[Room 6]]'' a "''Jacob's Ladder'' lift".&lt;ref&gt;Bill Gibron, [http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/room-6/ Room 6], PopMatters, 8 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Deahr’s childhood training began in Arlington Heights, IL training primarily in jazz, ballet and hip hop. Upon earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology with a minor in dance from [[Illinois Wesleyan University]], her early career continued as a trainee scholarship recipient of the Joel Hall Dance Center in [[Chicago]], IL&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iwu.edu/magazine/2017/spring/deahr-dance.html "Guest choreographer Jessica Deahr ’04 stretches dance students to their limits." IWU Magazine 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In addition to teaching and modeling, as a professional dancer Deahr worked as a company member of James Morrow’s “Instruments of Movement” from 2007-2009 while guest performing for [[Harrison McEldowney]] and Frank Chaves among others. Combining both her creative range and commercial interests, Deahr performed for artists [[Nelly]], [[Vanilla Ice]], [[Jump Smokers]] and [[DJ Pauly D]] while contracting with [[Royal Caribbean International]] as both a dancer and ariel artist, performing domestically as well as across Europe, Asia and South America&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20130530/entlife/705319989/ "Suburban Choreographer Didn't Expect a Career in Dance" Daily Herald 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Chicago Dance Crash==
Deahr’s first work with the Chicago-based contemporary company, [[Chicago Dance Crash]], was a supporting role in the 2007 production of ''Tiger Prawn: The Mountain Mover''.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Almeida|first1=Fabrizio|title=Review: Tiger Prawn: The Mountain Mover/ Chicago Dance Crash|work=Newcity|date=July 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoted as remembering “I had a black sock over my head, was kind of in the background… didn’t care. I was just so excited to be part of something that seemed to fit. &lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/115537858 "History of Crash: 2001-2015" staff interviews]&lt;/ref&gt;,” she continued guest work with the organization until being promoted to a company position by artistic director Kyle Vincent Terry in 2009. 
[[File:Jessica Deahr Fantasma.png|thumb|Deahr rehearsing a site-specific work. Photo by Kelly Stachura]]

Having successfully freelanced as a choreographer and upon Terry’s retirement, Deahr was named the company’s resident choreographer at the end of 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nevin|first=Johnny|title=Dance Crash, Deahr and the Art of Connection|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johnny-nevin/dance-crash-deahr-art_b_2564568.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As Crash operated without a formal artistic director for its 2012, tenth anniversary season, Deahr directed and choreographed the season’s signature production, ''Gotham City'' (inspired by the setting of [[Batman]] comic lore), which was later recognized by the [[Chicago Tribune]] as one of Chicago’s 10 best productions performed that year&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-12-13/entertainment/ct-ae-1216-best-dance-20121213_1_hubbard-street-dance-chicago-harris-theater-gustavo-ramirez-sansano "Dances from 2012 that Linger in Memory" Chicago Tribune, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;. She was internally acknowledged as the company’s artistic director throughout the 2012 season, with her promotion publicly announced to the audience at the company’s final performance of the year on November 17th&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zweR-qq2YrY&amp;index=9&amp;list=PLZa1beqMe01Zx3Z1YPJUxLHMagXF58e_e "Announcing our new Artistic Director" Chicago Dance Crash  youtube channel]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Artistic Director ===
Deahr is both the youngest and first female artistic director in the history of the organization. 
"Yeah I think it was kind of cool because when a company gets a new artistic director they come from somewhere 'here they are, meet them.' So that was slightly terrifying but also kind of cool because I knew them so well. So was cool to come... with a vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/115537858 "History of Crash: 2001-2015" staff interviews]&lt;/ref&gt;" 

As artistic director, Deahr has most notably expanded Crash’s Chicago-based educational outreach arm&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbangateways.org/qa-with-chicago-dance-crash-promoting-art-for-all-from-schools-to-the-modern-wing/ "Q+A with Chicago Dance Crash: Promoting Art for All, from Schools to the Modern Wing" Urban Gateways 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; while taking the organization beyond the state of Illinois both nationally and internationally. Her full-length works including ''The Cotton Mouth Club,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zacher|first1=Scotty|title=Review: The Cotton Mouth Club (Chicago Dance Crash)|work=Chicago Theater Beat|date=May 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Evil &amp; Good''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/dance/ct-chicago-dance-crash-good-evil-ent-0711-20160710-column.html "Chicago Dance Crash plunges into ''Evil &amp; Good''" Chicago Tribune July 9, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;, and ''The Bricklayers of Oz''&lt;ref&gt;[https://dancermusic.com/chicago-dance-crash-and-the-bricklayers-of-oz/ "Chicago Dance Crash and the Bricklayers of Oz" DancerMusic.com July 27, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; (inspired by [[The Land of Oz]] books by [[L. Frank Baum]]) have received critical acclaim while seeing extended tours.

==Critical Reception &amp; Awards==
Consistently, Deahr's work has been well received by American midwest and national press, starting with her first professional work on Crash earning the "New Voice Award" from the 2011 Dance Chicago Festival as well as being unveiled to the national public as “brash, funky, bright and street friendly in style.” by the Chicago Tribune&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancechicago.com/documents/CRASHSIDSMITHREVIE.pdf "Chicago Dance Crash offers ''RadioStars''" SeeChicagoDance.com 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;. Taking an interest in Deahr's career, the [[Huffington Post]] noted in 2013 that “Deahr's versatility isn't at all an end in itself; it seems more to be her way of discovering an artistic expression that can go more places, because it's been more places. While many artists see an uncomfortable contradiction between artistic expression and audience approval, Deahr sees both parts of that apparent conflict with more clarity and in a more complete context. One of the secrets of Deahr's vision is that because she can see more of it, she can see right through it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johnny-nevin/dance-crash-deahr-art_b_2564568.html "Dance Crash, Deahr and the Art of Connection" The Huffington Post January 29, 2013] &lt;/ref&gt;” In 2017, [[Dance Magazine]] awarded her full-length work ''The Bricklayers of Oz'' as "The Most Inventive New Work of 2017"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Best of 2017|journal=Dance Magazine|date=December 2017|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] declared  “There is something about Jessica Deahr’s ingenious new hip-hop dance-theater piece that is so imaginative, so playfully revisionist, and so superbly realized by all the artists involved, that it feels like an instant classic all its own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/repaving-the-yellow-brick-road-in-ingenious-bricklayers-of-oz/ "Repaving the Yellow Brick Road in ingenious ''Bricklayers of Oz''" Chicago Sun-Times August 6, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;” Additionally, Deahr has been acknowledged as among the "Best in Dance" by the Chicago Tribune,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Sid|title=Sid Smith's Best in Dance 2012|work=The Chicago Tribune|date=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a "Top Artist" by Dance Magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whittenberg|first1=Zachary|title=Top Artists Confess their Guilty Pleasures|work=Dance Magazine|date=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as a featured artist in IWU Magazine&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iwu.edu/magazine/2017/spring/deahr-dance.html "Guest choreographer Jessica Deahr ’04 stretches dance students to their limits" IWU Magazine Spring, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[New York Times]] best-selling book "Dancers Among Us&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/29647160 "Dancers Among Us in Chicago - Sunrise at Oak St Beach" Vimeo]&lt;/ref&gt;."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5645">The '''Kiltubbrid Shield''' is an [[Iron Age]] wooden shield from [[Ireland]]. It was discovered during the 19th century in the [[townland]] and parish of [[Kiltubbrid]], [[County Leitrim]], Ireland. It is probably the only perfect article of its description found in Europe,{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=492}} and dates from the [[La Tène culture|late Celtic (La Tène)]] period.{{sfn|Ridgeway|1901|pp=478}}

==Description==
The Kiltubbrid shield is a remarkably well-preserved example of an ancient Irish wooden shield. It was discovered {{nobreak|in 1863}}, buried {{convert|3|m|1}} deep in a turf bog, at [[Kiltubbrid]] townland and just north of [[Lough Scur]].{{sfn|Coffey|1913|pp=75}} The shield is a perfect specimen, oval in shape, with a perfect central boss {{convert|7.6|cm|1}} high, and seven slightly raised concentric circles (ribs), plain on the reverse, with a handle, the whole carved out of one piece of wood.{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}}{{sfn|Drummon|1871|pp=218}}  The original measurements were {{convert|66|cm|1}} in height by {{convert|53|cm|1}} in width, with a thickness of {{convert|1.25|cm|1}}. Unlike ancient classic shields, through which the forearm was passed, the Irish wooden shield, grasped by the cross-piece underneath the umbo (boss), could be projected to full arm's length during battle.{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}} The wood was probably [[alder]].{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=492}}{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}}

Kiltubrid-Alder-wooden-shield-Ireland.png|2nd illustration
Kiltubrid-Alder-wooden-shield-Ireland2.png|3rd illustration
Kiltubrid Shield Illustration.png|4th illustration
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The shields was probably covered with leather, painted and decorated.{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=492}}{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}} The ribs show an indentation on one side, presenting a remarkable interruption in the symmetry of the ornament.  Shrinkage may have caused the indentation.{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}} MacAllister wondered if the indentation is a survival of the observation-notch which adorned shield edges in medieval time, or if this interruption of circular ornament reflected a widespread taboo and superstition against closed rings which prevailed at the time.{{sfn|MacAlliaster|1921|=p-171}}

==Etymology==
[[Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh]] stated in Ogygia (1685) that the Irish name for alder was Fearn, because "shields are made of it". The Irish word ' sciath,' i. e. shield, is more recently applied to a shallow wicker basket, of oval shape — sometimes called a skib — ' used for straining potatoes, and which closely resembles in size and form of the Kiltubbrid wooden shield.{{sfn|Coffey|1913|pp=75}}{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=490}}

==Purpose==
[[File:Irish Battle Scene Swords, Spears, and Shields.png|thumb|Irish Battle Scene Swords, Spears, and Shields]]
The toughness and density of the alder would, in itself, be a firm defence against the thrusts of swords, if not spears,{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=492}} but half-inch thick wooden shields would be useless against Roman javelins.{{sfn|Drummon|1871|pp=218}}

An illustration sculptured on a stone cross at [[Kells, County Meath]] evidently depicts a conflict between different tribes or cultures; one armed with long-handled spears and circular bossed-shields, the opposing warrior shields have no boss, and are armed with short swords, of a kind often found on [[crannog]]s and first adopted with the introduction of iron as a primary material for weapons of warfare.{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=467}}

'''Kongo ivories''' are some of the finest sculptural works produced by the people of the west-central Africa's Lower Congo region. In the [[Kongo Kingdom]], [[ivory]] was a precious commodity that was strictly controlled by chiefs and kings, who commissioned sculptors to produce fine ivory sculptures for their personal and courtly use. With the rise of the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic trade]], ivory became one of the most valuable African [[natural resources]] sought by Western industry. Eventually, Kongo ivory carvers produced works not only for indigenous leaders and elites but also for Europeans and other foreigners.&lt;ref name="Met Museum"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridges|first=Nichole N.|title=Kongo Ivories|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kong/hd_kong.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afro-Portuguese ivories==
Most of the earliest extant ivory carvings from sub-Saharan Africa were not made for African consumers.&lt;ref name="Ross 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Doran|title=Elephant : the animal and its ivory in African culture|year=1992|publisher=Fowler Museum of Cultural History, University of California|location=Los Angeles|isbn=0930741250|authorlink=Imagining Elephants: An Overview|editor=Doran Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Richly decorated oliphants, or side-blown horns, from the sixteenth century are among the earliest known of the Kongo Kingdom's royal commissions in ivory. Although made in the form of musical instruments to be used during court ceremonies, many such sculptures were likely given as gifts and made for sale to Portuguese elites, missionaries, and traders.&lt;ref name="Met Museum" /&gt; In the 1950s, historian [[William Buller Fagg|William Fagg]] coined the term “Afro-Portuguese ivories” to describe Kongo oliphants and other ivory sculptures from this period.&lt;ref name="Fagg 1958"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fagg|first=William|title=Afro-Portuguese Ivories|year=1958|publisher=Batchworth Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma George Ross, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/apiv/hd_apiv.htm "Afro-Portuguese Ivories"] ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number of Afro-Portuguese ivories are in the [[British Museum]], many of them made in [[Sierra Leone]] and Benin in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Carved+ivory+Sierra+Leone British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Carved+salt-cellar+Benin British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carved ivories for export==
About the middle of the nineteenth century, a new style of ivory carving developed in the area to meet the demand of the export trade along the [[Loango Kingdom|Loango Coast]] of west-central Africa. This style consisted of fine, detailed relief carving that depicts scenes of Kongo life.&lt;ref name=Siegmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes commonly portrayed in relief on the ivories capture the dynamic and cosmopolitan coastal activity related to the transatlantic trade.

Most carved Loango tusks are not longer than two to three feet because they were sourced from forest elephants, which are much smaller than the African savannah elephant. Full Loango tusk sculptures that were sculpted from the enormous tusks of savannah elephants are extremely rare; one notable example is now part of the [[Brooklyn Museum]]’s collection.

The '''Logan Medal of the Arts''' was an arts prize initiated in 1907 and associated with the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], the Frank G Logan family and the [[Society for Sanity in Art]].  From 1917 through 1940, 270 awards were given for contributions to American art.

The Medal was named for arts patron Frank Granger Logan, founder of the brokerage house of Logan &amp; Bryan, who served over 50 years on the board of the Chicago Art Institute.  He and his wife, Josephine Hancock Logan, administered the award consistent with their patronage of the [[Society for Sanity in Art]], which they founded in 1936, and the theme of her 1937 book ''Sanity in Art''.  The Logans strongly opposed all forms of modern art, including [[cubism]], [[surrealism]], and [[abstract expressionism]]. It was not unknown for the Society of Sanity in Art to award a prize (e.g. in 1938 to [[Rudolph F. Ingerle]]) in competition with the official award by the exhibition prize committee of a prize the Logans had already sponsored.

The Logans sponsored several prizes in their name. The Mr and Mrs Frank G Logan prize was awarded to a jury-selected exhibit at the American Paintings and Sculpture Exhibitions held in Chicago, and a similarly named prize was awarded to a local artist at the annual Chicago and Vicinity Exhibition for a selected exhibit. Frank G Logan prizes were also awarded at exhibitions of prints by the [[Chicago Society of Etchers]], the annual International Watercolor Exhibition and the annual International Lithography and Wood Engraving Exhibition, all held at the Chicago Art Institute. Logan prizes were also awarded by the Society for Sanity in Art at exhibitions in California. Recipients of these prizes are listed below.

The '''Marblehead Little Theatre''' is a [[community theatre]] in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts|Marblehead]], [[Massachusetts]], founded in 1956.

It is one of the oldest continually operating community theatres in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

{{coord|42|30|5.6|N|70|51|22.9|W|region:US|display=title}}

==History==

===The beginning===

One success in 1955, by members of the drama committee of the Marblehead Woman's Club, ignited the desire to tackle bigger and better things.
Encouraged by the response to a one-act play, ''The Charm Racquet'', the women decided to next produce a three-act play and then went one step bolder by deciding to form a community theatre group.

Marblehead Little Theatre's first full-scale production was Moss Hart's ''Light up the Sky''. While casting the show, it became evident that a much larger group was needed, and so, husbands, sons, daughters, and friends were enlisted. The show opened on January 18, 1956, at the Marblehead Junior High School Auditorium.

And so Marblehead Little Theatre (MLT) was born and now over five decades later has proven to be one of the oldest community theatre groups in New England as well as one of the few to have continually produced shows each year.

Throughout the 1950s, MLT held its main productions at the high school using the proscenium stage. As the group gained recognition, they were asked to perform at churches, charity functions, and veteran's hospitals and began including a number of one-act plays suitable for these occasions. MLT has also performed ''Leonardo da Vinci'' as a children's presentation at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

===The 1960s===

By the 1960s, MLT was not only doing workshops such as ''J.B.'' and ''The Lady's Not For Burning'', but they also ventured into the new theatre of the absurd with. ''Zoo Story'' and ''The Bald Soprano''. In 1963, MLT was invited to participate in the Marblehead Arts Festival, performing two one-act plays on an outdoor stage.

A big leap was made in the mid-1960s by the decision to take the plunge and do a musical. They got their feet wet by presenting ''The Fantasticks'' with a cast of seven, minimal scenery and an orchestra consisting of a pianist, a harpist, and a percussionist. The show received such an enthusiastic reception that they were inspired to stage a full-scale musical, ''Pajama Game'', in November 1965. The cast of forty came from all over the North Shore, with membership drawn from Salem, Swampscott, Peabody, Danvers, Beverly and Hamilton. This was a big production with 18 musical numbers, singing and dancing, many set changes and, most of all, a full orchestra which was presented at Salem State College's large auditorium and was a sell-out.

Since then, MLT has presented at least one musical production each year, which has become the hallmark of the group. The 1960s also saw MLT's entrance into the New England Theatre Conference Annual Community Theatre Drama Festival competition. During the 1960s MLT began awarding an annual scholarship to a member of the Marblehead High School graduating class who has participated in theatrical productions during high school as well as contributed in some way to Marblehead Little Theatre.

===The 1970s===

In 1970, MLT revived ''The Fantasticks'' and became a traveling group taking the show to Beverly for a benefit performance for the North Shore Community College. They also toured Endicott College, Arlington, Concord, and the Essex Agricultural and Technical Institute in Danvers.

Historic Abbot Hall became the setting for many musicals produced in the 1970s with the initial staging of ''Kiss Me Kate'' followed with superb performances of ''Man of La Mancha'', ''Fiddler on the Roof'', ''Brigadoon'', ''Camelot'', as well as productions for children of ''The Red Shoes'' and ''Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp''.

Perhaps the most memorable performance of the 1970s at Abbot Hall was opening night of the Bicentennial show of ''1776''. There were parties before and after the performance hosted by the Marblehead Bicentennial Commission in the Selectman's Meeting Room with the original Willard painting of the ''Spirit of '76'' as a most appropriate and inspiring backdrop.

===The 1980s===

In the 1980s, MLT began staging their productions at the new Nelson Aldrich Performing Arts Center at the Marblehead High School with a seating capacity of 766 and a stage to rival the best of Boston's professional theater. The professionalism and quality of the two major musicals staged yearly greatly enhanced the growing reputation of MLT as a high caliber community theatre. Audiences flocked to see such productions as ''The Music Man'', ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'', and ''Company''.

===The 1990s===

During the 1990s, MLT's major project has been obtaining a home of their own to stage small productions, conduct workshops, and provide space to store and build sets, to rehearse, as well as store props and costumes.

The desire to do smaller plays in addition to our{{who|date=May 2012}} yearly big musicals resulted in the production of an original play ''One Civilized Person'' in 1995 as a part of the Marblehead Festival of Arts and later, productions of ''Exit the Body'', ''The Cemetery Club'' and ''Bullshot Crummond'', all staged at the Tower School in Marblehead.

1998's major production of ''The Wizard of Oz'' staged at the Aldrich Center played to sold out audiences.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

During the production of ''The King and I'' in the Fall of 1999, the Marblehead Board of Selectmen awarded the School Street Firehouse to Marblehead Little Theatre.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

'''''Microsoft Corp. v. Shah''''' was an 
[[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]] (ACPA) case heard before the 
[[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington]]. [[Microsoft]] sued the [[defendant]]s, Amish Shah and others, for, among other charges, ''contributory cybersquatting'' for encouraging others, through videos and software, to infringe on Microsoft's [[trademark]]s. The case was settled out of court in July 2011 after judge [[Ricardo S. Martinez]] denied Shah's motion for dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

==Background== 
Amish Shah, with help from the other defendants, registered [[domain name]]s containing Microsoft trademarks, and induced others to register similar domains. Some of these domains used possible misspellings of trademarked Microsoft names.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby Jones, "[https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2011/01/14/on-microsoft-and-contributory-cybersquatting/ On Microsoft and ‘Contributory Cybersquatting]", ''Wall Street Journal'' Law Blog, 14 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consumers seeking Microsoft products could mistakenly end up at the defendants' website and be tricked into downloading the defendants' products. In addition to [[cybersquatting]], the defendants also produced instructions (including a video) on how to use Microsoft's marks in a misleading manner to maximize traffic to the website. Shah also offered a software system that enabled buyers to easily create websites incorporating Microsoft's marks.

On the basis of the latter, Microsoft made claims for ''contributory cybersquatting'' and contributory [[trademark dilution]], in addition to cybersquatting, trademark dilution, and [[trademark infringement]]. Defendants moved to dismiss the claims for contributory cybersquatting and contributory dilution, arguing that such causes of action are not recognized under law. The ACPA created liability only for registering, trafficking, or using a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to a protected mark. Additionally, the ACPA required proof that the defendant acted with "bad faith with intent to profit from the mark."&lt;ref name="acpa-bad-faith"&gt;{{USCSub|15|1125|d|1|A|i}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court== 

Judge Ricardo Martinez decided against dismissal on January 12, 2011, affirming that Microsoft had a possible case against Shah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

&lt;/ref&gt; reasoned that a higher standard was required for claims of contributory cybersquatting.

The court noted that the decision of the Ford court indicated that the court had recognized a cause of action under contributory cybersquatting, but found in favor of GreatDomains.com since Ford failed to show the requisite bad faith by GreatDomains.com.{{source needed|date=December 2014}} The Judge noted that in this particular case, the facts clearly demonstrated bad faith with an intent to profit, and as such denied the defendants' motion to dismiss.{{source needed|date=December 2014}} While the ACPA does not explicitly address causes of action under [[contributory liability]], the court noted that action under the ACPA is a [[tort]]-like cause of action, and traditional principles of [[tort law]] impose [[legal liability|liability]] on those who assist or contribute in the infringement.{{source needed|date=December 2014}}

==Impact== 

The court's decision notably expanded liability under the ACPA to include contributory damages, basing its decision on traditional principles of liability of tort law. Several scholars noted that the court's decision provides a precedent for expanding ACPA liability, beyond actions explicitly prohibited by the text of the law.&lt;ref name="jolt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt; This was particularly notable since Microsoft did not have to prove that the defendant actually sold any domain names to third parties or helped third parties acquire domain names.&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt;

An attempt was made in 2009 to sue [[GoDaddy]], a [[domain registrar]], under a different charge of "contributory cybersquatting". In this case, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District Court of California]] ruled in favor of GoDaddy in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://tigerintellectual.wordpress.com/2012/01/12/godaddy-in-suit-for-cybersquatting-contributory-cybersquatting/ Godaddy In Suit For Cybersquatting &amp; Contributory Cybersquatting]", ''Tiger Intellectual'', 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first incarnation of American toy company [[Hasbro]]'s '''[[My Little Pony]]''' [[toy]]line began in 1982 as a successor of [[My Little Pony#My Pretty Pony|My Pretty Pony]] toys. It went on to expand into a [[media franchise]], beginning with the airing of a [[Rescue at Midnight Castle|22-minute syndicated animated television special]] in 1984 in the United States. This incarnation is unofficially known among collectors as "Generation One" or "G1".

After the relative lack of success of the [[My Little Pony#My Pretty Pony|My Pretty Pony]] toy line, Hasbro introduced six smaller and colorful versions of the toy in 1982, sold under the title ''My Little Pony''. The toy line lead to many more merchandise under the ''My Little Pony'' brand. The pony toys were followed by [[Pegasus|winged ponies]], [[Unicorn|Unicorn ponies]], Flutter Ponies and Sea Ponies. Flutter Ponies were smaller and thinner than Pegasus Ponies, and had fluttering wings. Windy Wing and the Summer Wing Ponies were smaller than the Flutter Ponies and were proportioned in a similar way, with larger, butterfly-like wings. The Sea Ponies resembled [[seahorse]]s, and were produced as both adults and babies. There were also male ponies called 'Big Brother Ponies', which had slightly larger bodies and feathered hooves resembling those of [[Clydesdale (horse)|Clydesdale]] horses.

Many different sets of My Little Pony variations were produced, the first being the Rainbow Ponies in 1983. Other variations included the So-Soft Ponies (covered in [[Flocking (texture)|flocking]]), Twinkle-Eyed Ponies which had rhinestones in place of eyes, Twice-As-Fancy Ponies with patterns covering most of the body, Brush 'n' Grow Ponies which had a longer-than-usual mane and tail stored inside the body, Pony Friends - animals designed in the same style as the ponies, such as a lion, giraffe, kangaroo and zebra, among others - and Baby Ponies, some of which were smaller versions of previously released ponies and presented as those ponies' foals. The first generation of My Little Pony toys was sold in the U.S. until 1992, and was marketed internationally until 1995. The final year of sales in the U.S. was advertised as the "celebration year" of My Little Pony.

===Mail-order ponies===
All packaging came with Horseshoe Points, which could be used to obtain discounts on special ponies available only through [[mail order]]. The Horseshoe Point program was offered in both the US and UK, although the items available for purchase varied by country. Mail-order ponies were generally reissues like Majesty, which was previously available only with the Dream Castle Playset, or unique ponies such as the first boy pony, Lucky the stallion. Another line of exclusively mail-order ponies was the Birthflower ponies, which featured a pony for every month of the year. All had white bodies with pink hair and tails; their names were Carnation, Violet, Daffodil, Daisy, Lily of the Valley, Rose, Water Lily, Poppy, Morning Glory, Cosmos, Chrysantheum and Holly. Special baby ponies, such as the Pearlized Baby Ponies and Twice-As-Fancy babies, were also available by mail order. Some mail-order ponies, such as Sweet Scoops, Goldilocks and Rapunzel are rare and sought after by collectors.

===International ponies===
Some companies were licensed under Hasbro to produce their own line of ponies instead of shipping them from China or Hong Kong, where the vast majority of ponies were produced; these companies were located in Argentina, Brazil, France, Greece, India, Italy, Macau, Mexico and Spain. Some of these ponies are very similar to their Asian counterparts. For example, the Italian Clio looks very similar to Glory, with the most obvious difference being a non-glittery symbol. Some, such as the Mexican Twilight are a variation on existing colors, poses or species, while others, such as the Greek Ladybird, are completely unique to their region.

Due to factors such as limited production and their condition, international ponies tend to bring a higher price than their more-common counterparts.  Ponies from certain countries are also easier to find, while others, such as those made in Greece and Brazil, are more difficult. There are also international ponies which were distributed from China or Hong Kong, but made exclusively for a particular region, either a variant of the local ponies or completely new types.

Most ponies released in the United States were found in Western Europe as well. The majority of US domestic mail-order ponies never appeared overseas, although many countries had their own mail-order systems. Many of the excess ponies offered by mail order in the US were bagged, carded and sold overseas. Some of the ponies and playsets were given different names abroad; for example, the Big Brother Ponies were known as Adventure Boy Ponies in the UK.

===Related lines===
;Petite Ponies
Petite Ponies were tiny pony figures sold in sets. Some had different characteristics, such as brushable hair, pearlized or [[Phosphorescence|glow-in-the-dark]] bodies. Under the base of each was an engraved hoof, which allowed the pony to function as a key to the Petite Playsets. Most of these smaller ponies had no official name, and many had the same symbols. They were sold from 1989 to 1991; only Earth Ponies and Pegasus Ponies were produced.

;Dream Beauties
These larger figures made of hard plastic were advertised as "grown up" ponies and called Dream Beauties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ponylandpress.com/dreambeauties/ |title=Dream Beauties - My Little Pony |publisher=Ponyland Press |date= |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike My Little Pony toys, they looked more like real horses in proportions and musculature. The Dream Beauties came in a range of decorated and accessorized styles, including plastic beads along the base of their manes, ornamentation in the style of carousel horses, glitter or pearlescent finishes, and elaborate symbols, some extending the full length of the body.  All were Earth Ponies, except for the three Highflying Beauties, which had large, multicolored wings. They were sold from 1989 to 1990.

;My Little Kitty/Puppy/Bunny
Cat, dog and rabbit sets were sold under the Hasbro MLP logo during the early 1990s. Each Lil' Litters set consisted of a mother, two babies and a plastic comb. The mothers had flocked bodies, and the babies were miniature plastic figures. Kitty mothers had cottony tails, puppy mothers had either silky or cottony ears and bunny mothers had cottony tails and silky forelocks. There were also Nursery Family sets, featuring the puppy and kitty characters.

;Takara Variants
In 1984, [[Takara]] (Later merged with [[Tomy]] to form a single company) released a line of My Little Pony toys, which were released in two types: {{nihongo|'''Osharena Pony'''|おしゃれなポニー|Osharena ponī}} and {{nihongo|'''Kawaii Pony'''|かわいいポニー|Kawaī ponī}}. Only released in Japan, these are a more anthropomorphic take on the toyline and considered as the most rare of the "G1" collection due to how they were released.

==Media==
===Mid-1980s animated features===
{{Main|Rescue at Midnight Castle|Escape from Catrina|My Little Pony: The Movie (1986 film)|My Little Pony (TV series)}}
As a part of Hasbro's media strategy, My Little Pony, along with their other properties like [[Transformers]] and [[G.I. Joe]], was adapted into following animated features:
* ''My Little Pony'' (later retitled ''[[Rescue at Midnight Castle]]''), the first 22-minute [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] prime-time special premiered in 1984
* ''[[Escape from Catrina|My Little Pony: Escape from Catrina]]'', the second 22-minute syndicated special premiered in 1985, in which [[Tammy Grimes]] voiced the title character.
* ''[[My Little Pony: The Movie (1986 film)|My Little Pony: The Movie]]'', the first and only theatrical feature film released in [[1986 in film|1986]]. Directed by Michael Joens, it featured the voices of [[Rhea Perlman]], [[Madeline Kahn]], [[Tony Randall]] and [[Danny DeVito]]. It had mediocre box-office earnings, grossing almost $6 million in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mylittlepony.htm |title=Boxofficemojo -My Little Pony (1986) |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received mostly negative reviews from critics.
* ''My Little Pony 'n Friends'', a half-hour syndicated television series that featured various characters from Hasbro's properties by having ''[[My Little Pony (TV series)|My Little Pony]]'' in its first segment and either ''[[Glo Friends]]'', ''[[Potato Head Kids]]'' or ''[[MoonDreamers]]'' in the second segment. The ''My Little Pony'' segment promoted many of the toys available in 1986–1987, featuring a regular cast of Earth, Pegasus and Unicorn ponies with guest appearances by new lines, such as the Flutter and Princess Ponies. It also used the jingles for each brand, as did other series tied into Hasbro properties. Consist of 65 episodes, it had the version of the first two specials, each edited into two episodes respectively.&lt;!--UNCERTAIN. PLEASE CHECK: When exported outside USA, the serials would broadcast under separate brands.--&gt;

The TV specials, the film, and the TV series were all set in the same milieu: Dream Valley, a land inhabited by witches, goblins and other magical creatures with whom the ponies, their human friend Megan, and their dragon friend Spike interacted.

In 2004, the first season of the original ''My Little Pony'' television series was released on DVD. The four-DVD collection features the two prime-time television specials and 50 episodes from the original series. Some songs from the original airing of the two specials have been cut, leaving the specials as they appeared when syndicated as part of the cartoon series. The ten-episode miniseries ''The End of Flutter Valley'' was released on DVD in 2005. 2006 brought the release of episodes from the second season, with two DVD releases: ''Flight to Cloud Castle and Other Stories'' and ''Quest of the Princess Ponies and Other Stories'', as well as a DVD entitled ''Two Great Pony Tales'' with ''The Magic Coins'' and ''The Glass Princess'' available in eight episodes.

===''My Little Pony Tales'' (1992)===
{{Main|My Little Pony Tales}}
''[[My Little Pony Tales]]'', premiered on July 3, 1992 on [[Disney Channel]], was set in a different environment. This series [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] the ponies further than the works from the mid-1980s, as the ponies lived in a town, went to school, ran businesses, went on vacation and exchanged currency for goods.

===Publications===
{{Main|My Little Pony (Egmont comics)}}
[[My Little Pony (Egmont comics)|Two British comic series]] were published by [[Egmont Group|Egmont]] during the era.

==Other merchandises==
Besides the toys, merchandise included children's bedding and room decorations, plush toys, puzzles, clothing, books and playsets. There were also unusual items such as a [[pomander]] and toy sewing machines. In 1985, a picture disc featuring songs by Tony Markey was released.

During the 2000s, like other fictional characters of the 1980s, My Little Pony merchandise aimed at young women has also appeared, including T-shirts depicting "G1" ponies in a "retro" style, featuring slogans such as "Livin' in the 80s" or "I Love Rainbows".

* To celebrate the 25th anniversary of My Little Pony, [[Hasbro]] reproduced the original 1982 ''My Little Pony'' collection. The ponies reproduced were Blue Belle, Butterscotch, Cotton Candy, Snuzzle, Blossom and Minty. Hasbro has also reproduced the Generation One Rainbow Ponies, Moonstone, Parasol, Skydancer, Starshine, Sunlight and Windy.
* Generation One Ponies key chains were sold in Japan. Ponies sold as key chains were Milky Way, Dancing Butterflies, Sugarberry, Starbow, Rainribbon, Sunribbon and Baby Stockings, which came in either red or green. They had comb-able hair, and came with a small comb. The key chains are rare, and valued by collectors.

A '''resistant reading''' is a reading of a text which moves beyond the dominant cultural beliefs to challenge prevailing views. It means to read a text as it was not meant to be read; in fact reading the text against itself.

==Textual example==
By way of illustration, consider [[Andrew Marvell]]'s poem [[To His Coy Mistress]].

A resistant reading may develop from an alternative reading, pointing out how the [[representation (arts)|representation]] of [[gender]] in the poem furthers the notion of gender as [[binary opposition]]s, the male is active and powerful, the female is passive and marginalized. As such, it will be read by readers who share [[feminist]] views of the world as [[gender inequality]] and discrimination against women. For example, Marvell's representation of [[heterosexuality]] in the poem may be read as being exploitative, based as it is on the persona psychologically terrorizing the woman. Marvell depicts his persona as attempting to have the woman submit as a result of the fear he seeks to instill within her; Marvell's vivid and confronting [[image]]ry is most significant and not accidental:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound / My echoing song: then worms shall try / That long preserved [[virginity]]...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Importance==
Resistant reading is an important element of our critical and interpretive repertoire. It is worth considering whether [[diegesis|diegetic]] border crossing always strengthens the potential for resistant reading (as might seem intuitively likely, given that readers are moving in and out of the story), or whether on some occasions it might trigger the reverse effect.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Literacy Research,  Spring 2003  by Mackey, Margaret&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Small Press Distribution''' ('''SPD''') is a non-profit [[literary arts]] organization located in [[Berkeley, California]].  As their name indicates, the core of their mission is to act as an umbrella [[distribution (business)|distributor]] and [[marketing|marketer]] for hundreds of smaller literary [[Publishing|publishers]].  SPD's primary mission is to get the books of their publishers out to bookstores, libraries, book [[wholesale]]rs, and directly to readers and writers.

==History==

SPD was founded in 1969 by Peter Howard of Serendipity Books and Jack Shoemaker of Sand Dollar Press. The fledgling organization provided small-scale distribution services for only five publishers.  Initially called Serendipity Books Distribution, it was renamed Small Press Distribution by the late 1970s. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the organization periodically assembled the new titles of their publishers into printed catalogs, thus providing a vital link to underground literature for writers and readers around the US.  

By 1980, SPD was distributing the books of about 40 small publishers; by 1990, the number had grown to 330.  Today, SPD distributes books for approximately 400 publishers, each of whom produces anywhere from one to twenty books a year.

SPD became an official 501c3 non-profit in 1996.  Since that time, its sales and staff have grown despite the demise of many [[independent bookstore]]s that previously operated as its most consistent customer base.  

Given the nature of commercial publishing and for-profit book distribution, a case can be made that SPD has played a vital role in keeping grassroots, noncommercial poetry and fiction continuously available in the U.S. to new generations of readers over the last three decades.

The '''Society of Polish Artists "Sztuka"''' ({{lang-pl|Towarzystwo Artystów Polskich "Sztuka"; Sztuka means '''Art''' in [[Polish language|Polish]], '''art'''yzm means artistic abilities}}) founded in 1897 in [[Kraków]], was a gathering of prominent Polish visual artists from around the turn of the century (or [[fin-de-siècle]] era) living under the foreign [[partitions of Poland]]. Its main goal was to reaffirm the importance and unique character of Polish contemporary art at a time, when Poland could not exist as sovereign nation.&lt;ref name="Kossowska" /&gt;

The immediate inspiration for the founding of the new society came from the ground-breaking art exhibit inaugurated on May 27, 1897 at [[Sukiennice Museum|Sukiennice]] in [[Main Square, Kraków]].&lt;ref name="Brzyski" /&gt; It was held by Polish modernist painters,&lt;ref name="Brzyski" /&gt; and called ''A Separate Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture'' (''Wystawa osobna obrazów i rzeźb'').&lt;ref name="Kozakowska" /&gt; The show was visited by approximately 6,000 guests, and proclaimed a success. The first meeting of Sztuka Society took place on October 27, 1897.&lt;ref name="1898-Report" /&gt; Among its founding members were a generation of academics from the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|School of Fine Arts]] who also participated in the show, including future Rectors of the Academy: [[Leon Wyczółkowski]], [[Teodor Axentowicz]], [[Jacek Malczewski]], [[Józef Mehoffer]]; as well as artists [[Józef Chełmoński]], [[Julian Fałat]], [[Antoni Piotrowski]], [[Jan Stanisławski (painter)|Jan Stanisławski]], [[Włodzimierz Tetmajer]] and [[Stanisław Wyspiański]].&lt;ref name="Brzyski" /&gt;

==Principles==
Sztuka's artistic philosophy was by no means homogeneous – encompassing all facets of the [[Young Poland]] movement including [[neo-romanticism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], [[impressionism]] and [[art nouveau]]. Sculpture was represented in Sztuka by [[Xawery Dunikowski]], [[Bolesław Biegas]], [[Konstanty Laszczka]], and [[Wacław Szymanowski]]. It was "a happy hour" for Polish modernists, wrote historian Maria Poprzecka, because the prevailing trends in European art of the time ([[Edvard Munch]], [[August Strindberg]]) were perfectly aligned with extreme pessimism of the Poles under the foreign rule.&lt;ref name="Kossowska" /&gt;

The membership of the society was tightly controlled in order to protect its identity. It was especially important considering that the Polish artists were forced to exhibit abroad under the banner of Poland's own occupiers. For example, when the 1892 Munich International Exhibition of Fine Arts chose to create a Polish department, the Tsarist official from the Russian-controlled Warsaw named it a political provocation in his official protest. As a result, at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 World Exposision]] Poles from the [[Russian partition|Russian sector]] of occupied Poland were allowed to exhibit only with the Russians from Russia.&lt;ref name="Facos" /&gt;

Sztuka Society survived two world wars. With time, many other prominent artists joined in such as [[Olga Boznańska]] and [[Józef Pankiewicz]]. Its role began to diminish in the [[Second Polish Republic|interwar period]]. The society was also criticized for being too exclusive and accused of having nationalistic ideals. However, it was discontinued only under the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Stalinist era (1948–1956)|Stalinist system]], in 1950.&lt;ref name="Bartelik" /&gt;

'''''St. Bernardino of Siena between Two Angels''''' is a painting attributed to the Italian [[Renaissance]] artist [[Andrea Mantegna]] and his assistants, dated to 1460 and housed in the [[Pinacoteca di Brera]] of [[Milan]].

The painting was located in the funerary chapel of marquis [[Ludovico III Gonzaga]], dedicated to St. Bernardino and situated in church of [[San Francesco (Mantua)|San Francesco]] in [[Mantua]]. It was acquired by the Milanese gallery in 1811.

==Description==
The painting portrays the saint in a central position. He holds the [[Holy Name of Jesus|IHS monogram]] (referring to the name of Jesus) on a gold plate, which he usually displayed at the end of his sermons.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jesus Prayer'' by Lev Gillet 1987 {{ISBN|0-88141-013-6}} page 112&lt;/ref&gt; He stands on a platform covered with an oriental carpet. At his sides are two angels, and, above the [[architrave]] over his head, are four sitting or kneeling [[cherubim]]s.

The architrave carries the inscription "Huius lingua salus hominum", meaning "His word is the safety of men". The arch is decorated with festoons with flowers and fruit, a typical element of Mantegna's paintings in [[Padua]], influenced by [[Francesco Squarcione]]. The basement has a [[cartouche]] with the date 1460 (according to others, 1468 or 1469).

It is currently disputed if the painting was executed by Mantegna and his assistants, or by the latter alone.

==History==
The Swedish Arts Council (p.k.a. The Swedish National Council for Cultural Affairs) was established in 1974, in conjunction with the cultural policy
decision of that year, as a public authority with the mission of bringing to fruition the cultural policies adopted by the Riksdag and the government.{{ref|a}}{{ref|b}} Since then, the cultural policies of Sweden have been revised by the Riksdag a number of times. In 1996, the special significance of literature was highlighted through the adoption of a separate piece of legislation, the Library Act. In 2009 a decision to amend the principles for disbursement of state subsidies were adopted. Thus, since 2011, the regions disburse a bigger proportion of the state subsidies.&lt;ref name=history-en&gt;{{cite web|title=Swedish Arts Council|url=http://www.kulturradet.se/Documents/publikationer/2012/swedish_arts_council.pdf|publisher=Swedish Arts Council|accessdate=27 July 2014|page=5|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promoting Culture|url=http://www.kulturradet.se/upload/kr/publikationer/2000/promoting_culture.pdf|publisher=Swedish Arts Council|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sächsische Akademie der Künste''' (Saxon Academy of Arts) is a German cultural organisation for the state of [[Saxony]], based in [[Dresden]]. It awards an esteemed individual annually.

== Purpose ==

The Academy is a [[statutory corporation]] to promote the arts in Saxony, make proposals for its promotion and maintain the traditions of the Saxon cultural area ("die Kunst zu fördern, Vorschläge zu ihrer Förderung zu machen und die Überlieferungen des sächsischen Kulturraums zu pflegen", Founding Act of 1994).&lt;!-- She speaks from the own responsibility and develops public impact. It is defined in its constitution as a community of artists and art theorists, representing freedom and claim the art of the state and society and the public with important artistic achievements of time does. --&gt; Situated between the older academies in [[Academy of Arts, Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Akademie der Bildenden Künste München|Munich]], the academy tries to enliven the intellectual and artistic richness of the East German cultural area, while simultaneously meeting the challenges associated with demographic, social and cultural changes. In immediate vicinity of the new member states of the European Union and historical leadership of Saxony in the Central and Eastern European cultural area, the Academy feels obliged to accompany the political unification culturally and artistically.
&lt;!--
Since 2005 she has organized in cooperation with the Central European center of the Technical [[University of Dresden]], the Chamisso poetics lectureship from. --&gt;

==History==

The initiative for the establishment of the academy came from a group of founders, which after 1990 included the publicist and essayist [[Friedrich Dieckmann]], the sculptor [[Wieland Förster]], the musician [[Ludwig Güttler]], the actor [[Frederick William Young (actor)|Frederick William Young]] and the art historian [[Werner Schmidt (art historian)|Werner Schmidt]]. After preparation of foundation law and the statutes, the Saxon State Parliament adopted on 27 May 1994, the "Gesetz über die Errichtung der Sächsischen Akademie der Künste" (Law on the establishment of the Saxon Academy of Arts). It was constituted on 29 February 1996 with 30 founding members. As of 2012, the academy has 151 members from Germany and abroad.
&lt;!--
==Members==
The Saxon Academy of the Arts unites ordinary members, corresponding members and honorary members from home and abroad. The members can be selected artist and theorist, who have distinguished themselves through their work in a special way and are connected by origin or effectiveness of the Saxon culture. These are the classes of the Academy nominated by secret ballot and the General Assembly for election. By the Senate of the General Assembly can also honorary members be nominated for election. Independent applications are excluded. --&gt;

The academy is organised in five sections, [[architecture]], [[arts]], [[performing arts]] and [[film]], [[literature]] and language, and [[music]].

==History==
The ''t'aenghwa'' tradition was part of the Buddhist heritage that came to the [[Korean Peninsula]] during the [[Three Kingdoms period]]. The earliest paintings to survive date back to the late 13th century, late [[Goryeo |Koryo]] dynasty. The early ''t'aenghwa'' tradition followed the norms of Central Asian and Chinese traditions with regard to icon modelling and the use of stencils. Most of the early ''t'aenghwa'' were painted on silk gauze using mineral colours.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1989" /&gt; Popular themes included the [[Pure Land Buddhism]] (Korean: [[Chont'o]]) and [[Avalokiteśvara]].&lt;ref name="Sorensen1989" /&gt; ''T'aenghwa'' were popular from the 17th century onwards. In the [[Joseon Dynasty|Chosŏn]] period, mural painting started to lose its popularity, making way for ''t'aenghwa''.&lt;ref name="WalravenBreuker2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walraven|first1=Boudewijn |last2=Breuker|first2=Remco E. |title=Korea in the middle: Korean studies and area studies : essays in honour of Boudewijn Walraven|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCDZtFu_1UIC&amp;pg=PA229|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=2007|publisher=CNWS Publications|isbn=978-90-5789-153-3|pages=229–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scrolls were often hang behind the central Buddhist sculpture in a Buddhist temple.  This was meant to enhance the sculptural image as well as provide an ambiance to the temple interior. Towards the end of the 20th century, ''t'aenghwa'' were in decline.&lt;ref name="Pratt2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratt|first=Keith |title=Everlasting Flower: A History of Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Gui8CdUfVoC&amp;pg=PA203|accessdate=30 December 2010|date=15 August 2007|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-335-2|pages=203–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''t'aenghwa'' was considered more of a craft than a high art practice, thus novice monks who showed talent were trained on the tradition by painting various mandatory images.&lt;ref name="artgallery.nsw.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/work/179-2008+buddha-amitabha-and-his-pantheon|title=Buddha Amitabha and his pantheon|work=artgallery.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workshops were sometimes located within the temple grounds and it was here that painters shared their craft with pupils. In the past, painters worked on commission but with few competent masters of ''t'aenghwa'' painting left, the tradition may die out within the next couple of generations.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1989" /&gt;

'''''The Circumcision'''''  is an oil on canvas painting of the [[Circumcision of Jesus]] by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], produced in 1605 during his stay in Rome. It is now in the 'Chiesa del Gesù e dei Santi Ambrogio e Andrea' church in [[Genoa]].

It was commissioned by Marcello Pallavicino, vestryman of the Casa Professa of Jesuits in Genoa. It is mainly influenced by [[Mantua]]n paintings from the court of [[Vincenzo Gonzaga]], with a strongly foreshortened viewpoint.

'''''The History of The Hobbit''''' is a two-volume study of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]’s ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It was published by [[HarperCollins]] in May and June 2007 in the United Kingdom, with both volumes released in the United States by [[Houghton Mifflin]] on 21 September 2007; a boxed set combining ''The Hobbit'' with ''The History of'' The Hobbit was released on 26 October 2007. A single volume edition was released on 27 October 2011.

The two-volume work contains Tolkien’s unpublished drafts of the novel, with commentary by John D. Rateliff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forodrim.org/arda/tbchron.html | title = A chronological bibliography of the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien | date = 1 September 2002 | origyear = 16 March 1996 | first = Åke | last = Bertenstam }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also details Tolkien’s various revisions to ''The Hobbit'', including abandoned revisions for the unpublished third edition of the work, intended for 1960, as well as previously unpublished original maps and illustrations drawn by Tolkien himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/historyofthehobbit2.htm | title = History of the Hobbit: An essential resource book for the forthcoming movie adaptation of The Hobbit | date = 13 October 2006 | publisher = Tolkien Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
''The History of'' The Hobbit: ''Volume I: Mr. Baggins''. This contains the first half of Tolkien’s draft material for ''The Hobbit'', along with commentary. It was published in the UK on 4 May 2007.

''The History of'' The Hobbit: ''Volume II: Return to Bag-End'', contains the last half of Tolkien’s original manuscript draft, with commentary and later drafts and appendices. It volume was published in the UK on 18 June 2007.

==Relationship to ''The History of Middle-earth''==
When [[Christopher Tolkien]] began publishing ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', a twelve-volume series documenting J. R. R. Tolkien’s creative writing process in the creation of [[Middle-earth]], with texts dating from the 1910s to the 1990s, he made a conscious decision not to issue a volume detailing the creation of ''The Hobbit''. According to him, ''The Hobbit'' was not originally a part of the Middle-earth universe and was attached to his father's earlier, far darker [[legendarium]] only superficially, although the existence of ''The Hobbit'' forever altered the legendarium.

As Christopher Tolkien was not going to embark on a published study of ''The Hobbit'', the task was given to Taum Santoski in the 1980s. Santoski had connections to the [[Marquette University|Marquette]] collection of Tolkien material, which is where the original manuscripts reside. He died in 1991, and ultimately the task passed to John Rateliff. Although Christopher Tolkien did not work directly on ''The History of The Hobbit'', the work is in a very similar vein to the "literary archaeology" of his ''History of Middle-earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/booksbytolkien/historyofme/description.htm | title = Books by J.R.R.Tolkien - The History of Middle-earth | work = Tolkien Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rateliff submitted a finished draft of the book to Christopher Tolkien, who, approving of the work, gave ''The History of The Hobbit'' his personal blessing to be published in association with his father’s other works.

'''The Kipling Society''' is a [[literary society]] open to everyone interested in the work and life of British author [[Rudyard Kipling]] (1865-1936). The Kipling Society focuses on Kipling and his place in English Literature, and as such attracts members from all over the world, both general readers and academic researchers.  

The Society’s activities include: regular meetings in the UK, a programme of lectures in London, and a formal Annual Luncheon with a distinguished guest speaker, as well as conferences. The Society publishes ''The Kipling Journal'' quarterly,  and hosts a comprehensive website, which includes a Readers’ Guide to Kipling’s works.  In addition, it runs an essay writing competition for schools, answers enquiries from the public (schools, publishers and writers), and works with the media. In 2014 it contributed to programmes commemorating the centenary of the [[First World War]]. The Society is a Registered Charity (No. 278885) and its activities are managed by a Council and run by the Secretary and honorary officers: The Hon. Secretary, John Lambert; Chair, Mary Hamer; Deputy Chair, John Radcliffe; President, Roger Ayers; Librarian, John Walker; Journal Editor, Janet Montefiore. 
 
==History and Aims==
Founded in 1927 while Kipling was still alive, the society is one of the oldest and most enduring literary societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Alliance of Literary Societies|url=http://www.allianceofliterarysocieties.org.uk/id11.html|accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kipling Society was founded by J H C Brooking and a few fellow enthusiasts, including Kipling's school-friends Major General L C Dunsterville and G C Beresford, who featured in ''Stalky &amp; Co.'' as "Stalky" and "M'Turk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrington|first1=Charles|title=Rudyard Kipling: His Life and Work|date=1986 |origyear=1955|publisher=Penguin|location=London|pages=58, 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aims are to promote interest in the works, life and times of Rudyard Kipling and to act as a physical and virtual meeting place for all those interested in him; to make the archive of existing knowledge accessible through its library and website; to foster new research and to support scholarly editions of previously unpublished work.

==Membership and Meetings==
Membership is open to anyone with an interest in the life and works of Rudyard Kipling. Members receive a copy of the quarterly Kipling Journal, and have access to the Society’s regular meetings, and to the Members’ pages of the Society’s web-site. The Society holds five meetings a year in central London, providing lectures and discussions on a range of Kipling-related topics. Meetings and seminars are also held in other parts of Britain from time to time.

==''The Kipling Journal''==
''The Kipling Journal'' is sent quarterly to all members of the Kipling Society and from January 2015 is peer-reviewed.{{cn|date=May 2015}} It includes articles, membership news, Society events, and the texts of talks given by invited speakers. Every issue of the journal is available online via the website except articles published within two years of the current date. 

==Conferences==
The Society organises conferences in partnership with academic institutions. These have attracted international scholars and been significant in developing thinking about Kipling’s work.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

''Kipling in America, 1892-1896'' was held at Marlboro College, Vermont, on October 7, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Boston Globe|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/10/07/vermont-hosts-kipling-society-meeting-outside-united-kingdom/gt0gC9nipwx26lcQcdEYQL/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symposium on Kipling's four years in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]] after his marriage to the American Caroline Balestier, focused on the influence of Kipling’s time in America on his work.
 
''Rudyard Kipling: an international writer'' was hosted by the [[Institute of English Studies]] at [[University of London]] in October 2011. This coincided with the launch of ''The Cambridge Companion to Kipling'' and many of its contributors were also speakers.
 
''The Kent Conference'' was held at the [[University of Kent]] in September 2007. The conference was organised to mark the centenary of Kipling's Nobel Prize for Literature. It was directed by Dr Jan Montefiore and sponsored by the Kipling Society.

''Post-Colonial Kipling'' was held at [[Magdalene College]], [[Cambridge University]] in September 2001, a century after the publication of ''Kim''. There were four major themes, Kipling: a post-colonial assessment, Kipling and women, Kipling and film, and Kipling in translation.

==The Kipling Library==
The Society maintains a research library of over 1,300 items which can be consulted by members. Kipling’s works were published in a variety of different editions during his lifetime and many of these are owned by the library. It holds a complete set of the Sussex Edition, the most complete single collection of Kipling’s works, which he edited before his death in 1936, and the Cambridge Edition of his verse, the most comprehensive collection of his poetry, edited by Thomas Pinney and published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinney (ed.)|first1=Thomas|title=The Cambridge Edition of the Poems of Rudyard Kipling, 3 Volumes|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library contains biographies, collections of press cuttings, photographs and relevant memorabilia, critical studies and a growing set of translations of Kipling’s works in other languages.  Until June 2014, the Library was housed at City University, London. Most of the collection is now at [[Haileybury College]], Kipling’s old school, with some items being held at [[Sussex University]].

==The Society’s Website==
The Society’s website is a source of information about Kipling’s life and works, including a number of his short stories and articles not published elsewhere. In addition, it offers a range of research tools, guides and back-issues of The Kipling Journal. The website also includes the Readers' Guide, providing introductions and notes to accompany each story, article, and poem. 
 
==The John Slater Memorial Kipling Essay Prize==
The John Slater Memorial Kipling Essay Prize is awarded annually for the winning essay by a Sixth Form student, on selected works by Rudyard Kipling. The prize is £750 (£250 for the student and £500 for the school or college).

==The Rudyard Kipling Mailbase==
A Rudyard Kipling discussion forum enables any member of the 'Rudyard-Kipling' mailbase to exchange messages by email with everyone else on the list globally.

==Bateman’s==
[[Bateman's]] was Rudyard Kipling's House at Burwash in Sussex for over thirty years. It is now a National Trust property and there are close connections with the Kipling Society and a Bateman’s liaison officer keeps members informed of events and developments.

A '''tomb''' (from {{lang-grc-gre|τύμβος}} ''tumbos'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtu%2Fmbos τύμβος],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[:wikt:repository|repository]] for the remains of the dead. It is generally any structurally enclosed interment space or burial chamber, of varying sizes.

==Overview==
The word is used in a broad sense to encompass a number of such types of places of interment or, occasionally, [[grave (burial)|burial]], including:

*[[Shrine|Architectural shrines]] – in [[Christianity]], an architectural shrine above a [[saint]]'s first [[grave (burial)|place of burial]], as opposed to a similar &lt;ref&gt;sup&lt;/ref&gt; on which stands a [[reliquary]] or [[feretory]] into which the saint's remains have been transferred
*[[Burial vault (tomb)|Burial vault]] – a stone or brick-lined underground space for multiple [[burial]]s, originally [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]], often privately owned for specific family groups; usually beneath a religious building such as a [[Church architecture|church]] or in a [[churchyard]] or [[cemetery]]
*[[Church monument]] – within a church (or a tomb-style chest in a churchyard) may be a place of interment, but this is unusual; it may more commonly stand over the [[grave (burial)|grave]] or burial vault rather than containing the actual body and therefore is not a tomb.
*[[Crypt]]s – often, though not always, for interment; similar to burial vaults but usually for more general public interment
*[[Hypogeum]] tomb - stone-built underground structure for interment, such as the [[:Category:Tombs of ancient Egypt|tombs of ancient Egypt]]
*[[Kokh (tomb)]] – a rectangular rock-cut sloping space, running inward, like tunnels into rock, sufficiently high and wide to permit the admission of a corpse
*[[Martyrium (architecture)|Martyrium]] – Mausoleum for the remains of martyrs, such as [[San Pietro in Montorio]]
*[[Mausoleum]] (including [[Pyramid#Ancient monuments|ancient pyramid]] in some countries) – external free-standing structure, above ground, acting as both monument and place of interment, usually for individuals or a family group
*[[Megalithic tomb]] (including [[Chamber tomb]]) – prehistoric place of interment, often for large communities, constructed of large stones and originally covered with an earthen mound
*[[Ohel (grave)|Ohel]], a structure built around the grave or graves of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Rebbe]]s, prominent rabbis, Jewish community leaders, and biblical figures in Israel and the diaspora
*[[Pillar tomb]] – a monumental grave. Its central feature is a single, prominent pillar or column, often made of stone.
*[[Rock-cut tomb]] – a form widespread in the ancient world, in which the tomb is not built but carved out of the rock and can be a free-standing building but is more commonly a cave, which may be extensive and may or may not have an elaborate facade.
*[[Sarcophagus]] – a stone container for a body or [[coffin]], often decorated and perhaps part of a monument; it may stand within a religious building or greater tomb or mausoleum.
*Sepulchre – a cavernous [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-cut space for interment]], generally in the [[Jew]]ish or Christian faiths (cf. [[Holy Sepulchre]]).&lt;ref name="morana"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morana|first1=Martin|title=Bejn Kliem u Storja|date=2011|publisher=Books Distributors Limited|location=[[Malta]]|language=Maltese|isbn=978-99957-0137-6|page=211|url=http://www.bdlbooks.com/history/3677-bejn-kliem-u-storja.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020070442/http://www.bdlbooks.com/history/3677-bejn-kliem-u-storja.html|archivedate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Samadhi (shrine)|Samadhi]] – in India a tomb for a deceased saint that often has a larger building over it as a shrine
*Other forms of archaeological "tombs", such as [[ship burial]]s
*[[Tumulus]] – (plural: tumuli) A [[mound]] of [[Soil|earth]] and [[Rock (geology)|stone]]s raised over a [[Grave (burial)|grave]] or graves. Tumuli are also known as ''barrows'', ''burial mounds'', ''Hügelgräber'' or ''[[kurgan]]s''', and can be found throughout much of the [[world]]. A [[cairn]] (a mound of stones built for various purposes), might also be originally a tumulus. A [[long barrow]] is a long tumulus, usually for numbers of burials.

As indicated, tombs are generally located in or under religious buildings, such as churches, or in cemeteries or churchyards. However, they may also be found in [[catacombs]], on private land or, in the case of early or pre-historic tombs, in what is today open landscape.

The [[Daisen Kofun]], the tomb of [[Emperor Nintoku]] (the 16th Emperor of Japan), is the largest in the world by area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/280862/lifestyle/travel/where-emperors-sleep-japan-s-keyhole-shaped-burial-mounds|title=Where emperors sleep: Japan's keyhole-shaped burial mounds|last=Merueñas|first=Mark|date=2012-11-04|work=|newspaper=GMA News Online|quote=The Nintoku-ryo tumulus is one of almost 50 tumuli collectively known as "Mozu Kofungun" clustered around the city, and covers the largest area of any tomb in the world.|access-date=2017-01-11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Pyramid of Khufu]] in [[Egypt]] is the largest by volume.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3787">'''''Treasures of the Underworld''''' was an exhibition featured in the [[New Zealand]] pavilion of [[Seville Expo '92]]. 

==The exhibition==

The exhibition featured 48 works, comprising a total of 399 individual pieces. It was extremely successful with over half a million visitors to New Zealand's Pavilion, making it the most-visited exhibition of New Zealand art to that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lloyd-Jenkins|first1=Douglas|last2=Hammond|first2=Lucy|title=Crafts and applied arts - Craft in the 1990s|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/crafts-and-applied-arts/page-9|website=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=24 January 2015|date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The exhibition was curated by the art curator [[James Mack]] and featured commissions completed by New Zealand's top practitioners of object art in glass and clay at that time. 

The artists who contributed works were:

*[[Len Castle]]
*[[Ann Robinson (artist)| Ann Robinson]]
*[[Steve Fullmer]]
*[[Ann Verdcourt]]
*[[Darryl Robertson]]
*[[Christine Boswijk]]
*[[Richard Parker (potter)| Richard Parker]]
*[[Barry Brickell]]
*[[Paerau Corneal]]
*[[Brian Gartside]]
*[[Julia van Helden]]
*[[Christine Hellyar]]
*[[Chester Nealie]]
*[[Robyn Stewart]]

==Exhibition theme==

The theme of the commissions was the celebration of the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's first voyage to America. This emphasis on voyage and discovery influenced the artists to explore the connections with New Zealand and the familiar world of the South Pacific. [[James Mack]] urged each artist to stretch both materials and technique beyond Eurocentric influences. 

==Influence==

The interest the works generated came as a surprise. [[Ian Fraser (broadcaster)|Ian Fraser]] the Commissioner at the NZ Expo said &lt;blockquote&gt;We were overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the response....&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christchurchartgallery.org.nz/Bulletin/96/Bulletin96.pdf The Robert MccDougall Art Gallery Bulletin No. 96 June/July 1995] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016112650/http://www.christchurchartgallery.org.nz/Bulletin/96/Bulletin96.pdf |date=2008-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The work produced for this exhibition has and continues to influence the development of object art in New Zealand. The success of the exhibition also boosted the profile of ceramic and glass artists in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lloyd-Jenkins|first1=Douglas|last2=Hammond|first2=Lucy|title=Crafts and applied arts - Craft in the 1990s|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/45327/treasures-of-the-underworld-seville-expo-92|website=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=24 January 2015|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a personal request from Queen Beatrice of Holland, the exhibition toured to Die Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam, Holland, before returning to New Zealand for a nationwide tour.

After the tours were complete the artworks were accessioned into the permanent collection of the New Zealand National Art Gallery - now the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].

The '''Vani Gospels''' (Vani Four Gospels; {{lang-ka|ვანის ოთხთავი}}, {{lang|ka-Latn|Vanis otkhtavi}}) is an [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Tetraevangelion|Four Gospels]] in the [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]] ''nuskhuri'' script dating from the end of the 12th–early 13th centuries. The manuscript was composed at the queen [[Tamar of Georgia]]'s request by the Georgian [[monk]] John the Unworthy at the Rhomana Monastery at [[Constantinople]]. It was later brought to Georgia and kept first at the Shorata Monastery ([[Meskheti]]), then in [[Vani]] ([[Imereti]]; hence comes its name) and eventually at the [[Gelati Monastery]] at [[Kutaisi]]. 

The manuscript consists of 274 [[wikt:folio|folio]]s each of 29X21 cm in size and is abundantly illuminated. It is now at the [[Georgian National Center of Manuscripts]] in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia (A-1335).

'''Moshe Ze'ev Flinker''' (Maurice Wolf Flinker) was a [[Jew]]ish youth born in [[The Hague]] on October 9, 1926 and killed in [[Auschwitz]] by the [[Nazi Regime]] in 1944. He was the son of Eliezer Noah Flinker of Poland, who had migrated to the Netherlands and subsequently become a wealthy businessman. Following the 1940 [[Battle of the Netherlands]], the family left [[The Hague]] for [[Belgium]] to evade [[Nazi]] rule and the rounding up of [[Jews]] by the [[Gestapo]]. The Flinkers stayed in [[Brussels]], Belgium until their arrest in 1944. Moshe and his parents were deported to [[Auschwitz]] and murdered there.

Flinker began writing a diary in 1941. The diary was saved by his siblings and published in [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] by [[Yad Vashem]] in 1958. An English translation was published by Yad Vashem in 1965, titled ''Young Moshe's Diary'', subtitled ''The spiritual torment of a Jewish boy in Nazi Europe''; a second edition followed in 1971. A [[Yiddish]] translation was published by [[Perets]], [[Tel Aviv]] in 1965, titled ''Dos yingl Moyshe: Dos togbukh fun Moyshe Flinker''. A [[German (language)|German]] translation was published in 2008 under the title ''Auch wenn ich hoffe: Das Tagebuch des Moshe Flinker'' by Berlin University Press.
