'''Aesthetics''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|s|ˈ|θ|ɛ|t|ɪ|k|s|,_|i:|s|-}}) is a branch of [[philosophy]] that explores the nature of [[art]], [[beauty]], and [[taste (sociology)|taste]], with the creation and appreciation of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Aesthetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its more technical [[Epistemology|epistemological]] perspective, it is defined as the study of subjective and [[senses|sensori-emotional values]], sometimes called [[judgement|judgment]]s of [[Feeling|sentiment]] and taste.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Nick. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/ Aesthetic Judgment]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', 02-28-2003/10-22-2007. Retrieved 07-24-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetics studies how artists imagine, create and perform works of art; how people use, enjoy, and criticize art; and what happens in their minds when they look at paintings, listen to music, or read poetry, and understand what they see and hear. It also studies how they feel about art—why they like some works and not others, and how art can affect their moods, beliefs, and attitude toward life.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munro, "Aesthetics", The World Book Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, ed. A. Richard Harmet, et. al., (Chicago: Merchandise Mart Plaza, 1986), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as "critical reflection on art, culture and [[nature]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1998) p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/adx.18.2.27949030|title =  Review of ''ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AESTHETICS 4 vol.''

==Etymology==
The word ''aesthetic'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang |grc|αἰσθητικός}} (''aisthetikos'', meaning "esthetic, sensitive, sentient, pertaining to sense perception"), which in turn was derived from αἰσθάνομαι (''aisthanomai'', meaning "I perceive, feel, sense" and related to {{lang |grc|αἴσθησις}} (''aisthēsis'', "sensation").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD |aesthetic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "aesthetics" was appropriated and coined with new meaning by the German philosopher [[Alexander Baumgarten]] in his dissertation ''Meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus'' ("Philosophical considerations of some matters pertaining the poem") in 1735;&lt;ref name= "Guyer 2005"&gt;{{cite book |last = Guyer |first =Paul |title= Values of Beauty: Historical Essays in Aesthetics |date= 13 June 2005 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0-521-60669-1 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Bje-QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Baumgarten chose "aesthetics" because he wished to emphasize the experience of art as a means of knowing. Aesthetics, a not very tidy intellectual discipline, is a heterogeneous collection of problems that concern the arts primarily but also relate to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = George | last = T. Dickie | title = aesthetics | work = Encyclopedia Americana | volume = 1 | editor1-first = Barbara | editor1-last = Letta Cole | editor2 = et. al. | place = Danbury | publisher = Grolier | year = 1993 | page = 234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; even though his later definition in the fragment ''Aesthetica'' (1750) is more often referred to as the first definition of modern aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = N | last = Wilson | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8pXhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 | title = Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece | page = 20 | publisher = Routledge | date = 31 Oct 2013 | ISBN = 1-136-78800-X | accessdate = 2015-05-12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics and the philosophy of art==
{{quotation|Aesthetics is for the artist as [[Ornithology]] is for the birds.|[[Barnett Newman]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php Barnett Newman Foundation, Chronology, 1952] Retrieved 30 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Abuse of Beauty: Aesthetics and the Concept of Art'', By Arthur Coleman Danto, p.1, Published by Open Court Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8126-9540-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8126-9540-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For some, aesthetics is considered a synonym for the philosophy of art since [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], while others insist that there is a significant distinction between these closely related fields. In practice, aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an [[art object]]), while artistic judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an [[work of art|art work]].

Philosophical aesthetics has not only to speak about art and to produce judgments about art works, but also has to give a [[definition]] of what art is. Art is an [[autonomous]] entity for philosophy, because art deals with the [[senses]] (i. e. the etymology of aesthetics) and art is as such free of any moral or political purpose. Hence, there are two different conceptions of art in aesthetics: art as [[knowledge]] or art as action, but aesthetics is neither [[epistemology]] nor ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert]], ''Introduction to Aesthetics'' (''Einführung in die Ästhetik''), Munich, Wilhelm Fink, 1995, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aestheticians compare historical developments with theoretical approaches to the arts of many periods. They study the varieties of art in relation to their physical, social, and culture environments. Aestheticians also use psychology to understand how people see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and act in relation to the materials and problems of art. Aesthetic psychology studies the creative process and the aesthetic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munro, "aesthetics", The World Book Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, ed. A. Richard Harmet, et. al., (Chicago: Merchandise Mart Plaza, 1986), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic judgment, universals and ethics==

===Aesthetic judgment&lt;!--'Aesthetic judgment' redirects here--&gt;===

Aesthetics examines our [[Bloom's taxonomy#The affective domain (emotion-based)|affective domain]] response to an object or phenomenon Judgments of aesthetic value rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level. However, '''aesthetic judgments'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; usually go beyond sensory discrimination.

For [[David Hume]], delicacy of taste is not merely "the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition", but also our sensitivity "to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''Essays Moral, Political, Literary'', Indianapolis: Literary Fund, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for [[pleasure]].

For [[Immanuel Kant]]  (''[[Critique of Judgment]]'', 1790), "enjoyment" is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but [[The Critique of Judgment|judging something]] to be "beautiful" has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once. Kant (1790) observed of a man "If he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to ''me''," because "Everyone has his own ([[sense]] of) [[taste]]". The case of "beauty" is different from mere "agreeableness" because, "If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things." [[Roger Scruton]] has argued similarly.

Viewer interpretations of beauty may on occasion be observed to possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste. Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty. Taste is a result of an education process and awareness of elite cultural values learned through exposure to [[mass culture]]. Bourdieu examined how the elite in society define the aesthetic values like taste and how varying levels of exposure to these values can result in variations by class, cultural background, and education.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1984). Distinction. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-674-21277-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant, beauty is subjective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|title=Aesthetic Judgment|publisher=|accessdate=|last = Zangwill|first = Nick|work = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date = 26 August 2014|editor-last = Zalta|editor-first = Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], there are six conditions for the presentation of art: beauty, form, representation, reproduction of reality, artistic expression and innovation. However, one may not be able to pin down these qualities in a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Władysław|last = Tatarkiewicz|title = A History of Six Ideas: an essay in aesthetics |date = 1980|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/A_history_of_six_ideas.html?id=eD4qAQAAMAAJ|publisher=PWN/Polish Scientific Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Factors involved in aesthetic judgment====
[[File:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg|thumb|[[Rainbow]]s often have aesthetic appeal.]]

Judgments of aesthetical values seem often to involve many other kinds of issues as well. Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in [[instinct]]ual ways to [[facial expression]]s, and even behaviours like the [[gag reflex]]. Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man's beard is disgusting even though neither [[soup]] nor [[beard]]s are themselves disgusting. Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions. For example, the [[awe]] inspired by a [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] landscape might physically manifest with an increased heart-rate or pupil dilation; physiological reaction may express or even cause the initial awe. As seen, emotions are conformed to 'cultural' reactions, therefore aesthetics is always characterized by 'regional responses', as Francis Grose was the first to affirm in his ‘Rules for Drawing Caricaturas: With an Essay on Comic Painting’ (1788), published in W. Hogarth, The Analysis of Beauty, Bagster, London s.d. (1791? [1753]), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–24. Grose can therefore be claimed to be the first critical 'aesthetic regionalist' in proclaiming the anti-universality of aesthetics in contrast to the perilous and always resurgent dictatorship of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Yvonne|last = Bezrucka|title = The Invention of Northern Aesthetics in 18th-Century English Literature |date = 2017|url = http://www.cambridgescholars.com/the-invention-of-northern-aesthetics-in-18th-century-english-literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent. [[Victorian Era|Victorians]] in Britain often saw [[African sculpture]] as ugly, but just a few decades later, [[Edwardian Era|Edwardian]] audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful. Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to [[Human sexuality|sexual]] desirability. Thus, judgments of [[Architectural design values|aesthetic value]] can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or [[morality|moral]] value.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and [[Industrial design]]: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a current context, one might judge a [[Lamborghini]] to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last = Korsmeyer |editor-first = Carolyn |title =Aesthetics: The Big Questions|date = 1998|publisher =Wiley-Blackwell |isbn = 978-0631205944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory. Likewise aesthetic judgments seem often to be at least partly intellectual and interpretative. It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging. Modern aestheticians have asserted that [[free will|will]] and [[Desire (emotion)|desire]] were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet [[preference]] and [[choice]] have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th-century thinkers. The point is already made by [[David Hume|Hume]], but see Mary Mothersill, "Beauty and the Critic's Judgment", in The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics, 2004. Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behaviour, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs.

A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are unified across art forms. For instance, the source of a painting's beauty has a different character to that of beautiful music, suggesting their aesthetics differ in kind.&lt;ref&gt;Consider Clement Greenberg's arguments in "On Modernist Painting" (1961), reprinted in Aesthetics: A Reader in Philosophy of Arts.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinct inability of language to express aesthetic judgment and the role of [[Social constructionism|Social construction]] further cloud this issue.

===Aesthetic universals===
The philosopher [[Denis Dutton]] identified six universal signatures in human aesthetics:&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton]]'s ''Aesthetic Universals'' summarized by [[Steven Pinker]] in ''[[The Blank Slate]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

# Expertise or virtuosity. Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills.
# Nonutilitarian pleasure. People enjoy art for art's sake, and do not demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.
# [[Style (visual arts)|Style]]. Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.
# Criticism. People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.
# Imitation. With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.
# Special focus. Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.

Artists such as Hirschhorn have indicated that there are too many exceptions to Dutton's categories. For example, the installations of the contemporary artist [[Thomas Hirschhorn]] deliberately eschew technical virtuosity. People can appreciate a Renaissance [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions. "Rules of composition" that might be read into [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' or [[John Cage]]'s ''[[4′33″]]'' do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works' realization). Moreover, some of Dutton's categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory. Another problem is that Dutton's categories seek to universalize traditional European notions of aesthetics and art forgetting that, as André Malraux and others have pointed out, there have been large numbers of cultures in which such ideas (including the idea "art" itself) were non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art''. (Amsterdam: Rodopi. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic ethics===
Aesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive. [[John Dewey]]&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1932)'Ethics', with James Tufts. In: '' The Collected Works of John Dewey, 1882–1953 '' Edited Jo-Ann Boydston: Carbonsdale: Southern Illinois University Press. p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact reflected in our understanding of behaviour being "fair"—the word having a double meaning of attractive and morally acceptable. More recently, [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoagepub.com/products/content/p478d75b79b1ea.php Peace Education - Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations] infoagepub.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/|title=Peace Education : Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations|first=Page, James|last=S.|date=22 October 2017|website=eprints.qut.edu.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical rationale for [[peace education]].

==New Criticism and ''The Intentional Fallacy''==
During the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work.  For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B., et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms' assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaut|first1=Berys|last2=  Livingston|first2 = Paisley|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7r27dci51FcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title =The Creation of Art| page = 3|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date =2003|isbn = 9780521812344}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from [[Formalism (art)|formalists]] stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"/&gt;

==Derivative forms of aesthetics==
A large number of derivative forms of aesthetics have developed as contemporary and transitory forms of inquiry associated with the field of aesthetics which include the post-modern, psychoanalytic, scientific, and mathematical among others.

===Post-modern aesthetics and psychoanalysis===
[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|left|Example of the [[Dada]] aesthetic, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''Fountain'' 1917]]

Early-twentieth-century artists, poets and composers challenged existing notions of beauty, broadening the scope of art and aesthetics. In 1941, [[Eli Siegel]], American philosopher and poet, founded [[Aesthetic Realism]], the philosophy that reality itself is aesthetic, and that "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green |first=Edward |title=Donald Francis Tovey, Aesthetic Realism and the Need for a Philosophic Musicology |publisher=International Revue of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music |year= 2005 |page= 227 |jstor=30032170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegel |first= Eli |title=Is Beauty the Making One of Opposites? |publisher=''Journal of Aesthetics &amp; Art Criticism |year= 1955 |jstor=425879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various attempts have been made to define [[Post-Modern]] Aesthetics. The challenge to the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify "beauty" into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime. What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the [[Rococo]].

[[Benedetto Croce|Croce]] suggested that "expression" is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central. [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Aesthetic Attitude|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aesth-at/|last = King|first = Alexandra|work = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marshall McLuhan]] suggested that art always functions as a "counter-environment" designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grosswiler|first1=Paul|title=Transforming McLuhan: Cultural, Critical, and Postmodern Perspectives|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|isbn=978-1-4331-1067-2|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I19crS0qJ78C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=mcluhan+on+art+as+counter-environment#v=onepage&amp;q=mcluhan%20on%20art%20as%20counter-environment&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Adorno]] felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience. [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]] attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in ''The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture''. [[Arthur Danto]] has described this reaction as "kalliphobia" (after the Greek word for beauty, κάλλος ''kallos'').&lt;ref&gt;'Kalliphobia in Contemporary Art' in ''Art Journal'' v. 63 no. 2 (Summer 2004) p.&amp;nbsp;24–35&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Malraux]] explains that the notion of beauty was connected to a particular conception of art that arose with the Renaissance and was still dominant in the eighteenth century (but was supplanted later). The discipline of aesthetics, which originated in the eighteenth century, mistook this transient state of affairs for a revelation of the permanent nature of art.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Massumi]] suggests to reconsider beauty following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]].&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, Brian, (ed.), A Shock to Thought. Expression after Deleuze and Guattari. London &amp; NY: Routeledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-23804-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walter Benjamin echoed Malraux in believing aesthetics was a comparatively recent invention, a view proven wrong in the late 1970s, when Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake analyzed links between beauty, information processing, and information theory. [[Denis Dutton]] in "The Art Instinct" also proposed that an aesthetic sense was a vital evolutionary factor.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]] re-invokes the Kantian distinction between [[taste (sociology)|taste]] and the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. Sublime painting, unlike [[kitsch]] [[realism (visual arts)|realism]], "...&amp;nbsp;will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing pain."&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-Françoise, ''What is Postmodernism?'', in ''The Postmodern Condition'', Minnesota and Manchester, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-Françoise, ''Scriptures: Diffracted Traces'', in Theory, Culture and Society, Volume 21, Number 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] inaugurated aesthetical thinking in [[Psychoanalysis]] mainly via the "Uncanny" as aesthetical affect.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, "The Uncanny" (1919). Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Work of Sigmund Freud, 17:234-36. London: The Hogarth Press&lt;/ref&gt; Following Freud and [[Merleau-Ponty]],&lt;ref&gt;Merleau-Ponty, Maurice (1964), "The Visible and the Invisible". Northwestern University Press. {{ISBN|0-8101-0457-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan]] theorized aesthetics in terms of sublimation and the Thing.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis (The Seminar of Jacques Lacan Book VII), NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation of [[Marxist aesthetics]] to post-modern aesthetics is still a contentious area of debate.

===Recent aesthetics===
[[Guy Sircello]] has pioneered efforts in analytic philosophy to develop a rigorous theory of aesthetics, focusing on the concepts of beauty,&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''A New Theory of Beauty''. Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; love&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''Love and Beauty''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and sublimity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], "How Is a Theory of the Sublime Possible?" ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism''
Vol. 51, No. 4 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 541–550&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to romantic theorists Sircello argued for the objectivity of beauty and formulated a theory of love on that basis.

British philosopher and theorist of [[conceptual art]] aesthetics, [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]], makes the point that "'[[post-conceptual art]]' aesthetic does not concern a particular type of [[contemporary art]] so much as the historical-[[ontological]] condition for the production of contemporary art in general&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All: Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 3 &amp; 51&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne noted that [http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf contemporary art is 'post-conceptual] in a public lecture delivered in 2010.

Gary Tedman has put forward a theory of a subjectless aesthetics derived from [[Karl Marx]]'s concept of alienation, and [[Louis Althusser]]'s antihumanism, using elements of Freud's group psychology, defining a concept of the 'aesthetic level of practice'.&lt;ref&gt;Tedman, G. (2012) ''Aesthetics &amp; Alienation'', Zero Books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregory Loewen]] has suggested that the subject is key in the interaction with the aesthetic object. The work of art serves as a vehicle for the projection of the individual's identity into the world of objects, as well as being the irruptive source of much of what is uncanny in modern life. As well, art is used to memorialize individuated biographies in a manner that allows persons to imagine that they are part of something greater than themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Loewen]], Aesthetic Subjectivity, 2011 pages&amp;nbsp;36–7, 157, 238)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and science===
[[File:Mandel zoom 00 mandelbrot set.jpg|thumb|The [[Mandelbrot set]] with continuously coloured environment]]

The field of [[experimental aesthetics]] was founded by [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] in the 19th century. Experimental aesthetics in these times had been characterized by a [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]-based, [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] approach. The analysis of individual experience and behaviour based on [[experiment|experimental methods]] is a central part of experimental aesthetics. In particular, the perception of works of art,&lt;ref&gt;Kobbert, M. (1986), ''Kunstpsychologie'' ("Psychology of art"), Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt&lt;/ref&gt; music, or modern items such as websites&lt;ref&gt;Thielsch, M. T. (2008), ''Ästhetik von Websites. Wahrnehmung von Ästhetik und deren Beziehung zu Inhalt, Usability und Persönlichkeitsmerkmalen.'' ("The aesthetics of websites. Perception of aesthetics and its relation to content, usability, and personality traits."), MV Wissenschaft, Münster&lt;/ref&gt; or other IT products&lt;ref&gt;Hassenzahl, M. (2008), ''Aesthetics in interactive products: Correlates and consequences of beauty''. In H. N. J. Schifferstein &amp; P. Hekkert (Eds.): ''Product Experience.'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;287–302). Elsevier, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; is studied. Experimental aesthetics is strongly oriented towards the [[natural science]]s. Modern approaches mostly come from the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] or [[neuroscience]] ([[neuroaesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (2007), ''Recent trends in the psychological study of aesthetics, creativity, and the arts''. In ''Empirical Studies of the Arts'', 25(2), p.&amp;nbsp;121–141.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the 1970s, [[Abraham Moles]] and [[Frieder Nake]] were among the first to analyze links between aesthetics, [[information processing]], and [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Moles: ''Théorie de l'information et perception esthétique'', Paris, Denoël, 1973 ([[Information Theory]] and aesthetical perception)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F Nake (1974). Ästhetik als Informationsverarbeitung. (Aesthetics as [[information processing]]). Grundlagen und Anwendungen der Informatik im Bereich ästhetischer Produktion und Kritik. Springer, 1974, {{ISBN|3-211-81216-4}}, {{ISBN|978-3-211-81216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] described an [[algorithm]]ic theory of beauty which takes the [[subjectivity]] of the observer into account and postulates: among several observations classified as comparable by a given subjective observer, the aesthetically most pleasing one is the one with the shortest description, given the observer's previous knowledge and his particular method for encoding the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1576418|title=Low-Complexity Art|first=Jürgen|last=Schmidhuber|date=22 October 1997|publisher=|journal=Leonardo|volume=30|issue=2|pages=97–103|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/1576418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/beauty.html|title=THEORY OF BEAUTY - FACIAL ATTRACTIVENESS - LOW-COMPLEXITY ART|website=www.idsia.ch|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is closely related to the principles of [[algorithmic information theory]] and [[minimum description length]]. One of his examples: [[mathematician]]s enjoy simple proofs with a short description in their [[formal language]]. Another very concrete example describes an aesthetically pleasing human face whose proportions can be described by very few [[bit]]s of information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Jürgen Schmidhuber|first =Jürgen |last= Schmidhuber |title = Facial beauty and fractal geometry|website = Cogprint Archive|url =http://cogprints.org/690/1/newlocoface.html |deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130215106/http://cogprints.org/690/1/newlocoface.html |archivedate=30 November 2012 |date = 7 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]]. Simple Algorithmic Principles of Discovery, Subjective Beauty, Selective Attention, Curiosity &amp; Creativity. Proc. 10th Intl. Conf. on Discovery Science (DS 2007) p.&amp;nbsp;26–38, LNAI 4755, Springer, 2007. Also in Proc. 18th Intl. Conf. on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2007) p. 32, LNAI 4754, Springer, 2007. Joint invited lecture for DS 2007 and ALT 2007, Sendai, Japan, 2007. {{arxiv|0709.0674}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing inspiration from less detailed 15th century proportion studies by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Schmidhuber's theory explicitly distinguishes between what's [[Beauty|beautiful]] and what's [[interesting]], stating that interestingness corresponds to the [[first derivative]] of subjectively perceived beauty. Here the premise is that any observer continually tries to improve the [[predictability]] and [[compressibility]] of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and [[symmetries]] and [[fractal]] [[self-similarity]]. Whenever the observer's learning process (which may be a predictive [[artificial neural network]]; see also [[Neuroesthetics]]) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer [[bit]]s than before, the temporary [[interest (emotion)|interest]]ingness of the data corresponds to the number of saved bits. This compression progress is proportional to the observer's internal reward, also called curiosity reward. A [[reinforcement learning]] algorithm is used to maximize future expected reward by learning to execute action sequences that cause additional [[interesting]] input data with yet unknown but learnable predictability or regularity. The principles can be implemented on artificial agents which then exhibit a form of [[Artificial intelligence|artificial]] [[curiosity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]].

===Truth in beauty and mathematics===
Mathematical considerations, such as [[symmetry]] and [[complexity]], are used for analysis in theoretical aesthetics. This is different from the aesthetic considerations of [[applied aesthetics]] used in the study of [[mathematical beauty]]. Aesthetic considerations such as [[symmetry]] and [[Occam's razor|simplicity]] are used in areas of philosophy, such as [[Categorical imperative|ethics]] and [[theoretical physics]] and [[cosmology]] to [[define]] [[truth]], outside of [[empirical]] considerations. Beauty and [[Truth]] have been argued to be nearly synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;Why Beauty Is Truth: The History of Symmetry, [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as reflected in the statement "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" in the poem [[Ode on a Grecian Urn]] by [[John Keats]], or by the Hindu motto "Satyam Shivam Sundaram" (Satya (Truth) is Shiva (God), and Shiva is Sundaram (Beautiful)). The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by [[processing fluency]], which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, R, [[Norbert Schwarz|Schwarz, N]], Winkielman, P: "Processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure: Is beauty in the perceiver's processing experience?", ''Personality and Social Psychology Review'', 8(4):364-382&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, recent research found that people use beauty as an indication for truth in mathematical pattern tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, R, Brun, M, Mitterndorfer, K: "The use of heuristics in intuitive mathematical judgment", ''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review'', 15(6):1174–1178&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientists including the mathematician [[David Orrell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |title=Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order  |location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-300-18661-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and physicist [[Marcelo Gleiser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gleiser|first=Marcelo |title=A Tear at the Edge of Creation: A Radical New Vision for Life in an Imperfect Universe |publisher=Free Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4391-0832-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that the emphasis on aesthetic criteria such as symmetry is equally capable of leading scientists astray.

===Computational approaches===
In 1928, the mathematician [[George David Birkhoff]] created an aesthetic measure ''M = O/C'' as the ratio of order to complexity.&lt;ref name="Akiba2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akiba|first1=Fuminori|title=Preface: Natural Computing and Computational Aesthetics|journal=Natural Computing and Beyond|volume=6|date=2013|pages=117–118|doi=10.1007/978-4-431-54394-7_10|series=Proceedings in Information and Communications Technology|isbn=978-4-431-54393-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since about 2005, computer scientists have attempted to develop automated methods to infer aesthetic quality of images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=R. |last1=Datta |first2=D. |last2=Joshi |first3=J. |last3=Li |first4=J. |last4=Wang |title=Studying aesthetics in photographic images using a computational approach |booktitle=Europ.

The Acquine engine, developed at [[Penn State University]], rates natural photographs uploaded by users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acquine.alipr.com |title=Aesthetic Quality Inference Engine - Instant Impersonal Assessment of Photos |publisher=Penn State University |accessdate=21 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090509101935/http://acquine.alipr.com/| archivedate= 9 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been relatively successful attempts with regard to chess{{explain|date=October 2018}} and music.&lt;ref&gt;Manaris, B., Roos, P., Penousal, M., Krehbiel, D., Pellicoro, L. and Romero, J.; A Corpus-Based Hybrid Approach to Music Analysis and Composition; Proceedings of 22nd Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-07); Vancouver, BC; 839-845 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A relation between [[Max Bense]]'s mathematical formulation of aesthetics in terms of "redundancy" and "complexity" and theories of musical anticipation was offered using the notion of Information Rate.&lt;ref&gt;Dubnov, S.; Musical Information Dynamics as Models of Auditory Anticipation; in Machine Audition: Principles, Algorithms and Systems, Ed. W. Weng, IGI Global publication, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary aesthetics===
{{main|Evolutionary aesthetics}}
Evolutionary aesthetics refers to [[evolutionary psychology]] theories in which the basic aesthetic preferences of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' are argued to have [[evolution|evolved]] in order to enhance survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shimura|first1=Arthur P.|last2=Palmer|first2=Stephen E.|title=Aesthetic Science: Connecting Minds, Brains, and Experience|date=January 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example being that humans are argued to find beautiful and prefer [[landscape]]s which were good [[habitat]]s in the ancestral environment. Another example is that body symmetry and proportion are important aspects of [[physical attractiveness]] which may be due to this indicating good health during body growth. Evolutionary explanations for aesthetical preferences are important parts of [[evolutionary musicology]], [[Darwinian literary studies]], and the study of the [[evolution of emotion]].

===Applied aesthetics===
{{Main|Applied aesthetics}}

As well as being applied to art, aesthetics can also be applied to cultural objects, such as crosses or tools. For example, aesthetic coupling between art-objects and medical topics was made by speakers working for the US Information Agency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Giannini AJ |title=Tangential symbols: using visual symbolization to teach pharmacological principles of drug addiction to international audiences |journal=Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=33 |issue=12 |pages=1139–46 |date=December 1993 |pmid=7510314 |doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.1993.tb03913.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art slides were linked to slides of pharmacological data, which improved attention and retention by simultaneous activation of intuitive right brain with rational left. It can also be used in topics as diverse as [[Mathematical beauty|mathematics]], [[gastronomy]], fashion and website design.&lt;ref&gt;Moshagen, M. &amp; Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 68 (10), 689-709.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/visual_aesthetics.html |title=Visual Aesthetics |publisher=Interaction-design.org |date= |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lavie, T. &amp; Tractinsky, N. (2004). Assessing dimensions of perceived visual aesthetics of web sites. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 60, 269–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The philosophy of aesthetics as a practice has been criticized by some sociologists and writers of art and society. [[Raymond Williams]] argues that there is no unique and or individual aesthetic object which can be extrapolated from the art world, but that there is a continuum of cultural forms and experience of which ordinary speech and experiences may signal as art. By "art" we may frame several artistic "works" or "creations" as so though this reference remains within the institution or special event which creates it and this leaves some works or other possible "art" outside of the frame work, or other interpretations such as other phenomenon which may not be considered as "art".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] disagrees with Kant's idea of the "aesthetic". He argues that Kant's "aesthetic" merely represents an experience that is the product of an elevated class habitus and scholarly leisure as opposed to other possible and equally valid "aesthetic" experiences which lay outside Kant's narrow definition.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Timothy Laurie argues that theories of musical aesthetics "framed entirely in terms of appreciation, contemplation or reflection risk idealizing an implausibly unmotivated listener defined solely through musical objects, rather than seeing them as a person for whom complex intentions and motivations produce variable attractions to cultural objects and practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Music Genre As Method | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Cultural Studies Review | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511}} 20 (2), pp.&amp;nbsp;283–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Armenian art''' is the unique form of art developed over the last five millennia in which the [[Armenian people]] lived on the [[Armenian Highland]].  Armenian architecture and miniature painting have dominated Armenian art and have shown consistent development over the centuries.&lt;ref name="ArtsOfArmenia-Introduction"&gt;{{Arts of Armenia|chapter=Introduction|chapterurl=http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/arts_of_armenia/introduction.htm}} {{cite web|url=http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/arts_of_armenia/introduction.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530143752/http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/arts_of_armenia/introduction.htm |archivedate=May 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of Armenian art include sculpture, fresco, mosaic, ceramic, metalwork, engraving, and textiles, especially [[Armenian carpet]]s.

[[Prehistoric Armenia]] was home to the [[Urartu]] culture in the [[Iron Age]], notable for its early metal sculptures, often of animals. The region was, as later, often contested by the large empires holding the nearby regions of [[Persia]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Anatolia]], and these all had considerable influence of Armenian art.  The Armenians adopted Christianity very early, and developed their own version of [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] art, with much use of [[icon]]s, [[Armenian miniature]]s in books, and the very original [[Armenian church architecture|architecture]] of their churches and monasteries.  A distinctive Armenian feature, which may have influenced the [[Medieval art]] of Europe, was the popularity from early on of figurative [[relief]] carvings on the outside of churches, unknown in [[Byzantium]]. 

Armenians specialized in arts and crafts such as [[Armenian carpet|carpet]]-weaving.

== Study of Armenian art history ==
The study of Armenian art began in the early 20th century.  Notable scholars of Armenian art were [[Catholicos Garegin Hovsepian]] and professor [[Sirarpie Der Nerséssian]].&lt;ref name="ArtsOfArmenia-Introduction"/&gt;  More recently, [[Jean-Michel Thierry]] and Professor [[Dickran Kouymjian]] are prominent scholars of Armenian art.

== Architecture ==
{{Main|Armenian architecture}}
The first Armenian churches were built during the lifetime of [[St. Gregory the Illuminator]], were often built on the sites of destroyed pagan temples, and imitated some aspects of Armenian pre-Christian architecture.&lt;ref name="tacentral"&gt;[http://www.tacentral.com/architecture.asp?story_no=2 Sacred Geometry and Armenian Architecture | Armenia Travel, History, Archeology &amp; Ecology | TourArmenia | Travel Guide to Armenia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical and Medieval Armenian architecture is divided into four separate periods.

The first period, from the 4th to the 7th centuries, began with Armenia's conversion to Christianity, and ended after the Arab invasions of Armenia. The early churches were mostly simple [[basilica]]s, some with side apses. By the 5th century the typical cupola cone in the center had become widely used. By the 7th century, centrally-planned churches had been built and the more complicated ''niched buttress'' and radiating ''Hrip'simé'' style had formed. By the time of the Arab invasions, most of what we now know as classical Armenian architecture had formed.

The second period lasted from the 9th to the 11th centuries. Armenian architecture underwent a revival under the patronage of the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratid]] dynasty with many buildings erected in the regions of [[Ani]] and [[Lake Van]]: these included both traditional styles and new innovations. Ornately carved Armenian [[khachkars]] were developed during this time.&lt;ref name="past"&gt;Armenia, Past and Present; Elisabeth Bauer, Jacob Schmidheiny, Frederick Leist , 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Many new cities and churches were built during this time, including a new capital at [[Lake Van]] and a [[Cathedral on Akdamar Island]] to match. The [[Cathedral of Ani]] was also completed during this dynasty. It was during this time that the first major monasteries, such as [[Haghpat Monastery|Haghpat]]  and [[Haritchavank Monastery|Haritchavank]] were founded. This period was ended by the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] invasion.

== Miniatures ==
{{Main|Armenian illuminated manuscripts}}
[[File:Matenadaran Gospel313 Last Supper.jpg|right|thumb|The Last Supper, from the illuminated manuscript, end of the 14th century, Artsakh]]
Illuminated manuscripts were produced in Armenia mainly between the 5th and the 17th centuries. The highest point of this art is associated with the 13th century and the name of [[Toros Roslin]], considered to be the most prominent medieval Armenian manuscript illuminator. The majority of the manuscripts were lost, and scholarly approach to studies of Armenian illuminated manuscripts was only developed in the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vremennik.biz/sites/all/files/002_%D0%A2.%20%D0%90.%20%D0%98%20%D0%B7%20%D0%BC%20%D0%B0%20%D0%B9%20%D0%BB%20%D0%BE%20%D0%B2%20%D0%B0%20.%20%28%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%29%20%D0%A0%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%83%20%D0%9B.%20%D0%90.%20%D0%94%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE_0.pdf|title=Рецензия: Л.

== Sculptures ==
[[Image:Jugha-khachkar-CIMG1581.JPG|thumb|right|Late-medieval Armenian [[Khachkars]] from [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]]|150px]]
{{Main|Khachkar}}
Each culture possesses a certain original element which becomes a symbol of the entire national culture. In Armenia such symbol is “''[[khachkar]]'', the so-called cross-stones, the monuments of Armenia which are not found anywhere in the world. The word “khachkar” is formed by two Armenian roots: “khach” (cross) and "kar" (stone). Armenia has been called “a country of rocks” and has a rich heritage when it comes to sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://araratour.com/the-monuments-and-sculptures-of-yerevan/|title=The Monuments and Sculptures of Yerevan • Arara Tour|date=2016-01-25|work=Arara Tour|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the sculptures in the country date way back even before the formation of Armenia as a nation. Such sculptures were created by empires that existed in the region before the modern period. A good example of these is the “Khachkar” which were ancient religious sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallery.am/en/Armenian/Sculpture/|title=Sculpture|date=|website=National Gallery of Armenia|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these ancient sculptures, Armenia also has plenty of post-war sculptures which show the influence of modern times and also foreign traditions that have been adopted.

== Frescoes, Mosaics, and Ceramics ==
[[Image:Armenian mural of Christ at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|An Armenian fresco of Christ at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]].]]
Ceramics, mosaics, and frescoes constitute a different category of Armenian artwork. The creation of the outlined artifacts dates back to the days of the Urartian Empire that existed long before the establishment of Armenia as a nation. Therefore some of the ancient art is shared among several countries in the region that were part of the Urartian Empire. While the evidence of these forms of art was realized through excavations in the country, their remains have been reconstructed thus providing physical evidence of what they looked like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fresnostate.edu/artshum/armenianstudies/resources/frescoesmosaicceramics.html|title=Frescoes, Mosaics, and Ceramica|last=|first=|date=|website=Fresno State|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Metalwork and Engravings ==
[[Image:Akdamar Church.JPG|thumb|right|Biblical scenes carved into the external wall of the 10th-century Cathedral of the Holy Cross on [[Akhtamar Island]] on [[Lake Van]]]] 
Armenia has a history of making engravings and metalwork which are also considered as part of the art. Artifacts in this category can be subdivided into coins, silver and gold, and bronze and tinned copper.&lt;ref name="ArtsOfArmenia-Introduction" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fresnostate.edu/artshum/armenianstudies/resources/metalworkengraving.html|title=Metalwork and Engraving|last=|first=|date=|website=Fresno State|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coins refer to the pieces of metals that were designed during the ancient times for trading purposes between Armenia and its neighbors such as Greece. On the other hand, gold and silver were luxury items during ancient Armenia which were fashioned in various ways such as drinking vessels, medallions, and statues just to mention a few. Besides, tinned copper and bronze were also used. Excavations in the country have revealed that these were used to make household items, weapons, and even statues.

== Textiles ==
{{Main|Armenian dress}}
Textiles are another part of Armenian art and also a significant part of their economy both in the ancient and present times. One of the most extensive collections of Armenian textiles can be found in the Armenian Museum of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armenianmuseum.org/collection/textiles/|title=Textiles|last=|first=|date=|website=Fresno State|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the current world, textile products from Armenia are a major trade commodity between Armenia, Europe, and America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.armenianmuseum.org/collection/textiles/|title=Textiles|last=|first=|date=|work=Armenian Museum of America|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Armenian carpets ===
{{main|Armenian carpet}}
{{Main|Karabakh carpet}}

== Music and dance ==
{{Main|Music of Armenia}}
{{Main|Armenian dance}}
Dance and Music are also an essential aspect of the Armenian Heritage. Initially, Armenian music consisted of Armenian Church music and folk songs that were based on an indigenous tonal system (Tetrachords) as opposed to the European tonal system. However, in the present time, other genres of music have influenced Armenian music thus resulting in the production of modern styles in the country such as Hip Hop, Pop, Rock, among many others. Accompanying original Armenian songs was Armenian dance. Native Armenian dance is one of the oldest practices of the inhabitants of the region. Armenian dance is even depicted in some of the ancient paintings on rocks.

== Contemporary Art == 
In 2015, Armenia won the Leone d'Oro for Best Pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/56th-venice-biennale-highlights/?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the above-discussed art categories, Armenia also has well developed contemporary art which is overseen by the Biennale Foundation. The Foundation is responsible for organizing exhibitions in the country which are termed as Art Biennale. The name is used so as to distinguish its exhibitions from other shows conducted by different organizations. The institution has been doing its activities that date back from 1948 to date.

'''Arts NSW''' (ANSW) is an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]] responsible for administering the government's policies that support the arts, artists and the various cultural bodies within the state of [[New South Wales]] in [[Australia]]. Arts NSW is led by its Executive Director, Mary Darwell, who reports to the [[Departmental secretary|Secretary]] of the [[Department of Justice (New South Wales)|Department of Justice]], Andrew Cappie-Wood.  The agency advises the [[Minister for the Arts (New South Wales)|Minister for the Arts]], presently [[The Honourable|the Hon.]] [[Don Harwin]] {{small|[[Legislative Council of New South Wales|MLC]]}}, who is ultimately responsible to the [[Parliament of New South Wales]]. 

==History==
The role of an 'arts' minister, overseeing the management and support for all cultural activities in New South Wales, before the early 1970s was an unheard of concept in politics. However, by the early 1970s, various governments in Australia recognised the need for a steering authority for state support for the arts. In response, premier [[Bob Askin]] appointed [[George Freudenstein]] as the first Minister for Cultural Activities on 11 March 1971. On his appointment Freudenstein requested the establishment of an organisation to enable him to carry out his responsibilities and the Premier agreed. On 13 May 1971 the '''Ministry of Cultural Activities''' was established, taking over responsibility for various legislation and bodies that had previously been under the purview of the [[Department of Education (New South Wales)|Department of Education]], including the [[NSW State Records|Archives Office of New South Wales]], [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]], [[State Library of New South Wales]], [[Australian Museum]], [[Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences]], [[Sydney Observatory]], the Advisory Committee on Cultural Grants, [[Screen NSW|NSW Film Council]], and the [[Sydney Opera House]] Trust. In the case of the opera house, the Ministry had responsibility for its completion and final official opening on 20 October 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Cultural Activities |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/404 |website=NSW State Records |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=18 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930083450/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/404 |archivedate=30 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Freudenstein's departure on 3 January 1975, a new Minister for Culture, Sport and Recreation was appointed and on 6 January 1975, the Ministry of Cultural Activities was replaced by the new '''Department of Culture, Sport and Recreation'''.&lt;ref name=CSR&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Culture, Sport and Recreation |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/403 |website=NSW State Records |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=18 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930180811/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/403 |archivedate=30 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement lasted until 14 May 1976 when the new Labor Government of [[Neville Wran]] transferred the responsibility for cultural activities to the [[Department of Premier and Cabinet (New South Wales)|Premier's Department]]. This became the '''Cultural Activities Division''' under the administration of the Premier himself.&lt;ref name=CSR/&gt; This situation continued until 1984, when Wran established the '''Office of the Minister for the Arts''' within the Premier's Department and commissioned himself with the title of Minister for the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Division of Cultural Activities (1976-1984) Office of the Minister for the Arts (1984-1988) |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/3629 |website=NSW State Records |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=29 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929221355/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/3629 |archivedate=29 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 1988 a '''Ministry for the Arts''' independent of the Premier's Department was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry for the Arts |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/3630 |website=NSW State Records |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=18 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929221445/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/3630 |archivedate=29 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ministry was abolished on 3 March 2006 and its responsibilities were moved to the new '''[[New South Wales Department of the Arts, Sport and Recreation|Department of the Arts, Sport and Recreation]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of the Arts, Sport and Recreation |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/5059 |website=NSW State Records |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=18 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929203818/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/5059 |archivedate=29 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Arts NSW''' became the new dedicated division for the Minister and it transferred to "Communities NSW" in July 2009 and then the "[[Department of Industry, Skills and Regional Development (New South Wales)|Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services]]" from 4 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arts NSW |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/6374 |website=NSW State Records |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=18 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929221409/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/6374 |archivedate=29 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the appointment of [[Troy Grant]] as the minister in 2014 (who also served as the [[Minister for Police and Emergency Services (New South Wales)#Police|Minister for Police]] and [[Minister for Justice (New South Wales)#Justice|Minister for Justice]]), Arts NSW has been within the Department of Justice.

In the debate on the [[Ethics of cloning|morality of human cloning]], Christians take multiple positions. Since [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly]] the sheep was successfully cloned on 5 July 1996, and the possibility of cloning humans became a reality, Christian leaders have been pressed to take an ethical stance on its [[morality]]. While many Christians tend to disagree with the practice, such as [[Roman Catholics]] and a majority of [[fundamentalist]] pastors, including [[Southern Baptists]], the views taken by various other [[Christian denominations]] are diverse and often conflicting.&lt;ref name=Weasel&gt;Weasel, Lisa H., and Eric Jensen. "Language and Values in the Human Cloning Debate: A Web-based Survey of Scientists and Christian Fundamentalist Pastors." New Genetics and Society 24.1 (2005): 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hard to pinpoint any one, definite stance of the Christian religion, since there are so many [[Christian denominations]] and so few official statements from each of them concerning the morality of human cloning.

There are certain [[Protestant denominations]] that do not disagree with the acceptability of [[human cloning]]. Mary Seller, for example, a member of the Church of England's Board of Social Responsibility and a professor of developmental genetics, states, "Cloning, like all science, must be used responsibly. Cloning humans is not desirable. But cloning sheep has its uses."&lt;ref name=Weasel/&gt; On the other hand, according to a survey of Christian fundamentalist pastors, responses indicated a "common account of human cloning as primarily reproductive in nature, proscribed by its violation of God's will and role."&lt;ref name=Weasel/&gt; Many of these pastors acknowledged the reason for this violation being rooted in the religiously motivated view that human cloning is an example of scientists 'playing God.'"&lt;ref name=Weasel/&gt; It is not only this that many Christians are concerned about, however; other concerns include whether the dignity of the human person is overlooked, as well as the role of the parents as co-creators. All of these things may contribute to why many fundamentalist Christian pastors see human reproductive cloning as simply "forbidden territory."&lt;ref name=Weasel/&gt;

==Understanding Cloning==

Some scientists do argue that the puberty of views comes from the differing understandings of what exactly [[human cloning]] is. In Weasel and Jensen's survey on "Language and Values," they found that Christian pastors used a "consistent emphasis on [[DNA]]."&lt;ref name=Weasel/&gt; Scientists describing the same processes used terminology such as, "insert an isolated [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] from the donor to produce a dividing and viable [[embryo]]" into an enulceated egg"&lt;ref name=Weasel/&gt; One reason why Christian [[fundamentalist]] pastors would be more apt to use terminology which includes "[[DNA]]" more prominently is that DNA is a "value-laden" term which carries religious significance.&lt;ref name=Weasel/&gt; Therefore, not only is DNA often equated, in religious circles, with one's genetic identity, but also with one's singular, "God-given" identity.

===Therapeutic Cloning===

Another point of misunderstanding arises in the separation of human [[reproductive cloning]] and [[therapeutic cloning]]. While most Christians do not support reproductive cloning, therapeutic cloning is a branch of cloning which has garnered slightly more support from certain denominations. Some Christian traditions, such as the [[United Church of Christ]], believe that cloning can be conducted ethically for this purpose, in order to help treat disease and improve the public health, as they do not see the fertilized [[ovum]] as constituting a person. Courtney Campbell, director of the Program for Ethics, Science and the Environment at [[Oregon State University]], says, "Some traditions and leading figures in conservative Protestantism who were opposed to human cloning for reproductive reasons have come to see that given the ambiguity about their own views about the status of embryonic life, and given the potential for health benefits, they could be opposed to reproductive cloning, but affirm therapeutic cloning.&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;Sullivan, Bob. "Beyond Dolly: Human Cloning; Religions Reveal Little Consensus on Human Cloning." ''msnbc.com.'' 25 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason, she says, is the tradition of emphasizing the individual choice over central dogma.

Catholic support for therapeutic cloning is conditional on the stipulation that it does not involve any kind of infringement upon human embryos. [[John Paul II]] states, "These techniques, insofar as they involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, are not morally acceptable, even when their proposed goal is good in itself."&lt;ref name=Delegation&gt;John Paul II. Intervention by the Holy See Delegation at the Special Committee of the 57th General Assembly of the United Nations on Human Embryonic Cloning. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to the Catholic ethical system, even a good that might come from therapeutic cloning would be morally unacceptable, as it would be the result of an act which, according to Catholics, is itself intrinsically immoral. This, for many Christians, is hard to abide by, for, as one Professor of Christian Ethics states, "our society is preoccupied with death and the pursuit of health seems to justify anything."&lt;ref name= Fink&gt;Fink, Rachel. “Cloning, Stem Cells, and the Current National Debate: Incorporating Ethics into a Large Introductory Biology Course.” Cell Biology Education. 1.132-144 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of England]] put out a statement on the Church's website which reads, "human reproductive cloning was made unlawful by the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990]]. Few members of the Church of England would dissent from such a position. However, therapeutic cloning may be thought of as ethical, as it does not result in another human being."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/medical-ethics-health-social-care-policy/hfea/cloning.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while reproductive cloning is again discouraged, therapeutic cloning is more acceptable.

In a statement given by the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], on the other hand, therapeutic cloning was rejected as "contrary to the Word of God and our 1998 resolution.".&lt;ref name=Lutheran&gt;Kieschnick, Rev. Gerald B. “Statement on Cloning.” Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. http://www.nprcouncil.org/pressreleases/cloning-lutheran.htm&lt;/ref&gt; For this particular group, therapeutic cloning is assumed to involve the destruction of human embryos, and is therefore against the [[Synod]]'s resolution to "reaffirm and celebrate life," and "protect the sanctity of human life."&lt;ref name=Lutheran/&gt;

==Dignity of the Human Person==

Christian organizations are challenged to respond to a number of concerns about the issue of the [[dignity]] of the human person, especially in relation to scientific study. Much of the debate has to do with the question of at what point the [[soul]] enters the body. Catholics believe that the soul enters the body at the moment of conception when the [[sperm]] and [[egg (biology)|egg]] unite.&lt;ref name="Mlsna"&gt;

[[Online Computer Library Center|OCLC]]:{{OCLC|54703225}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Catholics and other Christian denominations that share this belief may see embryonic cloning as tantamount to live human experimentation and therefore contrary to God's will.

Most Christians believe that a person has intrinsic [[dignity]] based on his being created in the image and likeness of [[God]] and in his call to communion with God.&lt;ref name= Spes&gt;Second Vatican Council, ''Gaudium et spes'': The Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; This brings the question of the [[morality]] of [[human cloning]] into a realm beyond that of [[science]], and into that of [[religion]], as this dignity cannot be [[empirically]] proven.

===Defining Dignity===

Many Christians that do not agree on an exact definition of "[[dignity]]," which leads some scientists to ignore this concern, seeing it as a vague excuse that some Christians use to justify cloning bans&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield, Timothy. "Human Cloning Laws, Human Dignity and the Poverty of the Policy Making Dialogue." BMC Medical Ethics 3.4 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Or, if a definition is agreed upon, it may be challenged as being too weak, so that, according to Steven Pinker, a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, it is "hardly up to the heavyweight moral demands assigned to it."&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven. “The Stupidity of Dignity.” The New Republic. (2008) http://www.tnr.com/article/the-stupidity-dignity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in intrinsic [[dignity]], nonetheless, leads the Christians who hold this belief to also argue that if the [[soul]] enters the body at the moment when the [[sperm]] and the [[egg (biology)|egg]] unite, producing cloned [[zygotes]] that are unlikely to survive is equivalent to murder. Therefore, if one believes, as Catholics do, that the zygotes have souls and are therefore human, in the words of [[John Paul II]], "regardless of the objective for which it was done, human embryonic cloning conflicts with the international legal norms that protect human dignity."&lt;ref name=Delegation/&gt; Some Christian conservatives even express concern that cloned embryos would have no soul, since it is, in their view, born outside of God's parameters,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spreadinglight.com/contemporary/cloning.html&lt;/ref&gt; as its creation is in a laboratory setting rather than natural conception.

Certain Christians also hold that, in the act of creating a human being, his or her dignity is also upheld by the presence of a loving union between the two partners, so that "only when love exists should the creation of other persons be envisaged."&lt;ref name= Calum&gt;MacKellar, Calum. "Creation- A Bond of Love?" Science &amp; Christian Belief 16.1 (2004), 52&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, "divine creation and co-creation are similar."&lt;ref name=Calum/&gt; In the act of scientific [[cloning]], however, the [[embryo]] is a result of the artificial union of the [[sperm]] and the [[egg (biology)|egg]], so that "the presence of love between the co-creators does not exist."&lt;ref name= Calum/&gt; Thus, according to this view, the dignity of the person is not upheld. Rev. Demetri Demopulos, [[Greek Orthodox]] [[pastor]] and [[geneticist]], states, "As an [[Orthodox Christian]], I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love."

===Playing God===

Much of the concern related to human cloning stems from a fear of overstepping the bounds of the natural order. Through the act of creating another human being, Christians have also posed the question as to whether this would be too much like playing God.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter. "The Intrepid Ethicist." Free Inquiry 20.4 (2000): 44-47&lt;/ref&gt; Not only this, but some Christian [[ethicists]] argue that human cloning would "create substantial issues of identity and individuality."&lt;ref name="Fink"/&gt; This could be seen through the confusion of the child resulting from cloning as to who his parents are, what connection he has to his genetic duplicate, etc.

===Role of Cloning in Society===

Despite the ethical gray area surrounding the act of cloning itself, most, if not all Christians, still hold that children who may result from the process should be loved and cared for as much as any other child, since they would be considered fully human&lt;ref name= Calum/&gt; and therefore reflect the [[Divine]] image, as defined by ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', a document of the Second Vatican Council.&lt;ref name= Spes/&gt; However, according to Richard McCormick, [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], cloning disrupts the familial order. It "would involve removing [[insemination]] and [[fertilization]] from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process."According to Stephen G. Post, a Catholic journalist, "[removal] of the male impregnators from the procreative [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] would simply drive the nail into the coffin of fatherhood, unless one thinks that biological and social fatherhood are utterly disconnected."&lt;ref&gt;Post, Stephen G. "The Judeo-Christian Case Against Human Cloning." ''America'' 176.21 (1997), 20&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotes ==

Rev. Demetri Demopulos, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] pastor and [[geneticist]]:

:"As an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]], I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by [[sexual intercourse|acts of love]] between two people, not through the manipulation of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s in acts that are ultimately about self-love."

Richard McCormick, a [[Jesuit]] priest and professor of Christian [[ethics]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]]:

:"I can’t think of a morally acceptable reason to clone a human being."

Mary Seller, a member of [[Church of England]]'s Board of Social Responsibility and a professor of developmental genetics:

:"Cloning, like all [[science]], must be used responsibly. Cloning humans is not desirable. But cloning [[sheep]] has its uses."

[[Pope John Paul II]]:

:"These techniques, insofar as they involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, are not morally acceptable, even when their proposed goal is good in itself."

[[United Church of Christ]] Committee on [[Genetics]]:

:"It is very likely that [with nuclear transfer cloning], [[scientist]]s could learn a great deal about basic human [[developmental biology]] and that this knowledge might someday lead to treatments for degenerative conditions or to counteract some forms of [[infertility|sterility]]. ... Various [[General Synod]]s of the [[United Church of Christ]] have regarded the human pre-embryo as due great respect [but not] regarded the pre-embryo as the equivalent of a person. Therefore, we ... do not object categorically to human pre-embryo research [under certain conditions]."

Ben Mitchellin, assistant professor of Christian [[ethics]] at [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] Theological Seminary:

:"The time is right for an outright ban on the production of cloned human embryos from [[fertilization]] to [[birth]], regardless of how the research is funded. The vast majority of the American public favors a ban on both privately funded and publicly funded research."

The '''coat of arms of the [[British Antarctic Territory]]''' was first granted in 1952, when the territory was still a [[Falkland Islands Dependencies|dependency]] of the [[Falkland Islands]] (along with [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]).

The arms consist of a shield bearing a flaming torch on a wavy background representing the sea. The dexter [[supporters|supporter]] is a golden lion, representing the [[United Kingdom]]. The sinister supporter is an [[Emperor penguin]], representing the native wildlife in the territory. The lion stands on a [[compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] of grass, while the penguin stands on a compartment of ice. The [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] is a representation of the [[RRS Discovery|RRS ''Discovery'']], the research ship used by [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and [[Ernest Shackleton]] on their first journey to the Antarctic.

The motto is “Research and Discovery”, reflecting the aims of the [[British Antarctic Survey]].

The coat of arms appears in the fly of the [[flag of the British Antarctic Territory]].

[[File:AmbientLED.png|thumb|300px|right|Color rendering index shown as Color Accuracy.]]
A '''color rendering index''' ('''CRI''') is a quantitative measure of the ability of a [[light source]] to reveal the [[color]]s of various objects faithfully in comparison with an ideal or natural light source. Light sources with a high CRI are desirable in color-critical applications such as [[neonatal]] care and art restoration. It is defined by the [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Color rendering''': Effect of an illuminant on the color appearance of objects by conscious or subconscious comparison with their color appearance under a reference illuminant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/17-4-89.html|title=CIE 17.4-1987 International Lighting Vocabulary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The CRI of a light source does not indicate the apparent color of the light source; that information is given by the [[correlated color temperature]] (CCT). The CRI is determined by the light source's [[spectrum]]. An [[incandescent lamp]] has a continuous spectrum, a [[fluorescent lamp]] has a discrete line spectrum; the incandescent lamp has the higher CRI.

The value often quoted as "CRI" on commercially available lighting products is properly called the CIE R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value, "CRI" being a general term and CIE R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; being the international standard color rendering index.

Numerically, the highest possible CIE R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value is 100 and would only be given to a source identical to standardized daylight or a [[black body]] (incandescent lamps are effectively black bodies), dropping to negative values for some light sources. [[Low-pressure sodium light]]ing has negative CRI; fluorescent lights range from about 50 for the basic types, up to about 98 for the best multi-phosphor type. Typical LEDs have about 80+ CRI, while some manufacturers claim that their LEDs have achieved up to 98 CRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ledengin.com/files/products/LZC/LZC-00GW00.pdf|title=LZC-00GW00 Data Sheet|last=|first=|date=March 16, 2015|website=ledengin.com|publisher=LED ENGIN|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIE R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'s ability to predict color appearance has been criticized in favor of measures based on [[color appearance model]]s, such as [[CIECAM02]] and for [[daylight]] simulators, the CIE [[Metamerism Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=János|last1=Schanda|first2=Norbert|last2=Sándor|journal=Lighting Research and Technology|volume=38|issue=3|title=Visual colour rendering based on colour difference evaluations |year=2005|pages=225–239|doi=10.1191/1365782806lrt168oa}}.

&lt;/ref&gt; A newer version of the CRI, R96, has been developed, but it has not replaced the better-known R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; general color rendering index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schanda|first1=Janos|title=Colorimetry: Understanding the CIE System|date=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470175620|pages=212–213|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZadszSGe9MC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=r96+%22color+rendering%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBkoPl-LjRAhVpyVQKHQM2AFkQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=r96%20%22color%20rendering%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Researchers use daylight as the benchmark to which to compare color rendering of electric lights.  In 1948, daylight was described as the ideal source of illumination for good color rendering because "it (daylight) displays (1) a great variety of colours, (2) makes it easy to distinguish slight shades of colour, and (3) the colours of objects around us obviously look natural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=P. J. Bouma|year=1948|title=''Physical aspects of colour; an introduction to the scientific study of colour stimuli and colour sensations''|publisher=(Eindhoven: Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken (Philips Industries) Technical and Scientific Literature Dept.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the middle of the 20th century, color scientists took an interest in assessing the ability of [[artificial light]]s to accurately reproduce colors. European researchers attempted to describe illuminants by measuring the [[spectral power distribution]] (SPD) in "representative" spectral bands, whereas their North American counterparts studied the [[colorimetric]] effect of the illuminants on reference objects.&lt;ref&gt;American approach is expounded in {{harvtxt|Nickerson|1960}}, and the European approach in {{harvtxt|Barnes|1957}}, and {{harvtxt|Crawford|1959}}. See {{harvtxt|Schanda|Sándor|2003}} for a historical overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] assembled a committee to study the matter and accepted the proposal to use the latter approach, which has the virtue of not needing [[spectrophotometry]], with a set of [[Munsell color system|Munsell]] samples. Eight samples of varying hue would be alternately lit with two illuminants, and the color appearance compared. Since no color appearance model existed at the time, it was decided to base the evaluation on color differences in a suitable color space, [[CIE 1964 color space|CIEUVW]]. In 1931, the CIE adopted the first formal system of colorimetry, which is based on the trichromatic nature of the [[human visual system]].&lt;ref name="Color rendering: Beyond pride and prejudice - Rea - 2010 - Color Research &amp;amp; Application - Wiley Online Library" &gt;Rea, M.S., and Freyssinier, J.P.

Deng, and R. Wolsey. 2004. NLPIP Lighting Answers: Light Sources and Color. Troy, NY: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; National Lighting Product Information Program. Available online at: {{cite web |url=http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/nlpip/publicationDetails.asp?id=901&amp;type=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611200908/http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/nlpip/publicationDetails.asp?id=901&amp;type=2 |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To deal with the problem of having to compare light sources of different correlated color temperatures (CCT), the CIE settled on using a reference [[black body]] with the same color temperature for lamps with a CCT of under 5000&amp;nbsp;K, or a phase of CIE [[standard illuminant]] D (daylight) otherwise. This presented a continuous range of color temperatures to choose a reference from. Any chromaticity difference between the source and reference illuminants were to be abridged with a von Kries-type [[chromatic adaptation transform]].

==Test method==

The CRI is calculated by comparing the color rendering of the test source to that of a "perfect" source, which is a black body radiator for sources with correlated color temperatures under 5000&amp;nbsp;K, and a phase of daylight otherwise (e.g., [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]]). [[Chromatic adaptation]] should be performed so that like quantities are compared.  The ''Test Method'' (also called ''Test Sample Method'' or ''Test Color Method'') needs only [[colorimetric]], rather than [[spectrophotometric]], information.&lt;ref name="CIE1995"&gt;{{citation

# Using the [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE standard observer|2° standard observer]], find the [[chromaticity]] co-ordinates of the test source in the [[CIE 1960 color space]].&lt;ref&gt;Note that when CRI was designed in 1965, the most perceptually uniform chromaticity space was the [[CIE 1960 color space|CIE 1960 UCS]], the [[CIELUV|CIE 1976 UCS]] not yet having been invented.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Determine the [[correlated color temperature]] (CCT) of the test source by finding the closest point to the [[Planckian locus]] on the (''u'',''v'') chromaticity diagram.
# If the test source has a CCT&lt;5000&amp;nbsp;K, use a black body for reference, otherwise use CIE [[standard illuminant]] D. Both sources should have the same CCT.
# Ensure that the chromaticity distance (DC) of the test source to the Planckian locus is under 5.4×10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; in the CIE 1960 UCS. This ensures the meaningfulness of the result, as the CRI is only defined for light sources that are approximately white.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|CIE|1995}}, [http://resodance.com/ali/CRI_prob.html Section 5.3: Tolerance for reference illuminant]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;DC={\Delta}_{uv}=\sqrt{(u_r-u_t)^2+(v_r-v_t)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

# Chromatically adapt each sample by a [[Chromatic adaptation#von Kries transform|von Kries transform]].
# For each sample, calculate the [[Euclidean distance]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_i&lt;/math&gt; between the pair of co-ordinates.
# Calculate the special (i.e., particular) CRI using the formula &lt;math&gt;R_i=100-4.6 \Delta E_i&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Per {{harvtxt|Schanda|Sándor|2003}}, {{harvtxt|Schanda|2002}} and, as demonstrated in the [[#Example|Example]] section, the coefficient was chosen as 4.6 so that the CRI of the CIE [[standard illuminant]] F4, an obsolete "warm white" calcium halophosphate [[fluorescent lamp]] would be 51. Today's fluorescent "[[full-spectrum light]]s" boast CRIs approaching 100; e.g, [http://www.truesun.com/philips_TL950.php Philips TL950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012085113/http://www.truesun.com/philips_TL950.php |date=2007-10-12 }} or {{patent|EP|1184893}}. {{harvtxt|Thornton|1972}} compares older products; {{harvtxt|Guo|Houser|2004}} compares newer ones.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It appeared that &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; could be negative (&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_i&lt;/math&gt; ≥ 22), and this was indeed calculated for some lamp test colors, especially TCS9 (strong red).&lt;/ref&gt;
# Find the general CRI (R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) by calculating the [[arithmetic mean]] of the special CRIs.

Note that the last three steps are equivalent to finding the mean [[color difference]], &lt;math&gt;\Delta \bar{E}_{UVW}&lt;/math&gt; and using that to calculate &lt;math&gt;R_a&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;R_a=100-4.6 \Delta \bar{E}_{UVW}&lt;/math&gt;

===Chromatic adaptation===
[[File:CIE CRI TCS under FL4.svg|thumb|Chromatic adaptation of TCSs lit by CIE FL4 (short, black vectors, to indicate before and after) to a black body of 2940 K (cyan circles).]]

{{harvtxt|CIE|1995}} uses this von Kries chromatic transform equation to find the [[corresponding color]] (''u''&lt;sub&gt;''c'',''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''c'',''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) for each sample. The mixed subscripts (''t'',''i'') refer to the [[inner product]] of the test illuminant spectrum and the spectral reflexivity of sample ''i'':

&lt;math&gt;u_{c,i}=\frac{10.872+0.404 (c_r/c_t) c_{t,i} - 4 (d_r/d_t) d_{t,i}}{16.518+1.481 (c_r/c_t) c_{t,i} - (d_r/d_t) d_{t,i}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v_{c,i}=\frac{5.520}{16.518+1.481 (c_r/c_t) c_{t,i} - (d_r/d_t) d_{t,i}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c=\left(4.0-u-10.0v \right)/v&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;d=\left(1.708v-1.481u+0.404\right)/v&lt;/math&gt;

where subscripts ''r'' and ''t'' refer to reference and test light sources, respectively.

As specified in {{harvtxt|CIE|1995}}, the original test color samples (TCS) are taken from an early edition of the [[Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test|Munsell]] Atlas. The first eight samples, a subset of the eighteen proposed in {{harvtxt|Nickerson|1960}}, are relatively low saturated colors and are evenly distributed over the complete range of hues.&lt;ref&gt;See the CIE 1960 UCS diagram towards the end of the [[#Example|Example]] section.&lt;/ref&gt; These eight samples are employed to calculate the general color rendering index &lt;math&gt;R_a&lt;/math&gt;. The last six samples provide supplementary information about the color rendering properties of the light source; the first four for high saturation, and the last two as representatives of well-known objects. The reflectance spectra of these samples may be found in {{harvtxt|CIE|2004}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://photometry.kriss.re.kr/wiki/img_auth.php/4/47/CIE_TCS.csv TCS spectra in CSV form] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211042805/http://photometry.kriss.re.kr/wiki/img_auth.php/4/47/CIE_TCS.csv |date=2009-02-11 }}, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science.&lt;/ref&gt; and their approximate Munsell notations are listed aside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cis.rit.edu/mcsl/online/munsell.php Munsell Renotation Data], ''Munsell Color Science Laboratory'', [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the CIE's 1991 Quadrennial Meeting, Technical Committee 1-33 (Color Rendering) was assembled to work on updating the color rendering method, as a result of which the R96&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; method was developed. The committee was dissolved in 1999, releasing {{harvtxt|CIE|1999}}, but no firm recommendations, partly due to disagreements between researchers and manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;"Authors’ response to SA Fotios and
JA Lynes" in {{harvtxt|Schanda|Sándor|2005}}: ''The main message of our investigations is an answer to the lamp industry, who still use the colour rendering index and the lamp efficacy as parameters for optimizing their lamp spectra, and have turned down the work of CIE TC 1-33 by stating that there are not enough visual experiments showing the shortcomings of the CIE colour rendering calculation method.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The R96&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; method has a few distinguishing features:&lt;ref&gt;See "Past research to improve the CRI" in {{harvtxt|Bodrogi|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[#New test color samples|A new set of test color samples]]
* Six reference illuminants: D65, D50, black bodies of 4200 K, 3450 K, 2950 K, and 2700 K.
* A new chromatic adaptation transform: CIECAT94.
* Color difference evaluation in CIELAB.
* Adaptation of all colors to [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]] (since CIELAB is well-tested under D65).

It is conventional to use the original method; R96&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; should be explicitly mentioned if used.

As discussed in {{harvtxt|Schanda|Sándor|2005}}, {{harvtxt|CIE|1999}} recommends the use of a [[ColorChecker]] chart owing to the obsolescence of the original samples, of which only [[Metamerism (color)|metameric]] matches remain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xrite.com/product_overview.aspx?ID=820&amp;Action=Library X-Rite ColorChecker Chart].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the eight ColorChart samples, two skin tone samples are defined (TCS09&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and TCS10&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;). Accordingly, the updated general CRI is averaged over ten samples, not eight as before. Nevertheless, {{harvtxt|Hung|2002}} has determined that the patches in {{harvtxt|CIE|1995}} give better correlations for any color difference than the ColorChecker chart, whose samples are not equally distributed in a uniform color space.

== Example ==

The CRI can also be theoretically derived from the SPD of the illuminant and samples since physical copies of the original color samples are difficult to find. In this method, care should be taken to use a sampling resolution fine enough to capture spikes in the SPD. The SPDs of the standard test colors are tabulated in 5&amp;nbsp;nm increments {{harvtxt|CIE|2004}}, so it is suggested to use interpolation up to the resolution of the illuminant's spectrophotometry.

Starting with the SPD, let us verify that the CRI of reference illuminant F4 is 51. The first step is to determine the [[tristimulus value]]s using the 1931 standard observer. Calculation of the [[inner product]] of the SPD with the standard observer's color matching functions (CMFs) yields (''X'',''Y'',''Z'')=(109.2,100.0,38.9) (after normalizing for Y=100). From this follow the ''xy'' chromaticity values:

[[Image:CIE 1960 UCS, FL4.svg|thumb|right|200px|The tight isotherms are from 2935K–2945K. FL4 marked with a cross.]]

&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{109.2}{109.2+100.0+38.9}=0.4402&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{100}{109.2+100.0+38.9}=0.4031&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to convert these chromaticities to the [[CIE 1960 color space|CIE 1960 UCS]] in order to be able to determine the CCT:

&lt;math&gt;u=\frac{4 \times 0.4402}{-2 \times 0.4402 + 12 \times 0.4031 + 3}=0.2531&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{6 \times 0.4031}{-2 \times 0.4402 + 12 \times 0.4031 + 3}=0.3477&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:CIE illuminant F4 and a blackbody of 2938K.svg|thumb|200px|Relative SPD of FL4 and a black body of equal CCT. Not normalized.]]

Examining the CIE 1960 UCS reveals this point to be closest to 2938&amp;nbsp;K on the Planckian locus, which has a co-ordinate of (0.2528, 0.3484). The distance of the test point to the locus is under the limit (5.4×10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;), so we can continue the procedure, assured of a meaningful result:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} DC&amp;=\sqrt{ (0.2531-0.2528)^2+(0.3477-0.3484)^2 } \\
&amp; =8.12 \times 10^{-4} &lt; 5.4 \times 10^{-3} \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

We can verify the CCT by using [[Color temperature#Approximation|McCamy's approximation algorithm]] to estimate the CCT from the ''xy'' chromaticities:

&lt;math&gt;CCT_{est.} = -449 n^3 + 3525 n^2 - 6823.3 n + 5520.33&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n=\frac{x-0.3320}{y-0.1858}&lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(0.4402,0.4031)&lt;/math&gt; yields ''n''=0.4979 and CCT&lt;sub&gt;est.&lt;/sub&gt; = 2941&amp;nbsp;K, which is close enough. ([[Color temperature#Robertson's method|Robertson's method]] can be used for greater precision, but we will be content with 2940&amp;nbsp;K in order to replicate published results.) Since 2940&amp;nbsp;&lt; 5000, we select a Planckian radiator of 2940&amp;nbsp;K as the reference illuminant.

The next step is to determine the values of the test color samples under each illuminant in the [[CIE 1964 color space|CIEUVW color space]]. This is done by integrating the product of the CMF with the SPDs of the illuminant and the sample, then converting from CIEXYZ to CIEUVW (with the u,v coordinates of the reference illuminant as white point):

From this we can calculate the color difference between the chromatically adapted samples (labeled "CAT") and those illuminated by the reference. (The Euclidean metric is used to calculate the color difference in CIEUVW.) The special CRI is simply &lt;math&gt;R_i=100-4.6 \Delta E_{UVW}&lt;/math&gt;.

|}

Finally, the general color rendering index is the mean of the special CRIs: 51.

[[File:CIE CRI TCS under FL4.svg|thumb|600px|center|The cyan circles indicate the TCS under the ''reference'' illuminant. The short, black, vectors indicate the TCS under the ''test'' illuminant, before and after chromatic adaptation transformation (CAT). (The vectors are short because the white points are close.) The post-CAT end of the vector lies NW, mirroring the chromaticity vector between the reference and test illuminants.
&lt;br /&gt;
The special CRIs are reflected in the length of the dotted lines linking the chromaticities of the samples under the reference and chromatically adapted test illuminants, respectively. Short distances, as in the case of TCS3, result in a high special CRI (87.9), whereas long distances, as in the case of TCS8, result in a low special CRI (10.4). In simpler terms, TCS3 reproduces better under FL4 than does TCS8 (relative to a black body).]]

A reference source, such as blackbody radiation, is defined as having a CRI of 100. This is why [[incandescent lamp]]s have that rating, as they are, in effect, almost blackbody radiators. The best possible faithfulness to a reference is specified by a CRI of one hundred, while the very poorest is specified by a CRI below zero. A high CRI by itself does not imply a good rendition of color, because the reference itself may have an imbalanced SPD if it has an extreme color temperature.

== Criticism ==

Ohno and others have criticized CRI for not always correlating well with subjective color rendering quality in practice, particularly for light sources with spiky emission spectra such as fluorescent lamps or white [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s. Another problem is that the CRI is discontinuous at 5000&amp;nbsp;K,&lt;ref&gt;"Authors’ response to SA Fotios and JA Lynes" in {{harvtxt|Schanda|Sándor|2005}}: ''It is quite obvious that just at 5000&amp;nbsp;K, where the reference illuminant has to be changed, the present system shows discontinuity.'&lt;/ref&gt; because the chromaticity of the reference moves from the [[Planckian locus]] to the [[Standard illuminant#Illuminant series D|CIE daylight locus]]. {{harvtxt|Davis|Ohno|2006}} identify several other issues, which they address in their [[Color Quality Scale]] (CQS):

* The color space in which the color distance is calculated (CIEUVW) is obsolete and nonuniform. Use [[CIELAB]] or [[CIELUV]] instead.
* The chromatic adaptation transform used ([[Von Kries transform]]) is inadequate. Use [[CIECAM02#Chromatic adaptation|CMCCAT2000]] or [[CIECAM02|CIECAT02]] instead.
* Calculating the arithmetic mean of the errors diminishes the contribution of any single large deviation. Two light sources with similar CRI may perform significantly differently if one has a particularly low special CRI in a spectral band that is important for the application. Use the [[root mean square deviation]] instead.
* The metric is not perceptual; all errors are equally weighted, whereas humans favor certain errors over others. A color can be more saturated or less saturated without a change in the numerical value of ∆''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, while in general a saturated color is experienced as being more attractive.
* A negative CRI is difficult to interpret. Normalize the scale from 0 to 100 using the formula &lt;math&gt;R_{out}=10 \ln \left[\exp(R_{in}/10)+1\right]&lt;/math&gt;
* The CRI cannot be calculated for light sources that do not have a CCT (non-white light).
* Eight samples are not enough since manufacturers can optimize the emission spectra of their lamps to reproduce them faithfully, but otherwise perform poorly. Use more samples (they suggest fifteen for CQS).
* The samples are not saturated enough to pose difficulty for reproduction.
* CRI merely measures the faithfulness of any illuminant to an ideal source with the same CCT, but the ideal source itself may not render colors well if it has an extreme color temperature, due to a lack of energy at either short or long wavelengths (i.e., it may be excessively blue or red). Weight the result by the ratio of the [[gamut]] area of the polygon formed by the fifteen samples in CIELAB for 6500&amp;nbsp;K to the gamut area for the test source. 6500&amp;nbsp;K is chosen for reference since it has a relatively even distribution of energy over the visible spectrum and hence high gamut area. This normalizes the multiplication factor.

Rea and Freyssinier have developed another index, the Gamut Area Index (GAI), in an attempt to improve over the flaws found in the CRI.&lt;ref&gt;Rea, M.S. and Freysinnier-Nova, JP. "Color rendering: A tale of two metrics," Color Research and Application, 33(3), 192-202 (2008). {{doi|10.1002/col.20399}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have shown that the GAI is better than the CRI at predicting color discrimination on standardized Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Tests and that GAI is predictive of color saturation.&lt;ref name="Color rendering: Beyond pride and prejudice - Rea - 2010 - Color Research &amp;amp; Application - Wiley Online Library" /&gt; Proponents of using GAI claim that, when used in conjunction with CRI, this method of evaluating color rendering is preferred by test subjects over light sources that have high values of only one measure. Researchers recommend a lower and an upper limit to GAI. Use of LED technology has called for a new way to evaluate color rendering because of the unique spectrum of light created by these technologies. Preliminary tests have shown that the combination of GAI and CRI used together is a preferred method for evaluating color rendering.&lt;ref&gt;Alliance for Solid-State Illumination Systems and Technologies.

{{harvtxt|Pousset|Obein|Razet|2010}} developed a psychophysical experiment in order to evaluate light quality of LED lightings. It is based on colored samples used in the "Color Quality Scale". Predictions of the CQS and results from visual measurements were compared.

{{harvtxt|CIE|2007}} "reviews the applicability of the CIE color rendering index to white LED light sources based on the results of visual experiments." Chaired by Davis, CIE TC 1-69(C) is currently investigating "new methods for assessing the color rendition properties of white-light sources used for illumination, including solid-state light sources, with the goal of recommending new assessment procedures [...] by March, 2010."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cie.co.at/div1/ActReps/D1ActivityReport08.pdf CIE Activity Report. Division 1: Vision and Color], pg.21, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a comprehensive review of alternative color rendering indexes see {{harvtxt|Guo|Houser|2004}}.

{{harvtxt|Smet|2011}} reviewed several alternative quality metrics and compared their performance based on visual data obtained in nine psychophysical experiments. It was found that a geometric mean of the GAI index and the CIE Ra correlated best with naturalness (r=0.85), while a color quality metric based on memory colors (MCRI&lt;ref&gt;Smet KAG, Ryckaert WR, Pointer MR, Deconinck G, Hanselaer P. Colour Appearance Rating of Familiar Real Objects. Colour Research and Application 2011;36(3):192–200.&lt;/ref&gt;) correlated best for preference (r=0.88). The differences in performance of these metrics with the other tested metrics (CIE Ra; CRI-CAM02UCS; CQS; RCRI; GAI; geomean (GAI, CIE Ra); CSA; Judd Flattery; Thornton CPI; MCRI) were found to be statistically significant with p&lt;0.0001.&lt;ref&gt;Smet KAG, Ryckaert WR, Pointer MR, Deconinck G, Hanselaer P.

== Film and video high-CRI LED lighting incompatibility ==

Problems have been encountered attempting to use LED lighting on film and video sets. The color spectra of LED lighting primary colors does not match the expected color wavelength bandpasses of film emulsions and digital sensors. As a result, color rendition can be completely unpredictable in optical prints, transfers to digital media from film (DI's), and video camera recordings. This phenomenon with respect to motion picture film has been documented in an LED lighting evaluation series of tests produced by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] scientific staff.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 | url = http://www.oscars.org/science-technology/sci-tech-projects/solid-state-lighting-report
 | title = Solid State Lighting Report
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To that end, various other metrics such as the TLCI (television lighting consistency index) have been developed to replace the human observer with a camera observer.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 | url = https://tech.ebu.ch/tlci-2012
 | title = EBU Technology &amp; Innovation - Television Lighting Consistency Index 2012
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to the CRI, the metric measures quality of a light source as it would appear on camera on a scale from 0 to 100.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

==Origins==
Von Hausswolff and Elggren formed the name out of their own names and define the country as being the [[border]]s of other countries. The decision to found the country and name themselves kings was in reaction to Sweden still having a monarchy.&lt;ref name=venice&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/09/arts/design/09bien.html|title=At Venice Biennale, Artists Plant Flag for Their State (of Mind)|work=New York Times|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=June 9, 2007|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country was announced in an advert in ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' newspaper.

Elgaland-Vargaland has a flag&lt;ref name=nowandthen/&gt; and national anthem, issues passports and stamps on request, and has had a number of "embassies" (art exhibitions).&lt;ref name=venice/&gt; Elggren often invokes "the image of a street-corner lunatic with a paper crown who declares himself King".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lN85AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=elgaland&amp;dq=elgaland|title=Micro-bionic: Radical Electronic Music and Sound Art in the 21st Century|first1=Thomas|last1=Bey|first2=William|last2=Bailey|publisher=Creation Books|date=2009|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claims extend to other "interstitial territories" such as the transition from being asleep to wakefulness (the hypnogogic state),&lt;ref name=mass/&gt; and [[limbo]]&lt;ref name=exist/&gt; and they also regard all dead people as being citizens.

==Reception==
KREV has been described as an art project that criticises the principles of the nation state and von Hausswolff and Elggren has, with the projects hierarchical diagram, clearly stated their disgust towards any kind of racism, fascism and oligarchy.

[[File:Francis Burnand.png|thumb|right|250px|From ''The History of [[Punch (magazine)|"Punch"]]'']]
'''Sir Francis Cowley Burnand''' (29 November 1836 &amp;ndash; 21 April 1917), usually known as '''F. C. Burnand''', was an English comic writer and prolific playwright, best known today as the librettist of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s opera ''[[Cox and Box]]''.

The son of a prosperous family, he was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and was expected to follow a conventional career in the law or in the church, but he concluded that his vocation was the theatre. From his schooldays he had written comic plays, and from 1860 until the end of the 19th century, he produced a series of more than 200 [[Victorian burlesque]]s, [[farces]], [[pantomime]]s and other stage works. His early successes included the burlesques ''Ixion, or the Man at the Wheel'' (1863) and ''The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up'' (1866).  Also in 1866, he adapted the popular farce ''[[Box and Cox (farce)|Box and Cox]]'' as a comic opera, ''Cox and Box'', with music by Sullivan. The piece became a popular favourite and was later frequently used by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] as a curtain raiser; it remains regularly performed today.

By the 1870s, Burnand was generating a prodigious output of plays as well as comic pieces and illustrations for the humour magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. Among his 55-stage works during the decade was another frequently revived hit, ''Betsy'' (1879). For ''Punch'', among other things, he wrote the popular column "Happy Thoughts", in which the narrator recorded the difficulties and distractions of everyday life. Also admired were his burlesques of other writers' works. Burnand was a contributor to ''Punch'' for 45 years and its editor from 1880 until 1906 and is credited with adding much to the popularity and prosperity of the magazine. His editorship of the original publication of ''[[The Diary of a Nobody]]'' by the brothers [[George Grossmith|George]] and [[Weedon Grossmith]] was a high point of his tenure in 1888–89. Many of his articles were collected and published in book form. His stage successes in the 1890s included his English-language versions of two [[Edmond Audran]] operettas, titled ''La Cigale'' and ''Miss Decima'' (both in 1891). His last works included collaborations on pantomimes of ''[[Cinderella]]'' (1905) and ''Aladdin'' (1909).

Known generally for his genial wit and good humor, Burnand was nevertheless intensely envious of his contemporary [[W. S. Gilbert]] but was unable to emulate his rival's success as a comic opera librettist. In other forms of theatre Burnand was outstandingly successful, with his works receiving London runs of up to 550 performances and extensive tours in the British provinces and the US.  He published several humorous books and memoirs and was knighted in 1902 for his work on ''Punch''.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Burnand was born in central London, the only child of Francis Burnand and his first wife Emma, ''née'' Cowley, who died when her son was eight days old.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32183 "Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley (1836–1917)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 8 June 2014, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32183}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnand senior, a stockbroker, was descended from an old [[Savoy]]ard family, prominent in the silk trade; his wife was a descendant of the poet and dramatist [[Hannah Cowley]].&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

Burnand was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], where, aged fifteen, he wrote a [[farce]], ''Guy Fawkes Day'', played at [[William Cookesley|Cookesley]]'s house, and subsequently at the Theatre Royal, [[Worthing]].&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U194179 "Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley"], ''Who Was Who'', online edition, Oxford University Press, 2014, accessed 7 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; While at Eton, he submitted some illustrations to the comic weekly magazine, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', one or two of which were published. In 1854 he went to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where as an undergraduate he sought the approval of the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Vice-Chancellor]], [[Edwin Guest]], of the establishment of a [[Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club]], with a performance of ''[[Box and Cox (farce)|Box and Cox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Burnand, pp. 7–17&lt;/ref&gt; Guest and his colleagues refused their consent, but Burnand went ahead without it. The members of the club performed a triple bill under stage names to avoid retribution from the university. The club prospered (and continues to the present day); Burnand acted and wrote plays under the name Tom Pierce.&lt;ref&gt;Burnand, pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnand graduated in 1858. His family had expected that he would study for the [[Barrister|bar]], but the Burnands held the right to appoint the [[vicar|incumbent]] of a [[Church of England]] parish that became vacant, and it was agreed that he should train for the priesthood.&lt;ref name=aam&gt;Milne, A.

===1860s: start of writing career===
[[File:F C Burnand Charicatures Shakespeare.png|right|thumb|upright|Burnand as Mr Punch, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'''s mascot]]
In February 1860 Burnand had his first piece performed in the [[West End theatre|West End]], ''Dido the Celebrated Widow'', a [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]] of ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'', played at the [[St James's Theatre]].&lt;ref name=nicoll288&gt;Nicoll, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; The following month he married an actress, Cecilia Victoria Ranoe (1841–1870), daughter of James Ranoe, a clerk; the couple had five sons and two daughters. He was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1862, and practised for a short time, but his main interest was in writing. In the early 1860s, he edited the short-lived journal ''The Glow-Worm'' and then joined the staff of ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'', edited by [[Henry James Byron|H. J. Byron]]. He parted company with Byron when the magazine rejected his proposed 1863 [[burlesque (literary)|literary burlesque]] of a [[George W. M. Reynolds|Reynolds]] serial, entitled ''Mokeanna, or the White Witness''. He showed his manuscript to [[Mark Lemon]], editor of ''Punch'', who accepted it for publication; Burnand remained a ''Punch'' writer for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;{{refn|[[W. S. Gilbert]], later Burnand's rival as a comic playwright, made the opposite journey, severing his connection with ''Punch'' in favour of ''Fun'' when Lemon turned down one of Gilbert's ''[[Bab Ballads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Two Great English Humorists – Gilbert and Burnand", ''The Times'', 18 November 1936, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

''Dido'' was followed by ''The Îles of St Tropez'' (1860), ''Fair Rosamond'' (1862) and ''The Deal Boatman'' (1863), among many others.&lt;ref name=Parker84&gt;Parker, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; His most memorable early success was another musical burlesque, ''[[Ixion]], or the Man at the Wheel'' (1863), starring [[Lydia Thompson]] in the title role, which found audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. By this time Burnand was a skilled negotiator with theatre managements, and he was among the first authors to insist on profit-sharing instead of fixed royalties. For ''Ixion'' this brought him a total of around £3,000.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early works included an [[opéra bouffe]], ''Windsor Castle'' (1865), with music by Frank Musgrave, and more pun-filled burlesques, including ''[[Helen of Troy|Helen]], or, Taken from the Greek'', and ''[[Guy Fawkes]], or The Ugly Mug and the Couple of Spoons'', both in 1866.&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; Later in 1866 Burnand had a huge success with the burlesque ''The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up'', parodying the three-act melodrama by [[Douglas Jerrold]], ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'';&lt;ref name=Susan&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ts5ZAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA51 "''The Morning Post''"], ''Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up'', review in ''The Morning Post'', digitized by The British Library (2013), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; the show ran for 400 nights at the [[Royalty Theatre]], was played for years provincially and in the US, and was twice revived in London.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt;

[[File:Black eyed See-Usan - Weir Collection.jpg|upright|thumb|Theatre poster for Burnard's ''Black Eyed See-Usan'']]
In 1866, Burnand adapted the popular farce ''Box and Cox'' as a [[comic opera]], ''[[Cox and Box]]'', with music by the young composer [[Arthur Sullivan]]. The piece was written for a private performance but was repeated and given its first public performance at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew. "Cox and Box" &amp;ndash; A Postscript", ''The Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Journal'', 1968, volume IX, 7, pp.132–133; and "Adelphi Theatre", ''The Times'', 13 May 1867, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer for ''Fun'' was [[W. S. Gilbert]], who wrote
{{quote|Mr Sullivan's music is, in many places, of too high a class for the grotesquely absurd plot to which it is wedded. It is very funny, here and there, and grand or graceful when it is not funny; but the grand and the graceful have, we think, too large a share of the honours to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;|}}
''Cox and Box'' became a popular favourite and was frequently revived.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Royal Gallery of Illustration]]", ''The Times'', 30 March 1869, p. 10 "The Theatres", ''The Times'', 15 July 1880, p. 6; "Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 11 March 1895, p. 12; and "The Theatres", ''The Times'', 25 August 1921, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only work not by Gilbert in the regular repertory of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] during the 20th century and is the only work of Burnand's still frequently staged.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 15, 140–186 and xxv–xxvi; and [http://www.gloc.org/#/cox-and-box/4584711461 "Cox and Box on tour"], [[Grosvenor Light Opera Company]], accessed 8 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Fredric Woodbridge Wilson.

"Burnand, Sir Francis Cowley"], Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 8 July 2014 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success encouraged its authors to write the two-act opera, ''[[The Contrabandista]]'' (1867), revised and expanded as ''[[The Chieftain]]'' (1894), but it did not achieve much popularity in either version.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 62; and Rollins and Witts, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

More burlesques followed in 1868, including ''Fowl Play, or, A Story of Chicken Hazard'' and ''The Rise and Fall of Richard III, or, A New Front to an Old Dicky''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1869, Burnand wrote ''The Turn of the Tide'', which was a success at the [[Queen's Theatre]], and six other stage works during the course of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Nicoll, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

===1870s: prolific author===
[[File:Goodoldgaietyhis00holluoft 61.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Burnand, c. 1870s]]
Burnand's wife Cecilia died in 1870 at age 28, leaving him with seven small children. In 1874 Burnand married her widowed sister, Rosina (d. 1924), who was also an actress.&lt;ref name=Susan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp89208/rosina-nee-ranoe-lady-burnand "Rosina (née Ranoe), Lady Burnand"], National Portrait Gallery, accessed 9 July 2014. She had appeared in, among other things, Burnand's ''Black-Eyed Susan'' and Gilbert's ''[[An Old Score]]'', and had performed together with her sister and Burnand in Burnand's one-act burlesque of ''[[The Odyssey]]'', [http://www.mocavo.com/Sir-Charles-Wyndham-a-Biography-2/116574/59#62 ''Patient Penelope; or, The Return of Ulysses''].&lt;/ref&gt; It was at that time illegal in England for a man to marry his dead wife's sister,{{refn|This became legal in 1907 under the [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907]].|group=n}} although such marriages made outside British jurisdiction were recognised as valid; accordingly the wedding ceremony was performed in continental Europe. There were two sons and four daughters of this marriage.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Throughout the 1870s, Burnand maintained a prodigious output. For the stage he wrote 55 pieces, ranging from burlesques to [[pantomime]]s, farces and [[extravaganza]]s.&lt;ref name=nicoll289&gt;Nicoll, pp. 289–291&lt;/ref&gt; He was the sole author of most of them, but worked on a few with [[Thomas German Reed]], [[James Lynam Molloy|J. L. Molloy]], [[Henry Pottinger Stephens]] and even with H. J. Byron.&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; His stage pieces of the 1870s included ''Poll and Partner Joe'' (1871),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Penelope Anne'' (1871; a sequel to ''Cox and Box''),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''The Miller and His Man'' (1873; "a Christmas drawing room extravaganza" with songs by Sullivan),&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, Paul. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/sullivan/miller/index.html ''The Miller and His Man''], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 2 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ''Artful Cards'' (1877),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Proof'' (1878),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Dora and Diplunacy'' (1878, a burlesque of [[Clement Scott]]'s ''Diplomacy'', an adaptation of [[Victorien Sardou|Sardou]]'s ''Dora''),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''[[The Forty Thieves]]'' (1878; a charity collaboration among four playwrights, including Byron and Gilbert),&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; ''Our Club'' (1878)&lt;ref name=nicoll289/&gt; and another frequently revived hit, ''Betsy'' (1879).&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt; He provided a burlesque of ''Robbing Roy'' to the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''The Times'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Burnand's prolific writing came at some cost in quality. A biographer wrote that he "was a facile and slapdash writer. False rhymes and awkward rhythms occur frequently in his verse, and his favourite devices included puns, topical references and slang."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Burnand also translated or adapted for the London stage several French operettas by [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]], [[Edmond Audran]], [[Charles Lecocq]] and [[Robert Planquette]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; At the same time as his busy theatrical career, he was a member of the staff of ''Punch'' under Lemon and his successors, [[Shirley Brooks]] and [[Tom Taylor]], writing a regular stream of genial articles.&lt;ref name=aam/&gt; His best-known work for the magazine was the column "Happy Thoughts", in which the narrator recorded the difficulties and distractions of everyday life. [[A. A. Milne]] considered it "one of the most popular series which has ever appeared in ''Punch''"; alongside it, he rated as Burnand's best comic contributions his burlesques of other writers, such as "The New History of Sandford and Merton" (1872) and "Strapmore" by "Weeder" (1878).&lt;ref name=aam/&gt;{{refn|These parodied ''[[The History of Sandford and Merton]]'' by [[Thomas Day]], a moralising work for children; and ''Strathmore'', a novel by [[Ouida]], in his burlesque of which Burnand parodied two genres: novels of high society and Italian peasant stories.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors whom he satirised included [[Victor Hugo]], presented in ''Punch'' as "Fictor Nogo".&lt;ref&gt;Spielmann, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

===1880s: editor of ''Punch''===
[[File:J L Toole as Paw Claudian.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J. L. Toole]] in Burnand's ''Paw Claudian'', 1884]]
The third editor of ''Punch'', Tom Taylor, died in July 1880; the proprietors of the magazine appointed Burnand to succeed him. In Milne's view the magazine's reputation increased considerably under Burnand:
{{quote|It grew less intolerant of opinions with which it disagreed; it became more catholic in its appeal; it began to discard its air of a Family Joke and aspired to be the National Institution which it has since been proclaimed. Yet he always kept for it a note of irresponsibility.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;|}}
A later biographer, Jane Stedman, writes, "His predecessor, Tom Taylor, had allowed the paper to become heavy, but Burnand's rackety leadership brightened it."  Burnand, who declared himself "hostile to no man's religion", banned ''Punch'''s previous anti-Catholicism, although he was unable to prevent some antisemitic jokes.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

One of Burnand's biggest successes, both in ''Punch'' and on stage, was satire of the [[aesthetic movement]]. His play ''[[The Colonel (play)|The Colonel]]'' (1881), based on ''The Serious Family'', a play by Morris Barnett, ran for 550 performances and toured extensively. It made so much money for the actor-manager Edgar Bruce that he was able to build the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. Burnand rushed ''The Colonel'' into production to make sure that it opened several months before [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s similarly themed comic opera, ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Burnand, 2nd Edition, vol. 2, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Patience'' ran even longer than ''The Colonel''.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Wilde]], no fan of Burnand's farces, wrote, in anticipation of seeing ''Patience'': "With Gilbert and Sullivan I am sure we will have something better than the dull farce of ''The Colonel''".&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, p. 109, letter to [[George Grossmith]], April 1881&lt;/ref&gt; For the Gaiety Theatre, Burnand wrote a burlesque of ''[[The Tempest]]'' entitled ''Ariel'' in October 1883, with music by [[Meyer Lutz]], starring [[Nellie Farren]] and [[Arthur Williams (actor)|Arthur Williams]]. ''[[The Times]]'' complained of the "flatness and insipidity" of Burnand's text and of his vulgarising the original.&lt;ref&gt;"Gaiety Theatre", ''The Times'', 9 October 1883, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' was less censorious, finding the piece moderately amusing, and correctly predicting that it would run successfully until it had to make way for the annual Gaiety pantomime at Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;"At the Play", ''The Observer'', 14 October 1883, p. 7; and "Theatres", ''The Times', 8 December 1883, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, Burnand wrote ''Paw Claudian'', a burlesque of the 1883 costume (Byzantine) drama ''Claudian'' by Henry Herman and W. G. Wills, presented at [[Toole's Theatre]] starring [[J. L. Toole]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; The same year, he wrote a burlesque of ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'', called ''Black Eyed See-Usan'', for the [[Alhambra Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5OE4AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA220 "Dramatic Gossip"], ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]: A Journal'', 16 August 1884, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Burnand wrote several musical works around 1889 and 1890 with the composer [[Edward Solomon]], including ''Pickwick'', which was revived in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Simon. [http://www.c20th.com/GSarchiveother.htm Programme and description of 1894 production], Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, a selling exhibition of memorabilia, Archive: Other items, accessed 9 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pickwick'' was recorded by Retrospect Opera in 2016, together with [[George Grossmith]]'s ''[[Cups and Saucers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, David. [http://www.retrospectopera.org.uk/CD_catalogue.html "''Pickwick'' by Burnand &amp; Solomon and ''Cups and Saucers'' by George Grossmith"],  Retrospect Opera, 2016, accessed 13 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Other stage pieces included adaptations for [[Augustine Daly]] in New York.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:Chieftain poster 1894.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Poster for the original production of ''[[The Chieftain]]'', 1894]]
In 1890, Burnand wrote ''Captain Therèse,'' followed later that year by a very successful English version of Audran's operetta, ''La cigale et la fourmi'' (the grasshopper and the ant) retitled ''La Cigale'', with additional music by [[Ivan Caryll]].&lt;ref&gt;"Lyric Theatre", ''The Times'', 10 October 1890, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, he produced an English adaptation of Audran's ''Miss Helyett'', retitled as ''Miss Decima''. Burnand's ''The Saucy Sally'' premiered in 1892, and ''Mrs Ponderbury's Past'' played in 1895. Burnand's 1897 comic opera, ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'', with music by [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], failed despite the contributions of the lyricist [[Adrian Ross]] and a [[Savoy Theatre]] cast including [[Ilka Pálmay]], [[George Grossmith]] and [[Walter Passmore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_savoy/his_majesty/his_majesty_home.html "''His Majesty''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901175437/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_savoy/his_majesty/his_majesty_home.html |date=1 September 2006 }}, Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 9 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The blame was generally held to be Burnand's. ''[[The Times]]'' commented, "Mr Burnand's experience as a librettist of comic opera, and Sir Alexander Mackenzie's inexperience in this class of composition might lead the public to expect a brilliant book weighed down by music of too serious and ambitious a type. The exact opposite is the case." Burnand's libretto was judged dull and confused, but Mackenzie's music was "marked by distinction as well as humour."&lt;ref&gt;"Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 22 February 1897, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Stedman comments that Burnand's conviction that he, not Gilbert, should have been Sullivan's main collaborator defied the facts: ''The Chieftain'', his rewrite of ''The Contrabandista'' with Sullivan, ran for only 97 performances in 1894, and ''His Majesty'' managed only 61 performances.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Burnand used his position as editor of ''Punch'' to print antagonistic reviews of the plays of Gilbert and refused to give the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas reviews in the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, Harry. ''The Two Pins Club'' (1925), excerpted in ''The Gilbert Society Journal'', pp. 315–316, vol. 1, no. 10, Spring 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnand's last stage works were a collaboration with J. Hickory Wood, at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1905, on a pantomime of ''[[Cinderella]]'', and he was partly responsible for a pantomime of ''Aladdin'' for the same theatre in 1909.&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt; His later contributions to ''Punch'' became increasingly wordy and anecdotal, relying on far-fetched puns, but he was a good judge of talent, and under him the paper prospered.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; Stedman rates as a high point of his editorship the publication of ''[[The Diary of a Nobody]]'' by the brothers George and [[Weedon Grossmith]], which was soon turned into book form and has never been out of print.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He was reluctant to retire, but was persuaded to do so in 1906, and was succeeded by [[Owen Seaman]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1908, Burnand became the editor of ''The Catholic Who's Who'', published by [[Burns &amp; Oates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecatholicuniverse.com/pdf/burnand.pdf ""Burns &amp; Oates"], ''The Universe'', January 8, 1909, accessed July 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnand lived for much of his life in [[Ramsgate]], Kent, on the south coast of England and was a member of the [[Garrick Club]] in London.&lt;ref name=Parker84/&gt; He had a very large circle of friends and colleagues who included [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], Mark Lemon and most writers, dramatists and actors of the day.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; George Grossmith wrote:
{{quote|I think Frank Burnand is the most amusing man to meet. He is brimful of good humour. He will fire off joke after joke, and chaff you out of your life if he gets a chance. His chaff is always good-tempered. No one minds being chaffed by Burnand. I will not sing a song when he is in the room if I can possibly help it. He will sit in front of me at the piano, and either stare with a pained and puzzled look during my comic song, or he will laugh in the wrong places, or, what is worse still, take out his pocket-handkerchief and weep."&lt;ref&gt;Grossmith, Ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

After a winter of bronchitis, Burnand died in 1917 at his home in Ramsgate, at the age of 80. He was buried in the cemetery at St Augustine's Abbey church in Ramsgate.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Books===
Burnand's best-known book, ''Happy Thoughts'', was originally published in ''Punch'' in 1863&amp;ndash;64 and frequently reprinted. This was followed by ''My Time and What I've Done with It'' (1874); ''Personal Reminiscences of the A.D.C., Cambridge,'' (1880); ''The Incomplete Angler'' (1887); ''Very Much Abroad'' (1890); ''Rather at Sea'' (1890); ''Quite at Home'' (1890); ''The Real Adventures of Robinson Crusoe'' (1893); and ''Records and Reminiscences,'' in 1904.

It can be characterised by subject matter – which portrays non-realistic, mystical, [[mythical]] or [[folklore|folkloric]] subjects or events – and style, which is representational and naturalistic, rather than abstract - or in the case of magazine illustrations and similar, in the style of [[graphic novel]] art such as [[manga]].

Fantasy has been an integral part of art since its beginnings,&lt;ref name="Schurian"/&gt; but has been particularly important in [[mannerism]], [[magic realism|magic realist]] painting, [[romantic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], [[surrealism]] and [[lowbrow (art movement)|lowbrow]]. In French, the genre is called le [[fantastique]], in English it is sometimes referred to as ''visionary art'', ''grotesque art'' or [[mannerism|mannerist art]]. It has had a deep and circular interaction with [[fantasy literature]].

The subject matter of Fantastic Art may resemble the product of hallucinations, and Fantastic artist [[Richard Dadd]] spent much of his life in mental institutions.  [[Salvador Dalí]] famously said: "the only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=thinkexist.com |url=http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the_only_difference_between_me_and_a_madman_is/175604.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130804105007/http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the_only_difference_between_me_and_a_madman_is/175604.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 August 2013 |accessdate=4 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some recent Fantastic Art draws on the artist's experience, or purported experience, of [[hallucinogenic drugs]].

The term '''Fantasy Art''' is closely related, and is applied primarily to recent art (typically 20th century onwards) inspired by, or illustrating, fantasy literature.  The term has acquired some pejorative overtones.

Fantastic art has traditionally been largely confined to painting and illustration, but since the 1970s has increasingly been found also in photography. Fantastic art explores fantasy, imagination, the dream state, the [[grotesque]], visions and the uncanny,&lt;ref name="Schurian"&gt;Schurian, Walter (2005) Beyond Mere Understanding. In: ''Fantastic Art'', Schurian, W. &amp; Grosenick, U. (Ed.), [[Taschen]], p.6-25. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-2954-7}} (English edition)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as so-called "[[Goth]]" art.

Genres which may also be considered as Fantastic Art include the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] of the [[Victorian era]], and [[Surrealism]].  Works based on classical mythology, which have been a staple of European art from the [[Renaissance]] period, also arguably meet the definition of Fantastic Art, as art based on modern mythology such as [[JRR Tolkien]]'s [[Middle Earth]] mythos unquestionably does.  [[Religious art]] also depicts supernatural or miraculous subjects in a naturalistic way, but is not generally regarded as Fantastic Art.

== Historic artists and fine artists ==
Many artists have produced works which fit the definition of fantastic art.  Some, such as [[Nicholas Roerich]], worked almost exclusively in the genre, others such as [[Hieronymus Bosch]], who has been described as the first "fantastic" artist in the Western tradition,&lt;ref name="Schurian"/&gt;  produced works both with and without fantastic elements, and for artists such as [[Francisco de Goya]], fantastic works were only a small part of their output.  Others again such as [[René Magritte]] are usually classed as Surrealists but use fantastic elements in their work. It is therefore impossible to give an exhaustive list of fantastic artists, but a selection of major and influential figures is listed below.&lt;ref name=jahsonic&gt;{{cite web|title=Jahsonic, a vocabulary of culture|url=http://www.jahsonic.com/FantasticArt.html|accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=David (ed.)|title=Fantastic Art|year=1973|publisher=Pan Ballantine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century==
The rise of [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] "pulp" magazines demanded artwork to illustrate stories and (via cover art) to promote sales.  This led to a movement of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] artists prior to and during the Great Depression, as anthologised by [[Vincent Di Fate]], himself a prolific SF and [[space]] artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Fato|first=Vincent|title=Infinite Worlds: The Fantastic Visions of Science Fiction Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in the 1930s, a group of Wisconsin artists inspired by the Surrealist movement of Europe created their own brand of fantastic art. They included [[Madison, Wisconsin]]-based artists Marshall Glasier, Dudley Huppler and [[John Wilde]]; Karl Priebe of [[Milwaukee]] and [[Gertrude Abercrombie]] of [[Chicago]]. Their art combined macabre humor, mystery and irony &lt;ref&gt;Sara Krajewski, “Surreal Wisconsin: Surrealism and its Legacy of Wisconsin Art,” Madison Art Center, 1998  http://members.aol.com/MenuBar/surreal/surreal.htm accessed 3/26/2003&lt;/ref&gt; which was in direct and pointed contradiction to the [[American Regionalism]] then in vogue.

In postwar [[Chicago]], the art movement [[Chicago Imagism]] produced many fantastic and grotesque paintings, which were little noted because they did not conform to New York [[abstract art]] fashions of the time.  Major imagists include [[Roger Brown (artist)|Roger Brown]], [[Gladys Nilsson]], [[Jim Nutt]], [[Ed Paschke]], and [[Karl Wirsum]].&lt;ref name=Vine&gt;Richard Vine, "Where the Wild Things Were", ''[[Art in America]]'', May 1997, pp. 98-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-European Art==
Non-European art may contain fantastic elements, although it is not necessarily easy to separate them from religious elements involving supernatural beings and miraculous events.

The '''flag of British Columbia''' is based upon the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] of the [[Coat of Arms of British Columbia|provincial arms of British Columbia]]. At the top of the flag is a rendition of the [[Union Jack|Royal Union Flag]], [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] in the centre by a crown, and with a [[sunset|setting sun]] below, representing the location of the province of [[British Columbia]] at the western end of Canada.

==History==
From 1870 to 1906, British Columbia was occasionally represented by a modified British [[blue ensign]] featuring various forms of the great seal of the [[Colony of British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://contentdm.library.uvic.ca/cdm/compoundobject/collection/veh/id/1573/|title=Victoria illustrated|author=Victoria Daily Colonist}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The current flag of British Columbia was based upon the 1906 arms of the province, designed by [[Anglican]] priest Canon Arthur John Beanlands of Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1355083/British-Columbia-flag-of/|title=British Columbia, flag of|author=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the arms featured the Union Flag on the bottom. This was changed as it conflicted with the expression "[[The empire on which the sun never sets|The sun never sets on the British Empire]]." Based upon Beanlands' revised design, the flag of British Columbia was introduced on June 14, 1960, by Premier [[W. A. C. Bennett]], and was first flown on board the [[BC Ferries]] motor vessel ''Sidney'' (later ''[[MV Queen of Sidney|Queen of Sidney]]'').

==Design==
The four wavy white and three wavy blue lines symbolise the province's location between the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The setting sun represents the fact that British Columbia is Canada's westernmost province. The sun may also reflect the provincial motto "Splendor sine occasu" (beauty without diminish)—or, in other words, the sun that never sets (on the British Empire). In Canada, it could be argued, the Empire lives on in the country's symbols and parliamentary institutions. The [[Union Flag]] on top reflects the province's British heritage, while the crown in the centre represents British Columbia  becoming a Crown colony and achieving responsible government. [[Royal family of Canada|Canadian Royal Family]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The flag has an aspect ratio of 3:5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.bc.ca/bcfacts/|title=B.C. Facts|accessdate=January 30, 2008|work=Province of British Columbia|author=Government of British Columbia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707193800/http://www.gov.bc.ca/bcfacts/|archivedate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A stylised version of the flag that appears on [[Vehicle registration plates of British Columbia|British Columbia licence plates]] incorrectly features the setting sun overlapping the Union Flag instead of the waves.

The flag of British Columbia is similar to the [[flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory]]. It also bears similarities to the arms of [[Suffolk County Council]], the local authority of the county of [[Suffolk]] in the United Kingdom.

Purple Moon's games did not perform well commercially, and the company was bought by [[Mattel]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 28 May 2012" /&gt;

The '''Glenmasan manuscript''' is a 15th-century Scottish vellum manuscript in the [[National Library of Scotland]], Edinburgh, where it is catalogued as [[Advocates Library|Adv.]] MS 72.2.3. It was previously held in the [[Advocates Library]], Edinburgh, where it was classified as MS 53. The compilation contains [[Scottish Gaelic]] literary texts dealing with matter of the [[Ulster Cycle]], such as the ''[[Táin Bó Flidhais]]'' and ''Oided mac nUisnig'' (the latter a version of ''[[Longes mac n-Uislenn]]'').

==Date and provenance==

The manuscript takes its name from an entry on the front leaf, which appears to state that the original compilation was completed at [[Glen Massan|Glenmasan]] (Glen Masáin, on the [[Cowal]] peninsula in the parish of [[Dunoon]], Argyll) in the year 1238. Based on the alternation of the spelling ''ao'' and ''ai'' for the same diphthong, [[Donald MacKinnon (Scottish Celtic scholar)|Donald MacKinnon]] assigns a date no later than the end of the 15th century and suggests that the manuscript may well have been a first-hand copy of this early 13th-century exemplar. The presence of older linguistic features in the texts points to even earlier strata of writing. MacKinnon therefore proposes the scenario that an early Irish manuscript may have reached Argyll before ''c''. 1238, that about this time, a reworked version was produced, and that the surviving manuscript represents a transcript of the latter made sometime before 1500. A late, anonymous hand on folio 19 wrote ''Leabhar Echdra ata ann so ar a scriobha le Eoin M'Tavis'', "This is a book of adventures written by John M'Tavish", a name which recurs a few times elsewhere in the manuscript and fits the Argyll provenance of the text. He may have been the principal scribe, although there is no way of verifying this claim.

==History==

The earliest history of the manuscript is unknown, although later evidence suggests that it may never have circulated outside of Argyll. Marginal notes rather than external documentation shed some light on its earliest known stages. At the bottom of folio 9 occurs the name of one 'Robert Campbell at [[Glensluan]]' (Argyll), who has been identified as a forester in [[Cowal]] (Argyll) and a poet, who composed an ode to congratulate [[Edward Lhuyd]] on his ''[[Archæologia Britannica]]'' (1707, printed there). William Campbell, Robert's probable great-nephew and minister of [[Kilchrenan]] (since 1745) and [[Dalavich]], is named on folio 15 as having been the one-time owner of the book and so may have acquired it through his grand-uncle. Another explicitly named owner (before 1782) is James McIntyre of [[Glenoe]].

The manuscript appeared in a brighter light in the late 18th century, when the Committee of the [[Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland]] requested proof that the ''[[Ossian]]'' published by [[James Macpherson]] was a translation from genuinely ancient [[Scottish Gaelic]] poetry.&lt;ref name="ftn0"&gt;MacKinnon, "The Glenmasan manuscript." p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Rev. John MacKinnon of [[Glendaruel]] claimed to have received the manuscript from local countrymen, who told him that it was originally kept in the Kilbride Collection. The lawyer [[William Bannatyne, Lord Bannatyne|Lord Bannatyne]] acquired the MS from him and passed it on to the Highland Society. MacKinnon suggests that were it not for the controversy over MacPherson, the manuscript might never have come to light.

A transcript was first made by [[Ewen MacLachlan]] (1773–1822) in his ''Leabhar Caol ''("Narrow Book"). His work was superseded by Donald MacKinnon, who published a diplomatic edition with facing translation in the first four volumes of ''The Celtic Review'' (1904–1908).

==Features==

The manuscript contains 27 leaves in large [[Quarto (text)|quarto]] format, including the two forming the cover. The pages are written in double columns of 38, sometimes 39 lines each. The binding is anomalous at the beginning: the folio which now comes 3rd should have been the 5th, while a gap exists between the 4th and 5th leaf, possibly between the 5th and 3rd and possibly also between the 3rd and 6th folios.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, "Glenmasan." p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Group action on equilateral triangle.svg|right|thumb|Given an [[equilateral triangle]], the counterclockwise [[rotation]] by 120° around the center of the triangle maps every vertex of the triangle to another one. The [[cyclic group]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; consisting of the rotations by 0°, 120° and 240° acts on the set of the three vertices.]]

In [[mathematics]], an '''action''' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a formal way of interpreting the manner in which the elements of the group correspond to transformations of some [[Space (mathematics)|space]] in a way that preserves the [[mathematical structure|structure]] of that space. Common examples of spaces that groups act on are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[vector spaces]], and [[topological spaces]]. Actions of groups on vector spaces are called [[Group representation|representations]] of the group.

When there is a natural correspondence between the set of group elements and the set of space transformations, a group can be interpreted as acting on the space in a [[canonical map|canonical]] way. For example, the [[symmetric group]] of a finite [[set (mathematics)|set]] consists of all [[bijective]] transformations of that set; thus, applying any element of the permutation group to an element of the set will produce another (not necessarily distinct) element of the set. More generally, [[symmetry groups]] such as the [[homeomorphism group]] of a [[topological space]] or the [[general linear group]] of a [[vector space]], as well as their subgroups, also admit canonical actions. For other groups, an interpretation of the group in terms of an action may have to be specified, either because the group does not act canonically on any space or because the canonical action is not the action of interest. For example, we can specify an action of the two-element [[cyclic group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C}_2 = \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; on the finite set &lt;math&gt;\{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt; by specifying that 0 (the identity element) sends &lt;math&gt;a\mapsto a,b\mapsto b,c\mapsto c&lt;/math&gt;, and that 1 sends &lt;math&gt;a\mapsto b,b\mapsto a,c\mapsto c&lt;/math&gt;. This action is not canonical.

A common way of specifying non-canonical actions is to describe a [[homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; from a group ''G'' to the group of symmetries of a set ''X''. The action of an element &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; on a point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be identical to the action of its image &lt;math&gt;\varphi(g) \in \text{Sym}(X)&lt;/math&gt; on the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is also frequently called the "action" of ''G'', since specifying &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to specifying an action. Thus, if ''G'' is a group and ''X'' is a set, then an action of ''G'' on ''X'' may be formally defined as a [[group homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; from ''G'' to the [[symmetric group]] of ''X''. The action assigns a [[permutation]] of ''X'' to each element of the group in such a way that:
* the [[identity element]] of ''G'' is assigned the [[identity transformation]] of ''X'';
* any product ''gk'' of two elements of ''G'' is assigned the [[function composition|composition]] of the permutations assigned to ''g'' and&amp;nbsp;''k''.
If ''X'' has additional structure, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is only called an action if for each &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, the permutation &lt;math&gt;\varphi(g)&lt;/math&gt; preserves the structure of&amp;nbsp;''X''.

The [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] provided by group actions is a powerful one, because it allows geometrical ideas to be applied to more abstract objects. Many objects in mathematics have natural group actions defined on them. In particular, groups can act on other groups, or even on themselves. Because of this generality, the theory of group actions contains wide-reaching [[theorem]]s, such as the orbit stabilizer theorem, which can be used to prove deep results in several fields.

== Definition ==
If ''G'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and ''X'' is a set, then a (''left'') ''group action'' ''&amp;phi;'' of ''G'' on ''X'' is a function
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi\colon G \times X \to X\colon (g,x)\mapsto \varphi(g,x)&lt;/math&gt;
that satisfies the following two axioms (where we denote ''&amp;phi;''(''g'', ''x'') as ''g''⋅''x''):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eie &amp; Chang |title=A Course on Abstract Algebra|year=2010|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=jozIZ0qrkk8C|page=144|text=group action}}|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Identity: {{nowrap|1=''e''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} for all ''x'' in ''X''. (Here, ''e'' denotes the identity element of the group ''G''.)
; Compatibility: {{nowrap|1=(''gh'')⋅''x'' = ''g''⋅(''h''⋅''x'')}} for all ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X''. (Here, ''gh'' denotes the result of applying the group operation of ''G'' to the elements ''g'' and ''h''.)

The group ''G'' is said to act on ''X'' (on the left). The set ''X'' is called a (''left'') ''G-set''.

From these two axioms, it follows that for every ''g'' in ''G'', the function which maps ''x'' in ''X'' to ''g''⋅''x'' is a [[bijective function|bijective map]] from ''X'' to ''X'' (its [[inverse function|inverse]] being the function which maps ''x'' to ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''x''). Therefore, one may alternatively define a group action of ''G'' on ''X'' as a [[group homomorphism]] from ''G'' into the [[symmetric group]] Sym(''X'') of all bijections from ''X'' to ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;This is done, e.g., by {{cite book|author=Smith |title=Introduction to abstract algebra|year=2008|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=PQUAQh04lrUC|page=253|text=group action}}|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In complete analogy, one can define a ''right group action'' of ''G'' on ''X'' as an operation {{nowrap|''X'' × ''G'' → ''X''}} mapping {{nowrap|(''x'', ''g'')}} to ''x''⋅''g'' and satisfying the two axioms:
; Identity: {{nowrap|1=''x''⋅''e'' = ''x''}} for all ''x'' in ''X''.
; Compatibility: {{nowrap|1=''x''⋅(''gh'') = (''x''⋅''g'')⋅''h''}} for all ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X'';

The difference between left and right actions is in the order in which a product like ''gh'' acts on ''x''. For a left action ''h'' acts first and is followed by ''g'', while for a right action ''g'' acts first and is followed by ''h''. Because of the formula {{nowrap|1=(''gh'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, one can construct a left action from a right action by composing with the inverse operation of the group. Also, a right action of a group ''G'' on ''X'' is the same thing as a left action of its [[opposite group]] ''G''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; on ''X''. It is thus sufficient to only consider left actions without any loss of generality.

== Types of actions ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Diffeomorphism]], and redirected from "Transitive action" --&gt;
The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is called
* ''{{visible anchor|Transitive}}'' if ''X'' is non-empty and if for each pair ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'' there exists a ''g'' in ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''y''}}. For example, the action of the symmetric group of ''X'' is transitive, the action of the [[general linear group]] or the [[special linear group]] of a vector space ''V'' on {{nowrap|''V'' ∖ {0}{{null}}}} is transitive, but the action of the [[orthogonal group]] of a [[Euclidean space]] ''E'' is not transitive on {{nowrap|''E'' ∖ {0}{{null}}}} (it is transitive on the [[unit sphere]] of ''E'', though).
* ''{{visible anchor|Faithful}}'' (or ''{{visible anchor|effective}}'') if for every two distinct ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' ≠ ''h''⋅''x''}}; or equivalently, if for each {{nowrap|''g'' ≠ ''e''}} in ''G'' there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' such that {{nowrap|''g''⋅''x'' ≠ ''x''}}.  In other words, in a faithful group action, different elements of ''G'' induce different permutations of ''X''. In algebraic terms, a group ''G'' acts faithfully on ''X'' [[if and only if]] the corresponding homomorphism to the symmetric group, {{nowrap|''G'' → Sym(''X'')}}, has a trivial [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]]. Thus, for a faithful action, ''G'' embeds into a [[permutation group]] on ''X''; specifically, ''G'' is isomorphic to its image in Sym(''X''). If ''G'' does not act faithfully on ''X'', one can easily modify the group to obtain a faithful action. If we define {{nowrap|1=''N'' = {''g'' in ''G'' : ''g''⋅''x'' = ''x'' for all ''x'' in ''X''}{{null}}}}, then ''N'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of ''G''; indeed, it is the kernel of the homomorphism {{nowrap|''G'' → Sym(''X'')}}. The [[factor group]] ''G''/''N'' acts faithfully on ''X'' by setting {{nowrap|1=(''gN'')⋅''x'' = ''g''⋅''x''}}. The original action of ''G'' on ''X'' is faithful if and only if {{nowrap|1=''N'' = {''e''}{{null}}}}.
* ''{{visible anchor|Free}}'' (or ''semiregular'' or ''fixed point free'') if, given ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'', the existence of an ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''h''⋅''x''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''h''}}. Equivalently: if ''g'' is a group element and there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} (that is, if ''g'' has at least one fixed point), then ''g'' is the identity. Note that a free action on a [[non-empty]] set is faithful.
* ''{{visible anchor|Regular}}'' (or ''{{visible anchor|simply transitive}}'' or ''sharply transitive'') if it is both transitive and free; this is equivalent to saying that for every two ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'' there exists precisely one ''g'' in ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''y''}}.  In this case, ''X'' is called a [[principal homogeneous space]] for ''G'' or a ''G''-torsor. The action of any group ''G'' on itself by left multiplication is regular, and thus faithful as well. Every group can, therefore, be embedded in the symmetric group on its own elements, Sym(''G''). This result is known as [[Cayley's theorem]].
* ''{{visible anchor|n-transitive}}'' if ''X'' has at least ''n'' elements and for all pairwise distinct ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and pairwise distinct ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' there is a ''g'' in ''G'' such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n''}}.  A 2-transitive action is also called ''{{visible anchor|doubly transitive}}'', a 3-transitive action is also called ''triply transitive'', and so on.  Such actions define interesting classes of subgroups in the symmetric groups: [[2-transitive group]]s and more generally [[multiply transitive group]]s. The action of the symmetric group on a set with ''n'' elements is always ''n''-transitive; the action of the [[alternating group]] is ''n-2''-transitive.
* ''{{visible anchor|Sharply n-transitive}}'' if there is exactly one such ''g''.
* ''{{visible anchor|Primitive}}'' if it is transitive and preserves no non-trivial partition of ''X''. See [[primitive permutation group]] for details.
* ''Locally free'' if ''G'' is a [[topological group]], and there is a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] ''U'' of ''e'' in ''G'' such that the restriction of the action to ''U'' is free; that is, if  {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} for some ''x'' and some ''g'' in ''U'' then {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''e''}}.

Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts on a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then the action is:

*''Wandering'' if every point &lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt; has a neighbourhood &lt;math&gt; U &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\{g \in G : g \cdot U \cap U \neq \emptyset\}&lt;/math&gt; is finite.&lt;ref name="Thurston 1980 p175"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Thurston | first1=William | title=The geometry and topology of three-manifolds | url=http://library.msri.org/books/gt3m/ | series=Princeton lecture notes | year=1980 | page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the action of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z^n&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; by translations is wandering. The action of the [[modular group]] on the Poincaré half-plane is also wandering.
*''Properly discontinuous'' if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[locally compact space]] and for every compact subset &lt;math&gt;K \subset X&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;\{g \in G: gK \cap K \neq \emptyset \}&lt;/math&gt; is finite. The wandering actions given above are also properly discontinuous. On the other hand, the action of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^2 \setminus \{0\}&lt;/math&gt; by the linear map &lt;math&gt;(x, y) \mapsto (2x, 1/2y)&lt;/math&gt; is wandering and free but not properly discontinuous.{{sfn|Thurston|1980|p=176}}
*''{{visible anchor|Proper}}'' if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a topological group and the map from &lt;math&gt;G \times X \rightarrow X \times X : (g,x) \mapsto (g \cdot x,x)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Proper map|proper]].&lt;ref name="tom Dieck 1987 p29"&gt;{{Citation | last1=tom Dieck | first1=Tammo | title=Transformation groups | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=azcQhi6XeioC | publisher=Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co. | location=Berlin | series=de Gruyter Studies in Mathematics | isbn=978-3-11-009745-0 | mr=889050 | year=1987 | volume=8 | page=29 | doi=10.1515/9783110858372.312}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''G'' is [[Discrete group|discrete]] then properness is equivalent to proper discontinuity for ''G''-actions.
* Said to have ''discrete orbits'' if the orbit of each &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; under the action of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is discrete in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Thurston 1980 p175" /&gt;

If ''X'' is a non-zero [[module (mathematics)|module]] over a ring ''R'' and the action of ''G'' is ''R''-linear then it is said to be 
* ''Irreducible'' if there is no nonzero proper invariant submodule.

==&lt;span id="orbstab"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="quotient"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Orbits and stabilizers ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Symmetry]] --&gt;
[[File:Compound of five tetrahedra.png|thumb|In the [[compound of five tetrahedra]], the symmetry group is the (rotational) [[icosahedral group]] ''I'' of order 60, while the stabilizer of a single chosen tetrahedron is the (rotational) [[tetrahedral group]] ''T'' of order 12, and the orbit space ''I''/''T'' (of order 60/12&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5) is naturally identified with the 5 tetrahedra – the coset ''gT'' corresponds to the tetrahedron to which ''g'' sends the chosen tetrahedron.]]

Consider a group ''G'' acting on a set ''X''. The ''orbit'' of an element ''x'' in ''X'' is the set of elements in ''X'' to which ''x'' can be moved by the elements of ''G''. The orbit of ''x'' is denoted by ''G''⋅''x'':

:&lt;math&gt; G\cdot x = \left\{ g\cdot x \mid g \in G \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The defining properties of a group guarantee that the set of orbits of (points ''x'' in) ''X'' under the action of ''G'' form a [[partition of a set|partition]] of ''X''. The associated [[equivalence relation]] is defined by saying {{nowrap|''x'' ∼ ''y''}} [[if and only if]] there exists a ''g'' in ''G'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''y''}}. The orbits are then the [[equivalence class]]es under this relation; two elements ''x'' and ''y'' are equivalent if and only if their orbits are the same; i.e., {{nowrap|1=''G''⋅''x'' = ''G''⋅''y''}}.

The group action is [[Group action#Types of actions|transitive]] if and only if it has exactly one orbit, i.e., if there exists ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''G''⋅''x'' = ''X''}}. This is the case if and only if {{nowrap|1=''G''⋅''x'' = ''X''}} for ''all'' ''x'' in ''X''.

The set of all orbits of ''X'' under the action of ''G'' is written as ''X''/''G'' (or, less frequently: ''G''\''X''), and is called the ''quotient'' of the action. In geometric situations it may be called the ''{{visible anchor|orbit space}}'', while in algebraic situations it may be called the space of ''{{visible anchor|coinvariants}}'', and written ''X&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'',  by contrast with the invariants (fixed points), denoted ''X&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;'': the coinvariants are a ''quotient'' while the invariants are a ''subset.'' The coinvariant terminology and notation are used particularly in [[group cohomology]] and [[group homology]], which use the same superscript/subscript convention.

===Invariant subsets===
If ''Y'' is a [[subset]] of ''X'', we write ''GY'' for the set {{nowrap|{ ''g''⋅''y'' : ''y'' ∈ ''Y'' and ''g'' ∈ ''G''}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}. We call the subset ''Y'' ''invariant under G'' if {{nowrap|1=''G''⋅''Y'' = ''Y''}} (which is equivalent to {{nowrap|''G''⋅''Y'' ⊆ ''Y''}}). In that case, ''G'' also operates on ''Y'' by restricting the action to ''Y''. The subset ''Y'' is called ''fixed under G'' if {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''y'' = ''y''}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''y'' in ''Y''. Every subset that is fixed under ''G'' is also invariant under ''G'', but not vice versa.

Every orbit is an invariant subset of ''X'' on which ''G'' acts [[Group action#Types of actions|transitively]]. The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is ''transitive'' if and only if all elements are equivalent, meaning that there is only one orbit.

A ''G-invariant'' element of ''X'' is {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} for all {{nowrap|''g'' ∈ ''G''}}. The set of all such ''x'' is denoted ''X&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;'' and called the ''G-invariants'' of ''X''. When ''X'' is a [[G-module|''G''-module]], ''X&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the zeroth [[group cohomology]] group of ''G'' with coefficients in ''X'', and the higher cohomology groups are the [[derived functor]]s of the [[functor]] of ''G''-invariants.

===Fixed points and stabilizer subgroups===
Given ''g'' in ''G'' and ''x'' in ''X'' with {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}}, we say ''x'' is a fixed point of ''g'' and ''g'' fixes ''x''.

For every ''x'' in ''X'', we define the ''stabilizer subgroup'' of ''G'' with respect to ''x'' (also called the ''isotropy group'' or ''little group''&lt;ref name="Procesi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Procesi|first1=Claudio|title=Lie Groups: An Approach through Invariants and Representations|date=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780387289298|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sl8OAGYRz_AC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22little+group%22+action&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP0P3X5qbSAhXriFQKHfNLDDsQ6AEIODAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22little%20group%22%20action&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as the set of all elements in ''G'' that fix ''x'':
:&lt;math&gt;G_x = \{g \in G \mid g \cdot x = x\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is a [[subgroup]] of ''G'', though typically not a normal one. The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is [[Group action#Types of actions|free]] if and only if all stabilizers are trivial. The kernel ''N'' of the homomorphism with the symmetric group, {{nowrap|''G'' → Sym(''X'')}}, is given by the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the stabilizers ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all ''x'' in ''X''. If ''N'' is trivial, the action is said to be faithful (or effective).

Let ''x'' and ''y'' be two elements in ''X'', and let ''g'' be a group element such that {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''g''⋅''x''}}. Then the two stabilizer groups ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''G&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' are related by {{nowrap|1=''G&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''g'' ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Proof: by definition, {{nowrap|''h'' &amp;isin; ''G&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=''h''⋅(''g''⋅''x'') = ''g''⋅''x''}}. Applying ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to both sides of this equality yields {{nowrap|1=(''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''hg'')⋅''x'' = ''x''}}; that is, {{nowrap|''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''hg'' &amp;isin; ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. An opposite inclusion follows similarly by taking {{nowrap|''h'' &amp;isin; ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and supposing {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''y''}}.

The above says that the stabilizers of elements in the same orbit are [[Conjugacy class|conjugate]] to each other. Thus, to each orbit, one can associate a conjugacy class of a subgroup of ''G'' (i.e., the set of all conjugates of the subgroup). Let &lt;math&gt;(H)&lt;/math&gt; denote the conjugacy class of ''H''. Then one says that the orbit ''O'' has type &lt;math&gt;(H)&lt;/math&gt; if the stabilizer &lt;math&gt;G_x&lt;/math&gt; of some/any ''x'' in ''O'' belongs to &lt;math&gt;(H)&lt;/math&gt;. A maximal orbit type is often called a [[principal orbit type]].

==={{visible anchor|Orbit-stabilizer theorem}} and Burnside's lemma===
Orbits and stabilizers are closely related. For a fixed &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, consider the map &lt;math&gt;G\to X&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;g \mapsto g\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;. This map induces a bijection from the set &lt;math&gt;G/G_x&lt;/math&gt; of  [[coset]]s of &lt;math&gt;G_x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to the orbit &lt;math&gt;G\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, as the translate &lt;math&gt;g\cdot x&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the left coset &lt;math&gt;gG_x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Artin, &lt;em&gt;Algebra&lt;/em&gt;, Proposition 6.4 on p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;. This result is known as the ''orbit-stabilizer theorem''. 

If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is finite then the orbit-stabilizer theorem, together with [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]], gives
:&lt;math&gt;|G\cdot x| = [G\,:\,G_x] = |G| / |G_x|.&lt;/math&gt;

This result is especially useful since it can be employed for counting arguments (typically in situations where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is finite as well).

[[File:Labeled cube graph.png|thumb|Cubical graph with vertices labeled]]
: '''Example:'''  One can use the orbit-stabilizer theorem to count the automorphisms of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. Consider the [[cubical graph]] as pictured, and let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; denote its [[Graph automorphism|automorphism]] group. Then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts on the set of vertices &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,\ldots,8\}&lt;/math&gt;, and this action is transitive as can be seen by composing rotations about the center of the cube. Thus, by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we have that &lt;math&gt;|G| = |G\cdot1||G_1| = 8|G_1|&lt;/math&gt;. Applying the theorem now to the stabilizer &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain &lt;math&gt;|G_1| = |(G_1)\cdot2||(G_1)_2|&lt;/math&gt;. Any element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that fixes &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; must send &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; to either &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;. There are such automorphisms; consider for example the map that transposes &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;, transposes &lt;math&gt;6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;8&lt;/math&gt;, and fixes the other vertices. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\left|(G_1)\cdot2\right| = 3&lt;/math&gt;. Applying the theorem a third time gives &lt;math&gt;|(G_1)_2| = |((G_1)_2)\cdot3||((G_1)_2)_3|&lt;/math&gt;. Any element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that fixes &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; must send &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; to either &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;6&lt;/math&gt;, and one easily finds such automorphisms. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\left|((G_1)_2)\cdot3\right| = 2&lt;/math&gt;. One also sees that &lt;math&gt;((G_1)_2)_3&lt;/math&gt; consists only of the identity automorphism, as any element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; fixing &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; must also fix &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; and consequently all other vertices. Combining the preceding calculations, we now obtain &lt;math&gt;|G| = 8\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1 = 48&lt;/math&gt;.

A result closely related to the orbit-stabilizer theorem is [[Burnside's lemma]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\left|X/G\right|=\frac{1}{\left|G\right|}\sum_{g\in G}\left|X^g\right|&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;X^g&lt;/math&gt; the set of points fixed by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. This result is mainly of use when &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are finite, when it can be interpreted as follows: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of points fixed per group element.

Fixing a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, the set of formal differences of finite &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-sets forms a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] called the [[Burnside ring]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, where addition corresponds to [[disjoint union]], and multiplication to [[Cartesian product]].

== Examples ==
* The ''{{visible anchor|trivial}}'' action of any group ''G'' on any set ''X'' is defined by {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''x''}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X''; that is, every group element induces the [[identity function|identity permutation]] on ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eie &amp; Chang |title=A Course on Abstract Algebra|year=2010|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=jozIZ0qrkk8C|page=144|text=trivial action}}|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In every group ''G'', left multiplication is an action of ''G'' on ''G'': {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''gx''}} for all ''g'', ''x'' in ''G''. This action forms the basis of a rapid proof of [[Cayley's theorem]] - that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group of permutations of the set ''G''.
* In every group ''G'' with subgroup ''H'', left multiplication is an action of ''G'' on the set of cosets ''G/H'': {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''aH'' = ''gaH''}} for all ''g'',''a'' in ''G''. In particular if H contains no nontrivial normal subgroups of ''G'' this induces an isomorphism from ''G'' to a subgroup of the permutation group of degree ''[G : H]''.
* In every group ''G'', [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] is an action of ''G'' on ''G'': {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''x'' = ''gxg''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. An exponential notation is commonly used for the right-action variant: {{nowrap|1=''x&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''xg''}}; it satisfies ({{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''gh''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
* In every group ''G'' with subgroup ''H'', [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] is an action of ''G'' on conjugates of ''H'': {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''K'' = ''gKg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and ''K'' conjugates of ''H''.
* The [[symmetric group]] S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and its [[subgroup]]s act on the set {{nowrap|{ 1, …, ''n'' }&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} by permuting its elements
* The [[symmetry group]] of a [[polyhedron]] acts on the set of vertices of that polyhedron. It also acts on the set of faces or the set of edges of the polyhedron.
* The symmetry group of any geometrical object acts on the set of points of that object.
* The [[automorphism group]] of a [[vector space]] (or [[graph theory|graph]], or group, or [[ring (algebra)|ring]]…) acts on the vector space (or set of vertices of the graph, or group, or ring…).
* The [[general linear group]] {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''K'')}} and its subgroups, particularly its [[Lie subgroup]]s (including the [[special linear group]] {{nowrap|SL(''n'', ''K'')}}, [[orthogonal group]] {{nowrap|O(''n'', ''K'')}}, special orthogonal group {{nowrap|SO(''n'', ''K'')}}, and [[symplectic group]] {{nowrap|Sp(''n'', ''K'')}}) are [[Lie group]]s that act on the [[vector space]] ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The group operations are given by multiplying the matrices from the groups with the vectors from ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The [[general linear group]] {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''Z''')}} acts on '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; by natural matrix action. The orbits of its action are classified by the greatest common divisor of coordinates of the vector in '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The [[affine group]] acts [[#Types of actions|transitively]] on the points of an [[affine space]], and the subgroup V of the affine group (i.e., a vector space) transitive and free (i.e., ''regular'') action on these points;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geometry and topology|last=Reid|first=Miles|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780521613255|location=Cambridge, UK New York|pages=170|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed this can be used to give a definition of an [[Affine space#Definition|affine space]].
* The [[projective linear group]] {{nowrap|PGL(''n'' + 1, ''K'')}} and its subgroups, particularly its Lie subgroups, which are Lie groups that act on the [[projective space]] '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(''K''). This is a quotient of the action of the general linear group on projective space. Particularly notable is {{nowrap|PGL(2, ''K'')}}, the symmetries of the projective line, which is sharply 3-transitive, preserving the [[cross ratio]]; the [[Möbius group]] {{nowrap|PGL(2, '''C''')}} is of particular interest.
*The [[Isometry|isometries]] of the plane act on the set of 2D images and patterns, such as [[wallpaper group|wallpaper pattern]]s. The definition can be made more precise by specifying what is meant by image or pattern; e.g., a function of position with values in a set of colors. Isometries are in fact one example of affine group (action).{{dubious|reason=The isometries of a space are a subgroup of the affine group of that space, but not an affine group in themselves|date=March 2015}}
*The sets acted on by a group G comprise the category of G-sets in which the objects are G-sets and the morphisms are G-set homomorphisms: functions {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅(''f''(''x'')) = ''f''(''g''⋅''x'')}} for every ''g'' in ''G''.
* The [[Galois group]] of a [[field extension]] ''L''/''K'' acts on the field L but has only a trivial action on elements of the subfield K. Subgroups of Gal(L/K) correspond to subfields of L that contain K, i.e., intermediate field extensions between L and K.
* The additive group of the [[real number]]s {{nowrap|('''R''', +)}} acts on the [[phase space]] of "[[well-behaved]]" systems in [[classical mechanics]] (and in more general [[dynamical systems]]) by [[time translation]]: if ''t'' is in '''R''' and ''x'' is in the phase space, then ''x'' describes a state of the system, and {{nowrap|''t'' + ''x''}} is defined to be the state of the system ''t'' seconds later if ''t'' is positive or &amp;minus;''t'' seconds ago if ''t'' is negative.
*The additive group of the real numbers {{nowrap|('''R''', +)}} acts on the set of real functions of a real variable in various ways, with (''t''⋅''f'')(''x'') equal to, e.g., {{nowrap|''f''(''x'' + ''t'')}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') + ''t''}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''xe&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'')}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''x'')''e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, {{nowrap|''f''(''x'' + ''t'')''e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, or {{nowrap|''f''(''xe&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'') + ''t''}}, but not {{nowrap|''f''(''xe&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' + ''t'')}}.
*Given a group action of ''G'' on ''X'', we can define an induced action of ''G'' on the [[power set]] of ''X'', by setting {{nowrap|1=''g''⋅''U'' = {''g''⋅''u'' : ''u'' ∈ ''U''}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} for every subset ''U'' of ''X'' and every ''g'' in ''G''. This is useful, for instance, in studying the action of the large [[Mathieu group]] on a 24-set and in studying symmetry in certain models of [[finite geometry|finite geometries]].
* The [[quaternions]] with [[Norm of a quaternion|norm]] 1 (the [[versor]]s), as a multiplicative group, act on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: for any such quaternion {{nowrap|1=''z'' = cos ''α''/2 + '''v''' sin ''α''/2}}, the mapping {{nowrap|1=''f''('''x''') = ''z'''''x'''''z''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a counterclockwise rotation through an angle ''α'' about an axis given by a unit vector '''v'''; ''z'' is the same rotation; see [[quaternions and spatial rotation]].

== Group actions and groupoids ==
The notion of group action can be put in a broader context by using the ''action [[groupoid]]'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle G' \;=\;  G \,\ltimes\, X&lt;/math&gt;  associated to the group action, thus allowing techniques from groupoid theory such as presentations and [[fibration]]s. Further the stabilizers of the action are the vertex groups,  and the orbits of the action are the components, of the action groupoid. For more details, see the book ''Topology and groupoids'' referenced below.

This action groupoid comes with a morphism &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p:\; G' \,\rightarrow\, G&lt;/math&gt; which is a ''covering morphism of groupoids''. This allows a relation between such morphisms and [[covering maps]] in topology.

== Morphisms and isomorphisms between ''G''-sets ==
If ''X'' and ''Y'' are two ''G''-sets, we define a ''[[morphism]]'' from ''X'' to ''Y'' to be a function {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''f''(''g''⋅''x'') = ''g''⋅''f''(''x'')}} for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X''. Morphisms of ''G''-sets are also called ''[[equivariant map]]s'' or ''G-maps''.

The composition of two morphisms is again a morphism.

If a morphism ''f'' is [[bijective]], then its inverse is also a morphism, and we call ''f'' an ''[[isomorphism]]'' and the two ''G''-sets ''X'' and ''Y'' are called ''isomorphic''; for all practical purposes, they are indistinguishable in this case.

Some example isomorphisms:
* Every regular ''G'' action is isomorphic to the action of ''G'' on ''G'' given by left multiplication.
* Every free ''G'' action is isomorphic to {{nowrap|''G'' × ''S''}}, where ''S'' is some set and ''G'' acts on {{nowrap|''G'' × ''S''}} by left multiplication on the first coordinate. (''S'' can be taken to be the set of orbits ''X''/''G''.)
* Every transitive ''G'' action is isomorphic to left multiplication by ''G'' on the set of left [[coset]]s of some [[subgroup]] ''H'' of ''G''. (''H'' can be taken to be the stabilizer group of any element of the original ''G''-set.the original action.)

With this notion of morphism, the collection of all ''G''-sets forms a [[category theory|category]]; this category is a [[Grothendieck topos]] (in fact, assuming a classical metalogic, this topos will even be Boolean).

== Continuous group actions ==
{{main article|continuous group action}}

One often considers ''continuous group actions'': the group ''G'' is a [[topological group]], ''X'' is a [[topological space]], and the map {{nowrap|''G'' × ''X'' → ''X''}} is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] with respect to the [[product topology]] of {{nowrap|''G'' × ''X''}}. The space ''X'' is also called a ''G-space'' in this case. This is indeed a generalization, since every group can be considered a topological group by using the [[discrete space|discrete topology]]. All the concepts introduced above still work in this context, however we define morphisms between ''G''-spaces to be ''continuous'' maps compatible with the action of ''G''. The quotient ''X''/''G'' inherits the [[quotient topology]] from ''X'', and is called the ''quotient space'' of the action. The above statements about isomorphisms for regular, free and transitive actions are no longer valid for continuous group actions.

If ''X'' is a [[Covering map#Deck transformation group, regular covers|regular covering space]] of another topological space ''Y'', then the action of the [[Covering map#Deck transformation group, regular covers|deck transformation group]]  on ''X'' is properly discontinuous as well as being free. Every free, properly discontinuous action of a group ''G'' on a [[path-connected]] topological space ''X'' arises in this manner: the quotient map {{nowrap|''X'' ↦ ''X''/''G''}} is a regular covering map, and the deck transformation group is the given action of ''G'' on ''X''. Furthermore, if ''X'' is simply connected, the fundamental group of ''X''/''G'' will be isomorphic to ''G''.

These results  have been generalized in the book ''Topology and Groupoids'' referenced below to obtain the [[fundamental groupoid]] of the orbit space of a discontinuous action of a discrete group on a Hausdorff space, as,  under reasonable  local conditions, the orbit groupoid of the fundamental groupoid of the space. This allows calculations such as the fundamental group of the [[symmetric square]] of a space ''X'', namely the orbit space of the product of ''X'' with itself under the twist action of the cyclic group of order 2 sending {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} to {{nowrap|(''y'', ''x'')}}.

An action of a group ''G'' on a [[locally compact space]] ''X'' is ''cocompact'' if there exists a compact subset ''A'' of ''X'' such that {{nowrap|1=''GA'' = ''X''}}. For a properly discontinuous action, cocompactness is equivalent to compactness of the quotient space ''X/G''.

The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is said to be ''proper'' if the mapping {{nowrap|''G'' × ''X'' → ''X'' × ''X''}} that sends {{nowrap|(''g'', ''x'') ↦ (''g⋅x'', ''x'')}} is a [[proper map]].

===Strongly continuous group action and smooth points===
A group action of a topological group ''G'' on a topological space ''X'' is said to be ''strongly continuous'' if for all ''x'' in ''X'', the map {{nowrap|''g'' ↦ ''g''⋅''x''}} is continuous with respect to the respective topologies. Such an action induces an action on the space of continuous functions on ''X'' by defining {{nowrap|1=(''g''⋅''f'')(''x'') = ''f''(''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''x'')}} for every ''g'' in ''G'', ''f'' a continuous function on ''X'', and ''x'' in ''X''. Note that, while every continuous group action is strongly continuous, the converse is not in general true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The subspace of ''smooth points'' for the action is the subspace of ''X'' of points ''x'' such that {{nowrap|''g'' ↦ ''g''⋅''x''}} is smooth; i.e., it is continuous and all derivatives{{where|date=August 2013}} are continuous.

== Variants and generalizations ==
One can also consider actions of [[monoid]]s on sets, by using the same two axioms as above. This does not define bijective maps and equivalence relations however. See [[semigroup action]].

Instead of actions on sets, one can define actions of groups and monoids on objects of an arbitrary [[category theory|category]]: start with an object ''X'' of some category, and then define an action on ''X'' as a monoid homomorphism into the monoid of endomorphisms of ''X''. If ''X'' has an underlying set, then all definitions and facts stated above can be carried over. For example, if we take the category of [[vector space]]s, we obtain [[group representation]]s in this fashion.

One can view a group ''G'' as a category with a single object in which every [[morphism]] is invertible. A (left) group action is then nothing but a (covariant) [[functor]] from ''G'' to the [[category of sets]], and a group representation is a functor from ''G'' to the [[category of vector spaces]]. A morphism between G-sets is then a [[natural transformation]] between the group action functors.  In analogy, an action of a [[groupoid]] is a functor from the groupoid to the category of sets or to some other category.

In addition to [[continuous group action|continuous actions]] of topological groups on topological spaces, one also often considers [[Lie group action|smooth actions]] of [[Lie groups]] on [[manifold|smooth manifold]]s, regular actions of [[algebraic group]]s on [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], and [[group-scheme action|actions]] of [[group scheme]]s on [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. All of these are examples of [[group object]]s acting on objects of their respective category.

{{See also|Hacker (term)}}
At MIT, the terms ''hack'' and ''hacker'' have many shades of meaning,&lt;ref name=JargonFile&gt;{{cite web|last=Raymond|first=Eric|title=The Meaning of 'Hack'|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/meaning-of-hack.html|website=The Jargon File (version 4.4.7)|accessdate=2011-05-03|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HHH&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Sam|title=Hack, Hackers, and Hacking|url=http://www.faifzilla.org/appendixb.html|website=FAIFzilla.org [website]|publisher=Sam Williams|accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HackDefinitionBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.

The origin of this usage is unknown, but it seems to have been widespread at MIT by the 1960s, and the [[hacker ethic]] has since spread into [[cyberculture]] and beyond.  Over time, the term has been generalized to describe anybody who possesses great technical proficiency in any particular skill, usually combined with an offbeat sense of humor.  The manifestation of hacker culture in the form of spectacular pranks is the most visible aspect of this culture to the world at large, but many hacker subcultures exist at MIT, and elsewhere.  This article focuses mostly on prankish aspects; for a fuller description of hacker culture, see "[[Hacker (term)]]".

[[Roof and tunnel hacking]], a form of [[urban exploration]], is also related to but not identical to "hacking" as described in this article.  Some hacks do involve overcoming barriers to physical access (e.g. placing a half-scale [[Apollo Lunar Module]] atop the Great Dome),&lt;ref name=ApolloHack&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo Lunar Module on the Great Dome|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2009/apollo_lander/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but many other stunts do not require such specialized skills.

==Cultural aspects==
Viewed from an [[anthropology|anthropological]] perspective, hacking is a cultural tradition affirming [[social cohesion|group solidarity]], but some hacks can also be viewed as individualistic creative or [[artistic expression]].  For example the "Massachusetts Toolpike" hack&lt;ref name=Tech11040&gt;{{cite web|last=Mehta|first=Prabhat|title=Journal of IHTFP a joyful account of MIT hacks|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V110/N40/hacks.40a.html|website=The Tech|accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was a clear instance of [[installation art]]&lt;ref name=GnomeInfestationWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Gnome Infestation|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2003/gnomes/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KeypadArtWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Cluster keypad artwork|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2003/keypad_art/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or [[environmental art]].&lt;ref name=RockGardenHackWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Squanch Rock Garden in 2-4-6 Courtyard|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2000/tetazoo_garden/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hacks which involve staged public actions&lt;ref name=BOYD&gt;{{cite web|title=Bring out your Dead|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1996/dead/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PerfHackWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Performance Hacks|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_topic/performance.html|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PerfHackBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.

"Tribute", "memorial", or "commemorative" hacks note the arrival, passing, or anniversary of some noteworthy person, tradition, institution, or idea (e.g. the 10th anniversary of Wikipedia).&lt;ref name=Wiki10th&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikipedia 10th Anniversary|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2011/wikipedia/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another broad category of hacks contains strong elements of [[social commentary]] or [[demonstration (people)|street protest]] (e.g. "Nth Annual Spontaneous Tuition Riot"&lt;ref name=TechTuition&gt;{{cite web|last=Chung|first=Jennifer|title=Students Protest Tuition Hike During Traditional Annual Riot|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V119/PDF/N12.pdf|website=The Tech|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;) about events on campus or in the world at large.  But the strongest element of many hacks is the sheer joy of conceptualizing something new, and then reifying it with effective engineering, both technical and social (e.g. installing a full-sized mockup solar-powered subway car on the parapet wall around the base of the Great Dome, and then ''driving it back and forth under remote wireless control'' from Killian Court, some five stories below, ''after sundown'').&lt;ref name=SolarSubwayWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Powered Subway Car on the Great Dome|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2009/solar_powered_subway/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SolarSubwayBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.F.|title=Nightwork: a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=13, 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most art exhibitions, the great majority of hacks are temporary installations; most are removed within a day or so by MIT Physical Plant, the MIT Confined Space Rescue Team (CSRT),&lt;ref name=HackCSRTBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork: a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=192–195|chapter=Zen and the art of hacking; It's not a job, it's an adventure}}&lt;/ref&gt; or occasionally by the hackers themselves.  It is a traditional courtesy to leave a note or even engineering drawings behind, as an aid to safe de-installation of a hack.&lt;ref name="HackCSRTBook"/&gt;  Sometimes, the hacks have been de-installed so quickly that members of the MIT community and the general public have had little opportunity to view them.  On very rare occasions, community protests have caused the MIT administration to quietly allow a hack to be re-installed and left for a proper viewing interval.&lt;ref name=Kilroy&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.

The [[MIT Museum]] maintains an extensive collection of original hacker artifacts and documentation, and displays some larger items semi-permanently in the [[Ray and Maria Stata Center|Stata Center]].&lt;ref name="StataHacks"/&gt;

Although many traditional college pranks have involved maximizing embarrassment or inconvenience for a victim or target, such antics are usually disparaged by MIT hackers as "unimaginative" or "boring".  Often the target of a hack is an abstract concept (e.g. [[bureaucracy]] or "[[political correctness]]", or [[entropy]]), and the prank may or may not be aimed at any specific individual.  Even when an individual is targeted (e.g. the "disappearing office"&lt;ref name=VestOffice&gt;{{cite web|title=The Disappearing President's Office (The Bulletin Board Hack)|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1990/vest_bboard/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TechVest&gt;{{cite web|title=Moving the Institute forward into the next century, Charles Vest thinks globally|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V110/N43/vest.43n.html|website=The Tech|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of newly arrived MIT President [[Charles Marstiller Vest|Charles Vest]]), the jest is good-natured, often eliciting admiration rather than anger from the "victim".

Writers for the third-party, independent Internet prankster site ''Zug'' once compared humorous responses at MIT and Harvard, by posting similar banners over main entrances to their respective campuses which proclaimed "Institute of Nowlege".  Regarding Harvard, they concluded, "The question: is the sense of humor still alive in modern-day Harvard students? The answer, it turns out, is ''no''."  Regarding MIT, they said, "So it's official: MIT students have a better sense of humor, hands down, than Harvard students. MIT students are more imaginative, more fun-loving, and probably smarter as well.  Truly, MIT is the Institute of NOWLEGE."  The ''Zug'' pranksters also noted and documented great differences in the reactions of [[campus police]], maintenance workers, and passersby, upon seeing the ironically [[pun]]ned banners.&lt;ref name=ZugHarvardMIT&gt;{{cite web|last=Hargrave |first=John |title=Harvard vs. MIT: Who Has the Better Sense of Humor? |url=http://www.zug.com/pranks/harvard-vs-mit/index.html |website=Zug: Prank You Very Much |publisher=Media Shower, Inc. |accessdate=2011-05-12 |author2=Mike Hoban |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104202203/http://www.zug.com/pranks/harvard-vs-mit/index.html |archivedate=January 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT hacks can push the limits of technical skill, and sometimes fail in spite of meticulous planning.  Even these engineering failures have been acknowledged to have educational value, and sometimes a follow-up attempt succeeds. One hack on the Great Dome is documented as having finally succeeded on the fourth try, after a complete re-engineering of both the installed artifact and the installation method.&lt;ref name=HackNippleBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork : a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=56–57|chapter=Domework: hacking the domes; Dome as dais; The great breast of knowledge, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller projects that can be completed by an individual student are sometimes accorded the honorific "a great hack" by other students, if they combine technical elegance with a hackish sense of humor.  For example, an MIT undergrad transformed an ordinary grocery [[shopping cart]] into a high-performance [[electric vehicle]], and had been frequently seen riding around campus in his "LOLrioKart".&lt;ref name=GizmodoKart&gt;{{cite web|last=Frucci|first=Adam|title=MIT Students Build a Speedy Go-Kart Out of a Shopping Cart|url=https://gizmodo.com/5303616/mit-students-build-a-speedy-go+kart-out-of-a-shopping-cart|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shopping cart had a claimed top speed over {{convert|45|mph}}, and also had a complex steering wheel linkage and a low [[Steering|turning radius]] for maneuverability in tight spaces.  The student was a strong advocate of the [[open-source hardware|Open Source Hardware]] philosophy, and incorporated detailed documentation of his projects and a tutorial on building custom [[wheel hub motor]]s in his blog.&lt;ref name=GuanBlog&gt;{{cite web|last=Guan|first=Charles Z|title=[Homepage]|url=http://www.etotheipiplusone.net/|website=Equals zero|publisher=etotheipiplusone.net|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ersatz vehicle was prominently displayed at many MIT events, as well as at the [[Cambridge Science Festival]].  As a crowning mark of recognition by the outside world, the LOLrioKart driver once received a traffic ticket from the Cambridge Police, a copy of which was proudly displayed online.&lt;ref name=TrafficTicket&gt;{{cite web|last=Guan|first=Charles Z|title=I Love Cambridge|url=http://miters.mit.edu/2009/08/30/i-love-cambridge/|website=MITERS [Blog]|publisher=MIT Electronic Research Society (MITERS)|accessdate=2011-05-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225093506/http://miters.mit.edu/2009/08/30/i-love-cambridge/|archivedate=2011-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the best large-scale hacks (e.g. the Caltech cannon heist) have involved multiple teams of hackers working on coordinated but diverse subtasks such as fund-raising, "[[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]]", [[Rigger (industry)|rigging]], [[logistics|transportation logistics]], [[electroplating|gold electroplating]], and precision [[numerical control|numerical controlled machining]], calling on a wide range of technical and management skills.&lt;ref name=CalCannon&gt;{{cite web|title=Caltech's Fleming Cannon transported to MIT|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2006/mitcannon/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not surprisingly, some hacker teams have gone on to found start-up business ventures, though they may be reluctant to reveal their earlier exploits until many years have passed.{{citation needed|date= April 2011}}

==Famous hacks==
One classic hack involved a police car with its flashing warning lights operating. The unusual aspect of this hack was its position — on top of MIT's Great Dome. The car was found to be a gutted, junked, heavy Chevrolet, painted meticulously to match the MIT Campus Police patrol cars. The car's number was [[pi]].  Its license plate read "[[#IHTFP|IHTFP]]", the abbreviation for MIT's unofficial slogan.  A dummy dressed as a campus patrolman was seated inside with mug of coffee and a box of donuts.&lt;ref name=CP-Car&gt;{{cite web|title=CP Car on the Great Dome|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1994/cp_car/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some years later, the police car has now been semi-permanently re-installed in the [[Ray and Maria Stata Center|Stata Center]] as an all-time classic.&lt;ref name="StataHacks"/&gt;

Due to MIT's proximity to Harvard, many hacks involve the annual [[Harvard–Yale football rivalry|Harvard-Yale]] [[American football|football]] game.  Because of the Cambridge rivalry between MIT and Harvard, hackers often are found at the games, and they have come up with some of the most famous hacks in the Institute's history.&lt;ref name=HackHarvardWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Hacks on Harvard|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_topic/harvard.html|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HackHarvardBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.

One such notable hack attempt targeting the 1948 Harvard-Yale football game&lt;ref name=HackHarvardBook1948&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork : a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|page=172|chapter=When MIT won the Harvard-Yale game: hacking Harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved the use of [[detonating cord|primer cord]].  One night shortly before the game MIT students snuck into the Harvard stadium and buried primer cord just under the field.  The plan was to burn the letters MIT into the middle of the field during the game.  However, their work was uncovered by groundskeepers and disabled.  During the game the hackers were apprehended while wearing heavy coats on a fair-weather day.  The coats were lined with batteries, obviously intended to be used to detonate the primer cord.  An apocryphal story is that an MIT dean came to their defense, opening his own battery-lined coat and claiming that "all Tech men carry batteries"; an MIT dean did show up, but he was not wearing batteries.  This phrase has since become common among MIT students.

The Harvard-Yale football game was again the target of MIT hackers in 1982&lt;ref name=HackHarvardBook1982&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork : a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=172–176|chapter=When MIT won the Harvard-Yale game: hacking Harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a large weather balloon painted with "MIT" all around was inflated, seemingly from nowhere, in the middle of the field.  The next day the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' ran the headline "MIT 1—Harvard-Yale 0: Tech Pranksters Steal the Show".  The 1982 Harvard-Yale hack earned acclaim as winner of "Hack Madness", a [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|March Madness]]-themed contest sponsored by the MIT Alumni Association in 2014 to determine "the greatest MIT hack of all time".&lt;ref name=HackMadness&gt;{{cite web|title=The Harvard-Yale Football Game is MIT Hack Madness Champion|url=https://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/2014/03/14/hack-champion/|year=2014|publisher=Slice of MIT|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 an MIT banner was successfully launched from an end zone using a model rocket engine shortly before Yale attempted a field goal kick.&lt;ref name=HarvardYale1990&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard-Yale Game Banner|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1990/H-Y/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996, the Harvard logos on the scoreboard were hacked from ''VE-RI-TAS'' to read ''HU-GE-EGO'' instead.&lt;ref name=HY-Ego&gt;{{cite web|title="Huge Ego" at Harvard-Yale game|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2006/H_Y_huge_ego/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another traditional hacking target has been the bronze [[John Harvard (statue)|statue of John Harvard]],&lt;ref name=HackJohnHarvardBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork: a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=181–183|chapter=When MIT won the Harvard-Yale game: hacking Harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt; the namesake of [[Harvard University]].  The statue itself was sculpted by [[Daniel Chester French]], a respected artist who studied at MIT, who is best known for his statue of ''[[Abraham Lincoln (1920 statue)|Abraham Lincoln]]'' at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in [[Washington DC]].  Because of its visible location in [[Harvard Yard]] and its symbolic significance, the John Harvard statue has been fitted with an unending sequence of "[[fashion accessory|accessories]]".  MIT hackers are hardly alone; [[Dartmouth College]] pranksters like to paint the statue green, [[Yale]] pranksters prefer blue, and others have dressed the statue in women's underwear.  MIT hackers like to go a few steps further,  fitting the statue with a plaster leg cast after a crushing football defeat,&lt;ref name=HarvardCast&gt;{{cite web|title=Cast on John Harvard|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1990/harvard_cast/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disguising the statue as the [[Unabomber]] after that infamous Harvard alumnus was arrested.&lt;ref name=UnabomberHack&gt;{{cite web|title=Unabomber Suspect Apprehended in Harvard Yard|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1996/unabomber/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Harvard has worn a [[Brass Rat]] from time to time, and has donned a Halo combat helmet and brandished a Halo assault rifle to mark the release of the ''Halo 3'' [[first-person shooter]] video game.&lt;ref name=HarvardHalo3&gt;{{cite web|title=John Harvard plays Halo3|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2007/halo3_john_harvard/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with hacker ethics, great care is taken to ensure that the hacks can be removed without causing permanent damage to Harvard's treasured symbol.&lt;ref name=HackJohnHarvardRingBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.

The cleverness of many MIT hacks has even resulted in [[urban legend]]s about supposed hacks that may not have occurred.  One rumored hack involved a certain student's adherence to [[classical conditioning]] behavior response, as studied by Harvard Professor [[B. F. Skinner]]. Throughout the off-season, this supposed student visited the Harvard football stadium during his lunch break. He dressed in a black and white striped shirt and trousers, filled his pockets with bird-seed, then went on the field, blew a whistle, and spread his birdseed on the field. The result of all of this effort, the story goes, is that on opening day as the Harvard football team took the field to face their opponent, the referee blew his whistle to signal the start of the game, and the field was suddenly inundated by a flock of birds looking for their lunch.  Despite sounding like a classic MIT hack, this particular prank has never been verified.  The author of a 1990 book about pranks pulled by MIT students stated that he had not come across clear documentation of this tale during his years of research.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081216214708/http://www.snopes.com/college/pranks/birdseed.asp Seeded Field Prank]. snopes.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, at least one hack involved a staged event that never occurred, when hackers convinced major news media that they had created an indoor snowstorm in Baker House dormitory.&lt;ref name=BakerSnow&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Baker House Snow Hack|url=http://museum.mit.edu/nom150/entries/1446|website=MIT 150 Exhibition Nominations|publisher=MIT Museum|accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, hackers installed 153 (= 9 x 17) custom-made wirelessly-controlled color-changing high-power [[LED]] lights into every window above the first floor of the 295-foot (90 m) tall MIT [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]]. They displayed a waving [[American flag]] throughout the evening of September 11, 2011 in remembrance of the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001.  For a short time in the early morning of September 12, the lights displayed a [[Tetris]] game, thus realizing a long-standing hack proposal, the "[[Holy Grail]]" of hacks. The display hardware had occasional glitches, and was removed as of September 13. The hardware and software designs were further developed and refined for better reliability. On April 20, 2012, MIT hackers successfully turned the Green Building into a huge playable Tetris game, operated from a wireless control podium at a comfortable viewing distance in front of the building. Visitors to Campus Preview Weekend (a gathering for admitted prospective freshman students) were invited to play the game on the colossal display grid (80&amp;nbsp;ft. wide x 250&amp;nbsp;ft. high), which was claimed to be the second-largest full-color video display in the US.&lt;ref name=Pourian&gt;{{cite news|last=Pourian|first=Jessica J.|title=The 'holy grail' of hacks: The construction of one of the most anticipated hacks of all time|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N22/tetris.html|accessdate=2012-05-06|newspaper=The Tech|date=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Brock|title=Hackers convert MIT building in giant Tetris video game|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/cambridge/2012/04/hackers_convert_mit_building_i.html|accessdate=2012-05-06|newspaper=Boston.com|date=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HackGalleryTetris&gt;{{cite web|title=Tetris on the Green Building|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2012/tetris/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|publisher=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of a one-shot temporary installation, the hackers have designed and built a permanent facility that can be re-used repeatedly by the MIT community. An understanding has been reached with the EAPS Department, which is headquartered in the Green Building, to allow the light display hardware to remain installed in each window.  To avoid annoying the occupants and to allow late-working staff to "opt out", each light display is equipped with a manual override button, which will disable the [[pixel]] lighting for that window for several hours after it is pressed. In addition, the hackers have released [[Open Source]] software tools used to develop new display patterns, so that others can design and deploy new stationary or animated images, in cooperation with the hacker engineers.&lt;ref name="Pourian"/&gt;

==IHTFP==
'''IHTFP'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihtfp.com/ihtfp.html |title=What is IHTFP? |website=Ihtfp.com |accessdate=2012-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an abbreviation which is part of the folklore at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. It originally stood for "I Hate This Fucking Place" but, due to use of profanity, is often [[euphemism|euphemized]] with other [[backronym]]s. Some of the more popular meanings include "I Have The Fucking Power" (Hacking), "I Help Tutor Freshman Physics", "It's Hard To Fondle Penguins", "I'm Hankering To Find Paradise", and "Interesting Hacks To Fascinate People", as well as "I Have Truly Found Paradise", "Institute for Hacks, TomFoolery, and Pranks" and "Institute Has The Finest Professors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mit.edu/people/mjbauer/ihtfp.html |title=IHTFP |website=Mit.edu |accessdate=2012-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIT leadership has even adapted the acronym, using it to encourage vaccination during the 2009–2010 flu season with a banner in the MIT medical building that read "I Hate This Flu Pandemic". The precise time of origin is unknown, though the term IHTFP was already widely used at MIT by 1960.

The letters "IHTFP" have been featured prominently on some hacks,&lt;ref name=IHTFP-Hack&gt;{{cite web|title=I Will Hate This F***ing Place|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2008/iwhtfp/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IHTFP-Balloons&gt;{{cite web|title=IHTFP Balloons|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2003/ihtfp_balloons/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IHTFP-GreatDome&gt;{{cite web|title=MCMXVI changed to IHTFP on Great Dome|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1995/ihtfp_dome/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IHTFP-Flag&gt;{{cite web|title=I Hate The Flag Policy|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2004/flag_policy/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HackIHTFPBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T.

A very common motif in the MIT [[MIT class ring|Brass Rat]] (class ring) prior to 2013 was the inclusion of the letters "IHTFP" hidden somewhere within the frame of the bezel.

The 2016 celebrations of MIT's 'crossing of the Charles' in 1916, featured a translations as 'I Honor Theory (and) Forgo Practice'. This was part of a play / sketch addressing the friction between theoretical and applied researchers.

==Caltech rivalry==
{{main|Caltech–MIT rivalry}}

MIT and [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] have been prank rivals since Spring 2005, when a group of Caltech students traveled to Cambridge to pull a string of pranks during "Campus Preview Weekend" (CPW) for prospective new MIT students.  The stunts included covering up the word "Massachusetts" in the "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" engraving on the main building façade with a banner, so that it read "That Other Institute of Technology". A group of MIT hackers quickly responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read "The Only Institute of Technology".&lt;ref name=HackCaltechBook&gt;
{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Institute Historian T. F.|title=Nightwork: a history of hacks and pranks at MIT (updated edition)|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51584-9|pages=8–13|chapter=Hacking into the new millennium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT students retaliated for CPW in April 2006, when students posing as the [http://www.howeandser.com/ "Howe &amp; Ser Moving Co."] abducted the 130-year-old, 1.7 ton Fleming House Cannon and moved it to their campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, thus reprising a similar prank performed by [[Harvey Mudd College]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=HackCaltechBook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/04/19/comedy_on_campus_mit_takes_on_caltech_for_prank_distinction/ |title=Comedy on Campus: MIT takes on Caltech for prank distinction |date=April 19, 2006 |publisher=Boston Globe |first=Catherine |last=Elton}}&lt;/ref&gt; To add a technical flourish, a [[Carat (purity)|24K]] gold-plated precisely upscaled machined replica of the famed [[Brass Rat]] (MIT's graduation ring) was tightly fitted over the barrel of the cannon, which was carefully aimed in the direction of Caltech.&lt;ref name="CalCannon"/&gt; Twenty-three members of Caltech Fleming House traveled to MIT to reclaim their cannon on April 10, 2006. They were greeted by a larger group of MIT students, who offered them a [[barbecue|BBQ]] farewell party.  In exchange, the Caltech students offered a small toy cannon, saying that this was "more your size".

During MIT's CPW in 2007, Caltech distributed a complete fake edition of ''[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]'' (MIT's student newspaper) with the headline article reading "MIT Invents the Interweb".  Another article announced the discovery, "Infinite Corridor Not Actually Infinite", referring to MIT's [[Infinite Corridor|iconic main thoroughfare]].  The edition included a mock weather forecast, referring often to how sunny [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] (where Caltech is located) is compared to [[Boston]], as well as other satirical articles.&lt;ref name="HackCaltechBook"/&gt;

In 2008, Caltech students provided a "Puzzle Zero" in the [[MIT Mystery Hunt]] which when solved, told solvers to "CALL 1-626-848-3780 ASAP". When MIT students dialed the number, they heard, "Thank you for calling the Caltech Admissions Office. If you are another MIT student wishing to transfer to Caltech, please download our transfer application form from www.caltech.edu. If you are an MIT student not wishing to transfer to Caltech, we wish you the best of luck, and hope you find happiness someday...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Harvey |title=Rub a dub dub, a suspect in a tub; Battle of the brains |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/columnists/la-me-only8-2008jun08,0,6914716.column |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=2008-06-08 |accessdate=2008-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around Thanksgiving weekend in 2009, yet another fake edition of ''The Tech'' was released, alleging that MIT had been sold to Caltech and would become "Caltech East: School of Humanities". Students would be required to take a core of literature, history, philosophy, and economics, but science subjects would be eliminated.&lt;ref name="HackCaltechBook"/&gt;

In the past few years, MIT hackers have tended to ignore Caltech "nuisance" pranks, instead preferring to perform more imaginatively engineered hacks on their own home campus.   In particular, the majority of documented hacks occurring during CPW have been perpetrated by MIT students themselves.&lt;ref name=CreativePeople&gt;{{cite web|title="Creative People with Words" items appear around campus|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2009/creative_people_with_words/|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Annual&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Event Hacks [CPW]|url=http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_topic/timing-dependent.html|website=MIT IHTFP Hack Gallery|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
MIT hackers have only rarely interfered with Caltech traditions, rituals, or celebrations.  But some MIT hackers do occasionally engage in low-level "sniping" back and forth with Caltech pranksters.  For example, hackers made a website http://www.mitrejects.com redirect to Caltech's homepage.  Caltech then did the same, with https://web.archive.org/web/20110614193503/http://www.caltechrejects.com/ redirecting to the MIT homepage.

A possible change in attitude started when a [[TARDIS]], which hackers had placed on the MIT Little Dome (August 25, 2010) and the MIT Great Dome (August 30, 2010), was transported to the roof of Baxter Hall at Caltech (January 4, 2011) by MIT and Caltech pranksters, where it remained for several weeks.  The traveling time-machine subsequently reappeared atop Birge Hall at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (January 29, 2011), and then rematerialized on the Durand Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering Building at [[Stanford University]] (March 18, 2011).  The TARDIS came complete with a helpful note explaining how to disassemble it, and suggesting passing it on to other unexplored destinations.&lt;ref name=MIT-TARDIS&gt;

More-complete coverage, especially of older hacks, appears in the books listed under [[#Further reading|Further Reading]] below, but these printed volumes appear only intermittently. The listing here only summarizes a few salient examples from MIT's long tradition of hacking.

===2017===

In the early morning of April 26, 2017, recent graduate Nicholas William Paggi died while hacking the Great Dome.  According to the MIT newspaper, The Tech, the brilliant computer scientist slipped and fell to his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thetech.com/2017/04/27/nicholas-paggi |title=MIT graduate and 'brilliant programmer' dies on campus |accessdate=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013===

;April 1, 1998: As an [[April Fools' Day|April Fool's Day]] prank, the MIT home page was replaced with a page announcing the university had been bought by [[The Walt Disney Company]] for [[United States dollar|$]]6.9 billion. The hacked page showed a picture of [[Mickey Mouse]] ears atop the Great Dome, and replaced the letter I in MIT with the lower-case "i" from Disney's [[wordmark]].

;May 9, 1994: A carefully assembled outer frame of a car painted as an MIT Campus Police car appeared on top of the Great Dome. This hack quickly gained recognition on many local news sources and on national television.&lt;ref name="CP-Car"/&gt;
;December 9, 1991: It has been often said that "Getting an Education from MIT is like taking a drink from a Fire Hose", inspiring hackers to connect a real fire hose and a concrete-embedded [[fire hydrant]] to a drinking fountain in Building 16. Years later, the iconic monument has been semi-permanently re-installed by the MIT Museum in the [[Ray and Maria Stata Center|Stata Center]].&lt;ref name=FireHoseHack&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire Hose Drinking Fountain

;October 31, 1979: A lifesize fiberglass cow appeared on top of the Great Dome. The cow was later installed by the MIT Museum in the [[Ray and Maria Stata Center|Stata Center]].
;November 1963: The first ever reference to malicious [[security hacker|hacking]] is '[[phreaking|telephone hackers]]' in MIT's student newspaper, ''The Tech'' of hackers trying up the lines with [[Harvard University|Harvard]], configuring the [[PDP-1]] to make free calls, [[war dialing]] and accumulating large phone bills.&lt;ref&gt;https://infostory.com/2011/11/20/hacking-and-blue-boxes/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/first-recorded-usage-of-hacker/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tech.mit.edu/V83/PDF/V83-N24.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
;October 1958: [[Oliver R. Smoot]], a pledge of MIT's [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity in 1958, was used to measure the length of the [[Harvard Bridge]]. As he lay on the sidewalk of the bridge that carries Massachusetts Avenue across the [[Charles River]], markings were made at intervals corresponding to his height. The bridge was measured to be 364.4 [[Smoot]]s (plus or minus one ear) in length.  During renovation of the bridge in 1964 the markings were carefully restored, and the markings remain to this day.

'''Hit Song Science''' is a term coined by [[Mike McCready (music entrepreneur)|Mike McCready]] and trademarked by the company he co-founded, [[Polyphonic HMI]]. It concerns the possibility of predicting whether a song will be a hit, prior to its distribution using automated means such as [[machine learning]] software.

==Scientific background==
The scientific nature of Hit Song Science is a subject of debate in the [[music information retrieval]] (MIR) community. Early studies claimed that using [[machine learning]] techniques could capture some information from audio signals and lyrics that would explain&lt;ref&gt;Dhanaraj, R. and Logan, B. Automatic Prediction of Hit Songs, Proc. of Ismir 2005, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; popularity. 
However, a larger-scale evaluation&lt;ref&gt;Pachet, F. and Roy, P. (2008) [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2008/pachet-08c.pdf Hit Song Science is Not Yet a Science]. Proceedings of Ismir 2008, pages 355-360, Philadelphia, USA&lt;/ref&gt; contradicts the claims of “Hit Song Science”, i.e. that the popularity of a music title can be learned effectively from known audio features. 
Many other reasons, including the well known "cumulative advantage" or [[preferential attachment]] effects deeply contradicts&lt;ref&gt;Pachet, F. (2011) Hit Song Science.

==Commercial applications==
A technology proposing to exploit Hit Song Science was introduced in 2003 by an artificial intelligence company out of Barcelona, Spain, called [[Polyphonic HMI]]. Polyphonic HMI has since spun off a new Delaware C corporation, Music Intelligence Solutions, Inc., which used to run uPlaya, a site geared toward music professionals. In 2006 however one of the company's founders, [[Mike McCready (music entrepreneur)|Mike McCready]] left to pursue another direction in the digital music space.
The idea of Hit Song Science has generated response from many in the music industry, including [[Chuck D]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=51928 XXLmag.com: Chuck D and uPlaya Analyze Hit Songs]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Lamm]], [[Stratton Leopold]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/modules/news/tools.php?tool=print&amp;id=1189500 Stratton Leopold to Advisory Board]&lt;/ref&gt; Gregg Scholl of [[The Orchard (music label)|The Orchard]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2009/06/uplaya-cuts-multitiered-alliance-with-the-orchard.html Music Intelligence Solutions Partners with The Orchard]&lt;/ref&gt; and officials at The Sync Agency&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS55195+16-Jun-2008+MW20080616 Music Intelligence Solutions Partners with The Sync Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Blue Infinity Music. Prior to McCready's departure, Hit Song Science was profiled by [[NBC]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6jg70weJWs NBC Network News Feature on uPlaya]&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFuA0MqP8kA BBC News Report]&lt;/ref&gt; and various major news outlets. The plot line of an episode of "[[Numb3rs]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJL88mBif6U Episode of "Numb3rs" Inspired by Hit Song Science]&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by the technology.
Music Intelligence Solutions, Inc., is using Hit Song Science as a basis for several contests done in partnership with organizations such as [[AllHipHop.com]], [[Urban Latino]] and ''American Songwriter'' magazine, and claims to have predicted the commercial success of [[Norah Jones]]'s debut album, ''[[Come Away with Me]]'', (which won a Grammy for Best Album) and Ben Novak's debut single, "[[Turn Your Car Around]]", which reached the number 12 spot in the UK Top 40 charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uplaya.com/about_hss/hssquotes Ben Novak's debut single enters the UK Top 40 chart at number 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar technologies are now emerging with companies such as [[Mixcloud]], [http://www.musicxray.com MusicXray], and [http://bandmetrics.com/ BandMetrics] who are using their technologies. Mixcloud is working with Queen Mary Technologies.

In [[theatre]], '''house management''' concerns the selling of [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]]s, the [[wiktionary:usher|usher]]ing of [[patron]]s in [[FOH (theatre)|front of house]] areas, and the maintenance and management of the [[Theater (structure)|theatre building]]. House management staff usually work for the theatre, under the supervision of the ''house manager'', and not for the theatrical [[wiktionary:troupe|troupe]] which is occupying it. Often in regional or smaller theatres the responsibility falls under the aegis of the ''production manager''. In any case, house management works closely with the [[production management]] team for the presentation of the theatrical production.

In domestic services, "house management" refers to the overseeing of employees that make up the staff of the household, including drivers, nannies, and housekeepers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2446">'''Kuba Divination''' is a form of [[divination]] used by the [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] people of central Africa.

Kuba divination is practiced by specialists called ''ngwoom''. According to historian John Mack, divination is used to gain access to the knowledge which only the spirits, called ''[[ngesh]]'', possess about the source of social and physical ills which may affect a community. It serves two main purposes: detection of thieves, and determining the cause of illness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mack, John. "Animal Representations in Kuba Art: An Anthropological Interpretation of Sculpture" in ''Oxford Art Journal'', Vol. 4, No. 2, Sculpture (Nov., 1981), pp. 50-56Published by: Oxford University PressArticle Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1360140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ngwoom==
[[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] diviners (''ngwoom'') maintain the proper relationship between ''[[ngesh]]'' and humans. Even with the establishment of [[Christian church]] congregations in many Kuba communities during the 20th Century, ''ngwoom'' and other specialists whose expertise derives from ''ngesh'' continue to practice.&lt;ref name="Binkley 2009" /&gt;

==Itoom==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.812 Diviners Instrument Itoom (3).jpg|thumbnail|Kuba itoom, divining discs missing, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
Rubbing oracles (''itoom'') were used by Kuba ''ngwoom'' during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth centuries. This practice was adopted from the related [[Kete language|Kete]] and employed extensively by the Kuba.

''Itoom'' all functioned in the same manner: a small wooden disc with a smooth base and a projecting knob was rubbed across the surface of the ''itoom'' by the ''ngwoom'' while he or she uttered a series of names or formulas. When the moving disk abruptly stopped, the desired information was disclosed.

Most ''itoom'' were created in the form of a naturalistic or abstract representation of an animal. The most common animals represented, such as the crocodile, warthog, lizard, and dog, were associated with the forest and surrounding natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Binkley 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Binkley|first=David A|title=Kuba|year=2009|publisher=5 Continents Edition|location=Milan|author2=Patricia Darish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Burne-Jones.The last sleep of Arthur.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon]]'' (begun 1881), detail, by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] (d. 1898), greatly influenced by ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' throughout his career]]

'''''{{lang|frm|Le Morte d'Arthur}}''''' (originally spelled '''''{{lang|frm|Le Morte Darthur}}''''', [[Middle French]] for "The Death of Arthur"&lt;ref&gt;Since ''morte'' (or ''mort'') is a feminine noun, French would require the article ''la'' (i.e., "la mort d'Arthur"). According to Stephen H. A. Shepherd, "Malory frequently misapplies ''le'' in titular compounds, perhaps on a simple sonic and gender-neutral analogy with 'the'". Stephen H. A. Shepherd, ed., ''Le Morte Darthur'', by Sir Thomas Malory (New York: W. W. Norton, 2004), 1n.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a reworking by Sir [[Thomas Malory]] of existing tales about the legendary [[King Arthur]], [[Guinevere]], [[Lancelot]], [[Merlin]], and the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Malory interpreted existing French and English stories about these figures and adds original material (e.g., the [[Gareth]] story). Malory's actual title for the work was '''''The Whole Book of King Arthur and His Noble Knights of the Round Table''''', but after Malory's death the publisher changed the title to what is commonly known today. "The Death of Arthur" originally only referred to the final volume in the complete work.

''Le Morte d'Arthur'' was first published in 1485 by [[William Caxton]] and is today one of the best-known works of [[Arthurian literature]] in English. Until the discovery of the [[Winchester Manuscript]] in 1934, the 1485 edition was considered the earliest known text of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' and that closest to Malory's translation and compilation.&lt;ref name="Bryan vii"&gt;Bryan, Elizabeth J. (1994/1999). "Sir Thomas Malory", ''Le Morte D'Arthur'', p.vii. Modern Library. New York. {{ISBN|0-679-60099-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Various modern editions are inevitably variable, changing a variety of spelling, grammar, and/or pronouns for the convenience of readers of modern English. Many modern Arthurian writers have used Malory as their principal source.

==Authorship==
{{main|Sir Thomas Malory}}

The exact identity of the author of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' has long been the subject of speculation, owing to the fact that at least six historical figures bore the name of "Sir Thomas Malory" in the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Bryan|1994/1999|p=v}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the work the author describes himself as "Knyght presoner Thomas Malleorre" ("Sir Thomas Maleore" according to the publisher [[William Caxton]]). This is taken as supporting evidence for the identification most widely accepted by scholars: that the author was the Thomas Malory born in the year 1416, to Sir John Malory of [[Newbold Revel]], [[Warwickshire]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wight|first1=Colin|title=Thomas Malory's 'Le Morte Darthur'|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/englit/malory/|website=www.bl.uk|language=en|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Whitteridge|2009|pp=257–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Thomas inherited the family estate in 1434, but by 1450 he was fully engaged in a life of crime. As early as 1433 he had been accused of theft, but the more serious allegations against him were that of the attempted murder of [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], an accusation of at least two rapes, and that he had attacked and robbed [[Coombe Abbey]]. Malory was first arrested and imprisoned in 1451 for the ambush of Buckingham, but was released early in 1452. By March he was back in the [[Marshalsea]] prison and then in [[Colchester]], escaping on at least two occasions. In 1461 he was granted a pardon by [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], returning to live at his estate.

Although originally allied to the [[House of York]], after his release Malory changed his allegiance to the [[House of Lancaster]]. This led to him being imprisoned yet again in 1468 when he led an ill-fated plot to overthrow [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It was during this final stint at [[Newgate Prison]] in London that he is believed to have written ''Le Morte d'Arthur''. Malory was released in October, 1470 when Henry VI came to the throne, but died only five months later.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Publication history==
Elizabeth Bryan speaks of Malory's contribution to Arthurian legend in her introduction to ''Le Morte d'Arthur'': "Malory did not invent the stories in this collection; he translated and compiled them... Malory in fact translated Arthurian stories that already existed in thirteenth-century French prose (the so-called [[Old French]] [[Vulgate Cycle|Vulgate romances]]) and compiled them together with at least one tale from [[Middle English]] sources (the [[Alliterative Morte Arthure|Alliterative ''Morte Arthure'']] and the [[Stanzaic Morte Arthur|Stanzaic ''Morte Arthur'']]) to create this text."&lt;ref name="Bryan viii"&gt;Bryan (1994), p.viii-ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malory called the full work ''The Hoole Book of Kyng Arthur and of His Noble Knyghtes of The Rounde Table'', but William Caxton instead titled it with Malory's name for the final section of the cycle. Modernized editions update the late Middle English spelling, update some pronouns, and re-punctuate and re-paragraph the text. Others furthermore update the phrasing and vocabulary to contemporary [[Modern English]]. Here is an example (from Caxton's preface) in Middle English and then in Modern English:

:Doo after the good and leve the evyl, and it shal brynge you to good fame and renomme.&lt;ref name="Bryan xii"&gt;Bryan (1994), p.xii.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Do after the good and leave the evil, and it shall bring you to good fame and renown.&lt;ref name="Bryan xviii"&gt;Bryan, ed. (1999), p.xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Middle English of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' is much closer to [[Early Modern English]] than the Middle English of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. If the spelling is modernized, it reads almost like Elizabethan English.

The first printing of Malory's work was made by Caxton in 1485. Only two copies of this original printing are known to exist, in the collections of the [[Morgan Library &amp; Museum]] in New York and the [[John Rylands Library]] in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/malorybooklet/malory.htm | title=Malory's Morte d'Arthur | publisher=The Rossell Hope Robbins Library at the University of Rochester | year=2010 | accessdate=3 July 2013 | author=McShane, Kara L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proved popular and was reprinted in 1498 and 1529 with some additions and changes by [[Wynkyn de Worde]] who succeeded Caxton's press. Three more editions were published before the [[English Civil War]]: William Copland's (1557), [[Thomas East]]'s (1585), and [[William Stansby]]'s (1634), each of which contained additional changes and errors (including the omission of an entire leaf). Thereafter, the book went out of fashion until the [[romanticism|Romantic]] revival of interest in all things [[medieval]]; the year 1816 saw a new edition by Walker and Edwards, and another one by Wilks, both based on the 1634 Stansby edition. Davison's 1817 edition was promoted by [[Robert Southey]] and was based on Caxton's 1485 edition or on a mixture of Caxton and Stansby. Davison was the basis for subsequent editions until the discovery of the Winchester Manuscript.

Caxton separated Malory's eight books into 21 books; subdivided each book into a total of 507 chapters; added a summary of each chapter and added a [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] to the entire book.&lt;ref name="Bryan ix"&gt;Bryan (2004), p.ix&lt;/ref&gt; Malory's eight tales are:
#The birth and rise of Arthur: "From the Marriage of King Uther unto King Arthur that Reigned After Him and Did Many Battles"
#[[King Arthur]]'s war against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]: "The Noble Tale Between King Arthur and Lucius the Emperor of Rome"
#The book of [[Lancelot]]: "The Tale of Sir Launcelot du Lac"
#The book of [[Gareth]] (brother of [[Gawain]]): "The Tale of Sir Gareth"
#[[Tristan]] and [[Isolde]]: "The Book of Sir Tristrams de Lyons"
#The Quest for the [[Holy Grail]]: "The Noble Tale of the Sangreal"
#The affair between [[Lancelot]] and [[Guinevere]]: "Sir Launcelot and Queen Gwynevere"
#The breaking of the [[Knights of the Round Table]] and the death of Arthur: "Le Morte d'Arthur"

Most of the events in the book take place in [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]] and France at an unspecified time. (The historical events on which the legend is based took place in the late 5th century, but the story contains many [[anachronism]]s and makes no effort at historical accuracy.) In some parts, the story ventures farther afield, to [[Rome]] and [[Sarras]] (near [[Babylon]]), and recalls [[Bible|Biblical]] tales from the [[ancient Near East]].

===The Winchester Manuscript===
{{for|the Winchester Chronicle|Anglo-Saxon Chronicle}}

[[Winchester College]] headmaster [[Walter Fraser Oakeshott|W. F. Oakeshott]] discovered a previously unknown [[manuscript]] copy of the work in June 1934, during the cataloging of the college's library. Newspaper accounts announced that what Caxton had published in 1485 was not exactly what Malory had written.&lt;ref name="manuscript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://virtual.park.uga.edu/~jdmevans/public/september.html |title=The Text of Malory |author=W. F. Oakeshott |accessdate=2009-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703210455/http://virtual.park.uga.edu/~jdmevans/public/september.html |archivedate=2008-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oakeshott published "The Finding of the Manuscript" in 1963, chronicling the initial event and his realization that "this indeed was Malory," with "startling evidence of revision" in the Caxton edition.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Walter F. Oakeshott, "The Finding of the Manuscript," ''Essays on Malory'', ed. J. A. W. Bennett (Oxford: Clarendon, 1963), 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that Caxton's text and the Winchester manuscript are both derived from an earlier copy. (Having said this, microscopic examination revealed that ink smudges on the Winchester manuscript are offsets of newly printed pages set in Caxton's own font, which indicates that the Winchester Manuscript was in Caxton's print shop. The "Winchester Manuscript" is believed to be closer on the whole to Malory's original. In addition, it does not have the book and chapter divisions for which Caxton takes credit in his preface.

Malory scholar [[Eugène Vinaver]] examined the manuscript shortly after its discovery. Oakeshott was encouraged to produce an edition himself, but he ceded the project to Vinaver.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; Based on his initial study of the manuscript, Oakeshott concluded in 1935 that the copy from which Caxton printed his edition "was already subdivided into books and sections."&lt;ref&gt;Walter F. Oakeshott, "Caxton and Malory's Morte Darthur," ''[[Gutenberg-Jahrbuch]]'' (1935), 112-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Vinaver made an exhaustive comparison of the manuscript with Caxton's edition and reached similar conclusions. In his 1947 publication of ''The Works of Sir Thomas Malory'', he argued that Malory did not write a single book, but rather a series of Arthurian tales, each of which is an internally consistent and independent work. However, scholars (including William Matthews) pointed out that Malory's later tales make frequent references back to the earlier events, suggesting that he had wanted the tales to cohere better but had not sufficiently revised the whole text to achieve this.&lt;ref&gt;William Matthews, ''The Ill-Framed Knight: A Skeptical Inquiry into the Identity of Sir Thomas Malory'' (Berkeley, CA: University of California, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Winchester manuscript has been digitised by a Japanese team, who note that "the text is imperfect, as the manuscript lacks the first and last quires and few leaves. The most striking feature of the manuscript is the [[Rubrication|extensive use of red ink]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maloryproject.com/winchester_more.php The Malory Project (http://www.maloryproject.com)], directed by Takako Kato and designed by Nick Hayward.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whetter|first1=K. S.|title=The Manuscript and Meaning of Malory's Morte Darthur|date=2017|publisher=D. S. Brewer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style and themes===
The publication of Chaucer's work by William Caxton was a precursor to his publication of Malory's ''Le Morte d'Arthur''. Where the ''Canterbury Tales'' are in Middle English, Malory extends "one hand to Chaucer, and one to [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]" constructing a manuscript which is hard to place in one category. Like other English prose in the 15th century, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' was highly influenced by French writings, but Malory blends these with other English verse and prose forms. Although Malory hearkens back to an age of idealized knighthood, jousting tournaments, and grand castles to suggest a medieval world, his stories lack any agricultural life, or commerce which makes the story feel as if it were an era of its own.

Because there is so much lengthy ground to cover, Malory uses "so—and—then," often to transition his retelling. This repetition is not redundant, but adds an air of continuity only befitting the story's scale and grandeur. The stories then become episodes instead of instances that can stand on their own.

There is an artful way in which Malory portrays Arthur by revealing him to the readers only by how others are affected by his actions. This creates a man whom we cannot define, but still stands as the center of the legend, and lets our mind move from him to the scenes around him.&lt;ref&gt;"Morte d'Arthur." The Cambridge History of English Literature. A.W Ward, A.R Waller. Vol II. Cambridge: A UP, 1933. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The forms of romantic characters used in order to create the world of Arthur and the Round Table, "consist almost entirely of fighting men, their wives or mistresses, with an occasional clerk or an enchanter, a fairy or a fiend, a giant or a dwarf," and "time does not work on the heroes of Malory."&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Kilvert, Ian. ''British Writers''. Charles Scribners's Sons, New York 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
===Book I: "From the Marriage of King Uther unto King Arthur that Reigned After Him and Did Many Battles" (Caxton I–IV)===
[[King Arthur|Arthur]] is born to [[Uther Pendragon]] and [[Igraine]] and then taken by [[Sir Ector]] to be fostered in the country. He later becomes the king of a leaderless Britain when he removes the fated sword from the stone. Arthur goes on to win many battles due to his military prowess and [[Merlin]]'s counsel. He then consolidates his kingdom.

This first book also tells "The Tale of [[Sir Balin|Balyn]] and [[Sir Balan|Balan]]", which ends in accidental fratricide, and the begetting of [[Mordred]], Arthur's incestuous son by his half-sister, [[Morgause]] (though Arthur did not know her as his half-sister). On Merlin's advice, and reminiscent of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], Arthur takes every newborn boy in his kingdom and sends them to sea in a boat. The boat crashes and all but Mordred, who later kills his father, perish (this is mentioned matter-of-fact, with no apparent moral overtone). Arthur marries [[Guinevere]], and inherits the [[Round Table]] from her father [[Leodegrance]]. At [[Pentecost]], Arthur gathers his knights at [[Camelot]] and establishes the Round Table company. All swear to the [[Pentecostal Oath]] as a guide for knightly conduct.

===Book II: "The Noble Tale Between King Arthur and Lucius the Emperor of Rome" (Caxton V)===
This book, detailing Arthur's march on [[Rome]], is heavily based on the Middle English [[Alliterative Morte Arthure|Alliterative ''Morte Arthure'']], which in turn is heavily based on [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''. The opening of Book V finds Arthur and his kingdom without an enemy. His throne is secure, his knights have proven themselves through a series of quests, Sir [[Lancelot]] and Sir [[Tristan]] have arrived and the court is feasting. When envoys from [[Lucius Tiberius|Emperor Lucius]] of Rome arrive and accuse Arthur of refusing tribute, "contrary to the statutes and decrees made by the noble and worthy [[Julius Caesar]]", Arthur and his knights are stirring for a fight. They are "many days rested" and excited, "for now shall we have warre and worshype." Arthur invokes the lineage of Ser [[Belinus|Belyne]] and Sir [[Brennius|Bryne]], legendary British conquerors of Rome, and through their blood lineage demands tribute from Lucius under the argument that Britain conquered Rome first. Lucius, apprised of the situation by his envoys, raises a heathen army of the East, composed of [[Spain|Spaniards]] and [[Saracen]]s, as well as other enemies of the Christian world. Rome is supposed to be the seat of Christianity, but it is more foreign and corrupt than the courts of Arthur and his allies. 

Departing from Geoffrey of Monmouth's history in which Mordred is left in charge, Malory's Arthur leaves his court in the hands of Sir [[Constantine III of Britain|Constantine]] of Cornwall and an advisor. Arthur sails to [[Normandy]] to meet his cousin [[Hoel]], but he finds a giant terrorizing the people from the holy island of [[Mont Saint-Michel|Mont St. Michel]]. Arthur battles him alone, an act of public relations intended to inspire his knights. The giant dies after Arthur "swappis his genytrottys in sondir" and "kut his baly in sundir, that oute wente the gore." Arthur then fights Lucius and his armies defeat the Romans. He is crowned Emperor, a proxy government is arranged for the Roman Empire and Arthur returns to London where his queen welcomes him royally.

===Book III: "The Noble Tale of Sir Launcelot Du Lac" (Caxton VI)===
In this tale, Malory establishes Lancelot as King Arthur's most revered knight. Among Lancelot's numerous episodic adventures include being enchanted into a deep sleep by the four sorceresses including [[Morgan le Fay]] and [[Sebile]] and having to escape from their castle, proving victorious in a tournament fighting on behalf of King [[Bagdemagus]], slaying the mighty Sir Turquine who had been holding several of Arthur's knights prisoner, and also overcoming the betrayal of a damsel to defend himself unarmed against Sir Phelot.

===Book IV: "The Tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney" (Caxton VII)===
The tale of Sir [[Gareth]] begins with his arrival at court as ''[[le bel inconnu]]'', or the fair unknown. He comes without a name and therefore without a past. [[Sir Kay]] mockingly calls the unknown young man "Beaumains" and treats him with contempt and condescension. An unknown woman, later revealed to be the Dame [[Lynette and Lyonesse|Lynette]], eventually comes to court asking for assistance against the [[Red Knight]] of the Red Lands, and Gareth takes up the quest. On his quest, he encounters the [[Black knight|Black]], [[Green Knight|Green]], [[Red Knight|Red]], and Blue knights and the Red knight of the Red Lands. He kills the Black Knight, incorporates the others into Arthur's court, and rescues Lynette's sister [[Lynette and Lyonesse|Lyonesse]]. Lustily in love with Lyonesse, Gareth conspires to consummate their relationship before marrying. Only by the magical intervention of Lynette is their tryst unsuccessful, thus preserving Gareth's virginity and, presumably, his standing with God. Gareth later counsels Lyonesse to report to King Arthur and pretend she doesn't know where he is; instead, he tells her to announce a tournament of his knights against the Round Table. This allows Gareth to disguise himself and win honor by defeating his brother knights. The heralds eventually acknowledge that he is Sir Gareth right as he strikes down Sir [[Gawain]], his brother. The book ends with Gareth rejoining his fellow knights and marrying Lyonesse.

In Book IV, there are only two knights that have ever held against Sir Lancelot in tournament: Tristan and Gareth. This was always under conditions where one or both parties were unknown by the other, for these knights loved each other "passingly well." Gareth was knighted by Lancelot himself when he took upon him the adventure on behalf of Dame Lynette. Much later, Gareth is accidentally slain by his beloved Lancelot when Guinevere is rescued from being burnt at the stake by King Arthur.

===Book V: "The First and the Second Book of Sir Tristrams de Lione" (Caxton VIII–XII)===
In "The Fyrste and the Secunde Boke of Syr Trystrams de Lyones", Malory tells the tales of Sir Tristan (Trystram), Sir [[Dinadan]], Sir [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Palamedes]], Sir [[Sir Breunor|La Cote de Male Tayle]], Sir Alexander, and a variety of other knights. Based on the French [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']], or a lost English adaptation of it, Malory's Tristan section is the literal centerpiece of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' as well as the longest of the eight books.

The book is rife with adultery, characterized most visibly in Sir Tristan and the Belle [[Iseult|Isolde]]. However, it should be noted that Sir Tristan had met and fallen in love with Isolde earlier, and that his uncle, King Mark, jealous of Tristan and seeking to undermine him, appears to seek marriage to Isolde for just such a hateful purpose, going so far as to ask Tristan to go and seek her hand on his behalf (which Tristan, understanding that to be his knightly duty, does). Sir Tristan is the namesake of the book and his adulterous relationship with Isolde, his uncle [[Mark of Cornwall|King Mark]]'s wife, is one of the focuses of the section. Other knights, even knights of the Round Table, make requests that show the dark side of the world of chivalry. In one episode, Sir Bleoberis, one of Lancelot's cousins, claims another knight's wife for his own and rides away with her until stopped by Sir Tristan. In another, when Tristan defeats Sir Blamore, another knight of the Round Table, Blamore asks Tristan to kill him because he would rather die than have his reputation tarnished by the defeat.

Of all the knights, Tristan most resembles Lancelot. He loves a queen, the wife of another. Tristan is even considered to be as strong and able a knight as Lancelot, although they become beloved friends. Because of King Mark's treacherous behavior, Tristan takes Isolde from him and lives with her for some time, but he then returns Isolde to him. Nonetheless, Mark kills Tristan while he is "harping" (Tristan is noted in the book as one of the greatest of musicians and falconers).

===Book VI: "The Noble Tale of the Sangreal" (Caxton XIII–XVII)===
Malory's primary source for "The Noble Tale of the Sangreal" is the French [[Vulgate Cycle]]'s ''La Queste Del Saint Graal''. Malory's version chronicles the adventures of numerous knights in their quest to achieve the [[Holy Grail]]. The Grail first appears in the hall of King Arthur "{{H:title|covered|coverde}} with {{H:title|white|whyght}} [[samite|samyte]]," and it miraculously produces meat and drink for the knights. Gawain is the first to declare that he "shall laboure in the Queste of the Sankgreall." He embarks on the quest in order to see the Grail "more opynly than hit hath bene shewed" before, and to gain more "metys and drynkes." Likewise, Lancelot, [[Percival]], [[Bors]], and [[Galahad]] undergo the quest. Their exploits are intermingled with encounters with maidens and hermits who offer advice and interpret dreams along the way.

===Book VII: "Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere" (Caxton XVIII–XIX)===
At the beginning of the book "Sir Launcelot and Queene Gwenyvere", Malory tells his readers that the pair started behaving carelessly in public, stating that "Launcelot began to resort unto the Queene Guinevere again and forget the promise and the perfection that he made in the Quest... and so they loved together more hotter than they did beforehand." They indulged in "privy draughts together" and behaved in such a way that "many in the court spoke of it" (Cooper, 402).

This book also includes the "knight of the cart" episode, where [[Maleagant]] kidnapped Guinevere and her unarmed knights and held them prisoner in his castle. After Maleagant's archers killed his horse, Lancelot had to ride to the castle in a cart in order to save the queen. Knowing Lancelot was on his way, Maleagant pleaded to Guinevere for mercy, which she granted and then forced Lancelot to stifle his rage against Maleagant.

In this same book Malory mentions Lancelot and Guinevere's adultery. Malory says, "So, to passe upon this tale, Sir Launcelot wente to bedde with the Quene and toke no force of his hurte honed, but toke his plesaunce and hys lyknge untyll hit was the dawning of the day" (Cooper, 633). Sir Maleagant, upon finding blood in Guinevere's bed, was so convinced of her unfaithfulness to Arthur that he was willing to fight in an attempt to prove it to others. After Guinevere made it known that she wanted Maleagant dead, Lancelot killed him even though Maleagant begged for mercy (but only after Maleagant agreed to continue fighting with Lancelot's helmet removed, his left side body armor removed, and his left hand tied behind his back—Lancelot felt it necessary to finish the bout, but would not slay Maleagant unless Maleagant agreed to continue fighting). The book ends with Lancelot's healing of Sir Urry of Hungary, where Malory notes that Lancelot is the only knight out of hundreds to succeed in this endeavor.

===Book VIII: "The Death of Arthur" (Caxton XX–XXI)===
Mordred and [[Agravaine]] have been scheming to uncover Lancelot and Guinevere's adultery for quite some time. When they find an opportune moment to finally and concretely reveal the adulterous relationship, Lancelot kills Agravaine and several others and escapes. Arthur is forced to sentence Guinevere to burn at the stake, and orders his surviving nephews, Gawain, Mordred, Gareth, and [[Gaheris]], to guard the scene, knowing Lancelot will attempt a rescue. Gawain flatly refuses to be part of any act that will treat the queen shamefully. His younger brothers, Gaheris and Gareth, unable to deny the king's request that they escort Guinevere to the stake to be burnt, advise that they will do so at his command, but they will not arm themselves. When Lancelot's party raids the execution, many knights are killed, including, by accident, Gareth and Gaheris. Gawain, bent on revenge for their deaths, prompts Arthur into a war with Lancelot, first at his castle in northern Britain. At this point the Pope steps in and issues a [[papal bull|bull]] to end the violence between Arthur's and Lancelot's factions. Shortly thereafter, Arthur pursues Lancelot to his home in France to continue the fight. Gawain twice challenges Lancelot to a duel, but each time loses and asks Lancelot to kill him; Lancelot refuses and grants him mercy before leaving.

Arthur receives a message that Mordred, whom he had left in charge back in Britain, has usurped his throne, and he leads his forces back home. In the invasion Gawain is mortally injured, and writes to Lancelot, asking for his help against Mordred, and for forgiveness for separating the Round Table. In a dream, the departed Gawain tells Arthur to wait thirty days for Lancelot to return to Britain before fighting Mordred, and Arthur sends [[Sir Lucan|Lucan]] and [[Bedivere]] to make a temporary peace treaty. At the exchange, an unnamed knight draws his sword to kill an adder. The other knights construe this as treachery and a declaration of war. Seeing no other recourse, at the [[Battle of Camlann]], Arthur charges Mordred and impales him with a spear. But with the last of his strength, Mordred impales himself even further, so as to come within striking distance of King Arthur, then gives a mortal blow to Arthur's head.

As he was dying, Arthur commands Bedivere to cast his sword [[Excalibur]] into the lake. Bedivere initially does not throw the sword in the lake, but instead hides it behind a tree. He confesses his reluctance to Arthur, then returns to the lake and throws in his own sword instead of Excalibur. Bedivere once again relays his disobedience to Arthur, who requests the sword be returned to the lake for a third time. When Bedivere finally throws Excalibur back in the lake, it is retrieved by the hand of the [[Lady of the Lake]]. The hand shakes the sword three times and then vanishes back into the water. A barge appears, carrying ladies in black hoods (one being Morgan), who take Arthur to the Isle of [[Avalon]].

After the passing of King Arthur, Malory provides a [[Dramatic structure#D.C3.A9nouement.2C resolution.2C or catastrophe|denouement]], mostly following the lives (and deaths) of Guinevere, Lancelot, and Lancelot's kinsmen. When Lancelot returns to Dover, he mourns the deaths of his comrades. Lancelot travels to Almesbury to see Guinevere. During the civil war, Guinevere is portrayed as a scapegoat for violence without developing her perspective or motivation. However, after Arthur's death, Guinevere retires to a convent in penitence for her infidelity. Her contrition is sincere and permanent; Lancelot is unable to sway her to come away with him. Instead, Lancelot becomes a monk, and is joined in monastic life by his kinsmen. Arthur's successor is appointed ([[Constantine (Briton)|Constantine]], son of King Carados of Scotland), and the realm that Arthur created is significantly changed. After the deaths of Guinevere and Lancelot, Sirs Bors, [[Hector de Maris|Hector]], Blamore, and Bleoberis head to the [[Holy Land]] to crusade, where they die on [[Good Friday]].

* The Victorian poet [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] retold the legends in the poetry volume ''[[Idylls of the King]]'' (1859 and 1885). His work focuses primarily on ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' and the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', but with many expansions, additions, and several adaptations, like the fate of Guinevere. In Malory, she is sentenced to be burnt at the stake but is rescued by Lancelot; in the ''Idylls'' Guinevere flees to a convent, is forgiven by Arthur, repents, and serves in the convent until she dies.
* In 1892, London publisher J. M. Dent &amp; Co. decided to produce an illustrated edition of ''Le Morte Darthur'' in modern spelling. They chose a 20-year-old insurance-office clerk and art student, [[Aubrey Beardsley]], to illustrate the work. It was issued in 12 parts between June 1893 and mid-1894, and met with only modest success at the time. However, it has since been described as Beardsley's first masterpiece, launching what has come to be known as the "Beardsley look".&lt;ref name="Dover"&gt;Dover Publications (1972). ''Beardsley's Illustrations for Le Morte Darthur'', Publisher's note &amp; back cover.&lt;/ref&gt; It was his first major commission, and included nearly 585 chapter openings, borders, initials, ornaments and full- or double-page illustrations. Most of the Dent edition illustrations were reprinted by Dover Publications, New York, in 1972 under the title ''Beardsley's Illustrations for Le Morte Darthur''. A facsimile of the Beardsley edition, complete with Malory's unabridged text, was published in the 1990s.
* [[Howard Pyle]] both wrote and illustrated his series of books: ''[[The Story of King Arthur and His Knights]]'' (1903), ''[[The Story of the Champions of the Round Table]]'' (1905), ''[[The Story of the Champions of the Round Table]]'' (1905), ''[[The Story of Sir Launcelot and His Companions]]'' (1907), and ''[[The Story of the Grail and the Passing of King Arthur]]'' (1910). Instead of just retelling the stories, Pyle came up with new versions of the stories, using other stories and his own imagination to embellish the tales.

[[File:0 Leda et le cygne - P.P. Rubens (2).JPG|thumb|right|''Leda and the Swan'' by Peter Paul Rubens]]
'''''Leda and the Swan''''', by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], who painted two versions of this subject. The first was completed in 1601 and the second in 1602.  

Rubens was heavily influenced by [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, Rubens and Italy, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was introduced to his work on his journey to [[Italy]]. Rubens decided to go to [[Rome]] to make copies of paintings and further his studies of Italian art from the leading Italian artists of the previous century, later termed the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;White, Rubens and His World, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Rome, he encountered [[Leda and the Swan (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo’s version]] of ''Leda and the Swan''. Even though Michelangelo’s version does not exist today, copies of it do.&lt;ref&gt;Georgievska Shine, Rubens and the Archaeology of Myth, 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  A copy of Michelangelo’s original work was done by Rubens. Rubens would have been familiar with Michelangelo’s ''Leda''. His version is considered a prototype for Rubens’s two works.&lt;ref&gt;Huemer, Rubens and the Roman Circle, 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Rubens’s 1601 ''Leda'', was modeled after Michelangelo’s ''Leda''.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, ''Rubens and Italy'', 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The placement of the body is very similar as is its twisting posture. Even the positioning of the fingers is mirrored. The swan is caressing the female in exactly the same way. 

The actual figure of the female varies drastically between Rubens’s style and Michelangelo’s style. Michelangelo typically depicted women in a masculine way. Muscles are more clearly defined and the bodies look hard. The body is thinner. The hair is neatly styled. Michelangelo’s body proportions are a little skewed. Rubens’s women, on the other hand, are extremely curvaceous and are much softer. The hair is somewhat loose and not as styled. The body proportions seem more realistic in Rubens’s two works. 

Though Rubens’s two works are very similar, they do differ. In his first depiction, the brushstrokes are looser, it is not as detailed, there is less landscape, no elaborate headpiece, the colors are muted, and the drapes are green. The 1601 painting was initially supposed to be in a painted ellipse that cut off the left elbow and part of the right foot as seen through x-rays. Today it is in a rectangular format along with the 1602 painting. In his second painting, the brushstrokes are more precise, there is more detail, there is a clearer landscape in the background, an elaborate headpiece, more vibrant colors, and the drapery is white and red.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, Rubens and Italy, 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
A common Renaissance and [[Baroque]] theme is females that are abducted or seduced by divinities.&lt;ref&gt;Georgievska Shine, Rubens and the Archaeology of Myth, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes [[Leda and the swan]] as [[Zeus]], as well as [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], [[Antiope (mother of Amphion)|Antiope]], and [[Danae]].&lt;ref&gt;Georgievska Shine, ''Rubens and the Archaeology of Myth'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Many portrayals of women being seduced by divinities are shown in a sensual manner. For instance, Rubens’s ''Leda'', is very erotic. Leda is shown fully nude with her buttocks and left breast being visible. The swan is caressing her on her most intimate area with its neck cradled between her breasts. The swan is depicted as a graceful animal who also can ravish. 

There are many variations to the myth of Leda and the swan. Leda is sometimes called Nemesis and other times they are two separate people.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, The Greek Myths, 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Leda was married to the king of Sparta, Tyndareus.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, ''The Dictionary of Classical Mythology'', 254.&lt;/ref&gt;  She is the mother of several children though she is most known for giving birth to Clytemnestra, Helen, Pollux, and Castor.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, The Dictionary of Classical Mythology, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common myth claims that Zeus transformed himself into a swan to couple with Leda.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, ''The Dictionary of Classical Mythology'', 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some versions claim that she loved Zeus and willing had sexual relations with him, while other versions claim she was seduced and therefore was not willing.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, The Dictionary of Classical Mythology, 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  That same night, she coupled with Tyndareus also.&lt;ref&gt;Hathorn, Greek Mythology, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Leda then gave birth to four children at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, The Dictionary of Classical Mythology, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; The two pairs of twins resulted in Helen and Pollux belonging to Zeus, and Clytemnestra and Castor belonging to Tyndareus.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, ''The Dictionary of Classical Mythology'', 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Though each pair is attributed to either Zeus or Tyndareus, each man is said to be the father of all four children.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, ''The Dictionary of Classical Mythology'', 254.&lt;/ref&gt;  Castor and Pollux were called the Dioscuri meaning “Zeus’s sons,” even though Castor was mortal because he was the son of Tyndareus and Pollux was immortal because he was the son of Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;Hathorn, ''Greek Mythology'', 82.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
According to Hermes in Lucians’ ''The Dialogues of the Dead'', Leda and her daughter (Helen of Troy) are the only women worthy of the title “beauties of old.”&lt;ref&gt;Georgievska Shine, Rubens and the Archaeology of Myth, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Rubens’s depictions of Leda clearly embody the phrase. With Leda’s curvy figure, alabaster skin, and golden hair, she is a sight to behold. Because Rubens was known for this type of female figures, Leda was the perfect subject to paint. Rubens became famous partly for his Rubenesque figures and were not common at the time, making his two ''Leda’s'' stand out even more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2199">'''Les Dames d'Escoffier''' is a [[society]] of [[professional]] [[women]] involved in the [[food]], [[wine]], and [[hospitality]] [[industries]]. 

==History==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Les Dames d'Escoffier is a leadership culinary organization composed of women who have not only achieved success in their profession, but who contribute significantly to their communities. Since its incorporation 25 years ago, Les Dames d'Escoffier has followed its mission to elevate the profession through mentoring members and helping worthy students succeed in their culinary careers. I am very proud to be a member.
:— Julia Child, 2001&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Les Dames d'Escoffier was founded in [[New York City]] in 1976, in honor of [[Auguste Escoffier]], whom Les Dames' [[mission statement]] credits with having "single-handedly brought the [[culinary]] art into the [[modern era]]". Escoffier "elevated the role of [[Cook (profession)|cooks]] from that of [[laborers]] to [[artists]]"; when he died, he "left the world a new art, that of dining". With expansion to other cities, Les Dames d'Escoffier International (LDEI) was formed in 1985 to operate as an [[umbrella organization]]. Membership is by invitation only and exclusive to women who have distinguished themselves in the respective fields with which Les Dames is concerned.

==Events==
Les Dames organizes various food-related activities throughout the year, the majority of which are dinners; new members are inducted during the "annual gala dinners". Les Dames' major [[philanthropy|philanthropic activity]] consists of promoting the education and advancement of women in careers related to food industries. The society provides scholarships for women desiring to become professionals or to advance their skills in the fields of food, wine, other beverages, nutrition, the arts of the table and related disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/fales/dames.html NYU's Fales Library Guide to the Les Dames d'Escoffier New York Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing contexts==
Chinese instruments are either played solo, collectively in large orchestras (as in the former imperial court) or in smaller ensembles (in teahouses or public gatherings). Normally, there is no conductor in traditional Chinese music, nor any use of musical scores or tablature in performance. Music was generally learned aurally and memorized by the musician(s) beforehand, then played without aid. As of the 20th century, musical scores have become more common, as has the use of conductors in larger orchestral-type ensembles.

==Musical instruments in use in the 1800s==
These watercolour illustrations, made in China in the 1800s, show several types of musical instruments being played:

The following is an alphabetical list of works of art that are often called by a non-English name in an English context. (Of course, many such titles are simply the names of people: ''[[Don Quixote]]'', ''[[Irma la Douce]]'', ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'', ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande]]''. These have been omitted, as have examples where the English may easily be inferred: ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', ''[[Les liaisons dangereuses]]''.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21545">A '''record chart''', also known as a '''music chart''', is a method of ranking [[music]] judging by the [[popularity]] during a given period of time. Examples of record charts are the [[Hit parade]], [[Hot 100]] or [[Top 40]]. Although primarily a marketing or supermarketing tool like any other [[sales]] statistic, they have become a form of popular media culture in their own right.

Record charts are compiled using a variety of criteria. These commonly include sales of [[Gramophone record|records]], [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]] and [[compact disc]]s; amount of [[radio]] airplay; requests to radio [[disk jockey]]s; voting for songs by the radio listeners and, recently, number of [[music download|download]]s.

Some charts are specific to a particular [[musical genre]] and most to a particular geographical location. The most common period of time covered by a chart is one week, with the chart being printed or broadcast at the end of this time. Summary charts for years and decades are then calculated from their component weekly charts.  [[Component chart]]s have become an increasingly important way to measure the commercial success of individual songs.

Reviewers often describe records using [[round number]] milestones within a chart. For example, a record that peaks at number 7 may be called a "Top 10" [[hit single|hit]], even when there is no chart limited to only the top 10 records in that particular location.

[[Image:Madwomannahadr.jpg|thumb|African American Performance Artist Mem Nahadr as "Madwoman"]]
'''''Madwoman: A Contemporary Opera''''' (also known as ''Madwoman'') is an [[opera]] - [[performance art]] work created by the American performance artist and composer [[Mem Nahadr]] (also known as M). It depicts a series of compositions, "M-mination" from a woman with [[Albinism]], deemed a "Madwoman" by society because of her depth of understanding and unconditional Self Acceptance.  This art piece is presented in an interactive multimedia installation of space, UV light, 5.1 surround sound, items, images and concepts. This installation includes a one-woman live performance by Mem Nahadr, and stands as a sculptured interactive artpiece otherwise. 

Supported by a team of artists and technicians, this presentation includes a multimedia system created by [[James P. Nichols]], Broadway, Jazz and Grammy Award Winning Producer/Engineer; as well as Creative - Stage Direction by Claude E. Sloan, Jr., of the LOEB Drama Center Experimental Theater at Harvard, and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Public Theater.

Album cover for the opera was photographed by the famed fashion photographer and Human Rights organizational founder, Rick Guidotti of Positive Exposure.

An excerpt from the ''Madwoman'' opera was performed before [[Queen Beatrix]] of Holland during the 25th annual [[Veerstichting]] Symposium at the St. Pieterskerk church in Lieden, The Netherlands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5430">A '''manifest''', '''customs manifest''' or '''cargo document''' is a [[document]] listing the [[cargo]], [[passenger]]s, and [[crew]] of a [[ship]], [[aircraft]], or [[vehicle]], for the use of [[customs]] and other officials. Where such a list is limited to identifying passengers, it is a '''passenger manifest''' or '''passenger list'''; conversely, a list limited to identifying cargo is a '''cargo manifest''' or '''cargo list'''. The manifest may be used by people having an interest in the transport to ensure that passengers and cargo listed as having been placed on board the transport at the beginning of its passage continue to be on board when it arrives at its destination.&lt;blockquote&gt;This document, made up generally by the ship's broker, from the contents of the [[Bill of lading|bills of lading]], contains a specification of the nature and quantity of the cargo laden, and is generally attested officially, and in some countries notarially. The [[Prize (law)|prize laws]] seldom mention this paper ; nor is it general ; but yet of essential importance in case of search, as well for belligerents, as for neutrals in procuring a speedy dismissal. It is usual to require it at the [[Customs|custom]] house.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=fIUuAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=%22passport+bill+of+lading%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hhnjnpF6Zb&amp;sig=4xgrojj4cR-w9wx_qnTQK8OqrJI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBrZH2-4naAhUBQBQKHd1xCB8Q6AEIODAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22passport%20bill%20of%20lading%22&amp;f=false|title=Laws of the Sea: With Reference to Maritime Commerce During Peace and War|last=Jacobsen|first=Friedrich Johann|date=1818|publisher=Edward J. Coale.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this way, a cargo manifest is like a [[passport]] except that it is used for [[goods]] instead of (or in addition to) [[Person|persons]]; the manifest is evidence to the [[nationality]] of the goods, the absence of [[contraband]], and that property belonging to [[Belligerent|belligerents]] is not laden on board of the vessel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Vessels are under no legal obligation to carry a manifest and, indeed, it is only necessary for neutral vessels in a time of war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cargo manifest vs. bill of lading ==
A cargo manifest and a [[bill of lading]] may carry similar information and the concepts are not always clearly distinguished. In some cases, a single document may serve both purposes. In general, a bill of lading serves as a [[legal instrument]] focusing on and documenting such issues as [[ownership]], whereas a cargo manifest is often more concerned with physical aspects of the cargo, such as [[weight]] and [[size]]. When the cargo is being shipped by several different shipping companies on the same vessel, there will usually be separate bills of lading for each company, but only a single consolidated cargo manifest. On the other hand, if the cargo contains [[dangerous goods]], there may be a separate dangerous cargo manifest. 
 
==Uses==
===Customs and excise===
[[Customs|Customs authorities]] may require cargo-carrying vessels or vehicles to provide information on the cargo manifest such as its consignor, consignee, quantity of goods, origin, destination and value.&lt;ref name=BusinessDictionary&gt;Business Dictionary.com, "[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/manifest.html Manifest]", retrieved 23 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===International travel===
Immigration authorities may require passenger-carrying vessels or vehicles to provide a passenger manifest listing information such as names and ports of embarkation and disembarkation.&lt;ref name=BusinessDictionary/&gt;

===Disasters===
In case of [[disaster]]s, passenger manifests may be helpful in identifying casualties and notifying families of passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Code of Federal Regulations]] |chapter-url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/243.1 |chapter=14 CFR Part 243 - Passenger Manifest Information, §243.1 Purpose }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 13, 1997 |title=Domestic Passenger Manifest Information – Advance notice of proposed rulemaking |url=https://www.epic.org/privacy/faa/passenger_manifest_397.html |journal=Federal Register |volume=62 |number=49 |access-date=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cargo manifests can support [[insurance claim]]s for lost goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Customer Support – Marine Cargo Claims / Documents Required |author= |url=http://www.ecics.com.sg/customer-support.html |publisher=[[List of insurance companies in Singapore|ECICS Limited]] |date=2014 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
Manifests can be useful tools for [[archaeology]]. For example, researchers used old ship's manifests to recreate the available amenities in their restoration of the historic [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|Custom House Plaza]] in [[Monterey, California]],&lt;ref&gt;Maxine Cass, ''Northern California Off the Beaten Path, 8th: A Guide to Unique Places'' (2009), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; which was built in 1821 and remains the oldest public building in [[California]].

'''Modern Kannada literature''' refers to the body of literature written in the [[Kannada language]], a language spoken mainly in the Indian state of [[Karnataka]]. The [[Kannada script]] is the writing system used in Kannada literature. In the last forty years, eight modern Kannada authors have been awarded the [[Jnanpith|Jnanpith award]], a prestigious private literary award in India.&lt;ref name="jnanpith"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jnanpith.net/laureates/index.html|title=Awardees detail for the Jnanpith Award|work=Official website of Bharatiya Jnanpith|publisher=Bharatiya Jnanpith|accessdate=2008-02-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013122739/http://jnanpith.net/laureates/index.html |archivedate = 13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]], the second-highest award for literature granted by the [[Government of India]], has been conferred upon Kannada writers fifty times.&lt;ref name="sahitya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahitya-akademi.org/sahitya-akademi/awa10307.htm#kannada|author=|title=Sahitya Akademi Awards 1955-2005|work=Sahitya Akademi|accessdate=2007-12-09|publisher=Photodisc (India) Pvt.

==Dawn of modern literature==

===1800–1900===
[[File:Kittel, Ferdinand (1832-1903).jpg|left|thumb|upright|Ferdinand Kittel (1832–1903), Christian missionary and Kannada writer.]]
The nascent beginnings of modern Kannada literature can be traced to the early 19th century under the stewardship of Maharaja [[Krishnaraja Wodeyar III]], the ruler of the [[princely state]] of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], and court poets who attempted to steer away from the ancient ''champu'' form of prose and popularize prose renderings of Sanskrit epics and plays. Kempu Narayana's ''Mudramanjusha'' ("Seal Casket", 1823) can be considered the first modern novel, anterior to English influence on Kannada. Though inspired by Vishakhadatta's Sanskrit original ''Mudrarakshasa'', the work displays a creativity of its own.&lt;ref name="mudra"&gt;Murthy in George K.M(1992), p 168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dic"/&gt;

The impetus to modern literature came from a Western-style education and the Christian missionaries who relied on the local language to propagate the gospel. The arrival of the printing press was a catalyst to this process. Among the several early Kannada publications, the first Kannada-English dictionary by [[Ferdinand Kittel]] (1894) is noteworthy.&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;Kamath (2001), p 280&lt;/ref&gt; B. L. Rice edited and published ancient Kannada classics and compiled a brief history of Kannada literature, while J. H. Fleet compiled a collection of folk ballads including the well-known ''[[Sangolli Rayanna|Sangoli Rayana]] Dange'' ("The Revolt of Sangolli Raya"). The most outstanding lyrical poet of this period, whose poems were reminiscent of the medieval mystic Kannada poetry, was Sisunala Sharief.&lt;ref name="sisunala"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 168&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of the 19th century, progress towards original works in prose narratives initially gained momentum through translations from Sanskrit, English (''Yatrikana Sanchara'' from "The Pilgrims Progress", 1847), Marathi (''Yamuna Paryatana'') and Bengali languages (''Durgesanandini''). Early dramatic literatures were translations from Sanskrit (''Shakuntala'', 1869) and English (''Macbeth'', ''King Lear'' and ''Romeo and Juliet'').&lt;ref name="durgesh"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp 168-169&lt;/ref&gt;
 
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:BMSrikantiah.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Father of modern Kannada literature, B. M. Srikantaiah (1881 – 1946).]] --&gt;
With the standardization of modern prose, the earliest original social fictions were ''Suryakantha'' by Lakshman Gadagkar (1892) and ''Indira Bai'' by Gulvadi Venkata Rao (1899). With the theme being reform, the latter work critically examines social issues, reflecting an awakening.&lt;ref name="Bai"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hoary"&gt;Kamath (2001), p 281&lt;/ref&gt; Original plays carrying the same theme include, among others, the ''Iggappa Heggadeya Vivaha Prahasana'' by Suri Venkataramana Sastri (1887). Nanadalike Lakshminarayana ('Muddanna') wrote two important prose pieces; ''Adbhuta Ramayana'' (1895) and ''Ramaswamedham'' (1898). What makes the latter writing historically important is that the epic Ramayana is looked at from a modern sensibility with the author as the narrator and his wife as the listener, the narration being interrupted at various stages with humorous exchanges between the couple, resulting from questions raised by the listener.&lt;ref name="padyam"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 170&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from the age of verse to prose may be summed up with Muddanna's proclamation "poetry deserves killing whereas prose reaches the heart" ("Padyam Vadyam, Gadyam Hridyam").&lt;ref name="dic"/&gt;

==The Renaissance==

===1900-1925===

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:DRBendre.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Lyricist, [[D. R. Bendre]] (1896 – 1981).]] --&gt;
With the turn of the 20th century, [[B. M. Srikantaiah]] ('B. M. Sri'), regarded by some as the "Father of modern Kannada literature",&lt;ref name="greek"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp 1077-78&lt;/ref&gt; gave the call for writing originals in modern Kannada, emancipating the language from ancient courtly classics and stressing the need for the influence of English literature. This period can be considered a seed time, for a golden age to come. His adaptation of lyrics from English were effective, the best known among his works being the ''English Geethagalu'' ("English Songs"), a seminal work that set the trend for "Navodaya" (new birth) Kannada poetry to come.&lt;ref name="geeta"&gt;Murthi (1992), p 171&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable poets who were able to evolve new metrics out of old ones were [[Masti Venkatesh Iyengar]] in his poem of love and tragedy, the ''Madalingana Kanive'' ("Madalinga's Valley", 1924) and [[Govinda Pai]] in the ''Kavitavatara'' (1916).&lt;ref name="geeta"/&gt;

Though Panje Manjesh Rao (1900) is considered a pioneer in the field of short stories, it is Masti Venkatesh Iyengar who is credited for laying the foundation for a generation of short-story tellers with his ''Kelavu Sanna Kathegalu'' ("A few Short Stories", 1920) and ''Sanna Kathegalu'' ("Short Stories", 1924).&lt;ref name="short"&gt;Murthi (1992), p 172&lt;/ref&gt;

The consolidation of modern drama was pioneered by [[T. P. Kailasam]], a towering personality in the field, with his ''Tollu Gatti'' ("The Hollow and the Solid", 1918). In contrast to the earlier ''Indira Bai'' (1899), this work examines the modern education system from a [[Mohandas Gandhi|Gandhian]] viewpoint. Kailasam followed this with ''Tali Kattoke Cooline'' ("Wages for tying the [[Mangalsutra]]"), a story that criticizes the [[dowry]] system in marriage.&lt;ref name="geeta"/&gt; Kailasam's plays were mainly concerned with problems effecting middle class Brahmin families; the dowry system, religious persecution, woes in the extended family system and exploitation of women. He represented for the first time in Kannada theatre, a spokesperson for liberal values and is thus considered by some as the one who laid the foundation of amateur Kannada theatre.&lt;ref name="amateur"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1077&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarizing the earlier historicals written in English by B. L. Rice, J. H. Fleet, Robert Sewell and Bhandarkar, Alur Ventaka Rao wrote the novel ''Karnataka Ghatavaibhava'' (1917). The work was intended to re-kindle pride among [[Kannadiga]]s about their glorious past and bring awareness about the great rulers, poets and saints who had originated from Karnataka, its traditions and its heritage in arts and architecture.&lt;ref name="hoary" /&gt;

===1925–1950===

====Navodaya====
The Navodaya period saw the rise of acclaimed [[lyricist]]s who combined mystic poetry of the ''Vachanas'' and ''Kirthanas'' of medieval times and the native folk songs of oral traditions with influences from modern English romantics. Best known among them are [[D. R. Bendre]], [[Gopalakrishna Adiga]], K. V. Puttappa ([[Kuvempu]]), [[Shivarama Karanth]], [[V. K. Gokak]], Masti Venkatesh Iyengar, [[D. V. Gundappa]] ('DVG'), [[P. T. Narasimhachar]], M. V. Seetharamiah, G. P. Rajaratnam, [[K. S. Narasimhaswamy]] and [[Adya Rangacharya]] ('Sri Ranga') and [[Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar]].&lt;ref name="nara"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 173-175&lt;/ref&gt;

Bendre is perhaps the most outstanding of modern Kannada lyricists, authoring a collection of 27 poems, including such masterpieces as ''Gari'' ("Wing", 1932), ''Nadaleela'' (1938) and ''Sakhigeetha'' (1940). His poems had a transcendental quality about them which were neither narrative or dramatic.&lt;ref name="lyrical"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 413&lt;/ref&gt; They cover a wide range of themes including patriotism, love of nature, conjugal love, transcendental experiences and sympathy for the poor. The ''Sakhigeetha'' is an autobiographical poem about his married life and personal experiences.&lt;ref name="sakhigeeta"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 173&lt;/ref&gt; Bendre had sworn that, in his poetry, he would "rather sow stars in Kannada soil than brillian jewels".&lt;ref name="star"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 792&lt;/ref&gt;

The beauty and grandeur of the [[Malnad]] hills strongly influenced Kuvempu, one of Kannada's doyen poets, in his ''Kalki'' (1933) in which the poet describes the life of the agrarian community. He further showed his brilliance in using the blank verse in his masterpiece and ''magnum opus'' that took him nine years to write, the ''Sri Ramayana Darshanam'' (1949) which contains 22,284 lines, divided into 50 [[canto]]s.&lt;ref name="kattu"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 174&lt;/ref&gt; This work marks the beginning of modern Kannada epic poetry. While the poem follows the [[Valmiki]] tradition, Kuvempu puts a stamp of originality on it, bringing together the Indian and western epic traditions.

In a departure from the original epic, Lanka ([[Ceylon]]) does not burn in the war nor does [[Sita]] enter the fire alone (called ''[[Agni]] Pravesha''), but rather is followed by Rama. Both however reappear from the fire unscathed giving the mortals a glimpse of their divinity. Not only is Sita's chastity proven, so is Rama's fidelity towards her. Like medieval poet Nagachandra, Kuvempu portrays Ravana as an "evolving soul". He pays homage to all the great poets of the world, including the sage Valmiki, thus placing himself in the tradition of world epic poetry.&lt;ref name="valmiki"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1182&lt;/ref&gt; The work abounds in metaphors and similes and brings home the thought that all living beings will eventually evolve into perfect beings. In the words of a historian, "No one could have imagined that the Kannada language is capable of this complex musical quality, for the first time in this century was Kannada made a language worthy of the gods".&lt;ref name="worthy"&gt;Punekar in Sahity Akademi (1992), p 4160&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Venkatesh Iyengar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Short story writer, Masti Venkatesh Iyengar (1891 – 1986).]] --&gt;
Govinda Pai succeeded in depicting an authentic Christian ambience in the ''Golgotha'' (1931). Considered a unique Christian work in Indian literature, Pai narrates in detail, starting from the Christ being taken to [[Pontius Pilate]] by a hostile group of Jews demanding his death and the events leading to his crucifixion at [[Golgotha]]. The success of this work encouraged Pai to follow with three [[panegyric]]s in 1947; ''Vaishakhi'', ''Prabhasa'' and ''Dehali'', narrating the last days of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], God [[Krishna]] and [[Gandhi]] respectively.&lt;ref name="vaisakhi"&gt;Das (1995), p 148&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gilivindu'' is his first collection of poems. Forty-six in all, they bring out his love for nature, his country and Kannada language while the ''Nandadeepa'', a collection of 37 poems are about devotion to god.&lt;ref name="kattu"/&gt;

The influence of the west inspired a new genre in writing, the ''[[essay]]''. Here, A. N. Murthy Rao's ''Hagaluganasugalu'' ("Day Dreams", 1937) is best known.&lt;ref name="kanasu"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 179&lt;/ref&gt;

M. V. Seetharamiah came to limelight during the peak of the Navodaya period and was inspired by such well-known writers as B. M. Srikantaiah and Masti Venkatesh Iyengar. A man of many talents, he was a renowned poet (''Hakki Hadu'' or "Bird Song"), novelist ("Robinson Crusoe"), short story writer (''Maargadharshaka''), painter, musician, literary critic, researcher, dramatist (''Swayamvara'' or "Choice of a Husband"), essayist (''Hidi Hoovu'' or "Handful of flowers") and biographer (''Kavi Ranna'' or "Poet Ranna"). To his credit are twelve collections of poems, ten collections of short stories, nine novels, four collections of essays, and nine plays.&lt;ref name="seetha"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), pp 3902-3903&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Seetharamiah's contributions carry a liberal message of love for his surroundings, nature and mankind. An authority on Kannada grammar and literary history, it is to his credit for researching and establishing that the true author of the 9th century Kannada classic ''Kavirajamarga'' may have been poet Sri Vijaya in the court of King [[Amoghavarsha I]]. He established a research foundation in the name of his mentor, B. M. Srikantaiah ("B. M. Srikantaiah Prathishtana").&lt;ref name="essayist"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 3903&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the closest in comparison to the wisdom poems of the late medieval poet Sarvajna is the ''[[Mankuthimmana Kagga]]'' ("Dull Thimma's Rigmarole", 1943) by D. V. Gundappa. A successful [[journalist]], he was known for his command over the Kannada language and its classics, with a knowledge of Sanskrit as well, despite his limited education which was limited to matriculation only. These qualities and experiences were to serve him well as a writer. Attributed to him are 60 writings in just about every genre of modern Kannada with the exception of the novel. His adaptation of Shakespeare's ''Macbeth'' into Kannada is well acclaimed.&lt;ref name="gund"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1057&lt;/ref&gt;

The celebrated writer of conjugal love poems, who is known to have been inspired by [[Robert Burns]], K. S. Narasimhaswamy won critical acclaim for ''Mysore Mallige'' ("Mysore Jasmine", 1942), a description of the bliss of everyday marital life.&lt;ref name="bliss"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 175&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, his poems were more metaphysical and included contemporary events in ''Dominion Janana'' and the ''Samsara Rajyanga''.&lt;ref name="male"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 665&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Shivaramakaranth.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Poet, playwright &amp; novelist, Shivarama Karanth (1902 – 1997).]] --&gt;
Eminent poets produced inspiring poetic dramas, B. M. Srikantiah being the trailblazer with his ''Gadayuddha Natakam'' ("The War of Clubs", 1925), a modern version of Ranna's 982 classic and ''Aswaththaman'', a native version of the [[Culture of Greece|Greek]] play ''Ajax'' by Sophocles. This was the beginning of tragic drama in Kannada, and a new way portraying ancient local heroes.&lt;ref name="greek"/&gt;

Govinda Pai's ''Hebberalu'' ("Thumb", 1946) dramatizes the story of [[Drona]] and [[Ekalavya]], characters from the epic Mahabharata.&lt;ref name="bliss"/&gt; Kailasam and his worthy contemporary, A. N. Swamy Venkatadri Iyer ('Samsa') continued to produce fine dramas. Samsa is credited with writing twenty-three plays, of which only six have survived. Of these, a [[trilogy]] on the Mysore King Ranadhira Kanteerava are well known; ''Vigada Vikramarya'' ("The Wicked Vikramarya", 1928), ''Vijayanarasimha'' (1936) and ''Mantrashakti'' in (1938).&lt;ref name="mantra"/&gt;

Sri Ranga was a dominating and complete authority as a playwright, though he has penned poems and novels as well. In a period of forty years, he authored more than 40 full-length plays and more than 100 one-act plays. His plays, filled with wit and satire, are divided over two periods, the first between 1930 and 1952 where they mostly concerned with social issues.&lt;ref name="dharwad"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 89&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote on Gandhian values and the decadence caused by the caste system in his ''Harijanwara'' ("The [[Harijan]] week", 1934), the ''Sandhyakala'' (1939) and the ''Sokachakra'' (1952).&lt;ref name="mantra"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 176&lt;/ref&gt;

The wit and satire in Kailasam's language, Kannada laced with English, and the social reformer in him are best exemplified in his plays ''Bahishkara'' (1929) which focusses on religious practices, and ''Soole'' ("Prostitute", 1945), which dwells on social problems.&lt;ref name="mantra"/&gt;

The 1930s saw the rise of another major figure in Kannada literature, Shivarama Karanth, who debuted in play ''Garbhagudi'' ("Sanctum", 1932), which decries the exploitation of society in the name of religion.&lt;ref name="karanth"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 177&lt;/ref&gt; A series of successful novels were written by him in this period, best known among which are ''Chomana Dudi'' ("Choma's Toil", 1933) which describes the plight of a harijan in Indian society and ''Marali Mannige'' ("Back to the Soil", 1942), a story about rural life on the west coast centred on a family's evolution over three generations, during a time of change brought about by westernization. Kuvempu's well accepted ''Kanur Subbamma Heggadithi'' ("Subbamma Heggadithi of Kanur", 1936) is about an educated protagonist in a conservative society.&lt;ref name="compatible"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 178&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:VKGokak.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Poet, playwright &amp; novelist, V. K. Gokak (1909 – 1992).]] --&gt;
V. K. Gokak, who was educated in [[Oxford]], established himself as an important contributor to poetics, criticism, drama and the novel in Kannada, with no less than 55 books to his credit. In addition, he was a distinguished critic of Indo-English literature. His other interests included culture, religion, philosophy and education. His first novel, ''Ijjodu'' ("Misalliance", 1935) dwells on marital problems caused by sexual incompatibility.&lt;ref name="compatible" /&gt; His short stay in England helped confirm his love for his native country and language, resulting in the generation of ''Samudragitegalu'' ("Sea songs", 1940) and ''Samudradacheyinda'' ("From Beyond the Seas", 1940), the latter being a travelogue on his experiences there. His real epic, ''Bharata Sindhu Rashmi'' runs into 35,000 lines with the introduction in English.&lt;ref name="phil"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1437&lt;/ref&gt;

Masti Venkatesh Iyengar continued to dominate in short stories with such classics as ''Kakana Kote'' ("Kaka's Fort", 1938), a novel that remained obscure for some time. Set in a tribal atmosphere, the story brings out the life of a tiny hamlet which eventually merges with a feudal chiefdom. Masti's description of their life, love and society is authentic and natural.&lt;ref name="tribals"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1078&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether P. T. Narasimhachar wrote an essay, a play or a poem, the poet in him was always evident. He has three collection of essays to his credit; ''Rathasaprami'' (1935), ''Ecchalumarada Kelage'' (1949) and ''Dhenukapurana'' (1969).&lt;ref name="dhenu"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1220&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable writers of this period were Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar and Ajjampur Sitaram ('Ananda'). Gorur gave up studies to join the freedom struggle at the age of 17 and came under the enduring influence of Mahatma Gandhi whom he knew personally. He was active in the promotion of the "Cottage Industry" at the village level in the erstwhile Mysore state. A marvelous story teller, his first book ''Halliya Chitrgalu'' ("Village Vignettes", 1930) won him many laurels for his keen observation and narration of the beauty of rustic life.&lt;ref name="kanasu"/&gt; He followed this with several stories, describing on one hand the casteism and superstitions of rural communities and on the other the simplicity and charm in these communities. In addition to stories, he has to his credit essays, skits, travelogues and novels. In fact among the first novels ever to be written on the independence struggle was penned by him and is titled ''Merevanige'' ("Procession", 1948).&lt;ref name="mere"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1451&lt;/ref&gt; Ananda's outstanding book, ''Nanu Konda Hudugi'' ("The Girl I Killed") is a tragedy centred on a girl who commits suicide after social disgrace.

Gopalakrishna Adiga describes the joy of political independence in ''Kattuvevu Navu'' ("We Shall Built", 1948), a longing for spiritual values in ''Mohana Murali'' (1944) and the importance of individual freedom in ''Samaja Bhairava''.&lt;ref name="kattu"/&gt;

===1950–1975===

====Late Navodaya====
[[File:S.L.Bhyrappa.jpg|thumb|upright|S.L.Bhyrappa, noted Kannada novelist]]
This period saw the emergence of new trends such as the Navya (modernist) and Pragatishila (progressive) though the legends of the previous era continued to produce notable works in the older Navodaya style. In poetry, D. R. Bendre's ''Naku Tanti'' ("Four Strings", 1964) and Kuvempu's ''Aniketana'' (1964) are well known. Gokak brought out the innate insufficiencies in the more advanced western cultures in ''Indilla Nale'' (1965).&lt;ref name="shoka"&gt;Murthy (1992), pp 179-180&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:KSNa.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Romance poet, K. S. Narasimhaswamy (1915 – 2003).]] --&gt;
The Navodaya style novels continued to be successful with such noteworthy works as Shivarama Karanth's ''Mookajjiya Kanasugalu'' ("Mookajji's Visions", 1968), where the author explores the origins of mans' faith in the mother goddess and the stages of evolution of civilization. Kuvempu's ''Malegallali Madumagalu'' ("The Bride of the Hills", 1967) is about loving relationships that exist in every strata of society. Being a playwright, Sri Ranga gave a dramatic touch to his ''Purushartha'' (1947) where the entire action is on 15 August 1947, and the protagonist and his three friends reminisce about the past.&lt;ref name="august"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Masti Ventakesh Iyengar's two classic novels of this era were the ''Channabasavanayaka'' (1950), which describes the overthrow of Bidanur's chief Channabasava Nayaka (on Karnataka's coast) by [[Hyder Ali|Haider Ali]] in the late 18th century, and ''Chickavirarajendra'' (1950), which describes the fall of the tiny kingdom of [[Coorg]] ruled by King Chikka Virarajendra into the hands of the [[British East India Company]]. Masti describes the social, economic, political and cultural situation at that time and the methods used by the British to gain territorial control.&lt;ref name="anasuya"/&gt; The common theme in both works is the despotism and tyranny of the incumbent native rulers resulting in the intervention of a foreign power, which appears on the scene to restore order, but has its own imperialistic intentions.&lt;ref name="vira"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 689&lt;/ref&gt;

Masti's other important stories are ''Navaratri'' ("Nine Nights") and his epic ''Sri Rama Pattabhishekha'' ("Rama's Coronation", 1972). The latter story begins with the end of the Ramayana war and the return of Rama, Sita and [[Lakshmana]] to Ayodhya. Rama, who is crowned as King of Ayodhya is elevated to the level of a "perfect man", who has overcome extreme difficulties, his personage being described through the viewpoint of several people who have been in close association with him.&lt;ref name="Ahyodhya"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1183&lt;/ref&gt;

A charismatic young writer, [[S. L. Bhyrappa]] made his presence felt from the 1960s with his first novel ''Dharmasri'', though it was his ''Vamsavriksha'' ("Family Tree", 1966) that put him in the spotlight as one of Kannada's most popular novelists. It is a story of a respected scholar, Srinivasa Srotri, his family and their long held values. The protagonist's young and widowed daughter-in-law wishes to remarry, putting his family tradition at risk.&lt;ref name="bhy"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 429&lt;/ref&gt; His best was yet to come with the ''Grihabhanga'' ("Breaking of a Home", 1970), a story of a woman who tries in vain to survive under tragic circumstances. The characters in the story are rustic and often use vulgar language. Other important novels are ''Datu'' ("Crossing", 1973) which portrays a harijan who revolts against the caste system,&lt;ref name="hari"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 182&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Parva'', a major work in Kannada fiction and an admirable attempt at recreating life on the sub-continent during the time of the epic Mahabharata.&lt;ref name="fic"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 430&lt;/ref&gt;

Important women writers of the time were Tirumalamba, the first woman novelist; Anasuya Shankar (popularly known as ''[[Anasuya Shankar|Triveni]]''), who authored the famous novel ''[[Sharapanjara]]'' or "Cage of Arrows"; and [[M. K. Indira]], who offered insight into women's problems.&lt;ref name="anasuya"&gt;Murthy (1992) p 181&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pragatishila====
For a short while, a simplistic form of fiction literature called [[Pragatishila]] (progressive), meant for the common man, gained popularity. The earliest writing in this style is ascribed to [[A. N. Krishna Rao]] ('An Ka Ru') who portrayed an idealistic musician in ''Sandhyaraga'' (1935). The best-known writers in this class are Basavaraj Kattimani who celebrated the heroes of the [[Quit India Movement]] in ''Madi Madidavaru'' ("Those Who Did and Died"), the tenacity of a journalist in ''Jwalamuhkiyamele'' ("On the Volcano", 1951), and the rural atmosphere in ''Mannu mattu hennu'' ("Soil and Women"). His ''Mohada Baleyalli'' ("Caught in Passion") describes immorality in religious institutions.&lt;ref name="katti"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 183&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. R. Subba Rao]] dropped out of school to join the freedom struggle but later came under the influence of well known journalist S. K. Sharma and the passionate Kannada writer A. N. Krishna Rao. After a short stint as a journalist, Subba Rao took to writing short stories though his talent and consequent popularity was due to his novels. Subba Rao's numerous stories are intense and full of idealism but always with a human face. His early novels, ''Purushavatara'' and ''Munjavininda Munjavu'' concerned the problems of the underprivileged, the downtrodden and the outcaste.&lt;ref name="hoovu"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4185&lt;/ref&gt;

A native of Chitradurga, many of Subba Rao's stories have this region as the backdrop, drawing on its rich history and the heroics of its Palegar chiefs. His later novels show an inclination towards philosophy, in contrast to his earlier atheist beliefs.&lt;ref name="chitra"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4186&lt;/ref&gt; Best known among his novels are ''Masanada Hoovu'' ("Flower from a Cemetery") a story about the plight of prostitutes, and historicals such as ''Durgasthamana'' and ''Hamsa Gite'' ("Swan Song"), a story about a dedicated musician of the late 18th century during annexation of [[Chitradurga]] by [[Tipu sultan]].&lt;ref name="katti"/&gt;

====Navya====
It was Gokak who gave the call that the Navya (modernist) poetic era had arrived, with his ''Navya kavitegalu'' ("Modern Poems", 1950). With the passing of the Gandhi era and the influences it had upon the minds of people, a new era in which to express modern sensibilities had arrived. Gopalakrishna Adiga is considered the father of this expression with his ''Nadedu Banda Dari'' ("The Path Traversed", 1952) where he sought inspiration from [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[W. H. Auden|Auden]]. His other famous poems are ''Gondalapura'' ("Pandemonium", 1954), ''Bhoota'' (1959) and others.&lt;ref name="bhoota"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 184&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:U R Ananthamurthy.JPG|right|upright|thumb|200px|Novelist and Jnanapith awardee, U. R. Ananthamurthy.]]
Though he belonged to the earlier Navodaya generation in the Gokak mould, [[G. S. Shivarudrappa]] made his mark in the Navya period too. His ''Mumbai Jataka'' ("A Horoscope of Bombay", 1966) takes a closer look at urbanized society in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref name="ahmed"/&gt; A protege of Kuvempu, Shivarudrappa gained fame at the peak of the popularity of romantic poems with his ''Samagma'' ("Songs of Equanimity", 1951), poems which are known to have an idealistic bend. He continued to produce more poems in the same vein, such as ''Cheluvu Olavu'' ("Beauty and Truth", 1953) and ''Devashilpa'' ("Divine Sculpture", 1959), though in his later poems a gradual shift to social issues with a streak of admiration for god's creation is seen.&lt;ref name="creation"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4031&lt;/ref&gt; As a critic, Shivarudrappa has authored several books, some about Kannada poets and others a comparison of eastern and western cultures, such as ''Vimarsheya Purva Paschima'' (1961), a critique on attitudes; ''Soundarya Samikshe'' (1969), on aesthetic values; and ''Mahakavya Swarupa'' (1971), on the practice of the epic form. His critical essay, ''Anuranana'' (1980), is about the Vachana poets of the 12th century, their tradition, style and influence on later poets.&lt;ref name="creation"/&gt;
[[File:Girish Karnad Screening Cornell.JPG|thumb|right|Kannada play write and Jnanapith awardee, Girish Karnad]]
K. S. Narasimhaswamy continued to be prominent in this era writing such landmark poems as ''Silalate'' ("The Sculptured Creeper", 1958), ''Tereda Bagilu'' ("The Open Door", 1972), ''Malligeya Male'' ("Jasmine Garland", 1986), ''Idadiru Nanna Ninna Simhasanada Mele'' ("Place me not on your Throne") and ''Gadiyaradangadiya Munde'' ("Before the Clock Shop").&lt;ref name="male" /&gt; Among the most well-known of later generation Navya poets are [[Chandrashekhara Kambar]], Chandrashekar Patil, [[P. Lankesh]], and [[K. S. Nissar Ahmed]].&lt;ref name="ahmed"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 185&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:G Adiga.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Modernist poet, Gopalkrishna Adiga (1918 – 1992).]] --&gt;
In the late 1950s, Sri Ranga produced several well-known dramas focussing more on the creator of society (man), in a dramatic style, than on social problems in his ''Kattale Belaku'' ("Darkness and Light", 1959) and ''Kelu Janamejaya'' ("Listen Janamejaya", 1960). In his effort to take his original plays to audiences outside Karnataka, he was helped by theatrical troupes such as the Karnataka Theatre of Bombay, Kannada Amateurs of Dharwad and even well known director-producers such B. V. Karanth.&lt;ref name="dharwad"/&gt;

Other outstanding playwrights from this period are [[Girish Karnad]], P. Lankesh, Chandrashekara Kambar and Chandrashekar Patil. Karnad's ''Tughlaq'' (1964) portrays violence created by idealism gone astray.&lt;ref name="ahmed"/&gt; Considered an important creation in Kannada theatre, the play depicts the 14th century [[Sultan]] of [[Delhi]], [[Mohammad Tughlaq]] in contrasting styles. On one hand the Sultan is a tyrannical and whimsical ruler, and on the other, an idealist who seeks the best for his subjects.&lt;ref name="tug"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4403&lt;/ref&gt; Most plays written by Karnad have either history or mythology as their theme, with a focus on their relevance to modern society.

Kambara's ''Jokumaraswamy'' (1973) is perhaps the most popular amateur play in the language. It presents the conflict between a ruthless power and the popular revolt, leading to the death of the protagonist, the soil tiller. Kambara is best known for his insight and his ability to bring the folk element into his plays.&lt;ref name="soil"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p 1079&lt;/ref&gt; Lankesh's ''Sankranthi'' (1973) brings out the tumultuous events of the late 12th century, during the rise of the Lingayat faith and the struggle of Brahminism in this period. The presentation includes disputations between the saint-poet Basavanna and his patron King Bijalla II.&lt;ref name="saintpoet"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 186&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Tejaswi.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Novelist, Poornachandra Tejaswi (1938 – 2007).]] --&gt;
The Navya novel was launched by Shantinath Desai with his ''Mukti'' (1961) which narrates the protagonist's quest for an independent identity, liberation from his dependence on a friend and his infatuation for the friend's sister.&lt;ref name="saintpoet"/&gt; His second novel, ''Vikshepa'' (1971), tells the story of a village youth from northern Karnataka who attempts to flee from his traditional environment by studying English in Bombay and later flee to England. An English translation was published recently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manyaverlag.de/Vikshepadesai.html ''Shantinath Desai: Vikshepa.''] Translated from the Kannada by Robert Zydenbos. Munich, 2009. {{ISBN|978-3-941196-02-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Veena Shanteshwar]] brings feminine sensibilities to her novels, notable among them being ''Mullugalu'' ("Throns", 1968) and ''Koneya Dari'' ("The Final Choice", 1972)&lt;ref name="heretic"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 187&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the most acclaimed classic in this genre was the ''Samskara'' by [[U.R.Anantha Murthy]] (1965). The novel narrates the search for a new identity and values by the protagonist, a Brahmin, who has sexual intercourse with the untouchable mistress of his [[heresy|heretical]] adversary.&lt;ref name="heretic" /&gt; Another notable work is the ''Swarupa'' (1966) by [[Poornachandra Tejaswi]].

In the genre of short stories, writers who are best known are U. R. Anantha Murthy, Yashwant Chittal, P. Lankesh, Ramachandra Sharma, Shantinath Desai, Rajalakshmi Rao and K.Sadashiva. Anantha Murthy's ''Prasne'' (1963) contains his best collection of short stories including ''Ghatashraddha'', which describes from a boy's point of view the tragedy that befalls a young pregnant widow. His collection ''Mouni'' (1973) includes the stories ''Navilugulu'' ("Peacocks") and ''Clip Joint''. In addition, using his strong background in English literature, Anantha Murthy has made useful contributions as a poet, a playwright and most influentially, as a critic in shaping the direction of modern Kannada criticism.&lt;ref name="dari"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1987), p 165&lt;/ref&gt;

====Navyottara====
From the early 1970s, a change is seen in the output of novels and stories, an anti-Navya reaction by writers, many of whom were themselves Navya writers. This genre, called ''Navyottara'' (post modernist), sought to fulfill a more socially responsible role. Most well known in this form of writing are [[Poornachandra Tejaswi]] and [[Devanur Mahadeva]]. Tejaswi moved away from his initial foray in poetry to writing novels, a move that won him accolades in the form of the "most creative novel of the year" for his ''[[Karvalo]]'' in 1980 and ''Chidambara Rahasya'' in 1985.&lt;ref name="rahasya"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4308&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known short stories are ''Abachurina Post office'' ("The Post Office at Abachur", 1970) narrating the repercussions of setting up a post office at Abachur, ''Kubi mattu Iyala'' which is about a doctor who combats the superstitions of villagers and the ''Tabarana Kathe'' ("Tabara's Story") which decries bureaucracy. Most of his literature is related to nature, conservation and the farmers.&lt;ref name="farmer"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p 4309&lt;/ref&gt; Mahadeva's ''Marikondavaru'' ("Those who sold themselves") and ''Mudala Seemeli Kole Gile Ityadi'' ("Murder in the Eastern Region") effectively portray a realistic account of the life of [[dalit]]s.&lt;ref name="dalit"&gt;Murthy (1992), p 189&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mythopoeic Society''' ('''MythSoc''') is a non-profit organization devoted to the study of [[Mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] literature, particularly the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]], and [[C. S. Lewis]], all members of [[The Inklings]], an informal group of writers who met weekly in C.S. Lewis’ rooms at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], from the early 1930s through late 1949.

== History ==
The Mythopoeic Society was founded in 1967 by [[Glen H. GoodKnight]]. Originally composed of discussion groups based in the [[Los Angeles]] area, it expanded to include organized branches across North America; in 1972 it assimilated the Tolkien Society of America. Membership is open to those who read, study, or write in the genres of myth and fantasy.

== Publications ==
Three periodical publications are produced by the society:
* ''Mythprint'' is a quarterly newsletter with notices of Society activity, book reviews and articles;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mythsoc.org/mythprint/mythprint-history.htm "Mythprint: History and Back Issues"] Mythopoeic Society. Retrieved 2017-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Mythopoeic Society membership includes electronic Mythprint (PDF), also available in print format by subscription.
* ''[[Mythlore]]'', edited by [[Janet Brennan Croft]], publishes peer-reviewed articles on mythic and fantastic works, available by subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LGmdAPdwDgC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Janet+Brennan+Croft&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Fe0SUIL2CfLc4QTdk4CADA&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Janet%20Brennan%20Croft&amp;f=false |title=Die aktuelle Tolkienforschung im Überblick: Personen – Organisationen – Verlage – Werke |trans-title=A Survey of Research on Tolkien: People – Organisations – Publishers – Works |language=German |first=Frank |last=Weinreich |first2=Thomas |last2=Honegger |pages=63–89 |journal=Zeitschrift für Fantastikforschung |year=2011 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Mythic Circle]]'' is a collection of original fiction and poetry, published yearly, available by subscription.

In addition to the periodicals, the society formed [http://www.mythsoc.org/press.htm The Mythopoeic Press] to publish material by and about writers of mythopoeic and fantastic literature, especially focused on The Inklings. Works published include out-of-print materials, collections of short articles and essays, and scholarly items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mythopoeic Press|url=http://www.mythsoc.org/press.htm|publisher=Mythopoeic Society|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The society sponsors local discussion groups throughout the United States and the ''Annual Mythopoeic Conference'', also known as ''Mythcon'', generally held on college or university campuses in various locations, primarily within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon.htm Mythopoeic Conferences] Mythopoeic Society. Retrieved 2017-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Mythcon XX was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1989. Mythcon XXIII was held at Keble College, Oxford, England, in 1992 as part of ''The J.R.R. Tolkien Centenary Conference'', co-sponsored with [[The Tolkien Society]]. Likewise, Mythcon XXXVI in 2005 was held at Aston University, Birmingham, England, combined with ''Tolkien 2005 - 50 Years of The Lord of the Rings'', sponsored by The Tolkien Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon/mythcon-history.htm History of Mythopoeic Conferences] Mythopoeic Society. Retrieved 2017-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythopoeic Awards ==
{{main|Mythopoeic Awards}}
Since 1971 the Mythopoeic Society has bestowed a series of [http://www.mythsoc.org/awards.htm annual awards] to outstanding works. In 1991 the literary award was broken into two categories: the ''Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature'' and the ''Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children’s Literature''.

The ''Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Inklings Studies'' is given to books on J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and/or Charles Williams that make significant contributions to Inklings scholarship. The ''Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Myth and Fantasy Studies'' is given to scholarly books on other specific authors in the Inklings tradition, or to more general works on the genres of myth and fantasy. For the scholarship awards, books first published during the previous three years are eligible, including finalists for previous years.

'''Neoclassicism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] νέος ''nèos'', "new" and [[Latin]] ''classicus'', "of the highest rank")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=neo-classical| title=Etymology of the English word "neo-classical"| accessdate=2016-05-09| publisher=myetymology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to Western [[Cultural movement|movements]] in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theatre, music, and architecture that draw inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of [[classical antiquity]]. Neoclassicism was born largely thanks to the writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], at the time of the rediscovery of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], but its popularity spread all over Europe as a generation of European art students finished their [[Grand Tour]] and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1189&amp;dq=neoclassicism+originated+in.Rome&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCl9eT0cLVAhVLDcAKHSy7B1cQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=neoclassicism%20originated%20in.Rome&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/volltexte/2010/978 The road from Rome to Paris. The birth of a modern Neoclassicism]&lt;/ref&gt; The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]], and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with [[Romanticism]]. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century.

European Neoclassicism in the [[visual art]]s began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant [[Rococo]] style. Rococo architecture emphasizes grace, ornamentation and asymmetry; Neoclassical architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry, which were seen as virtues of the arts of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]], and were more immediately drawn from 16th-century [[Renaissance|Renaissance Classicism]]. Each "neo"-classicism selects some models among the range of possible classics that are available to it, and ignores others. The Neoclassical writers and talkers, patrons and collectors, artists and sculptors of 1765–1830 paid homage to an ''idea'' of the generation of [[Phidias]], but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of [[Late Antiquity]]. The "Rococo" art of ancient [[Palmyra]] came as a revelation, through engravings in Wood's ''The Ruins of Palmyra''. Even Greece was all-but-unvisited, a rough backwater of the [[Ottoman Empire]], dangerous to explore, so Neoclassicists' appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings, which subtly smoothed and regularized, "corrected" and "restored" the monuments of Greece, not always consciously.

Neoclassicism is a revival of the many styles and spirit of classic antiquity inspired directly from the classical period,&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{cite book |title = Neoclassicism A&amp;I (Art and Ideas)| last=Irwin| first=David G.| publisher =  Phaidon Press|year = 1997 | pages = | isbn=978-0-7148-3369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which coincided and reflected the developments in [[philosophy]] and other areas of the Age of  Enlightenment, and was initially a reaction against the excesses of the preceding [[Rococo]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 17-25; Novotny, 21&lt;/ref&gt; While the movement is often described as the opposed counterpart of [[Romanticism]], this is a great over-simplification that tends not to be sustainable when specific artists or works are considered. The case of the supposed main champion of late Neoclassicism, [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], demonstrates this especially well.&lt;ref&gt;A recurring theme in Clark: 19-23, 58-62, 69, 97-98 (on Ingres); Honour, 187-190; Novotny, 86-87&lt;/ref&gt; The revival can be traced to the establishment of formal archaeology.&lt;ref name=Lingo&gt;{{cite book |title = François Duquesnoy and the Greek ideal| last=Lingo| first=Estelle Cecile| publisher = Yale University Press; First Edition|year = 2007| pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wlq67ikF0OEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=Winckelmann+Neoclassicism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zGxFT-GiPMHWiAKY_dypDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Winckelmann%20Neoclassicism&amp;f=false 161]| isbn=978-0-300-12483-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Classical Savannah: fine &amp; decorative arts, 1800-1840| last=Talbott | first=Page| publisher = University of Georgia Press |year = 1995| pages = 6| isbn=978-0-8203-1793-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|left|250|Johann Joachim Winckelmann, often called "the father of archaeology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Culture and values: a survey of the humanities| last=Cunningham, Reich| first= Lawrence S., John J. | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing; 7 edition|year = 2009| pages = 104 | isbn=978-0-495-56877-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] were important in shaping this movement in both architecture and the visual arts. His books ''Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture'' (1750) and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'' ("History of Ancient Art", 1764) were the first to distinguish sharply between Ancient Greek and Roman art, and define periods within Greek art, tracing a trajectory from growth to maturity and then imitation or decadence that continues to have influence to the present day. Winckelmann believed that art should aim at "noble simplicity and calm grandeur",&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 57-62, 61 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; and praised the idealism of Greek art, in which he said we find "not only nature at its most beautiful but also something beyond nature, namely certain ideal forms of its beauty, which, as an ancient interpreter of [[Plato]] teaches us, come from images created by the mind alone". The theory was very far from new in Western art, but his emphasis on close copying of Greek models was: "The only way for us to become great or if this be possible, inimitable, is to imitate the ancients".&lt;ref&gt;Both quotes from the first pages of "Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture"&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the [[Grand Tour]], a fad of collecting [[antiquities]] began that laid the foundations of many great collections spreading a Neoclassical revival throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = In Pursuit of Ancient Pasts: A History of Classical Archaeology in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries| last= Dyson| first=Stephen L.| publisher = Yale University Press |year = 2006| pages = xii | isbn=978-0-300-11097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Neoclassicism" in each art implies a particular canon of a "classical" model.

In English, the term "Neoclassicism" is used primarily of the visual arts; the similar movement in [[English literature]], which began considerably earlier, is called [[Augustan literature]]. This, which had been dominant for several decades, was beginning to decline by the time Neoclassicism in the visual arts became fashionable. Though terms differ, the situation in French literature was similar. In music, the period saw the rise of [[classical music]], and "Neoclassicism" is used of [[Neoclassicism (music)|20th-century developments]]. However, the operas of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] represented a specifically Neoclassical approach, spelt out in his preface to the published score of ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]]'' (1769), which aimed to reform opera by removing [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]], increasing the role of the chorus in line with [[Greek tragedy]], and using simpler unadorned melodic lines.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mengs, Urteil des Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Anton Raphael Mengs]], ''[[Judgement of Paris]]'', c. 1757, bought by [[Catherine the Great]] from the studio]]

The term "Neoclassical" was not invented until the mid-19th century, and at the time the style was described by such terms as "the true style", "reformed" and "revival"; what was regarded as being revived varying considerably. Ancient models were certainly very much involved, but the style could also be regarded as a revival of the [[Renaissance]], and especially in France as a return to the more austere and noble [[Baroque]] of the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], for which a considerable nostalgia had developed as France's dominant military and political position started a serious decline.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 11, 23-25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s coronation portrait of Napoleon even borrowed from Late Antique [[consular diptych]]s and their [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] revival, to the disapproval of critics.

Neoclassicism was strongest in [[architecture]], [[sculpture]] and the [[decorative arts]], where classical models in the same medium were relatively numerous and accessible; examples from ancient painting that demonstrated the qualities that Winckelmann's writing found in sculpture were and are lacking. Winckelmann was involved in the dissemination of knowledge of the first large Roman paintings to be discovered, at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and, like most contemporaries except for [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], was unimpressed by them, citing [[Pliny the Younger]]'s comments on the decline of painting in his period.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 44-46; Novotny, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

As for painting, Greek painting was utterly lost: Neoclassicist painters imaginatively revived it, partly through bas-relief friezes, mosaics and pottery painting, and partly through the examples of painting and decoration of the High Renaissance of [[Raphael]]'s generation, frescos in Nero's ''[[Domus Aurea]]'', [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and through renewed admiration of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. Much "Neoclassical" painting is more classicizing in subject matter than in anything else. A fierce, but often very badly informed, dispute raged for decades over the relative merits of Greek and Roman art, with Winckelmann and his fellow Hellenists generally the winning side.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 43-62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting and printmaking==
[[File:(20) Flaxman Ilias 1795, Zeichnung 1793, 194 x 338 mm.jpg|thumb|Print of a drawing by [[John Flaxman]] of a scene in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', 1795]]

It is hard to recapture the radical and exciting nature of early Neoclassical painting for contemporary audiences; it now strikes even those writers favourably inclined to it as "insipid" and "almost entirely uninteresting to us"—some of [[Kenneth Clark]]'s comments on [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]' ambitious ''Parnassus'' at the [[Villa Albani]],&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 20 (quoted); Honour, 14; [[:File:Mengs Parnasus.jpg|image of the painting]] (in fairness, other works by Mengs are more successful)&lt;/ref&gt; by the artist who his friend Winckelmann described as "the greatest artist of his own, and perhaps of later times".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 31-32 (31 quoted)&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings, subsequently turned into [[old master print|prints]], of [[John Flaxman]] used very simple line drawing (thought to be the purest classical medium&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 113-114&lt;/ref&gt;) and figures mostly in profile to depict ''[[The Odyssey]]'' and other subjects, and once "fired the artistic youth of Europe" but are now "neglected",&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 14&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[history painting]]s of [[Angelica Kauffman]], mainly a portraitist, are described as having "an unctuous softness and tediousness" by [[Fritz Novotny]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 62&lt;/ref&gt;  Rococo frivolity and Baroque movement had been stripped away but many artists struggled to put anything in their place, and in the absence of ancient examples for history painting, other than the [[Ancient Greek pottery|Greek vases]] used by Flaxman, [[Raphael]] tended to be used as a substitute model, as Winckelmann recommended. 
[[File:David-Oath of the Horatii-1784.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacques-Louis David]], ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'', 1784]]

The work of other artists, who could not easily be described as insipid, combined aspects of Romanticism with a generally Neoclassical style, and form part of the history of both movements.  The German-Danish painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]] finished very few of the large mythological works that he planned, leaving mostly drawings and colour studies which often succeed in approaching Winckelmann's prescription of "noble simplicity and calm grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 51-54&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Carstens' unrealized schemes, the [[etching]]s of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] were numerous and profitable, and taken back by those making the [[Grand Tour]] to all parts of Europe. His main subject matter was the buildings and ruins of Rome, and he was more stimulated by the ancient than the modern. The somewhat disquieting atmosphere of many of his ''Vedute'' (views) becomes dominant in his series of 16 prints of ''Carceri d'Invenzione'' ("Imaginary Prisons") whose "oppressive cyclopean architecture" conveys "dreams of fear and frustration".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 45-58 (47-48 quoted); Honour, 50-57&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss-born [[Henry Fuseli|Johann Heinrich Füssli]] spent most of his career in England, and while his fundamental style was based on Neoclassical principles, his subjects and treatment more often reflected the "Gothic" strain of [[Romanticism]], and sought to evoke drama and excitement.

Neoclassicism in painting gained a new sense of direction with the sensational success of [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' at the [[Paris Salon|Paris Salon of 1785]]. Despite its evocation of republican virtues, this was a commission by the royal government, which David insisted on painting in Rome. David managed to combine an idealist style with drama and forcefulness. The central perspective is perpendicular to the picture plane, made more emphatic by the dim arcade behind, against which the heroic figures are disposed as in a [[frieze]], with a hint of the artificial lighting and staging of [[opera]], and the classical colouring of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. David rapidly became the leader of French art, and after the [[French Revolution]] became a politician with control of much government patronage in art. He managed to retain his influence in the [[Napoleon]]ic period, turning to frankly propagandistic works, but had to leave France for exile in Brussels at the [[Bourbon Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 34-37; Clark, 21-26; Novotny, 19-22&lt;/ref&gt;

David's many students included [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], who saw himself as a classicist throughout his long career, despite a mature style that has an equivocal relationship with the main current of Neoclassicism, and many later diversions into [[Orientalism]] and the [[Troubadour style]] that are hard to distinguish from those of his unabashedly Romantic contemporaries, except by the primacy his works always give to drawing. He exhibited at the Salon for over 60 years, from 1802 into the beginnings of [[Impressionism]], but his style, once formed, changed little.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 39-47;Clark, 97-145; Honour, 187-190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==
[[File:Canova-Hebe 30 degree view.jpg|thumb|260px|''Hebe'' by [[Canova]] (1800–05), in the appropriately Neoclassical surroundings of the [[Hermitage Museum]]]]
If Neoclassical painting suffered from a lack of ancient models, Neoclassical sculpture tended to suffer from an excess of them, although examples of actual Greek sculpture of the "classical period" beginning in about 500 BC were then very few; the most highly regarded works were mostly Roman copies.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 378&lt;/ref&gt; The leading Neoclassical sculptors enjoyed huge reputations in their own day, but are now less regarded, with the exception of [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], whose work was mainly portraits, very often as busts, which do not sacrifice a strong impression of the sitter's personality to idealism. His style became more classical as his long career continued, and represents a rather smooth progression from Rococo charm to classical dignity. Unlike some Neoclassical sculptors he did not insist on his sitters wearing Roman dress, or being unclothed. He portrayed most of the great figures of the Enlightenment, and travelled to America to produce a [[George Washington (Houdon)|statue of George Washington]], as well as busts of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]] and other luminaries of the new republic.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 378–379&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chinard, Gilbert, ed., Houdon in America'' Arno PressNy, 1979, a reprint of a book published by Johns Hopkins University, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Canova]] and the Dane [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] were both based in Rome, and as well as portraits produced many ambitious life-size figures and groups; both represented the strongly idealizing tendency in Neoclassical sculpture. Canova has a lightness and grace, where Thorvaldsen is more severe; the difference is exemplified in their respective groups of the ''Three Graces''.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 379-384&lt;/ref&gt; All these, and Flaxman, were still active in the 1820s, and Romanticism was slow to impact sculpture, where versions of Neoclassicism remained the dominant style for most of the 19th century.

An early Neoclassicist in sculpture was the Swede [[Johan Tobias Sergel]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 384-385&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Flaxman]] was also, or mainly, a sculptor, mostly producing severely classical reliefs that are comparable in style to his prints; he also designed and modelled Neoclassical ceramics for [[Josiah Wedgwood]] for several years. [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]] and his son [[Rudolph Schadow|Rudolph]], one of the few Neoclassical sculptors to die young, were the leading German artists,&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 388-389&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Franz Anton von Zauner]] in Austria. The late Baroque Austrian sculptor [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]] turned to Neoclassicism in mid-career, shortly before he appears to have suffered some kind of mental crisis, after which he retired to the country and devoted himself to the highly distinctive "character heads" of bald figures pulling extreme facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 390-392&lt;/ref&gt; Like Piranesi's ''Carceri'', these enjoyed a great revival of interest during the age of [[psychoanalysis]] in the early 20th century. The Dutch Neoclassical sculptor [[Mathieu Kessels]] studied with Thorvaldsen and worked almost exclusively in Rome.

Since prior to the 1830s the United States did not have a sculpture tradition of its own, save in the areas of tombstones, weathervanes and ship figureheads,&lt;ref&gt;Gerdts, William H., ''American Neo-Classic Sculpture: The Marble Resurrection'',  Viking Press, New York, 1973 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; the European Neoclassical manner was adopted there, and it was to hold sway for decades and is exemplified in the sculptures of  [[Horatio Greenough]], [[Hiram Powers]], [[Randolph Rogers]] and [[William Henry Rinehart]].

==Architecture and the decorative arts==

Neoclassicism first gained influence in England and France, through a generation of French art students trained in Rome and influenced by the writings of Winckelmann, and it was quickly adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia. At first, classicizing decor was grafted onto familiar European forms, as in the interiors for [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]'s lover, [[Grigory Orlov|Count Orlov]], designed by an Italian architect with a team of Italian ''[[stucco|stuccadori]]'': only the isolated oval medallions like cameos and the [[bas-relief]] overdoors hint of Neoclassicism; the furnishings are fully Italian Rococo.

A second Neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied (through the medium of [[engraving]]s) and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the [[Napoleon|Napoleonic Empire]]. In France, the first phase of Neoclassicism was expressed in the "Louis XVI style", and the second in the styles called "Directoire" or [[Empire style|Empire]]. The Rococo style remained popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}}

In the decorative arts, Neoclassicism is exemplified in Empire furniture made in Paris, London, New York, Berlin; in [[Biedermeier]] furniture made in Austria; in [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s museums in Berlin, Sir [[John Soane]]'s Bank of England in London and the newly built "[[United States Capitol|capitol]]" in Washington, D.C.; and in [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]]'s [[bas relief]]s and "black basaltes" [[vase]]s. The style was international; Scots architect [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]] created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born [[Catherine II the Great]], in Russian St. Petersburg.

Indoors, Neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s,&lt;ref name="Gontar"&gt;Gontar&lt;/ref&gt; with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of ''[[Le Antichità di Ercolano]]'' (''The Antiquities of Herculaneum''). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicizing interiors of the [[Baroque]], or the most "Roman" rooms of [[William Kent]] were based on [[basilica]] and [[temple]] exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appeatrance to modern eyes: [[pediment]]ed window frames turned into [[gilding|gilded]] mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts. The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary. Techniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low [[frieze]]-like relief or painted in monotones ''[[Camaïeu|en camaïeu]]'' ("like cameos"), isolated medallions or vases or busts or ''[[bucrania]]'' or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of "Pompeiian red" or pale tints, or stone colors. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the ''[[Goût grec]]'' ("Greek style"), not a court style; when [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] acceded to the throne in 1774, [[Marie Antoinette]], his fashion-loving Queen, brought the "Louis XVI" style to court. However, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: "Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 110–111, 110 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Château de Malmaison - Appartement de Joséphine 003.jpg|thumb|[[Château de Malmaison]], 1800, room for the [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Empress Joséphine]], on the cusp between [[Directoire style]] and [[Empire style]]]]

From about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to Neoclassicism, the [[Greek Revival]]. At the same time the [[Empire style]] was a more grandiose wave of Neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of [[Napoleon]] in the [[First French Empire]], where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="Gontar"/&gt; the [[Regency style]] in Britain, and the ''Napoleon style'' in Sweden. According to the art historian [[Hugh Honour]] "so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 171–184, 171 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier phase of the style was called the [[Adam style]] in Great Britain and "Louis Seize", or Louis XVI, in France.

Neoclassicism continued to be a major force in [[academic art]] through the 19th century and beyond—a constant antithesis to [[Romanticism]] or [[Gothic revival]]s —, although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles.{{who|date=March 2013}} The centres of several European cities, notably [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and [[Munich]], came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.

Gothic revival architecture (often linked with the Romantic cultural movement), a style originating in the 18th century which grew in popularity throughout the 19th century, contrasted Neoclassicism. Whilst Neoclassicism was characterized by Greek and Roman-influenced styles, geometric lines and order, Gothic revival architecture placed an emphasis on medieval-looking buildings, often made to have a rustic, "romantic" appearance.

==Neoclassical gardens==
In England, Augustan literature had a direct parallel with the Augustan style of landscape design. The links are clearly seen in the work of [[Alexander Pope]]. The best surviving examples of Neoclassical English gardens are [[Chiswick House]], [[Stowe House]] and [[Stourhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Turner|title=British gardens: history, philosophy and design, Chapter 6 Neoclassical gardens and landscapes 1730-1800|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415518789|pages=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoclassicism and fashion==
[[File:Thérésa Cabarrus.JPG|thumb|Revolutionary socialite [[Thérésa Tallien]]]]
[[File:5th Duke of Bedford.png|thumb|[[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] in a [[Bedford Crop]]]]
In fashion, Neoclassicism influenced the much greater simplicity of women's dresses, and the long-lasting fashion for white, from well before the French Revolution, but it was not until after it that thorough-going attempts to imitate ancient styles became fashionable in France, at least for women. Classical costumes had long been worn by fashionable ladies posing as some figure from Greek or Roman myth in a portrait (in particular there was a rash of such portraits of the young model [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]] from the 1780s), but such costumes were only worn for the portrait sitting and [[masquerade ball]]s until the Revolutionary period, and perhaps, like other exotic styles, as undress at home. But the styles worn in portraits by [[Juliette Récamier]], [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], [[Thérésa Tallien]] and other Parisian trend-setters were for going-out in public as well. Seeing Mme Tallien at the opera, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] quipped that: "''Il n'est pas possible de s'exposer plus somptueusement!''" ("One could not be more sumptuously undressed"). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]] had held a Greek supper where the ladies wore plain white Grecian tunics.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 244&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted, and hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead.

Very light and loose dresses, usually white and often with shockingly bare arms, rose sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice, where there was a strongly emphasized thin hem or tie round the body, often in a different colour. The shape is now often known as the [[Empire silhouette]] although it predates the [[First French Empire]] of Napoleon, but his first Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais was influential in spreading it around Europe. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently laid around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favoured.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 244-245&lt;/ref&gt;  By the start of the 19th century, such styles had spread widely across Europe.

Neoclassical fashion for men was far more problematic, and never really took off other than for hair, where it played an important role in the shorter styles that finally despatched the use of wigs, and then white hair-powder, for younger men. The trouser had been the symbol of the barbarian to the Greeks and Romans, but outside the painter's or, especially, the sculptor's studio, few men were prepared to abandon it. Indeed, the period saw the triumph of the pure trouser, or [[trousers|pantaloon]], over the ''cullottes'' or [[knee-breeches]] of the [[Ancien Régime]]. Even when David designed a new French "national costume" at the request of the government during the height of the Revolutionary enthusiasm for changing everything in 1792, it included fairly tight leggings under a coat that stopped above the knee. A high proportion of well-to-do young men spent much of the key period in military service because of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and military uniform, which began to emphasize jackets that were short at the front, giving a full view of tight-fitting trousers, was often worn when not on duty, and influenced cilivian male styles.

The trouser-problem had been recognised by artists as a barrier to creating contemporary [[history painting]]s; like other elements of contemporary dress they were seen as irredeemably ugly and unheroic by many artists and critics. Various strategems were used to avoid depicting them in modern scenes. In ''[[James Dawkins (antiquarian)|James Dawkins]] and [[Robert Wood (antiquarian)|Robert Wood]] Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758) by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the two gentleman antiquaries are shown in [[toga]]-like Arab robes.  In ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778) by [[John Singleton Copley]], the main figure could plausibly be shown nude, and the composition is such that of the eight other men shown, only one shows a single [[breeches|breeched]] leg prominently.  However the Americans Copley and [[Benjamin West]] led the artists who successfully showed that trousers could be used in heroic scenes, with works like West's ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770) and Copley's ''[[The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781]]'' (1783), although the trouser was still being carefully avoided in ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', completed in 1819.

Classically inspired male hair styles included the [[Bedford Crop]], arguably the precursor of most plain modern male styles, which was invented by the radical politician [[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] as a protest against a [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|tax on hair powder]]; he encouraged his friends to adopt it by betting them they would not. Another influential style (or group of styles) was named by the French "à la Titus" after [[Titus Junius Brutus]] (not in fact the Roman Emperor [[Titus]] as often assumed), with hair short and layered but somewhat piled up on the crown, often with restrained quiffs or locks hanging down; variants are familiar from the hair of both [[Napoleon]] and [[George IV of England]]. The style was supposed to have been introduced by the actor [[François-Joseph Talma]], who upstaged his wigged co-actors when appearing in productions of works such as [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Brutus (tragedy)|Brutus]]'' (about [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who orders the execution of his son Titus).  In 1799 a Parisian fashion magazine reported that even bald men were adopting Titus wigs,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 243&lt;/ref&gt; and the style was also worn by women, the ''[[Journal de Paris]]'' reporting in 1802 that "more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig ''à la Titus''.&lt;ref&gt;Rifelj, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later "Neoclassicisms"==

{{Classicism}}
In American architecture, Neoclassicism was one expression of the [[American Renaissance]] movement, ''ca.'' 1890–1917; its last manifestation was in [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], and its very last, large public projects were the [[Lincoln Memorial]] (highly criticized at the time), the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. (also heavily criticized by the architectural community as being backward thinking and old fashioned in its design), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]]'s Roosevelt Memorial. These were considered stylistic anachronisms when they were finished. In the British Raj, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]' monumental city planning for [[New Delhi]] marks the glorious sunset of Neoclassicism. World War II was to shatter most longing for (and imitation of) mythical, heroic times.

Conservative [[modernist]] architects such as [[Auguste Perret]] in France kept the rhythms and spacing of columnar architecture even in factory buildings. Where a [[colonnade]] would have been decried as "reactionary", a building's [[pilaster]]-like [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] panels under a repeating [[frieze]] looked "progressive". [[Pablo Picasso]] experimented with classicizing motifs in the years immediately following [[World War I]], and the [[Art Deco]] style that came to the fore following the 1925 Paris ''Exposition des Arts Décoratifs'', often drew on Neoclassical motifs without expressing them overtly: severe, blocky [[commode]]s by [[Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann|É.-J. Ruhlmann]] or [[Louis Süe|Süe]] &amp; [[André Mare|Mare]]; crisp, extremely low-relief friezes of damsels and gazelles in every medium; fashionable dresses that were draped or cut on the bias to recreate Grecian lines; the art dance of [[Isadora Duncan]]; the [[Streamline Moderne]] styling of U.S. post offices and county court buildings built as late as 1950; and the [[Dime (United States coin)|Roosevelt dime]].

There was an entire 20th-century movement in the Arts which was also called Neo-classicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy and literature. It was between the end of World War I and the end of World War II. (For information on the musical aspects, see [[20th century classical music#Neoclassicism|20th-century classical music]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]]. For information on the philosophical aspects, see [[Great Books]].)

This literary Neoclassical movement rejected the extreme romanticism of (for example) [[Dada]], in favour of restraint, religion (specifically Christianity) and a reactionary political program. Although the foundations for this movement in [[English literature]] were laid by [[T. E. Hulme]], the most famous Neoclassicists were [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]]. In Russia, the movement crystallized as early as 1910 under the name of [[Acmeism]], with [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Osip Mandelshtam]] as the leading representatives.

===In music===
[[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]] is a 20th-century movement; in this case it is the [[classical music | Classical]] and [[baroque music | Baroque]] musical styles of the 17th and 18th centuries, with their fondness for Greek and Roman themes, that were being revived, not the music of the ancient world itself. (The early 20th century had not yet distinguished the Baroque period in music, on which Neoclassical composers mainly drew, from what we now call the Classical period.) The movement was a reaction  in the first part of the 20th century to the disintegrating chromaticism of late-Romanticism and Impressionism, emerging in parallel with musical Modernism, which sought to abandon key tonality altogether. It manifested a desire for cleanness and simplicity of style, which allowed for quite dissonant paraphrasing of classical procedures, but sought to blow away the cobwebs of Romanticism and the twilit glimmerings of [[Impressionism in music | Impressionism]] in favour of bold rhythms, assertive harmony and clean-cut sectional forms, coinciding with the vogue for reconstructed "classical" dancing and costume in [[ballet]] and [[physical education]]. 

The 17th-18th century dance suite had had a minor revival before [[World War I]] but the Neoclassicists were not altogether happy with unmodified diatonicism, and tended to emphasise the bright dissonance of suspensions and ornaments, the angular qualities of 17th-century modal harmony and the energetic lines of countrapuntal part-writing. [[Respighi, Ottorino | Respighi's]] ''Ancient Airs and Dances'' (1917) led the way for the sort of sound the Neoclassicists aspired to. Although the practice of borrowing musical styles from the past has not been uncommon throughout musical history, art musics have gone through periods where musicians used modern techniques coupled with older forms or harmonies to create new kinds of works. Notable compositional characteristics are: referencing diatonic tonality, conventional forms (dance suites, concerti grossi, sonata forms, etc.), the idea of absolute music untramelled by descriptive or emotive associations, the use of light musical textures, and a conciseness of musical expression. In classical music, this was most notably perceived between the 1920s and the 1950s. [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the best-known composer using this style; he effectively began the musical revolution with his Bach-like [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet for Wind Instruments]] (1923). A particular individual work that represents this style well is [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] No. 1 in D, which is reminiscent of the symphonic style of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. [[Neoclassical ballet]] as innovated by [[George Balanchine]]  de-cluttered the Russian Imperial style in terms of costume, steps and narrative, while also introducing technical innovations.

=== Architecture in Russia and the Soviet Union ===
[[File:Ostdv5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ostankino Palace]], designed by [[Francesco Camporesi]] and completed in 1798, in Moscow, Russia]]
In 1905–1914 Russian architecture passed through a brief but influential period of [[Russian neoclassical revival|Neoclassical revival]]; the trend began with recreation of Empire style of [[Alexander I of Russia|alexandrine]] period and quickly expanded into a variety of neo-[[Renaissance]], [[palladian architecture|palladian]] and modernized, yet recognizably classical schools. They were led by architects born in the 1870s, who reached creative peak before World War I, like [[Ivan Fomin]], [[Vladimir Shchuko]] and [[Ivan Zholtovsky]]. When economy recovered in the 1920s, these architects and their followers continued working in primarily [[modernism (architecture)|modernist]] environment; some (Zholtovsky) strictly followed the classical canon, others (Fomin, Schuko, [[Ilya Golosov]]) developed their own modernized styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft1g5004bj&amp;brand=eschol |title=The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arkhangelskoe Estate Aug2012 buildings 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Arkhangelskoye estate]].]]

With the crackdown on architects' independence and official denial of modernism (1932), demonstrated by the international contest for the [[Palace of Soviets]], Neoclassicism was instantly promoted as one of the choices in [[Stalinist architecture]], although not the only one. It coexisted with moderately modernist architecture of [[Boris Iofan]], bordering with contemporary [[Art Deco]] (Schuko); again, the purest examples of the style were produced by Zholtovsky school that remained an isolated phenomena. The political intervention was a disaster for [[Constructivist architecture|constructivist]] leaders yet was sincerely welcomed by architects of the classical schools.

Neoclassicism was an easy choice for the USSR since it did not rely on modern construction technologies ([[steel frame]] or [[reinforced concrete]]) and could be reproduced in traditional [[masonry]]. Thus the designs of Zholtovsky, Fomin and other old masters were easily replicated in remote towns under strict material [[rationing]]. Improvement of construction technology after World War II permitted Stalinist architects to venture into skyscraper construction, although stylistically these skyscrapers (including "exported" architecture of [[Palace of Culture and Science]], [[Warsaw]] and the [[Shanghai]] International Convention Centre) share little with the classical models. Neoclassicism and neo-Renaissance persisted in less demanding residential and office projects until 1955, when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] put an end to expensive Stalinist architecture.

===Architecture in the 21st century===
{{Main|New Classical Architecture}}
[[File:Schermerhorn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]], 2006]]

After a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), Neoclassicism has seen something of a resurgence.

As of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary Neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of [[New Classical Architecture]]. Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism or Traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arch-tour.blogspot.com/2009/03/neo-classicist-architecture.html Neo-classicist Architecture. Traditionalism. Historicism.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a number of pieces of [[postmodern architecture]] draw inspiration from and include explicit references to Neoclassicism, [[Antigone District]] and the [[National Theatre of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]] among them. [[Postmodern architecture]] occasionally includes historical elements, like columns, capitals or the tympanum.

For sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term [[Vernacular architecture|Traditional Architecture]] (or vernacular) is mostly used. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/ Driehaus Prize for New Classical Architecture at Notre Dame SoA] – ''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''; retained March 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, various contemporary public buildings are built in Neoclassical style, with the 2006 [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]] in [[Nashville]] being an example.

In Britain, a number of architects are active in the Neoclassical style. Examples of their work include two university libraries: [[Quinlan Terry]]'s Maitland Robinson Library at [[Downing College]] and Robert Adam Architects' [[Sackler Library]].

'''Pearson Playwrights' Scheme''' (formerly '''Thames Television Theatre Writers Scheme''') is a British organisation established in 1973 to support theatre writing. It runs the '''Pearson Award for Best New Play'''.

==History==

In 1973, [[Howard Thomas]], then managing director of [[Thames Television]], launched the ''Thames Television Theatre Writers Scheme'' to support and celebrate new writing in the theatre. He believed that television owed much to the theatre for its supply of creative talent. In 1993 [[Pearson PLC]] took over the sponsorship of the scheme and it became the ''Pearson Playwrights' Scheme''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writersservices.com/agent/bur/Pearson_Playwrights.htm ''Pearson Playwrights' Scheme''] writersservices.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shenton's View, [http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/mt/mt-search.cgi?blog_id=2&amp;tag=Pearson%20Playwrights%27%20Scheme&amp;limit=20&amp;IncludeBlogs=2 ''The Nurturing of New Playwrights''] The Stage&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the past 30 years,{{When|date=February 2011}} the scheme has helped launch some of the finest British play-writing talent. Each year, bursaries are awarded to new writers and an additional award is offered to the writer of the best play. These are selected by the scheme's panel, chaired by Sir [[John Mortimer]] CBE QC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/?lid=4432 "Thirty years of the Pearson Playwrights' Scheme"] National Theatre&lt;/ref&gt; The awards are called the Pearson Award for Best New Play.

Since 2014 the scheme has been sponsored by [[Channel Four (United Kingdom)|Channel Four]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/c4-takes-over-pearson-playwrights-scheme-in-its-40th-anniversary-year&lt;/ref&gt;

== Panel and patrons ==

The panel has included [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]], [[Thelma Holt]] CBE, [[Sue Summers]], [[Catherine Johnson (playwright)|Catherine Johnson]], [[Beryl Bainbridge]] DBE and [[John Tydeman]].

Patrons include Sir [[Alan Ayckbourn]] CBE, [[Alan Bleasdale]], [[Stephen Daldry]], Dame [[Judi Dench]], Sir [[Richard Eyre]], Sir [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]] CBE, Sir [[Jeremy Isaacs]], [[Joan Plowright]] CBE, Sir [[Tom Stoppard]] and [[Sue Townsend]].

The scheme is administrated by Jack Andrews MBE, and is supported by The Peggy Ramsay Foundation and The Olivier Foundation.

'''Piratbyrån''' ({{IPA-sv|pɪ²rɑːtbʏˌroːn|lang|Piratbyrån-pronunciation.ogg}} "The Pirate Bureau") was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] organization (or [[think tank]]) established to support the free sharing of information, culture, and [[intellectual property]]. Piratbyrån provided a counterpoint to [[lobby group]]s such as the Swedish [[Svenska antipiratbyrån|Anti-Piracy Bureau]].

In 2005 Piratbyrån released an [[anthology]] entitled ''Copy Me'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Piratbyrån | title=Copy Me - Samlade Texter Från Piratbyrån | year=2005 | language=Swedish | url=https://archive.org/details/CopyMeSamladeTexterFranPiratbyran}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing selected texts previously available from its website. Members of Piratbyrån participated in debates on Swedish Radio and Swedish Television and also gave several lectures in other European countries, such as at the 2005 22nd [[Chaos Communication Congress]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piratbyran.org/index.php?view=articles&amp;id=107| title = Piratbyrån speech at Chaos Communication Congress 22C3 in Berlin|date=December 2005 |author=[[Palle Torsson]] and [[Rasmus Fleischer]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206151626/http://www.piratbyran.org/index.php?view=articles&amp;id=107 |archivedate=6 February 2006 |accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piratbyrån's activities might have changed over the years, partly as a result of the addition of the [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] to the Swedish political scene. During [[Walpurgis Night]] 2007, Piratbyrån burned all of their remaining copies of ''Copy Me'' in a ritual-like performance, declaring:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The file-sharing debate is hereby buried. When we talk about file-sharing from now on it's as one of many ways to copy. We talk about better and worse ways of indexing, archiving and copying—not whether copying is right or wrong. Winter is pouring down the hillside. Make way for spring!&lt;ref&gt;[http://piratbyran.org/walpurgis/ Walpurgis] Piratbyran. Retrieved 16 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jonas Andersson, a Swedish researcher specialized in the politics of [[file-sharing]], gave this brief definition in October 2009:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Piratbyrån is entirely separate from The Pirate Party; it is more of a loosely organised think-tank, a website, a philosophical greenhouse or FAQ guide to digitization.&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, Jonas (13 October 2009). [http://liquidculture.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/qa-re-pirate-politics/ Q&amp;A re Pirate Politics] ''liquidculture notebook'' (Blog).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[MPAA]]-funded Svenska [[Svenska antipiratbyrån|Antipiratbyrån]] (Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau), an agency devoted to fighting copyright infringement, was formed in 2001, before Piratbyrån. Piratbyrån humorously copied the name of their opponent, removing the "anti".&lt;ref name="torrentfreak-disband"&gt;Ernesto (23 June  2010).

In June 2010 the group disbanded following the death of co-founder and prominent member [[Ibrahim Botani]], also known as Ibi Kopimi Botani.&lt;ref name="torrentfreak-disband" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Ibrahim | last=Botani | title=Untitled blog | website=Botanibladet | date=19 June 2008 | url=http://botanibladet.blogspot.nl/2008/06/botanibladets-ppnande.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several former members of Piratbyrån are now involved in [[Telecomix]]. The front page of the website was replaced with the three words {{lang|se|Stängt för eftertanke}} (Swedish for ''Closed for reflection'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.piratbyran.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041001003858/http://www.piratbyran.org/ |archivedate=2004-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-definition==
In 2008 Piratbyrån published a report titled ''Piratbyrån - The Bureau of Piracy Activities 2007''  which starts with the following description of the organisation:

{{quote|Piratbyrån (The Bureau of Piracy) is not an organization, at least not primarily. First and foremost, Piratbyrån is since its beginning in 2003 an ongoing conversation. We are reflecting over questions regarding copying, information infrastructure and digital culture. Within the group, using our own different experiences and skills, as in our daily encounters with other people. These conversations often bring about different kinds of activities.|&lt;ref name="piratbyran.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piratbyran.org/PBverksamhet2007/PB%20activities%202007%20(text%20only).pdf|format=PDF| title = Piratbyrån – The Bureau of Piracy Activities 2007| year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Definition by Prix Ars Electronica jury==
As Piratbyrån received an "award of distinction" at [[Prix Ars Electronica]] in 2009,&lt;ref name="el-oso.net"&gt;oso (9 September 2009). [http://el-oso.net/blog/archives/2009/09/09/ars-electronica-digital-communities-forum/ |Ars Electronica| Communities Forum] El-Oso.net.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aec.at"&gt;[http://www.aec.at/prix_history_en.php?year=2009 History of Prix Ars Electronica / 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025084014/http://aec.at/prix_history_en.php?year=2009 |date=2010-10-25 }} Ars Electronica, 2009. Retrieved 17 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the jury statement said:

{{quote|Piratbyrån is not an organization but an on-going conversation on copyright, file-sharing and digital culture. Over the last six years Piratbyrån has been able to create a discursive space that enables individual and collective actors to be heard, and to significantly expand the range of opinions entering the public debate regarding copyright. To advance this conversation, they have been using a wide range of innovative, experimental, often humorous techniques – as well as traditional means such as public discussions, interviews and publications.

The resulting debate has been multi-layered ranging from the technological (e.g. The Pirate Bay) to the artistic (e.g. a bus tour through Europe to Manifesta 08) to the political (e.g. Pirate Party). With very limited resources, Piratbyrån has been able to galvanize a political movement that has already shaped the development of digital culture and public policy in Sweden and across Europe, pushing the boundaries of the possible.

Piratbyrån aims at nothing less than to fundamentally question the most basic categories – e.g. the distinction between the producer and the consumer – through which we understand culture in order to investigate if and how these apply to the digital condition.

Piratbyrån does not claim to offer a solution to this extremely complex issue; indeed, it questions the assumption that copyright offers a one-size-fits all solution to cultural production, which now needs to be replaced with another unified solution. All of this has been done with great dedication and under considerable personal risk, yet they never forget that humor and irony are among the strongest weapons available to cultural producers.|&lt;ref name="copyriot.se"&gt;Fleischer, Rasmus (17 September 2009).

[[Image:Rasmus Fleischer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rasmus Fleischer]], spokesman of Piratbyrån speaking at a demonstration in [[Stockholm]] held 3 June 2006.]]
Members of Piratbyrån founded the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] tracker [[The Pirate Bay]] in 2003 as a Swedish language site. The Pirate Bay now operates independently from Piratbyrån, although a number of The Pirate Bay administrators were also active in Piratbyrån.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/03/70358 |last=Harrison |first=Ann |title=The Pirate Bay: Here to Stay? |publisher=Wired |date=13 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031053808/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/03/70358 |archivedate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slyck.com/story819_Slyck_Interviews_The_Pirate_Bay| last=Ingram | first=Michael | title=Slyck Interviews The Pirate Bay| publisher=[[Slyck.com]] |date=7 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police raid===
On the morning of 31 May 2006, the servers of both [[The Pirate Bay]], a popular Swedish [[BitTorrent tracker]], and Piratbyrån were confiscated in a raid by Swedish police. The seizure was part of investigation into possible illegal activities on the part of The Pirate Bay. Piratbyrån and the Antipiratbyrån set up a temporary news blog during the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piratbyran.blogspot.com/| title = Piratbyrån Blog |accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.antipiratbyran.com/index.htm?id=news&amp;p=p19#19|title= Antipiratbyrån Blog|accessdate= 25 July 2008|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080806101720/http://www.antipiratbyran.com/index.htm?id=news&amp;p=p19#19|archivedate= 6 August 2008|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities in 2007==
In ''Piratbyrån - The Bureau of Piracy Activities 2007'', published in 2008, Piratbyrån list its activities for the year 2007. Activities by Piratbyrån members include lectures at universities and conferences, the publication of reports, participation in art projects and research projects, an interview with [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] in February 2007, participation in the planning of [[The Oil of the 21st Century]] conference in Berlin, presentations at a Norwegian computer party (The Gathering), interviews to the media regarding the raid on [[The Pirate Bay]], opening of a webshop to sell Kopimi Klothing, participation in the organisation of protests to mark the one-year anniversary of the police raid on [[The Pirate Bay]], attendance of the BELEF07 festival in [[Belgrade]] ([[Serbia]]), and participation in the organisation of a one-day art event in [[Stockholm]] titled "Who Makes And Owns Your Work".&lt;ref name="piratbyran.org"/&gt;

In March 2007 Piratbyrån members were invited to a meeting with the executive group for the [[Swedish Film Institute]], to share their views about film and copying. According to Piratbyrån "The leadership listens with interest — only to some months later launch new anti-piracy initiatives...". In the same month Piratbyrån collaborates with the [[Norway|Norwegian]] group [[Piratgruppen]], launching the counter-campaign "Piracy frees music" (promoted via [[The Pirate Bay]]), in response to the "Piracy kills music" anti-piracy campaign by the Norwegian record industry.&lt;ref name="piratbyran.org"/&gt;

In 2007 members of Piratbyrån also contributed to the production of the film ''[[Steal This Film|Steal This Film (Part Two)]]'', which features interviews with Piratbyrån members and was released in December 2007.&lt;ref name="piratbyran.org"/&gt;

==Activities in 2009==
Piratbyrån organized the "Spectrial", a theatricalizing intervention in [[The Pirate Bay trial]] in Stockholm, early in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trial.thepiratebay.org/ The Pirate Bay Trial website].  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306020910/http://trial.thepiratebay.org/ |date=6 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

At the [[Prix Ars Electronica]] Piratbyrån received an "award of distinction" (including a prize money of 5000 euro) in the category "Digital Communities".&lt;ref name="el-oso.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aec.at"/&gt; The motivation of the jury underlined the Piratbyrån "never forget that humor and irony are among the strongest weapons available to cultural producers." &lt;ref name="copyriot.se"/&gt;

==Kopimi==
{{Multiple image

}}
The '''Kopimi''' symbol, also spelled '''kopimi''', was conceived in January 2005 by Piratbyrån co-founder [[Ibrahim Botani]]. The logo, pronounced "copy me", can be used to specifically request people to copy and distribute a work, for any purpose. Botani intended the logo to be the opposite of copyright, which usually restricts copying a work, and as a unifying symbol of the [[Opposition to copyright|anti-copyright]] ideas Piratbyrån stood for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Rasmus | last=Fleischer | title=Ibi Kopimi Botani | date=23 June 2010 | website=Copyriot | url=http://copyriot.se/2010/06/23/ibi-kopimi-botani/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Kopimi may be considered an [[anti-copyright notice]] of sorts.

Later in 2005, the Kopimi logotype was included in the Piratbyrån book ''Copy Me''.&lt;ref&gt;Piratbyrån (2005). pp. 153, 154, 160, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also put on the front page of [[The Pirate Bay]], where it remains until this day. The history section of the site stated: "''Some of you may have noticed that little symbol at the bottom of the page, the pyramid. It's a symbol called Kopimi (Copy Me) which was founded by an old friend of ours, the artist Ibi Botani. It's basically about promoting copying. Using the kopimi symbol on something not only shows that it is ok to copy it, it says it wants to be copied, mixed or manipulated!''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Unknown | title=History of 2007 | url=http://thepiratebay.org/history/2007 | website=thepiratebay.org | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201011954/http://thepiratebay.org/history/2007 | archive-date=1 February 2009 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Kopimi may appear to be a radical [[List of free content licenses|free content license]], in effect similar to [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|Creative Commons Zero]], no one associated with Piratbyrån ever called Kopimi a license, instead describing it as a symbol of certain ideas. The website of Kopimi contains no terms or legal text. The [[Open Source Initiative]], [[Free Software Foundation]], or any other organisation within the [[open-source movement]], does not list Kopimi as an approved license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Open Source Initiative | title=Licenses by Name | website=Opensource.org | url=http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Free Software Foundation | title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them | website=gnu.org | url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikimedia Commons]], a repository of free content and a sister site of Wikipedia, allows users to label their files with Kopimi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=– | title=Pages that link to "Template:Kopimi" | website=Wikimedia Commons | url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Kopimi&amp;hidelinks=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kopimism===
{{Main article|Missionary Church of Kopimism}}
'''Kopimism''' and '''kopimist(s)''' are terms derived from Botani's symbol. It is unclear who coined them, but they have been used since at least July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=The Pirate Bay | title=TPB announces its support for ACFI against Ladonia | date=25 July 2006 | website=thepiratebay.org | url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog.php?id=34 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323072858/http://thepiratebay.org/blog.php?id=34 | archivedate=23 March 2007 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Unknown | title=How the Kopimists Conquered Internets – and Launched a War | date=25 July 2006 | website=Solidarity with Ladonia!

The Pirate Bay declared: "''To make sure the owners will be kopimistic and that the country won’t be governed by people that do not care about its future, we have come up with a plan. With the help of all the kopimists on Internets, we want to buy Sealand.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=The Pirate Bay | title=Buy Sealand | url=http://buysealand.com/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126211851/http://buysealand.com/ | archivedate=2007-01-26 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Tuan | last=Nguyen | title=PirateBay.org Wants to Be Own Country | website=[[DailyTech]] | url=http://www.dailytech.com/PirateBayorg+Wants+to+Be+Own+Country/article5692.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Missionary Church of Kopimism]] was founded in 2010 by Isak Gerson, a philosophy student and a member of the [[Pirate Party of Sweden]]. After two failed attempts, Kopimism was officially recognized as a religion by the Swedish government in January 2012. The Church considers copying a holy virtue, and uses various Kopimi symbols to present itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Ernesto | title=File-sharing recognized as official religion in Sweden | date=4 January 2012 | website=[[TorrentFreak]] | url=https://torrentfreak.com/file-sharing-recognized-as-official-religion-in-sweden-120104/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Rolle | last=Romig | title=The First Church of Pirate Bay | website=[[The New Yorker]] | date=12 January 2012 | url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-first-church-of-pirate-bay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copie===
[[File:Copie.svg|thumb|150px|Copie logo]]
Inspired by Kopimi, the [[Pirate Party of Brazil]] created their own version of the concept called "Copie", which plays both on the Portuguese words "copie" (meaning copy) and "co-pie" (meaning tweet together). The Copie logo shows 5 birds tweeting together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.partidopirata.org/copie PartidoPirata] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707074649/http://www.partidopirata.org/copie |date=2009-07-07 }} Brazilian Pirate Party website.

[[File:Australian cigarette pack with health warning December 2012.jpg|thumb|Plain cigarette packaging, as required in Australia since 2012: the pack has an [[olive drab]] colour, with the brand name printed in a standard font and size – no logo, other colour or branding allowed.]]

'''Plain tobacco packaging''', also known as '''generic''', '''neutral''', '''standardised''' or '''homogeneous packaging''', refers to packaging that requires the removal of all [[brand]]ing (colours, imagery, corporate logos and [[trademark]]s), permitting manufacturers to print only the brand name in a mandated size, font and place on the pack, in addition to the [[Tobacco packaging warning messages|health warnings]] and any other legally mandated information such as toxic constituents and tax-paid stamps. The appearance of all tobacco packs is standardised, including the colour of the pack.

The removal of branding on [[cigarette pack]]aging aims to deter smoking by removal of positive associations of brands (including design and symbol) with the consumption of tobacco. It also aims to remove an available avenue of [[tobacco advertising|brand advertising]] for cigarette companies.

[[Australia]] was the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging, with all packets sold from 1 December 2012 being sold in logo-free, drab dark brown packaging.  There has been opposition from tobacco companies to plain packaging laws, some of which have sued the Australian government.  Since the Australian government won the court cases, several other countries have enacted plain packaging laws.

Plain packaging was included in guidelines to the WHO [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (WHO FCTC). On 31 May 2016, on [[World No Tobacco Day]], the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] called on governments to get ready for plain packaging of tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World No Tobacco Day 2016: Get Ready for Plain Packaging|url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/10255406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Plain packaging appears to have been first suggested in 1989 by the New Zealand Department of Health’s Toxic Substances Board which recommended that cigarettes be sold only in white packs with black text and no colours or logos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The case for the plain packaging of tobacco products |url=http://www.acosh.org/resources/GenericPackaging.pdf |accessdate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320142534/http://www.acosh.org/resources/GenericPackaging.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public health officials in [[Canada]] developed proposals for plain packaging of tobacco products in 1994. A parliamentary committee reviewed the evidence and concluded that plain packaging could be a “reasonable step in the overall strategy to reduce tobacco consumption”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=_7XprHvrUrAC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=%22reasonable+step+in+the+overall+strategy+to+reduce+tobacco+consumption%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rQNofeKSEc&amp;sig=h8eiPHzIytP0Y08ie9dlKXID2Y8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis3eXa_cLaAhUVT48KHfjfALoQ6AEINTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22reasonable%20step%20in%20the%20overall%20strategy%20to%20reduce%20tobacco%20consumption%22&amp;f=false|title=Smoke &amp; Mirrors: The Canadian Tobacco War|last=Cunningham|first=Rob|date=1996|publisher=IDRC|isbn=9780889367555|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effort did not succeed due to trademark right concerns, specifically those related to Canada's commitments to the [[World Trade Organization]] and under the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=D31VBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=Canada_Standing_Committee_on_Health_Report_-_Toward_Zero_Consumption_Jun_94.pdf&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rOs-hlgaaZ&amp;sig=kHjIAuCgwpNO5DsEryCPL9LcdWo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGra7d-8LaAhXMsI8KHd2CCdcQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Canada_Standing_Committee_on_Health_Report_-_Toward_Zero_Consumption_Jun_94.pdf&amp;f=false|title=Czech Yearbook of International Law - Regulatory Measures and Foreign Trade - 2013|last=Belohlávek|first=Alexander J.|last2=Cerný|first2=Filip|last3=Rozehnalova|first3=Prof JUDr Naděžda|date=2013-04-01|publisher=Juris Publishing, Inc.|isbn=9781578233342|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australia]], with the enactment of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act on 12 December 2011,&lt;ref name=NYT5613 /&gt; became the first country in the world to require tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging. Products manufactured after 1 October 2012, and all on sale after 1 December 2012 must be in the plain packaging.&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cigarette plain packaging laws pass Parliament |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-21/cig-plain-packaging-laws-pass/3684374 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2012C00687|title=Tobacco Plain Packaging Regulations 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Australia's lead (2012) a number of other countries also require standardized packaging including [[France]] (January 2017), [[United Kingdom]] (May 2017), [[New Zealand]] (June 2018), [[Norway]] (July 2018),  [[Ireland]] (September 2018), [[Hungary]] (May 2019) and [[Singapore]] (2020). [[Belgium]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Reuters|title=Slovenia passes law enforcing plain tobacco packaging from 2020|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-slovenia-tobacco-idUKKBN15U2BI]|accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uruguay]] have plain packaging cigarette laws, but are yet to go into effect.

==Evidence==
Only indirect evidence of plain packaging's effectiveness was available until its release in Australia. On 24 May 2011, [[Cancer Council Australia]] released a review of the [[evidence]] supporting the introduction of plain packaging to reduce [[Youth smoking|youth uptake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org.au/Newsmedia/mediareleases/mediareleases2011/24May2011.htm|title=Media releases 2011|author=Cancer Council Australia|work=cancer.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review had been conducted by Quit Victoria and [[Cancer Council Victoria]]. The review includes 24 peer-reviewed studies conducted over two decades, suggesting that packaging plays an important role in encouraging young people to try cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.org.au/content/pdf/CancerControlPolicy/PositionStatements/TCUCCVBkgrndResrchPlainPak270511ReEnd_FINAL_May27.pdf Cancer Council Australia Position Statement], May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; First impressions in Australia indicated that smokers feel that cigarettes taste worse in plain packaging – an unexpected side effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/plain-packaging-leaves-bad-taste-in-smokers-mouths/story-fndo317g-1226527002998 {{Dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/plain-packs-put-off-smokers-20121129-2aitp.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Plain packs 'put off' smokers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, evidence from quantitative studies, qualitative research and the internal documents of the tobacco industry consistently identify packaging as an important part of tobacco promotion.

Plain packaging can change people's attitudes towards smoking and may help reduce the prevalence of smoking, including among minors, and increase attempts to quit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNeill|first1=A|last2=Gravely|first2=S|last3=Hitchman|first3=SC|last4=Bauld|first4=L|last5=Hammond|first5=D|last6=Hartmann-Boyce|first6=J|title=Tobacco packaging design for reducing tobacco use.|journal=[[The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]]|date=27 April 2017|volume=4|pages=CD011244|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011244.pub2|pmid=28447363|laysummary=https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2017/apr/27/standardised-cigarette-packaging-is-on-its-way-but-will-it-reduce-smoking}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diethelm|first1=P|last2=Farley|first2=TM|title=Refuting tobacco-industry funded research: empirical data shows decline in smoking prevalence following introduction of plain packaging in Australia|journal=Tobacco Prevention and Cessation|date=November 2015|volume=1|doi=10.18332/tpc/60650}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diethelm|first1=P|last2=Farley|first2=TM|title=Re-analysing tobacco industry funded research on the effect of plain packaging on minors in Australia: Same data but different results|journal=Tobacco Prevention and Cessation|date=November 2017|volume=3|doi=10.18332/tpc/78508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plain packs also increased behaviours such as hiding or covering the pack, smoking less around others, going without cigarettes and increased thinking about quitting. Almost half of the participants reported that plain packs had either increased the above behaviours or reduced consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A 2013 review found that plain packaging increased the importance of health warnings to consumers.  Plain packaging in a darker colour was associated with more harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stead|first1=Martine|last2=Moodie|first2=Crawford|last3=Angus|first3=Kathryn|last4=Bauld|first4=Linda|last5=McNeill|first5=Ann|last6=Thomas|first6=James|last7=Hastings|first7=Gerard|last8=Hinds|first8=Kate|last9=O'Mara-Eves|first9=Alison|last10=Kwan|first10=Irene|last11=Purves|first11=Richard I.|last12=Bryce|first12=Stuart L.|last13=Middleton|first13=Philippa|title=Is Consumer Response to Plain/Standardised Tobacco Packaging Consistent with Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Guidelines?

Plain packaging with large, graphic, warnings, was considered to impact on [[smoking cessation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mays|first1=Darren|last2=Smith|first2=Collin|last3=Kraemer|first3=John|last4=Johnson|first4=Andrea|title=Plain packaging of cigarettes: do we have sufficient evidence?|journal=Risk Management and Healthcare Policy|date=April 2015|pages=21|doi=10.2147/RMHP.S63042|pmid=25897269|pmc=4396458|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
Advertisement companies and consultants for the tobacco industry expressed concerns that plain cigarette packaging may establish a precedent for application in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://adage.com/article/news/australia-s-cigarette-brand-ban-prompt-domino-effect/236761/ | title = Will Australia’s Cigarette Brand Ban Spread Beyond Borders, Tobacco? | publisher = Advertising Age | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, correspondence between [[Mars, Incorporated]] and the UK Department of Health conveyed concerns that plain packaging could be extended to the food and beverage industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.confectionerynews.com/Regulation-Safety/Mars-complaint-over-tobacco-plain-packaging-unearthed | title = Plain packaging pay out to Mars would ‘certainly not be trivial’ says Institute of Economic Affairs | publisher = Confectionery News | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cityam.com/1406214295/mars-lawyers-slam-tobacco-plain-packaging | title = Mars lawyers slam tobacco plain packaging | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, with other policies such as tobacco taxes, plain packaging is considered by some as a form of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wajsman|first1=Beryl|title=Ottawa's plain packaging cigarette proposal: Illogical, illiberal and illegal - The Métropolitain|url=http://www.themetropolitain.ca/articles/view/1621|accessdate=24 May 2017|work=www.themetropolitain.ca|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lemieux|first1=Pierre|author-link=Pierre Lemieux (economist)|title=The War on Consumer Surplus|journal=[[Regulation (magazine)|Regulation]]|date=2017|volume=40|issue=1|pages=10–13|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/2239e6a142ce187a2379824b37f3893f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=38212|accessdate=24 May 2017|subscription=yes|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study commissioned by [[Philip Morris International]] indicated that plain packaging would shift consumer preferences away from premium towards cheaper brands.&lt;ref&gt;London Economics, [http://londoneconomics.co.uk/Publications/London-Economics-The%20role-of-packaging%20imagery-on-consumer-preferences-for-experience-goods-report%2009-03-2012.pdf "The Role of Packaging Imagery on Consumer Preferences for Experience Goods"], 2012  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812212106/http://londoneconomics.co.uk/Publications/London-Economics-The%20role-of-packaging%20imagery-on-consumer-preferences-for-experience-goods-report%2009-03-2012.pdf |date=12 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tobacco industry also expressed concern that plain packaging would increase the sales of counterfeit cigarettes. Roy Ramm, former commander of Specialist Operations at New Scotland Yard and founding member of The Common Sense Alliance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccotactics.org/index.php/Roy_Ramm|title=Roy Ramm|work=tobaccotactics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a think tank supported by [[British American Tobacco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccotactics.org/index.php/The_Common_Sense_Alliance|title=The Common Sense Alliance|work=tobaccotactics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that it would be "disastrous if the government, by introducing plain-packaging legislation, [removed] the simplest mechanism for the ordinary consumer to tell whether their cigarettes are counterfeit or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/roy-ramm/plain-cigarette-packaging-government-plans-for-plai_b_1637528.html | title = Government Plans for Plain Packaging Will Boost Illicit Trade | publisher = Huffington Post UK | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against plain packaging include its effect on smuggling, its effect on shops and retailers, and its possible illegality. A study published in July 2014 by the [[British Medical Journal]] refuted those claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Scollo|first= Michelle|last2= Zacher|first2= Meghan|last3= Durkin|first3= Sarah|last4= Wakefield|first4= Melanie|date= 18 July 2014|title= Early evidence about the predicted unintended consequences of standardised packaging of tobacco products in Australia: a cross-sectional study of the place of purchase, regular brands and use of illicit tobacco|url= http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/8/e005873.full|journal= [[British Medical Journal]]|doi= 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005873 |accessdate=2 September 2014 |volume=4 |pages=e005873 |pmid=25168041 |pmc=4156805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reporting Philip Morris's legal action against the Australian project, ''[[The Times of India]]'' noted in 2011 that plain packaging legislation was being closely watched by other countries, and that tobacco firms were worried the Australian plain packaging legislation might set a global precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Tobacco-major-sues-Australia-over-plain-packaging-laws/articleshow/10824779.cms |title=Tobacco major sues Australia over 'plain packaging' laws |author=Reuters |date=22 November 2011 |publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

In July 2012 it was reported that the American [[lobbying]] organisation [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC) had launched a worldwide campaign against plain packaging of cigarettes. With the backing of tobacco companies and other corporate interests, it was targeting governments planning to introduce bans on cigarette branding, including the UK and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/15/cigarettes-plain-packets-alec-koch-brothers | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jamie | last=Doward | title=US free market group tries to halt sales of cigarettes in plain packets in UK | date=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco companies were also reported to have provided legal advice and funding to Ukraine and Honduras governments to launch a complaint in the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on the grounds that the Australian legislation is contrary to a WTO intellectual property agreement. WTO complaints must be made by Governments, not companies.&lt;ref name="AFTINET"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aftinet.org.au/cms/node/519 |title= Australian High Court rules against big tobacco on plain packaging |author=AFTINET Media Release&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website= AFTINET Australian Fair Trade &amp; Investment Network Ltd |publisher= |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; British American Tobacco confirmed that they were helping Ukraine meet legal costs in their case against Australia.&lt;ref name="Reuters_Ukraine"&gt;{{cite news|title=UPDATE 1-Ukraine drops WTO action against Australian tobacco-packaging laws|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/03/wto-tobacco-idUSL5N0YP3S420150603|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2015 Ukraine, which exports no tobacco to Australia, decided to suspend its WTO action initiated by the previous Ukrainian government.&lt;ref name="Reuters_Ukraine"/&gt; The packaging of Cuban cigars is considered to contribute significantly to sales.&lt;ref name=NYT5613 /&gt;

In June 2018, the WTO panel rejects the claims of the plaignants. Regarding the [[Agreement on technical barriers to trade]], the panel concludes that plain packaging restricts trade only insofar as it reduces consumption, which is the legitimate objective of the measure. As for the [[TRIPS Agreement]], it observes that "TRIPS does not provide for a right to use a trademark", but prevents other companies from using them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= An initial overview of the WTO panel decision in Australia – Plain Packaging|url= http://untobaccocontrol.org/kh/legal-challenges/initial-overview-wto-panel-decision-australia-plain-packaging/|author= McCabe Centre for Law and Cancer|access-date= 5 July 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tobacco industry response====
In August 2010, [[Philip Morris International]], [[British American Tobacco]] and [[Imperial Tobacco]] formed the Alliance of Australian Retailers, which commenced a multimillion-dollar campaign against the introduction of plain cigarette packaging. The campaign focused on [[grassroots]] advocacy ([[astroturfing]]), ostensibly on behalf of small business owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Big tobacco bankrolls anti-Labor ad campaign |first=Jennifer |last=Macey |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/04/2972779.htm |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the funding source of the campaign was made public, large retailers such as [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] and [[Woolworths (supermarket)|Woolworths]] quickly withdrew support for the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Retail group quits cigarette label campaign |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/11/2979583.htm |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leaks reveal $9m tobacco blitz |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/11/3009026.htm |work=[[Lateline]]|date=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tobacco companies subsequently hired a [[public relations]] firm to oversee the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Tobacco hired public relations firm to lobby government|first=Anne|last=Davies|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/big-tobacco-hired-public-relations-firm-to-lobby-government-20100910-154yg.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, [[British American Tobacco]] launched a media campaign suggesting that illicit trade and crime syndicates would benefit from plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plainpack.com/home.aspx Plain Packs Website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520232024/http://www.plainpack.com/home.aspx |date=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BATA [[CEO]] David Crow threatened to lower cigarette prices in order to compete, which he claimed could result in higher levels of smoking amongst young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tobacco Companies Declare War |url=http://www.abc.net.au/insiders/content/2011/s3223432.htm |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Crow later commented he would tell his own children not to smoke cigarettes, because they are unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=British American Tobacco Australia boss David Crow tells his kids not to smoke |first=Stephen |last=Johnson |url=http://www.news.com.au/business/british-american-tobacco-australia-boss-david-crow-tells-his-children-not-to-smoke/story-e6frfm1i-1226059590411|publisher=news.com.au |date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BATA campaign is largely based on a report from [[Deloitte]]. Several of the claims contained in the report related to border protection, and have since been publicly refuted by customs officials, and the report itself indicated that it had relied extensively on unaudited figures supplied by the tobacco industry itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashaust.org.au/lv4/IllicitChapman1103.htm Professor Simon Chapman]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719094702/http://www.ashaust.org.au/lv4/IllicitChapman1103.htm |date=19 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It's plain to see what's behind the smokescreen |first=Jessica |last=Irvine |url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/its-plain-to-see-whats-behind-the-smokescreen-20110519-1eusy.html|work=[[The Age]]|date=20 May 2011 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, [[Imperial Tobacco]] Australia launched a secondary media campaign, deriding plain packaging legislation as part of a [[Nanny state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Tobacco takes on the nanny state |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/business/9636433/big-tobacco-takes-on-nanny-state/ |publisher=Yahoo Australia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623083821/http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/business/9636433/big-tobacco-takes-on-nanny-state |archivedate=23 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using the provisions in a Hong Kong/Australia treaty to demand compensation for Australia's plain packaging anti-smoking legislation. As a US-based company, Philip Morris could not sue under the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The company rearranged its assets to become a Hong Kong investor in order to use the [[investor-state dispute settlement]] provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT).&lt;ref name="AFTINET"/&gt; Immediately following the passage of legislation on 21 November 2011, Philip Morris announced it had served a notice of arbitration under Australia's Bilateral Investment Treaty with Hong Kong, seeking the suspension on the plain packaging laws and compensation for the loss of trademarks.&lt;ref name="ABC News" /&gt; [[Allens (law firm)|Allens Arthur Robinson]] represented Philip Morris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Philip Morris Begins Arbitration Proceedings With Australia Over Tobacco Packaging Law |url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202533316269&amp;slreturn=1|author=Ben Lewis |publisher=LAW.COM|date=23 November 2011}} {{Dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Health Minister [[Nicola Roxon]] stated that she believed the government was "on very strong ground" legally, and that the government was willing to defend the measures.&lt;ref name=ABC6Jul2011 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mccabecentre.org/focus-areas/tobacco/philip-morris-asia-challenge|title = Philip Morris Asia Challenge under Australia – Hong Kong Bilateral Investment Treaty|accessdate = 2014-12-05|publisher = McCabe Centre for Law and Cancer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continuance of trade and investment proceedings on the issue has been described as an affront to the rule of law in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA.

In November 2011, British American Tobacco announced that it would challenge the laws in the High Court as soon as they gained royal assent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plain cigarette packaging to start in 2012|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/plain-cigarette-packaging-to-start-in-2012-20111121-1nqbo.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, the High Court ruled in favour of the Australian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=JT International SA v Commonwealth |court=HCA |num=43 |year=2012 |parallelcite=(2011) 250 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 [http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2012/projt-2012-08-15.pdf judgement summary] at High Court of Australia Website.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British American Tobacco placed [[freedom of information]] requests on a Cancer Institute NSW research survey of school students aged between 12-17, which asked how they react to plain packaging, where they get cigarettes from and what age they started smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/tobacco-company-wants-schools-survey-for-insights-into-children-and-teens-20150819-gj2vto.html|title=Tobacco company wants schools survey for insights into children and teens|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-20/cancer-council-fights-tobacco-giant-foi-bid-for-info-on-smoking/6710884|title=Cancer Council to fight British American Tobacco's FOI bid for students' smoking attitudes research|work=ABC News|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cancer Council Victoria]] fought the FOI request, saying that the tobacco company wanted to use the survey information to change their marketing to children to increase cigarette smoking among youth.

Phillip Morris was ordered to pay the Australian government's legal fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knaus |first1=Christopher |title=Philip Morris cigarettes charged millions after losing plain packaging case against Australia |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/10/philip-morris-cigarettes-charged-millions-after-losing-plain-packaging-case-against-australia |accessdate=1 July 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=10 July 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A FOI request by [[Nick Xenophon]] and [[Rex Patrick]] revealed that Australia's legal fees amounted to $39 million with Patrick saying that this showed the dangers of investor-state dispute settlement clauses allowing companies to sue governments in the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hutchens |first1=Gareth |last2=Knaus |first2=Christopher |title=Revealed: $39m cost of defending Australia's tobacco plain packaging laws |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/02/revealed-39m-cost-of-defending-australias-tobacco-plain-packaging-laws |accessdate=1 July 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=1 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other responses====
The [[World Health Organization]] applauded Australia’s law on plain packaging noting that “the legislation sets a new global standard for the control of a product that accounts for nearly 6 million deaths each year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/press_releases/pr_20111123.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20111124102118/http%3A//www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/press_releases/pr_20111123.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 November 2011 |title=WHO applauds Australia's new tobacco packaging legislation |author= |date=23 November 2011 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=15 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cancer Council of Australia hailed the passing of the legislation, stating, "Documents obtained from the tobacco industry show how much the tobacco companies rely on pack design to attract new smokers....You only have to look at how desperate the tobacco companies are to stop plain packaging, for confirmation that pack design is seen as critical to sales."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org.au//Newsmedia/mediareleases/mediareleases2011/21November2011.htm |title=Great day in public health, as parliament signs off on tobacco packaging bills |author=Paul Grogan |date=21 November 2011|publisher=Cancer Council, Australia |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization's director for the Western Pacific also congratulated Australia and stated that all countries and areas in the Western Pacific should follow Australia's good example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=6670 |title=WHO Applauds Australia's New Tobacco Packaging Legislation |author=World Health Organization |date=23 November 2011|work=Solomon Times Online |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking on Radio Australia, Don Rothwell, Professor of International Law at the [[Australian National University]], noted that Philip Morris was pursuing multiple legal avenues. The Notice of Arbitration under the bilateral investment treaty between Hong Kong and Australia has a 90-day cooling off period after which the case would most likely be sent to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in Washington. He stated that Philip Morris was most likely aiming for the Australian Government to back down, or failing that, to sue for compensation. He said the questions to decide are whether the legislation means that Australia would acquire property by the imposition of these rules and if this legislation is a legitimate public-health measure.

Professor Rothwell noted "...the growing recognition of the legitimacy of public health measures of this type." Professor Rothwell estimated that the legal cases, including any case before the High Court, would take up to a year to decide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/asiapac/stories/201111/s3373582.htm|title=Australia sued over cigarette plain packaging laws |date=22 November 2011|publisher=ABC International Radio Australia|accessdate= 26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States, Judge Richard J. Leon ruled in 2011 that graphic health warning labels "clearly display the government’s opinion on smoking" which he said "cannot constitutionally be required to appear on the merchandise of private companies." He ruled that these warnings would unfairly hurt their sales, that the warnings were crafted to provoke an emotional response calculated to quit smoking or never to start smoking. This, the judge ruled, was "an objective wholly apart from disseminating purely factual and uncontroversial information." This finding may be appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bpr.berkeley.edu/2011/11/federal-judge-deems-fda’s-antismoking-warning-labels-unconstitutional/ |title=Federal Judge Deems FDA's Antismoking Warning Labels Unconstitutional |author=Mandy Honeychurch |date=8 November 2011 |work=Berkeley Political Review |accessdate=26 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710004624/http://bpr.berkeley.edu/2011/11/federal-judge-deems-fda%E2%80%99s-antismoking-warning-labels-unconstitutional/ |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57320454-10391704/fdas-graphic-cigarette-warning-labels-beyond-free-speech/ |title=FDA's graphic cigarette warning labels: Beyond free speech? |author=Ryan Jaslow |date=8 November 2011|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=June 2017}}

The Associated Press noted that Philip Morris took "less than an hour" to launch legal action against the Australian legislation. It also stated that Australian legislation followed the lead of Uruguay which requires that 80 per cent of cigarette packages is devoted to warnings and Brazil, where cigarette packages display "graphic images" of dead fetuses, haemorrhaging brains and gangrenous feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/industries/tobacco-giant-philip-morris-suing-australian-government-over-plain-packaging-law/2011/11/21/gIQA0sE4gN_story.html |title=Australia passes no-logo cigarette package law; Philip Morris quickly takes legal action |author=Associated Press |date=21 November 2011|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=23 November 2011}} {{Dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavin Allen of the ''Daily Mail'' newspaper reported that the Philip Morris lawsuit could cost the Australian government "billions". He also noted that the Australian law is being closely watched by other governments in Europe, Canada and New Zealand. In 2005, the World Health Organization urged countries to consider plain packaging, and noted that [[Bhutan]] had banned the sale of tobacco earlier in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2064314/Philip-Morris-challenges-Australian-law-plain-tobacco-packaging.html|title=Cigarette giant Philip Morris sues Australian government for billions over plain packaging law |author=Gavin Allen |date=22 November 2011|work=The Daily Mail|accessdate=23 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand Associate Health Minister [[Tariana Turia]] congratulated the Australian Health Minister, noted that tobacco labelling rules have long been harmonised between Australia and New Zealand, and looked forward to New Zealand following suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-11/22/c_131262227.htm|title=New Zealand to follow Australia's controversial plain packaging law for cigarettes |date= 22 November 2011|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate= 26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, [[Nicola Roxon|Minister Roxon]] released an exposure draft of plain packaging legislation with an expected start date of 1 July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exposure Draft, Plain Packaging Bill|first=Nicola|last=Roxon|authorlink=Nicola Roxon|url=http://yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/C550AA264BA53F7ACA25786B0001B34A/$File/Tobacco%20Plain%20Packaging%20Bill%202011%20-%20Exposure%20Draft%20-%2031%20March%202011.pdf|publisher=Australian Government|date=April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603020321/http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/C550AA264BA53F7ACA25786B0001B34A/$File/Tobacco%20Plain%20Packaging%20Bill%202011%20-%20Exposure%20Draft%20-%2031%20March%202011.pdf|archivedate=3 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian newspapers reported that the legislation was likely to pass despite concerns from the [[Coalition (Australia)|Opposition]]. It was suggested the Opposition resistance to the legislation was due to their continuing acceptance of funding donations from tobacco companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cigarettes Likely to get plain packages |first=Andrea |last=Hayward |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/cigarettes-likely-to-get-plain-packages-20110524-1f193.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
In March 2015, an early day motion forwarded by deputy [[Catherine Fonck]] to consider plain packaging in Belgium. However, it was opposed and stuck down by the federal Public Health select committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les partis de la majorité rejettent le paquet de cigarettes neutre|trans-title=The majority parties reject neutral packaging of cigarettes|language=French|url = http://www.levif.be/actualite/belgique/les-partis-de-la-majorite-rejettent-le-paquet-de-cigarettes-neutre/article-normal-373219.html|website=[[Le Vif]]|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in November 2016, the health minister [[Maggie De Block]] said she is open to idea of plain packaging, once the introduction of plain packaging in France and the UK has been reviewed.

===Canada===
In 2011, Health Canada introduced changes to the tobacco products labelling regulations that included sixteen new graphic health warnings covering 75% of the principal faces of cigarette and cigarillo packages. As of September 2015, Health Canada is not planning regulatory action that would require plain or standardised packaging of tobacco products. The department considers its commitment to introduce health-related labelling requirements on cigarettes and cigarillos fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Health Canada Controlled Substances and Tobacco Directorate (personal communication, 9 September 2015) {{original research inline|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early-October 2015, the Liberal Political Party leader, [[Justin Trudeau]], announced that he would include the introduction of plain tobacco packaging as part of his platform, under the heading of Healthier Kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberal.ca/realchange/healthier-kids/|title= Healthier kids|publisher=|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has received positive feedback from cancer advocacy groups, including the Canadian Cancer Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.ca/en/about-us/for-media/media-releases/national/2015/plain-packaging-proposal/?region=on|title=Society welcomes commitment to tobacco plain packaging|work=www.cancer.ca|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since become the Prime Minister and has told his then-Health Minister, [[Jane Philpott]], that he expects her to "Introduce plain packaging requirements for tobacco products, similar to those in Australia and the United Kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister-health-mandate-letter|title= Minister of Health Mandate Letter|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
In March 2015, a bill similar to the Australian one was established before the Congress of the Republic, since it was intended to regulate the packaging and labeling of tobacco products. The ultimate goal of this Bill was to achieve a total ban on its advertising, promotion and sponsorship. Although the Bill was filed a few months after the passage of the legislature, the one that has come to be debated in the first presentation in the House of Representatives allows concluding that Colombia is not far from adopting a regulation on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The arrival of Plain Packaging to Colombia |url=https://www.asuntoslegales.com.co/consultorio/la-llegada-del-plain-packaging-a-colombia-2611247 |publisher=[[Asuntos Legales]]|date=16 March 2016|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The directive adopted April 3, 2014 explicitly states that 28 EU countries have the option of implementing plain packaging, a provision upheld on May 4, 2016 by the [[European Court of Justice]] as valid when dismissing a tobacco industry legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30ddfe90e0aea11f458dbae3c7bf29452f35.e34KaxiLc3qMb40Rch0SaxuSahr0?text=&amp;docid=173256&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=493911|title=Case C‑547/14: Philip Morris Brands SARL and Others}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In December 2010, a [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] member of the French Parliament tabled a Member's Bill aimed at creating plain cigarette packaging. However, the bill did not pass despite ongoing support from health associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tabac: la Ligue contre le cancer veut des paquets de cigarettes "neutres" |trans-title=Tobacco: the league against cancer wants "neutral" packets of cigarettes |language=French |url=http://lci.tf1.fr/filnews/science/tabac-la-ligue-contre-le-cancer-veut-des-paquets-de-cigarettes-6968916.html |publisher=LCI, TF1 |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212130556/http://lci.tf1.fr/filnews/science/tabac-la-ligue-contre-le-cancer-veut-des-paquets-de-cigarettes-6968916.html |archivedate=12 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other countries, there was fierce protest from the tobacco industry and tobacco retailers associations. The Health Minister also seemed lukewarm in his support, preferring to see the effect of newly-introduced health warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Plain cigarette packets considered |url=http://www.connexionfrance.com/plain-cigarette-packets-smoking-draft-law-logos-colours-banned-shock-images-view-article.html |publisher=The Connection|date=11 August 2010|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the next legislature however, the new [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] Health Minister, [[Marisol Touraine]], said she would fight especially at the European level for "neutral packaging". As in Australia, the tobacco industry countered that generic packaging would be easy to counterfeit, which would increase illegal cigarette sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le gouvernement favorable à des "cigarettes neutres" |trans-title= The government is favourable towards "neutral cigarettes" |language=French |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sante/article/2012/07/31/le-gouvernement-favorable-a-des-paquets-de-cigarettes-neutres_1740749_1651302.html |work=[[Le Monde]]|date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU directive eventually contained no explicit measures regarding plain packaging. In reaction, the French government announced the introduction of a bill containing provisions for generic cigarette packaging on 25 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Encadrement du vapotage, mise en place du paquet " neutre " : les annonces du plan anti-tabac |trans-title=Supervision of vaping, implementation of the "neutral" packet: announcements of the plan against tobacco |language=French|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sante/article/2014/09/25/encadrement-du-vapotage-mise-en-place-du-paquet-neutre-les-annonces-du-plan-anti-tabac_4494262_1651302.html|work=Le Monde|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was passed on 17 December 2015. The tobacco industry promptly attacked it in court, but lost its case.
This legislation was upheld on 21 January 2016 as constitutional by France’s [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/acces-par-date/decisions-depuis-1959/2016/2015-727-dc/decision-n-2015-727-dc-du-21-janvier-2016.146887.html|title=Décision n° 2015-727 DC du 21 janvier 2016 sur la loi de modernisation du système de santé}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cigarettes manufactured after 20 May 2016 or sold after 1 January 2017 must be put in plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La France adopte le paquet de cigarettes neutre|trans-title=France adopts neutral cigarette packaging|language=French|url=http://www.lesoir.be/1072520/article/actualite/fil-info/fil-info-monde/2015-12-17/france-adopte-paquet-cigarettes-neutre|date=17 December 2015}} {{Dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
The Decree of 16 August 2016 requires that new cigarette and tobacco brands that will be introduced on the Hungarian market after 20 August 2016 has to be in a uniform plain packaging, void of brand logos. Eventually, all cigarette and tobacco products are to be sold in uniform packs from 20 May 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hungary: Larger pictorial warnings and plain packaging required by the new Government Decree|url=http://apps.who.int/fctc/implementation/database/groups/hungary-larger-pictorial-warnings-and-plain-packaging-required-new-government-decree}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2017, the first cigarettes with unified plain packaging hit the Hungarian market. From 20 August 2016 onwards, new brands have to be sold in plain packaging, one new cigarette brand of Von Eicken GmbH was forced to be launched with such unified package. This makes Hungary the fourth country in the world, where plain packaging is enforced; after Australia, France and the UK.

===India===
As of August 2012, India is believed to be considering plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/business/tobacco-fight-not-over-phillip-morris-says-20120815-2488s.html "Tobacco fight not over, Phillip Morris says"], by Chris Zappone, ''[[The Age]]'', 15 August 2012.

The bill seeks amendment to the original act from 2003 to stipulate for plain packaging of cigarette and tobacco products in the country and increase the size of health warning and the accompanying graphic on cigarette packets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/generalnews/news/bill-submitted-in-lok-sabha-for-amending-tobacco-act-2003/56442/ "Bill submitted in Lok Sabha for amending tobacco act 2003"], ''[[Business Standard]]'', 14 September 2012. Accessed 10 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, there has been no progress on this matter and tobacco continues to be sold in branded packaging.

===Ireland===
In May 2013, Ireland announced plans to become the second country in the world to introduce plain cigarette packaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dohc.ie/press/releases/2013/20130528.html "Ireland set to become second country in the world to introduce plain pack cigarettes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222055922/http://www.dohc.ie/press/releases/2013/20130528.html |date=22 February 2014 }}, by Ireland's DoHC, 28 May 2013. Accessed 28 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, the Irish government said it would legislate to implement plain packaging. Details of the bill known as the ''Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014'' were published on 10 June 2014. "There is a wealth of international evidence on the effects of tobacco packaging in general and on perceptions and reactions to standardised packaging which support the introduction of this measure," Ireland's [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Health Minister]] [[James Reilly (Irish politician)|James Reilly]] said when releasing details of the bill.&lt;ref name="IrishPackagingBan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ireland to become first country in Europe to restrict tobacco companies on packaging|url=http://www.irishsun.com/index.php/sid/222782481/scat/aba4168066a10b8d/ht/Ireland-to-become-first-country-in-Europe-to-restrict-tobacco-companies-on-packaging|accessdate=10 June 2014|publisher=''Irish Sun.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed by [[President of Ireland|President]] [[Michael D.

After some delays, it was announced that the law would take effect on 30 September 2017, with the sale of previously-manufactured cigarettes allowed until 30 September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plain packaging for cigarettes to begin in September|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/plain-packaging-for-cigarettes-to-begin-in-september-1.3028834|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia ===
On 24 February 2016, the [[Malaysia]]n [[Ministry of Health (Malaysia)|health ministry]] announced that it is planning to follow Australia's example and introduce plain packaging for tobacco in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gov’t plans to introduce plain packaging for tobacco|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2016/02/24/govt-plans-to-introduce-plain-packaging-for-tobacco/|accessdate=1 April 2016|work=Free Malaysia News|date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysia faces fight over plain tobacco packaging|url=http://english.cntv.cn/2016/03/15/VIDEmUynjaejCUujnTHCO37q160315.shtml|work=CCTV.com English|date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, [[Paul Blokhuis]], serving as [[Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (Netherlands)|State Secretary for Health, Welfare and Sports]] in the [[Third Rutte cabinet]] plans to have plain packaging law by 2020&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/2499077/plan-staatssecretaris-blokhuis-sigarettenpakjes-krijgen-neutrale-kleur De Telegraaf: Sigarettenpakjes krijgen neutrale kleur]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand requires tobacco products to be standardised in a similar manner to Australian requirements. Legislation and associated regulations to enable standardised packaging of tobacco products came into force on 14 March 2018.&lt;ref name= "NZ Parliament"&gt;New Zealand Parliament.

Discussion of the need for standardised packaging (formerly called plain packaging), the passage of the legislation through Parliament, and its subsequent coming into force took six years. In April 2012, following an inquiry by the Māori Affairs Select Committee, Government (on recommendation of the then Associate Minister of Health, Dame [[Tariana Turia]]) approved plain packaging in principle, a move that tobacco companies said they would strenuously oppose.&lt;ref&gt;Otago Daily Times.

===Norway===
In August 2012, it was believed that Norway began considering plain packaging.&lt;ref name="theage.com.au"&gt;{{cite news|last = Zappone|first = Chris|title = Tobacco fight not over, Phillip Morris says|url = http://www.theage.com.au/business/tobacco-fight-not-over-phillip-morris-says-20120815-2488s.html#poll|accessdate = 2012-08-15|newspaper = The Age|date = 2012-08-15|location = Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 31 May 2016 on [[World No Tobacco Day]], the Health Minister [[Bent Høie]] announced the introduction of plain packaging to Norway by 2017.

In December 2016, the [[Norwegian Parliament]] voted overwhelmingly in favour of implementing standardised packaging for tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norway adopts standardised packaging|url=http://www.uicc.org/norway-adopts-standardised-packaging-save-lives-and-prevent-suffering-tobacco-use}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure was introduced at the same time as the EU Tobacco Products Directive measures on packaging and labelling, taking effect on 1 July 2017. Retailers were given one year (until 1 July 2018) to transition to the new standardised cigarette packages and smokeless tobacco boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''Norway'' Tobacco labelling Resource Centre|url=http://www.tobaccolabels.ca/countries/norway/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panama===
Since 2017, the National Assembly has discussed draft Law 136 on plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panama advocates neutral packaging of cigarettes |url=https://www.prensa.com/salud_y_ciencia/Panama-aboga-empaquetado-neutro-cigarrillo_0_4502549836.html |publisher=[[La Prensa (Panama City)|La Prensa]]|date=10 June 2016|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill proposes that the color of the packs be dark matt gray and that the mark be presented in white Arial font, size 20, highlighted in bold. Panama ranks second in having the lowest prevalence in the world of consumption, since only 6.4% of adults in the isthmus smoke.

===Philippines===
Anti-smoking group New Vois Association of the Philippines favored the introduction of plain cigarette packaging in the Philippines as part of their campaign on the 2016 [[World No Tobacco Day]] and urged then-presumptive president [[Rodrigo Duterte]] to implement a law to standardize cigarette packs. The [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] (DOH), however, is not ready to implement plain cigarette packaging, and rather focus on enforcing [[Tobacco packaging warning message|graphic health warnings]] on cigarette packs under the Graphic Health Warning Act of 2014 that took effect in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-smoking group urges Duterte to adopt plain-packed cigarettes|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2016/05/30/anti-smoking-group-urges-duterte-adopt-plain-packed-cigarettes-476525|newspaper=[[Sun.Star]]|date=30 May 2016|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 15 February 2017, the [[Parliament of Slovenia]] passed a law for the introduction of plain packaging from 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovenia passes law enforcing plain tobacco packaging from 2020|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-slovenia-tobacco-idUSKBN15U2BI|website=Reuters|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland === 
On 5 December 2014, [[National Council (Switzerland)|Swiss parliamentarian]] Pierre-Alain Fridez tabled a motion for plain packaging in Switzerland. A few days later, [[Federal Council of Switzerland|the Federal Council]] said it was opposed to this, saying such a measure "goes too far".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lematin.ch/suisse/Le-Conseil-federal-s-oppose-aux-paquets-de-cigarettes-neutres/story/31905395|title=Le Conseil fédéral s'oppose aux paquets de cigarettes neutres|trans-title=The Federal Council opposes neutral packets of cigarettes|language=French|work= [[Le Matin (Switzerland)|Le Matin]]|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
In September 2011, ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' reported that the Turkish government was working on plain packaging regulations. An Istanbul-based newspaper, ''[[Milliyet]]'', reported that under the proposal all branding elements would disappear and cigarettes would come in "numbered black boxes" excluding any imagery other than health warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey Working on Cigarette Branding Ban Law, Milliyet Says |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-07/turkey-working-on-cigarette-branding-ban-law-milliyet-says.html |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=7 September 2011|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Health Minister [[Recep Akdağ]] stated that Turkey will "introduce plain packaging where the brand of cigarettes will almost be invisible and sellers will be obliged to store the cigarettes in closed cases instead of transparent displays" in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New restrictions on cigarette sales in the works|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/2016/11/15/new-restrictions-on-cigarette-sales-in-the-works|website=The Daily Sabah|accessdate=21 April 2017|location=Ankara, Turkey|date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In November 2013, the UK Government announced an independent review of cigarette packaging in the UK, amid calls for action to discourage young smokers.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |title=Cigarette packaging: Ministers launch fresh review |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25126673|accessdate=28 November 2013 | work=BBC News |date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public Health Minister Jane Ellison rejected [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] calls for immediate regulation rather than a review, saying: "It's a year this weekend since the legislation was introduced in Australia. It's the right time to ask people to look at this."

The "Plain Packs Protect" campaign by an alliance of health organisations set out the case for tobacco plain packaging in the UK, as did Cancer Research UK's "The Answer Is Plain" campaign, which was launched soon after the government consultation was announced. Opposing this was the smokers' rights group [[FOREST]], which launched a counter-campaign titled "Hands Off Our Packs".&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

In March 2015, the House of Commons voted 367–113 in favour of introducing plain cigarette packaging. Plain packaging is required for cigarettes manufactured after 20 May 2016 or sold after 21 May 2017.&lt;ref name="UK-vote"&gt;{{cite news|title=MPs pass legislation to introduce standardised cigarette packaging|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/11/mps-pass-legislation-introduce-standardised-cigarette-packaging|date=11 March 2015|accessdate=29 March 2015|publisher=''The Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Government Legislation: The Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations 2015|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/829/contents/made|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK regulations forbid "logos or promotional images … inserts … discounts … offers … information about nicotine, tar or carbon monoxide … lifestyle or environmental benefits [and] mentions or depictions of taste, smell or the absence thereof", while mandating "drab dark brown coloured packaging", specific package shapes and a specific font (Helvetica 14-point) for brand names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Government: Guidance: Packaging of tobacco products|accessdate=29 October 2018|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/packaging-of-tobacco-products}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK is also bound by the EU's Tobacco Products Directive (2014) which included a requirement for combined health warnings (picture, text and information on how to stop) covering 65 per cent of both the front and back of packaging.&lt;ref name=EU2014 /&gt;

'''Design standards''', '''reference standards''' and '''performance standards''' are familiar throughout business and industry, virtually for anything that is definable.  [[Sustainable design]], taken as reducing our impact on the earth and making things better at the same time, is in the process of becoming defined.   There are also lots of well organized specific methodologies that are used by different communities of people for different purposes.

== Design standards ==
One of the better known is the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) green building rating system, which uses a diverse group of hard measures of environmental quality and impacts to define a holistic approach to sustainable building and assign ratings to individual projects.

Sustainable design is really just a more determined effort to consider the whole range of impacts on our environment in making any decision. A more complete design guide, guided more by whole project impact measures, is the model offered by the U.S. cooperating agencies in the [http://www.wbdg.org/ "Whole Building Design Guide"].

Green construction codes and standards are beginning to emerge on the national code stage. The standards go beyond energy standards such as [[ASHRAE 90.1]] and the [[International Energy Conservation Code]] (IECC) to cover additional areas such as site sustainability, [[water efficiency]], indoor [[environmental quality]] and materials and resources. The first is [[ASHRAE 189.1]], Standard for the Design of High-Performance, Green Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings, published by ASHRAE in January 2010 in conjunction with the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] and the [[Illuminating Engineering Society]]. Standard 189.1 provides criteria by which a building can be judged as “green,” written in model code language that jurisdictions can use to develop a green building construction code.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Several organizations have developed their own ways of setting goals for energy reductions, such as [[Architecture 2030]] and for qualifying performance toward them such as [[Cradle to Cradle Design|Cradle to Cradle]].

== Design methods ==
Developing real methods for how to discover the design opportunities that would allow you to meet or exceed the standards was one of the objectives of the environmental design movement in architectural schools in the 1960s and '70s, but though some of the issues introduced then are still an important part of the process, not much actually changed about the methods of design.  Now with the combination of many more interactive tools and much higher stakes in the outcome, and long gestating rethinking about natural systems in general, a dramatic new revolution in methodology seems inevitable.

BIM (building information modeling) allows designers to work with many remote consultants on the same data file that represents all the decisions being made by the team.  That same file is available to the [[climate and energy]] and environmental impact analysis and cost analysis tools and consultants, ... and of course to the prospective contractors and the regulators.   Along with this new integrated access to the model there in needed a new way to integrate the conversation of so many people, each with some interest in reviewing each other's comments on the progress with the central design model.  That is likely to involve development of wiki tools for the process.  One such very early impliementation of a Wiki SD tool called [https://web.archive.org/web/20081007000010/http://www.connection.metadot.net/ "4Dsustainability"] organizes the project design evolution around the general learning process of '''how you define the problem''' by exploring its environment, and following that through the project.

The main difference between sustainable design methods and conventional design is incorporating the entire environment of the project's stakeholders on the design team, essentially, and that calls for new ways to explore connections and for more people and perspectives to be taken into account.  Other methods that recognize this requirement are the [http://www.aia.org/liv_sdat "AIA SDAT"] (sustainable design assessment team) program and the [http://www.scenariosforsustainability.org/index.php "Scenarios for sustainability"] process design tools.

The '''Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;6''', '''''From a New Zealand Diary''''', [[Opus number|Op]].&amp;nbsp;65, is an orchestral composition by the Finnish composer [[Aulis Sallinen]], who wrote the piece from 1989–90. The [[New Zealand Symphony Orchestra]], the commissioning institution, premiered the work on 6&amp;nbsp;September 1990 in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], under the baton of Sallinen's longtime advocate, [[Okko Kamu]]. Sallinen and his wife had vacationed in New Zealand the year prior, providing the composer with inspiration for the symphony, which—though properly symphonic in scope and in structure—has been described as involving "tone painting"; indeed, each of the four movements contains a descriptive title, unusual for a Sallinen symphony. 

== Instrumentation ==
According to the publisher, [http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/7940 Novello &amp; Co], Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;6 is scored for the following:
*'''[[Woodwind section|Woodwind]]''': 3&amp;nbsp;[[flute]]s (2&amp;nbsp;doubling [[piccolo]]), 3&amp;nbsp;[[oboe]]s (1&amp;nbsp;doubling [[cor anglais]]), 3&amp;nbsp;[[clarinet]]s in B{{music|flat}} (1&amp;nbsp;doubling E{{music|flat}} clarinet, 1&amp;nbsp;doubling B{{music|flat}} [[bass clarinet]]), 3&amp;nbsp;[[bassoon]]s (1&amp;nbsp;doubling [[contrabassoon]])
*'''[[Brass section|Brass]]''': 4&amp;nbsp;[[French horn|horn]]s in F, 3&amp;nbsp;[[trumpet]]s in B{{music|flat}}, 3&amp;nbsp;[[trombone]]s, 1&amp;nbsp;[[tuba]]
*'''[[Percussion section|Percussion]]''': [[timpani]], percussionists (individual instruments?)
*'''[[String section|String]]s''': [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, [[double bass]]es, [[harp]], [[celesta]]

== Structure ==
The symphony is in four movements:
# The Islands of the Sounds. The Sounds of the Islands (''attacca'')
# Air, Rain
# Kyeburn Diggings (''attacca'')
# Finale, "Simply by sailing in a new direction / You could enlarge the world" ([[Allen Curnow]])

== Recordings ==
To date, Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;6 has received two recordings, the first of which is from 1992 with Okko Kamu conducting the Malmö Symphony Orchestra on the  [[BIS Records|BIS]] label. Finnish conductor [[:fi:Ari Rasilainen|Ari Rasilainen]] has also recorded the symphony as part of [[Classic Produktion Osnabrück|cpo's]] compendium of Sallinen's orchestral works. The Sixth Symphony joins the [[Cello Concerto (Sallinen)|Cello Concerto]] (Op.&amp;nbsp;44, 1977) on the final volume of the cpo series.

[[File:Cptvdisplay.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Flat-screen televisions for sale at a consumer electronics store in 2008.]]
'''Television''' ('''TV'''), sometimes shortened to '''tele''' or '''telly''', is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in [[monochrome]] ([[black and white]]), or in colour, and in two or [[3D television|three dimensions]] and sound. The term can refer to a [[television set]], a [[television program]] ("TV show"), or the medium of [[Transmission (telecommunications)|television transmission]]. Television is a [[mass medium]] for advertising, entertainment and news.  

Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers. After [[World War II]], an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as [[Betamax]], [[VHS]] tape, [[Hard disk drive|local disks]], DVDs, [[flash drives]], high-definition [[Blu-ray Disc]]s, and cloud [[digital video recorders]] has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies— at home on their own time schedule. For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now occurs on [[Cloud computing|the cloud]].  At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, [[digital television]] transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) ([[576i]], with 576 [[Interlacing|interlaced]] lines of resolution and [[480i]]) to [[high-definition television]] (HDTV), which provides a [[Image resolution|resolution]] that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: [[1080p]], [[1080i]] and [[720p]]. Since 2010, with the invention of [[smart television]], [[Internet television]] has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through [[streaming video]] services such as [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Video]], [[iPlayer]], [[Hulu]], [[Roku]] and [[Chromecast]].

In 2013, 79% of the world's [[households]] owned a television set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/opinions/0087/the-state-of-television-worldwide/222681|title=TVTechnology: The State of Television, Worldwide|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage [[Cathode ray tube|cathode ray tube (CRT)]] screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]]s (both [[Cold cathode#Lamps|fluorescent-backlit]] and [[LED-backlit LCD display|LED]]), [[OLED]] displays, and [[plasma display]]s was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s.&lt;ref name="cepro.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/mitsubishi_drops_dlp_displays_goodbye_rptvs_forever/|title=Mitsubishi Drops DLP Displays: Goodbye RPTVs Forever|author=Julie Jacobson|date=1 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tomsguide.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/lg-end-plasma-tvs,news-19840.html|title=LG's Exit May Herald End of Plasma TVs|author=Marshall Honorof|work=Tom's Guide|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the near future, LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs.&lt;ref name="oled-info.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oled-info.com/lg-electronics-expects-oled-tv-market-gradually-replace-led-tv-market|title=LG Electronics expects the OLED TV market to gradually replace the LED TV market|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TVs in the mid-2010s.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7497383/sony-new-smart-tv-run-android-tv-ces-2015|title=All of Sony's new Smart TVs run on Android TV|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techtimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/24117/20150103/ces-2015-new-samsung-smart-tvs-will-be-powered-by-tizen-os.htm|title=CES 2015: New Samsung Smart TVs Will Be Powered by Tizen OS|work=Tech Times|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/lg-to-show-off-webos-2-0-smart-tv-at-ces-2015/|title=LG to show off webOS 2.0 smart TV at CES 2015|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smart TV]]s with integrated Internet and [[Web 2.0]] functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.&lt;ref name="Techcrunch.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/24/internet-tv-and-the-death-of-cable-tv-really/ |title=Internet TV and The Death of Cable TV, really |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=24 October 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered [[Radio frequency|radio-frequency]] transmitters to [[broadcasting|broadcast]] the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by [[Cable television|coaxial cable or optical fiber]], [[Satellite television|satellite]] systems and, since the 2000s via the [[Internet television|Internet]]. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as [[analog television|analog]] signals, but a [[Digital television transition|transition]] to digital television is expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal [[electronic circuit]]s, including a tuner for [[Tuner (electronics)|receiving]] and decoding broadcast signals. A visual [[display device]] which lacks a [[tuner (television)|tuner]] is correctly called a [[video monitor]] rather than a television.

==Etymology==
The word ''television'' comes {{ety|grc|''τῆλε'' (tèle)|far|lat|visio|sight}}. The first documented usage of the term dates back to 1900, when the Russian scientist [[Constantin Perskyi]] used it in a paper that he presented in French at the 1st International Congress of Electricity, which ran from 18 to 25 August 1900 during the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|International World Fair]] in Paris. The Anglicised version of the term is first attested in 1907, when it was still "...a theoretical system to transmit moving images over [[telegraph]] or telephone wires".&lt;ref name="etymonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=television |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=30 December 1969 |accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "...formed in English or borrowed from French télévision."&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; In the 19th century and early 20th century, other "...proposals for the name of a then-hypothetical technology for sending pictures over distance were telephote (1880) and televista (1904)."&lt;ref name="etymonline1"/&gt; The abbreviation "TV" is from 1948.

[[Facsimile transmission]] systems for still photographs pioneered methods of mechanical scanning of images in the early 19th century. [[Alexander Bain]] introduced the facsimile machine between 1843 and 1846. [[Frederick Bakewell]] demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1851.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Willoughby Smith]] discovered the [[photoconductivity]] of the element [[selenium]] in 1873. As a 23-year-old German university student, [[Paul Nipkow|Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow]] proposed and patented the [[Nipkow disk]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Shiers, George and May (1997), ''Early Television: A Bibliographic Guide to 1940''.

Although he never built a working model of the system, variations of Nipkow's spinning-disk "[[rasterizer|image rasterizer]]" became exceedingly common.&lt;ref&gt;Shiers &amp; Shiers, p. 13, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantin Perskyi]] had coined the word  ''television'' in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|International World Fair]] in Paris on 24 August 1900.

The first demonstration of the live transmission of images was by Georges Rignoux and A. Fournier in Paris in 1909. A matrix of 64 [[selenium]] cells, individually wired to a mechanical [[commutator (electric)|commutator]], served as an electronic [[retina]]. In the receiver, a type of [[Kerr effect|Kerr cell]] modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen. A separate circuit regulated synchronization. The 8x8 [[pixel]] resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet. An updated image was transmitted "several times" each second.&lt;ref&gt;Henry de Varigny, "[http://histv2.free.fr/rignoux/rignoux1909.htm La vision à distance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231305/http://histv2.free.fr/rignoux/rignoux1909.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}", ''L'Illustration'', Paris, 11 December 1909, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 [[Edouard Belin]] sent the first image via radio waves with his [[belinograph]].

In 1911, [[Boris Rosing]] and his student [[Vladimir Zworykin]] created a system that used a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in Zworykin's words, "very crude images" over wires to the "[[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Braun]] tube" ([[cathode ray tube]] or "CRT") in the receiver. Moving images were not possible because, in the scanner: "the sensitivity was not enough and the selenium cell was very laggy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZcwhVyiMqsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Burns+%27%27Television:+An+International+History+of+the+Formative+Years%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=zworykin%20rosing%20selenium&amp;f=false R.

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:John Logie Baird, 1st Image.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The first known photograph of a moving image produced by Baird's "televisor", circa 1926 (The subject is Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson)]] --&gt;

By the 1920s, when amplification made television practical, Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] employed the [[Nipkow disk]] in his prototype video systems. On 25 March 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised [[silhouette]] images in motion, at [[Selfridges|Selfridge's]] Department Store in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v115/n2892/pdf/115504a0.pdf "Current Topics and Events"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', vol. 115, 4 April 1925, p. 505–506, {{doi|10.1038/115504a0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a ventriloquist's dummy named "Stooky Bill", whose painted face had higher contrast, talking and moving. By 26 January 1926, he demonstrated the transmission of the image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light which swept across the subject. A Selenium [[Phototube|photoelectric tube]] detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal.  This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one [[scan line]] of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face. In 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over {{convert|438|mi|km}} of telephone line between London and [[Glasgow]].

In 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and [[Bernard Natan]] of [[Pathé]] established France's first television company, Télévision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Baird, "[http://www.bairdtelevision.com/1932.html Television in 1932]", ''BBC Annual Report'', 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, he demonstrated [[ultra-short wave]] television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240-lines of resolution on [[BBC]] television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead a [[17.5mm film]] was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet.

An American inventor, [[Charles Francis Jenkins]], also pioneered the television. He published an article on "Motion Pictures by Wireless" in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses; and it was on 13 June 1925, that he publicly demonstrated synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925 Jenkins used the [[Nipkow disk]] and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of five miles, from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C., using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution.&lt;ref&gt;"Radio Shows Far Away Objects in Motion", ''The New York Times'', 14 June 1925, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glinsky"&gt;{{cite book| last = Glinsky| first = Albert| title = Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage| location = Urbana, Illinois| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2000| pages = 41–45| isbn = 0-252-02582-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent]] No. 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on 30 June 1925 (filed 13 March 1922).

[[Herbert E. Ives]] and [[Frank Gray (researcher)|Frank Gray]] of [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on 7 April 1927. Their reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. The small receiver had a 2-inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen. The large receiver had a screen 24&amp;nbsp;inches wide by 30&amp;nbsp;inches high. Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic, moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a [[copper wire]] link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from [[Whippany, New Jersey]]. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]]. A [[flying-spot scanner]] beam illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 [[millisecond]]s. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: "It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality."&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''The History of Television, 1880 to 1941'', McFarland &amp; Co., Inc., 1987, p. 101. {{ISBN|978-0-89950-284-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, [[WRGB]], then W2XB, was started as the world's first television station. It broadcast from the [[General Electric]] facility in [[Schenectady, NY]]. It was popularly known as "[[WGY (AM)|WGY]] Television". Meanwhile, in the [[Soviet Union]], [[Léon Theremin]] had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16 lines resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using [[interlacing]] in 1926. As part of his thesis, on 7 May 1926, he electrically transmitted, and then projected, near-simultaneous moving images on a five-foot square screen.&lt;ref name="glinsky"/&gt; By 1927 he achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until May 1932 by RCA, with 120 lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/rca_story_brewster.html | title=Early Electronic Television RCA TV Development: 1929 – 1949 | publisher=Early Television Museum | accessdate=20 February 2016 | author=Brewster, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 December 1926, [[Kenjiro Takayanagi]] demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This prototype is still on display at the Takayanagi Memorial Museum in [[Shizuoka University]], Hamamatsu Campus. His research in creating a production model was halted by the United States after Japan lost [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="nhk.or.jp"&gt;[http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p05/ ''Kenjiro Takayanagi: The Father of Japanese Television''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101180643/http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p05/ |date=1 January 2016 }}, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), 2002, retrieved 23 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical, image resolution on mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to 120 or so. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear.&lt;ref&gt;Donald F. McLean, ''Restoring Baird's Image'' (London: IEEE, 2000), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in Paris in 1935, and the 180-line system that [[Peck Television Corp.]] started in 1935 at station VE9AK in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/ve9ak.html |title=VE9AK entry at |publisher=Earlytelevision.org |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peck Television Corporation Console Receiver and Camera|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/peck.html|publisher=Early Television Museum|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advancement of all-electronic television (including [[Video camera tube#Image dissector|image dissectors]] and other camera tubes and [[cathode ray tube]]s for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical television, despite its inferior image quality and generally smaller picture, would remain the primary television technology until the 1930s. The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States.

In 1897, English [[physicist]] [[J. J. Thomson]] was able, in his three famous experiments, to deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT). The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist [[Ferdinand Braun]] in 1897 and is also known as the "Braun" tube.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Braun (1897) [https://archive.is/20141217172841/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89048352892;view=1up;seq=568 "Ueber ein Verfahren zur Demonstration und zum Studium des zeitlichen Verlaufs variabler Ströme"] (On a process for the display and study of the course in time of variable currents), ''Annalen der Physik und Chemie'', 3rd series, '''60''' :  552–559.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cathode Ray Tube|year=2007|work=Medical Discoveries|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|url=http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Bar-Cod/Cathode-Ray-Tube-CRT.html|accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[cold cathode|cold-cathode]] [[diode]], a modification of the [[Crookes tube]], with a [[phosphor]]-coated screen.

In 1908 [[Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton]], fellow of the [[Royal Society]] (UK), published a letter in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in which he described how "distant electric vision" could be achieved by using a cathode ray tube, or Braun tube, as both a transmitting and receiving device,&lt;ref name="Swinton_DEV1"&gt;

This is widely regarded as the first electronic television demonstration.&lt;ref name="sfmuseum"/&gt; In 1929, the system was improved further by the elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma ("Pem") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080422211543/http://db3-sql.staff.library.utah.edu/lucene/Manuscripts/null/Ms0648.xml/complete The Philo T. and Elma G.

[[File:Zworykin kinescope 1929.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Zworykin]] demonstrates electronic television (1929)]]
Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin was also experimenting with the cathode ray tube to create and show images. While working for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1923, he began to develop an electronic camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast, and poor definition, and was stationary.&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Albert, ''Zworykin, Pioneer of Television'', University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 51. {{ISBN|0-252-02104-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, on the basis of Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a [[patent interference]] suit against Farnsworth. The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application;&lt;ref name=US1691324&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=mZ9KAAAAEBAJ Zworykin, Vladimir K., Television System].

In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts, and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1&amp;nbsp;million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use his patents.&lt;ref&gt;Stashower, Daniel, ''The Boy Genius and the Mogul: The Untold Story of Television'', Broadway Books, 2002, p. 243–244. {{ISBN|978-0-7679-0759-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Everson"&gt;Everson, George (1949), ''The Story of Television, The Life of Philo T.

The basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built. Although he gave no practical details, among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc, in 1880, for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning.&lt;ref&gt;M. Le Blanc, "Etude sur la transmission électrique des impressions lumineuses", ''La Lumière Electrique'', vol. 11, 1 December 1880, p. 477–481.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish inventor [[Jan Szczepanik]] patented a color television system in 1897, using a [[selenium]] photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Burns, ''Television: An International History of the Formative Years'', IET, 1998, p. 98. {{ISBN|0-85296-914-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another inventor, [[Hovannes Adamian]], also experimented with color television as early as 1907.

Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] demonstrated the world's first color transmission on 3 July 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters of a different primary color; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] to alternate their illumination.&lt;ref&gt;John Logie Baird, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=JRVAAAAAEBAJ Television Apparatus and the Like], U.S. patent, filed in U.K. in 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on 4 February 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] studios to a projection screen at London's [[Dominion Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/crystalpalace.html Crystal Palace Television Studios]. Previous color television demonstrations in the U.K. and U.S. had been via closed circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by [[Bell Laboratories]] in June 1929 using three complete systems of [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]], amplifiers, glow-tubes, and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full color image.

The first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird. In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk. This device was very "deep", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html|title=The World's First High Definition Colour Television System|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baird was not happy with the design, and, as early as 1944, had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.

In 1939, Hungarian engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark]] introduced an electro-mechanical system while at [[CBS]], which contained an [[Iconoscope]] sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set.&lt;ref&gt;Peter C. Goldmark, assignor to Columbia Broadcasting System, "Color Television", [http://www.google.com/patents?id=7pNDAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=color+television&amp;as_drrb_ap=b&amp;as_minm_ap=1&amp;as_miny_ap=1936&amp;as_maxm_ap=12&amp;as_maxy_ap=1941&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2007&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=2007 U.S. Patent 2,480,571], filed 7 September 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was first demonstrated to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) on 29 August 1940, and shown to the press on 4 September.&lt;ref&gt;Current Broadcasting 1940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ColorTVSuccess&gt;"Color Television Success in Test", ''The New York Times'', 30 August 1940, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Color Television Achieves Realism", ''The New York Times'', 5 September 1940, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=JScDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 New Television System Transmits Images in Full Color]", ''Popular Science'', December 1940, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS began experimental color field tests using film as early as 28 August 1940, and live cameras by 12 November.&lt;ref name="ColorTVSuccess" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; "CBS Demonstrates Full Color Television," ''Wall Street Journal'', 5 September 1940, p. 1. "Television Hearing Set," ''New York Times'', 13 November 1940, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC]] (owned by RCA) made its first field test of color television on 20 February 1941. CBS began daily color field tests on 1 June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://colortelevision.info/rca-nbc_firsts.html RCA-NBC Color Firsts in Television (commented)].&lt;/ref&gt; These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and, as no color television sets were available to the public at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press. The [[War Production Board]] halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from 22 April 1942 to 20 August 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;"Making of Radios and Phonographs to End April 22," ''New York Times'', 8 March 1942, p. 1.

As early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called [[Telechrome]]. Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called "[[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]]" at the time). A demonstration on 16 August 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland &amp; Company, 2003, pp. 13–14. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html The World's First High Definition Colour Television System].&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The [[Geer tube]] was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The [[Penetron]] used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The [[Chromatron]] used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.

One of the great technical challenges of introducing color [[broadcast television]] was the desire to conserve [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], potentially three times that of the existing [[black-and-white]] standards, and not use an excessive amount of [[radio spectrum]]. In the United States, after considerable research, the [[NTSC|National Television Systems Committee]]&lt;ref name=name&gt;National Television System Committee (1951–1953), [Report and Reports of Panel No. 11, 11-A, 12–19, with Some supplementary references cited in the Reports, and the Petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the Federal Communications Commission, n.p., 1953], 17 v. illus., diagrams., tables. 28 cm. LC Control No.:54021386 [http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First Library of Congress Online Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; approved an all-electronic system developed by [[RCA]], which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. As black-and-white TVs could receive the same transmission and display it in black-and-white, the color system adopted is [backwards] "compatible". ("Compatible Color", featured in RCA advertisements of the period, is mentioned in the song "[[America (West Side Story song)|America]]", of [[West Side Story]], 1957.) The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.

Although all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G.|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7rWFRLVyvY0C&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=color+television+December+17+1953#v=onepage&amp;q=color%20television%20December%2017%201953&amp;f=false |year=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9781410614742 |page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; high prices, and the scarcity of color programming, greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]) occurred on 1 January 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.

Early color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy; so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of [[General Electric|GE]]'s relatively compact and lightweight [[Porta-Color]] set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets. Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the [[PAL]] format until the 1960s, and broadcasts did not start until 1967. By this point many of the technical problems in the early sets had been worked out, and the spread of color sets in Europe was fairly rapid. By the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color and, by the early 1980s, B&amp;W sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or for use as [[video monitor]] screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s even these areas switched to color sets.

Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signals, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by [[analog television]]. Due to [[data compression]] digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/digital-hdtv.shtml | title=HDTV Set Top Boxes and Digital TV Broadcast Information | accessdate=28 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522191336/http://www.disabled%2Dworld.com/artman/publish/digital%2Dhdtv.shtml | archivedate=22 May 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an innovative service that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, L. G. (2001). Digital Television: An Overview. Hauppauge, New York: Nova Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers. It was not until the 1990s that digital TV became feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benton.org/initiatives/obligations/charting_the_digital_broadcasting_future/sec1|title=The Origins and Future Prospects of Digital Television|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, as Japanese [[consumer electronics]] firms forged ahead with the development of [[High-definition television|HDTV]] technology, the [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]] analog format proposed by [[NHK]], a Japanese company, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies' technologies. Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard, based on an analog system, was the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.

In March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images.(7) Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being "[[simulcast]]" on different channels.(8)The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing [[NTSC]] standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.

The final standards adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, [[aspect ratios]], or lines of resolution. This compromise resulted from a dispute between the [[consumer electronics]] industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the [[computer industry]] (joined by the [[film industry]] and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes—interlaced or progressive—would be best suited for the newer digital HDTV compatible display devices.&lt;ref name="bambooav.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bambooav.com/information-about-interlaced-and-progressive-scan-signals.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816184950/http://www.bambooav.com/information-about-interlaced-and-progressive-scan-signals.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 August 2009 |title=Information about interlaced and progressive scan signals |publisher= |accessdate=22 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interlaced scanning, which had been specifically designed for older analogue CRT display technologies, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. In fact, interlaced scanning can be looked at as the first video compression model as it was partly designed in the 1940s to double the image resolution to exceed the limitations of the television broadcast bandwidth.  Another reason for its adoption was to limit the flickering on early CRT screens whose phosphor coated screens could only retain the image from the electron scanning gun for a relatively short duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfforum.com/FAQs/view/All-About-HDTV/What-s-the-Difference-between-Interlaced-and-Progressive-Video/33.html|title=What's the Difference between "Interlaced" and "Progressive" Video? – ISF Forum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However interlaced scanning does not work as efficiently on newer display devices such as [[Lcd|Liquid-crystal (LCD)]], for example, which are better suited to a more frequent progressive refresh rate.&lt;ref name="bambooav.com"/&gt;

[[Progressive scanning]], the format that the computer industry had long adopted for computer display monitors, scans every line in sequence, from top to bottom. Progressive scanning in effect doubles the amount of data generated for every full screen displayed in comparison to interlaced scanning by painting the screen in one pass in 1/60-second, instead of two passes in 1/30-second. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not "flicker" on the new standard of display devices in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offered a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then (and currently) feasible, i.e., 1,080 lines per picture and 1,920 pixels per line. Broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format. [[William F. Schreiber]], who was director of the Advanced Television Research Program at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemasource.com/articles/hist_politics_dtv.pdf|title=The history and politics of DTV|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital television transition]] started in late 2000s. All governments across the world set the deadline for analog shutdown by 2010s. Initially the adoption rate was low, as the first digital tuner-equipped TVs were costly. But soon, as the price of digital-capable TVs dropped, more and more households were converting to digital televisions. The transition is expected to be completed worldwide by mid to late 2010s.

The advent of digital television allowed innovations like smart TVs. A smart television, sometimes referred to as ''connected TV'' or ''hybrid TV'', is a television set or [[set-top box]] with integrated Internet and [[Web 2.0]] features, and is an example of [[technological convergence]] between computers, television sets and set-top boxes.  Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional [[Broadcasting|broadcasting media]], these devices can also provide Internet TV, online [[interactive media]], [[over-the-top content]], as well as [[video on demand|on-demand]] [[streaming media]], and [[home network]]ing access.

Smart TV should not to be confused with [[Internet TV]], [[Internet Protocol television]] (IPTV) or with [[Web TV]].

{{main article|3D television}}

3D television conveys [[depth perception]] to the viewer by employing techniques such as [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] display, [[free viewpoint television|multi-view]] display, [[2D-plus-depth]], or any other form of [[3D display]]. Most modern 3D [[television set]]s use an [[active shutter 3D system]] or a [[polarized 3D system]], and some are [[Autostereoscopy|autostereoscopic]] without the need of glasses. Stereoscopic 3D television was demonstrated for the first time on 10 August 1928, by [[John Logie Baird]] in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/stereo.html |title=How Stereoscopic Television is Shown |publisher=Baird Television website|accessdate=18 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101019045734/http://www.bairdtelevision.com/stereo.html| archivedate= 19 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using electromechanical and cathode-ray tube techniques. The first 3D TV was produced in 1935. The advent of digital television in the 2000s greatly improved 3D TVs. Although 3D TV sets are quite popular for watching 3D home media such as on Blu-ray discs, 3D programming has largely failed to make inroads with the public. Many 3D television channels which started in the early 2010s were shut down by the mid-2010s.According to DisplaySearch 3D televisions shipments totaled 41.45&amp;nbsp;million units in 2012, compared with 24.14 in 2011 and 2.26 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3D TV-sales growth |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/yonhap-news-agency/130318/3d-tv-sales-growth |newspaper=globalpost.com |date=18 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724082049/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/yonhap-news-agency/130318/3d-tv-sales-growth |archivedate=24 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2013, the number of 3D TV viewers started to decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Future looks flat for 3D TV|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/future-looks-flat-for-3d-tv-20130814-2rv1q.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is 3D TV dead?

[[File:UHF TV Antenna 001.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|A modern high gain UHF Yagi [[television antenna]]. It has 17 directors, and one reflector (made of 4 rods) shaped as a [[corner reflector antenna|corner reflector]].]]
Programming is [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] by television stations, sometimes called "channels", as stations are [[Frequency allocation|licensed]] by their governments to broadcast only over assigned [[Channel (broadcasting)|channels]] in the television [[band (radio)|band]]. At first, [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial broadcasting]] was the only way television could be widely distributed, and because [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was limited, i.e., there were only a small number of [[Television channel|channels]] available, government regulation was the norm. In the U.S., the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in July 1941, but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a [[television license]] fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), which had public service as part of its [[Royal Charter]].

[[WRGB]] claims to be the world's oldest television station, tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on 13 January 1928, broadcasting from the [[General Electric]] factory in [[Schenectady, NY]], under the call letters '''W2XB'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iuIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F1pgTsXYNInUgQfhoo2PAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "The First Television Show" ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1930, pp. 177–179]&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularly known as "WGY Television" after its sister radio station. Later in 1928, General Electric started a second facility, this one in New York City, which had the call letters [[W2XBS]] and which today is known as [[WNBC]]. The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. The image of a [[Felix the Cat]] doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers. On 2 November 1936, the [[BBC]] began transmitting the world's first public regular high-definition service from the Victorian [[Alexandra Palace]] in north London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/tvera.htm|title=THE HISTORY OF THE BBC: THE FIRST TV ERA|author=laurence marcus|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today.

With the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 80s, terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline; in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of US households used an antenna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/cea-study-says-seven-percent-of-tv-households-use-antennas-/220585 "CEA Study Says Seven Percent of TV Households Use Antennas"], '"TVTechnology'', 30 July 2013  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217104116/http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/cea-study-says-seven-percent-of-tv-households-use-antennas-/220585 |date=17 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/nielsen-broadcast-reliance-grew-in--/217217 "Nielsen: Broadcast Reliance Grew in 2012"], ''TVTechnology'', 14 January 2013  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218160139/http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/nielsen-broadcast-reliance-grew-in--/217217 |date=18 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to switchover to [[digital terrestrial television]] broadcasts, which offered pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an alternate to cable television (CATV) for [[cord cutters]]. All other countries around the world are also in the process of either shutting down analog terrestrial television or switching over to digital terrestrial television.

===Cable television===
{{main article|Cable television}} {{see also|Cable television by region}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2014}}

[[File:F-Stecker und Kabel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Coaxial cable]] is used to carry cable television signals into cathode ray tube and flat panel television sets.]]
Cable television is a system of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. In the 2000s, FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. The abbreviation CATV is often used for cable television. It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large "community antennas" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.calcable.org/learn/history-of-cable/ | title=History of Cable | publisher=California Cable and Telecommunications Association | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924. Earlier cable television was analog, but since the 2000s, all cable operators have switched to, or are in the process of switching to, digital cable television.

===Satellite television===
{{main article|Satellite television}}

[[File:Dishing out the truth.JPG|upright=1.15|thumb|right|DBS satellite dishes installed on an apartment complex.]]
Satellite television is a system of supplying [[television programming]] using broadcast signals relayed from [[communication satellite]]s. The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a [[satellite dish]] and a [[low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television program for viewing on a [[television set]]. Receivers can be external [[set-top box]]es, or a built-in [[tuner (television)|television tuner]]. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television.

The most common method of reception is [[direct-broadcast satellite television]] (DBSTV), also known as "direct to home" (DTH).&lt;ref name="tr101198"&gt;{{Cite report|author=Antipolis, Sophia|date=September 1997|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Implementation of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation in DVB satellite transmission systems|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101100_101199/101198/01.01.01_60/tr_101198v010101p.pdf|publisher=[[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]|pages=1–7|docket=TR 101 198|accessdate=20 July 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a [[direct broadcast satellite]] on the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;]] wavelength and are completely digital.&lt;ref name=m101&gt;{{cite journal |title=Frequency letter bands|url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/letterbands.cfm|journal=Microwaves101.com|date = 25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as [[television receive-only]]. These systems received analog signals transmitted in the [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] spectrum from [[Fixed Service Satellite|FSS]] type satellites, and required the use of large dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed "big dish" systems, and were more expensive and less popular.&lt;ref name=fcc&gt;{{cite web|title=Installing Consumer-Owned Antennas and Satellite Dishes|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/consumerdish.html|publisher=FCC|accessdate=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct-broadcast satellite television signals were earlier analog signals and later digital signals, both of which require a compatible receiver. [[Digital signal (broadcasting)|Digital signals]] may include [[high-definition television]] (HDTV). Some transmissions and channels are [[free-to-air]] or [[free-to-view]], while many other channels are [[pay television]] requiring a subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell|first=Dennis|last2=Cotter|first2=Susan|year=1998|title=Copyright Infringement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRJCwqzE3iwC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=satellite+tv+free+to+air+free+to+view+must+pay&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4lkbVObmJsvLggTq8IEY&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=satellite%20tv%20free%20to%20air%20free%20to%20view%20must%20pay&amp;f=false|location=|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=90-247-3002-3|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet television===
{{main article|Streaming television}}
{{Distinguish|Smart television|Internet Protocol television|Web television}}

Internet television (Internet TV) (or online television) is the [[digital distribution]] of television content via the Internet as opposed to traditional systems like terrestrial, cable, and satellite, although the Internet itself is received by terrestrial, cable, or satellite methods. Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows, and other video content, over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters. Internet television should not be confused with [[Smart TV]], [[IPTV]] or with [[Web TV]]. [[Smart television]] refers to the TV set which has a built-in operating system. Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. [[Web television]] is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.

{{main article|Television set}}

[[File:RCA 630-TS Television.jpg|thumb|right|RCA 630-TS, the first mass-produced television set, which sold in 1946–1947]]
A television set, also called a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or "telly", is a device that combines a tuner, display, an amplifier, and speakers for the purpose of viewing television and hearing its audio components. Introduced in late 1920's in [[Mechanical television|mechanical]] form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using [[cathode ray tube]]s. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for recorded media in the 1970s, such as [[Betamax]] and [[VHS]], which enabled viewers to record TV shows and watch prerecorded movies. In the subsequent decades, TVs were used to watch DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s of movies and other content. Major TV manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma and fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. Televisions since 2010s mostly use [[LED-backlit LCD display|LEDs]].&lt;ref name="cepro.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tomsguide.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Displaysearch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/140415_lcd_tv_growth_improving_as_plasma_and_crt_tv_disappear.asp|title=IHS Technology – The Source for Critical Information and Insight. – IHS Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/rip-rear-projection-tv/|title=RIP, rear-projection TV|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs in near future.&lt;ref name="oled-info.com"/&gt;

===Display technologies===
{{main article|Display device}}

====Disk====
{{main article|Nipkow disk}}
The earliest systems employed a spinning [[Nipkow disk|disk]] to create and reproduce images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=daKPJ7T8FhIC&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq=The+earliest+tv+systems+employed+a+spinning+disk+to+create+and+reproduce+images&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj84t-v9frUAhVE2mMKHZvhD0gQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20earliest%20tv%20systems%20employed%20a%20spinning%20disk%20to%20create%20and%20reproduce%20images&amp;f=false|title=The Kingfisher Science Encyclopedia|last=Taylor|first=Charles|date=2000|publisher=Kingfisher|isbn=9780753452691|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These usually had a low resolution and screen size and never became popular with the public.

====CRT====
{{main article|Cathode ray tube}}
[[File:Crt14.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A 14-inch cathode ray tube showing its deflection coils and electron guns]]
The cathode ray tube (CRT) is a [[vacuum tube]] containing one or more [[electron gun]]s (a source of [[electrons]] or electron emitter) and a [[fluorescent]] screen used to view images.&lt;ref name="crthistory"/&gt;
{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}It has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. The images may represent electrical [[waveform]]s ([[oscilloscope]]), pictures (television, [[computer monitor]]), [[radar]] targets or others. The CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope which is large, deep (i.e. long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile. As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick [[lead glass]] so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most [[X-ray]] emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product.

In television sets and [[computer monitor]]s, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a [[raster scan|raster]]. An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three [[electron beams]], one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a [[video signal]] as a reference.&lt;ref name='workings'&gt;{{cite web|title='How Computer Monitors Work'|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/monitor7.htm |accessdate=4 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by ''magnetic deflection'', a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although [[electrostatic deflection]] is commonly used in [[oscilloscope]]s, a type of diagnostic instrument.&lt;ref name='workings' /&gt;

====DLP====
{{main article|Digital Light Processing}}
[[File:Christie Mirage 5000.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Christie Mirage 5000, a 2001 DLP projector.]]
Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a type of [[video projector]] technology that uses a [[digital micromirror device]]. Some DLPs have a TV tuner, which makes them a type of TV display. It was originally developed in 1987 by Dr. [[Larry Hornbeck]] of [[Texas Instruments]]. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997.  Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded [[Emmy Awards]] in 1998 for invention of the DLP projector technology.  DLP is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses. DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), but also in private homes; in these cases, the image is projected onto a projection screen. DLP is also used in DLP rear projection television sets and digital signs. It is also used in about 85% of [[digital cinema]] projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Digital Light Processing Works|url=https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/light-photopolymerization/digital-light-processing-dlp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221025534/https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/light-photopolymerization/digital-light-processing-dlp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 February 2014|publisher=THRE3D.com|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plasma====
{{main article|Plasma display}}

A [[plasma TV|plasma]] display panel (PDP) is a type of [[flat panel display]] common to large TV displays {{convert|30|in|cm}} or larger. They are called "[[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]" displays because the technology utilizes small cells containing [[electrically]] [[electric charge|charged]] [[ionized]] [[gases]], or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as [[fluorescent lamp]]s.

====LCD====
{{main article|Liquid crystal display}}
[[File:LCD generic tv.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A generic LCD TV, with speakers on either side of the screen.]]
Liquid-crystal-display televisions (LCD TV) are television sets that use [[LCD]] [[display technology]] to produce images. LCD televisions are much thinner and lighter than [[cathode ray tube]] (CRTs) of similar display size, and are available in much larger sizes (e.g., 90-inch diagonal). When manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers. LCD's come in two types: those using [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]], simply called LCDs and those using [[LED]] as backlight called as [[LED-backlit LCD television|LEDs]].

In 2007, LCD televisions surpassed sales of CRT-based televisions worldwide for the first time, and their sales figures relative to other technologies accelerated. LCD TVs have quickly displaced the only major competitors in the large-screen market, the [[Plasma display|plasma display panel]] and [[rear-projection television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailytech.com/Report+Shipments+of+LCD+TVs+Surpass+CRT+TVs/article10775.htm | title=Hardware Report: Shipments of LCD TVs Surpass CRT TVs | publisher=DailyTech LLC. | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid 2010s LCDs especially LEDs became, by far, the most widely produced and sold television display type.&lt;ref name="Displaysearch.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; LCDs also have disadvantages. Other technologies address these weaknesses, including [[organic light-emitting diode|OLEDs]], [[Field emission display|FED]] and [[Surface-conduction electron-emitter display|SED]], but {{as of|2014|lc=on}} none of these have entered widespread production.

====OLED====
{{main article|Organic light-emitting diode}}
[[File:LG전자, 깜빡임 없는 55인치 3D OLED TV 공개(2).jpg|thumb|left|OLED TV]]

An OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) in which the [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emissive]] [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] layer is a film of [[organic compound]] which emits light in response to an electric current.  This layer of [[organic semiconductor]] is situated between two electrodes. Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create [[digital display]]s in devices such as [[television set|television]] screens. It is also used for computer monitors, portable systems such as [[mobile phones]], [[handheld games console]]s and [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]].

There are two main families of OLED: those based on small [[molecule]]s and those employing [[polymer]]s. Adding mobile [[ion]]s to an OLED creates a [[light-emitting electrochemical cell]] or LEC, which has a slightly different mode of operation. OLED displays can use either [[Passive matrix addressing|passive-matrix]] (PMOLED) or [[Active matrix addressing|active-matrix]] (AMOLED) addressing schemes. Active-matrix OLEDs require a [[thin-film transistor]] backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes.

An OLED display works without a [[backlight]]. Thus, it can display deep [[black level]]s and can be thinner and lighter than a [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD). In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher [[contrast ratio]] than an LCD, whether the LCD uses [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]] or [[LED-backlit LCD television|LED backlight]]. OLEDs are expected to replace other forms of display in near future.&lt;ref name="oled-info.com"/&gt;

===Display resolution===
[[File:8K UHD, 5K, 4K UHD, FHD and SD.svg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|Comparison of 8K [[Ultra-high-definition television|UHDTV]], 4K [[Ultra-high-definition television|UHDTV]], [[High-definition television|HDTV]] and [[Standard-definition television|SDTV]] resolution]]

====LD====
{{main article|Low-definition television}}

Low-definition television or LDTV refers to television systems that have a lower screen resolution than standard-definition television systems such [[240p]] (320*240). It is used in [[handheld television]]. The most common source of LDTV programming is the Internet, where mass distribution of higher-resolution [[video file]]s could overwhelm [[computer server]]s and take too long to download. Many mobile phones and portable devices such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPod Nano]], or Sony's [[PlayStation Portable]] use LDTV video, as higher-resolution files would be excessive to the needs of their small screens ([[QVGA|320×240]] and 480×272 [[pixel]]s respectively). The current generation of iPod Nanos have LDTV screens, as do the first three generations of [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPhone]] (480×320). For the first years of its existence, YouTube offered only one, low-definition resolution of 320x240p at 30fps or less. A standard, consumer grade [[VHS]] [[videotape]] can be considered SDTV due to its resolution (approximately 360 × 480i/576i).

====SD====
{{main article|Standard-definition television}}

Standard-definition television or SDTV refers to two different resolutions: [[576i]], with 576 [[Interlacing|interlaced]] lines of resolution, derived from the European-developed [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] systems; and [[480i]] based on the American National Television System Committee [[NTSC]] system. SDTV is a television system that uses a resolution that is not considered to be either [[high-definition television]] ([[720p]], [[1080i]], [[1080p]], [[1440p]], [[4K UHDTV]], and [[8K UHD]]) or [[enhanced-definition television]] (EDTV [[480p]]).  In North America, digital SDTV is broadcast in the same [[4:3]] aspect ratio as NTSC signals with widescreen content being [[center cut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/digitaltv.html|title=Digital Television|date=28 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other parts of the world that used the PAL or SECAM color systems, standard-definition television is now usually shown with a [[16:9]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], with the transition occurring between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s. Older programs with a 4:3 aspect ratio are shown in the US as 4:3 with non-ATSC countries preferring to reduce the horizontal resolution by anamorphically scaling a [[pillarbox]]ed image.

====HD====
{{main article|High-definition television}}

High-definition television (HDTV) provides a [[Image resolution|resolution]] that is substantially higher than that of [[standard-definition television]].

HDTV may be transmitted in various formats:
* [[1080p]]: 1920×1080p: 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 [[megapixel]]s) per [[frame (video)|frame]]
* [[1080i]]: 1920×1080i: 1,036,800 pixels (~1.04 MP) per [[field (video)|field]] or 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 MP) per frame
** A non-standard CEA resolution exists in some countries such as 1440×1080i: 777,600 pixels (~0.78 MP) per field or 1,555,200 pixels (~1.56 MP) per frame&lt;!-- Do not delete this, it is used for all free to air HDTV in the UK (and probably elsewhere) and is also used by various home recording equipment. See also the 1080i article. --&gt;
* [[720p]]: 1280×720p: 921,600 pixels (~0.92 MP) per frame

====UHD====
{{main article|Ultra-high-definition television}}

Ultra-high-definition television (also known as Super Hi-Vision, Ultra HD television, UltraHD, UHDTV, or [[XVGA#UHD (4K) (3840×2160)|UHD]]) includes [[4K resolution#Resolutions|4K UHD]] (2160p) and [[8K resolution#Resolutions|8K UHD]] (4320p), which are two [[digital video]] formats proposed by [[NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories]] and defined and approved by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU). The [[Consumer Electronics Association]] announced on 17 October 2012, that "Ultra High Definition", or "Ultra HD", would be used for displays that have an [[display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] of at least 16:9 and at least one digital input capable of carrying and presenting native video at a minimum resolution of 3840×2160 pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ultrahdtv.net/what-is-ultra-hdtv/ | title = What is Ultra HDTV? | newspaper = Ultra HDTV Magazine | accessdate = 27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ultrahdtv.net/the-ultimate-guide-to-4k-and-8k-ultra-hd/ | title = The Ultimate Guide to 4K Ultra HD | newspaper = Ultra HDTV Magazine | accessdate = 27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market share===
North American consumers purchase a new television set on average every seven years, and the average household owns 2.8 televisions. {{asof|2011}}, 48 million are sold each year at an average price of $460 and size of {{convert|38|in|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="martin20111227"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/27/business/tv-prices-fall-squeezing-most-makers-and-sellers.html | title=Plummeting TV Prices Squeeze Makers and Sellers | work=The New York Times | date=27 December 2011 | accessdate=27 December 2011 | author=Martin, Andrew | pages=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programming===
{{See also|Television show}}
Getting TV programming shown to the public can happen in many different ways. After production, the next step is to market and deliver the product to whichever markets are open to using it. This typically happens on two levels:

# Original run or First run: a producer creates a program of one or multiple episodes and shows it on a station or network which has either paid for the production itself or to which a license has been granted by the television producers to do the same.
# [[Broadcast syndication]]: this is the terminology rather broadly used to describe secondary programming usages (beyond original run). It includes secondary runs in the country of first issue, but also international usage which may not be managed by the originating producer. In many cases, other companies, TV stations, or individuals are engaged to do the syndication work, in other words, to sell the product into the markets they are allowed to sell into by contract from the copyright holders, in most cases the producers.

First-run programming is increasing on subscription services outside the US, but few domestically produced programs are syndicated on domestic [[free-to-air]] (FTA) elsewhere. This practice is increasing, however, generally on digital-only FTA channels or with subscriber-only, first-run material appearing on FTA. Unlike the US, repeat FTA screenings of an FTA network program usually only occur on that network. Also, [[Network affiliate|affiliates]] rarely buy or produce non-network programming that is not centered on [[local programming]].

===Genres===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
{{globalize/US|section|date=December 2014}}
[[Television genre]]s include a broad range of programming types that entertain, inform, and educate viewers. The most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually dramas and dramatic [[miniseries]]. However, other genres, such as historical Western genres, may also have high production costs.

Popular culture entertainment genres include action-oriented shows such as police, crime, detective dramas, horror, or thriller shows. As well, there are also other variants of the drama genre, such as [[medical drama]]s and daytime soap operas. Science fiction shows can fall into either the drama or action category, depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or high adventure. Comedy is a popular genre which includes situation comedy (sitcom) and animated shows for the adult demographic such as ''[[South Park]]''.

The least expensive forms of entertainment programming genres are game shows, talk shows, variety shows, and reality television. Game shows feature contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes. Talk shows contain interviews with film, television, music and sports celebrities and public figures. Variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers, such as comedians and magicians, introduced by a host or [[Master of Ceremonies]]. There is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows because leading talk shows often feature performances by bands, singers, comedians, and other performers in between the interview segments. ''Reality TV'' shows "regular" people (i.e., not actors) facing unusual challenges or experiences ranging from arrest by police officers (''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'') to significant weight loss (''[[The Biggest Loser]]''). A variant version of reality shows depicts celebrities doing mundane activities such as going about their everyday life (''[[The Osbournes]]'', ''[[Snoop Dogg's Father Hood]]'') or doing regular jobs (''[[The Simple Life]]'').

Fictional television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are  "[[quality television]]", include series such as ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]''. Kristin Thompson argues that some of these television series exhibit traits also found in [[art film]]s, such as psychological realism, narrative complexity, and ambiguous plotlines. Nonfiction television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are "quality television", include a range of serious, noncommercial, programming aimed at a niche audience, such as documentaries and public affairs shows.

]]

Around the globe, broadcast TV is financed by government, advertising, licensing (a form of tax), subscription, or any combination of these. To protect revenues, subscription TV channels are usually encrypted to ensure that only subscribers receive the decryption codes to see the signal. Unencrypted channels are known as free to air or FTA. In 2009, the global TV market represented 1,217.2&amp;nbsp;million TV households with at least one TV and total revenues of 268.9&amp;nbsp;billion EUR (declining 1.2% compared to 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/world-tv-market-2010.html Global TV 2010 – Markets, Trends Facts &amp; Figures (2008–2013)] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt; North America had the biggest TV revenue market share with 39% followed by Europe (31%), Asia-Pacific (21%), Latin America (8%), and Africa and the Middle East (2%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/global-tv-revenues-2008-2009.html Global TV Revenues (2008–09)] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, the different TV revenue sources divide into 45%–50% TV advertising revenues, 40%–45% subscription fees and 10% public funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/world-tv-market-2010.html iDate's Global TV Revenue Market Shares] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/international_television_market_report_2009.html OFCOM's Global TV Market Report 2009] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advertising====
{{main article|Television advertisement}}

TV's broad reach makes it a powerful and attractive medium for advertisers. Many TV networks and stations sell blocks of broadcast time to advertisers ("sponsors") to fund their programming.&lt;ref name="Hornick"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_50.shtml Karen Hornick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917000611/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_50.shtml |date=17 September 2010 }} "That Was the Year That Was" ''American Heritage'', Oct. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Television advertisements (variously called a television commercial, commercial or ad in [[American English]], and known in [[British English]] as an advert) is a span of television programming produced and paid for by an organization, which conveys a message, typically to market a product or service. Advertising revenue provides a significant portion of the funding for most privately owned television networks. The vast majority of television advertisements today consist of brief advertising spots, ranging in length from a few seconds to several minutes (as well as program-length [[infomercial]]s). Advertisements of this sort have been used to promote a wide variety of goods, services and ideas since the beginning of television.

[[File:Radio News Sep 1928 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Television was still in its experimental phase in 1928, but the medium's potential to sell goods was already predicted.]]

The effects of television advertising upon the viewing public (and the effects of mass media in general) have been the subject of philosophical discourse by such luminaries as [[Marshall McLuhan]]. The viewership of television programming, as measured by companies such as [[Nielsen Media Research]], is often used as a metric for television advertisement placement, and consequently, for the rates charged to advertisers to air within a given network, television program, or time of day (called a "daypart"). In many countries, including the United States, television [[Campaign advertising|campaign advertisements]] are considered indispensable for a [[political campaign]]. In other countries, such as France, political advertising on television is heavily restricted,&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Plasser, ''Global Political Campaigning'', p226&lt;/ref&gt; while some countries, such as [[Norway]], completely ban political advertisements.

The first official, paid television advertisement was broadcast in the United States on 1 July 1941 over New York station WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) before a baseball game between the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. The announcement for [[Bulova]] watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase "Bulova Watch Time", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.&lt;ref&gt;"Imagery For Profit" R.W. Stewart, New York Times, 6 July 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WNBT/Bulova test pattern|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/images/rca_bulova_ad-1.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first TV ad broadcast in the UK was on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 22 September 1955, advertising [[Gibbs SR]] toothpaste. The first TV ad broadcast in Asia was on [[Nippon Television]] in Tokyo on 28 August 1953, advertising [[Seikosha]] (now [[Seiko]]), which also displayed a clock with the current time.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:コマーシャルメッセージ|コマーシャルメッセージ (Commercial message)]], Retrieved 24 November 2013{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States=====
Since inception in the US in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediahistory.umn.edu/timeline/1940-1949.html |title=1940–1949 C.E. : Media History Project : U of M |publisher=Mediahistory.umn.edu |date=18 May 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025200852/http://www.mediahistory.umn.edu/timeline/1940-1949.html |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; television commercials have become one of the most effective, persuasive, and popular methods of selling products of many sorts, especially consumer goods. During the 1940s and into the 1950s, programs were hosted by single advertisers. This, in turn, gave great creative license to the [[advertiser]]s over the content of the show. Perhaps due to the [[quiz show scandals]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/quizshow/peopleevents/pande07.html |title=The American Experience &amp;#124; Quiz Show Scandal &amp;#124; People &amp; Events &amp;#124; The Aftermath of the Quiz Show Scandal |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; networks shifted to the magazine concept, introducing advertising breaks with multiple advertisers.

US advertising rates are determined primarily by [[Nielsen ratings]]. The time of the day and popularity of the channel determine how much a TV commercial can cost. For example, it can cost approximately $750,000 for a 30-second block of commercial time during the highly popular [[American Idol]], while the same amount of time for the [[Super Bowl]] can cost several million dollars. Conversely, lesser-viewed [[time slot]]s, such as early mornings and weekday afternoons, are often sold in bulk to producers of [[infomercials]] at far lower rates. In recent years, the paid program or [[infomercial]] has become common, usually in lengths of 30 minutes or one hour. Some [[Pharmaceutical company|drug companies]] and other businesses have even created "news" items for broadcast, known in the industry as [[video news release]]s, paying [[program director]]s to use them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Stewart]] of "[[The Daily Show]]" was mock-outraged at this, saying, "That's what we do!", and calling it a new form of television, "infoganda".&lt;/ref&gt;

Some TV programs also deliberately place products into their shows as advertisements, a practice started in feature films&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Segrave |first=Kerry |title=Product Placement in Hollywood Films |year=1994 |isbn= 0-7864-1904-0 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and known as [[product placement]]. For example, a character could be drinking a certain kind of soda, going to a particular [[Restaurant chain|chain restaurant]], or driving a certain make of car. (This is sometimes very subtle, with shows having vehicles provided by manufacturers for low cost in exchange as a [[product placement]]). Sometimes, a specific brand or [[Trademark|trade mark]], or music from a certain artist or group, is used. (This excludes guest appearances by artists who perform on the show.)

=====United Kingdom=====
The TV regulator oversees TV advertising in the United Kingdom. Its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded TV. Despite this, an early TV mogul, [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]], likened the broadcasting licence as being a "licence to print money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=34783&amp;sectioncode=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616115610/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=34783&amp;sectioncode=1 |archivedate=16 June 2011 |title=Kenneth Roy Thomson |publisher=Press Gazette |date=7 July 2006 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions mean that the big three national commercial TV channels: [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], [[Channel 4]], and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour (eight minutes in the peak period). Other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes (twelve in the peak). This means that many imported TV shows from the US have unnatural pauses where the UK company does not utilize the narrative breaks intended for more frequent US advertising. Advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs which last less than half an hour in scheduled duration; this list includes any news or current affairs programs, documentaries, and programs for children; additionally, advertisements may not be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any [[religious broadcasting]] service or other devotional program or during a formal Royal ceremony or occasion. There also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements. The [[BBC]], being strictly [[non-commercial]], is not allowed to show advertisements on television in the UK, although it has many advertising-funded channels abroad. The majority of its budget comes from [[television license]] fees (see below) and [[broadcast syndication]], the sale of content to other broadcasters.

=====Ireland=====
Broadcast advertising is regulated by the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/General-Commercial-Communications-Code.pdf General Commercial Communications Code] and [http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Childrens-Commercial-Communications-Code.pdf Children’s Commercial Communications Code], referenced in: {{cite web|url=http://www.bai.ie/index.php/2010/05/bai-launches-revised-broadcasting-codes/|title=BAI launches Revised Broadcasting Codes|date=May 2010|publisher=Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|accessdate=1 May 2016}};&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subscription====
Some TV channels are partly funded from [[subscription]]s; therefore, the signals are encrypted during broadcast to ensure that only the paying subscribers have access to the decryption codes to watch [[pay television]] or [[specialty channel]]s. Most subscription services are also funded by advertising.

====Taxation or license====
Television services in some countries may be funded by a [[television licence]] or a form of taxation, which means that advertising plays a lesser role or no role at all. For example, some channels may carry no advertising at all and some very little, including:
* Australia ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]])
* [[Belgium]] ([[RTBF]])
* [[Denmark]] ([[Danmarks Radio|DR]])
* Ireland ([[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]])
* Japan ([[NHK]])
* [[Norway]] ([[NRK]])
* [[Sweden]] ([[Sveriges Television|SVT]])
* United Kingdom ([[BBC]])
* United States ([[PBS]])

The [[BBC]] carries no [[television advertising]] on its UK channels and is funded by an annual television licence paid by premises receiving live TV broadcasts. Currently, it is estimated that approximately 26.8&amp;nbsp;million UK private domestic households own televisions, with approximately 25 million TV licences in all premises in force as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-licences-facts-and-figures-AB18/|title=TV Licensing-FOI: Licences facts and figures |publisher=tvlicensing.co.uk |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This television license fee is set by the government, but the BBC is not answerable to or controlled by the government.

The two main BBC TV channels are watched by almost 90% of the population each week and overall have 27% share of total viewing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=multichannel&amp;requesttimeout=500&amp;flag=viewingsummary |title=viewing statistics in UK |publisher=Barb.co.uk |accessdate=17 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005045049/http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=multichannel&amp;requesttimeout=500&amp;flag=viewingsummary |archivedate=5 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that 85% of homes are multichannel, with 42% of these having access to 200 free to air channels via satellite and another 43% having access to 30 or more channels via [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/tv/reports/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/dtvq307.pdf |title=The Communications Market: Digital Progress Report – Digital TV, Q3 2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=18 June 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625013029/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/tv/reports/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/dtvq307.pdf |archivedate = 25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licence that funds the seven advertising-free BBC TV channels costs £147 a year (about US$200) as of 2018 regardless of the number of TV sets owned; the price is reduced by two thirds if only black and white television is received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Licence types and costs|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/tv-licence-types-and-costs-top2|website=tvlicensing.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the same sporting event has been presented on both BBC and commercial channels, the BBC always attracts the lion's share of the [[audience]], indicating that viewers prefer to watch TV uninterrupted by advertising.

Other than internal promotional material, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) carries no advertising; it is banned under the ABC Act 1983. The ABC receives its funding from the Australian government every three years. In the 2014/15 federal budget, the ABC received A$1.11&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/03/abc-spent-nearly-50m-on-redundancy-payouts-after-coalition-budget-cuts-hit | title=ABC spent nearly $50m on redundancy payouts after Coalition budget cuts hit | publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funds provide for the ABC's television, radio, online, and international outputs. The ABC also receives funds from its many ABC shops across Australia. Although funded by the Australian government, the editorial independence of the ABC is ensured through law.

In France, government-funded channels carry advertisements, yet those who own television sets have to pay an annual tax ("la redevance audiovisuelle").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/paca/minefi_relais_sociaux/impots/fiche21.html Ministry of Finance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501212316/http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/paca/minefi_relais_sociaux/impots/fiche21.html |date=1 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, [[NHK]] is paid for by license fees (known in Japanese as {{nihongo| reception fee |受信料|Jushinryō}}). The broadcast law that governs NHK's funding stipulates that any television equipped to receive NHK is required to pay. The fee is standardized, with discounts for office workers and students who commute, as well a general discount for residents of Okinawa prefecture.

===Broadcast programming===
{{main|Broadcast programming}}
{{see also|TV listings (UK)}}
Broadcast programming, or TV listings in the United Kingdom, is the practice of organizing television programs in a schedule, with broadcast automation used to regularly change the scheduling of TV programs to build an audience for a new show, retain that audience, or compete with other broadcasters' programs.

==Social aspects==

Television has played a pivotal role in the socialization of the 20th and 21st centuries. There are many aspects of television that can be addressed, including negative issues such as [[media violence]]. Current research is discovering that individuals suffering from social isolation can employ television to create what is termed a parasocial or faux relationship with characters from their favorite television shows and movies as a way of deflecting feelings of loneliness and social deprivation.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"&gt;Butler, Fionnuala, Cynthia Pickett.  "Imaginary Friends." ''Scientific American''. 28 July 2009.  Web.  26 March 2010.  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=imaginary-friends&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have found that [[educational television]] has many advantages. The article "The Good Things about Television"&lt;ref name="good-things-about-tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/television/good_things_tv.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203124845/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/television/good_things_tv.cfm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 February 2006|title=The Good Things About Television|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely.

===Consumption===
{{main|Television consumption}}

==Negative impacts==
With high lead content in [[cathode ray tube|CRTs]] and the rapid diffusion of new flat-panel display technologies, some of which ([[LCD]]s) use lamps which contain [[mercury (element)|mercury]], there is growing concern about [[electronic waste]] from discarded televisions. Related [[occupational health]] concerns exist, as well, for disassemblers removing copper wiring and other materials from CRTs. Further environmental concerns related to television design and use relate to the devices' increasing [[electrical energy]] requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/content/download/28169/337639/version/3/file/Riseofthemachines.pdf |publisher=Energy Saving Trust |title=The Rise of the Machines: A Review of Energy Using Products in the Home from the 1970s to Today |date=3 July 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=31 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828072528/http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/content/download/28169/337639/version/3/file/Riseofthemachines.pdf |archivedate=28 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study in ''[[The Journal of Human Resources]]'' found that exposure to cable television reduced cognitive ability and high school graduation rates for boys. This effect was stronger for boys from more educated families. The article suggests a mechanism where light television entertainment crowds out more cognitively stimulating activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hernæs, Ø., Markussen, S., Røed, K. 2017.

'''''The Conservative Case for Trump''''' is a 2016 book by [[Phyllis Schlafly]], a [[movement conservative]] best known for helping to defeat the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Thorner"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Thorner | first1=Nancy | title=Thorner: 'The Conservative Case for Trump' Takes on Special Meaning with Schlafly's Death | url=http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2016/09/thorner-the-conservative-case-for-trump-takes-on-special-meaning-with-schlaflys-death.html | date=September 7, 2016 | publisher=''Illinois Review'' | accessdate=September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was her final book, being published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.regnery.com/books/the-conservative-case-for-trump/|website=Regency Publishing|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in September 2016, following the nomination of [[Donald Trump]] for [[President of the United States]], and explains in detail Schlafly's rationale for viewing Trump a serious conservative and a better candidate than [[Hillary Clinton]].

The book, co-written by [[Ed Martin (Missouri politician)|Ed Martin]] and [[Brett M. Decker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/politics/phyllis-schlafly-donald-trump-book/index.html|title=When Phyllis Schlafly made the case for Donald Trump|first=Eugene|last=Scott|work=cnn.com|date=September 7, 2016|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   describes Trump's anti-establishment stances on the following issues:

* [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic regulations]]
* [[education]]
* [[family values]]
* [[illegal immigration]]
* [[judicial activism]]
* [[political correctness]]
* [[social security]]
* the [[U.S. military]]
* [[trade]]

One argument the book makes is that Republicans who do not support Trump would wind up helping to elect Hillary Clinton instead of him.&lt;ref name="Amazon reviewers"&gt;"This book by Phyllis Schlafly, Ed Martin, and Brett Decker shows why Republicans not supporting Trump are helping elect Hillary Clinton." —[[Laura Ingraham]]&lt;/ref&gt; It also argues that Republicans and independents ought to "unify behind his candidacy".&lt;ref follow="Amazon reviewers"&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In The Conservative Case for Trump, Phyllis Schlafly, Ed Martin, and Brett M. Decker show how President Trump can get our country back on the right track, and why Republicans and independents need to unify behind his candidacy."—Newt Gingrich&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[William F. Buckley Jr.#Buckley Rule|Buckley Rule]].)

The book's publication followed Schlafly's tussle with the board of the [[Eagle Forum]] after she unilaterally endorsed Trump's presidency.&lt;ref name="Thorner" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2898">'''Theatre Tulsa, Inc.''' is a [[community theatre]] company in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], USA. 

[http://www.theatretulsa.org/ Theatre Tulsa], the longest running community theatre west of the Mississippi and seventh in the nation, has had a prosperous but sometimes difficult history. The theatre has survived multiple wars, fires, and economic depressions.  Theatre Tulsa started as a small community theatre that played shows in a tent, and grew to the largest community theatre in the nation in the 1970s, followed by years of decline and a recent re-invigoration that includes the new creation of a Broadway Series main stage season, a Next Stage series season composed of new works, and a Family Series season for children, families, and arts education programming. 

Tulsa Little Theatre was incorporated December. 10, 1922 by Mrs. Bonnie Reed and Mrs. Hope Holway. Despite the [[Great Depression]], the group managed to raise money to build a theater which was christened with a performance of ''[[The Cradle Song]]'' in February 1932. Two years later, the group incorporated as Tulsa Little Theatre. Struggling through the next few years, the theater survived a threatened bank foreclosure in 1935 after a number of donors stepped in, and in 1940 the theater paid off its mortgage. During [[World War II]], it produced shows for military camps and veterans’ hospitals. Tulsa Little Little Theatre prospered, and by 1959 was the largest non-professional theater company in the country. In 1964, its membership was 8,000 strong. By 1972 it had the largest community theater membership in the nation and had counted 1.5 million members over the past 50 years.  In 1974 Tulsa Little Theatre changed its name to Theatre Tulsa, Inc. Theatre Tulsa remains active today producing 10 productions a year that include modern and classic [[drama]]s, [[comedies]], and [[musical theatre|musicals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.theatretulsa.org/|title=Theatre Tulsa|accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theatre Tulsa has had many firsts; it was the first community theater in the country to premiere ''[[Our Town]]'' (1939) and ''[[All My Sons]]'' (1947); the musical ''[[Brownstone (musical)|Brownstone]]''(1985); “Miracle on 34th Street: A Musical Adaptation” (a 1993 original musical written for Theatre Tulsa); “''[[I Love You, You’re Perfect, Now Change]]''” (2003); and the first American production of ''[[Pitmen Painters]]'' (2011). Theatre Tulsa’s production of ''[[Forever Plaid]]'' sold out more than 400 shows in 1995 and 1996. Some noted performers, including [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]], [[Kristin Chenoweth]] and [[Sam Harris]], received their first stage experience with Theatre Tulsa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7632">'''Transmodernism''' is a philosophical and cultural movement which was founded by [[Argentina|Argentinian]]-[[Mexico|Mexican]] [[philosopher]] [[Enrique Dussel]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Cole, Mike. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PqIUx9uOMTAC&amp;dq=transmodernism&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions] Psychology Press, 2008, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; A critic of postmodernism, he instead refers to himself as a transmodernist and wrote a series of [[essay]]s criticising the postmodern theory and advocating a transmodern way of thinking. Transmodernism is a development in thought following the periodisation of [[postmodernism]]; as a movement, it also develops from [[modernism]], and, in turn, critiques modernity and postmodernity,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; viewing them as the end of modernism. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=The Symbolic Function of Transmodernity |journal=Language and Psychoanalysis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=68–87 |url=https://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008211951/http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmodernism is influenced by a great deal of philosophical movements. Its emphasis on [[spirituality]] can be said to have been influenced by the many [[esoteric]] movements during the [[Renaissance]]. Transmodernism is also highly influenced by [[transcendentalism]] and idealises different figures from mid-19th century [[United States]], most notably [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. Transmodernism also seems to be related to different aspects of [[Marxism|Marxist]] philosophy, having much common ground with dissident [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[liberation theology]].&lt;ref name="Cole, Mike 2008, p. 69"&gt;Cole, Mike. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PqIUx9uOMTAC&amp;dq=transmodernism&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions] Psychology Press, 2008, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophies==
Transmodernism's philosophical views contain elements of both modernism and postmodernism; it has been heralded as "new modernism" and admires [[avant-garde art|avant-garde styles]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Words and Music: Camus, Beckett, Cage, Gould|author=Weagel, D.F.|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433108365|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FcguzJ0VxC8C|page=9|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It bases much of its core beliefs on the [[Integral Theory]], those of creating a synthesis of "pre-modern", "modern" and "postmodern" realities.

In transmodernism, there is a place for both tradition and modernity, and it seeks as a movement to re-vitalise and modernise tradition rather than destroy or replace it. The honouring and reverence of antiquity and traditional lifestyles is very important in transmodernism, unlike modernism or postmodernism. Transmodernism criticises [[pessimism]], [[nihilism]], [[relativism]] and the [[counter-Enlightenment]], yet embracing, all to a limited extent, [[optimism]], [[Moral absolutism|absolutism]], [[foundationalism]] and [[universalism]]. It has an [[analogy|analogical]] way of thinking,&lt;ref name="Cole, Mike 2008, p. 69"/&gt; viewing things from the outside rather than the inside. 

==Movement==
As a movement, transmodernism puts a strong emphasis on [[spirituality]], alternative religions and [[transpersonal psychology]]. Unlike its postmodern counterpart, it disagrees with the secularisation of society, putting an emphasis on religion, and it criticises the rejection of worldviews as false or of no importance. Transmodernism places a strong emphasis on [[xenophily]] and [[globalism]], promoting the importance of different cultures and cultural appreciation. It seeks for a worldview on cultural affairs, and is anti-[[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] and anti-[[imperialism|imperialist]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;  

[[Environmentalism]], [[sustainability]] and ecology are important aspects of the transmodern theory; not only does transmodernism embrace environmental protection, yet it also stresses the importance of neighbourhood life, building communities as well as order and cleanliness. It accepts [[technological change]], yet only when its aim is that of improving life or human conditions.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Research in the Social Scientific Study of Religion.v.10|author1=Greer, J.M.|author2=Moberg, D.O.|date=2001|publisher=JAI Press|isbn=9780762304837|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QOa_6HNsp_EC|page=68|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent aspects of transmodernism are those of democracy and listening to the [[poverty|poor]] and [[suffering]]. 

Transmodernism in addition takes strong stances on [[feminism]], health care, family [[life]] and [[Intimate relationship|relationship]]s, promoting the emancipation of women and [[women's rights|female rights]], yet also promoting several traditional moral and ethical family values; the importance of the family is particularly stressed.

==Leading figures==
Today, whilst transmodernism still remains a minor philosophical movement in comparison to postmodernism, and is relatively new to the Northern Hemisphere, it has a large set of leading figures and philosophers. Enrique Dussel, its founder, is indeed an important philosophical figure. [[Ken Wilber]], the inventor of Integral Theory, argues from a [[transpersonal]] point of view, [[Paul Gilroy]], a cultural theorist, has also "enthusiastically endorsed" transmodern thinking,&lt;ref name="Cole, Mike 2008, p. 69"/&gt; and [[Ziauddin Sardar]], an [[Islam]]ic scholar, is a critic of postmodernism and in many cases adopts a transmodernist way of thinking. 

Several essays and works arguing from a transmodernist point of view have been published throughout the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=The Symbolic Function of Transmodernity |journal=Language and Psychoanalysis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=68–87 |url=https://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008211951/http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrea|last=Mura|title=The Symbolic Scenarios of Islamism: A Study in Islamic Political Thought|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JXu1CwAAQBAJ|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Treehouse Arts Ensemble have presented their work at Soldiers Memorial Theatre and Arts Center in Beckley, WV, at Tamarack's Hulett C. Smith Theater in Beckley, as a part of FestivAll Charleston (WV) [http://www.festivallcharleston.com FestivAll Official Site], the West Virginia Cultural Center Theatre, and at various found venues throughout Southern West Virginia.

Every summer (since 2005) the organization has operated a Youth Theater Day Camp for Tamarack: The Best of West Virginia ([http://www.tamarackwv.com Tamarack Official Site]). Emphasizing the basic elements of putting a play together, Treehouse incorporates the production of an original play with activities and lessons to not only teach children these elements, but to put them into practice as the children perform their show for an audience of friends and family. Treehouse has also participated in Tamarack's Dinner Theatre Series in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.register-herald.com/local/x519091795/Tamarack-dinner-theater-to-begin-soon | title=Tamarack dinner theater to begin soon | work=The Register-Herald | date=January 12, 2008 | accessdate=December 5, 2011 | author=Stanton, Audrey}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been slated to produce "Moon Over the Brewery" for 2008's installment of the popular series.

'''''Windows in the West''''' is a 1993 watercolour painting by the Scottish artist Avril Paton. The painting was bought by the city of Glasgow for the [[Glasgow Gallery of Modern Art]], and is currently on display at the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]].
 
==Description==
[[File:Windows in the West building, 35 Saltoun Street, Glasgow G12.jpg|thumb|right|35 Saltoun Street in September 2016.]]
The painting depicts the external profile of a 4-storey yellow [[sandstone]] [[tenement]] building during winter; the residents of the building can be seen doing various activities, with a mother and child, a man at a computer, and someone pulling aside curtains to look out at the snow outside.&lt;ref name=ETMay07&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/12783249.The_people_who_live_inside_city_apos_s_most_famous_painting/|title=The people who live inside city's most famous painting|author=Shelia Hamilton|date=9 May 2007|work=Glasgow Evening Times|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paton depicted herself standing outside the door of the building in the painting, and later found out that a cat she thought she had seen was actually made from china.&lt;ref name=ETMay07/&gt; The painting is painted in gouache, egg tempera and watercolour, measures 5 x 4ft and took six months to complete.&lt;ref name=ScotMay05&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/time-to-move-out-of-the-tenement-1-738556|title=Time to move out of the tenement|date=5 March 2005|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardJul04&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/jul/17/art|title= Snow business: Ian Jack on the enduring appeal of a painting deemed out of style|author=[[Ian Jack]]|date=17 July 2004|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper wrote of ''Windows in the West'' in 2005 that "There was something cosily familiar about the painting's cheery, glowing character, the snow-covered roof and the warm yellow stone, the embracing perspective. ...It carries a nostalgic, storybook charm; Katie Morag in Glasgow's West End".&lt;ref name=ScotMay05/&gt;

The building depicted in the painting is located at 35 Saltoun Street on the corner of Roxburgh Street in the [[Dowanhill]] district in Glasgow's [[Glasgow#West End|West End]], and is a [[Listed building#Scotland|Category B listed]] building. It was built in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB32583|title=20-26 (Even Nos) Roxburgh Street and 33-35 (Odd Nos) Saltoun Street LB32583|publisher=Historic Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Paton was living as a caretaker of a top floor flat opposite the building on Saltoun Street on 11 January 1993, when at 5.30&amp;nbsp;pm, during a heavy [[blizzard]], she saw 35 Saltoun Street "transformed" with a "lilac pink sky, lighted windows, clarity of whiteness, lots of people at home" according to Melanie Reid who interviewed Paton in 2005 for ''The Scottish Herald''.&lt;ref name=HeraldFeb05&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12398702.Window_on_another_world_Avril_Paton_is_about_to_close_the_door_on_her_life_as_The_Tenement_Painter__as_Melanie_Reid_explains/|title=Window on another world Avril Paton is about to close the door on her life as The Tenement Painter, as Melanie Reid explains|author=Melanie Reid|date=26 February 2005|work=The Scottish Herald|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preliminary drawings for the paintings were completed in February and ''Windows in the West'' was finally finished in June. Paton had not set out to create such a large work, originally intending to paint the architectural detail of the building's drum windows. Paton said in 2005 that she had "realised I had made a mistake with the size of the paper. At that time I was terribly poor...Buying art materials was difficult. I was upset that the paper was the wrong size", but was galvanised to finish the work by her son who said "Oh it would be great if you could pull it off!"&lt;ref name=HeraldFeb05/&gt;

It was originally planned to show the painting at Anne Mendelow's Gatehouse Gallery at Glasgow's Rouken Glen Park but Mendelow proposed that it was loaned to [[Glasgow Royal Concert Hall]] in the intervening period as it was taking up so much space in Paton's flat.&lt;ref name=HeraldOct94&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12666952.Window_on_life_in_the_city/|title=Window on life in the city|author=Deedee Cuddihy|date=18 October 1994|work=The Scottish Herald|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of ''Windows in the West'' at the Royal Concert Hall bought it to the attention of the director of Glasgow's museums, Julian Spalding, who purchased it for the city in 1996. Spalding subsequently said that "What it caught was that moment when it was nearly dark, but people haven't drawn the curtains yet, and you can walk along the street and look into windows, and there's the light inside, and the light outside. People are going about their business in a private way; at the same time they have not yet hidden their private world. There is the balance between the inner life and the outer life that is just beautifully caught".&lt;ref name=ScotMay05/&gt; Paton's 1988 painting ''The Barras'' had previously been bought by Glasgow Art Galleries and Museums and as her major sale it had established her as an artist.

Paton subsequently described the residents as having been "thrilled to be in the painting...That building was a community in itself. They were colourful characters, who were always having parties".&lt;ref name=ETMay07/&gt; Paton has described her surprise at the popularity of the work, saying in a 2005 interview that "I find that quite amazing, because I don't understand it at all. I wasn't aware that it was going to be anything other than just another painting for an exhibition. I lived there for four to six years before I started the painting. I used to look at that building continually and enjoy it. I enjoyed seeing what people were doing. I would stand in the window, drink a cup of tea. Once it was painted, I never looked at it again".&lt;ref name=ScotMay05/&gt;

In a May 2007 article for the ''[[Glasgow Evening Times]]'', Shelia Hamilton interviewed residents of the building depicted in ''Windows in the West'' who recalled their memories of Paton and the effect of the painting on their lives. Hamilton wrote that "Maybe the day will come when there's a plaque on the wall...and we get guided tours. But for now, all most of us can do is wander along the street just round the corner from the Byres Road and have a quick peek as we pass by and wonder what it's like to live inside a painting" and described the building as "probably the most famous tenement in the world". Hamilton attributed the paintings appeal to the fact that "...they are real people living real lives and the reason why this picture has such a hold on the public's imagination. Outside, it may be icy in the painting but inside the rooms they are cocooned forever in safety and warmth".&lt;ref name=ETMay07/&gt; Paton said in a 2005 interview that "I haven't distanced myself from it; the picture has distanced itself from me. It's like a child. It goes off and leads its own life".&lt;ref name=HeraldFeb05/&gt;

Paton has sold almost 30,000 prints and 100,000 cards of reproductions of the painting; in 2005 it was the top selling print in Glasgow's Gallery of Modern Art shop.&lt;ref name=ScotMay05/&gt;

''Windows in the West'' featured in a 2005 poll by the ''[[Glasgow Herald]]'' newspaper to find Scotland's favourite painting, and as a result of which subsequently inspired a poem by the [[Poet Laureate of Scotland]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]].&lt;ref name="Morgan2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edwin Morgan|title=Beyond the Sun: Scotland's Favourite Paintings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBItAgAACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Luath Press|isbn=978-1-905222-72-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in architecture''' have been documented for many centuries, as professional (or amateur) practitioners, educators and clients. Since architecture became organized as a  profession in 1857, the number of women in architecture has been low.  At the end of the 19th century, starting in Finland, certain [[List of international architecture schools|schools of architecture]] in Europe began to admit women to their programmes of study. In 1980  
[[M. Rosaria Piomelli]], born in Italy, became the first woman to hold a deanship of any school of architecture in the United States, as Dean of the [[City College of New York]] School of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu/exhibits/fiftyexhibit/rosaria_piomelli.html |title=rosaria_piomelli |publisher=Digital-archives.ccny.cuny.edu |date=1937-10-24 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only in recent years have women begun to achieve wider recognition with several outstanding participants including two [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker prizewinners]] since the turn of the millennium.

==Early examples==
Two European women stand out as early examples of women playing an important part in architecture, designing or defining the development of buildings under construction. In France, [[Katherine Briçonnet]] (ca. 1494–1526) was influential in designing the [[Château de Chenonceau]] in the [[Loire Valley]], supervising the construction work between 1513 and 1521 and taking important architectural decisions while her husband was away fighting in the Italian wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k870051/f856 M. E. Aubry-Vitet, "Chenonceau"], in ''Revue des deux mondes'', no 69 (1867), p.855. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain|Britain]], there is evidence that [[Elizabeth Wilbraham|Lady Elizabeth Wilbraham]] (1632–1705) studied the work of the Dutch architect [[Pieter Post]] as well as that of [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]] in [[Veneto]], Italy, and the [[Landshut Residence|Stadtresidenz]] at Landshut, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;John Millar [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/critics/the-first-woman-architect/8608009.article ''The first woman architect''], The Architects' Journal, 11 November 2010. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She has been put forward as the architect of [[Wotton House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] and of many other buildings. It has also been suggested that she tutored [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]].  Wilbraham had to use male architects to supervise the construction work.&lt;ref name="Indy first lady"&gt;Jay Merrick [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/elizabeth-wilbraham-the-first-lady-of-architecture-2215936.html ''Elizabeth Wilbraham, the first lady of architecture''], The Independent, 16 February 2011. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now much research including that by [[John Millar (historian)|John Millar]]&lt;ref name="Indy first lady" /&gt; to show she may have designed up to 400 buildings including 18 London churches previously attributed to her pupil  Sir Christopher Wren.

Towards the end of the 18th century, another Englishwoman, [[Mary Townley (architect)|Mary Townley]] (1753–1839), tutored by the artist [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], designed several buildings in [[Ramsgate]] in south-eastern England including [[Townley House]] which is considered to be an architectural gem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelsbookshop.com/blogpicts2/townley.htm Paul Nettleingham, "Townley House in Ramsgate"], ''Michaels Bookshop Ramsgate''. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sarah Losh]] (1785-1853) was an English woman and landowner of [[Wreay]].  She has been described as a lost [[Romanticism|Romantic]] genius, antiquarian, architect and visionary.  Her main work is [[St Mary's Church (Wreay)]], Cumbria, but she also constructed various associated buildings and monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmaryswreay.org/ St Mary's Church Wreay] (Accessed Sept 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny Uglow|Uglow, Jenny]] (2012) ''The Pinecone'', Faber and Faber&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J.B.

==Modern pioneers==
Yet another Englishwoman, [[Sophy Gray (architect)|Sophy Gray]] (1814–1871), wife of [[Robert Gray (bishop of Cape Town)|Robert Gray]] who became bishop of [[Cape Town]] in 1847, proved to be a competent assistant, not only helping her husband with his administrative and social obligations but above all by designing at least 35 of the [[South Africa]]n Anglican churches completed between 1848 and 1880, all in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style in which she showed strong interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/archframes.php?archid=643 "Gray, Sophia (Sophie) Wharton Myddleton"], ''ArteFacts''. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The daughter of a French-Canadian carriage maker, [[Mother Joseph Pariseau]] (1823–1902) was not just one of the very earliest female architects in North America but a pioneer in the architecture of the north-western United States. In 1856, together with four sisters from [[Montreal]], she moved to [[Vancouver, Washington]] where she designed eleven hospitals, seven academies, five schools for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] children, and two orphanages in an area encompassing today's [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]], northern [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/joseph_m.cfm "Mother Joseph", ''Architect of the Capitol'']. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louise Blanchard Bethune]] (1856–1913) from [[Waterloo (town), New York|Waterloo, New York]], was the first American woman known to have worked as a professional architect. In 1876, she took a job working as a draftsman in the office of [[Richard A. Waite]] and F.W. Caulkings in [[Buffalo, New York]] where she worked for five years, demonstrating she could hold her own in what was a masculine profession. In 1881, she opened an independent office partnered with her husband Robert Bethune in Buffalo, earning herself the title as the nation's first professional woman architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.arch.uiuc.edu/organizations/wia/timeline/bethunelouise.html "Louise Blanchard Bethune (1856-1913)"], ''Women in Architecture (University of Illinois)''.

Another early practicing architect in the United States was [[Emily Williams (architect)|Emily Williams]] (1869–1942) from northern California. In 1901, together with her friend Lillian Palmer, she moved to [[San Francisco]] where she studied drafting at the [[Lick-Wilmerding High School|California High School of Mechanical Arts]]. Encouraged by Palmer, she went on to build a number of cottages and houses in the area, including a family home on 1037 Broadway in San Francisco, now a listed building.&lt;ref name=Horton&gt;[http://www.womenarchitectsca.com/sample-biographies/emily-williams/ Inge S.

[[Theodate Pope Riddle]] (1868–1946) grew up in a well-to-do background in Farmington, Connecticut, where she hired faculty members to tutor her in architecture. Her early designs, such as that for [[Hill-Stead Museum|Hill-Stead]] (1901), were translated into working drawings by the firm of [[McKim, Mead and White]], providing her with an apprenticeship in architecture. She was the first woman to become a licensed architect in both New York and Connecticut and in 1926 was appointed to the AIA College of Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arvha.asso.fr/archi_fem/arvha_french/info_arvha/document_info/us-archi.html "Women in Architecture"], ''ARVHA''. Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable pioneer of the early days was [[Josephine Wright Chapman]] (1867–1943). Chapman received no formal education in architecture but went on design a number of buildings before setting up her own firm. The architect of [[Tuckerman Hall]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], she is considered to be one of America's earliest and most successful female architects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuckermanhall.org/chapmanfull.pdf "Josephine Wright Chapman and Tuckerman Hall"], ''Tuckermanhall.org''. Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanian architect [[Virginia Andreescu Haret]] (1894–1962), first woman to graduate with a degree in architecture in 1919 and first woman as Romanian Architectural Inspector General. She continued her studies in [[Italy]]. 
She worked at the Technical Service of the Ministry of Education, for which reason she did numerous and important projects for schools, in [[Bucharest]] (Şincai and Cantemir Lyceum) as well as in the country (Bârlad, Focşani). Side by side with buildings of large dimensions, she also designed houses for one or two persons. The mobility did not stop at the studies in Italy, she was present also at numerous congresses of architecture in Rome, Paris, Moscow, Bruxelles ...

A highly influential player was [[Mary Colter]] (1869–1958). After studying at the [[California School of Design]] in [[San Francisco]], she was employed by the [[Fred Harvey Company]], first for interior design but soon to take on ambitious architectural projects, including landmark hotels and [[wikt:Special:Search/rustic|Rustic]] lodges in the Southwest, several in Grand Canyon National Park.

==First academic qualifications==

===Finland===

Finland is the country in which women were first permitted to undertake architectural studies and receive academic qualifications&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arvha.asso.fr/archi_fem/arvha_french/info_arvha/document_info/paivi_nikkanen_uk.htm Päivi Nikkanen-Kalt, "Female architects in Finland"], ''ARVHA''. Retrieved 23 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; even if they were initially given the status of special students. The earliest record belongs to [[Signe Hornborg]] (1862–1916) who attended the [[Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture|Helsinki Polytechnic Institute]] from the spring of 1888, graduating as an architect in 1890 "by special permission".  She does not, however, appear to have acted as an independent architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architekturarchiv-web.de/frauen.htm Karl Heinz Hoffmann and Anika Hakl, "Frauen und Häuser"], ''Hamburgisches Architekturarchiv der Hamburgischen Architektenkammer''. {{de icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other graduates in architecture at the Polytechnic Institute in the 1880s include Inez Holming, Signe Lagerborg, Bertha Enwald, Stina Östman and [[Wivi Lönn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecta.fi/sivu.php?sivu=historia "Perustaminen: Nainen arkkitehtina"], ''Architecta''. {{fi icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lönn (1872–1966), who attended the institute from 1893 to 1896, has the honour of being the first woman to work independently as an architect in Finland. On graduating, she immediately established her own architectural firm by receiving a commission to design the building of a Finnish-language girls' school in Tampere. She designed several significant public buildings, including more than thirty school buildings. Lönn won five architectural competitions alone, including the municipal fire-station in Tampere in 1906, an unusual design for a woman at that time. Lönn won two competitions with [[Armas Lindgren]] with him she designed the [[New Student House, Helsinki|New Student House]] in [[Helsinki]] (1910) and the [[Estonia Theatre]] in [[Tallinn]] (1913). One of her last was the Sodankylä Geophysical Observatory, completed in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=3438 "Lönn, Wivi (1872 - 1966)"], ''Biografiakeskus''.

Following excellent results, she was accepted as a regular student the following year and graduated as a "master builder" in 1894. She went on to design 98 buildings in the [[Mariehamn]] district of the Åland Islands, mostly town houses and farm houses in the ornamental Swiss style. However, she did not qualify as an architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mariehamn.ax/Kulturforvaltningen/Stadens_historia/Hilda_Hongell_ "Hilda Hongell"], ''Mariehamns stad''. {{sv icon}} Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other early graduates===

[[Fay Kellogg]] (1871–1918) learnt her architectural skills with a German tutor who taught her drafting, at the [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn, and by working with Marcel de Monclos in his Paris atelier. She had hoped to study at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] but as a woman was refused admission. As a result of her efforts, however, the institution later opened its doors to women wishing to study architecture. On her return to the United States, Kellogg helped design the [[Surrogate's Courthouse|Hall of Records]] in Lower Manhattan before opening a studio of her own. She went on to design hundreds of buildings in the New York area, encouraging the [[New York Times]] to describe her as "one of the most successful woman architects in America".&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/11/17/106768465.pdf "Woman Invades Field of Modern Architecture"], ''The New York Times'', November 17, 1907.

She was initially refused admission as a woman in 1896 but reapplied and was successfully admitted in 1898. After graduating in 1901, she returned to California where she had a prolific and innovative career, blazing new paths professionally, stylistically, structurally, and aeshetically, setting high standards of excellence in the profession.  Completing over 700 projects, she is especially known for her work for women's organizations and key clients, including [[Hearst Castle]] in [[San Simeon, California|San Simeon]], considered to be one of her masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070623083708/http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/english/remarkable/panel4.html "Julia Morgan, Early Architect, 1872-1957"], ''California State Capitol Museum''.

She was not successful in gaining admittance, and returned to America in 1906, where she did practice architecture. She designed the [[Pine Mountain Settlement School]] in [[Kentucky]] as well as a number of buildings in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] where she was the first architect to incorporate the natural terrain into her designs and the first to use cast-in-place concrete walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/news/news3.html "Mary Rockwell Hook"], ''International Archive of Women in Architecture''.

[[Isabel Roberts]] (1871–1955), born in [[Missouri]], studied architecture in New York City at the Masqueray-Chambers Atelier, established by [[Emmanuel Louis Masqueray]] along the lines of the French École des Beaux-Arts.

[[Esther Hill|Esther Marjorie Hill]] was the first woman to graduate from a Canadian architecture school, in 1920.

==European developments==
After Finland, several other European countries allowed women to study architecture. In [[Norway]], the first female architect was [[Lilla Hansen]] (1872–1962) who studied at the Royal Drafting School (''Den Kongelige Tegneskole'') in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (1894) and served architectural apprenticeships in Brussels, Kristiania and Copenhagen. She established her own practice in 1912 and gained immediate success with Heftyeterrassen, a [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-baroque]] residential complex in Oslo. She went on to design a number of large villas as well as student accommodation for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Lilla_Hansen/utdypning "Lilla Hansen"], ''Store Norske Leksikon''. {{no icon}} Retrieved 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first woman to run an architecture practice in [[Germany]] was [[Emilie Winkelmann]] (1875−1951). She studied architecture as a guest student registered as Student Emil at the [[University of Hanover|College of Technology]] in [[Hanover]] (1902–1908) but was refused a diploma as women were not entitled to the qualification until 1909. Working from her practice in Berlin where she employed a staff of 15, she completed some 30 villas before the outbreak of war. One of her most notable buildings is the Tribüne theatre in [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], originally a girls school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlin.de/ba-charlottenburg-wilmersdorf/bezirk/winkelmann.html "Emilie Winkelmann, Architektin"], Lexikon: Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf von A bis Z, ''Berlin.de''. {{de icon}} Retrieved 17 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male and female professional partnerships==
[[File:Alvar and Elissa Aalto.jpg|thumb|Alvar and Elissa Aalto (1950s)]]
A number of the more important women architects in the first half of the 20th century partnered with men, often forming husband-and-wife practices.&lt;ref name="Anthony"&gt;Kathryn H. Anthony, "Designing for Diversity: Gender, Race, and Ethnicity in the Architectural Profession", University of Illinois Press (2001), p. 56 et seq., {{ISBN|0-252-02641-1}} (online here [https://books.google.com/books?id=qqo2LXIaW7YC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=architecture+husband+wife+partners&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WjXomoDx7f&amp;sig=aY4NpsdR3jJwZoBdMpkR9RbRJ4w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y72ST7jNEcnN0QX7gaH9AQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=architecture%20husband%20wife%20partners&amp;f=false]).&lt;/ref&gt; Such partnerships began in the early years of women's involvement when some of the most successful male architects worked with women. Since the 1960s, which saw increased enrollment by women into schools of Architecture, male and female students have often met and later married; long hours working together and a shared passion have been described as "the perfect prescription for romance".&lt;ref name="Anthony 56"&gt;Anthony, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; A good overview of this topic is also discussed in Ann Forsyth's "In Praise of Zaha" &lt;ref name=Forsyth&gt;{{cite journal|title=In Praise of Zaha |date=2006-09-27 |doi=10.1111/j.1531-314X.2006.00082.x |volume=60 |issue=2 |journal=Journal of Architectural Education |pages=63–65|last1 = Forsyth|first1 = Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male-female partnerships in architecture sometimes lead to misattribution of the work to the male partner, often because the male is better known. This can be seen as the result of an underlying discrimination or biased attitude. What has been described as the "tradition of misattribution" has remained a "secret" until recent years.&lt;ref name="Anthony 56-57"&gt;Anthony, p. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some particularly notable male-female partnerships in architecture include:

* [[Aino Aalto]] (1894-1949) and [[Alvar Aalto]] - after qualifying as an architect in Finland in 1920, she married Alvar Aalto in 1923 and participated in the design of his earlier buildings, often contributing to the interiors as in the [[Villa Mairea]] (1937) in [[Noormarkku]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alvaraalto.fi/info/press/09eng_villa-mairea.htm "Internet exhibition on Alvar Aaltos Villa Mairea"], ''Alvar Aalto''.

* [[Reima and Raili Pietilä]], another Finnish couple, worked closely together developing their early Modernistic style. Raili Pietilä (born 1926) found two the perfect number for a design team, explaining: "We often took our work with us: for a walk, in the kitchen, and in the evenings. And when doing competitions we used to take trips, like long train journeys, because we found that changing your environment affects your thinking."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20080424/breaking-the-modernist-mold David Sokol, "Breaking the Modernist Mold: Raili Pietilä reflects on a life of design with her husband, Reima, and the new exhibition that examines the Pietilä legacy"], ''Metropolismag.com'', 24 April 2008.

She later recalled how Le Corbusier insisted on strict adherence to his demanding principles: "The smallest pencil stroke had to have a point, to fulfil a need, or respond to a gesture or posture, and to be achieved at mass-production prices." After collaborating with Le Corbusier for about ten years, Perriand left his studio in 1937 to concentrate on furniture design, often working with [[Jean Prouvé]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://designmuseum.org/design/charlotte-perriand "Charlotte Perriand, Architect + Furniture Designer (1903-1999)"], ''Design Museum''.

The architectural historian Jane King Hession remarked: "By her example she inspired many women in architecture, myself included, but she didn't want to be known as a woman architect — just as an architect who happened to be a woman."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uminnpressblog.com/2010/08/then-and-now-old-gray-heads-part-two.html "Then and Now: 'Old Gray Heads,' part two -- Elizabeth Close"], ''University of Minnesota Press''.

*Also in Australia, [[Mary Turner Shaw]] (1906-1990) had found it difficult to complete her architecture studies at the University of Melbourne, and instead became an architect via articled studentship. She worked for various architectural firms in [[Australia]] (1931-1936) and the UK (1937), and traveled Europe meeting many key Modernist architects. After working for others again in Australia (1938), she formed an architectural firm, Romberg &amp; Shaw, with the Modernist architect [[Frederick Romberg]]. The firm operated from 1939 to 1942. During that period they produced "some of the most celebrated blocks of [[Apartment|flat]]s in [[Australia]]",&lt;ref name="Willis (2012)"&gt;Willis, J. 2012 "Shaw, Mary Turner" in P.Goad and J.Willis "The Encyclopedia of Australian Architecture, Cambridge University Press, New York, p.624&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Yarrabee Flats]], [[South Yarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]](1940) and the [[Newburn Flats]], [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]in 1939. Shaw continued to practice architecture until her retirement in 1969.
*[[Denise Scott Brown]] (born 1931) and [[Robert Venturi]] met at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1960. Shortly after their marriage in 1967, Scott Brown joined his [[Philadelphia]] firm Venturi and Rauch, where she became principal in charge of planning in 1969. She has since played a major role at the firm (renamed Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in 1989) leading civic planning projects and studies, and collaborating with Venturi on the firm's larger projects. She is however resentful of the fact that she is seldom credited for her work. For example, it was her husband who was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 1991 although she explains: "We both design every inch of a building together." In 1997 she speculated: "The question of being a woman will be in the air for ever in my case. If I had not married Bob, would I have gone further or not? Who can tell? But the same question holds for him. If he had not married me, would he have gone further?"&lt;ref name=Anthony/&gt; Denise Scott Brown also disclosed her feelings about this situation in a chapter of "Gender Space Architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender space architecture an interdisciplinary introduction|url = http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=169967|publisher = Routledge|date = 2000-01-01|location = London; New York|isbn = 9780203449127 |first = Jane|last = Rendell|first2 = Barbara|last2 = Penner|first3 = Iain|last3 = Borden|pages = 229, 263|chapter = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[Serbia]], [[Ljiljana Bakić]] often worked with her husband Dragoljub Bakić. Their most important work was the design of the [[Aleksandar Nikolić Hall|Pionir Sports Hall]], for which they won the "Grand Prix of the Belgrade Architecture Salon" in 1974. Another [[Serbia]]n architect, [[Ivanka Raspopović]], partnered with fellow architect [[Ivan Antić]] to design  [[Belgrade]]'s "[[Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade|Museum of Contemporary Art]]" and [[Kragujevac]]'s "[[Šumarice Memorial Park|21 October Museum]]" in the 1960's. Both buildings have since become national monuments.

==Progress since 2000==
Several women architects have had considerable success in recent years, gaining wide recognition for their achievements:

In 2004, the Iraqi-British architect [[Zaha Hadid]] became the first woman to be awarded the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="award"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34337929 |title=Dame Zaha Hadid awarded the Riba Gold Medal for architecture - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date= 2015-09-24|accessdate=2015-09-24|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among her many projects, special mention was made of the [[Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art]] in [[Cincinnati]] and the [[BMW Central Building]] in Leipzig. When awarding the prize, the chairman of the jury, spoke of her "unswerving commitment to modernism" explaining how she had moved away from existing typology, from [[High-tech architecture|high-tech]], shifting the geometry of buildings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2004/announcement "Announcement: Zaha Hadid Becomes the First Woman to Receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize"], ''The Pritzker Architecture Prize''.

In 2010, another woman became a Pritzker Prize winner, [[Kazuyo Sejima]] from Japan, in partnership with [[Ryue Nishizawa]]. [[Peter Palumbo, Baron Palumbo|Lord Palumbo]], the jury chairman, spoke of their architecture "that is simultaneously delicate and powerful, precise and fluid, ingenious but not overly or overtly clever; for the creation of buildings that successfully interact with their contexts and the activities they contain, creating a sense of fullness and experiential richness." Special consideration had been given to the Glass Center at the [[Toledo Museum of Art]] in Ohio, and the [[21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa]] in [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2010/announcement "Announcement: Architectural Partners in Japan Become the 2010 Pritzker Architecture Prize Laureates"], ''The Pritzker Architecture Prize''.

In 2007 [[Anna Heringer]] (born 1977, Germany) won the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] for her [[METI Handmade School]] built with bamboo and other local materials in [[Rudrapur, Bangladesh|Rudrapur]], [[Bangladesh]]. An example of [[sustainable architecture]], the project was praised not only for its simple, humane approach and beauty but also for the level of cooperation achieved between architects, craftsmen, clients and users.&lt;ref name=akdn2007&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/Content/240Nine-projects-receive-2007-Aga-Khan-Award-for-Architecture "Nine projects receive 2007 Aga Khan Award for Architecture"], ''Aga Khan Development Network''.

==Women's influence==

Although until recently their contributions have been largely unnoticed, women have in fact exerted a fair amount of influence on architecture over the past century. It was [[Susan Lawrence Dana House|Susan Lawrence Dana]], heiress to a mining fortune, who in 1902 chose to have her house in [[Springfield, Illinois]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], so ensuring his breakthrough. Women have also played a key role in historic preservation through organizations such as the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (1890).&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn H. Anthony in Helen Tierney (ed.), ''Women's Studies Encyclopedia, Vol. 1'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, pp. 104–108.

Routledge, 2003. pp. xiv–xv. {{ISBN|9780415284493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on experience in Canada highlights the widespread contributions women have made in recent years, developing innovative approaches to practice and design. Women's significant and growing presence in the profession has attracted more attention than issues of marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annmarie Adams]], Peta Tancred.

Exhibitions presenting women's achievements in various fields provided early opportunities for women demonstrate their competence in designing pavilions. They included the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 exhibition in Chicago]], where the women's pavilion was designed by [[Sophia Hayden Bennett|Sophia Hayden]], and two in 1914 in Germany: the [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)|Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne]], whose ''Haus der Frau'' was designed by [[Lilly Reich]], and the Burga Expo in Leipzig devoted to books and graphic art. Inspired by these successes, in 1928 [[Lux Guyer]] from Switzerland designed pavilions for [[SAFFA]] (''Schweizerische Ausstellung für Frauenarbeit'') a fair exhibiting the accomplishments of women first held in [[Bern]]. The second SAFFA, held in [[Zurich]] in 1958, was put together by a team of 28 female architects, establishing architecture as a profession open to women in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblion.epfl.ch/EPFL/theses/1992/1079/1079_abs.pdf Évelyne Lang, "Les Premières Femmes Architectes de Suisse"], ''École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne''. {{fr icon}} Retrieved 24 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent statistics==

It is not easy to find reliable statistics on women's place in architecture across the world. Much of the information is dated and some is based on surveys inviting responses but with no guarantee of comprehensive coverage.

;Europe:
In 2010, a survey conducted by the [[Architects' Council of Europe]] in 33 countries, found that there were 524,000 architects, of whom 31% were women. However the proportions differed widely from country to country. The countries with the highest proportion of female architects were Greece (57%), Croatia (56%), Bulgaria (50%), Slovenia (50%) and Sweden (49%) while those with the lowest were Slovakia (15%), Austria (16%), the Netherlands (19%), Germany (21%) and Belgium (24%). Over 200,000 of Europe's architects are in Italy or Germany where the proportions of women are 30% and 21% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ace-cae.eu/public/contents/getdocument/content_id/1079 "The Architectural Profession in Europe 2010"], ''Architects' Council of Europe''.

;Australia 
A study conducted in Australia in 2002 indicated that women comprise 43% of architecture students while their representation in the profession varied from 11.6% in [[Queensland]] to 18.2% in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].
More recent Australian data, collected and analyzed as part of the Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession research project, shows that whatever measure used women continue to disappear from the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/about/research/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have comprised over 40% of Australian architecture graduates for over two decades, but are only 20% of registered architects in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 'half-life' of women architects - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/the-half-life-of-women-architects/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|publisher = |last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|last2 = Clark|first2 = Justine|authorlink2 = Justine_Clark|date = 2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 1: at school - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-at-school/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 2: at work - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-part-2-at-work/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updating the numbers, part 3: Institute membership - Parlour|url = http://archiparlour.org/updating-the-numbers-part-3-institute-membership/|website = archiparlour.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|last = Matthewson|first = Gill|authorlink = Gill_Matthewson|date = 2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26448">&lt;nowiki/&gt;{{Women in society sidebar|Comedy=}}'''Women in comedy''' refers to females who participate in comedic works as well as their experience within the social environment. While primarily dominated by men throughout history, women have been represented in the field of comedy since the mid 1700s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wsupress.wayne.edu/books/detail/laughing-feminism|title=Laughing Feminism Subversive Comedy in Frances Burney and Maria Edgeworth|date=2002|publisher=Wayne State University Press|last1=Bilger|first1=Audrey|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=We Killed: The Rise of Women in American Comedy|date=2002|publisher=Sarah Crichton Books|last1=Kohen|first1=Yael}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comedy]], or creative works with the intention of humor, is thought to have originated in ancient Greek theatre in 425 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhaawA_m9SEC&amp;pg=PR9|title=Lysistrata|last=Aristophanes|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Nick Hern Books|isbn=978-1-85459-325-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the first figures to enter the field, however, were faced with resistance and discrimination.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/documentary/womenincomedy|title=Women in Comedy|work=MAKERS|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2007/01/hitchens200701|title=Why Women Aren't Funny|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en|newspaper=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of humor in women was previously thought to have meant the ability to laugh at a man's joke, rather than tell the joke herself.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When women did finally enter comedy (in its various forms), it was seen as niche, thus making bookings hard to come by.

Early acts were often based in the standard roles of women as a housewife and mother.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Comedy was tailored to what men would find to be both funny and non-threatening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As women gained slow acceptance to their presence in comedy, they were able to expand the topics that they covered.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since then, women have made significant gains in the field, having found fame through stand-up, television, movies, and writing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Women such as [[Amy Schumer]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Wanda Sykes]], [[Gina Barreca]] and many others have contributed to the world of comedy, spanning both time and medium.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As comedic license has grown, comedy has become a tool within the scope of [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; By reclaiming a previously male-exclusive art form, female comedians are able to use patriarchal structure against itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Today, feminist comedy draws attention to female issues such as [[menstruation]], [[rape]], [[gender inequality]], beauty norms, and [[machismo]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As a readily acceptable and understandable medium of communication, comedy lends itself to the feminist movement, allowing women's issues to be more wide-spread in general society.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Comedic forms==

===Stand-up===
Stand-up comedy is a form of comedy in which performers act in front of a live audience, creating an interactive dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dz-hsuL3r_QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=stand%20up&amp;f=false|title=Look Who's Laughing: Gender and Comedy|last=Finney|first=Gail|date=1994-01-01|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9782881246449|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes range from short one-liners to longer monologues. The comedic form requires a takeover the stage, in order for the comedian's material to "kill."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For women, the direct contact with the audience puts their womanhood on display. Many female comedians choose to wear loose-fitting clothing to take their femininity out of the spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bitchmedia.org/post/here-is-whats-scary-about-being-a-female-stand-up-comic|title=Here is What's Scary About Being a Female Stand-Up Comic. {{!}} Bitch Media|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late night television===
[[File:SamanthaBeeFeb2011.jpg|thumb|[[Samantha Bee]] at a [[Hudson Union Society]] event in February 2011]]
American late night television (''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'' etc...) has been dominated by white men for almost its entire existence. With the exception of ''[[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee|Full Frontal]]'' with [[Samantha Bee]], no woman has had a late night show on a major network of her own. The platform allows a variety of comedic  (monologues and shorts) and political (interviews and exposés) opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexandra-popken/why-its-time-for-a-woman-_b_6813704.html|title=Why It's Time for a Woman to Host a Late Night Talk Show|last=Popken|first=Alexandra|date=2015-03-06|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/137160/why-are-there-so-few-female-late-night-hosts#.migMKG8nY|title=Why Are There So Few Female Late-Night Hosts?|last=Mic|work=Mic|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Film in general, as well as comedic film, continues to show the gender imbalance of other forms of comedy. In 2014, a study found that there were 2.24 male characters for every one female character. Of the movies surveyed, only 30.9% of the speaking characters were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/20-mustknow-facts-about-g_b_5869564.html|title=20 Facts Everyone Should Know About Gender Bias in Movies|last=Chemaly|first=Soraya|date=2014-09-24|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, one of the major storylines in the film industry (the romantic comedy), consistently follows traditional female roles, relegating women to simply searching for a male partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/14/romantic-comedies-failing-women_n_7026302.html|title=How Romantic Comedies Are Failing Women (And How To Fix It)|last=Karlin|first=Lily|date=2015-04-14|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender imbalance==
The gender imbalance between men and women can be found all over, even on Wikipedia. The page: [[list of comedians]] show a much higher number of males than females.

===In pay===
In the [[United States]], there is a large gender gap between men and women in comedy with regards to both pay and number.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ozy.com/acumen/stand-ups-gender-gap/4661|title=It's Really No Joke|last=Humphries|first=Will|work=OZY|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, all ten of the top ten paid comedians were male, bringing in a total of $173 million.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 2016, one female entered the list: [[Amy Schumer]], at number two.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etcanada.com/photos/170240/forbes-list-of-highest-paid-comedians-for-2016/#image-170249|title=Forbes’ List Of Highest-Paid Comedians For 2016|last=Crisp|first=Gavin|website=etcanada.com|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In appearances===
A study in 2017 found a large gender imbalance in UK comedic panel shows, with only 31% of the appearances. However, the same study also found marked improvement since 1989, when the statistic was 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://strudel.org.uk/panelshows/index.html|title=UK Panel Show Gender Breakdown|website=strudel.org.uk|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the UK industry website Chortle lists 269 female comedian as compared to 1,279 male comedians.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Imbalance can also be seen at the level of the comedy club. For example, the prestigious New York comedy club [[Carolines on Broadway|Carolines]] featured 20% female performers to 80% male in 2014.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Within the writers room, gender imbalance persists. Women made up only 10 percent of writers working on the top 250 domestic grossing films of 2010 and 15 percent of writers and 18 percent of creators in prime-time television during the 2010–2011 season.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In South Korea, of 70 comedic variety shows, 13 had all male hosts and guests, and 23 with all male hosts, meaning that more than half of these shows lack female hosts.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Only two shows had all females hosts and guests.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Shows without hosts often try to model marriages by pairing up male and female celebrities.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; While this does achieve some sense of gender balance, it uses very traditional roles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==Gendering of humor==
The early female figures in stand up, such as [[Phyllis Diller]], were able to enter the mainstream through their willingness to self-deprecate and declare themselves ugly. Other early female comediennes, such as [[Mae West]] and [[Helen Kane]], used [[sex appeal]] to attract male audiences. In other words, they were able to enter, but on the terms of male comedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Queens of comedy: Lucille Ball, Phyllis Diller, Carol Burnett, Joan Rivers, and the new generation of funny women|last=Horowitz|first=Susan|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More modern female comedians cite a need to tailor their comedy to what men would find to be funny, with change in this mentality only coming very recently.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===In stand-up===
[[Stand-up comedy|Stand up comedy]], in particular, is described as a masculine art form.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/documentary/womenincomedy|title=Women in Comedy|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en|newspaper=MAKERS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words that are used to describe success are often violent, such as ''killed'' or ''annihilated.''&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The performer must take charge of the stage, claiming it as their own via the phallic symbol of the microphone.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The structure of joke is often centered on an attack on another party. The aggression that such an art form necessitates is encouraged in males but discouraged in females.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karen|first=Stoddard|year=1977|title="WOMEN HAVE NO SENSE OF HUMOR" AND OTHER MYTHS: A CONSIDERATION OF FEMALE STAND-UP COMICS, 1960–1976|journal=American Humor|volume=4|pages=|jstor=42594582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination against women==
In many societies around the world, a woman's role has affected her flexibility in comedy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caliskan|first=Sevda|date=1995-01-01|title=Is There Such a Thing as Women's Humor?|journal=American Studies International|volume=33|issue=2|pages=49–59|jstor=41279344}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries that historically view women as inferior to men, comedy is seen as a masculine discipline.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The common perception that women aren't funny pervades all aspects of comedy, including stand-up, television, and movies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The comedy establishment, influenced by patriarchal society, has relegated women to the "side of tears and loss." Systematic sexism can be found at the level of audience members, bookers, agents, and male comics.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2015/10/discrimination-female-comedians/|title=The unfunny things that happen to funny women|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a powerful social tool, comedy brings women outside of the traditional role that has been defined as theirs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Women have experience everything from [[Heckler|heckling]] audience members calling them gendered terms like bitches or sluts, to being invited to fake comedic festivals (so the organizer could have sex with the female comedian), to being introduced in roasts as the girl that "slept with one of the judges."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Feminist tool==
Humor has been used a tool of feminism both for its ability to point out patriarchy and the structures it creates as well as identify the common female experience.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bing|first=Janet|year=2004|title=Is Feminist Humor an Oxymoron?|url=http://digitalcommons.odu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=english_fac_pubs|journal=Women and Language|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction must be made between female humor and feminist humor. Female humor is self-deprecatory, turning inwards to the performer herself.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Feminist humor, by contrast, looks outwards at the societal structures that demean women. It is aggressive and pointed, using comedic language formerly reserved for men only as a tool of liberation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Feminist humor is to be an agent of change for women by drawing attention to their lowered position in society.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knobloch|first=Susan|date=1996-01-01|title=Review of The Unruly Woman: Gender and the Genres of Laughter|journal=Film Quarterly|volume=50|issue=2|pages=58–60|doi=10.2307/1213431|jstor=1213431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Bing argues that for feminist humor to be most effective at its goal of change, it should be inclusive, rather than divisive.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Divisive humor, or jokes that focus on male structures or male-bashing, do not advance feminism, but rather continue to marginalize females.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Inclusive humor that riffs off of the shared experience of women, can be subversive without the negative effects of divisive humor.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Bing continues to say that when humor falls into this inclusive comedy it contributes to feminism by first, contradicting the age old stereotype that women cannot be funny, and second, by undermining the status quo.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Humor itself can be used to make strong structural changes in a society. Many times humor has been used to subvert hierarchical structures. For example, the [[Guerrilla Girls]] used humor to point out the patriarchal, unchanging nature of the Tony awards, which give the majority of their prizes to men.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It also functions to establish an in-group (those making and understanding the joke) and an out-group (those on the receiving end).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Through this process, humor can create solidarity within a group, but can also make another feel excluded.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For women, this can serve to strengthen them as a community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Representation worldwide==

===Bangladesh===
Outside of the United States, women have been having similar experiences in their attempts to enter field of comedy, colored by their own cultural influences. One such women is [[Farhana Muna]], a Bangladeshi Muslim comic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Her material is focused on Bangladeshi life and culture, from parties to relatives commenting on weight loss. According to Muna, she often feels constrained by what is deemed appropriate or not for a Bangladeshi Muslim women. She must watch what she says and wears. Muna reemphasized the sentiment that there is a wider range of comedy acceptable for men. She has also faced criticism for her actions, including her choice to not wear the [[hijab]], with people calling her a bad Muslim. However, she continues her comedic work due to the community of women that she has met through it. Muna sees comedy as a collective platform of expression, a way to share her experiences in a relatable way.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anushay-hossain/becoming-munatic-how-a-ba_b_9283354.html|title=Becoming Munatic: How a Bangladeshi Woman is Changing the Rules of Comedy Online|last=Hossain|first=Anushay|date=2016-02-22|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Women have been on the rise in India's comedy as recently as 2016. In a country that has deeply entrenched patriarchal values, these female comedians face great amounts of cultural animosity.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Female-Stand-Up-Comedians-India/#.n0ztf1urd|title=These Female Comedians Are Taking The Stand-Up Industry By Storm, One Joke At A Time|last=ScoopWhoop|date=2016-04-22|work=ScoopWhoop|access-date=2017-04-07|language=En}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this discrimination women such as [[Aditi Mittal]] and [[Neeti Palta]] have found success in an industry that did not readily accept them.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

===South Korea===
In [[South Korea]], female comedians do not encounter many comedic opportunities.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/asia/korean-tv-gender-imbalance-1202019919/|title=Korean TV’s Gender Imbalance No Laughing Matter|last=Kil|first=Sonia|date=2017-04-03|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two television programs are completely hosted by females, with the other major television opportunity being couples shows. South Korean TV shows only offer gender balance when women are in gendered roles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Producers see men as more advantageous hires as the shows' audiences are majority women. Additionally, there was a worry that audiences would react badly to strong women in television.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; As the woman's movement grows in South Korea, so too do the opportunities for women. Rather than featuring beautiful women as prizes to be won by males contestants, new shows such as ''[[Sister's Slam Dunk|Sisters' Slam Dunk]]'' (which premiered in 2016) feature women working together to solve problems.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==Figures==
=== Phyllis Diller ===
One of the most prominent early figures in American female comedy, [[Phyllis Diller]] made her comedic debut at the Purple Onion Comedy Club in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/phyllis-diller-9542308#breakthrough-role|title=Phyllis Diller|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her stand-up routines focused on the problems of the suburban [[housewife]], a previous unaddressed area by male comics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By opening acknowledging her lack of physical attractiveness and by incorporating self-deprecation into her routines, Diller was able to enter comedy in a time when funny and attractive women were seen as threatening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, by confining her comedy to her inability to fulfill her traditional role, she reinforced female stereotypes rather than dismissing them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Joan Rivers===
[[Joan Rivers]] (active from 1959–2014) was one of the first female comedians to utilize the "talk/conversational" method, one that was suited to television talk shows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike [[Phyllis Diller]], who was quite unlike her comedic personality, the comedy of Joan Rivers more closely reflected her personality. She often drew on her own personal experiences as a self-proclaimed Jewish princess.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike her predecessors, Rivers did not downplay her attractiveness, but rather incorporated it into her riffs on life as a single woman.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Still, her comedy was focused on the traditional problems of a women (trying to find a boyfriend and husband, being a good wife etc).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Jane Curtin===
[[Jane Curtin]] was a part of the inaugural class of [[Not Ready For Prime Time Players|Not Ready for Prime Time Players]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1975. On SNL, she was the anchor for Weekend Update and started in many well known skits including ''Coneheads''.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jane-curtin-222399|title=Jane Curtin|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Weekend Update, she served as the liberal counterpart to Dan Aykroyd’s conservative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/womens-blog/2015/feb/16/saturday-night-live-40-eight-feminist-milestones|title=Saturday Night Live at 40: Eight feminist milestones|last=Henderson|first=Danielle|date=2015-02-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, when asked about the environment at [[Saturday Night Live]], Curtin said that female writers faced an extremely difficult battle, especially when cast member like [[John Belushi]] were actively working against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/womens-blog/2015/feb/16/saturday-night-live-40-eight-feminist-milestones|title=Saturday Night Live at 40: Eight feminist milestones|last=Henderson|first=Danielle|date=2015-02-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; While fundamentally believing that women are not capable of humor, he also would sabotage pieces written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2011/04/jane_curtain_reveals_john_belu.html|title=Jane Curtin Says John Belushi Was a Total Sexist|date=2011-04-12|work=Vulture|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this atmosphere, Jane Curtin had a very successful career at SNL and went on to work on sitcoms, Broadway, and various movies.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

===Tina Fey===
[[File:Amy Poehler and Tina Fey by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Female comedians [[Tina Fey]] (left) and [[Amy Poehler]] (right) at an event from the movie ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]'']]
Figures such as [[Tina Fey]] have paved the way in the modern era for large-scale growth in female comedy.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauzen|first=Martha|date=2014-01-02|title=The Funny Business of Being Tina Fey: Constructing a (feminist) comedy |journal=Feminist Media Studies| volume=14|issue=1|pages=106–117|doi=10.1080/14680777.2012.740060|issn=1468-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her public appointment as the first female head writer of [[Saturday Night Live]] placed her in a position to serve as a feminist comedy icon.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Many of her sketches became iconic, particularly her satirical portrayal of Vice Presidential Candidate [[Sarah Palin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flowers|first=Arhlene A.|last2=Young|first2=Cory L.|date=2010-01-01|title=Parodying Palin: How Tina Fey’s Visual and Verbal Impersonations Revived a Comedy Show and Impacted the 2008 Election|journal=Journal of Visual Literacy|volume=29|issue=1|pages=47–67|doi=10.1080/23796529.2010.11674673|issn=1051-144X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her comedic writing ([[Mean Girls]], [[30 Rock]], [[Bossypants]], [[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]], Date Night etc...), in addition to achieving great public notice, was well received by critics.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Miranda Hart===
[[Miranda Hart]] is a female comedian from the UK. She is most well-known for her television series ''[[Miranda (TV series)|Miranda]].'' Her awkward and clumsy character in the show is a embodiment of all the society neuroses that women face in daily life.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/dec/01/miranda-hart-tv-queen-uncool|title=Miranda Hart – TV's queen of uncool|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|date=2010-12-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a style of comedy makes her into an everywoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Gd6_BwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=miranda+hart+comedy&amp;ots=V1My1fB1Yb&amp;sig=Fsgbg21vUl-k_8m6zx_oWUIfwr4#v=onepage&amp;q=miranda%20hart%20comedy&amp;f=false|title=Twenty-first Century Feminism: Forming and Performing Femininity|last=Nally|first=C.|last2=Smith|first2=A.|date=2015-02-27|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137492852|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart herself sees a divide in comedy, with some using comedy as a tool to increase their coolness (others) and some using comedy as a tool for clowning around (her).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; By staying within the clowning realm of comedy, she achieved a cult following.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
