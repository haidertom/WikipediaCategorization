[[File:Cuirassiers_1805_Meissonier_Chantilly.jpg|thumb]]
'''''1805, Cuirassiers Before the Charge''''' (French - ''1805, Les Cuirassiers avant la charge'', ''Cuirassiers of 1805, before battle'' or ''1805'') is an 1878 painting by [[Ernest Meissonier]], showing a column of [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] [[cuirassier]]s in the uniform of the [[12th Cuirassier Regiment (France)|12th Cuirassier Regiment]] before making a cavalry charge. Artillery are shown taking up position in the right background, whilst on a hill in the far distance (between the second and third NCO from the right) can be seen [[Napoleon]] and his chief of staff.

First exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]] of 1878 in Paris, it was bought for 275000 francs by the Belgian collector [[Prosper Crabbe]]. It then passed into the collection of [[Ernest Secrétan]] and was lot 39 in the sale of that collection in 1889, from which it was bought for 199652 francs by [[Henri d'Orleans, duke of Aumale]]. The duke kept it in his [[château de Chantilly]] and gave it to the [[Institut de France]] with the rest of his collection - it now forms part of the [[musée Condé]].

'''''Ask the Dust''''' is a 2006 American-German film based on the book ''[[Ask the Dust]]'' by [[John Fante]].  The film was written and directed by [[Robert Towne]] and remains, {{asof|2015|lc=y}}, his last feature film. [[Tom Cruise]] (with [[Paula Wagner]] and [[Cruise/Wagner Productions]]) served as one of the film's producers.  The film was released on a limited basis on March 17, 2006 and was entered into the [[28th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2006 |title=28th Moscow International Film Festival (2006) |accessdate=2013-04-21 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421051006/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2006 |archivedate=2013-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed almost entirely in [[South Africa]] with the use of stages to portray [[Los Angeles]].

==Plot==
The story is set during the [[The Great Depression|Great Depression]], specifically around the time of the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]]. Camilla ([[Salma Hayek]]) is a fiery, beautiful [[Mexico|Mexican]] café waitress who aspires one day to be above her current standing in society, to make something of herself, to give her and her future children a place and chance in the world. Farrell's character is portrayed as a struggling writer who comes to Los Angeles's [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, California|Bunker Hill]] area to start his writing career. Though he falls in love with Camilla, he does not marry her. Later, Camilla is infected by [[tuberculosis]] and leaves Arturo without informing him. When Arturo finds her, she is about to die and he promises to marry her, but Camilla dies and Arturo writes a novel dedicated to Camilla. Arturo writes a dedication in one of his books to her and throws it into the sand.

==Cast==
* [[Colin Farrell]] as Arturo Bandini
* [[Salma Hayek]] as Camilla Lopez
* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Hellfrick
* [[Eileen Atkins]] as Mrs. Hargraves
* [[Idina Menzel]] as Vera Rivkin
* [[Justin Kirk]] as Sammy
* [[Dion Basco]] as Patricio/houseboy
* [[Jeremy Crutchley]] as Solomon, the bartender
* [[William Mapother]] as Bill
* [[Tamara Craig Thomas]] as Sally

==Production==
Part of the film was shot at [[Pinelands High School]], on fields modified to simulate a Los Angeles scenery.

==Film delays==
The rights to the novel once belonged to [[Mel Brooks]], though he let them lapse.  Towne met Fante in the 1970s.  This meeting led to his interest in the project. Despite finishing the script in the early 1990s, he couldn't find financial backing from a studio.  During this time, Farrell's role was originally set to be played by [[Johnny Depp]] but he dropped out.  Later [[Val Kilmer]] accepted the role and also dropped out.  Another delay was Hayek initially rejecting the role to avoid being typecast as a Mexican immigrant.  She accepted the role eight years later.

==Critical reception==
The film received negative to mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 35% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 104 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ask_the_dust/ |title=Ask the Dust Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2008-03-29 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080329155859/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ask_the_dust/| archivedate= 29 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] reported the film had an average score of 58 out of 100, based on 33 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/askthedust |title=Ask the Dust (2006): Reviews |accessdate=2008-03-29 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420075426/http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/askthedust| archivedate= 20 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Books of Blood''''' are a series of [[horror fiction]] collections written by the British author [[Clive Barker]].

There are six books in total, each simply subtitled ''Volume 1'' through to ''Volume 6'', and were subsequently re-published in two omnibus editions containing three volumes each. Each volume contains four or five stories. The volume 1–3 omnibus was published with a foreword by Barker's fellow Liverpudlian horror writer [[Ramsey Campbell]].

They were published between 1984 and 1985. With the publication of the first volume, Barker became an overnight sensation and was hailed by [[Stephen King]] as "the future of horror". The book won both the [[British Fantasy Award|British]] and [[World Fantasy Award]]s.

Although undoubtedly horror stories, like most of Barker's work they mix fantasy themes in as well. The unrelentingly bleak tales invariably take place in a contemporary setting, usually featuring [[Everyman|everyday people]] who become embroiled in terrifying or mysterious events. Barker has stated in ''[[Faces of Fear (interview book)|Faces of Fear]]'' that an inspiration for the ''Books of Blood'' was when he read ''[[Dark Forces (book)|Dark Forces]]'' in the early 1980s and realised that a horror story collection need not have any narrow themes, consistent tone or restrictions. The stories could range from the humorous to the truly horrific.

For some editions, each book's cover was illustrated by Clive Barker himself.

Eighteen of the stories in the ''Books of Blood'' were adapted by Eclipse Books in the comic series ''[[Tapping the Vein (comic)|Tapping the Vein]]'' as well as other titled adaptations.

Several of the stories have been adapted into films, "[[Rawhead Rex (film)|Rawhead Rex]]" (1986); "[[Books of Blood#The Forbidden|The Forbidden]]" (filmed in 1992 as ''[[Candyman (film)|Candyman]]'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rose|first=Bernard|title=INTERVIEW / The sweet smell of excess: Bernard Rose has an oral fixation: Kevin Jackson talked to him about the appetites behind his new horror film, Candyman|date=13 March 1993|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/interview--the-sweet-smell-of-excess-bernard-rose-has-an-oral-fixation-kevin-jackson-talked-to-him-about-the-appetites-behind-his-new-horror-film-candyman-1497390.html|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lovell|first=Glenn|title=Black Slasher `Candyman` Draws Fire Over `racist` Depictions|date=29 October 1992|publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]''|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-10-29/features/9204080203_1_candyman-white-women-tony-todd|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Books of Blood#The Last Illusion|The Last Illusion]]" (filmed in 1995 as ''[[Lord of Illusions]]''); "[[Books of Blood#The Body Politic|The Body Politic]]" (filmed in 1997 as ''[[Quicksilver Highway]]''); "[[The Midnight Meat Train]]" (2008); "[[Books of Blood#The Book of Blood|The Book of Blood]]" and "[[Books of Blood#On Jerusalem Street (a postscript)|On Jerusalem Street (a postscript)]]" (combined and filmed in 2008 as ''[[Book of Blood (2008 film)|Book of Blood]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clivebarker.info/newfilmse.html#bob |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203105858/http://www.clivebarker.info/newfilmse.html#bob |archivedate=3 February 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Dread (film)|Dread]]" (2009). "[[The Yattering and Jack]]" was adapted by Barker himself in 1986 for the US series ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]''.

==Story list and synopses==

===Volume One===

====The Book of Blood====

This is the [[frame story]] for the entire ''Books of Blood'' series. A [[psychic]] researcher, Mary Florescu, has employed a [[Quackery|quack]] [[Medium (spirituality)|medium]] named Simon McNeal to investigate a [[haunted house]]. Alone in an upstairs room, McNeal at first fakes visions, but then the ghosts attack him for real and carve words in his flesh {{ndash}} comprising the rest of the stories as a literal, living "Book of Blood." 

This prologue, along with closing story "On Jerusalem Street" from Volume Six, was adapted into the film ''[[Book of Blood]]'', written and directed by [[John Harrison (filmmaker)|John Harrison]].

====The Midnight Meat Train====

After [[New York City|New York]] office worker Leon Kaufman falls asleep on a late-night [[Rapid transit|subway]] train, he awakens to discover that the next car over has been turned into an [[abbatoir]] where other passengers have been butchered. Kaufman encounters the killer, a man named Mahogany, and kills him in [[self-defense]]. The motorman, nonplussed at Mahogany's death, brings the train into a secret station where strange, malformed humanoid creatures board and eat the bodies. It is revealed that the creatures, the "City Fathers", have been the secret rulers of New York for centuries, and show Kaufman an immense being further inside the [[catacombs]]. They then pull out Kaufman's tongue to ensure his silence, recruiting him as the new "butcher" devoted to bringing fresh meat to the City Fathers.

A [[The Midnight Meat Train|film of the same name]] was released on 1 August 2008. The film differs from the book in a number of ways, most notably with the introduction of additional characters such as Maya, Leon's girlfriend.   [[Bradley Cooper]] and [[Vinnie Jones]] star in the film.

====The Yattering and Jack====

Jack Polo is a [[gherkin]] importer who is haunted by a minor [[demon]] called the Yattering. The demon is commanded to haunt Jack by [[Beelzebub]], because one of Jack's ancestors reneged on a pact made with the demon lord. The Yattering is frustrated when its determined efforts to drive Jack insane are answered with good cheer and apparent obliviousness. Unknown to the Yattering, Jack is purposely ignoring the demon in order to simultaneously frustrate it and maintain his own sanity. The Yattering subjects him to increasingly severe torments, including killing his cats and terrorising his family, but these efforts all fail. Eventually Jack tricks the Yattering into violating its orders, allowing Jack to take advantage of a [[loophole]] and make the Yattering his slave.

Unusual for Barker's early work, this story is unabashedly comic. It was made into an episode of the horror anthology TV series ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'' (Season 4 - 1987/88, episode 76; broadcast Nov 8, 1987) with Barker writing the screenplay from his own story.

====Pig Blood Blues====

Former policeman Redman starts working in a [[borstal]], where he uncovers a deadly secret involving a boy named Lacey. Lacey claims that a missing boy named Henessey is not missing, but rather is present in the form of a ghost. As Redman investigates, he finds that things are not what they seem, and that a giant pig in a sty on the grounds is possessed by Henessey's soul.

====Sex, Death and Starshine====
Leroy Townsonio is directing ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' in a run-down theatre. Leroy relies on the [[soap opera]] fame of his leading lady, Diane Duvall, to bring in a big audience; however, this is compromised by his affair with Diane and her poor acting skills. A mysterious man with an obscured face, Mr. Lichfield, introduces himself and expresses dissatisfaction with Diane's casting as [[Viola (Twelfth Night)|Viola]]. On the day of the final rehearsal, Lichfield confronts Diane and states that his wife, Constantia, will play the role on opening night. Diane removes Lichfield's mask to reveal him as an animated corpse. Lichfield kisses Diane, and she slips into a [[coma]]. Constantia takes over the role of Viola while Diane is put in intensive care. Following her "recovery", Leroy realises during sex that Diane is [[undead]], just before she kills him.

The play opens to a packed house. When the house lights are extinguished after the performance, the actors realise that the audience consists entirely of ghosts and decaying corpses. The theatre trustee, newly-dead Tallulah, burns down the theatre. Every living player in the production is killed. Several of the actors and Leroy join Mr. Lichfield and Constantia on the road as a repertory company of the undead.

====In the Hills, the Cities====
In an isolated rural area of [[Yugoslavia]], two entire cities, Popolac and Podujevo, create massive communal creatures by binding together the bodies of their citizens. Almost forty thousand people walk as the body of a single giant as tall as a skyscraper. This ritual occurs every ten years, but this time things go wrong and the Podujevo giant collapses, killing tens of thousands of citizens horribly. In shock, the entire population of Popolac goes mad and becomes the giant they are strapped into. Popolac wanders the hills aimlessly. By nightfall many of the people who make up the giant die from exhaustion, but the giant continues walking.

Mick and Judd, two gay men vacationing in the area, come upon the smashed bodies of the Podujevans in a ravine awash with blood. A local man tries to steal their car to catch up with Popolac and reason with it before it collapses and destroys the people who compose it. The man explains the truth of the situation to Mick and Judd, but they do not believe his story. They seek shelter at a remote farm, where Popolac blunders into the farmhouse, killing Judd accidentally. Mick and the elderly couple who own the farmhouse are driven mad with fear. Mick wants to join Popolac. He climbs up the tower of ropes and bodies, and is carried away as it walks into the hills.

A line from this story, "stale incense, old sweat, and lies," appears in the song ''Sin'' on the album ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' by the American industrial band [[Nine Inch Nails]].

===Volume Two===

====Dread====
Steve, a young student, becomes acquainted with an older classmate named Quaid, an intellectual who has a morbid fascination with [[fear]]. Quaid reveals to Steve that he kidnapped a [[vegetarian]] girl and imprisoned her in a room with merely a [[steak]] for sustenance, only releasing her when she finally overcame her dread of eating meat to prevent [[starvation]]; she eats the meat even though it has spoiled. Steve becomes Quaid's next candidate for his experiments, held captive in a dark, silent room, forcing him to relive a childhood period of deafness that terrified him. Steve is driven [[insane]] by this forced [[sensory deprivation]] and eventually butchers Quaid with an axe. Quaid's experiments, all along, were to try to help him understand the nature of fear, but ironically his experiments in [[phobias]] made his own worst fears come to life.

This story has been made into a [[Dread (film)|film]], with [[Jackson Rathbone]] playing Steve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=''Dread'' Poster Creeps Online |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33665/dread-poster-creeps-online |publisher=DreadCentral.com |date=22 September 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hell's Event====
Every one-hundred years, during an annual [[London]] marathon, [[Satan]] sends one of his representatives to compete against the (unsuspecting) human runners. If Satan's minion wins, he gets to rule the Earth. An athlete taking part in the event, Joel, begins to realise the actual stakes of the race when the other runners begin to fall, savaged by some unseen beast. A [[satanist]] politician, Gregory, has made a bargain with Hell on the outcome of the race. Joel does not win due to a struggle with Hell's shape-shifting runner, a demonic [[Familiar spirit|familiar]] who bites off his face. However, during this struggle, the last surviving runner jogs past them to the finishing line. Hell loses out once again. Gregory is punished for his overconfidence by being gruesomely slain.

====Jacqueline Ess: Her Will And Testament====
Jacqueline Ess is a housewife who attempts [[suicide]] after becoming bored with her life. She recovers only to find that she has an ability to change people's body shapes with her mind. She accidentally kills her therapist and then – somewhat less accidentally – her husband, simply by willing their bodies into tearing apart or folding in on themselves. One man becomes obsessed with her and tracks her down. Jacqueline eventually becomes a [[prostitute]], her abilities giving her the power to give men the ultimate sexual experience, albeit one that always proves fatal. She has by now lost control of herself and has to be watched while sleeping in case she unconsciously mutilates her own body. The man eventually makes love to Jacqueline and they willingly die together by her powers.

This story is also published in the book ''I Shudder at Your Touch''.

====The Skins of the Fathers====
After his car breaks down in [[Arizona]], a man named Davidson witnesses a bizarre parade of freakish monsters. It turns out that these creatures mated with a woman in a nearby town six years previously, and are intending on reclaiming the child, which they promptly achieve. Davidson reaches the town, where a [[Posse comitatus|posse]] of gun-toting locals are eager to set out to slay the monsters. Everything goes wrong, however, and Davidson and just a few other survivors end up with a horrific fate; they sink in [[quicksand]] which then hardens when they are half-buried, and are left for dead in the burning desert heat.

This was used as a scene in the film ''[[Lord of Illusions]]'', which was in turn based on "The Last Illusion", a story in volume six.

====New Murders in the Rue Morgue====
Lewis is a 73-year-old man who goes to [[Paris]] after his friend, Phillipe, is arrested for butchering a young woman. Phillipe eventually commits suicide in his cell after babbling about an [[orangutan]] who committed the murder he had been arrested for. Lewis does not believe it until he sees the primate – dressed like a human, completely shaved, and wielding a razor – for himself. The beast had been raised by Philippe, a notorious eccentric, as a strange experiment based on [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[The Murders in the Rue Morgue|classic story]].

===Volume Three===

====Son of Celluloid====
An escaped convict dies behind a film screen. Over the years following his death, a cancerous [[tumor]] gains sentience from the strong emotions of the cinema's audiences and torments the few people that remain after a show. The sole survivor of the massacre is seen some time later, having tracked down the murderous entity which was roaming the country after possessing the body of a young girl unaccounted for after the events. She covers the creature with acid, killing it completely.

====Rawhead Rex====
An ancient, malevolent monster, magically imprisoned underground, is accidentally awakened in a village in [[Kent]]. Rawhead is a nine-foot humanoid with a huge, toothed head, goes on a rampage, killing and eating several townsfolk. He corrupts the local [[verger]], who surrenders to the violent, depraved impulses that Rawhead represents, and who helps the monster slay the [[vicar]], Coot. Rawhead sets the village alight, and is eventually overcome by Ron, father of one of Rawhead's victims, who uses a [[amulet|talisman]] to stall the beast until he is overrun by a mob of enraged villagers. The talisman depicts a pregnant woman, Rawhead's [[antithesis]] and the only thing he fears.

''Rawhead Rex'' has a structure similar to ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' or ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', but uses a disturbing rural setting. The story was later turned into the film ''[[Rawhead Rex (film)|Rawhead Rex]]'' (1986), which Barker has disowned.

====Confessions of a (Pornographer's) Shroud====
Ronnie is a straight-laced Catholic man who is set up to look like the king of a [[pornography]] cartel. He kills some of his enemies, but is murdered by their cohorts. Awakening as a ghost, he possesses the shroud that covers his body in the morgue, and in the shape of the shroud takes revenge on the rest of his enemies. In a gory finale, he enters the mouth of the man responsible for his ordeal and turns him inside out.

Despite containing graphic descriptions of acts of extreme violence, the story is written as a [[black comedy]], revolving around the visual gag of a real ghost looking like someone wearing a bedsheet over his or her head.

====Scape-Goats====
A [[yacht]] is stranded on the beach of a deserted island located at a point in the Atlantic Ocean where converging undersea currents bring all the human bodies of sailors drowned at sea. The hundreds of bodies littering the ocean floor, unfortunately for the stranded crew, aren't as dead as they should be.

====Human Remains====
A young gay prostitute is hired by an [[archaeologist]]. During the course of the night he stumbles into the bathroom to discover a Roman-esque statue of a man lying in the bath. Over the next few weeks, he has the sense of being haunted by a [[doppelgänger]]. At the same time, his mind and body transforms; he becomes cold and lifeless, no longer needing to eat or sleep. He finally discovers his doppelganger, the statue from the bath, at his father's grave, crying in sorrow, as he is unmoved. It becomes clear that the doppelganger has become more convincing as a human than he is, and he wanders away, allowing it to continue living in his persona.

===Volume Four===
====The Inhuman Condition====
A young man named Karney and his friends beat up a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] for fun. Karney steals a strange knotted piece of string he finds on the vagrant. A keen fan of [[puzzles]], Karney undoes the knots that evening, not knowing that in doing so he is releasing a succession of demons who proceed to kill off his friends. The demons seem progressively more advanced, appearing to evolve with each knot. When he realises what he has done, Karney has to seek out the vagrant for help.

====The Body Politic====
In a bizarre version of a revolution, it appears that all our hands have their own [[consciousness]] and are not happy at being ordered what to do by their owners. The hands of a factory worker named Charlie plan to lead the revolution. Charlie's hands even have their own personalities, with Left being more cautious and Right being very determined and even proclaiming himself a [[Messiah]]. Right – against Charlie's own wishes – chops off Left, who scuttles away to summon other hands to do the same before returning to rescue Right, starting an unfortunate revolution for the population. 

This book was later adapted and used, in part, for the film ''[[Quicksilver Highway]]''.

====Revelations====
A woman named Virginia is unwillingly taken on a tour of the U.S. by her unfeeling husband, a preacher named John Gyer. They stay at a [[motel]] which is visited by the ghosts of Buck and Sadie, a married couple who stayed there. In the same room, 30 years before, Sadie murdered Buck and was subsequently put to death for the murder. Buck and Sadie find that Virginia has the ability to both see and hear them. Meanwhile, a scuffle ensues when John discovers their driver, Earl, has been giving Virginia pills to help her deal with her anxiety issues. While looking for Earl to confront him about the pills, John finds the married driver in bed with the daughter of the motel owner, Laura-May. Virginia ends up getting her hands on the same murder weapon used by Sadie 30 years prior, which Laura-May has kept as a souvenir. Virginia uses the gun to try to kill Buck's ghost, who managed partial materialization in order to attempt to [[rape]] her, but the bullet goes through him and finds its way into John's throat,  killing him. Virginia contemplates suicide, but Sadie's ghost advises her to [[insanity plea|plead insanity]]. Whilst being taken in by the local sheriff, someone asks her why she did it. Virginia answers "the Devil made me do it" whilst gazing at the moon with "the craziest smile she (can) muster".

====Down, Satan!====
One of the shortest stories relates the tale of a wealthy middle-aged businessman, Gregorius, who becomes depressed when he believes God has deserted him, and he comes up with a plan to build a [[Hell]] on Earth to summon [[Satan]], believing that God will then sweep him (Gregorius) out of Satan's clutches, and into his heavenly fold. In his vast Satanic Cathedral, Gregorious soon loses sight of his original intention of attracting God's attention, and he is captured after torturing hundreds of people to death in the well-equipped [[torture]] chambers. It is deliberately left ambiguous whether Gregorius went [[insane]], or if he really did succeed in tempting Satan into taking residence in his own personal Hell.

====The Age of Desire====

A private laboratory runs experiments on volunteers to investigate the [[libido]] and try to develop a chemical [[aphrodisiac]]. One of the experiments goes wrong, when a man suddenly goes insane with lust. His perpetual state of arousal erodes his respect for [[morality]] or the law. He rapes, murders, and mutilates one of the scientists and then escapes to cause wanton mayhem, eventually burning himself out and dying.

===Volume Five===
(published in the United States as ''In the Flesh'')

====The Forbidden====
A university student named Helen is doing a [[thesis]] on [[graffiti]], and selects a run-down estate to focus her study. She notices disturbing graffiti in an abandoned building that makes references to an [[urban legend]] known as the Candyman. Further enquiries lead her to believe this is connected with recent murders and mutilations in the neighbourhood, although the locals are seemingly reluctant to discuss the incidents. She eventually encounters the Candyman himself, gaining notoriety by becoming his latest victim. 

This book was later adapted and made into the film ''[[Candyman (film)|Candyman]]''.

====The Madonna====
A man named Jerry is trying to talk a local shady businessman into financing the redevelopment of an old swimming pool complex. However, the pool has some mysterious inhabitants in the form of nude teenage girls who flee should Jerry or his would-be financial backer encounter them. A swimming pool in the centre is unlike the other pools in the building, in that it is full, glows with a strange light, and appears to be inhabited by some misshapen life-form. Curiosity leads Jerry to return to the place, which somehow causes him to wake up one morning to see that he has been transformed into a woman.

====Babel's Children====
After breaking down in the middle of nowhere, a young woman happens across a secluded compound in which the world's greatest minds, a group of elderly scientists and scholars, are responsible for determining the outcome of major world events. They have lived in the complex for many years and by this point their decisions have degenerated to being made solely via games of chance. Chaos ensues when the woman and the men seek to flee the compound. They end up getting in a car accident, and all the elders are killed with the exception of the single one who refused to go along. The woman is forced to participate in the games of chance with him until replacements can be found.

====In The Flesh====
A prison inmate named Cleve gets a new cellmate, a mysterious young man called Billy, who admits that he committed a crime with the sole intention of coming to this particular prison. Billy believes he has been summoned there by his grandfather, a supposedly powerful sorcerer who was buried in the prison after his execution for murder years before. Billy's efforts to summon his grandfather Tait's spirit cause Cleve to be haunted by dreams in which he travels to a form of [[purgatory]] for murderers, where killers are obliged to spend some portion of their [[after life]] in a replica of the scene of their crime. In the end, Billy vanishes from his cell. His grandfather's coffin is exhumed and found to contain Billy curled up next to his grandfather's corpse. Once released, Cleve finds that his travels to the murderer's purgatory have left him with the ability to hear other people's thoughts, as long as they revolve around killing people. He becomes disillusioned with humanity and becomes a [[heroin]] addict to suppress his newfound powers. Cleve later commits a murder himself to feed his habit, and is shot dead by the police. He spends an indeterminate amount of time in his own murderer's purgatory, before discovering that individuals can escape via [[reincarnation]].

===Volume Six===
(several of these stories are also published in ''[[Cabal (novella)|Cabal]]'')

==== The Life of Death ====
Following a brush with cancer and a subsequent [[hysterectomy]], a woman named Elaine becomes fascinated by a church that is being demolished. She encounters a cheerfully morbid man named Kavanagh, who shares her fascination. The demolition soon reveals a tomb of [[Bubonic plague|plague]] victims that had been fermenting for centuries, and Elaine breaks in at night to view the bodies. Later, when her friends begin to die off and the police come after her, Elaine takes refuge with Kavanagh, who she firmly believes, due to his mysterious personality and skeletal features, to be [[Death (personification)|Death]]. It turns out Kavanagh is only a [[serial killer]] and [[necrophile]]; he strangles and rapes Elaine. As her soul flees her body, Elaine feels a sick sort of glee when she realizes that Kavanagh will now be the carrier of the plague she contracted in the tomb, and will spread it far and wide.

====How Spoilers Bleed====
Several European [[mercenary|mercenaries]], led by a cold-hearted man named Locke, have bought land in the [[jungles]] of [[South America]] that it is inhabited by a tribe of [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] natives. When the tribe refuse to leave, one of Locke's cohorts impulsively shoots one of them dead accidentally. The elder of the tribe puts a curse on the men which, one by one, strikes them down with a gruesome condition that makes their bodies incredibly delicate; a mote of dust can slice their skin open, the soles of their feet crack when they stand. After his men die off, Locke goes back to the tribe to beg for forgiveness. However, when he gets there, the tribe has been massacred by some of his other colleagues. Locke begins to suffer the symptoms of the deadly curse just as he realises there is now no way of having it removed.

==== Twilight at the Towers ====
A British spy named Ballard stationed in [[Berlin]] meets with a [[KGB]] counterpart named Mironenko. After their meet, Mironenko disappears. Ballard witnesses a vicious mauling, then soon learns that he and Mironenko are both [[werewolf|werewolves]], trained by each agency to defeat the other. Both governments raid their meeting place, causing Mironenko to transform fully. Ballard runs and wakes up in a fellow operative's house. Ballard's rival, Suckling, arrives and kills the agent, only to be killed by the transformed Ballard. Ballard seeks Mironenko, and finds him preaching to a group of wolves, verbally preparing them to overthrow humankind.

====The Last Illusion====
Private investigator [[Harry D'Amour]] takes a strange case where a magician named Swann has been killed under mysterious circumstances. D'Amour is recruited by Swann's wife to watch over his body so he can be [[cremation|cremated]] in line with a letter written before his death. Almost immediately, D'Amour is drawn into a battle with demons from the underworld seeking to claim Swann's body due to a deal he made with them which gave him the magical powers he possessed. With the assistance of Swann's underling Valentin, who is secretly a demon himself, D'Amour fights off the demons desiring Swann's body and manages to cremate it, but not before Swann performs one last magical act. 

This story was later adapted by Barker himself into the film ''[[Lord of Illusions]]''.

====On Jerusalem Street (a postscript)====
Only included in some UK editions of the ''Books of Blood'', "On Jerusalem Street" is a sequel to "The Book of Blood" from Volume One told as a sort of wrap-around tale. Wyburd is hired to obtain the Book of Blood for a collector. He captures and skins Simon McNeal. Later, the skin starts to bleed and won't stop, and Wyburd eventually drowns. He ends up on the highways of the dead, where he tells his story. 

This story, along with the prologue from Volume One, was adapted and directed into the film ''Book of Blood'' by John Harrison.

'''Broadway by the Bay''', is a community-based musical theatre company located in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and performing in [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]]. It also provides a "Theatre Arts Academy" offering performing arts experiences to local children. After beginning in with productions of three annual [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] productions, the company shifted its focus to modern musicals in 1966.  Since then, it has produced musicals continuously in [[San Mateo County]].  In 1983, the group changed its name to '''Peninsula Civic Light Opera''', and again in 1999, to Broadway by the Bay.

==History==
Broadway by the Bay is an outgrowth of a San Mateo Recreation Department program that originated in the 1950s as "La Honda Music Camp", in Jones Gulch, near [[La Honda, California|La Honda]], California in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. Each summer, that program employed the talents of young musicians, singers, and actors to produce primarily [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s comic operas, which were staged at the camp site in Jones Gulch near [[La Honda, California]].&lt;ref name=SFGate&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140913054936/http://events.sfgate.com/performers/show/7842605-broadway-by-the-bay "Broadway by the Bay"], SFGate.com, accessed September 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1963, the San Mateo Recreation Department established the '''San Mateo Community Theatre''', with Dr. Randolph Hunt (1925-2011) as music director and Robert Lynch as drama director, at [[Hillsdale High School (San Mateo, California)|Hillsdale High School]] in [[San Mateo, California]].&lt;ref name=SFGate/&gt; Dr. Randolph Hunt and Robert Lynch were the directors for the first two summer productions at [[Hillsdale High School (San Mateo, California)|Hillsdale High School]], both of which were Gilbert and Sullivan operas.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

===First productions: Gilbert and Sullivan===
The first production was ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', in August 1963 in the little theatre at Hillsdale High School, with an additional performance at La Honda Music Camp.  The cast of high school and college students included a future international opera singer, soprano [[Luana De Vol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luanadevol.com/ Luana De Vol website]&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt conducted a small orchestra of musicians from [[San Mateo County]].{{cn|date=May 2014}}  In the summer of 1964, Hunt and Lynch collaborated on ''[[The Mikado]]'', again at Hillsdale High School with an additional performance at the camp.{{cn|date=May 2014}} In 1965, Anthony "Duke" Campagne, the band director at Hillsdale High School, worked with Lynch on a production of ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', which played at Hillsdale and one performance at La Honda Music Camp.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

===Move to musical theatre===
[[Image:GordonDeVol.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the cast of the 1966 production of ''Oklahoma!'']]
After presenting the three Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the San Mateo Community Theatre moved in a different direction.  Although Campagne returned, he was joined by a staff that included Kenneth L. Ton, the drama director at [[Capuchino High School]], and Ben Denton, the choral director at [[Aragon High School]]. For the first time, in 1966, SMCT presented a classic Broadway musical: ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' by [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]].  Once again, the cast and orchestra were drawn from high school and college students throughout San Mateo County.  The performances were moved to the little theater at the [[College of San Mateo]].  The production was a success and encouraged SMCT to produce more musicals.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Nylund&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt returned as a director for the 1967 production of ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Stephen Sondheim]].  The performances were given at the auditorium at [[San Mateo High School]], later known as the San Mateo Performing Arts Center.  This remained the home of the company until 2011. The company continued to produce musicals each year, and later productions mixed professional and semi-professional talent with amateur singers and dancers, increasing the quality of the shows.&lt;ref name=officialwebsite&gt;[http://www.broadwaybythebay.org BroadwayByTheBay.org|Broadway by the Bay website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The San Mateo Community Theatre became a non-profit organization in 1978. In 1983, the Board of Directors expanded the focus of the company and changed the name to '''Peninsula Civic Light Opera'''.  In 1999, a decision was made to gradually change the name to '''Broadway by the Bay''' to more accurately reflect the group's focus on Broadway-type musicals instead of light operas.&lt;ref name=SFGate/&gt;

==Broadway by the Bay today==
Broadway by the Bay is a not-for-profit corporation that produces four full-scale musical theatre productions each year. The Actors, ushers and some of the musicians are volunteers.&lt;ref name=SFGate/&gt;

In 2010, composer-lyricist [[Jason Robert Brown]] offered classes and performed a concert to help fundraise for Broadway by the Bay's Youth Theatre Conservatory, which offers performing arts experiences to local children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Violinist-takes-top-prize-in-Klein-competition-3261563.php|title=Violinist takes top prize in Klein competition|last=Hurwitt|first=Robert|date=2010-06-16|work=SFGate|access-date=2017-03-29|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Broadway by the Bay moved to the Fox Theatre located at 2215 Broadway Street in [[Redwood City]], California and it has been performing there ever since.&lt;ref name="FiveYearLease"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.foxrwc.com/blog/?Tech-Meets-Hollywood-at-Premiere-of-HBO-s-Silicon-Valley-4|title=Fox Theatre Signs Five-Year Lease with Broadway By the Bay|date=2016-10-16| website=Foxrwc.com| access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company's 2014 season included performances of ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'', ''[[In the Heights]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Cy Ashley. [http://www.starkinsider.com/2014/07/in-the-heights-review-broadway-bay.html "Broadway by the Bay: ''In the Heights'' (Review)"], StarkInsider.com, July 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dreamgirls (musical)|Dreamgirls]]'', and ''[[Anything Goes]]''.  The 2015 season included ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'', ''West Side Story'', ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', and more.&lt;ref name="officialwebsite" /&gt;  A review in ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' called the company's 2009 production of ''[[The Full Monty (musical)|The Full Monty]]'' "strong and fast-paced ... typical of Broadway by the Bay.  [Its choreography was] smooth, clever, and wonderfully funny. There is much good acting, singing and dancing."&lt;ref&gt;Grant, John Angell. [http://www.mercurynews.com/peninsula/ci_13417504 "Theater review: ''The Full Monty'' at Broadway by the Bay"], ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', September 2009, accessed September 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Broadway by the Bay signed a five year lease at the Fox Theatre.&lt;ref name="FiveYearLease" /&gt;

The '''''Cristo Yacente (Dead Christ) of El Pardo''''', is a life-size polychromed sculpture by Spanish sculptor [[Gregorio Fernández]], executed between 1614 and 1615. Housed in a chapel of the Capuchin Monastery of [[El Pardo]] (Madrid), the sculpture was commissioned by King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] to celebrate the birth of his son Philip IV.

The ''Cristo yacente of El Pardo'' is the most famous of the fourteen ''"Cristos"'' produced by Fernández and his workshop.

As  devotional images, many of them were processed during [[Holy Week]] with other “[[paso]]s” (elaborate religious floats adorned with sculptures depicting scenes from the Passion of Christ). All these images were created in accordance with [[Counter-Reformation]] ideology that required realism in religious images to impress and move the believer.

The '''crowns of Gaya''' refers to two excavated pieces that are believed to be the headgear of the elite of the [[Gaya Confederacy]].  These crowns share the general traditions of Korean crowns, such as the use of diadems, which follows the tradition of the [[Crown of Baekje|Baekje]] and the use of headbands with uprights, most notably used in the [[Crown of Silla|crowns of Silla]].  However, the Gaya crowns are obviously distinctive from the traditions of the [[Silla]] and [[Baekje]] and shows that the Gaya people enjoyed an independent culture.

==National Treasure No.138==
[[Image:Gold Crown access NT138.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Gold crown and accessories. National Treasure No.138.]]
The '''Geumgwan mit busok geumgu''' refers to a collection of artifacts including a gold [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] and its accompanying accessories, finger rings, and earrings.  The crown is currently housed at the [[Hoam Art Museum]].  This artifact, along with its accompanying accessories, was designated as a [[National treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]] on December 21, 1971.  The crown is believed to be from the fifth or sixth century CE and the crown measures {{convert|11.5|cm|in|frac=6|abbr=off}} in height, {{convert|3.6|cm|in|frac=6|abbr=off}} in width, and {{convert|20.7|cm|in|frac=6|abbr=off}} in diameter.

The crown has three distinctive parts.  The headband is made of gold.  It is decorated with tiny gold mirrors which are attached to the band.  The band itself is incised with dotted decorations running on the top and bottom in a diamond motif.  Attached to the band are jade [[gogok]].  However, whether these beads were supposed to be on the headband is still debated because they were apparently not found on the crown when it was excavated.  

The appendages of the crown are placed equidistant from each other on the circular headband.  These appendages look similar to [[fleur de lis]] symbol but are more often described as grass-shaped or floral-shaped.  Each appendage is identical and has three sets of prongs flowing downward at a right angle and is topped with a jewel-shaped finial.  These appendages resemble a crown of Baekje which also had flowing floral-like patterns instead of the stylistic crowns of Silla.  

Finally, the crown came with four floral-shaped ornaments which were probably used as diadems.  Jade [[gogok]] were attached to the gold ornaments as well as tiny gold disks.  It is believed that these ornaments follow Silla styles and are also incised with dots in a diamond motif like the headband of the crown.

'''''Donnie Darko''''' is a 2001 American [[science fiction film]] written and directed by [[Richard Kelly (director)|Richard Kelly]]. It stars [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Jena Malone]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Katharine Ross]], [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Noah Wyle]], and [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]]. The film follows the adventures of the troubled title character as he seeks the meaning behind his [[Doomsday event|doomsday]]-related visions.

Filmed over the course of 28 days (coincidentally mirroring the time transpired in the movie), the film was almost released [[straight-to-video]].&lt;ref name="'Darko' takes a long, strange trip"&gt;{{cite news |title = 'Darko' takes a long, strange trip |url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-02-14-dvd-donnie-darko_x.htm |publisher = [[USA Today]] |first1=Mike |last1=Snider |date=2005-02-14 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Donnie Darko'' was screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 19, 2001, before receiving a limited theatrical release on October 26, 2001 by [[Flower Films]]. Due to the film's advertising featuring a crashing plane and the [[September 11 attacks]] that transpired a month before, the film was scarcely advertised. In the end, ''Donnie Darko'' grossed just over $7.5 million worldwide on a budget of $4.5 million.&lt;ref name="numbers" /&gt; Despite its lackluster box office performance, ''Donnie Darko'' received critical acclaim. Critics lauded the film's story, acting, and tone. The film was listed #2 in ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s 50 Greatest Independent Films of All Time,&lt;ref name="empireonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.empireonline.com/features/50greatestindependent/2.asp|title=50 Greatest Independent Films of All Time|accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as #63 in ''Empire'''s 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.empireonline.com/500/88.asp|title=Empire's 500 Greatest Movies Of All Time|accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] in March 2002. The film became a surprising success on the home video market, reportedly grossing over $10 million in home video sales. The film has developed a [[cult following]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-new-cult-canon-donnie-darko,2179/|title= The New Cult Canon: Donnie Darko|author=Scott Tobias |date=2008-02-21 |publisher = The Onion | work = [[The A.V. Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's soundtrack is also famous for its cover of [[Tears for Fears]]'s "[[Mad World]]" by [[Gary Jules]] and [[Michael Andrews (musician)|Michael Andrews]]. The cover reached number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and stayed there for three consecutive weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/gary-jules-3-1373002|title=IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD!|date=4 January 2004|work=[[NME]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song achieved lukewarm success in the United States, reaching number 30 on the ''Billboard'' [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. A [[Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut|director's cut]] was released in 2004, on a two-disc special edition [[DVD]].&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"&gt;{{Rotten Tomatoes|id=donnie_darko|title=Donnie Darko}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stage adaptation appeared in 2007, and a sequel, ''[[S. Darko]]'', in 2009.

==Plot==
On October 2, 1988, troubled teenager Donald "Donnie" Darko is woken up and beckoned outside by a mysterious voice. Once outside, he meets a figure in a monstrous rabbit costume who introduces himself as "Frank" and tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. Donnie wakes up the next morning on the green of a local golf course and returns home to discover a [[jet engine]] has crashed into his bedroom. His older sister Elizabeth tells him the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] investigators do not know its origin.

Over the next several days, Donnie continues to have visions of Frank, and his parents Eddie and Rose send him to [[psychotherapist]] Dr. Thurman. Thurman believes Donnie is detached from reality, and that his visions of Frank are "[[hallucination|daylight hallucinations]]," symptomatic of [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. Frank asks Donnie if he believes in [[time travel]], who, in turn, asks his science teacher Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff. Monnitoff gives Donnie ''The Philosophy of Time Travel'', a book written by Roberta Sparrow, a former science teacher at the school who is now a seemingly senile old woman living outside of town. Donnie also starts seeing Gretchen Ross, who has recently moved into town with her mother under a new identity to escape her violent stepfather.

Frank begins to influence Donnie's actions, including causing him to flood his high school by breaking a water main. Gym teacher Kitty Farmer attributes the act of vandalism to the influence of the short story "[[The Destructors]]", assigned by dedicated English teacher Karen Pomeroy. Kitty begins teaching “attitude lessons” taken from local [[motivational speaker]] Jim Cunningham, but Donnie rebels against these, leading to friction between Kitty and Rose. Kitty arranges for Cunningham to speak at a school assembly, where Donnie insults him. He later finds Cunningham's wallet and address, and Frank suggests setting his house on fire. Firefighters discover a hoard of [[child pornography]] there. Cunningham is arrested, and Kitty, who wishes to testify in his defense, asks Rose to chaperone their daughters’ dance troupe on its trip to Los Angeles.

With Rose and little sister Samantha in Los Angeles, and Eddie away for business, Donnie and Elizabeth hold a [[Halloween]] costume party to celebrate Elizabeth's acceptance to [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. At the party, Gretchen arrives distraught as her mother has gone missing, and she and Donnie have sex for the first time. When Donnie realizes that Frank's [[Prophecy|prophesied]] end of the world is only hours away, he takes Gretchen and two other friends to see Sparrow. Instead of Sparrow, they find two high school bullies, Seth and Ricky, who were trying to rob Sparrow's home. Donnie, Seth, and Ricky get into a fight in the road in front of her house, just as Sparrow was returning home. An oncoming car swerves to avoid Sparrow and runs over Gretchen, killing her. The driver turns out to be Elizabeth's boyfriend, Frank Anderson, wearing the same rabbit costume from Donnie's visions. Donnie shoots Frank in the eye with his father's gun, and walks home carrying Gretchen’s body.

Donnie returns home as a vortex forms over his house. He borrows one of his parent’s cars, loads Gretchen’s body into it, and drives to a nearby ridge that overlooks town. There, he watches as the plane carrying Rose and the dance troupe home from Los Angeles gets caught in the vortex’s wake, which violently rips off one of its engines, and sends it back in time. Events of the previous 28 days unwind. Donnie wakes up in his bedroom, recognizes the date is October 2, and laughs as the jet engine falls into his bedroom, crushing him. Around town, those whose lives Donnie would have touched wake up from troubled dreams. Gretchen rides by the Darko home the next morning, and learns of Donnie's death. Gretchen and Rose exchange glances and wave as if they know each other, but cannot remember where.

==Production==
Although the film was always meant to be set in 1988, Kelly admitted he felt pressured to make the setting more contemporary; but, he couldn't figure out how to make the story work in such a setting and retained the original setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Cranswick | first=Ami | title=Exclusive Interview with Donnie Darko writer/director Richard Kelly | url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2016/12/exclusive-interview-with-donnie-darko-writerdirector-richard-kelly/ | website=Flickering Myth | accessdate=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with BBC, Kelly said he "set out to write something ambitious, personal, and nostalgic about the late 80s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Korsner|first1=Jason|title=Donnie Darko Interview|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/10/21/richard_kelly_donnie_darko_interview.shtml|accessdate=January 19, 2018|work=BBC|date=October 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank, the giant rabbit, was inspired by the novel ''[[Watership Down]]'', with the novel's censorship being a plot point before being abandoned in the final version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Susman|first1=Gary|title=25 Things You May Not Know About 'Donnie Darko'|url=https://www.moviefone.com/2011/10/26/25-things-you-may-not-know-about-donnie-darko/|website=Moviefone|accessdate=21 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222051340/https://www.moviefone.com/2011/10/26/25-things-you-may-not-know-about-donnie-darko/ |archive-date=22 December 2017 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer information has shown the costume could also have been an inspiration from a dream Kelly had.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=THE BUNNY SUIT|last=Coggan|first=Devan|date=7 April 2017|work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
''Donnie Darko'' was filmed in 28 days which, by coincidence, virtually matches the time that transpires in the film from October 2, 1988, to the Friday or Saturday weekend party before Halloween on Monday, October 31, 1988.&lt;ref name="DCDVD" /&gt;  The budget for the film was $4.5 million.&lt;ref name="DCDVD" /&gt;

It almost went straight to home video, but was theatrically released by Drew Barrymore's production company, [[Flower Films]].&lt;ref name="'Darko' takes a long, strange trip"/&gt;

Some scenes were shot in Bixby Knolls Virginia Country Club, in Long Beach, [[California]], with many of the school sequences shot at [[Loyola High School (Los Angeles, California)|Loyola High School]]. The "Carpathian Ridge" scenes were shot on the [[Angeles Crest Highway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Poster, Steven (Cinematographer) |title=Donnie Darko Production Diary |medium=DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Donnie Darko (soundtrack)}}
In 2003, the piano-driven cover of [[Tears for Fears]]' "[[Mad World]]" featured in the film, as part of the end sequence, was a hit for composer [[Michael Andrews (musician)|Michael Andrews]] and singer [[Gary Jules]], topping the charts in the United Kingdom and Portugal.&lt;ref name="indiewire"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brunett |first=Adam |date=2004-07-22 |website=[[Indie Wire]] |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/donnie_darko_the_directors_cut_the_strange_afterlife_of_an_indie_cult_film |title=Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut: The Strange Afterlife of an Indie Cult Film |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One continuous sequence involving an introduction of Donnie's high school prominently features the song "[[Head over Heels (Tears for Fears song)|Head over Heels]]", by [[Tears for Fears]], Samantha's dance group, "Sparkle Motion", performs with the song "[[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|Notorious]]", by [[Duran Duran]], and "[[Under the Milky Way]]", by [[The Church (band)|The Church]], is played after Donnie and Gretchen emerge from his room during the party. "[[Love Will Tear Us Apart]]", by [[Joy Division]], also appears in the film [[diegesis|diegetically]] during the party and shots of Donnie and Gretchen upstairs. The version included was released in 1995, although the film is set in 1988. The opening sequence is set to "[[The Killing Moon]]" by [[Echo &amp; the Bunnymen]].&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://film.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/12415/donnie-darko-directors-cut.html|title=''Donnie Darko'': Director's Cut|first=Matt|last=Day|date=10 August 2004|publisher=The Digital Fix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the re-released [[director's cut]], the music in the opening sequence is replaced by "[[Never Tear Us Apart]]" by [[INXS]]; "[[Under the Milky Way]]" is moved to the scene of Donnie and Eddie driving home from Donnie's meeting with his therapist; and "The Killing Moon" is played as Gretchen and Donnie return to the party from Donnie's parents' room.&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt;

==Release==
The film had a [[limited release]], opening October 26, the month following the [[September 11 attacks]]. It was subsequently held back for almost a year for international release. Kelly said it took almost six months to sell the movie. "It almost went directly to the [[Starz|Starz network]]. We had to beg them to put it in theaters. [[Filmmaker]] [[Christopher Nolan]] stepped in and convinced [[Newmarket Films|Newmarket]] to put it in theaters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/14/donnie-darko-richard-kelly-donald-trump|title=Donnie Darko director Richard Kelly: 'Sometimes films need time to marinate'|first=Dave|last=Schilling|date=November 14, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=January 26, 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
''The Donnie Darko Book'', written by Richard Kelly, is a 2003 book about the film. It includes an introduction by Jake Gyllenhaal, the screenplay of the ''[[Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut]]'', an in-depth interview with Kelly, facsimile pages from the ''Philosophy of Time Travel'', photos and drawings from the film, and artwork it inspired. [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]] released first a six-inch (15&amp;nbsp;cm) figure of Frank the Bunny and later a foot-tall (30&amp;nbsp;cm) "talking version" of the same figure.

===Home media===
The film was originally released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] in March 2002. Strong DVD sales led [[Newmarket Films]] to release a "[[Director's cut|Director's Cut]]" on DVD in 2004. Bob Berney, President of Newmarket Films, has described the film as "a runaway hit on DVD," citing United States sales of more than $10 million.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The film was released in the U.S. on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on February 10, 2009, containing both versions. The movie was then re-released on July 26, 2011 as a four-disc, 10th anniversary edition, once again containing both versions in HD, and the theatrical version on DVD.

The film was released as a 2-disc Blu-ray special edition in the UK on July 19, 2010, by Metrodome Distribution, and featuring both Original and Director's Cut. It also included commentaries from director Kelly and actor Gyllenhaal, Kelly and [[Kevin Smith]], and cast and crew, including Drew Barrymore.

In December 2016, [[Arrow Films]] released a limited edition [[4K resolution]] Blu-ray of the film in the UK, supervised and approved by director Kelly. This release includes both the Director's and Theatrical cuts and was accompanied by a [[Dual format]] Blu-ray and DVD release.&lt;ref&gt;The Dual Format Blu-ray and DVD release arrived on December 12th&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, it was released in April 2017.

===Director's cut===
{{Main|Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut}}
''Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut'' was released on May 29, 2004, in [[Seattle, Washington]], at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], and later in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]], on July 23, 2004. The tickets sold out within the day for the Seattle International Film Festival premiere, grossing nearly $33,000 over a five-day period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=AFTER DARK|last=Valby|first=Karen|date=18 June 2004|work=Entertainment Weekly|last2=Flynn|first2=Gillian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cut includes twenty minutes of extra footage and an altered soundtrack.

The director's cut DVD was released on February 15, 2005 in single- and double-disc versions, the latter being available in a standard DVD case or in a limited edition that also features a [[Lenticular lens|lenticular]] slipcase, whose central image alternates between Donnie and Frank depending on the viewing angle. Most additional features are exclusive to the two-DVD set: the director's commentary assisted by [[Kevin Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Commentary with Kevin Smith | title = Donnie Darko Directors Cut | publisher = Faber and Faber | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-571-22124-6 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; excerpts from the storyboard, a 52-minute production diary, "#1 fan video", a "cult following" video interviewing English fans, and the new director's cut trailer. The single-DVD edition was also released as a giveaway with copies of the British ''Sunday Times'' newspaper on February 19, 2006.

The DVD of the Director's Cut includes text of the in-universe fictional book, ''The Philosophy of Time Travel'', written by Roberta Sparrow, which Donnie is given and reads in the film.&lt;ref name="POTT"&gt;[http://www.donniedarko.org.uk/philosphy-of-time-travel/ Text of ''The Philosophy of Time Travel'']&lt;/ref&gt; The text expands on the philosophical and scientific concepts much of the film's plot revolves around, and has been seen as a way to understand the film better than from its theatrical release.&lt;ref name=Everything/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Donnie-Darko-The-Director-s-Cut-631.html|title=Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut - CINEMABLEND|date=May 27, 2016|work=cinemablend.com|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/01/24/donnie-darko-the-directors-cut|title=Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut|first=Mike|last=Drucker|date=January 24, 2005|work=ign.com|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As outlined by ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''{{'}}s Dan Kois from the book's text, much of the film takes place in an unstable Tangent Universe that is connected to the Primary Universe and a duplicate of it, except for an extra metal vessel known as an Artifact&amp;nbsp;— the plane engine. If the Artifact is not sent to the Primary Universe by the chosen Living Receiver (Donnie) within 28 days, the Primary Universe will be destroyed upon collapse of the Tangent. To aid in this task, the Living Receiver is given super-human abilities such as foresight, physical strength and elemental powers, but at the cost of troubling visions and paranoia, while the Manipulated Living (all who live around the Receiver) support him in unnatural ways, setting up a [[domino effect|domino-like chain of events]] encouraging him to return the Artifact. The Manipulated Dead (those who die within the Tangent Universe, like Frank and Gretchen) are more aware than the Living, having the power to travel through time, and will set an Ensurance Trap, a scenario which leaves the Receiver no choice but to save the Primary Universe.&lt;ref name=Everything&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://www.salon.com/2004/07/23/darko/ | title = Everything you were afraid to ask about "Donnie Darko" | first = Dan | last = Kois | date = 2004-07-23 | accessdate = 2013-06-19 | publisher = [[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its poor box office showing, the film began to attract a devoted fan base. It was originally released on VHS and DVD in March 2002. During this time, the Pioneer Theatre in [[New York City]]'s [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] began [[Midnight movie|midnight screenings]] of ''Donnie Darko'' that continued for 28 consecutive months.&lt;ref name="indiewire" /&gt; In the United Kingdom, ''Donnie Darko'' sold 300,000 tickets within the first six weeks of its release, based mostly on [[word-of-mouth marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, Danny (29 July 2004).

[[Metacritic]] gives the theatrical version of the film a score of 71 out of 100, based on 21 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews", whereas the director's cut received a much higher score of 88 out of 100, based on 15 reviews, which indicates "universal acclaim".&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web|work=Metacritic|title=Donnie Darko|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/donnie-darko-the-directors-cut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Johnston (critic)|Andrew Johnson]] cited the film in ''[[Us Weekly]]'', as one of the outstanding films at Sundance in 2001, describing it as "a heady blend of science fiction, spirituality, and teen angst."&lt;ref&gt;''Us Weekly'', 2/21/2001, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Oppenheimer of ''New Times (LA)'' praised the film, saying, "Like gathering storm clouds, ''Donnie Darko'' creates an atmosphere of eerie calm and mounting menace—[and] stands as one of the most exceptional movies of 2001."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/park_city_2001_review_donnie_darko_plays_with_the_time_of_our_lives |title=PARK CITY 2001 REVIEW: Donnie Darko Plays with the Time of Our Lives |author=Andy Bailey |date=2001-01-21 |publisher=[[Indie Wire]] |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ABC Australia, Megan Spencer called the movie "menacing, dreamy, [and] exciting" and noted "it could take you to a deeply emotional place lying dormant in your soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/review/film/s702145.htm|title=Donnie Darko: triple j film reviews|author=Megan Spencer|date=2002-10-15|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the theatrical version of the film two and a half stars out of four, but later gave the director's cut three stars out of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut |url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/donnie-darko-the-directors-cut-2004 |author=[[Roger Ebert]] |accessdate=2012-08-31 |work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
{{main|S. Darko}}
A 2009 [[sequel]], ''[[S. Darko]]'', centers on Sam, Donnie's younger sister. Sam begins to have strange dreams that hint at a major catastrophe. ''Donnie Darko'' creator [[Richard Kelly (director)|Richard Kelly]] has said he had no involvement in the sequel, as he does not own the rights to the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/13/arcade-fire-open-box|title=Arcade Fire Open Box: Richard Kelly on film score and Darko sequel |author=Chris Tilly |date=2008-05-13 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chase and producer [[Adam Fields]] were the only creative links between it and the original film. The sequel received extremely negative reviews.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/s-darko,27924/|title=S. Darko |author=Josh Modell |date=2009-05-13 |publisher=[[The A.V. Club]] |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview published on January 24, 2017, Kelly revealed there's a movie set in the world of ''Donnie Darko'' he wants to make, that would be much bigger and more ambitious than the original. Because of the large budget required, Kelly said he will look into securing the necessary resources, once he finishes with his next film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmv.com/video/richard-kelly-talks-reissuing-donnie-darko-and-his-plans-for-a-much-bigger-and-more-ambitious-sequel|title=Richard Kelly talks reissuing Donnie Darko and his plans for a "much bigger and more ambitious" sequel|work=hmv.com|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[PopMatters]]'' magazine journalist J.C. Maçek III director [[Richard Kelly (director)|Richard Kelly]] said regarding the sequel ''[[S. Darko]]'', "I hate it when people ask me about that sequel because" he laughs, morosely, "I had nothing to do with it. And I hate it when people try and blame me or hold me responsible for it because I had no [involvement]. I don’t control the underlying rights to [the Donnie Darko franchise]. I had to relinquish them when I was 24-years old. I hate when people ask me about that because I’ve never seen it and I never will, so… don’t ask me about the sequel." He adds with a cynical laugh, "Those people are making lots of money. They’re certainly making lots of money."&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=Mainstream Darko: Director Richard Kelly on Building His Own Sandbox|date=3 April 2017|author=Maçek III, J.C.|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/mainstream-darko-richard-kelly-interview-donnie-darko/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked if he would ever do an official sequel, Kelly responded, "I’m open to doing something much bigger and longer and more ambitious that could be a new story." He added, "We’ll see what happens. I have a lot of stuff that I’m working on and it’s ambitious and it’s expensive and we’ll see what happens."&lt;ref name=D/&gt;

==Adaptations==
[[Marcus Stern (theatre director)|Marcus Stern]], associate director of the [[American Repertory Theater]], directed a stage adaptation of ''Donnie Darko'' at the Zero Arrow Theatre, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], in the fall of 2007. It ran from October 27 until November 18, 2007, with opening night scheduled near Halloween.

An article written by the production drama team says the director and production team planned to "embrace the challenge to make the fantastical elements come alive on stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.americanrepertorytheater.org/inside/articles/articles-vol-6-i1c-end-world| title = Bringing the End of the World to Life| author = Sarah Wallace| publisher = [[American Repertory Theatre]]| date = 2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Stern adapted and directed Kelly's screenplay for a graduate student production at the American Repertory Theatre's [[Institute for Advanced Theater Training]] (I.A.T.T./M.X.A.T.).

Starting in the 18th century, ideas of aesthetic pleasure have tried to define "taste". [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[David Hume|Hume]] both argued that there was universal good taste, which made aesthetic pleasure. A feminist line of logic about these attempts is that, because [[fine art]] was a leisure activity at this time, those who could afford to make art or produce supposed universal truths about how it is enjoyed would do so in a way that creates class and sex division.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; Even when those universal aesthetists did address gender, they categorized aesthetics into two categories: [[beauty]] and [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]]; with beauty being small and delicate (feminine) and sublimity being large and awe-inspiring (masculine).&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; Feminist aesthetics analyzes why "feminine" traits are subservient compared to "masculine" traits in art and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415266581|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation for the male-domination of forming aesthetic theory is that feminists express their aesthetic pleasure differently than non-feminist aesthetes for "whom the pleasure of theorizing [...] is a form of [[jouissance]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11581">The '''Fontana Modern Masters''' was a series of pocket guides on writers, [[philosophy|philosophers]], and other thinkers and theorists who shaped the intellectual landscape of the twentieth century. The first five titles were published on 12 January 1970 by Fontana Books, the paperback imprint of [[William Collins (publisher)|William Collins &amp; Co]], and the series editor was [[Frank Kermode]] who was Professor of Modern [[English literature|English Literature]] at [[University College London]]. The books were very popular with students, who 'bought them by the handful' according to Kermode,&lt;ref&gt;Frank Kermode. ''Not Entitled: A Memoir''. London: [[HarperCollins]], 1996, p.224.&lt;/ref&gt; and they were instantly recognisable by their eye-catching covers, which featured brightly coloured abstract art and [[sans-serif]] [[typography]].

== Art as book covers ==

The Fontana Modern Masters occupy a unique place in publishing history - not for their contents but their covers, which draw on the following developments in twentieth-century art and literature:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wire-frame.net/news.html#00007 James Pardey. 'The Shape of the Century'.] ''[[Eye (magazine)|Eye Magazine]]'', Winter 2009, pp.6-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/rwabristol/docs/rwa_art_autumn_2012_www/28?mode=window&amp;backgroundColor=%23222222 James Pardey. 'Oliver Bevan: In Search of Utopia'.] ''[[Royal West of England Academy|RWA Magazine]]'', Autumn 2012, pp.26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Twentieth-century [[geometric abstraction]], [[Color Field|colour-field painting]] and [[hard-edge painting]].
* [[Op art|Op Art]], and in particular the work of [[Victor Vasarely]].
* The English [[beatnik]] [[Brion Gysin|Brion Gysin's]] [[cut-up technique]] as popularized by [[William S. Burroughs|William Burroughs]].

The cover concept was the brainchild of Fontana's art director John Constable, who had been experimenting with a cover treatment based on cut-ups of ''[[The Mud Bath]]'', a key work of British geometric abstraction by the painter [[David Bomberg]]. However, a visit to the Grabowski Gallery in London introduced Constable to the work of [[Oliver Bevan]], a graduate of the [[Royal College of Art]] in 1964, whose optical and geometric paintings were influenced by Vasarely's Op Art. On seeing Bevan's work, Constable commissioned him to create the covers for the first ten Fontana Modern Masters, which Bevan painted as rectilinear arrangements of tesselating blocks. Each cover was thus a piece of abstract art, but as an incentive for readers to buy all ten books the covers could be arranged to create a larger, composite artwork. The 'set of ten' books appeared in 1970-71 but overran when ''Joyce'' was published with the same cover as ''Guevara'':

* ''[[Albert Camus|Camus]]'' by [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], 1970
* ''[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]]'' by [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]], 1970
* ''[[Frantz Fanon|Fanon]]'' by [[David Caute]], 1970
* ''[[Che Guevara|Guevara]]'' by [[Andrew Sinclair]], 1970
* ''[[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]'' by [[Edmund Leach]], 1970
* ''[[György Lukács|Lukács]]'' by [[George Lichtheim]], 1970
* ''[[Herbert Marcuse|Marcuse]]'' by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], 1970
* ''[[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan]]'' by [[Jonathan Miller]], 1971
* ''[[George Orwell|Orwell]]'' by [[Raymond Williams]], 1971
* ''[[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'' by [[David Pears]], 1971
* ''[[James Joyce|Joyce]]'' by [[John Gross]], 1971

A second 'set of ten' featuring a new Bevan cut-up was published in 1971-73 but the inclusion of ''Joyce'' in the first 'set of ten' left this second set one book short:
* ''[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'' by [[Richard Wollheim]], 1971
* ''[[Wilhelm Reich|Reich]]'' by [[Charles Rycroft]], 1971
* ''[[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]]'' by [[Denis Donoghue (academic)|Denis Donoghue]], 1971
* ''[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]'' by [[George Woodcock]], 1972
* ''[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'' by [[Robert Conquest]], 1972
* ''[[Norman Mailer|Mailer]]'' by [[Richard Poirier]], 1972
* ''[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'' by [[Alfred Jules Ayer|A J Ayer]], 1972
* ''[[Carl Jung|Jung]]'' by [[Anthony Storr]], 1973
* ''[[D. H. Lawrence|Lawrence]]'' by Frank Kermode, 1973

A third 'set of ten' featuring Bevan's kinetic ''Pyramid'' painting began to appear in 1973-74 but Constable left before the set was complete and his replacement, [[Mike Dempsey]], scrapped the set-of-ten incentive after eight books:
* ''[[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]'' by [[Al Alvarez|A Alvarez]], 1973
* ''[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'' by [[Jeremy Bernstein]], 1973
* ''[[R. D. Laing|Laing]]'' by [[Edgar Z. Friedenberg]], 1973
* ''[[Karl Popper|Popper]]'' by [[Bryan Magee]], 1973
* ''[[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]'' by [[Erich Heller]], 1974
* ''[[Le Corbusier]]'' by [[Stephen Gardiner (architect)|Stephen Gardiner]], 1974
* ''[[Marcel Proust|Proust]]'' by [[Roger Shattuck]], 1974
* ''[[Max Weber|Weber]]'' by Donald G MacRae, 1974

Dempsey switched the covers to a white background and commissioned a new artist James Lowe, whose cover art for the next eight books in 1975-76 was based on triangles: 
* ''[[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]]'' by [[Stephen Spender]], 1975
* ''[[Karl Marx|Marx]]'' by [[David McLellan (academic)|David McLellan]], 1975
* ''[[Ezra Pound|Pound]]'' by [[Donald Davie]], 1975
* ''[[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]'' by [[Arthur Danto|Arthur C Danto]], 1975
* ''[[Antonin Artaud|Artaud]]'' by [[Martin Esslin]], 1976
* ''[[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]'' by D E Moggridge, 1976
* ''[[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]'' by [[Jonathan Culler]], 1976
* ''[[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'' by [[Charles Rosen]], 1976

Nine more books appeared in 1977-79 with cover art by James Lowe based on squares:
* ''[[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]'' by David McLellan, 1977
* ''[[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]]'' by [[James Joll]], 1977
* ''[[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]]'' by [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]], 1978
* ''[[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'' by [[George Steiner]], 1978
* ''[[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'' by [[J. P. Stern|J P Stern]], 1978
* ''[[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'' by [[Irving Howe]], 1978
* ''[[Melanie Klein|Klein]]'' by [[Hanna Segal]], 1979
* ''[[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'' by [[Jeffrey Alan Gray|Jeffrey A Gray]], 1979
* ''[[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'' by [[Margaret Boden|Margaret A Boden]], 1979

Dempsey left Fontana Books in 1979 but continued to oversee the Modern Masters series until a new art director, Patrick Mortimer, was appointed in 1980. Four more books followed under Mortimer with cover art by James Lowe based on circles:
* ''[[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|Evans-Pritchard]]'' by [[Mary Douglas]], 1980
* ''[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'' by Wilma George, 1982
* ''[[Roland Barthes|Barthes]]'' by [[Jonathan Culler]], 1983
* ''[[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]]'' by [[Martin Jay]], 1984

The cover concept was dropped after this and a new design was used that featured a portrait of the Modern Master as a line drawing or later a tinted photograph, and mixed serif and sans-serif typefaces, upright and italic fonts, block capitals, lowercase letters and faux handwriting. The design was used for reprints and six new titles: 
* ''[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'' by [[José Guilherme Merquior|J G Merquior]], 1985
* ''[[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]'' by [[Christopher Norris (critic)|Christopher Norris]], 1987
* ''[[Donald Winnicott|Winnicott]]'' by [[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]], 1988
* ''[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]'' by [[Malcolm Bowie]], 1991
* ''[[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]]'' by David Watson, 1992
* ''[[Isaiah Berlin|Berlin]]'' by [[John N. Gray|John Gray]], 1995

== Book covers as art ==
Fontana's use of art as book covers went full circle in 2003-05 when the British [[conceptual art]]ist [[Jamie Shovlin]] 'reproduced' the covers of the forty-eight Fontana Modern Masters from ''Camus'' to ''Barthes'' as a series of flawed paintings (the titles are missing and the colours have run) in watercolour and ink on paper, each measuring 28 x 19&amp;nbsp;cm. However, Shovlin also noticed ten forthcoming titles listed on the books' front endpapers which, for reasons unknown, had not been published:

* ''[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]]'' by [[Harold Rosenberg]]
* ''[[Buckminster Fuller|Fuller]]'' by [[Allan Temko]]
* ''[[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson]]'' by [[Thomas Sebeok|Thomas A Sebeok]]
* ''[[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'' by [[Lionel Trilling]]
* ''[[Thomas Mann|Mann]]'' by Lionel Trilling
* ''[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty|Merleau-Ponty]]'' by H P Dreyfus
* ''[[Joseph Needham|Needham]]'' by George Steiner
* ''[[Charles Scott Sherrington|Sherrington]]'' by Jonathan Miller
* ''[[Saul Steinberg|Steinberg]]'' by [[John Hollander]]
* ''Winnicott'' by [[Masud Khan]] (this was published with a different author, as listed in the previous section)

Shovlin then set out to paint these 'lost' titles and thus 'complete' the series. To do this he devised a 'Fontana Colour Chart' based on the covers of the published books, and a scoring system that - like his paintings - was deliberately flawed. Given these flaws, and those in Fontana's original series, the absence of any modern masters from the visual arts is notable,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fontanamodernmasters.org/07.html#Riflemaker Jamie Shovlin. ''Fontana Modern Masters''.] Riflemaker, London, 14 April - 28 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; since ''Matisse'' was one of four 'forthcoming titles' which Shovlin had apparently overlooked:

* ''[[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]'' by [[Samuel Weber]]
* ''[[Erik Erikson|Erikson]]'' by [[Robert Jay Lifton|Robert Lifton]]
* ''[[Ho Chi Minh|Ho]]'' by [[David Halberstam]]
* ''[[Henri Matisse|Matisse]]'' by [[David Sylvester]]

''Benjamin'' and ''Matisse'' have since been included in a new series of seventeen large Fontana Modern Masters that Shovlin painted in 2011-12. These use a similar scoring system to his watercolours of 2003-05 and a new 'Acrylic Variations Colour Wheel'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fontanamodernmasters.org/07.html#HoV Jamie Shovlin. ''Various Arrangements''.] [[Haunch of Venison]], London, 18 April - 26 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings are acrylic on canvas and each measures 210 x 130&amp;nbsp;cm:

* ''Arendt by David Watson (Variation 1)''
* ''Benjamin by Samuel Weber (Variation 3)''
* ''Berlin by John Gray (Variation 1)''
* ''Derrida by Christopher Norris (Variation 3)''
* ''Dostoyevsky by Harold Rosenberg (Variation 1)''

'''Gherasim Luca''' ({{IPA-ro|ɟeraˈsim ˈluka}}; 23 July 1913 – 9 February 1994) was a French-speaking [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] [[theorist]] and [[poet]]. Born '''Salman Locker''' in [[Romania]] and also known as '''Salman Locker''', '''Gherashim Luca''', '''Costea Sar''', and '''Petre Malcoci''', he regarded himself as an apatrid. His entire post-Second World War work is written in French. He is frequently cited in the works of [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]].

== Biography ==

Born in [[Bucharest]] the son of a [[Jew]]ish tailor, Berl Locker (died 1914), he spoke [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[German language|German]], and [[French language|French]]. During 1938, he traveled frequently to [[Paris]] where he was introduced to the Surrealist circles. [[World War II]] and the official [[antisemitism]] in Romania forced him into local [[exile]]. During the short pre-[[Communist Romania|Communist]] period of Romanian independence, he founded a Surrealist artists group, together with [[Gellu Naum]], Paul Păun, Virgil Teodorescu and [[Dolfi Trost]].

His first publications, including poems in French followed. He was the inventor of [[Surrealist techniques#Cubomania|cubomania]] and, with Dolfi Trost, the author of [[surautomatism|the statement "Dialectic of Dialectic"]] in 1945. Harassed in Romania and caught while trying to flee the country, the self-called ''étran-juif'' ("StranJew") finally left Romania in 1952, and moved to Paris through [[Israel]].

There he worked among others with [[Jean Arp]], [[Paul Celan]], François Di Dio and [[Max Ernst]], producing numerous [[collage]]s, drawings, objects, and text-installations. From 1967, his reading sessions took him to places like [[Stockholm]], [[Oslo]], [[Geneva]], [[New York City]], and [[San Francisco]]. The 1988 TV-portrait by Raoul Sanglas, ''Comment s'en sortir sans sortir'', made him famous for a larger readership.

In 1994, he was expelled from his apartment in Montmartre. Luca had spent forty years in France without papers and  could not cope. On February 9, at the age of 80, he committed suicide by jumping into the [[Seine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookforum.com/inprint/016_01/3558|title=The Passive Vampire|last=Gammel|first=Irene|publisher=Bookforum|accessdate=13 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selected works ==

Luca initially wrote most of his poetic works in his native Romanian. Two collections of these, ''Inventatorul Iubirii'' and ''Un lup văzut printr-o lupă,'' published in Bucharest in 1945, were translated into English (''The Inventor of Love and Other Works'') by Julian and Laura Semilian and published by Black Widow Press in 2009.

With the authorisation of éditions Corti, a forthcoming chapbook of his poems translated by [[Fiona Sze-Lorrain]] will be featured in "Poetry International", Issue no. 15, Spring 2010.

The '''Heatherley School of Fine Art''' is an independent [[art school]] in London. 

The school was named after Thomas Heatherley who took over as the school's principal from [[James Mathews Leigh]] (when it was named "Leigh's").  Founded in 1845, the school is affectionately known as Heatherley's. It is one of the oldest independent art schools in London and is among the few art colleges in Britain that focus on portraiture, [[Figurative art|figurative painting]] and sculpture.

It opened a new school, on George Street (off [[Baker Street]]), London, in November 1927 after previously being located on Newman Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lord Dewar On Art |url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/bna/viewarticle?id=bl%2f0000483%2f19271104%2f135 |work=Kent &amp; Sussex Courier |date=4 November 1927 |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]] |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Russell Flint]], [[Solomon Joseph Solomon]], [[Gregoire Boonzaier]], [[Michael Ayrton]] and [[Kate Greenaway]] are numbered amongst its former students as was the first Principal of the [[Slade School of Art]], [[Edward Poynter|Sir Edward Poynter]].

The '''Houens fonds diplom''' (literally Houens Foundation Award) is  Norway's most important award for architecture. It was established in 1893 by the  [[Anton Christian Houen]] (1823–94). A successful  merchant and businessman, Houen  established several  philanthropic legacies and funds in the field of culture and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://nbl.snl.no/Anton_Christian_Houen|title=Anton Christian Houen, Forretningsdrivende, Legatstifter|publisher= Norsk biografisk leksikon |author=  Gustav Sætra|accessdate= September  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houens fonds diplom is awarded to buildings that are examples of "outstanding, independently completed works of architecture" in recognition of an architect's highest achievement. The award is made by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Culture]] on recommendations from the board of the [[Association of Norwegian Architects]] (''Norske arkitekters landsforbund'') in collaboration with the [[National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Houens_fonds_diplom|title=Houens fonds diplom|publisher=''Store Norske Leksikon''|accessdate=13 October 2016 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arkitektur.no/houens-fonds-diplom|title=Houens Fonds Diplom|publisher=Norske arkitekters landsforbund|accessdate=13 October 2016 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26894">The '''Hurufiyya movement''' ({{lang-ar|حروفية}} ''hurufiyya'', adjective form ''hurufi'' literal meaning "letters" [of the alphabet]) was an aesthetic movement that emerged in the late twentieth century amongst [[Arabian]] and North African artists, who used their understanding of traditional [[Islamic calligraphy]], within the precepts of [[modern art]]. By combining tradition and modernity, these artists worked towards developing a Pan-Arab visual language, which instilled a sense of national identity in their respective nation states, at a time when many of these states where shaking off colonial rule and asserting their independence. They adopted the same name as the [[Hurufi]], an approach of [[Sufism]] which emerged in the late 14th–early 15th century. Art historian, Dagher, has described hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in the Arab art world in the 20th-century. 

==Definition==
The term, ''hurifiyya'' is derived from the Arabic term, ''harf'' which means letter (as in a letter of the alphabet). When the term is used to describe an contemporary art movement, it explicitly references a Medieval system of teaching involving political theology and lettrism. In this theology, letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Mir-Kasimov, O., ''Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam,'' I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the term is charged with Sufi intellectual and esoteric meaning. &lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, pp 1294-95; Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The hurufiyya art movement (also known as the ''Al-hurufiyyah movement''&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Letrism movement''&lt;ref&gt;Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., ''Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,''New York, Merrill, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to the use of calligraphy as a graphic element within an artwork, typically an abstract work.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:] ;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The pan-Arab hurufiyya art movement is distinct from the [[Letterist International]] which had an Algerian section founded in [[Chlef]] in 1953 by [[Hadj Mohamed Dahou]]. 

The term, ''hurufiyya'' has become somewhat controversial and has been rejected by a number of scholars, including [[Wijdan Ali]], Nada Shabout and Karen  Dabrowska. An alternative term, ''al-Madrassa al-Khattiya Fil-Fann'' [Calligraphic School of Art] has been proposed to describe the experimental use of calligraphy in modern Arabic art.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80; Shabout, N., "Huroufiyah" in: ''Routledge Encyclopedia Of Modern Art,'' Routledge, 2016,  DOI: 10.4324/9781135000356-REM176-1; Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 166-67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history and philosophy==
[[File:Amir Khusraw Dihlavi - An Old Sufi Laments His Lost Youth - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''An Old Sufi Laments His Lost Youth,'' page from a Sufi manuscript, 13th century. Sufi art served as part of the inspiration for the al-hurufiyya movement.]]
Traditional hurufi art was bound by strict rules, which amongst other things, confined calligraphy to devotional works and prohibited the representation of humans in manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt; Schimmel,  A., ''Calligraphy and Islamic Culture,'' London, I.B. Taurus, 1990, pp 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Practising calligraphers trained with a master for many years in order to learn both the technique and the rules governing calligraphy. Contemporary hurufiyya artists broke free from these rules, allowing Arabic letters to be deconstructed, altered and included in abstract artworks.&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  

The use of traditional Arabic elements, notably, calligraphy, in modern art arose independently in various Islamic states; few of these artists working in this area, had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyya to develop in different regions. &lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, [https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006 DOI:]; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, for instance, the movement was known as the ''Old Khartoum School'',&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; and assumed a distinctive character in which both African motifs and calligraphy were combined, while media such as leather and wood replaced canvas to provide a distinct African style.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1298-1299; Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In Morocco, the movement was accompanied by the replacement of traditional media for oils; artists favoured traditional dyes such as henna, and embraced weaving, jewellery and tattoo as well as including traditional Berber motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, it was generally known as the ''al-hurufiyyah'' movement, while in Iran, the [[Iranian modern and contemporary art#Saqqakhaneh movement|Saqqa-Khaneh movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested that [[Madiha Omar]], who was active in the US and Baghdad from the mid-1940s, was the pioneer of the movement, since she was the first to explore the use of Arabic script in a contemporary art context in the 1940s and exhibited hurufiyya-inspired works in Washington in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  pp 115-119&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars have suggested that she was a ''precursor'' to Hurufiyya&lt;ref&gt;Anima Gallery, "Madiha Omar," [Biographical Notes], [https://www.meemartgallery.com/art_resources.php?id=89 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet other scholars have suggested that the hurufiyya art movement probably began in North Africa, in the area around Sudan, with the work of [[Ibrahim el-Salahi]],&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:];Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006&lt;/ref&gt; who initially explored Coptic manuscripts,  a step that led him to experiment with Arabic calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that by the early 1950s, a number of artists in different countries were experimenting with works based on calligraphy, including the Iraqi painter and sculptor, [[Jamil Hamoudi]] who experimented with the graphic possibilities of using Arabic characters, as early as 1947;&lt;ref&gt;Inati, S.C., ''Iraq: Its History, People, and Politics,'' Humanity Books, 2003, p.76; Beaugé, F. and Clément, J-F., ''L'image dans le Monde Arabé,''CNRS Éditions, 1995, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian painters, Nasser Assar (b. 1928) ([[:fr:Nasser Assar]]) and [[Hossein Zenderoudi]], who won a prize at the 1958 Paris Biennale.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Hurufiyya artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead grappled with a new artistic identity drawn from within their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions. &lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:]; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The common theme amongst hurufiyya artists is that they all tapped into the beauty and mysticism of Arabic calligraphy, but used it in a modern, abstract sense. &lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press, 2017, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Although hurufiyya artists struggled to find their own individual dialogue with nationalism, they also worked towards a broader aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented an affiliation with an Arab identity in the post-colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;

The art historian, Christiane Treichl, explains how calligraphy is used in contemporary art:&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; 
: "They deconstruct writing, exploit the letter and turn it into an indexical sign of calligraphy, tradition and cultural heritage. As the sign is purely aesthetic, and only linguistic in its cultural association, it opens hitherto untravelled avenues for interpretation, and attracts different audiences, yet still maintains a link to the respective artist's own culture... Hurufiyya artists do away with the signifying function of language. The characters become pure signs, and temporarily emptied of their referential meaning, they become available for new meanings."  

The hurufiyya art movement was not confined to painters, but also included important ceramicists such as the Jordanian, [[Mahmoud Taha]], who combined traditional aesthetics, including calligraphy, with skilled craftsmanship,&lt;ref&gt;Asfour, M., "A Window on Contemporary Arab Art," NABAD Art Gallery, Online: http://www.nabadartgallery.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and sculptors, such as the Qatari, [[Yousef Ahmad]]&lt;ref&gt;Anima Gallery, "Yousef Ahdmad," [Biographical Notes], [http://www.animagallery.com/artists/yousef-ahmad/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Iraqi sculptors, [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]]. Nor, was the movement organised along formal lines across the Arab-speaking nations. In some Arab nations, hurufiyya artists formed formal groups or societies, such as Iraq's ''Al Bu'd al Wahad'' (or the [[One Dimension Group]])" which published a manifesto,&lt;ref&gt;"Shaker Hassan Al Said," Darat al Funum, Online: www.daratalfunun.org/main/activit/curentl/anniv/exhib3.html; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; while in other nations artists working independently in the same city had no knowledge of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 165-66; Dadi, I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly. '' Vol. 109, No. 3, 2010, pp 555-576, DOI: 10.1215/00382876-2010-006&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art historian, Dagher, has described hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in the Arab world in the 20th-century. &lt;ref name="Dagher"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dagher|first1=Charles|last2=Mahmoud|first2=Samir|title=Arabic Hurufiyya: Art and Identity|date=2016|publisher=Skira Editore|location=Milan|isbn=978-8857231518}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' while acknowledging its importance in terms of encouraging Arab nationalism, describes hurufiyya as neither "a movement nor a school." &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of hurufiyya===
[[File:نصب أشعار بغداد.jpg|thumb|''[[Ashaar Baghdad (monument)|Ashaar Baghdad]]'' (Baghdad's poetry) by [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]]. In this fountain, Arabic words taken from a poem by Mustafa Jamal El Din have been squeezed together to form the oval shape in an example of Asbract calligraphy.]]

Art historians have identified three generations of hurufiyya artists: &lt;ref&gt;Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., ''Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,''New York, Merrill, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''First generation'': The pioneers, who inspired by the independence of their nations, searched for a new aesthetic language that would allow them to express their nationalism. These artists rejected European techniques and media, turning to indigenous media and introducing Arabic calligraphy into their art. For this group of artists, Arabic letters are a central feature of the artwork. First generation artists include: the Jordanian artist, [[Wijdan Ali|Princess Wijdan Ali]], the Sudanese artist, [[Ibrahim el-Salahi]]; the Iraqi artists, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said|Shakkir Hassan Al Sa'id]], [[Jamil Hamoudi]] and [[Jawad Saleem]]; the Lebanese painter and poet, [[Etel Adnan]] and the Egyptian artist, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926).  

: ''Second generation'': Artists, most of whom live in exile, but reference their traditions, culture and language in their artworks. The artist, [[Dia Azzawi]] is typical of this generation.

: ''Third generation'':  Contemporary artists who have absorbed international aesthetics, and who employ Arabic and Persian script occasionally. They deconstruct the letters, and use them in a purely abstract and decorative manner. The work of [[Golnaz Fathi]] and [[Lalla Essaydi]] is representative of the third generation.

==Types of hurufiyya art==
Hurufiyya art involved a very diverse range of "explorations into the abstract, graphic, and aesthetic properties of Arabic letters." &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians, including Wijdan Ali and Shirbil Daghir, have attempted to develop a way of classifying different types of hurufiyya art.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, pp 79-85&lt;/ref&gt; Ali identifies the following, which she describes as ''schools'' within the ''movement'': &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165; It should be noted that Daghir uses a different classification, not canvassed here.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Pure calligraphy
: Artworks in which calligraphy forms both the background and the foreground. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
; Neoclassical
: Works that adhere to the rules of 13th-century calligraphy. An example of this is the work of [[Khairat Al-Saleh]] (b. 1940) &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dia-Al-Azzawi-Portrait-Picture.jpg|thumb|Artist, Dia-Al-Azzawi, exhibits the style of the Calligraphy Combinations School of Hurufiyya art]]
; Modern classical
: Works that blend pure calligraphy with other motifs, such as repeating geometric patterns. Ahmad Moustaffa (b. 1943) is representative of this style&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165-66&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Calligraffiti]]  
: Artwork, employing script, but which follows no rules and where artists require no formal training. Calligraffiti artists employ their own ordinary handwriting within a modern composition. Artists may reshape letters, or simply invent new letters that reference traditional Arabic scripts. Artists that belong to this school include: Lebanese painter and poet, [[Etel Adnan]]; Egyptian painter, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926) and the Iraqi artist and intellectual. [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]].&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 167-69&lt;/ref&gt;
; Freeform calligraphy
: Artworks that balance classical styles with calligraffiti.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;
; Abstract calligraphy
: Art that deconstructs letters and includes them as a graphic element in an abstract artwork. In this style of art, letters may be legible, illegible or may use pseudo-script. Rafa al-Naisiri (b. 1940) and [[Mahmoud Hammad]] (1923-1988) are notable examples of this style of artist.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170-172&lt;/ref&gt;
; Calligraphy Combinations
: Artworks that use any combination of calligraphy styles, often employing marginal calligraphy or unconscious calligraphy. Artist, [[Dia Azzawi]] is a representative of this style.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraqi painter, [[Madiha Omar]], is recognised as a pioneer of the hurufiyaa art movement, having exhibited a number of hurufist-inspired works in Georgetown in Washington as early as 1949. &lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and publishing ''Arabic Calligraphy: An Inspiring Element in Abstract Art'' in 1950.&lt;ref name="Ahram"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexandria exhibition celebrates 'Hurufiyya' art movement - Visual Art - Arts &amp; Culture - Ahram Online|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/25/253331/Arts--Culture/Visual-Art/Alexandria-exhibition-celebrates-Hurufiyya-art-mov.aspx|website=english.ahram.org.eg|accessdate=18 February 2018|language=en}}; Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 117&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jamil Hamoudi]] was also a pioneer, active from the 1950s.

The '''interior portrait''' ('''portrait d'intérieur''') or, in German, '''Zimmerbild''' (room picture), is a pictorial genre that appeared in Europe near the end of the 17th century and enjoyed a great vogue in the second half of the 19th century. It involves a careful, detailed representation of a living space, without any people. These paintings were generally rendered as [[watercolor]]s and required great technical mastery, if little creativity. By the mid-20th century, although such scenes were still being created, photography had changed this style of painting into a form of intentional archaism.

==Birth of the genre==
The interior portrait should not be confused with what is called a "[[conversation piece]]" in England; a term which designates a scene with a group of people engaged in some activity and often placed outdoors. The true interior piece shows only the room and decor, although previous activity may be suggested by the placement of articles in the room.

This type of scene first appears near the end of the 17th century. At that time, the intent was entirely descriptive. They were usually done specifically to show the contents of an art gallery, personal library or [[cabinet of curiosities]]. One of the first known examples depicts the library of [[Samuel Pepys]] in London, dating from 1693. They are still valued today by researchers and decorators. In the case of Pepys, it can be seen, firsthand, how a scholar of that time arranges his books in a bookcase (an innovation at that time), uses a lectern, places cushions for his comfort, hangs maps, etc. 
[[File:Boxbarth after Feuillet Library interior c1700.jpg|thumb|left|Library project, c.1700. Engraving by Johann Boxbarth (fl.1690–1710)]]
It was not until the last quarter of the 18th century that a new type of interior portrait with a different intent made its appearance. This type first arose in architectural firms and was done for the benefit of their clients. Great architects such as the [[James Adam (architect)|James Adam]] and his brother [[Robert Adam]] of Scotland and [[François-Joseph Bélanger]] would execute watercolors of their previous projects to entice prospective customers. This created a fad among the wealthy and the nobility to commission paintings of their own rooms, to show off and preserve for posterity. These paintings were often compiled into albums. This craze was particularly prevalent in England. From there, it spread widely throughout Europe.

==Apogee in the 19th century==
[[File:Zimmerbild 83.jpg|thumb|The psychological dimensions of décor: interior portrait by Leopold Zielcke (1791–1861). Berlin, 1825]]

The first historically important example of the interior portrait represents a small art gallery set up by the [[Empress Josephine]] at [[Château de Malmaison|Malmaison]] in 1812. In this watercolor by [[Auguste-Siméon Garneray]], we can see her harp, art collection and her shawl, left on an armchair. Thus a new element appears: the psychological elements of the décor and a palpable human presence. One can feel the owner's emotions and thoughts. In this sense, the paintings have truly become "portraits".&lt;ref&gt;''An Illustrated History of Interior Decoration, From Pompeii to Art Nouveau'' by [[Mario Praz]], Thames &amp; Hudson, {{ISBN|0-500-23358-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Premazzi parlour.jpg|thumb|225px|The "petit salon rouge" at the [[Alexander Palace]] in [[Tsarskoye Selo]], by [[Luigi Premazzi]] (c.1855)]]

The immense popularity of these paintings in the 19th century can be explained by many factors. Among the [[nouveau-riche]] and the [[bourgeoisie]], great importance was given to the home as a place of comfort, intimacy and family. This period also saw a specialization (e.g. separate dining rooms) that were once known only to the very wealthy. These new "middle-classes" were also eager to copy aristocratic tastes and industrialization made a much wider variety of furniture easily affordable. Finally, decorative styles were constantly being changed and resurrected, so interior portraits were a way of preserving one's memories and bequeathing them to the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperhewitt.org/search/House%20Proud Exhibition Archive: ''House Proud'', Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Victoria]] was very fond of these portraits as they allowed her to give the public a look at her loving family life and the comforts of home in a tasteful manner.&lt;ref&gt;''La dernière reine : Victoria, 1819-1901'' by Philippe Alexandre and Béatrix de l'Aulnoit, Robert Laffont, Paris 2000, {{ISBN|2-221-09064-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The craze was thereby spread throughout the Royal Families of Europe. Due to the number of lavishly decorated palaces they possessed ([[The Winter Palace]],  [[Tsarskoye Selo]], [[Gatchina Palace]], [[Peterhof Palace]], [[Pavlovsk Palace]]...), the Tsars were among the most enthusiastic commissioners of interior portraits. Virtually all of their rooms (except the most private ones) were rendered at least once; some several times. These watercolors are considered to be among the best of their genre.&lt;ref&gt;in ''Vues des palais impériaux des environs de Saint-Petersbourg'', collected under the direction of Emmanuel Ducamp, edited by Alain de Gourcuff, Paris 1992, {{ISBN|2-909838-00-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speciality artists==

[[File:Zimmerbild 99.jpg|thumbnail|[[Ferdinand Rothbart]], Coburg 1848]]

At a time when every cultured young woman learned to paint watercolors, many painted their own rooms or the ones where they were given their lessons. Most of the surviving examples are anonymous and rarely of high quality, but they often have a charm that compensates for what they lack in technical expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Gere, ''L'époque et son style, la décoration intérieure au XIXe siècle'', Flammarion, Paris 1989, {{ISBN|978-2-08-010971-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Thornton]], ''Authentic Decor: The Domestic Interior 1620-1920'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1986, {{ISBN|0-297-83239-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some members of the aristocracy had real talent, verging on the professional. The Polish Count [[Artur Potocki]], for example, travelled widely, painting watercolors of the hotel rooms and other places where he stayed, from Rome to London.

Nevertheless, virtually all the highest-quality works were produced by professionals with exceptional virtuosity in watercolors and a mastery of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]...especially conical perspective, with two or three [[vanishing point]]s, which produces an eerily photographic effect for modern eyes.

With only a few exceptions, such as [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]] and [[Eugène Lami]] of France, architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and furniture-maker [[Thomas Sheraton]] (both of England), few artists who dealt exclusively with these portraits are still familiar today. Among some notable artists who produced them, not previously mentioned:

'''Josep Tapiró i Baró''' (17 February 1836, [[Reus]] - 4 October 1913, [[Tangier]]) was a Spanish painter; best known for his watercolor portraits from Morocco.

== Biography ==
His parents owned a hardware store. As with many future artists, he displayed an early affinity for drawing. His first formal studies were in 1849 with {{ill|Domènec Soberano|ca}}, a local wine merchant and amateur painter.&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[https://www.museodelprado.es/aprende/enciclopedia/voz/tapiro-y-baro-jose/267f41cc-f171-4e22-8b7f-10017c7b3ee8 Brief biography] @ the [[Museo del Prado]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, he and his fellow student, [[Marià Fortuny]], were given the opportunity to exhibit at a showing held by the Casino de Reus.

Later that year, he and Fortuny enrolled at the [[Escola de la Llotja]], where he studied with [[Claudi Lorenzale]], a painter associated with the German [[Nazarene movement]], among others.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; At this time, he produced mostly historical and religious scenes. 
[[File:Tapiro 186x Nens sota porxada part 1814 resize.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Children Under the Porch, from his time in Rome.]]
In 1857 he, Fortuny and two others were given the opportunity to compete for a grant to study in Rome. Fortuny was chosen and Tapiró moved to Madrid, where he enrolled at the "Escuela Superior de Pintura y Grabado", a branch of the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]. His instructor there was [[Federico de Madrazo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/t/tapiro.htm Biographical notes] @ Biografías y Vidas.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Barcelona in 1860 and assisted with decorating the façade at the [[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya]]

In 1862, he joined his friend, Fortuny, in Rome and was introduced to his circle of artistic acquaintances who met at the [[Antico Caffè Greco]]. They also visited Naples and Florence together. While there, he took evening classes to learn how to paint watercolors and his works began to focus more on [[Genre art|genre]] themes. These works became very popular and established his reputation.

In 1871 he, Fortuny and [[Bernardo Ferrándiz Bádenes|Bernardo Ferrándiz]] took a trip to Tangier.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; This would prove decisive for his career. In 1873, he held his first showing of [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] paintings at the "International Art Circle of Rome". Fortuny's sudden death in 1874 affected Tapiró deeply, and prompted his decision to leave Rome.
[[File:Tapiro 1913 retrat el Porvenir 1784 resize.jpg|thumb|160px|Photograph published in ''El Porvenir'', with his obituary.]]

===Living in Tangier===
Rather than remain in Spain, his memories of Tangier led him to join a diplomatic mission on its way to meet with Sultan [[Hassan I of Morocco|Hassan I]] in 1876. Once there, he moved into a newly-built home near the [[medina quarter]] and later acquired an old theater to serve as his studio.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; Although he frequently travelled to exhibitions (as far afield as Saint Petersburg and New York) and spent the summers with his family in Reus, he would live in Tangier for the rest of his life.

In 1886, he married twenty-year-old Maria Manuela Valerega Cano, a Tangier native of Italian ancestry. Shortly after, a Jewish friend of Maria's died and they adopted her orphaned son.

In 1905, his career declined. He began having respiratory and cardiovascular problems due to a lung infection he had contracted in 1903, and often did not have enough energy to work. Travelling to promote his paintings also became very difficult. The situation was aggravated by a sharp decrease in the number of foreign visitors and tourists; caused by the rebellion of [[Bou Hmara]] and the [[Perdicaris incident]]. In 1907, he and his wife rented a house in Madrid in a last ditch effort to promote his work at an exhibition of the [[Círculo de Bellas Artes]].

His health problems eventually led to his death. His executor began a collection to defray the costs of a monument in his honor, but it was never created. Initially, he was buried in Tangier but, in 1921, the government of Reus demanded that he be recognized in his home town. In 1947, his remains were moved to Reus and reinterred near his friend, Fortuny. A plaque was placed on the house where he was born. In 2013, a joint retrospective was held at the {{ill|Museu d'Art i Història de Reus|ca}} and the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museunacional.cat/ca/josep-tapiro-pintor-de-tanger "Josep Tapiró.

'''Las Pozas''' ("the Pools") is a surrealistic group of structures created by [[Edward James]], more than {{convert|2000|ft|m}} above sea level, in a subtropical rainforest in the mountains of [[Mexico]]. It includes more than {{convert|80|acre|ha}} of natural waterfalls and pools interlaced with towering surrealist sculptures in concrete.&lt;ref name="NYT-30Mar08"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2008/03/30/style/t/index.html#pageName=30laspozas "Dream Works: Can a Legendary Surrealist Garden in Mexico Bloom Again?"], ''New York Times Style Magazine'', 30 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Las Pozas is near the village of [[Xilitla, San Luis Potosí]], a seven-hour drive north of Mexico City. In the early 1940s, James went to [[Los Angeles, California]], and then decided that he "wanted a Garden of Eden set up . . . and I saw that Mexico was far more romantic" and had "far more room than there is in crowded Southern California".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Hooks, [http://www.edwardjameslaspozas.com "Surreal Eden: Edward James &amp; Las Pozas"], Princeton Architectural Press, New York, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-56898-612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hollywood in 1941, his lifetime friend and cousin, [[Magic Realism|Magic Realist]] painter [[Bridget Bate Tichenor]], encouraged him to search for a surreal location in Mexico to express his diverse esoteric interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://BridgetBateTichenor.com/ Bridget Bate Tichenor Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cuernavaca, Mexico|Cuernavaca]], he hired Plutarco Gastelum as a guide. They came to know Xilitla in November 1945.&lt;ref name="NYT-30Mar08"/&gt; Eventually, Plutarco got married and had four children. James was "Uncle Edward" to the children and frequently stayed with them in a house Plutarco had built, a mock-Gothic cement castle, now a hotel – La Posada El Castillo.&lt;ref name="L&amp;T"/&gt;

Between 1949 and 1984, James built scores of surreal concrete structures which carry the names ''The House on Three Floors Which Will in Fact Have Five or Four or Six'', ''The House with a Roof like a Whale'', and ''The Staircase to Heaven''.&lt;ref name="L&amp;T"&gt;Gini Alhadeff, [http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/concrete-jungle "Concrete Jungle"], ''Travel + Leisure", September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; There were also plantings and beds full of tropical plants, including orchids — there were, apparently, 29,000 at Las Pozas at one time&lt;ref name="TG-6Nov07"&gt;Joanna Moorhead, [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/architecture/story/0,,2206530,00.html "The Magic Kingdom (James' Las Pozas, Mexico)"], ''The Guardian'', 6 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; — and a variety of small homes, niches, and pens that held exotic birds and wild animals from the world over—James owned many exotic animals and once even took his pet boa constrictors to the Hotel Francis in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="L&amp;T"/&gt;

Massive sculptures up to four stories tall punctuate the site. The many trails throughout the garden site are composed of steps, ramps, bridges and narrow, winding walkways that traverse the valley walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stepsandfalls.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=28 "Los Pozas – steps and falls"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416080547/http://www.stepsandfalls.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=28 |date=2008-04-16 }}, virtual tour of the grounds of Las Pozas, DVD, published 2007; retrieved 30 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of Las Pozas cost more than $5 million. To pay for it, James sold his collection of surrealistic art at an auction.&lt;ref name="L&amp;T"/&gt;

In the summer of 2007, the Fundación Pedro y Elena Hernández, the company [[Cemex]], and the government of [[San Luis Potosí]] paid about $2.2 million for Las Pozas and created [http://www.xilitla.org Fondo Xilitla], a foundation that oversees the preservation and restoration of the site.&lt;ref name="NYT-30Mar08"/&gt;

[[File:PorruaBookstoreRepArgJusSierra.JPG|thumb|Original store in the historic center of Mexico City]]
'''Librería Porrúa Hermanos y Compañía''' [[S.A. de C.V.]] is a [[bookseller]] and [[publishing company]] in [[Mexico]], and is one of the longest-established businesses operating in the Mexican [[book trade (disambiguation)|book trade]]. The Porrúa name has been associated with books and publishing since the beginning of the 20th century, through its flagship '''Librería Porrúa''' bookstore in [[Mexico City]] and subsidiary stores throughout the country, and the company's renowned and extensive publishing business operating under the names and [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s of '''Librería Porrúa Hermanos''' and '''Editorial Porrúa'''.

==History==
Hermanos Porrúa has over 100 years of history as bookseller and publisher in Mexico. In the second half of the 19th century, three brothers emigrated from [[Spain]] to Mexico City: José, Indalecio and Francisco Porrúa. Indalecio had a market stall on what is now Del Carmen Street, north northwest of the [[Zócalo]], in which he had a sign stating that he bought and sold libraries. His business was successful enough that he asked his brothers to join him. The libraries that they purchased were important not only for the works that they contained but also because from whom they were purchased, including some of the Mexico City’s nobility. They published Mexico’s first bibliography called the “Boletín Bibliográfico” which categorized the antique books for sale. It and others like it would set the value of most of the antique books in Mexico over the following century.&lt;ref name="conocenos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.porrua.com/tienda_conocenos.asp |title=Librería Hermanos Porrúa |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901210345/http://www.porrua.com/tienda_conocenos.asp |archivedate=2009-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing==
Porrúa began publishing in 1910, starting with a “Guide to the City of Mexico” by José Romero, physically printed in Spain but distributed in Mexico by Porrúa. Four years later, the first book completely published in Mexico, a collection of poems, was offered by the company. The company’s logo, called the “Caballero Aguila” (Eagle Knight) was devised in 1915 by Saturnino Herrán. During the 1930s (at least), the business published as "Porrúa Hermanos y compania".&lt;ref name="WorldCat"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=kw%3APorr%C3%BAa+Hermanos+y+compania&amp;qt=results_page|title=Librería Hermanos Porrúa |accessdate=2013-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern organization of the business took shape in 1940, changing its name to Editorial Porrúa and the company began printing specialty books, such as those on law and art. In 1959, Porrúa began printing a series of classical works with the aim of making these more affordable to the general public. Starting in 1964, Porrúa began publishing its own reference work called “El Diccionario de Historia Biografía y Geografía de México” (Dictionary of the History, Biographies and Geography of Mexico) and in 1992 began a division dedicated to young readers, starting with a version of the story of [[Don Quixote]].&lt;ref name="conocenos"/&gt;

==Bookstore==
The original site of Librería Hermanos Porrúa is at the corner of República de Argentina and Justo Sierra Street in the historic center of [[Mexico City]]. The building was originally a house that dates from the 18th century and has two floors. The outside of the building maintains much of original décor, such as the geometric design on both floors, a niche with a statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] and iron railings on the windows of the upper floor. The inside of the building has been completely modernized and the lower floor is dedicated to the bookstore.&lt;ref name="Horz"&gt;{{cite book |title= Guia Oficial Centro de la Ciudad de México  |last=Horz de Via (ed)  |first=Elena  |year=1991  |publisher= INAH-SALVAT |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-32-0540-2  |page=52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the original store in the Centro Histórico, Porrúa now has stores in all of the states of México and is also present in many location of the department store El Palacio de Hierro and the office supply chain Office Max in México.&lt;ref name="conocenos"/&gt;

The '''Museumplein''' ({{IPA-nl|myˌzeːjʏmˈplɛin}}; {{Lang-en|Museum Square}}) is a [[public space]] in the [[Museumkwartier (Amsterdam)|Museumkwartier]] neighbourhood of the [[Amsterdam-Zuid]] [[stadsdeel|borough]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. Located at the Museumplein are three major museums – the [[Rijksmuseum]], [[Van Gogh Museum]], and [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam|Stedelijk Museum]] – and the concert hall [[Concertgebouw]].&lt;ref name="mdist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum District|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/visiting/areas/amsterdam-neighbourhoods/centre/museum-quarter|website=iamsterdam.com|publisher=Amsterdam Marketing|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was originally a wax candle factory and marshy meadows. Construction began following the completion of the Rijksmuseum in 1885, with a street plan based on the design of [[Pierre Cuypers]], the museum’s celebrated architect.&lt;ref name="mdist"/&gt; The area was the location of the [[Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling|International Colonial and Export Exhibition]] in 1883.

The Museumplein was reconstructed after a design by the [[Sweden|Swedish]]/[[Denmark|Danish]] [[Landscape architecture|landscape architect]] [[Sven-Ingvar Andersson]] in 1999. It now includes underground parking spaces and an underground supermarket. In the winter, the pond can be transformed into an artificial [[ice skating]] area.

The space is also used for (mass) events such as [[festival]]s, [[Party|celebration]]s, and [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s and  [[Armin Van Buuren]] honoured [[Netherlands national football team|The Dutch Team]] at Museumplein in 2010 by playing [[Swedish House Mafia]]. 

In July 2017 the [[2017 FIBA 3x3 Europe Cup]], the European [[3x3 basketball]] tournament, was held at the Museumplein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiba.basketball/nl/3x3europecup/2017/bereikbaarheid]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main "I amsterdam" sign is also located here in front of the Rijksmuseum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/rebranding-amsterdam-and-what-it-means-to-rebrand-a-city-19539392/|title=Rebranding Amsterdam and What It Means to Rebrand a City|last=Stamp|first=Jimmy|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The sculpture "Self Portrait of a Dreamer" by Joseph Klibansky is exhibited within the pond from 26 June 2018 to 28 Aug 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://josephklibansky.com/news/13-meter-tall-self-portrait-of-a-dreamer-sculpture-on-museum-square-amsterdam|title=News: 13 meter tall “Self Portrait of a Dreamer” sculpture on Museum Square Amsterdam|website=Joseph Klibansky|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neo-conceptual art''' describes art practices in the 1980s and particularly 1990s to date that derive from the [[conceptual art]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  These subsequent initiatives have included the [[Moscow Conceptualists]], United States neo-conceptualists such as [[Sherrie Levine]] and the [[Young British Artists]], notably [[Damien Hirst]] and [[Tracey Emin]] in the [[United Kingdom]], where there is also a [[Stuckism]] counter-movement and criticism from the 1970s conceptual art group [[Art and Language]].

Many of the concerns of the "conceptual art" movement proper have been taken up by many contemporary artists since the initial wave of conceptual artists. While many of these artists may not term themselves "conceptual artists", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, [[digital art]], and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[computer art]], [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art]]. Many critics and artists may speak of conceptual aspects of a given artist or art work, reflecting the enduring influence that many of the original conceptual artists have had on the art world.

==New York City==
The idea of neo-conceptual art (sometimes later termed [[post-conceptual art]]) in the United States was clearly articulated by [[Tricia Collins]] and [[Richard Milazzo]] (working as a team called: Collins &amp; Milazzo) in the early 1980s in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/arts/art-now-on-view-new-work-by-freelance-curators.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm ART; Now on View, New Work by Freelance Curators]&lt;/ref&gt; when they brought to prominence a whole new generation of artists through their copious writings and curatorial activity. It was their exhibitions and writings that originally fashioned the theoretical context for a new kind of neo (or post) conceptual art; one that argued simultaneously against [[Neo-Expressionism]] and Picture-Theory Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DAN+CAMERON+ON+Collins+%26+Milazzo.-a057475774] DAN CAMERON ON Collins &amp; Milazzo&lt;/ref&gt; It was through this context that the work of many of the artists associated with Neo-Conceptualism (or what some of the critics reductively called “Simulationism” and “Neo Geo”) was first brought together: artists such as [[Ross Bleckner]], [[James Welling]], [[Steven Parrino]], [[Richard Prince]], [[Peter Nagy (artist)|Peter Nagy]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Mark Innerst]], [[Allan McCollum]], [[Peter Halley]], [[Jonathan Lasker]], [[Haim Steinbach]], [[Philip Taaffe]], [[Robert Gober]] and [[Saint Clair Cemin]].

==Moscow==
The [[Moscow Conceptualists]], in the 1970s and 80s, attempted to subvert socialist ideology using the strategies of [[conceptual art]] and [[appropriation art]]. The central figures were [[Ilya Kabakov]] and [[Komar and Melamid]]. The group also included [[Eric Bulatov]] and [[Viktor Pivovarov]].

==London==
The [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs), led by [[Damien Hirst]], came to prominence in the 1990s and their work was described at the time as neo-conceptual,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Lash and Celia Lury, ''Global Culture Industries: The Mediation of Things'', Polity, 2007, p211. {{ISBN|0-7456-2483-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it relies very heavily on the art object to make its impact. The term is used in relation to them on the basis that the object is not the artwork, or is often a [[Found art|found object]], which has not needed artistic skill in its production. [[Tracey Emin]] is seen as a leading YBA and a neo-conceptualist, even though she has denied that she is and has emphasised personal emotional expression. Charles Harrison, a member of the conceptual art group [[Art and Language]] in the 1970s, criticizes the neo-conceptual art of the 1990s as conceptual art "without threat or awkwardness"&lt;ref&gt;Charles Harrison, ''Essays on Art &amp; Language'', MIT Press, 2001, p29. {{ISBN|0-262-58241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "vacant" prospect.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Harrison, ''Essays on Art &amp; Language'', MIT Press, 2001, p241. {{ISBN|0-262-58241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable artists associated with neo-conceptualism in the UK include [[Martin Creed]], [[Liam Gillick]], [[Bethan Huws]], [[Simon Patterson (artist)|Simon Patterson]], [[Simon Starling]] and [[Douglas Gordon]].

==Notable events==
1991: [[Charles Saatchi]] funds Damien Hirst and the next year in the [[Saatchi Gallery]] exhibits his ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine.

1993: [[Vanessa Beecroft]] holds her first performance in Milan, Italy, using models to act as a second audience to the display of her diary of food.

1999: [[Tracey Emin]] is nominated for the [[Turner Prize]]. Part of her exhibit is ''My Bed'', her dishevelled bed, surrounded by detritus such as condoms, blood-stained knickers, bottles and her bedroom slippers.

2001: [[Martin Creed]] wins the Turner Prize for ''The Lights Going On and Off'', an empty room where the lights go on and off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1698032.stm BBC Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

2005: [[Simon Starling]] wins the Turner Prize for ''Shedboatshed'', a wooden shed which he had turned into a boat, floated down the Rhine and turned back into a shed again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1905555,00.html ''The Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy in the UK==
In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the rise to prominence of the [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs) after the 1988 ''[[Freeze (exhibition)|Freeze]]'' show, curated by Damien Hirst, and subsequent promotion of the group by the [[Saatchi Gallery]] during the 1990s, generated a media backlash, where the phrases "conceptual art" and "neo-conceptual" came to be terms of derision applied to much [[contemporary art]]. This was amplified  by the [[Turner Prize]] whose more extreme nominees (most notably Hirst and Emin) caused a controversy annually.

[[File:Stuckists Death of Conceptual Art demo (3).jpg|thumb|right|170 px|[[Stuckism|Stuckists']] "Death of Conceptual Art" coffin demonstration, 2002]]
The [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] group of artists, founded in 1999, proclaimed themselves "pro-contemporary figurative painting with ideas and anti-conceptual art, mainly because of its lack of concepts." They also called it pretentious, "unremarkable and boring" and on July 25, 2002 deposited a coffin outside the [[White Cube]] gallery, marked "The Death of Conceptual Art".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Tate/WhiteCube.html "White Cube Demo 2002"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 19 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cripps, Charlotte. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040907/ai_n12797891 "Visual arts: Saying knickers to Sir Nicholas], ''[[The Independent]]'', 7 September 2004. Retrieved from findarticles.com, 7 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They staged yearly demonstrations outside the Turner Prize.

In 2002, [[Ivan Massow]], the Chairman of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] branded conceptual art "pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat" and in "danger of disappearing up its own arse ... led by cultural tsars such as the [[Tate Gallery|Tate]]'s Sir [[Nicholas Serota]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,634797,00.html ''The Guardian'']&lt;/ref&gt; Massow was consequently forced to resign. At the end of the year, the Culture Minister, [[Kim Howells]] (an art school graduate) denounced the Turner Prize as "cold, mechanical, conceptual bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/11/01/nart01.xml ''The Daily Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004 the [[Saatchi Gallery]] told the media that "painting continues to be the most relevant and vital way that artists choose to communicate."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Nigel 2004 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/02/nsaat02.xml "Saatchi's latest shock for the art world is &amp;ndash; painting"] ''The Daily Telegraph'' 10 February 2004. Accessed  April 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Following this [[Charles Saatchi]] began to sell prominent works from his YBA collection.

==History==
In 2008, Stefan Siegel and his brother Daniel founded NJAL as a networking platform for fashion designers.&lt;ref name = wonderlandmagazine/&gt;&lt;ref name = whatdesigncando&gt;{{cite web | url = http://issuu.com/whatdesigncando/docs/wdcd12_book_web_issuu| title = The Connecting Forces of Design | publisher = WDCD | year = 2012 | accessdate = 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NJAL launched "The Shop" section of their website in 2009, making it the first e-commerce site to allow consumers to buy directly from designers.&lt;ref name = monocle/&gt; ''Grazia Daily'' reported that items in "The Shop" were curated by celebrities including [[Amanda Lepore]] and [[Lara Stone]].&lt;ref name = graziadaily/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a2636/london-fashion-news-lara-stone-matches-2110/| title = London Fashion News: Lara Stone and Matches | publisher = Elle | date = 25 August 2009 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Spring/Summer 2010 season, NJAL released a limited edition offering of organic cotton T-shirts and tank tops featuring signature designs and prints of designers.&lt;ref name = thenextweb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thediscerningbrute.com/tag/not-just-a-label/| title = Not Just a Label: Exclusive Organic Collection | publisher = The Doscerning Brute | date = 17 June 2010 |accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, NJAL collaborated with Spanish label [[Mango (clothing)|Mango]] in a competition where young designers presented collections at the 'El Botón' Mango Fashion Awards with NJAL supervising competitors. The same year, the site won the [[Drapers]] Etail Award for Best E-Commerce innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Curated By NJAL | publisher = Highs Nobiety | author = Reeve, Georgia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NJAL first collaborated with the [[British Council]] in 2011 for the "London Meets Beirut" seminar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mycake.org/london-meets-beirut-innovation-in-the-design-industry/  | title = London meets Beirut: Innovation in the design industry | publisher = My Cake | date = 30 November 2011 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Davies, Lauren }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, NJAL received a grant from the British Council to travel to India during Lakmé Fashion Week in order to develop business relationships in the country.&lt;ref name = thenextweb/&gt;&lt;ref name = creativeeconomy&gt;{{cite web | url = http://creativeconomy.britishcouncil.org/people/stefan-siegel/ | title = Stefan Siegel | publisher = British Council| accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, NJAL participated in a three-week tour of Eastern European fashion weeks where the company delivered workshops and scouted talent in [[Bratislava]], [[Kiev]], [[Łódź]], [[Belgrade]] and [[Riga]]. The trips were documented through a partnership with [[Vogue Italia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vogue.it/en/talents/news/2012/10/eastern-europe-diary-1  | title = Eastern Europe Diary 1 | publisher = Vogue Italia | date = 18 October 2012 | accessdate = 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vogue.it/en/talents/news/2012/11/eastern-europe-diary-2  | title = Eastern Europe Diary 2 | publisher = Vogue Italia | date = 2 November 2012 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, online-trend analysis and research service [[WGSN]] offered NJAL designers services at a 98 percent discount in order to support young talent while expanding the WGSN professional network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fashionotes.com/content/2012/05/not-just-a-label-partners-with-wgsn/ | title = Not Just A Label Partners With WGSN | publisher = Fashionotes | date = 24 May 2012 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Bailie, Lauren }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://insidefmm.com/2012/05/not-just-a-label-offers-nearly-free-trend-service-this-month/ | title = Not Just A Label Offers Nearly-Free Trend Service This Month | publisher = Inside FMM | date = May 2012 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NJAL began The Open Source Partnership with [[Vivienne Westwood]] in 2013. NJAL advised the fashion house on expanding their e-commerce business and creating a new open-source website for Westwood. In turn, Westwood became a major investor in the platform.&lt;ref name = dasmagazin&gt;{{cite news | title = Sechs Jahre Im Leben | publisher = Das Magazin | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Alt(r)a Moda | publisher = Ci | author = Damaggio, Marika }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Wir tauschen die Marke durch die Story aus | publisher = Form Magazin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NJAL collaborated with the Who's Next fashion trade show in 2013 to create "The Future of Fashion" program where twenty emerging designers competed for the chance to show their designs during the Who's Next Autumn/Winter [[Paris]] trade show. Selected designers showed their collections at the 2014 Who's Next show with Siegel as one of the judges of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fashionunited.co.uk/fashion-news/design/whos-next-and-not-just-a-label-launch-new-program-2013112819240 | title = Who's Next and Not Just A Label launch new program | publisher = Fashion United | date = 28 November 2013 |accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, NJAL partnered with Matteo Marzotto and the Fiera di Vicenza center to hold the company's first offline event called "Origin Passion &amp; Beliefs." 100 NJAL designers participated in order to showcase their wares and network with others in the fashion industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessoffashion.com/2014/05/matteo-marzotto-joins-just-label-unite-fashion-jewellery.html | title = Matteo Marzotto Joins with Not Just a Label to Unite Fashion and Jewellery | publisher = The Business of Fashion | date = 21 May 2014 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Kansara, Vikram Alexei }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/3def5f6e-8f3b-11e3-be85-00144feab7de.html#axzz3QhKbPm5a | title = Matteo Marzotto reveals his plans to revitalise his country’s gold industry | publisher = Financial Times | date = 26 March 2014 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Sanderson, Rachel }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.notjustalabel.com/sites/default/files/pressfiles/167585/vogue_italia_on_origin_notjustalabel_1389358678.pdf  | title = Origin Passion &amp; Beliefs | publisher = Vogue Italia | date = 21 April 2014 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, NJAL was the only international platform to attend Ukrainian Fashion Week during the [[2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|political turbulence]] occurring at the time.&lt;ref name = mbkiev&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mbkievfashiondays.com/en/news/v-kiev-edet-progressivnyiy-london-v-litse-osnovatelya-not-just-a-lable/| title = The Founder of Not Just a Label Will Give A Public Talk In Kiev | publisher = Mercedes-Benz Kiev Fashion Days |accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uacrisis.org/ukrainian-fashion-week-stands-against-war/| title = Ukrainian Fashion Week Stands Against War | publisher = Ukraine Crisis Media Center | date = 22 March 2014 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2014/03/20/couturiers-undeterred-by-crisis-at-ukraine-fashion-week/| title = Couturiers Undeterred by Crisis at Ukraine Fashion Week | publisher = The Wall Street Journal | date = 20 March 2014 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Mesco, Manuela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NJAL curated and managed the launch of the [[AEG]] produced documentary "The Next Black" about the future of textiles. The film was released in conjunction with the release of new high efficiency [[washing machines]].&lt;ref name = ellebelgium&gt;{{cite news | title = 10 choses quivont revolutionner la mode | publisher = Elle | date = September 2014 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2014 Copenhagen Fashion Summit, NJAL presented plans for the "Re-start Fashion" initiative, developed to help designers solve ecological challenges in the fashion industry through sustainable design.&lt;ref name = ecofashionworld&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ecofashionworld.com/Events/Copenhagen-Fashion-Summit-The-Anatomy-of-Sustainable-Fashion.html | title = Copenhagen Fashion Summit: The Anatomy of Sustainable Fashion | publisher = Eco Fashion World | date = 8 May 2014 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Locskai, Nora }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = copenhagen&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.copenhagenfashionsummit.com/video | title = Restart Fashion - 5 Easy steps by Connie Nielsen, Stefan Siegel and Jonas Eder-Hansen | publisher = Copenhagen Fashion Summit | accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NJAL relaunched its site in 2014 in order to make it more user-compatible on smart phones and tablets as well as desktops.&lt;ref name = femalefirst&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/lifestyle-fashion/stylenews/not-just-a-label-hand-picked-luxury-fashion-511519.html| title = Not Just A Label launches website for hand-picked luxury fashion | publisher = Female First | date = 31 July 2014 |accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Davies, Taryn }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the e-commerce part of the site was established in 2009, the 2014 relaunch made sales the main component of the site.&lt;ref name = stylebubble&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stylebubble.co.uk/style_bubble/2014/08/a-new-njal.html| title = A New NJAL | publisher = Style Bubble | date = 1 August 2014 |accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relaunch also incorporated an open source [[content management system]] into the site which allows designers to edit their own profiles.&lt;ref name = femalefirst/&gt;

===Notable designers and celebrity clients===
Notable designers who showcased early on with NJAL include [[Mary Katrantzou]], [[Damir Doma]] and [[Rad Hourani]].&lt;ref name = nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name = dasmagazin/&gt;&lt;ref name = mbkiev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://howtospendit.ft.com/style/4222-where-to-spot-fashions-next-big-thing| title = Where to spot fashion's next big thing | publisher = How To Spend It | date = 5 April 2011 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Macpherson, Lindsay }}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrities who have purchased items from designers showcased on NJAL include [[Rihanna]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Alice Dellal]], [[Pixie Geldof]], [[Paris Hilton]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Katie Holmes]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]], [[Elle Mcpherson]] and [[Beyoncé]].&lt;ref name = graziadaily/&gt;&lt;ref name = whatdesigncando/&gt;&lt;ref name = insidefmm&gt;{{cite web | url = http://insidefmm.com/2010/09/not-just-a-label-supporting-avant-garde-fashion-designers/| title = Not Just A Label: Supporting Avant-garde Fashion Designers | publisher = Inside FMM |accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==

'''OperaWorks''' is an opera training program, founded by program director Ann Baltz, and conducted in [[Northridge, Los Angeles|Northridge, California]], USA.

==Description==
[[File:Singularity.jpg|thumb|left|Performance scene from the 2009 documentary [[SING*ularity]] about OperaWorks, directed by [[Brad Mays]], produced by [[Lorenda Starfeld]]]]

OperaWorks is a training program for singers and instructors working in the field of [[classical music]]. Accepting a limited number of students selected each year from up to eight cities across the United States, the program operates from the beginning of June and runs through the end of July, annually. OperaWorks was founded in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operaworks.com/index.php?q=about|title=OperaWorks – About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by classical pianist Ann Baltz as a response to what she saw as the myopic tendencies of conventional operatic training. Baltz envisioned a new approach to the training of vocalists, in which the "total instrument" would be addressed, not just the voice itself. Over the years, her program has expanded to include instruction in [[Motion (physics)|movement]], [[Yoga]], [[acting]], [[Creative visualization|visualization]], [[conducting]], [[improvisation]] and the [[Alexander technique]], as well as [[career management]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://operaworks.org/media|title=Media|website=OperaWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anderson.edu/academics/music/classical-improv/&lt;/ref&gt;

Borrowing to some degree from teaching techniques long utilized in contemporary theatrical training, OperaWorks strives to free the individual vocal artist in such a manner that the physical conventions and artifice of [[opera]] performance can fall away, hopefully revealing something altogether truer to life itself. Recognizing the uniqueness of each individual artist, OperaWorks endeavors to develop singers from the inside out, thus enabling them to trust their own instincts – musically, emotionally, dramatically.

In 2006, Baltz invited [[independent film|independent]] [[auteur|filmmaker]] [[Brad Mays]] to spend an entire summer filming the various classes and events at OperaWorks. The results are to be seen in the documentary feature film ''[[SING*ularity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0831324|Sing*ularity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perpetual Art Machine''' ('''PAM''') was founded in [[New York City]] in January 2006 by artists Chris Borkowski, Aaron M. Miller, Raphaele Shirley and [[Lee Wells]] in collaboration with Alexis Hubshman, president of the [[Scope art fair]]. Through the use of [[open source]] [[content management system|CMS]] and [[digital asset management|DAM]] software such as [[Joomla]] and [[Gallery2]], streaming video [[technologies]] and custom [[software]] developed in Max/MSP and Jitter, as well as [[MySQL]], PAM has become a [[video art]] portal on the internet. Since its first installation in at the Scope New York art fair in March 2006 PAM has grown via its web site into a free community of more than 900 artists from over 50 countries and consists of over 1000 video art works on-line and in its [[interactive]] [[video installation]]. PAM has featured a number of notable video artists, including [[Lev Manovich]], [[Janet Biggs]], and [[John Criscitello]].

'''RAL''' is a [[color|colour]] matching system used in [[Europe]] that is created and administrated by the German RAL gGmbH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Imprint|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/footer-navigation/weitere-seiten/imprint.html|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (RAL non-profit LLC), which is a subsidiary of the German RAL Institute. In colloquial speech RAL refers to the RAL Classic system, mainly used for [[varnish]] and [[powder coating]] but nowadays there are reference panels for plastics as well. 
Approved RAL products are provided with a hologram as of early 2013 to make unauthorised versions difficult to produce. Imitations may show different hue and colour when observed under various light sources.

==RAL colour space system==
[[File:RAL K5 Fächer RGB.jpg|thumb|RAL CLASSIC K5 colour fan]]
{{see also|List of RAL colors}}

===RAL Classic===
In 1927 the German ''Reichs-Ausschuß für Lieferbedingungen und Gütesicherung'' (Imperial Commission for Delivery Terms and Quality Assurance) invented a collection of forty colours under the name of "RAL 840".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAL Colours history|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/about-ral-colours/ral-colours-history.html|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to that date manufacturers and customers had to exchange samples to describe a tint, whereas from then on they would rely on numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAL Historie|url=https://www.ral-logolizenz.com/fileadmin/lib/pdf/RAL_Historie.pdf|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s the numbers were changed uniformly to four digits and the collection was renamed to "RAL 840 R" (R for revised). With tints constantly added to the collection, it was revised again in 1961 and changed to "RAL 840-HR", which consists of 210 colours and is in use to this day. In the 1960s the colours were given supplemental names to avoid confusion in case of transposed digits.

As "RAL 840-HR" covered only matte paint the 1980s saw the invention of "RAL 841-GL" for glossy surfaces, limited to 193 colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The RAL CLASSIC Colour Collection|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/en/PRODUCTS-SHOP/RAL-CLASSIC/|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main criterion for colours in the RAL Classic collection is to be of "paramount interest". Therefore, most of the colours in it are used on warning and [[traffic sign]]s or are dedicated to government agencies and public services (for example: RAL 1004 - Swiss [[Postal Service]], RAL 1021 - Austrian Postal Service, RAL 1032 - German Postal Service).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How is the RAL CLASSIC colour collection structured?|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/application-help/faqs/faqs-questions-about-ral-classic.html |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first digit relates to the shade of the colour:

===RAL F9===
This collection, which follows the naming of RAL Classic, was invented in 1961. It is nowadays made up of ten colours (RAL 1039-F9 Sand beige, RAL 1040-F9 Clay beige, RAL 6031-F9 Bronze green, RAL 6040-F9-Light olive, RAL 7050-F9 Camouflage grey, RAL 8027-F9 Leather brown, RAL 8031-F9 Sand brown, RAL 9021-F9 Tar black and RAL 6031-HR Bronze green for non-camouflage applications), used by the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' for [[military camouflage]] coating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAL F9|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/en/PRODUCTS-SHOP/RAL-CLASSIC/RAL-F9.html|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does RAL CLASSIC include the camouflage colours of Germany's Armed Forces?|url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/application-help/faqs/faqs-questions-about-ral-classic.html|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RAL Design===
In 1993 a new colour matching system was introduced, tailored to the needs of [[architect]]s, [[designer]]s and [[advertising|advertisers]]. It started with 1,688 colours and was revised to 1,625 colours. The colours of RAL Classic and RAL Design do not intersect.

Contrary to the preceding systems, RAL Design features no names and its numbering follows a scheme based on the CIELAB colour space, specifically [[Lab color space#Cylindrical representation: CIELCh or CIEHLC|cylindrical CIEHLC]]. Each colour is represented by seven digits, grouped in a triple and two pairs, representing [[hue]] (000–360 degrees, angle in the CIELab colour wheel), [[lightness]] (same as in ''L''*''a''*''b''*) and [[Colourfulness|chroma]] (relative saturation). The three numeric components of almost all RAL Design colours are multiples of 5, most are even divisible by 10.&lt;ref name="Design"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ral-farben.de/content/application-help/all-ral-colours-names/overview-ral-design-colours.html | title=Overview of all RAL Design colours }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Conversion from RAL Design number tuple to CIELAB
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\text{RAL}_\text{Design} &amp;= \left(h_{ab}^{\circ}, L^{*}, C_{ab}^{*}\right)\\
a^{*} &amp;= C_{ab}^{*}\cdot\cos\left(h_{ab}^{\circ}\right)\\
 b^{*} &amp;= C_{ab}^{*}\cdot\sin\left(h_{ab}^{\circ}\right)\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

: "RAL 210 50 15" converts to ''L''* = 50, ''a''* = −12.99, ''b''* = −7.5, for instance.

===RAL Effect===
RAL Effect comprises 420 solid colours and, as a particular highlight, seventy metallic colours. It is the first collection from RAL to be based on waterborne paint systems. No use is made of [[heavy metals]] such as lead, cadmium and chromates.

The newly developed, multifunctional double colour fan RAL E 2 underlines the character of RAL Effect. RAL Effect allows eco-efficient colour production for all paint and lacquer producers.

===RAL Digital===
The [[software]] for architects, interior decorators and all those who deal with colours in a creative way. RAL Digital integrates the colours of RAL Classic, RAL Effect and RAL Design into graphics and CAD programs.

=== RAL Colour Feeling ===
"Colour Feeling 09/10" is primarily designed as a professional planning tool for designers, architects, interior designers, interior decorators and painters. It is meant to be a source of inspiration on how to creatively combine the main trend colours for the coming two years. But also general consumers can be inspired by the work book to develop their own ideas and to create their personal colour design.

'''Rosa Menkman''' (born 1983) is a Dutch art [[theorist]], [[curator]], and visual artist specialising in [[glitch art]] and [[Image resolution|resolution]] theory. She investigates video compression, feedback, and glitches, using her exploration to generate art works.

Menkman's ''The Collapse of PAL'' (2011), in which she acknowledges the end of [[PAL]] (Phase Alternating Line)—an analogue video programming structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/artist/rosa-menkman|title=Rosa Menkman - 2 Artworks, Bio &amp; Shows on Artsy|website=www.artsy.net|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;—is the digital version of a live audio visual performance first performed on national Danish television and afterward realized at oa. Transmediale (Germany) and Nova festival (Brasil).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/artwork/rosa-menkman-the-collapse-of-pal|title=Rosa Menkman {{!}} The Collapse of PAL (2011) {{!}} Artsy|website=www.artsy.net|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menkman has curated several international exhibitions of other artists' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.furtherfield.org/programmes/exhibition/glitch-momentums | title=Glitch Moment/ums, Furtherfield, 8 June - 28 July 2013 | year=2013 | accessdate=1 June 2014 | author=Menkman, Rosa and Furtherfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Glitch art ==

In 2011, Menkman published ''Network Notebook #04: The Glitch Moment(um)''. This book uses information theory to propose an understanding of "[[glitch art]]" as a particular genre of [[contemporary art]]. She argues that the glitch shifts between being an artifact and a process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://networkcultures.org/blog/publication/no-04-the-glitch-momentum-rosa-menkman/|title=Institute of Network Cultures {{!}} No. 04: The Glitch Moment(um), Rosa Menkman|website=networkcultures.org|access-date=2016-03-17}} http://networkcultures.org/_uploads/NN%234_RosaMenkman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

She also wrote ''A Vernacular of File Formats''&lt;ref name="aVoFFhman"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slideshare.net/r00s/rosa-menkman-a-vernacular-of-file-formats-4923967 | title=A Vernacular of File Formats | publisher=Rosa Menkman | author=Menkman, Rosa |date= |website=Slideshare |access-date=26 December 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Glitch Studies Manifesto''&lt;ref name="glitchman"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://networkcultures.org/wpmu/portal/publications/inc-readers/video-vortex-ii/ | title=Video Vortex Reader II: moving images beyond YouTube | publisher=Institute of Network Cultures | author=Menkman, Rosa | article=Glitch Studies Manifesto | year=2011 | location=Amsterdam | pages=336–347 | isbn=9789078146124}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year. The manifesto was awarded 'best practice' by Virtueel Platform, then sector institute for [[Internet culture|e-culture]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="vp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://virtueelplatform.nl/best-practice/glitch-studies-manifesto/ | title=Best Practice / Glitch Studies Manifesto | publisher=Virtueel Platform | accessdate=1 June 2014 | author=Hamers, Eveleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of ''Network Notebook #04: The Glitch Moment(um)'' coincided with the [[GLI.TC/H]] festival, organized by Menkman in collaboration with American artists Nick Briz and Jon Satrom.

'''''Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Colouring Book''''' is a 2013 [[colouring book]] for adults by [[Johanna Basford]]. The book has been translated into 14 languages and has sold more than a million copies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Keiligh |date=March 5, 2015 |title=The colour of money: British author sells more than a million copies around the world of her colouring-in books for grown-ups|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2981484/British-author-sells-million-copies-colouring-book-adults.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]] |location=[[UK]] |access-date=March 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming one of the best-selling books on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].&lt;ref name="BusinessTimes" /&gt; 

Basford had been approached by [[Laurence King Publishing]] in 2011 after the publisher had seen Basford's work online. While the publisher originally wanted a colouring book for children, Basford proposed one for adults.&lt;ref name="BusinessTimes"/&gt;  Basford was inspired by several of her clients joking with her that they would enjoy colouring in her work, which was frequently done in [[black and white]].&lt;ref name="telegraph2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boztaz|first1=Senay|last2=Freeman|first2=Colin|title=Colouring-in craze causes pencil shortages|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/12199078/Colouring-in-craze-causes-pencil-shortages.html|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the publisher was reluctant to release such an unorthodox book.

[[File:Original manuscript of Death and the Maiden Quartet.jpeg|thumb|300px|Original manuscript of ''Death and the Maiden'' quartet, from the [[Mary Flagler Cary|Mary Flagler Cary Music Collection]], [[Morgan Library]], New York]]
[[File:T&amp;M.jpg|thumb|Original manuscript of ''Death and the Maiden'' quartet]]
The '''String Quartet No. 14 in D minor''', known as '''''Death and the Maiden''''', is a piece by [[Franz Schubert]] that has been called "one of the pillars of the [[chamber music]] repertoire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/string-quartet-no-14-death-and-maiden-franz-schubert|title=STRING QUARTET NO. 14 “DEATH AND THE MAIDEN”|last=Rothwell|first=Jessie|publisher=Los Angeles Philharmonic Association|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was composed in 1824, after the composer suffered a serious illness and realized that he was dying. It is named for the [[Theme (music)|theme]] of the second [[Movement (music)|movement]], which Schubert took from a [[Der Tod und das Mädchen|song he wrote in 1817 of the same title]]. Some interpret it as Schubert's testament to death, and find that the theme of death is palpable in all four movements of the quartet{{cn|date=May 2018}}.

The quartet was first played in 1826 in a private home, and was not published until 1831, three years after Schubert's death. It is D&amp;nbsp;810 in [[Otto Erich Deutsch]]'s [[Schubert Thematic Catalogue|thematic catalog of Schubert's works]].

==Composition==
1823 and 1824 were hard years for Schubert. For much of 1823 he was sick, some scholars believe with an outburst of tertiary stage syphilis, and in May had to be hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1982), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also without money: he had entered into a disastrous deal with [[Anton Diabelli|Diabelli]] to publish a batch of works, and received almost no payment; and his latest attempt at opera, ''[[Fierabras]]'', was a flop. In a letter to a friend, he wrote,

{{quote|Think of a man whose health can never be restored, and who from sheer despair makes matters worse instead of better. Think, I say, of a man whose brightest hopes have come to nothing, to whom love and friendship are but torture, and whose enthusiasm for the beautiful is fast vanishing; and ask yourself if such a man is not truly unhappy.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Leopold Kupelwieser, March 31, 1824, reprinted in Einstein (1947), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Franz Schubert by Wilhelm August Rieder 1875.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Franz Schubert in 1825 (painting by [[Wilhelm August Rieder]])]]
Yet, despite his bad health, poverty and depression, Schubert continued to turn out the tuneful, light and ''[[Gemütlichkeit|gemütlich]]'' music that made him the toast of Viennese society: the song cycle ''[[Die schöne Müllerin]]'', the [[Octet (Schubert)|octet]] for string quartet, contrabass, clarinet, horn and bassoon, more than 20 songs, and numerous light pieces for piano.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1982), pp. 106–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1820, Schubert returned to the string quartet form, which he had last visited as a teenager. He wrote the one-movement ''[[Quartettsatz, D 703 (Schubert)|Quartettsatz]]'' in 1820, and the ''[[String Quartet No. 13 (Schubert)|Rosamunde]]'' quartet in 1824 using a theme from the incidental music that he wrote for a play that failed. These quartets are a huge step forward from his initial attempts.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Griffiths (1983), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Even Schubert recognized this fact; in July 1824, he wrote his brother Ferdinand of his earlier quartets, "it would be better if you stuck to other quartets than mine, for there is nothing in them..."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Griffiths (1983), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several qualities that set these mature quartets apart from Schubert's earlier attempts. In the early quartets, it is primarily the first violin that carries the melody, with the other instruments playing supporting roles; in the later quartets, the part writing is much more advanced, and each instrument brings its own character and presence, for a more complex and integrated texture. Also, the later quartets are structurally much more integrated, with motifs, harmonies, and textures recurring in a way that ties the entire work together.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the differences between the early and late quartets, see Griffiths (1983), pp. 95–96, and Cobbett (1929), V II, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Baldung 006.jpg|thumb|upright|''{{Lang|de|Der Tod und das Mädchen}}'', [[Hans Baldung Grien]], 1517]]
But beyond these technical improvements, Schubert in these later works made the quartet medium his own. "He had now ceased to write quartets to order, for experimental study, or for the home circle," writes [[Walter Willson Cobbett]]. "To the independent artist... the string quartet had now also become a vehicle for conveying to the world his inner struggles."&lt;ref&gt;Cobbett (1929), Volume II, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; For Schubert, who lived a life suspended between the lyrical, romantic, charming and the dramatic, chaotic, and depressive, the string quartet offered a medium "to reconcile his essentially lyric themes with his feeling for dramatic utterance within a form that provided the possibility of extreme color contrasts," writes music historian Homer Ulrich.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich (1966), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schubert wrote the D minor quartet in March 1824,&lt;ref&gt;Composer and editor [[Franz Lachner]] mistakenly dated the quartet to 1826, when it was first played in public. Brown (1982), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; within weeks of completing the A minor [[String Quartet No. 13 (Schubert)|''Rosamunde'' quartet]]. He apparently planned to publish a three-set volume of quartets; but the Rosamunde was published within a year, while the D minor quartet was only published in 1831, three years after Schubert's death, by Diabelli.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1984), p. 72. The urtext score is published by Baerenreiter Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first played in January 1826 at the Vienna home of Karl and Franz Hacker, amateur violinists, apparently with Schubert on the viola.&lt;ref&gt;Berger (2001), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
The quartet takes its name from the [[lied]] "[[Der Tod und das Mädchen]]", D&amp;nbsp;531, a setting of the poem of the same name by [[Matthias Claudius]] that Schubert wrote in 1817. The theme of the song forms the basis of the second movement of the quartet. The theme is a death knell that accompanies the song about the terror and comfort of death.

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;''The Maiden'':
"Oh! leave me! Prithee, leave me! thou grisly man of bone!
For life is sweet, is pleasant.
Go! leave me now alone!
Go! leave me now alone!"

''Death'':
"Give me thy hand, oh! maiden fair to see,
For I'm a friend, hath ne'er distress'd thee.
Take courage now, and very soon
Within mine arms shalt softly rest thee!"&lt;ref&gt;Translation by P. Jurgenson, c. 1920 in Chaliapin (c. 1920), p. 40. The translation is somewhat free, here is a more literal rendering:
''The Maiden'':
"Away! Ah, Away! thou cruel man of bone!
I am still young. Go, instead.
And do not touch me!"
''Death'':
"Give me thy hand, you fair and tender creature,
I'm a friend, and do not come to punish.
Be of good courage; I am not cruel
You shall sleep gently in my arms."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

But it is not only this theme of the quartet that recalls death. The quote from the song "makes explicit the overriding theme of the work, its bleak vision and almost unremitting foreboding," writes Andrew Clements.&lt;ref&gt;Clements (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; From the violent opening unison. the first movement runs a relentless race through terror, pain and resignation, ending with a dying D minor chord. "The struggle with Death is the subject of the first movement, and the andante accordingly dwells on Death's words," writes Cobbett.&lt;ref name=C359&gt;Cobbett (1929), V II, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; After a scherzo movement, with a trio that provides the only lyrical respite from the depressing mood of the piece, the quartet ends with a [[tarantella]] – the traditional dance to ward off madness and death. "The finale is most definitely in the character of a dance of death; ghastly visions whirl past in the inexorable uniform rhythm of the tarantella," writes Cobbett.&lt;ref name=C359 /&gt;

So strong is the association of death with the quartet that some analysts consider it to be [[Program music|programmatic]], rather than [[absolute music]]. "The first movement of Schubert's ''Death and the Maiden'' string quartet can be interpreted in a quasi-programmatic fashion, even though it is usually viewed as an abstract work," writes Deborah Kessler.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian Frank Ruppert sees the quartet as a musical expression of Judaeo-Christian religious myths. "This quartet, like so many of Schubert's works, is a kind of para-liturgy," he writes. Each movement is about a different episode in the mythic process of death and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Ruppert (2009), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The quartet throughout is characterized by sudden dramatic shifts from [[fortissimo]] to [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]], from the lyrical to the compelling and dramatic. A driving undercurrent of triplets is a recurring motif in all four movements.&lt;ref&gt;For more analyses, see Loft (1992), pp. 161–183, Heuss (1919), pp. 120 et seq., or [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/discoveringmusic/listeninglibrary.shtml ''Death and the Maiden''] in the BBC Discovering Music: Listening Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four movements:
# [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Allegro]], in [[D minor]] and [[common time]] ({{music|time|4|4}})
# [[Andante (tempo)|Andante]] con moto, in [[G minor]] and [[cut time]] ({{music|time|2|2}})
# [[Scherzo]]: Allegro molto, in D minor and [[3/4 time|{{music|time|3|4}} time]]
# [[Presto (music)|Presto]], in D minor and {{music|time|6|8}} time

===First movement: Allegro===
{|
|-
|In the 14-[[bar (music)|measure]] introduction, Schubert establishes the elements that will carry through the entire movement. The quartet begins with a unison D, played fortissimo, and a [[triplet (music)|triplet]] figure, that establishes the triplet [[motif (music)|motif]]. Three and a half measures of fortissimo break off into a sudden, pianissimo [[chorale]], the first of the many violent shifts of mood that occur throughout.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 1 opening.ogg|thumb|right|Opening of the quartet&lt;ref&gt;Musical examples are taken from the performance of the Yorkside quartet (Kensho Watanabe and Andrew Paik, violins, Jonathan Bregman, viola, Scott McCreary, cello) at Yale University, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
|-
|After the introduction, Schubert presents the first [[theme (music)|theme]]: a continuation of the chorale motif, but with the triplets motif rippling through the lower voices, in a restless, unremitting stream.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 1 first theme.ogg|thumb|Main theme of the movement]]
|-
|The triplet motif is transmuted into a connecting theme of its own, leading to the second theme in [[F major]].
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 1 second theme.ogg|thumb|Second theme]]
|-
|The second theme is repeated, with an accompaniment of [[sixteenth note]]s.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 1 second theme w 16ths.ogg|thumb|Second theme, with 16th notes accompaniment]]
|-
|The sixteenth note passage [[modulation (music)|modulates]] through a range of [[Key signature|keys]], finally settling on [[A major]], where it continues as an [[accompaniment]] to a restatement of the second theme in the second violin. The exposition ends with a transformation of the second theme, this time wrenched into a violent outburst in [[A minor]].
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 1 end development.ogg|thumb|End of the exposition]]
|-
|The [[musical development|development]] concentrates on the two forms of the second theme: the lilting, quiet version, and the violent inverted form. The section fluctuates between a fading relaxation and fortissimo. Toward the end of the development, Schubert reintroduces the triplet motif of the first theme, leading to the [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]].
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 1 development.ogg|thumb|Development. The maiden remonstrates against Death, Death wheedles and cajoles]]
|-
|Here the opening themes return, with variants. The music moves to [[D major]], for a relaxed recapitulation of the second theme, then returns to D minor. A chorale reminiscent of the introduction leads to the [[coda (music)|coda]]. But even in the chorale, the tension does not relax, with a sudden fortepiano interrupting the quiet. The opening theme returns, played at a rushed tempo, like a sudden resurgence of life, growing to a climax that suddenly breaks off and the triplet motif, played at the original slower tempo, dies away to the end of the movement.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 1 end.ogg|thumb|End of the first movement. The maiden is close to death. Suddenly a spurt of life, hope, the music rushes and moves to major. But then, a return to minor, and the music pulses to its death]]
|}

===Second movement: Andante con moto===
{|
|-
|The second movement is a theme and five variations, based on the theme from the Schubert Lied. The theme is like a death march in G minor, ending on a G major chord. Throughout the movement, Schubert does not deviate from the basic harmonic and sentence structure of the 24-measure theme. But each variation expresses a profoundly different emotion.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 2 theme.ogg|thumb|right|Theme of the second movement]]
|-
|In the first variation, a lilting violin descant floats above the theme, played in pulsing triplets in the second violin and viola that recall the triplets of the first movement.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 2 var 1.ogg|thumb|right|First variation]]
|-
|In the second variation, the cello carries the theme, with the first violin playing the pulsating role – this time in sixteenth notes.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 2 var 2.ogg|thumb|right|Second variation]]
|-
|After two relaxed variations, the third variation returns to the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' character of the overall piece: a galloping ''fortissimo'' figure breaks off suddenly into ''piano''; the violin plays a variant of the theme in a high register, while the inner voices continue the gallop.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 2 var 3.ogg|thumb|right|Third variation]]
|-
|The fourth variation is again lyrical, with the second violin and cello carrying the melody under a long violin line in triplets. This is the only variation in a major key – G major.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 2 var 4.ogg|thumb|right|Fourth variation]]
|-
|In the fifth variation, the second violin takes up the theme, while the first violin plays a sixteenth-note arpeggiated motif, with the cello playing the triplets in the bass. The variation grows from ''pianissimo'' to ''fortissimo'', then again fades and slows in pace, finally returning to a restatement of the theme – this time in G major.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 2 var 5.ogg|thumb|right|Fifth variation]]
|}

===Third movement: Scherzo Allegro molto===
[[File:Yorkside Quartet Death and the Maiden Mvt 3 theme.ogg|thumb|right|Theme of the scherzo movement]]
[[File:Yorkside Quartet Death and the Maiden Mvt 3 trio.ogg|thumb|right|Trio section of the scherzo]]
Cobbett describes the third movement as the "dance of the demon fiddler".&lt;ref name=C359 /&gt; There is indeed something demonic in this fast-paced scherzo, full of syncopations and, like the other movements, dramatic leaps from ''fortissimo'' to ''pianissimo''.

The scherzo is designed as a classical minuet: two strains in {{music|time|3|4}} time, repeated, in D minor, followed by a contrasting trio section in D major, at a slower tempo, and ending with a recapitulation of the opening strains. The trio section is the only real respite from the compelling pace of the whole quartet: a typically Schubertesque melody, with the first violin playing a dancing descant above the melody line in the lower voices, then the viola takes the melody as the first violin plays high eighth notes.

The scherzo is a short movement, serving as an interlude leading to the frenetic last movement.

===Fourth movement: Presto===
The finale of the quartet is a [[tarantella]] in [[rondo]]-sonata form, in D minor. The tarantella is a breakneck Italian dance in 6/8 time, that, according to tradition, was a treatment for madness and convulsions brought on by the bite of a [[tarantula]] spider. Appropriately, Cobbett calls this movement "a [[Danse Macabre|dance of death]]."&lt;ref name=C359 /&gt;

The movement is built of sections. The first, main section recurs between each of the subsequent sections.

{|
|-
|The movement opens with the main section of the rondo in unison, with a theme based on a dotted figure. The theme is traditionally bowed in the reverse direction from the usual bowing of dotted passages.&lt;ref&gt;Down bow on the upbeat, up bow on the downbeat. This bowing is not marked in the ''urtext'' edition, but appears almost universally in all edited versions. See for example, the Peters edition, edited by Carl Herrmann.&lt;/ref&gt; This has the effect of moving the accent onto the off-beat, giving the entire passage the character of a limping dance.
|[[File:Yorkside Quartet Death and the Maiden Mvt 4 theme.ogg|thumb|right|Theme of the last movement]]
|-
|The theme develops characteristically, with sudden lurches from loud to soft and running triplets, leading to the second section of the rondo: a broad, chorale-like theme. Cobbett identifies this theme as a quote from another song of Schubert's, ''[[Der Erlkönig]]'', about a child who dies at the hands of king of the forest. The terrified child turns to his father for protection, but his father does not see the spirit, and ignores the child's pleas until the child is dead in his arms. "There is deep meaning in the appearance of this phrase," writes Cobbett.&lt;ref name=C359 /&gt; The chorale motif continues, with a flowing triplet accompaniment in the first violin that recalls the fourth variation of the ''Andante'' movement. This leads to a restatement of the main theme.
|[[File:Yorkside Quartet Death and the Maiden Mvt 4 B section.ogg|thumb|right|Second section: a chorale melody, with triplets accompanying]]
|-
|Here the triplet motif of the opening of the quartet also reappears, in disguised form. Then the chorale theme recurs, leading to the second statement of the main section.

The third section of the rondo begins. This is a complex, involuted section with chromatic swirls of triplets and [[hemiola]]s that cause the listener to lose all sense of downbeat. This leads into a recapitulation of the second section, and then a return of the main section of the rondo.
|[[File:Yorkside Quartet Death and the Maiden Mvt 4 C section.ogg|thumb|right|Third section: convoluted harmonies, offbeat rhythms]]
|-
|A crescendo leads to the ''Prestissimo'' coda of the movement and of the piece. The coda begins in D major, suggesting a triumphant end – a device common in classical and romantic quartets. But in this case, the coda suddenly returns to D minor, for a tumultuous and tragic conclusion.

After the initial reading of the quartet in 1826, the quartet was played again at a house concert in the home of composer [[Franz Lachner]], with violinist [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]] leading. Schuppanzigh, one of the leading violinists of the time, who debuted many of Beethoven's and Schubert's quartets, was reportedly unimpressed. "Brother, this is nothing at all, let well alone: stick to your Lieder," the aging Schuppanzigh is reported to have said to Schubert.&lt;ref&gt;Reminiscences by Lachner published in 1881 in the Viennese ''Presse'', retold at [http://www.fuguemasters.com/schubert.html#D810 ''Sierra Chamber Society Program Notes''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930015904/http://www.fuguemasters.com/schubert.html#D810 |date=2012-09-30 }} (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Schuppanzigh's impressions notwithstanding, Schubert's quartet soon won a leading place on the concert stage and in the hearts of musicians. "Only the excellence of such a work as Schubert's D minor Quartet... can in any way console us for the early and grievous death of this first-born of Beethoven; in a few years he achieved and perfected things as no one before him," wrote [[Robert Schumann]] of the quartet.&lt;ref&gt;Schumann, "A Retrospective View", in Schumann (1946) p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quartet has been honored by several transcriptions. In 1878, [[Robert Franz]] transcribed it for piano duet, and in 1896 [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] planned an arrangement for string orchestra and notated the details in a score of the quartet (the work was never completed, however, and only the second movement was written out and played; the modern revival of the arrangement is in a version edited by [[David Matthews (composer)|David Matthews]]).

In the 20th century, British composer [[John Foulds]] and American composer [[Andy Stein]] made versions for full symphony orchestra.

At [[Fridtjof Nansen]]'s state funeral in 1930, ''Death and the Maiden'' was performed instead of speeches.

The quartet has also inspired other works. [[Ariel Dorfman]]'s 1991 play ''[[Death and the Maiden (play)|Death and the Maiden]]'', [[Death and the Maiden (film)|adapted for film]] in 1994 by [[Roman Polanski]], is about a woman tortured and raped in a South American dictatorship, to the strains of the quartet. It has also appeared as incidental music in numerous films: ''[[The Portrait of a Lady (film)|The Portrait of a Lady]]'' ([[Jane Campion]], 1996), ''[[What? (film)|What?]]'' (Roman Polanski, 1972), ''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking]]'' (BBC production, 2004), and in [[Samuel Beckett]]'s radio play ''[[All That Fall]]'' (1962).

The '''''Tarot Garden''''' (Italian: '''''Il Giardino dei Tarocchi''''') is a [[sculpture garden]] based on the esoteric [[tarot]], created by the French artist [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] (1930–2002) in [[Pescia Fiorentina]], [[località]] ''Garavicchio'', in the municipality of [[Capalbio]], [[province of Grosseto]], [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]]. The park was opened to the public in 1998.

Niki de Saint Phalle, inspired by [[Antoni Gaudí]]´s [[Parc Güell]] in Barcelona, and [[Parco dei Mostri]] in Bomarzo, as well as [[Palais Idéal]] by [[Ferdinand Cheval]], and [[Watts Towers]] by [[Simon Rodia]],  decided to make something similar in design for her monumental sculpture park based on the [[Tarot]]. In 1979, she acquired some land on top of an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Ruins|ruin]] in Garavicchio, Tuscany, about 100 km north-west of Rome along the coast&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/niki-de-saint-phalles-tarot-garden|title=The Psychedelic Garden of Tuscany|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There she built the Giardino dei Tarocchi, containing twenty-two monumental figures representing her idea of the greater Mysteries of the tarot, constructed of reinforced concrete and covered with mirrors and ceramic mosaic.&lt;ref name="Pozzana146"&gt;Pozzana, Maria (2001). ''Gardens of Florence and Tuscany: A Complete Guide''. Giunti Editore. p. 146. {{ISBN|8809020642}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The figures can be walked through; the artist lived inside the [[sphinx]]-like ''Empress'' for several months during the construction of the garden.&lt;ref name="Pozzana146" /&gt;

'''''The Child's Bath''''' (or '''''The Bath''''') is an 1893 [[oil painting]] by American artist [[Mary Cassatt]]. The subject matter and the overhead perspective were inspired by Japanese [[Woodcut|woodblock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/111442 Painting profile] from the Art Institute of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/artaccess/AA_Impressionist/pages/IMP_6.shtml Art Access] at the Art Institute of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows dignity in motherhood and has a style similar to that of [[Degas]].

The [[Art Institute of Chicago]] acquired the piece in 1910. It has since become one of the most popular pieces in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Stein. "The Art Institute has compiled its 'greatest hits.' We asked art experts to expand that list of 11 to include other treasures." ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. 18 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
In 1891, Mary Cassatt created the oil painting with two subjects, a mother figure and a young child. The [[genre scene]] is based on the everyday bathing of a child, a moment that is "special by not being special".&lt;ref&gt;Janes, Karen Hosack. Great Paintings. New York: Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2011, 179. &lt;/ref&gt; The female figure holds up the child firmly and protectively with her left hand while the other hand carefully washes the child’s feet. The small and chubby left arm of the child braces against the mother’s thigh, while the other hand is clamped firmly on the child’s own thigh. The mother’s right hand presses firmly but still gently on the foot in the basin, mimicking the child’s own pressure on her thigh. To indicate depth, Cassatt painted the faces to recede into space. The paint strokes are layered and rough, creating thick lines that outline the figures and stand them out from the patterned background. The hand of the artist is evident through the roughness of the strokes and can be better viewed from a distance.

== Influences ==
Cassatt was heavily influenced by her fellow [[Impressionist]] peers, especially [[Edgar Degas]]. The first [[Impressionist]] painting to make it back to the United States was a [[pastel]] by Degas in 1875 that she purchased. Cassatt began to exhibit with the Impressionists in 1877, where she met other fellow Impressionists like [[Claude Monet]] and [[Berthe Morisot]]. In 1890, she was struck by the prints of the Japanese [[woodcuts]] at the [[Beaux-Arts Academy]] in Paris during the exhibition, three years prior to painting ''The Child's Bath''. Cassatt was drawn to the simplicity and clarity of the [[Japanese art|Japanese]] design, and the skillful use of blocks of color. The perspective of the painting was inspired by Japanese prints and Degas. "Japanese printmakers were more interested in decorative impact than precise perspective."&lt;ref&gt;Janes, Karen Hosack. Great Paintings. New York: Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2011, pg. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Death of Chione''''' is a 1622 painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]], his first known surviving work. He produced it during a stay in [[Lyon]] and in February 2016 it was acquired by that city's [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon|Museum of Fine Arts]]. It shows the death of [[Chione (daughter of Daedalion)|Chione]], lover of both [[Hermes]] and [[Apollo]] - she had compared her beauty to that of Apollo's sister [[Artemis]], who hunted her down and killed her by shooting an arrow through her tongue&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'', Book 11, lines 441-442&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld''''' is an American [[non-fiction]] book by [[Herbert Asbury]], first published in 1927 by Garden City Publishing Company.

==Description==
{{Further|List of identities in The Gangs of New York (book)}}
The book details the rise and fall of 19th century [[gang]]s in [[New York City]], prior to the domination of the [[Italian-American Mafia]] during [[Prohibition]] in the 1920s. Focusing on the saloon halls, gambling dens, and winding alleys of the [[Bowery]] and the [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] district of [[Lower Manhattan]], the book evokes the destitution and violence of a turbulent era, when colorfully named criminals like "Dandy" [[Johnny Dolan]], [[William Poole]] (also known as Bill the Butcher), and [[Hell-Cat Maggie]] lurked in the shadows, and infamous gangs including the [[Plug Uglies]], [[Dead Rabbits]], and [[Bowery Boys]] ruled the streets. It includes a [[rogues' gallery]] of [[prostitutes]], [[pimps]], poisoners, [[pickpockets]], murderers, and thieves.

==Adaptation==
The book was loosely adapted into the [[epic film|epic]] [[historical drama]] film ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002) by director [[Martin Scorsese]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4581">'''The Japanese Art Society of America''' (JASA) promotes the study and appreciation of [[Japanese art]]. Founded in 1973 as the Ukiyo-e Society of America by collectors of [[woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese prints]], the Society's mission has expanded to include related fields of Japanese art.

==History==
While the Society now addresses all aspects of Japanese art and culture, it traces its origins to a small group of [[ukiyo-e]] print collectors in and around New York City in 1973, at a time when Parke-Bernet Galleries (later to merge with [[Sotheby's]]) had begun to develop a market for Japanese art. The first major auction was the 1969 sale of the Blanche McFetridge estate, consisting of ukiyo-e prints once owned by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], followed by the 1972 sale of the estate of Hans Popper (1904–1971), a Viennese businessman who spent time working in Japan. His collection included masterpieces by [[Harunobu]], [[Utamaro]], [[Sharaku]] and [[Hokusai]], and the sale attracted many of the great collectors and dealers of the era, including [[Richard Pillsbury Gale]] (1900–1973) in Minnesota, [[Felix Tikotin]] (1893–1986), a dealer living in Switzerland, and Nishi Saiju (1927–1995), the first Japanese dealer to attend a sale in the United States.

JASA entered its fourth decade under the direction of [[Joan Baekeland]] as president, and the long-time Chicago collector George Mann as vice president. The current president is Dr. Susan Peters. Today, JASA has some 400 members from countries around the world, including Japan.

==Activities==
Through its annual lectures, seminars and other events, the Society provides a forum for the exchange ideas and experiences about traditional and contemporary arts of Japan.

The Society also sponsors exhibitions, such as ''Designed for Pleasure: The World of Edo Japan in Prints and Paintings, 1680–1860'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiasociety.org/media/press-releases/asia-society-presents-major-exhibition-japanese-woodblock-prints-and-paintings/ Asia Society Presents Major Exhibition of Japanese Woodblock Prints And Paintings]&lt;/ref&gt; which was shown at Asia Society in New York City in Spring 2008.

==Programs and publications==
Programs for members and the public remain the focus of the Society: in 2009, for example, members had tea in the Japanese teahouse at [[Kykuit]], the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills near Tarrytown, New York; visited private and public collections in Sacramento and San Francisco; and toured the Richard Fishbein and Estelle Bender Collection as well as the mini-museum of the [[Mary Griggs Burke|Mary Griggs Burke Collection]] in New York City. Lecture programs in New York are held at the [[New York University Institute of Fine Arts]] and elsewhere. 

The programs and publications of the Society were valuable in the 1970s, when ukiyo-e studies and, for that matter, [[Edo period]] art history had scarcely entered the academic mainstream either in the United States or Japan.{{cn|date=January 2015}} 

The society publishes a quarterly newsletter for members as well as an annual journal, ''Impressions.'' ({{ISSN|1095-2136}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japaneseartsoc.org/publications.htm/ Japanese Art Society publications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Art Index'', Jan. 2010, New York, H. W. Wilson Co., Vol. 81, No. 1, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Impressions'' was the recipient of the 2009 Donald Keene Prize for the Promotion of Japanese Culture,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keenecenter.org/content/view/53/75/ 2009 Donald Keene Prize for the Promotion of Japanese Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; awarded by the [[Donald Keene]] Center, [[Columbia University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6328">'''Thematic transformation''' (also known as '''thematic metamorphosis''' or '''thematic development''') is a musical technique in which a [[leitmotif]], or theme, is developed by changing the theme by using [[Permutation (music)|permutation]] ([[Transposition (music)|transposition]] or [[Modulation (music)|modulation]], [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], and [[Retrograde (music)|retrograde]]), [[augmentation (music)|augmentation]], [[diminution]], and [[Fragmentation (music)|fragmentation]].  It was primarily developed by [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Hector Berlioz]]. The technique is essentially one of [[variation (music)|variation]]. A basic theme is reprised throughout a musical work, but it undergoes constant transformations and disguises and is made to appear in several contrasting roles. However, the transformations of this theme will always serve the purpose of "unity within variety" that was the architectural role of [[sonata form]] in the classical symphony. The difference here is that '''thematic transformation''' can accommodate the dramatically charged phrases, highly coloured melodies and atmospheric harmonies favored by the Romantic composers, whereas sonata form was geared more toward the more objective characteristics of [[absolute music]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, while thematic transformation is similar to variation, the effect is usually different since the transformed theme has a life of its own and is no longer a sibling to the original theme.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''New Grove 2'', 25:694.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Liszt was not the first composer to use thematic transformation. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] had already used thematic transformation in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]], and [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], where the "Ode to Joy" theme is transformed at one point into a Turkish march, complete with [[cymbal]]s and [[drum]]s. [[Franz Schubert]] used metamorphosis to bind together the four movements of his ''[[Wanderer Fantasy]]'', a work which influenced Liszt greatly. However, Liszt perfected the technique by creating entire structures from metamorphosis alone.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 310.&lt;/ref&gt;  He may have already had experience in metamorphosing themes into various shapes in his early operatic fantasies and improvisations&lt;ref&gt;Searle, "Orchestral," 282.&lt;/ref&gt; and been also led to this practice by the [[sonata form#Monothematic expositions|monothematicism]] Liszt employed in many of his original works, including most of the [[Transcendental Etudes]].&lt;ref&gt;Searle, ''New Grove'', 11:34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Conservative critics in Liszt's time viewed thematic transformation as merely a substitution of repetition for the [[musical development]] demanded by [[sonata form]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the evocative, atmospheric melodies which Romantic composers such as Liszt tended to prefer left him little choice. These melodies, complete in themselves, already bore all the emotion and musical interest which they could hold; therefore, they could not be developed any further. The only apparent course open was to substitute a form of repetition for true development—in other words, to say in a different way what had already been said and trust the beauty and significance of what are fundamentally variations to supply the place of the development section demanded by sonata form.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Liszt's own view of repetition was more positive than that of his critics. He wrote, "It is a mistake to regard repetition as a poverty of invention. From the standpoint of the public it is indispensable for the understanding of the thought, while from the standpoint of Art it is almost identical with the demands of clarity, structure, and effectiveness."&lt;ref name="wq322"&gt;Quoted in Walker, 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In perfecting this compositional method, Liszt made what some critics consider a lasting contribution to the history of musical form&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 309.&lt;/ref&gt; since thematic transformation became a regular part of later 19th-century music, especially at the hands of Liszt's followers.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''New Grove 2'', 25:694.&lt;/ref&gt; Liszt authority [[Humphrey Searle]] points out that "the serial methods of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schönberg]], for instance, use precisely the methods of Liszt's thematic transformation within the framework of an entirely different [musical] language."&lt;ref&gt;Searle, ''Music'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Gustav Holst]] heavily used thematic transformation in their compositions.

In contemporary [[literary studies]], a '''theme''' is the central topic a text treats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/200321?rskey=8toWeL&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid
| title = Oxford English Dictionary
| work = 
| publisher = 
| accessdate = January 26, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes  can be divided into two categories: a work's ''thematic concept'' is what readers "think the work is about" and its ''thematic statement'' being "what the work says about the subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Griffith| first = Kelley| title = Writing Essays about Literature| place = | publisher = Cengage Learning| year = 2010| edition = 8| page =40| language =| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a05Efo1hOa4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=| isbn =1428290419| accessdate=  February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common contemporary understanding of theme is an idea or point that is central to a story, which can often be summed in a single word (e.g. love, death, betrayal). Typical examples of themes of this type are conflict between the individual and society; coming of age; humans in conflict with technology; [[nostalgia]]; and the dangers of unchecked ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Kirszner| first = Laura G. | last2 =Mandell| first2 =Stephen R.| title = Fiction: Reading, Reacting, Writing| publisher =Paulinas| year =1994| pages =3–4| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VzojstMHtY0C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=| isbn =015501014X | accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{examples needed |date=March 2013}} A theme may be exemplified by the actions, utterances, or thoughts of a character in a novel. An example of this would be the thematic idea of loneliness in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', wherein many of the characters seem to be lonely. It may differ from the thesis—the text's or author's implied worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Weitz| first = Morris| title = Shakespeare Survey| publisher =Cambridge University Press| volume = 28| year = 2002| chapter = Literature Without Philosophy: "Antony and Cleopatra"| page =30| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-CdmtQURHc8C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=| isbn =0521523656| accessdate= February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{example needed | march 2013}}

A story may have several themes. Themes often explore historically common or cross-culturally recognizable ideas, such as ethical questions, and are usually implied rather than stated explicitly. An example of this would be whether one should live a seemingly better life, at the price of giving up parts of one's humanity, which is a theme in [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley’s]] ''Brave New World''. Along with [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Character (arts)|character]], [[Setting (fiction)|setting]], and [[Style (fiction)|style]], theme is considered one of the [[literary element|components]] of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Obstfeld|2002|pp=1,65,115,171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Various [[Literary technique|techniques]] may be used to express many more themes.

===Leitwortstil===
''Leitwortstil'' is the repetition of a wording, often with a theme, in a narrative to make sure it catches the reader's attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last= Pinault| first= David| title= Story Telling Techniques in the "Arabian Nights"| publisher= Brill| series= Studies in Arabic Literature| volume= 15| year= 1992| page= 18| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=guHmLGJMbg4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq= | isbn= 9004095306 | accessdate= February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a leitwortstil is the recurring phrase, "So it goes", in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]''. Its seeming message is that the world is [[deterministic]]: that things only could have happened in one way, and that the future already is predetermined. But given the anti-war tone of the story, the message perhaps is on the contrary, that ''things could have been different''. A non-fictional example of leitwortstil is in the book ''Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart: Thirty True Things You Need to Know Now'' written by Gordon Livingston, which is an anthology of personal anecdotes multiple times interjected by the phrases "Don't do the same thing and expect different results", "It is a bad idea to lie to yourself", and "No one likes to be told what to do".

===Thematic patterning===
''Thematic patterning'' means the insertion of a recurring motif in a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Pinault, David. 1992. ''Story-telling techniques in the Arabian nights''. Leiden: Brill. p. 22. {{ISBN|9004095306}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, various scenes in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' are about loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Scalia| first = Joseph E.| last2 =Shamblin| first2 =Lena T. &amp; Research and Education Association | title =  John Steinbeck's Of mice and men| place =Piscataway, N.J | publisher =Research &amp; Education Association | year =2001| page =13| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=96WfEbkKIKAC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=| isbn =087891997X | accessdate= February 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thematic patterning is evident in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'',&lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath|title=Reviewed work(s) ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–360 [359–60]|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt; an example being the story of "The City of Brass". According to David Pinault, the overarching theme of that tale, in which a group of travelers roam the desert in search of ancient brass artifacts, is that "riches and pomp tempt one away from God".&lt;ref name="Pinault_23"&gt;Pinault, David. 1992. ''Story-telling techniques in the Arabian nights''. Leiden: Brill. p. 23. {{ISBN|9004095306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative is interrupted several times by stories within the story. These include a tale recorded in an inscription found in the palace of Kush ibh Shaddad; a story told by a prisoner about Solomon; and an episode involving Queen Tadmur's corpse. According to Pinault, "each of these minor narratives introduces a character who confesses that he once proudly enjoyed worldly prosperity: subsequently, we learn, the given character has been brought low by God ... These minor tales ultimately reinforce the theme of the major narrative".&lt;ref name="Pinault_23"/&gt;

== Examples ==
Some common themes in literature are "love," "war," "revenge," "betrayal,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; "patriotism," "grace," "isolation," "motherhood," "forgiveness," "wartime loss,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; "treachery," "rich versus poor," "appearance versus reality," and "help from other-worldly powers."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brown|Rosenberg|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[locomotive]] or [[train]] can play many roles in art, for example:
* As a [[work of art]] in itself in addition to most functional considerations, especially in [[Streamliner|streamlined]] steam locomotives and luxury passenger accommodations of the early 20th century, known also as the [[Machine Age]]
* As a subject for a [[:Category:Rail transport in fiction|novel]] or [[:Category:Rail transport films|film]]
* As a [[metaphor]] in song or poetry, particularly for [[Power (physics)|physical power]] or directed movement (physical, ''romantic'' or other), as in ''[[Fisherman's Blues]]'':&lt;!--This should be short enough to qualify as fair use --&gt;

'''''Valori plastici''''' (meaning ''Plastic Values'' in English) was an [[Italy|Italian]] magazine published in [[Rome]] in [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]]. The magazines existed between 1918 and 1922.

==History and profile==
''Valori plastici'' was established in [[Rome]] by the painter and art collector [[Mario Broglio]] (1891-1948) in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valori Plastici|url=http://www.kettererkunst.com/dict/valori-plastici.php|publisher=Ketterer Kunst|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. S. Di Piero|title=Out of Eden: Essays on Modern Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PraAA_pqCfEC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=23 January 2015|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-07065-3|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also edited the magazine which focused on [[aesthetic]] ideals and [[metaphysical art|metaphysical]] artwork. It supported the art movement ''[[Return to order]]'' so as to create a change of direction from the extreme [[avant-garde]] art of the years up to 1918, taking its inspiration from traditional art instead.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. P. Fossati, ''Valori plastici, 1918-22'' (Essays), [[Giulio Einaudi Editore|Einaudi]] (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "return to order" to describe this renewed interest in tradition is said to derive from ''Le rappel a l'ordre'', a book of essays by the poet and artist [[Jean Cocteau]] published in 1926. The movement itself  was a reaction to the War.  [[Cubism]] was abandoned even by its creators, [[Braque]] and [[Picasso]], and [[Futurism]], which had praised machinery, violence and war, was rejected by most of its followers.  The return to order was associated with a [[Neo-classicism|revival of classicism]] and realistic painting.

The magazine theorised the retrieval of national and [[Italic peoples|Italic]] values, as promoted by the cultural policies of [[fascism]], but also looking at wider horizons within [[Europe]] and using a vivid artistic [[dialectics]] with a return to a classic [[figurative art|figurative]] source.

[[Alberto Savinio]],&lt;ref&gt;Real name Andrea Francesco Alberto de Chirico (25 August 1891 - 5 May 1952) was an Italian writer, painter, musician, journalist, essayist, playwright, set designer and composer. He was the younger brother of '[[Metaphysical art|metaphysical]]' painter [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. His work often dealt with [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[psychology|psychological]] themes, and he also was heavily concerned with the philosophy of art. Cf. ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'' s.v., p. 264. Detroit: Thomson Gale, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1st issue of ''Valori plastici'' on 15 November 1918, announced a programme of total individualistic, anti-[[futurism|futurist]] and anti-[[Bolshevik]] restoration. In his first article of April–May 1919, entitled ''Anadioménon'', Savinio expounds the intellective and enigmatically atemporal intuition which animates the world of this new "[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] classicism".&lt;ref&gt;L. Parkinson Zamora, ''Magical Realism: Theory, History, Community'', Duke University (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alberto Savinio|Savinian]] principles on [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] poetics are applied to [[painting]] by [[Giorgio de Chirico]], by [[Carlo Carrà]] and [[Giorgio Morandi]].

Although terminating its publication in 1921, the ideas of ''Valori plastici'' will spread outside [[Italy]] with the ''[[Return to order]]'' movement and helps in understanding the parallel histories of [[Futurism]] with [[poet]] and [[playwright]] [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and that of [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolism]] with [[Giovanni Pascoli]] and [[Decadentism]] with [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Monk Testing Wine - Antonio Casanova y Estorach.jpg|thumb|''Monk Testing Wine'' by [[:es:Antonio Casanova y Estorach|Antonio Casanova y Estorach]] (c.1886)]]
'''Wine tasting''' is the sensory examination and evaluation of [[wine]]. While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters (such as [[sommelier]]s or buyers for [[retailer]]s) use a constantly evolving specialized terminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use similar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more general, personal appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Peynaud, Émile (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nzehk2Vu5K8C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=wine+tasting+aims&amp;ei=_9nIRvLrCJSS7QKiu9zfDw&amp;sig=LmyRAwE8FKHf-N4Bz3rOWXEkGsY#PPA2,M1  ''The Taste of Wine: The Art and Science of Wine Appreciation'', London: Macdonald Orbis, p1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Results contradicting the reliability of wine tasting in both experts and consumers have surfaced through scientific [[blind wine tasting]], such as inconsistency in identifying wines based on region and price.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, Robert T., [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8545711 "How Expert are "Expert" Wine Judges?"], ''Journal of Wine Economics'', Vol. 4; Issue 02 (Winter 2009), pp. 233–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Sumer|Sumerian]] stories of [[Gilgamesh]] in the 3rd millennium BCE differentiate the popular beers of [[Mesopotamia]], as well as wines from [[Zagros Mountains]] or [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;Émile Peynaud, '' The taste of wine '', p.1 Dunod, 2013 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=Wfb7AAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=le%20gout%20du%20vin%20peynaud&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google books link]&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth century BCE, [[Plato]] listed the main flavors of wine, and classified the aromas as "species", or families.

[[Aristotle]] proposed a sensory tasting defined by the [[four elements]] (air, water, fire, and earth) further deepened by the Roman noblewoman [[Lucretia]] in the first century BCE.

Although the practice of tasting is as old as the history of wine, the term "tasting" first appeared in 1519.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tasting: Definition and etymology | url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/degustation | website=cnrtl.fr | date = | accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology of wine tasting was formalized by the 18th century when [[Linnaeus]], Poncelet, and others brought an understanding of tasting up to date.

In 2004, [[Richard Axel]] and [[Linda B. Buck]], won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their contribution to the knowledge of the senses of taste and smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Cell |date=1991 Apr 5 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=175-87 |pmid=1840504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tasting stages==
[[File:Porto.Grahams02.jpg|thumb|right|Ready tasting room of [[port wine]] in a [[wine cellar]] of a producer]]
The results of the four recognized stages to wine tasting:
* appearance
* "in glass" the [[aroma of the wine]]
* "in mouth" sensations
* "finish" ([[aftertaste]])&lt;ref&gt;Ronald S. Jackson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=n0z8XCvAS9EC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=wine+tasting+aims&amp;ei=md3IRrebI5SE7AKk6tzfDw&amp;sig=_ynh2E9B7eRT7ta9AbrpOL5qpaE#PPA2,M1 ''Wine Tasting: A Professional Handbook'', pp 2–3]&lt;/ref&gt;
– are combined in order to establish the following properties of a wine: 
* complexity and character
* potential (suitability for [[aging (wine)|aging]] or drinking)
* possible [[Wine fault|faults]]
A wine's overall quality assessment, based on this examination, follows further careful description and comparison with recognized standards, both with respect to other wines in its price range and according to known factors pertaining to the region or vintage; if it is typical of the region or diverges in style; if it uses certain [[wine-making]] techniques, such as barrel [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] or [[malolactic fermentation]], or any other remarkable or unusual characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Peynaud, Émile (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nzehk2Vu5K8C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=wine+tasting+aims&amp;ei=_9nIRvLrCJSS7QKiu9zfDw&amp;sig=LmyRAwE8FKHf-N4Bz3rOWXEkGsY#PPA2,M1  ''The Taste of Wine: The Art and Science of Wine Appreciation'', London: Macdonald Orbis, p2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NorCal2018 Castello di Amorosa Wine Tasting Napa Valley S0151015.jpg|thumb|Wine tasting at [[Castello di Amorosa]], Napa Valley]]

Whereas wines are regularly tasted in isolation, a wine's quality assessment is more objective when performed alongside several other wines, in what are known as tasting "flights". Wines may be deliberately selected for their [[vintage]] ("horizontal" tasting) or proceed from a single [[winery]] ("vertical" tasting), to better compare [[vineyard]] and vintages, respectively. Alternatively, in order to promote an unbiased analysis, bottles and even glasses may be disguised in a "blind" tasting, to rule out any prejudicial awareness of either vintage or winery.

==Blind tasting==
{{Main|Blind wine tasting}}
To ensure impartial judgment of a wine, it should be served ''blind'' – that is, without the taster(s) having seen the label or bottle shape. Blind tasting may also involve serving the wine from a black wine glass to mask the [[wine color|color]] of the wine. A taster's judgment can be prejudiced by knowing details of a wine, such as geographic origin, price, reputation, color, or other considerations.

Scientific research has long demonstrated the [[Placebo|power of suggestion in perception]] as well as the strong effects of expectancies. For example, people expect more expensive wine to have more desirable characteristics than less expensive wine. When given wine that they are falsely told is expensive they virtually always report it as tasting better than the very same wine when they are told that it is inexpensive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928231853/http://www.academie-amorim.com/us/laureat_2001/brochet.pdf Chemical Object Representation in the Field of Consciousness – Frédéric Brochet]&lt;/ref&gt; French researcher Frédéric Brochet "submitted a mid-range Bordeaux in two different bottles, one labeled as a cheap table wine, the other bearing a grand cru etiquette." Tasters described the supposed grand cru as "woody, complex, and round" and the supposed cheap wine as  "short, light, and faulty."

Similarly, people have expectations about wines because of their [[List of wine producing regions|geographic origin]], [[winery|producer]], vintage, color, and many other factors. For example, when Brochet served a white wine he received all the usual descriptions: "fresh, dry, honeyed, lively." Later he served the same wine dyed red and received the usual red terms: "intense, spicy, supple, deep."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210308/http://www.seattleweekly.com/2002-02-20/news/wine-snob-scandal.php Wine Snob Scandal – Brochet's work on dyed wine]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous instances of blind testing is known as the [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|Judgment of Paris]], a [[wine competition]] held in 1976 where French judges blind-tested wines from [[France]] and [[California]]. Against all expectations, [[California wines]] bested [[French wines]] according to the judges, a result which would have been unlikely in a non-blind contest. This event was depicted in the 2008 movie ''[[Bottle Shock]]''.

===Price bias===
Another well-publicized double-blind taste test was conducted in 2011 by [[Richard Wiseman|Prof. Richard Wiseman]] of the [[University of Hertfordshire]].  In a wine tasting experiment using 400 participants, Wiseman found that general members of the public were unable to distinguish expensive wines from inexpensive ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Georgiou | first = Maroulla | title = Expensive and inexpensive wines taste the same, research shows | publisher = [[Phys.Org]] | date = Apr 15, 2011 | url = http://phys.org/news/2011-04-expensive-inexpensive-wines.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "People just could not tell the difference between cheap and expensive wine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Sample | first = Ian | title = Expensive wine and cheap plonk taste the same to most people | publisher = The Guardian | date = April 14, 2011 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/apr/14/expensive-wine-cheap-plonk-taste?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color bias===
In 2001, the [[University of Bordeaux]] asked 54 undergraduate students to test two glasses of wine: one red, one white. The participants described the red as "jammy" and commented on its crushed red fruit.  The participants failed to recognize that both wines were from the same bottle.  The only difference was that one had been colored red with a flavorless dye.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/23/wine-tasting-junk-science-analysis Wine-tasting: it's junk science; The Guardian; June 22, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0093934X01924939/1-s2.0-S0093934X01924939-main.pdf?_tid=c6c9ffa6-bc7a-11e5-ae11-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1452967301_69c3ad144ba81882e1b68bbb498d79d2 The Colour of Odors; Morrot, Brochet and Dubourdeiu; 28 August 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Geographic origin bias===
For 6 years, [[Texas A&amp;M University]] invited people to taste wines labeled "France", "California", "Texas", and while nearly all ranked the French as best, in fact, all three were the same Texan wine.  The contest is built on the simple theory that if people do not know what they are drinking, they award points differently than if they do know what they are drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/2005-04-08/265667/ Liquid Assets - A fair competition; The Austin Chronicle; April 8, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vertical and horizontal tasting==
'''Vertical and horizontal wine tastings''' are wine tasting events that are arranged to highlight differences between similar wines.
* In a '''vertical tasting''', different vintages of the same [[Wine#Wine styles|wine type]] from the same winery are tasted. This emphasizes differences between various vintages.
* In a '''horizontal tasting''', the wines are all from the same vintage but are from different wineries. Keeping wine variety or type and [[List of wine producing regions|wine region]] the same helps emphasize differences in winery styles.

==Tasting flights==
'''Tasting flight''' is a term used by wine tasters to describe a selection of wines, usually between three and eight glasses, but sometimes as many as fifty, presented for the purpose of sampling and comparison.

==Tasting notes==
A '''tasting note''' refers to a taster's written testimony about the aroma, taste identification, acidity, structure, texture, and balance of a wine. Online wine communities like [[Bottlenotes]] allow members to maintain their tasting notes online and for the reference of others.

==Serving temperature==
The temperature that a wine is served at can greatly affect the way it tastes and smells. Lower temperatures will emphasize [[acidity]] and [[tannins (wine)|tannin]]s while muting the [[aromatic]]s. Higher temperatures will minimize acidity and tannins while increasing the aromatics.

== Glassware ==
{{Main|Wine glass}}
The shape of a wineglass can have a subtle impact on the perception of wine, especially its bouquet.&lt;ref name="glass1"&gt;Huttenbrink, K., Schmidt, C., Delwiche, J., &amp; Hummel, T. (2001). The aroma of red wine is modified by the form of the wine glass. ''Laryno-Rhino-Otologie'', 80(2), 96–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glass2"&gt;Delwiche, J., &amp; Pelchat, M. (2002). Influence of glass shape on wine aroma. ''Journal of Sensory Studies'', 17(1), 19–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glass3"&gt;Hummel, T., Delwiche, J., Schmidt, C., &amp; Huttenbrink, K. (2003). Effects of the form of glasses on the perception of wine flavors: a study in untrained subjects. ''Appetite'', 41(2), 197–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the ideal shape is considered to be wider toward the bottom, with a narrower aperture at the top (tulip or egg shaped). Glasses which are widest at the top are considered the least ideal. Many wine tastings use [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] XL5 glasses,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} which are "egg"-shaped. The effect of glass shape does not appear to be related to whether the glass is pleasing to look at.&lt;ref name="glass3"/&gt;

== Wine color ==
Without having tasted the wines, one does not know if, for example, a white is heavy or light. Before taking a sip, the taster tries to determine the order in which the wines should be assessed by appearance and nose alone. Heavy wines will be deeper in [[wine color|color]] and generally more intense on the nose. Sweeter wines, being denser, will leave thick, [[viscous]] streaks (called ''legs'' or ''[[Tears of wine|tears]]'') down the inside of the glass when swirled.

==Process==
[[File:Tempranillowine.jpg|thumb|right|Judging [[wine color|color]] is the first step in tasting wine.]]
There are five basic steps in tasting wine: color, swirl, smell, taste, and savor.&lt;ref name=course&gt;Zraly, Kevin. ''Windows on the World: Complete Wine Course''; Sterling Publishing, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; These are also known as the "five S" steps: see, swirl, sniff, sip, savor. During this process, a taster must look for clarity, varietal character, integration, expressiveness, complexity, and connectedness.&lt;ref name=winebible&gt;MacNeil, Karen. ''The Wine Bible''; Workman Publishing, New York (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

A wine's color is better judged by putting it against a white background. The wine glass is put at an angle in order to see the colors. Colors can give the taster clues to the grape variety, and whether the wine was aged in wood.

===Characteristics assessed during tasting===
Varietal character describes how much a wine presents its inherent grape aromas.&lt;ref name="winebible"/&gt; A wine taster also looks for integration, which is a state in which none of the components of the wine ([[Acids in wine|acid]], tannin, alcohol, etc.) is out of balance with the other components. When a wine is well balanced, the wine is said to have achieved a harmonious fusion.&lt;ref name="winebible"/&gt;

Another important quality of the wine to look for is its expressiveness. Expressiveness is the quality the "wine possesses when its aromas and flavors are well-defined and clearly projected."&lt;ref name=winebible5&gt;MacNeil, Karen. ''The Wine Bible''; Workman Publishing, New York, p.5 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of the wine is affected by many factors, one of which may be the multiplicity of its flavors. The connectedness of the wine, a rather abstract and difficult to ascertain quality, describes the bond between the wine and its land of origin (terroir).&lt;ref name="winebible"/&gt;

===Connoisseur wine tasting===
A wine's quality can be judged by its bouquet and taste. The bouquet is the total aromatic experience of the wine. Assessing a wine's bouquet can also reveal faults such as [[cork taint]]; [[oxidation]] due to age, overexposure to oxygen, or lack of preservatives; and wild [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] or bacterial contamination, such as those due to [[Acetobacter]] or ''[[Brettanomyces]]'' yeasts.  Although low levels of ''Brettanomyces'' aromatic characteristics can be a positive attribute, giving the wine a distinctive character, generally it is considered a wine spoilage yeast.

The bouquet of wine is best revealed by gently swirling the wine in a wine glass to expose it to more oxygen and release more [[aromaticity|aromatic]]&lt;ref name=Gluckstern&gt;{{cite book | last=Gluckstern |first=Willie |title=The Wine Avenger |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; etheric, ester, and aldehyde molecules that comprise the essential components of a wine's bouquet.&lt;ref name=course/&gt; [[Sparkling wine]] should not be swirled to the point of releasing bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maisons-champagne.com/encyclopedie/vignes_au_plaisir/erreurs.htm |title=Eviter les erreurs Encyclopédie des Vignes au plaisir |publisher=Maisons-champagne.com |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pausing to experience a wine's bouquet aids the wine taster in anticipating the wine's flavors. The "nose" of a wine – its bouquet or aroma – is the major determinate of perceived flavor in the mouth. Once inside the mouth, the aromatics are further liberated by exposure to body heat, and transferred [[Human nose|retronasally]] to the [[olfactory receptor]] site. It is here that the complex taste experience characteristic of a wine actually commences.

Thoroughly tasting a wine involves perception of its array of taste and [[mouthfeel]] attributes, which involve the combination of textures, flavors, weight, and overall "structure". Following appreciation of its olfactory characteristics, the wine taster savors a wine by holding it in the mouth for a few seconds to saturate the [[taste bud]]s. By pursing ones lips and breathing through that small opening oxygen will pass over the wine and release even more esters. When the wine is allowed to pass slowly through the mouth it presents the connoisseur with the fullest gustatory profile available to the human palate.

The acts of pausing and focusing through each step distinguishes wine tasting from simple quaffing. Through this process, the full array of aromatic molecules is captured and interpreted by approximately 15 million olfactory receptors,&lt;ref name=Gluckstern /&gt; comprising a few hundred olfactory receptor classes. When tasting several wines in succession, however, key aspects of this fuller experience (length and finish, or aftertaste) must necessarily be sacrificed through expectoration.

Although taste qualities are known to be widely distributed throughout the oral cavity, the concept of an anatomical "[[tongue map]]" yet persists in the wine tasting arena, in which different tastes are believed to map to different areas of the tongue. A widely accepted example is the misperception that the tip of the tongue uniquely tells how sweet a wine is and the upper edges tell its acidity.&lt;ref name=Gluckstern /&gt;

==Scoring wine==
{{main|wine rating}}
{{See also|Wine tasting descriptors}}
As part of the tasting process, and as a way of comparing the merits of the various wines, wines are given scores according to a relatively set system. This may be either by explicitly weighting different aspects, or by global judgment (although the same aspects would be considered). These aspects are 1) the appearance of the wine, 2) the nose or smell, 3) the palate or taste, and 4) overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winepros.org/wine101/sensory_guide.htm Professional Friends of Wine]&lt;/ref&gt; Different systems weight these differently (e.g., appearance 15%, nose 35%, palate 50%). Typically, no modern wine would score less than half on any scale (which would effectively indicate an obvious fault). It is more common for wines to be scored out of 20 (including half marks) in Europe and parts of Australasia, and out of 100 in the US. However, different critics tend to have their own preferred system, and some gradings are also given out of 5 (again with half marks).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wine-searcher.com/wine-scores.lml Wine-Searcher]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visiting wineries ==
Traveling to wine regions is one way of increasing skill in tasting. Many wine producers in wine regions all over the world offer tastings of their wine. Depending on the country or region, tasting at the winery may incur a small charge to allow the producer to cover costs.

It is not considered rude to spit out wine at a winery, even in the presence of the wine maker or owner. Generally, a [[spittoon]] will be provided. In some regions of the world, tasters simply spit on the floor or onto gravel surrounding barrels. It is polite to inquire about where to spit before beginning tasting.

== Attending wine schools ==
A growing number of wine schools can be found, offering wine tasting classes to the public. These programs often help a wine taster hone and develop their abilities in a controlled setting. Some also offer professional training for sommeliers and winemakers. It is even possible to learn how to assess wine methodically via e-learning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wine Campus]] offers an Honours Brevet via e-learning&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expectoration ==
[[File:Crachoir by JM Rosier.JPG|thumb|upright|Spitting into a [[spittoon]] at a wine tasting.]]
Because intoxication can affect the consumer's judgment, wine tasters generally spit the wine out after they have assessed its quality at formal tastings, where dozens of wines may be assessed. However, since wine is absorbed through the skin inside the mouth, tasting from twenty to twenty-five samplings can still produce an intoxicating effect, depending on the alcoholic content of the wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Walton| first =Stuart| title =Cook's Encyclopedia of Wine| year=2005| publisher =Anness Publishing Limited 2002, 2005| pages = 10, 11| isbn = 0-7607-4220-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sensory analysis ==
Tasting plays an important role in the [[sensory analysis]] (also referred to as [[organoleptic]] analysis) of wine. Employing a [[trained panel|trained]] or consumer panel, [[Oenology|oenologists]] may perform a variety of tests on the taste, aroma, mouthfeel and appeal of wines. [[Discrimination testing|Difference tests]] are important in determining whether different fermentation conditions or new vineyard treatments alter the character of a wine, something particularly important to producers who aim for consistency. Preference testing establishes consumer preference, while descriptive analysis determines the most prominent traits of the wine, some of which grace back labels. Blind tasting and other laboratory controls help mitigate bias and assure statistically significant results. Many large wine companies now boast their own sensory team, optimally consisting of a Ph.D. sensory scientist, a flavor chemist and a trained panel.

== Grape varieties ==
Wine grape varieties are variously evaluated according to a wide range of descriptors which draw comparisons with other, non-grape flavors and aromas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winepros.org/wine101/grape_profiles/varietals.htm Varietal Profiles | Professional Friends of Wine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winestore.com/grape-varieties.php Grape Varieties Explained&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The following table provides a brief and by no means exhaustive summary of typical descriptors for the better-known varietals.

'''Wyoming Writers, Inc.''' was formed in 1974 to form a network of writers within the state and help fledgling writers acquire publication. An annual writers convention is held in various locations within the state as well as a writing contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://trib.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/wyoming-writers-announce-winners/article_78b7b8ba-e950-58c1-85cd-b19d13fb060c.html|title=Wyoming Writers announce winners|last=staff|first=the Star-Tribune|work=Casper Star-Tribune Online|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zenitism''' ({{Lang-sh|Zenitizam / Зенитизам}}) was an [[art]] movement in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] from 1921 until 1926, first in [[Zagreb]] from 1921 to 1924 and from 1924 in [[Belgrade]]. The movement was mainly involved in [[visual arts]], [[graphic design]], [[poetry]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[film]], [[architecture]] and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.nb.rs/zenit/english.html&lt;/ref&gt; Like other avant-garde movements at the time, it held anti-war, anti-bourgeois and anti-nationalist views and rejected traditional culture and art. Micić defined the movement as "abstract metacosmic expressionism."

Most of its ideas were communicated through the [[Zenit (magazine)|Zenit]] magazine which [[Ljubomir Micić]] launched and which published 43 issues.

==The movement==

The movement was established following [[World War I]], during which [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] lost a million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Erlikman, Vadim (2004). Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik. Moscow. {{ISBN|5-93165-107-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some artists from the region were known in Europe, Zenitism was the first notable art movement from the Balkans in Europe.

'''Zincography''' was a [[planographic printing]] process that used [[zinc]] plates. [[Alois Senefelder]] first mentioned zinc's [[Lithography|lithographic]] use as a substitute for [[Bavaria]]n [[limestone]] in his 1801 [[England|English]] [[patent]] specifications.&lt;ref&gt;K. Pearson, "Lithographic Maps in Nineteenth-Century Geographical Journals," Ph.D. Diss., the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1978, p. 69, citing Jules Desportes, "Notice sur la lithographie, sa découverte, ses progrès," ''Le Lithographie'' 3(1942), p. 74; J.-H.-Herman Hammann, ''Des Artes Graphiques destines à multiplier par l'impression, consideres sous le double point de vue historique et pratique'' Paris and Geneva: Joël Cherbuliez, Libraire-Editeur, 1857), p. 329; and "Zincographie", ''Le Lithographe'' 2 (1840): pp. 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834, [[Federico Lacelli]]  patented a zincographic printing process, producing large maps called géoramas.&lt;ref&gt;K. Pearson, "Lithographic Maps in Nineteenth-Century Geographical Journals," Ph.D. Diss., the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1978, citing Alfred Lemercier, ''La Lithographie française de 1796 à 1896 et les arts qui s'y rattachent; manuel pratique s'addressant aux artistes et aux imprimeurs'' (Paris: C. Lorilleux et Co., 1899), p. 189; and V. Raulin, "Note relative au coloriage des cartes par impression lithographique," ''Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences'' 20 (1845): pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837-1842, Eugène-Florent Kaeppelin perfected the process to create a large [[polychrome]] geologic map.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Wakeman, ''Aspects of Victorian Lithography, Anastatic Printing and Photozincography''.  Wymondham: Brewhouse Press, 1970, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Zinc plates could be obtained for less expense than fine lithographic limestone, and could be acquired at very large scale. Zinc was coated with a solution containing [[gallic acid]] and [[phosphoric acid]] that caused [[hygroscopic]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] to form on the plate's surface.  A printer would then cover the zinc plate with a coating of [[asphalt]] varnish, expose it under a drawing and develop it.  The zinc affected by the lines of the drawing proof would be coated with hygroscopic salts.  Bathing the plate in [[acetic acid]] resulted in the dissolution of the salts, the asphalt varnish protecting the remaining surfaces of the plate.  Then the printer would coat the plate with a colored lacquer varnish called [[fuchsine]], dried, dipped in [[benzene]].  This would dissolve the varnishes, leaving only the fuchsine varnish in the areas associated with the drawn lines, and hygroscopic salts elsewhere. The printer then wet the plate, the water localizing on the salts.  As in [[lithography]], ink applied to the plate was repelled by the hygroscopic areas, and attracted to the [[fuchsine]] areas. Sometimes zincographic printers created printing proofs on specially coated papers.&lt;ref&gt;See  Maison Nicéphore Niepce, “Zincography,” ''Bitumen After Niépce''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A scan of a small section of an 1862 map.jpg|250px|thumb|left|For this map each constituent plate was  printed approximately 6 3/4 by 4 3/4 inches on 6 inches to the mile scale.]]
Variants of the zincographic process included a form of early photographic engraving, [[photogravure]]:  zinc was coated with a light-sensitive [[albumen]]/[[chromium]] salt mixture, exposed in contact with a glass [[Negative (photography)|negative]], inked and the albumen removed by washing to create a single proof image.  The printer would then transfer the proof design to a zinc plate under a press, and hand-etch the drawing onto the plate with a stylus.  The plate was then rubbed with oil, which would not stick to the repellent coating, but adhere in the etched areas.  The printer could then ink the plate, and it would remain in the grooves.  As in [[chromolithography]], colors were printed in successive passes of the press, the plates kept in register.

Zincography is frequently confused with modern zinc-plate lithographic printing.  It directly influenced the development of [[photozincography]], an early form of [[photogravure]].
