==History==
The School was founded in 1982 by Rod Taylor and Heather Nicholson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Maureen |title=Adelaide Central School of Art: A short history |date=2004 |publisher=Gordon and Tippett |location=Adelaide, SA |isbn=097570320X |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Initially occupying a rented space in Bloor Court, Adelaide, it moved in 1988 to a warehouse in Gilles Street, establishing itself as an accredited independent art school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Maureen |title=Adelaide Central School of Art: A short history |date=2004 |publisher=Gordon and Tippett |location=Adelaide, SA |isbn=097570320X |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In January 1994, the School moved to heritage buildings in Osmond Terrace, Norwood, leasing them from the School's founder until they were sold in 2011.  Taylor retired in 2008 and was succeeded by Ingrid Kellenbach as CEO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nunn |first1=Louise |title=School's out for man of vision |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.rp.nla.gov.au/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=88396923-c076-476e-991e-d572dfbe8d7b%40sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=200809101027855324&amp;db=anh |publisher=The Advertiser (Adelaide) |accessdate=20 August 2018 |date=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New art school chief |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.rp.nla.gov.au/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=6530bbd7-9ab6-4358-b92b-335f789f1978%40sessionmgr4008&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=200810301015030668&amp;db=anh |publisher=The Advertiser (Adelaide) |accessdate=20 August 2018 |date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The new Glenside Campus provides facilities in the three-story Teaching and Studio Building, including spaces for classes, integrated student studios, lecture room, media room, enlarged library facilities and display space for artwork on each level.

In September 2018, the School announced that Penny Griggs, Director of the [[SALA Festival]], would succeed Ingrid Kellenbach as the School's CEO in November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McDonald |first1=Patrick |title=SALA Festival boss Penny Griggs to succeed Ingrid Kellenbach at Adelaide Central School of Art |url=https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/national/south-australia/sala-festival-boss-penny-griggs-to-succeed-ingrid-kellenbach-at-adelaide-central-school-of-art/news-story/84ffffb77d3db90c5d35ca7dffbd5c3c |website=The Advertiser (Adelaide) |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Princesse Louise Marie Eugénie Adélaïde-d’Orléans01.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Summer posy by Adélaïde&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Louise Marie ''Adélaïde'' Eugénie d'Orléans''' ([[Paris]], 23 August 1777 – Paris, 31 December 1847) was a French princess, one of the [[twin]] daughters of [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d'Orléans]], known as ''Philippe Égalité'' during the [[French Revolution]], and [[Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon]]. She was titled ''Mademoiselle de Chartres'' at birth, ''Mademoiselle d'Orléans'' at the death of her twin sister in 1782, ''Mademoiselle'' (1783–1812), ''Madame Adélaïde'' (1830). As a member of the reigning [[House of Bourbon]], she was a ''[[Prince du Sang|princesse du sang]]''.

== Biography ==
Adélaïde was raised according to the liberal principles of her governess, [[Stéphanie Félicité du Crest de Saint-Aubin|Madame de Genlis]], principles which also became her own political conviction. She received an excellent but also very hard and strenuous education; to harden herself, she learned to sleep on a hard bed and arise at six every day. She was deeply attached to her governess, and her mother's demand that de Genlis be replaced, though without success, was reportedly a cause of great worry for her. She was considered for marriage to the [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême|Duke of Angoulême]], but the plans were prevented by queen [[Marie Antoinette]]. Later on, she was also considered for marriage to the [[Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry|Duke of Berry]], which did not materialise either.

During the [[French Revolution]], de Genlis on at least one occasion took her to the radical [[Cordelieres Club]]. In 1791, her father asked de Genlis to take her to [[England]] for her safety. The year after, he summoned them back to prevent Adelaide's name from being placed on the list of emigrees. When they arrived, however, de Genlis discovered that Adélaïde was already on the list and that her father, whose political situation had deteriorated, asked her to take Adélaïde out of the country again.

Adelaide received painting lessons from [[Pierre-Joseph Redouté]] and produced some highly-regarded botanical studies as a result. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmitchell.net/Princesse-Louise-Marie-Eugenie-Adelaide-dOrleans-1777-1847-Pansies-Morning-Glories-and-Single-Chrysanthemums-DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=6&amp;tabindex=5&amp;objectid=668553&amp;categoryid=10236|title=Pansies, Morning Glories and Single Chrysanthemums|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life in exile===
In 1792, she left France with de Genlis to the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and then to [[Switzerland]], where she was placed in a convent in Bremgarten. During the Terror her father was guillotined, and her mother was banished to [[Spain]]. Sometime in the spring of 1794, Adélaïde moved to the home of her aunt, the [[Maria Fortunata d'Este|Princess of Conti]]. They moved to Bavaria in 1798 and thereafter to [[Bratislava]], and in 1801, she joined her mother in [[Barcelona]] in Spain. Her relationship with her mother was not good, as she disapproved of her mother's relationship with chancellor de Folmont.

On 25 November 1809, she and her mother attended the wedding of her brother [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] to [[Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily]] in [[Palermo, Sicily|Palermo]] on [[Sicily]]. After the wedding, she did not return with her mother to Spain, but preferred to live with her brother and sister-in-law at Palazzo Orléans in Palermo. She was described as completely devoted to her brother and his family: united with her sister-in-law in their mutual love and concern for him, and a second mother to his children.

===Return to France===
After the fall of Napoleon in 1814, she returned with her brother and his family to Paris and settled with them in [[Palais-Royal]]. During the [[Bourbon Restoration]], Palais-Royal was described as a center of high society social life in the capital, and reportedly, despite the fact that custom dictated that she as an unmarried "spinster" was expected to live in the background, it was she rather than her more reserved sister-in-law who took the role of hostess. 

She was described as firm, intellectual, and frank, and she was a leading force in the family councils of the [[House of Orléans]]. Her loyalty to her brother has been described as due to the fact that, early separated from her family, she was treated with reserve during her exile because of the political actions of her father during the revolution, and her brother was the first person she could lavish her affection upon. Louis Philippe, in turn, relied upon her intelligence and loyalty, made her his confidant and listened to her advice, and consequently, she came to exert great political influence upon him. Being brought up a liberal, she supported the idea of a constitutional monarchy and a representative government. 

She was not on good terms with the reigning Bourbon family; because of their reactionary ideas, and also because the hostility shown by the toward the Orléans line, and to her particularly by [[Marie Thérèse of France]]. Adélaïde rather than her brother are described as the active head of the Orléans fraction, and she had the active desire and ambition to make him monarch. In her apartment at Palais-Royal, she hosted a salon which became the center of liberal opposition toward the regime, and by use of her great personal fortune, she supported the liberal press and various political actors, artists, intellectuals and influential figures to gather support for her brother, among them Talleyrand.

===July Monarchy===
When Louis-Philippe became King of the French in the reign known as the [[July Monarchy]] (1830–1848), she was known as ''Madame Adélaïde''. All her life, she was his loyal advisor or, in 19th century parlance, his "[[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]]". It was she who, reportedly, encouraged him to accept the crown during the [[July revolution]], and her influence continued undisturbed during his reign. When tumult followed the publication of the Ordinances in 1830 and erupted in the July revolution in Paris, the Orléans family was at the country estate Neuilly.  

Adélaïde convinced Louis-Philippe that the moment was right for him to place himself as the leader of the opposition against the [[Absolute monarchy in France|absolute monarchy]] of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], and present himself as the candidate of a [[constitutional monarchy]], in between the unpopular absolute monarchy and the republicanism.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Dyson, C. C: The life of Marie Amélie last queen of the French, 1782–1866. With some account of the principal personages at the courts of Naples and France in her time, and of the careers of her sons and daughters (1910).&lt;/ref&gt; In this, she defeated the view of her sister-in-law Maria Amalia, who was loyal to the reigning older branch. When rumors arrived that the royalists were going to arrest Louis-Philippe, he evacuated to [[Raincy]] and the children were sent to Villiers-Coterets, but Adélaïde and Maria Amalia remained at Neuilly. When a delegation reached Neuilly and offered Louis-Philippe the crown, Maria Amalia refused the offer on behalf of herself and her spouse as an insult, reproaching Scheffer and [[Adolphe Thiers|Thiers]] for insulting them by having made it.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Adélaïde, however, accepted it with the argument that her brother would do anything to prevent the country he loved from anarchy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Thiers accepted the answer of Adélaïde rather than the one from Maria Amalia with the words: "Madame, you have given the crown to your family".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  After this, several other visits followed from people asking Louis-Philippe to accept the crown: to all, Maria Amalia answered that Louis-Philippe was an honest man and thus could not do it, while Adélaïde contradicted her by stating, that the offer should be made to Louis-Philippe by the chamber of deputies; and if he should hesitate, she would herself go to Paris and accept the crown for him.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Soon after, the Chamber of Deputies called Louis-Philippe to Paris to formally present him their offer. It has been estimated that he accepted the crown largely because of Adélaïde.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

At 6 August 1830, she and her sister-in-law were present at the tribune on the ceremony at the chambers in Paris when Louis Philippe was declared King of the French. She and her sister-in-law visited those who had been wounded during the revolution, and supported them financially.   
In October 1830, a mob broke into the Palais-Royal, and repeated attempts were made to execute the ministers of the former regime, which was refused by Louis-Philippe. When marshal [[Étienne Maurice Gérard|Gerard]] remarked that it would be difficult to save them, she replied: "Well Monsieur, then we will all perish in the attempt".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; During his reign, Louis-Philippe visited her daily, discussed the matters of state and family with her, and followed her advice.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Her death was therefore regarded as a great loss not only on an emotional but also a political scale.

Adélaïde d'Orléans died on 31 December 1847, two months before Louis Philippe's abdication on 24 February 1848. She is buried in the Orléans family necropolis in the [[Chapelle royale de Dreux|Royal Chapel of Dreux]].

'''''Agony in the Garden''''' is a small 1524 oil on panel painting of the [[Agony in the Garden]] by [[Correggio]], now at [[Apsley House]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="correggioarthome"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correggioarthome.it/SchedaOpera.jsp?idDocumentoArchivio=2533#|title=Ricerca avanzata|website=Correggio ART HOME|accessdate=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the-athenaeum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-athenaeum.org/art/detail.php?ID=37762|title=The Agony in the Garden - Correggio|website=The Athenaeum|accessdate=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="artuk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-agony-in-the-garden-144127|title=The Agony in the Garden|website=Art UK|accessdate=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Now in a poor state, the painting was admired by [[Vasari]] in [[Reggio Emilia]] - he described it as:
{{quote|a small painting one foot tall, the rarest and most beautiful thing, in which can be seen his small figures and Christ in the garden - the painting is set at night, with the angel appearing and by the light of his splendor illuminating Christ, who is shown so real and so true that it is impossible to imagine him being expressed better. At the foot of the mountain, on level ground, are three sleeping apostles, above whom he shows Christ praying, which gives an impossible strength to the figures; and even more so, in the background, he shows dawn rising and soldiers coming with Judas from one side of the painting: and in such smallness and with such intensity does he show this story, there is no work that is its parallel for patience and hard work.}}
This is supported by [[:File:Bernardino Curti, orazione nell'orto, da Correggio.jpg|a contemporary print of the work by Bernardino Curti]] and a 17th-18th century copy now in the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]].&lt;ref name="nationalgallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/after-correggio-the-agony-in-the-garden|title=After Correggio &amp;#124; The Agony in the Garden &amp;#124; NG76|website=National Gallery, London|accessdate=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was still in Reggio Emilia in the 1580s, in the collection of Rodolfo Signoretti, where it was studied by [[Lelio Orsi]] (who copied from it in ''Christ among the crosses''), [[Titian]], [[Lomazzo]], [[El Greco]] and [[Annibale Carracci]]. A 1582 source reported that "news [of the work had circulated] in Spain and in Rome" and that [[Philip II of Spain]] and [[Alfonso II d'Este]] had both tried in vain to buy it. The Milanese nobleman Pirro Visconti succeeded in buying it around 1587 and brought it to his villa at [[Lainate]] in [[Milan]], where it found favour as part of the deeply religious era of [[St Charles Borromeo]], who kept a copy of it in the room where he died. It was also copied by [[Giulio Campi]] in a painting now in the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]]. From the [[house of Visconti]] it passed to the [[Marquis of Caracena]] before being taken to Spain by the end of the 17th century - there it was admired by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]] before being acquired by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] during the [[Peninsular War]].

{{Arab culture}}
'''Arab culture''' is the culture of the [[Arabs]], from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west to the [[Arabian Sea]] in the east, and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. [[Language]], [[literature]], [[gastronomy]], [[art]], [[architecture]], [[music]], [[spirituality]], [[philosophy]], [[mysticism]] (etc.) are all part of the cultural heritage of the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40043536|title=Beauty in Arabic culture|last=Doris.|first=Behrens-Abouseif,|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers|isbn=1558761993|oclc=40043536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab world is sometimes divided into separate regions including [[Greater Maghreb|Al-Maghrib Al-Arabi]] (consisting of Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania), [[Fertile Crescent]] (consisting of Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Jordan) and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] (consisting of south Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Al Ahwaz Al Arabiya,  Oman and the UAE) and the Arabian Peninsula's Al-Janoub Al-Arabi (consisting of Yemen and Oman).

==Literature==
{{main article|Arabic literature}}
[[Arabic literature]] is the writing produced, both [[prose]] and [[poetry]], by speakers of the [[Arabic language]]. It does not include works written using the [[Arabic alphabet]] but not in the Arabic language such as [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Urdu literature]]. The Arabic word used for literature is ''[[Adab (literature)|adab]]'' which is derived from a word meaning "to invite someone for a meal" and implies politeness, culture and enrichment. Arabic literature emerged in the 6th century, with only fragments of the written language appearing before then. The [[Qur'an]], from the 7th century, had the greatest and longest-lasting effect on Arabic culture and literature. [[Al-Khansa]], a female contemporary of Muhammad, was an acclaimed Arab poet.

[[File:Antarah ibn Shaddad &amp; Abla.jpg|thumb|[[Antarah ibn Shaddad|Antara and Abla]], the Arab [[Romeo and Juliet]]]]

===Mu'allaqat===
{{Main article| Muallaqat}}
The [[Mu'allaqat]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: المعلقات, {{IPA-ar|al-muʕallaqaːt|}}) is the name given to a series of seven Arabic poems or [[qasida]] that originated before the time of Islam. Each poem in the set has a different author, and is considered to be their best work. Mu'allaqat means "The Suspended Odes" or "The Hanging Poems," and comes from the poems being hung on the wall in the Kaaba at Mecca.

The seven authors, who span a period of around 100 years, are [[Imru' al-Qais]], [[Tarafa]], [[Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma|Zuhayr]], [[Labīd]], [['Antara Ibn Shaddad]], [['Amr ibn Kulthum]], and [[Harith ibn Hilliza]]. All of the Mu’allaqats contain stories from the authors’ lives and tribe politics. This is because poetry was used in pre-Islamic time to advertise the strength of a tribe’s king, wealth and people.

The ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' ({{lang-ar|أَلْف لَيْلَة وَلَيْلَة}} ''ʾAlf layla wa-layla''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Arabian Nights|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_0021|edition=3rd|quote=Arabian Nights, the work known in Arabic as ''Alf layla wa-layla''|author=Marzolph, Ulrich|editors=Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;), is a medieval folk tale collection which tells the story of Scheherazade, a Sassanid queen who must relate a series of stories to her malevolent husband, King Shahryar (Šahryār), to delay her execution. The stories are told over a period of one thousand and one nights, and every night she ends the story with a suspenseful situation, forcing the King to keep her alive for another day. The individual stories were created over several centuries, by many people from a number of different lands.

During the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid in the 8th century, Baghdad had become an important cosmopolitan city. Merchants from Persia, China, India, Africa, and Europe were all found in Baghdad. During this time, many of the stories that were originally folk stories are thought to have been collected orally over many years and later compiled into a single book. The compiler and ninth-century translator into Arabic is reputedly the storyteller Abu Abd-Allah Muhammad el-Gahshigar. The frame story of Shahrzad seems to have been added in the 14th century.

==Music==
[[File:Arabischer Maler um 730 002.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fresco]] from [[Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbî]], [[Syria]], [[Ummayad]] [[caliphs]] Palace, built in the early 7th century]]
[[Arabic music]] is the [[music]] of [[Arabs|Arab people]], especially those centered around the Arabian Peninsula. The world of Arab music has long been dominated by [[Cairo]], a cultural center, though musical innovation and regional styles abound from [[Tunisia]] to [[Saudi Arabia]]. [[Beirut]] has, in recent years, also become a major center of Arabic music. [[Classical Arab music]] is extremely popular across the population, especially a small number of superstars known throughout the Arab world. Regional styles of [[popular music]] include Iraqian el Maqaam, [[Algeria]]n ''[[raï]]'', [[Kuwait]]i ''[[sawt (music)|sawt]]'' and [[Egypt]]ian ''[[el gil]]''.

"The common style that developed is usually called 'Islamic' or 'Arab', though in fact it transcends religious, ethnic, geographical, and linguistic boundaries" and it is suggested that it be called the [[Near East]] (from Morocco to India) style ([[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|van der Merwe, Peter]] 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;9).

[[Habib Hassan Touma]] (1996, p.xix-xx) lists "five components" which "characterize the music of the Arabs:
# The [[Arab tone system]] (a [[musical tuning]] system) with specific interval structures, invented by [[al-Farabi]] in the 10th century (p.&amp;nbsp;170).
# [[Rhythmic-temporal structures]] that produce a rich variety of [[rhythm]]ic patterns, ''[[Rhythm in Arabian music|awzan]]'', used to accompany the metered vocal and instrumental genres and give them form.
# [[Musical instrument]]s that are found throughout the Arabian world and that represent a standardized [[tone system]], are played with standardized performance techniques, and exhibit similar details in construction and design.
# Specific social contexts for the making of music, whereby [[Music genre|musical genres]] can be classified as urban (music of the city inhabitants), rural (music of the country inhabitants), or [[Bedouin]] (music of the desert inhabitants).
# A musical mentality that is responsible for the aesthetic homogeneity of the tonal-spatial and rhythmic-temporal structures in Arabian music, whether [[musical composition|composed]] or [[improvise]]d, [[instrumental]] or [[vocal]], [[secular]] or [[sacred]]. The Arab's musical mentality is defined by:
## The maqām phenomenon.
## The predominance of vocal music.
## The predilection for small instrumental ensembles.
## The mosaiclike stringing together of musical form elements, that is, the arrangement in a sequence of small and smallest melodic elements, and their repetition, combination, and permutation within the framework of the tonal-spatial model.
## The absence of polyphony, polyrhythm, and motivic development. Arabian music is, however, very familiar with the ostinato, as well as with a more instinctive heterophonic way of making music.
## The alternation between a free rhythmic-temporal and fixed tonal-spatial organization on the one hand and a fixed rhythmic-temporal and free tonal-spatial structure on the other. This alternation... results in exciting contrasts."

Much Arab music is characterized by an emphasis on [[melody]] and [[rhythm]] rather than [[harmony]]. Thus much Arabic music is [[homophony|homophonic]] in nature. Some genres of Arab music are [[polyphonic]]—as the instrument [[Kanun (instrument)|Kanoun]] is based upon the idea of playing two-note [[chord (music)|chords]]—but quintessentially, Arabic music is melodic.

It would be incorrect though to call it [[Musical mode|modal]], for the Arabic system is more complex than that of the [[Greece|Greek]] modes. The basis of the Arabic music is the [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] (pl. maqamat), which looks like the mode, but is not quite the same. The maqam has a "[[tonality|tonal]]" note on which the piece must end (unless modulation occurs).

[[File:Riqq.jpg|thumb|left|The [[riq]] is widely used in Arabic music]]

The maqam consists of at least two jins, or scale segments. "Jins" in Arabic comes from the ancient Greek word "genus," meaning type. In practice, a jins (pl. ajnas) is either a [[trichord]], a [[tetrachord]], or a [[pentachord]]. The trichord is three notes, the tetrachord four, and the pentachord five. The maqam usually covers only one [[octave]] (two jins), but sometimes it covers more than one octave. Like the [[Minor scale|melodic minor]] scale and Indian ragas, some maqamat have different ajnas, and thus notes, while descending or ascending. Because of the continuous innovation of jins and because most music scholars don't agree on the existing number anyway, it's hard to give an accurate number of the jins. Nonetheless, in practice most musicians would agree on the 8 most frequently used ajnas: Rast, Bayat, Sikah, Hijaz, Saba, Kurd, Nahawand, and Ajam — and a few of the most commonly used variants of those: Nakriz, Athar Kurd, Sikah Beladi, Saba Zamzama. Mukhalif is a rare jins used exclusively in Iraq, and it does not occur in combination with other ajnas.

The main difference between the western [[chromatic scale]] and the Arabic scales is the existence of many in-between notes, which are sometimes referred to as [[quarter tone]]s for the sake of practicality. However, while in some treatments of theory the quarter tone scale or all twenty four tones should exist, according to [[Yusuf Shawqi|Yūsuf Shawqī]] (1969) in practice there are many fewer tones (Touma 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;170).

In fact, the situation is much more complicated than that. In 1932, at International Convention on Arabic music held in Cairo, Egypt (attended by such Western luminaries as [[Béla Bartók]] and [[Henry George Farmer]]), experiments were done which determined conclusively that the notes in actual use differ substantially from an even-tempered 24-tone scale, and furthermore that the intonation of many of those notes differ slightly from region to region (Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Iraq). The commission's recommendation is as follows: "The tempered scale and the natural scale should be rejected. In Egypt, the Egyptian scale is to be kept with the values, which were measured with all possible precision. The Turkish, Syrian, and Iraqi scales should remain what they are..." (translated in Maalouf 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;220). Both in modern practice, and based on the evidence from recorded music over the course of the last century, there are several differently tuned "E"s in between the E-flat and E-natural of the Western Chromatic scale, depending on the maqam or jins in use, and depending on the region.

Musicians and teachers refer to these in-between notes as "quarter-tones" ("half-flat" or "half-sharp") for ease of nomenclature, but perform and teach the exact values of intonation in each jins or maqam by ear. It should also be added, in reference to Touma's comment above, that these "quarter-tones" are not used everywhere in the maqamat: in practice, Arabic music does not modulate to 12 different tonic areas like the [[Well-Tempered Klavier]], and so the most commonly used "quarter tones" are on E (between E-flat and E-natural), A, B, D, F (between F-natural and F-sharp) and C.

The prototypical Arab ensemble in Egypt and Syria is known as the [[Takht (music)|takht]], which includes, (or included at different time periods) instruments such as the [['oud]], [[qanun (instrument)|qanún]], [[rabab]], nay, [[violin]] (which was introduced in the 1840s or 50s), [[riq]] and [[goblet drum|dumbek]]. In Iraq, the traditional ensemble, known as the chalghi, includes only two melodic instruments—the jowza (similar to the rabab but with four strings) and [[Santoor (Persian instrument)|santur]]—with [[riq]] and [[dumbek]].

[[File:Arabiya Reporter.jpg|thumb|right|An anchor on [[Al-Arabiya]] Television, in Jerusalem]]

Prior to the Islamic Era, [[poetry]] was regarded as the main means of communication on the [[Arabian Peninsula]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} It related the achievements of tribes and defeats of enemies and also served as a tool for [[propaganda]]. After the arrival of [[Islam]] other forms of communication replaced poetry as the primary form of communication. [[Imams]] (preachers) played a role in disseminating information and relating news from the authorities to the people. The suq or marketplace gossip and interpersonal relationships played an important role in the spreading of news, and this form of communication among [[Arabs]] continues today. Before the introduction of the [[printing press]] [[Muslims]] obtained most of their news from the imams at the [[mosque]], friends or in the marketplace. [[Colonial powers]] and [[Christian Missionaries]] in [[Lebanon]] were responsible for the introduction of the printing press. It was not until the 19th century that the first newspapers began to appear, mainly in [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]], which had the most newspapers per capita.

During [[France|French]] rule in [[Egypt]] in the time of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] the first newspaper was published, in French. There is debate over when the first Arabic language newspaper was published; according to Arab scholar Abu Bakr, it was ''Al Tanbeeh'' (1800), published in Egypt, or it was ''Junral Al Iraq'' (1816), published in [[Iraq]], according to other researchers. In the mid-19th century the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish Empire]] dominated the first newspapers. In the [[Northern Africa]]n countries of [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]] the French colonial power built a press link between mainland countries.

The first newspapers were limited to official content and included accounts of relations with other countries and civil trials. In the following decades Arab media blossomed due to [[journalist]]s mainly from Syria and Lebanon, who were intellectuals and published their newspapers without the intention of making a profit. Because of the restrictions by most governments, these intellectuals were forced to flee their respective countries but had gained a following and because of their popularity in this field of work other intellectuals began to take interest in the field.
The first émigré Arab newspaper, ''Mar’at al Ahwal'', was published in Turkey in 1855 by Rizqallah Hassoun Al Halabi. It was criticized by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and shut down after only one year. Intellectuals in the [[Arab world]] soon realized the power of the press. Some countries' newspapers were government-run and had political agendas in mind. Independent newspapers began to spring up which expressed opinions and were a place for the public to out their views on the state. Illiteracy rates in the Arab world played a role in the formation of media, and due to the low reader rates newspapers were forced to get political parties to subsidize their publications, giving them input to editorial policy.

Freedoms that have branched through the introduction of the Internet in [[Middle East]] are creating a stir politically, culturally, and socially. There is an increasing divide between the generations. The Arab world is in conflict internally. The internet has brought economic prosperity and development, but [[blog]]gers have been incarcerated all around in the Middle East for their opinions and views on their regimes, the same consequence which was once given to those who publicly expressed themselves without anonymity. But the power of the internet has provided also a public shield for these bloggers since they have the ability to engage public sympathy on such a large scale. This is creating a dilemma that shakes the foundation of Arab culture, government, religious interpretation, economic prosperity, and personal integrity.

Each country or region in the Arab world has varying colloquial languages which are used for everyday speech, yet its presence in the media world is discouraged. Prior to the establishment of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA), during the 19th century, the language of the media was stylized and resembled literary language of the time, proving to be ineffective in relaying information. Currently MSA is used by Arab media, including newspapers, books and some television stations, in addition to all formal writing. Vernaculars are however present in certain forms of media including satires, dramas, music videos and other local programs.

Journalism ethics is a system of values that determines what constitutes "good" and "bad" journalism.&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hafez|first=Kai|title=Arab Media: Power and Weakness|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|pages=147–64|authorlink=The Unknown Desire for "Objectivity": Journalism Ethics in Arab (and Western) Journalism|editor=Kai Hafez}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A system of media values consists of and is constructed by journalists'  and other actors'  decisions about issues like what is "newsworthy," how to frame the news, and whether to observe topical "red lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Itule|first=Bruce|title=News Writing and Reporting for Today's Media|date=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|author2=Douglas Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a system of values varies over space and time, and is embedded within the existing social, political, and economic structures in a society. William Rugh states, "There is an intimate, organic relationship between media institutions and society in the way that those institutions are organized and controlled. Neither the institution nor the society in which it functions can be understood properly without reference to the other. This is certainly true in the Arab world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Media values in the Arab world therefore vary between and within countries. In the words of Lawrence Pintak and Jeremy Ginges, “The Arab media are not a monolith.”&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pintak|first=Lawrence|author2=Jeremy Ginges|title=The Mission of Arab Journalism: Creating Change in a Time of Turmoil|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|date=2008|volume=13|issue=3|page=219|doi=10.1177/1940161208317142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists in the Arab world hold many of the same values with their news generation as do journalists in the [[Western world]]. Journalists in the Arab world often aspire to Western norms of objectivity, impartiality, and balance. Kuldip Roy Rampal's study of journalist training programs in North Africa leads him to the conclusion that, "the most compelling dilemma faced by professional journalists, increasingly graduates of journalism degree programs, in the four Maghreb states is how to reconcile their preference for press freedom and objectivity with constraints imposed by political and legal factors that point to a pro-government journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rampal|first=Kuldip Roy|title=Professionals in Search of Professionalism: Journalists' Dilemma in Four Maghreb States|journal=International Communication Gazette|date=1996|volume=58|issue=1|pages=25–43|doi=10.1177/001654929605800102}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Iyotika Ramaprasad and Naila Nabil Hamdy state, “A new trend toward objectivity and impartiality as a value in Arab journalism seems to be emerging, and the values of Arab and Western journalism in this field have started to converge.”&lt;ref name="Function"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramaprasad|first=Jyotika|author2=Naila Nabil Hamdy|title=Functions of Egyptian Journalists: Perceived Importance and Actual Importance|journal=International Communication Gazette|date=2006|volume=68|issue=2|pages=167–85|doi=10.1177/1748048506062233}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Further, many journalists in the Arab world express their desires for the media to become a fourth estate akin to the media in the West. In a survey of 601 journalists in the Arab world, 40% of them viewed investigation of the government as part of their job.&lt;ref name=Mission /&gt;

Important differences between journalists in the Arab world and their Western counterparts are also apparent.  Some journalists in the Arab world see no conflict between objectivity and support for political causes.&lt;ref name="Inside Arab Newsroom"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pintak|first=Lawrence|author2=Jeremy Ginges|title=Inside the Arab Newsroom|journal=Journalism Studies|date=2009|volume=10|issue=2|page=173|doi=10.1080/14616700802337800}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Ramprasad and Hamdy’s sample of 112 Egyptian journalists gave the highest importance to supporting [[Pan-Arabism|Arabism]] and Arab values, which included injunctions such as “defend Islamic societies, traditions and values” and “support the cause of the Palestinians.” Sustaining democracy through “examining government policies and decisions critically,” ranked a close second.&lt;ref name=Function /&gt;  This view is further endorsed in Kirat’s survey where 65 percent of Algerian journalists agreed that the task for the press is to "help achieve the goals and objectives of development plans.&lt;ref&gt;Kirat, Mohamed. "The Algerian News People: A Study of Their Backgrounds, Professional Orientations and Working Conditions". Diss. Indiana University, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such an approach to media fits within the larger scope of  [[development communication]] and journalism. The extent to which professional and political aims conflict is a subject of study for scholars of the Arab world's media.

Other journalists reject the notion of media ethics altogether because they see it as a mechanism of control. Kai Hafez states, “Many governments in the Arab world have tried to hijack the issue of media ethics and have used it as yet another controlling device, with the result that many Arab journalists, while they love to speak about the challenges of their profession, hate performing under the label of media ethics.”&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness" /&gt;

Historically, news in the Arab world was used to inform, guide, and publicize the actions of political practitioners rather than being just a consumer product. The power of news as political tool was discovered in the early 19th century, with the purchase of shares from Le Temps a French newspaper by Ismail the grandson of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]. Doing so allowed Ismail to publicize his policies.&lt;ref name=Ayalon&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayalon|first=Ami|title=The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History|date=1995|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab Media coming to modernity flourished and with it its responsibilities to the political figures that have governed its role. Ami Ayalon argues in his history of the press in the Arab Middle East that, “Private journalism began as an enterprise with very modest objectives, seeking not to defy authority but rather to serve it, to collaborate and coexist cordially with it. The demand for freedom of expression, as well as for individual political freedom, a true challenge to the existing order, came only later, and hesitantly at that, and was met by a public response that can best be described as faint." &lt;ref name=Ayalon /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Media researchers stress that the moral and social responsibility of newspeople dictates that they should not agitate public opinion, but rather should keep the status quo. It is also important to preserve national unity by not stirring up ethnic or religious conflict.&lt;ref name="Mellor, Noha 2005"&gt;Mellor, Noha. The Making of Arab News. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The values of media in the Arab world have started to change with the emergence of “new media." Examples of new media include news websites, blogs, and satellite television stations like [[Al Arabiya]]. The founding of the Qatari [[Al Jazeera]] network in 1996 especially affected media values. Some scholars believe that the network has blurred the line between private- and state- run news. Mohamed Zayani and Sofiane Sabraoui state, “Al Jazeera is owned by the government, but has an independent editorial policy; it is publicly funded, but independent minded.”&lt;ref name="Culture of Al Jazeera"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zayani|first=Mohamed|title=The Culture of Al Jazeera: Inside an Arab Media Giant|date=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, NC|author2=Sofiane Sahroui}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Al Jazeera media network espouses a clear mission and strategy, and was one of the first news organizations in the Arab world to release a code of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;"Code of Ethics." Al Jazeera English. Al Jazeera Media Network, 07 Nov. 2010. Web. 02 Mar. 2014. http://www.aljazeera.com/aboutus/2006/11/2008525185733692771.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its government ties, it seeks to “give no priority to commercial or political over professional consideration” and to “cooperate with Arab and international journalistic unions and associations to defend freedom of the press.” With a motto of “the view and the other view,” it purports to “present the diverse points of view and opinions without bias and partiality.” It has sought to fuse these ostensibly Western media norms with a wider “Arab orientation,” evocative of the social responsibility discussed by scholars such as Noha Mellor above.

Some more recent assessments of Al Jazeera have [[Al Jazeera controversies and criticism|criticized]] it for a lack of credibility in the wake of the Arab Spring. Criticism has come from within the Arab Middle East, including from state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunham|first=Jillian|title=Syrian TV Station Accuses Al Jazeera of Fabricating Uprising|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/syrian-tv-station-accuses-al-jazeera-of-fabricating-uprising/|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent commentators have criticized its neutrality vis-a-vis the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Peter|title=In Syria, al Jazeera’s Credibility Implodes|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/03/05/in-syria-al-jazeeras-credibility-implodes/|publisher=CounterPunch|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media values are not the only variable that affects news output in Arab society. Hafez states, “The interaction of political, economic, and social environments with individual and collective professional ethics is the driving force behind journalism.”&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness" /&gt; In most Arab countries, newspapers cannot be published without a government-issued license. Most Arab countries also have press laws, which impose boundaries on what can and cannot be said in print.

Censorship plays a significant role in journalism in the Arab world. Censorship comes in a variety of forms: [[Self-censorship]], Government [[Censorship]] (governments struggle to control through technological advances in ex. the internet), [[Ideology]]/Religious Censorship, and Tribal/Family/Alliances Censorship. Because [[Journalism]] in the Arab world comes with a range of dangers – journalists throughout the Arab world can be imprisoned, tortured, and even killed in their line of work – self-censorship is extremely important for many Arab journalists. A study conducted by the Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) in Jordan, for example, found that the majority of Jordanian journalists exercise self-censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hazaimeh |first=Hani |title=Majority of Jordanian Journalists Exercise Self-censorship - Survey |url=http://jordantimes.com/majority-of-jordanian-journalists-exercise-self-censorship----survey |publisher=The Jordan Times |accessdate=22 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708083856/http://jordantimes.com/majority-of-jordanian-journalists-exercise-self-censorship----survey |archivedate=8 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Committee to Protect Journalists|CPJ]] found that 34 journalists were killed in the region in 2012, 72 were imprisoned on December 1, 2012, and 126 were in exile from 2007 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attacks on the Press: Journalism on the Front Lines in 2012|url=http://cpj.org/2013/02/attacks-on-the-press-in-2012-mideast.php|publisher=Committee for the Protection of Journalists|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related point is that media owners and patrons have effects on the values of their outlets. Newspapers in the Arab world can be divided into three categories: government owned, [[partisan (military)|partisan]] owned, and independently owned. Newspaper, radio, and television patronization in the Arab world has heretofore been primarily a function of governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;   "Now, newspaper ownership has been consolidated in the hands of powerful chains and groups. Yet, [[profit (economics)|profit]] is not the driving force behind the launching of newspapers; [[publishers]] may establish a newspaper to ensure a platform for their political opinions, although it is claimed that this doesn’t necessarily influence the news content".&lt;ref&gt;Pintak, Lawrence. "Arab Media: Not Quite Utopia"&lt;/ref&gt; In the Arab world, as far as content is concerned, news is politics. Arab states are intimately involved in the economic well-being of many Arab news organizations so they apply pressure in several ways, most notably through ownership or advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Justin D. |url=http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/article/102479/Investigative-Journalism-in-the-Arab-World.aspx |title=Nieman Reports &amp;#124; Investigative Journalism in the Arab World |publisher=Nieman.harvard.edu |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts hold that cultural and societal pressures determine journalists' news output in the Arab world. For example, to the extent that family reputation and personal reputation are fundamental principles in Arab civilization, exposes of corruption, examples of weak moral fiber in governors and policy makers, and [[investigative journalism]] may have massive consequences. In fact, some journalists and media trainers in the Arab world nevertheless actively promote the centrality of investigative journalism to the media’s larger [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]] function. In Jordan, for example, where the degree of government and security service interference in the media is high, non-governmental organizations such as the Center for Defending the Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) and Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ) train journalists to undertake investigative journalism projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pies|first=Judith|title=Arab Media: Power and Weakness|date=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|pages=165–81|chapter=Agents of Change? Journalism Ethics in Lebanese and Jordanian Journalism Education.|editor=Kai Hafez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jordan Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists sign.JPG|thumb|The Jordanian Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) posted this sign in protest of the country's 2012 Press and Publications law. It reads, "The right to obtain information is a right for all people".]]

Some Saudi journalists stress the importance of enhancing Islam through the media. The developmental role of media was acknowledged by an overwhelming majority of Saudi journalists, while giving the readers what they want was not regarded as a priority.&lt;ref&gt;Tash, Abdulkader. A Profile of Professional Journalists Working in the Saudi Arabian Daily Press. Diss. Southern Illinois University, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, journalism codes, as an important source for the study of media values, complicate this notion. Kai Hafez states, “The possible hypothesis that Islamic countries might not be interested in ‘truth’ and would rather propagate ‘Islam’ as the single truth cannot be verified completely because even a code that limits journalists’ freedom of expression to Islamic objectives and values, the Saudi Arabian code, demands that journalists present real facts.”&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness" /&gt; In addition, [[Media of Saudi Arabia|Saudi journalists]] operate in an environment in which anti-religious talk is likely to be met with censorship.

Patterns of consumption also affect media values. People in the Arab world rely on newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and the Internet to differing degrees and to meet a variety of ends. For Rugh, the proportion of radio and television receivers to Arab populations relative to UNESCO minimum standards suggests that radio and television are the most widely consumed media. He estimates that television reaches well over 100 million people in the region, and this number has likely grown since 2004. By contrast, he supposes that Arab newspapers are designed more for elite-consumption on the basis of their low circulation. He states, "Only five Arab countries have daily newspapers which distribute over 60,000 copies and some have dailies only in the under-10,000 range. Only Egypt has dailies which distribute more than a half million copies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimating newspaper readership is complicated, however, by the fact that single newspapers can change hands many times in a day. Finally, the internet continues to be a fairly common denominator in Arab societies. A report by the Dubai School of Government and Bayt.com estimates that there are more than 125 million Internet users in the region, and that more than 53 million of them actively use social media. They caution, however, that while "the internet has wide-ranging benefits, these benefits do not reach large segments of societies in the Arab region. The digital divide remains a significant barrier for many people. In many parts of the Arab world levels of educational attainment, economic activity, standards of living and internet costs still determine a person's access to life-changing technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arab World Online: Trends in Internet Usage in the Arab Region|url=http://img.b8cdn.com/images/uploads/article_docs/dsg-gip_bayt_report_final_16822_EN.pdf|publisher=The Dubai School of Government with Bayt.com|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, according to Leo Gher and Hussein Amin, the Internet and other modern telecommunication services may serve to counter the effects of private and public ownership and patronage of the press. They state, "Modern international telecommunications services now assist in the free flow of information, and neither inter-Arab conflicts nor differences among groups will affect the direct exchange of services provided by global cyberspace networks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gher|first=Leo A.|author2=Hussein Y. Amin|title=New and Old Media Access and Ownership in the Arab World|journal=International Communications Gazette|date=1999|volume=61|series=1|pages=59–88|doi=10.1177/0016549299061001004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magazines ===
In most Arab countries, [[magazines]] cannot be published without a government-issued license. Magazines in the Arab world, like many of the magazines in the Western world, are geared towards women. However, the number of magazines in the Arab world is significantly smaller than that of the Western world. The Arab world is not as advertisement driven as the Western world. Advertisers fuel the funding for most Western magazines to exist. Thus, a lesser emphasis on [[advertisement]] in the Arab world plays into the low number of magazines.

=== Radio ===
There are 90 private radio stations throughout [[the Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. ([http://www.newarabia.net/arabic_radio_stations.php list of private radio stations in the Arab world])

Arab radio broadcasting began in the 1920s, but only a few Arab countries had their own broadcasting stations before [[World War II]]. After 1945, most Arab states began to create their own radio broadcasting systems, although it was not until 1970, when [[Oman]] opened its radio transmissions, that every one of them had its own radio station.

Among Arab countries, [[Egypt]] has been a leader in radio broadcasting from the beginning. Broadcasting began in Egypt in the 1920s with private commercial radio. In 1947, however, the Egyptian government declared radio a government monopoly and began investing in its expansion.

By the 1970s, Egyptian radio had fourteen different broadcast services with a total air time of 1,200 hours per week. Egypt is ranked third in the world among radio broadcasters. The programs were all government controlled, and much of the motivation for the government's investment in radio was due to the aspirations of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] to be the recognized leader of the Arab world.

Egypt's "Voice of the Arabs" station, which targeted other Arab countries with a constant stream of news and political features and commentaries, became the most widely heard station in the region. Only after the [[June 1967 war]], when it was revealed that this station had misinformed the public about what was happening, did it lose some credibility; nevertheless it retained a large listenership.

On the [[Arabian Peninsula]], radio was slower to develop. In [[Saudi Arabia]], radio broadcasts started in the [[Jidda]]-[[Mecca]] area in 1948, but they did not start in the central or eastern provinces until the 1960s. Neighboring [[Bahrain]] had radio by 1955, but [[Qatar]], [[Abu Dhabi]], and [[Oman]] did not start indigenous radio broadcasting until nearly a quarter century later.

===Television===
Almost all television channels in the Arab world were [[government]]-owned and strictly controlled prior to the 1990s. In the 1990s the spread of satellite television began changing television in Arab countries. Often noted as a pioneer, [[al-Jazeera]] represents a shift towards a more professional approach to news and current affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-bab.com/media/television.htm |title=Arab media: television |publisher=Al-bab.com |accessdate=2011-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505045604/http://www.al-bab.com/media/television.htm |archivedate=2011-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Financed by the [[Qatar]] government and established in 1996, [[al-Jazeera]] was the first Arabic channel to deliver extensive live news coverage, going so far as to send reporters to "unthinkable" places like Israel. Breaking the mold in more ways than one, al-Jazeera’s discussion programs raised subjects that had long been prohibited. However, in 2008, [[Egypt]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] called for a meeting to approve a charter to regulate [[satellite]] [[broadcasting]]. The [[Arab League]] Satellite Broadcasting Charter (2008) lays out principles for regulating satellite broadcasting in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;Arab Media &amp; Society (March, 2008):[http://www.arabmediasociety.com/articles/downloads/20080314081327_AMS_Charter_English.pdf Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter (Unofficial Translation)] Retrieved 6 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arab Media &amp; Society (March, 2008): [http://www.arabmediasociety.com/UserFiles/AMS%20Charter%20Arabic.pdf Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter (in Arabic)] Retrieved 6 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Other satellite channels:

* [[Al-Arabiya]]: established in 2003; based in Dubai; offshoot of MBC
* [[Al-Hurra]] ("The Free One"): established in 2004 by the United States; counter perceives "biases" in Arab news media
* Al-Manar: owned by Hizbullah; Lebanese-based; highly controversial

"Across the [[Middle East]], new [[television stations]], [[radio stations]] and [[websites]] are sprouting like incongruous electronic mushrooms in what was once a media desert. Meanwhile [[newspapers]] are aggressively probing the red lines that have long contained them".&lt;ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007"&gt;Pintak, Lawrence. Reporting a Revolution: the Changing Arab Media Landscape. Arab Media &amp; Society (February, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Technology]] is playing a significant role in the changing Arab media. Pintak furthers, "Now, there are 263 free-to-air (FTA) satellite television stations in the region, according to Arab Advisors Group. That’s double the figure as of just two years ago".&lt;ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007"/&gt; [[Freedom of speech]] and money have little to do with why [[satellite television]] is sprouting up everywhere. Instead, "A desire for political influence is probably the biggest factor driving channel growth. But ego is a close second".&lt;ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007"/&gt; The influence of the West is very apparent in Arab media, especially in television. [[Arab soap operas]] and the emerging popularity of [[reality TV]] are evidence of this notion.

"In the wake of controversy triggered by ''Super Star'' and ''Star Academy'', some observers have hailed reality television as a harbinger of democracy in the Arab world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kraidy |first=Marwan |url=http://www.arabmediasociety.com/topics/index.php?t_article=85 |title=Arab Media &amp; Society |publisher=Arabmediasociety.com |accessdate=2011-04-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110405121157/http://www.arabmediasociety.com/topics/index.php?t_article=85| archivedate= 5 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Star Academy]]'' in [[Lebanon]] is strikingly similar to ''[[American Idol]]'' mixed with ''[[The Real World]]''. ''Star Academy'' began in 2003 in the Arab world. "Reality television entered Arab public discourse in the last five years at a time of significant turmoil in the region: escalating violence in [[Iraq]], contested elections in Egypt, the struggle for women’s political rights in [[Kuwait]], [[political assassination]]s in [[Lebanon]], and the protracted [[Arab-Israeli Conflict]]. This geo-political crisis environment that currently frames Arab politics and Arab-Western relations is the backdrop to the controversy surrounding the social and political impact of Arab reality television, which assumes religious, cultural or moral manifestations."&lt;ref&gt;Kraidy, Marwan M. Reality Television and Politics in the Arab World: Preliminary Observations. Transnational Broadcasting Studies, 15 (Fall/ Winter, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cinema ===
{{main article|Arab cinema}}
Most Arab countries did not produce films before nation independence. In [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]], production is even now confined to short films or television. [[Bahrain]] witnessed the production of its first and only full-length feature film in 1989. In [[Jordan]] national production has barely exceeded half a dozen feature films. [[Algeria]] and [[Iraq]] have produced approximately 100 films each, [[Morocco]] around seventy, [[Tunisia]] around 130, and [[Syria]] some 150. [[Lebanon]], owing to an increased production during the 1950s and 1960s, has made some 180 feature films. Only [[Egypt]] has far exceeded these countries, with a production of more than 2,500 feature films (all meant for cinema, not television).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Shafik, Viola. Arab Cinema: History and Cultural Identity.&lt;/ref&gt; As with most aspects of [[Arab media]], censorship plays a large art of creating and distributing films. "In most Arab countries, film projects must first pass a state committee, which grants or denies permission to shoot. Once this permission is obtained, another official license, a so-called visa, is necessary in order to exploit the film commercially. This is normally approved by a committee of the Ministry of Information or a special censorship authority".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The most significant taboo topics under state supervision are consistent with those of other forms of media: [[religion]], [[sex]], and [[politics]].

=== Internet ===
The [[Internet]] in the Arab world is powerful source of expression and information as it is in other places in the world. While some believe that it is the harbinger of freedom in media to the [[Middle East]], others think that it is a new medium for [[censorship]]. Both are true. The Internet has created a new arena for discussion and the dissemination of information for the Arab world just as it has in the rest of the world. The youth in particular are accessing and utilizing the tools. People are encouraged and enabled to join in political discussion and critique in a manner that was not previously possible. Those same people are also discouraged and blocked from those debates as the differing regimes try to restrict access based on religious and state objections to certain material.

This was posted on a website operated by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The internet in the Arab world has a snowball effect; now that the snowball is rolling, it can no longer be stopped. Getting bigger and stronger, it is bound to crush down all obstacles. In addition, to the stress caused by the Arab bloggers, a new forum was opened for Arab activists; Facebook. Arab activists have been using Facebook in the utmost creative way to support the democracy movement in the region, a region that has one of the highest rates of repression in the world. Unlike other regions where oppressive countries (like China, Iran and Burma) represent the exception, oppression can be found everywhere in the Arab world. The number of Arab internet users interested in political affairs does not exceed a few thousands, mainly represented by internet activists and bloggers, out of 58 million internet users in the Arab world. As few as they are, they have succeeded in shedding some light on the corruption and repression of the Arab governments and dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;How the Internet has snowballed in the Arab world. &lt;http://www.ikhwanweb.com/print.php?id=22470&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929043556/http://www.ikhwanweb.com/print.php?id=22470 |date=September 29, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public Internet use began in the US in the 1980s. Internet access began in the early 1990s in the Arab world, with [[Tunisia]] being first in 1991 according to Dr. Deborah L. Wheeler. The years of the Internet's introduction in the various Arab countries are reported differently. Wheeler reports that [[Kuwait]] joined in 1992, and in 1993, [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]] and the [[UAE]] came online. In 1994 [[Jordan]] joined the Internet, and [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Syria]] followed in the late 1990s. Financial considerations and the lack of widespread availability of services are factors in the slower growth in the Arab world, but taking into consideration the popularity of [[internet cafe]]s, the numbers [[online]] are much larger than the subscription numbers would reveal.&lt;ref&gt;Hofheinz, Albrecht. "The Internet in the Arab World: Playground for Political Liberalization." (n.d.): 96&lt;/ref&gt;

The people most commonly utilizing the Internet in the Arab world are youths. The [[café]] users in particular tend to be under 30, single and have a variety of levels of [[education]] and language proficiency. Despite reports that use of the internet was curtailed by lack of [[English language|English]] skills, Dr. Wheeler found that people were able to search with [[Arabic]]. Searching for jobs, the unemployed frequently fill cafes in [[Egypt]] and [[Jordan]]. They are [[men]] and [[women]] equally. Most of them chat and they have email. In a survey conducted by Dr. Deborah Wheeler, she found them to almost all to have been taught to use the Internet by a friend or family member. They all felt their lives to have been significantly changed by the use of the Internet. The use of the Internet in the Arab world is very political in the nature of the posts and of the sites read and visited. The Internet has brought a medium to Arabs that allows for a [[free will|freedom]] of expression not allowed or accepted before. For those who can get online, there are blogs to read and write and access to worldwide outlets of information once unobtainable. With this access, regimes have attempted to curtail what people are able to read, but the Internet is a medium not as easily manipulated as telling a [[newspaper]] what it can or cannot [[publish]]. The Internet can be reached via [[proxy server]], mirror, and other means. Those who are thwarted with one method will find 12 more methods around the blocked site. As [[journalists]] suffer and are imprisoned in traditional media, the Internet is no different with [[bloggers]] regularly being imprisoned for expressing their views for the world to read. The difference is that there is a worldwide audience witnessing this crackdown and watching as [[laws]] are created and recreated to attempt to control the vastness of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Rinnawi, Khalil. "The Internet and the Arab world as a virtual public shpere." (n.d.): 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jihadists]] are using the Internet to reach a greater audience. Just as a simple citizen can now have a worldwide voice, so can a movement. Groups are using the Internet to share video, photos, programs and any kind of information imaginable. Standard media may not report what the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] would say on their site. However, for the interested, the Internet is a tool that is utilized with great skill by those who wish to be heard. A file uploaded to 100 sites and placed in multiple forums will reach millions instantly. Information on the Internet can be thwarted, slowed, even redirected, but it cannot be stopped if someone wants it out there on the Internet.

The efforts by the various regimes to control the information are all falling apart gradually. Those fighting crime online have devised methods of tracking and catching criminals. Unfortunately those same tools are being used to arrest bloggers and those who would just wish to be heard. The Internet is a vast and seemingly endless source of information. Arabs are using it more than perhaps the world is aware and it is changing the media.

==Society==
[[File:Cairo Cafe.JPG|thumb|right|A café in [[Cairo]]]]
Social loyalty is of great importance in Arab culture. Family is one of the most important aspects of the Arab society. While self-reliance, individuality, and responsibility are taught by Arabic parents to their children, family loyalty is the greatest lesson taught in Arab families.  "Unlike the extreme individualism we see in North America (every person for him or herself, individual rights, families living on their own away from relatives, and so on), Arab society emphasizes the importance of the group. Arab culture teaches that the needs of the group are more important than the needs of one person."&lt;ref&gt;J. Esherick, Women in the Arab World (Philadelphia: Mason Crest Publishers, 2006), 68&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bedouin tribes of Saudi Arabia, "intense feelings of loyalty and dependence are fostered and preserved"&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Gannon, Understanding Global Culture: Metaphorical Journeys Through 28 Nations, 3rd Edition, (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2004), 70&lt;/ref&gt; by the family.&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Samovar, et al., Communication Between Cultures, 7th Ed., (Boston: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 2010), 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Margaret Nydell, in her book ''Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times'', writes "family loyalty and obligations take precedence over loyalty to friends or demands of a job."&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"&gt;M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times, 4th Ed., (Boston: Intercultural Press, 2006), 71&lt;/ref&gt;  She goes on to state that "members of a family are expected to support each other in disputes with outsiders. Regardless of personal antipathy among relatives, they must defend each other’s honor, counter criticism, and display group cohesion..."&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt;  Of all members of the family, however, the most revered member is the mother.

Family honor is one of the most important characteristics in the Arab family. According to Margaret Nydell, social exchanges between men and women happen very seldom outside of the work place.&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt; Men and women refrain from being alone together. They have to be very careful in social situations because those interactions can be interpreted negatively and cause gossip, which can tarnish the reputation of women. Women are able to socialize freely with other women and male family members, but have to have family members present to socialize with men that are not part of the family.&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt; These conservative practices are put into place to protect the reputation of women. Bad behavior not only affects women but her family’s honor. Practices differ between countries and families. Saudi Arabia has stricter practices when it comes to men and women and will even require marriage documents if a woman and man are seen together alone.&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt;

'''Arab values'''
One of the characteristics of Arabs is generosity and they usually show it by being courteous with each other. Some of the most important values for Arabs are honor and loyalty. Margaret Nydell, in her book ''Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times' &lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt;  '' says that Arabs can be defined as, humanitarian, loyal and polite. Tarek Mahfouz explains in the book "Arab Culture" &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mahfouz, Tarek. Arab Culture, Vol. 1: An In-depth Look at Arab Culture Through Cartoons and Popular Art (English and Arabic Edition). Ed. Thane Floreth. 2011 ed. Vol. 1. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; that it is common for Arabs in dinner situations to insist on guests to eat the last piece of the meal or to fight over who will pay the bill at a restaurant for generosity.''

'''Female Infanticide''' 
Like many societies around the world, the preference for a son is much higher than that for a daughter in the Arab world. In pre-Islamic Arabia, husbands would go as far as burying female infants alive because of the shame it caused them among their peers. Women are typically seen as a burden whereas men represent honor and dignity to a family. Muhammad revealed a verse which deals with this phenomenon. It says, "And God will ask the female infant who had been buried alive (''"mau'udda"'') for what wrongdoing was she killed."&lt;ref&gt;[https://quran.com/81/8-9 Surah At-Takwir]&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is long gone in the Arab world, but the sentiment of having a son over a daughter still resides and women are still subject to divorce for failure to give birth to a son as a first born child.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Sports==

===Pan Arab Games===
{{Main article|Pan Arab Games}}
The Pan Arab Games are a regional multi-sport event held between nations from the Arab world. The first Games were held in 1953 in Alexandria, Egypt. Intended to be held every four years since, political turmoil as well as financial difficulties has made the event an unstable one. Women were first allowed to compete in 1985. By the [[2007 Pan Arab Games|11th Pan Arab Games]], the number of countries participating reached all 22 members of the [[Arab League]], with roughly over 8,000 Arab athletes participating, it was considered the largest in the Games History, with the [[2011 Pan Arab Games|Doha Games]] in 2011 expected to exceed that number.

===Arab women in sports===
Women around the world have struggled in the professional world of sports since it has been something that has been dominated by men. When looking at the Arab world currently there is an emergence of Arab women playing sports, something that for the most part is not much discussed but is of great importance. Muslim Arab women are taking part in playing on futsal, football (soccer), softball, basketball, and various other teams. Some women are participating in boxing, archery, running, swimming, tennis and other individual sports. Because more Muslim women are playing sports, sportswear is being developed so that a woman can still be able to participate in sports like swimming without limiting their participation due to the way they choose to dress. Although women have received great support from family members in playing sports, there is still much criticism towards female athletes in the Arab world. Many conservative men have criticized that sports and women do not go together and that a woman would not be able to wear her headscarf or should not wear shorts while playing sports.

Some people do not see Islam and women playing sports as being compatible. Despite the various criticisms Arab women around the Arab world face, it has not stopped the popularity of women’s participation in sports. Football is one of the sports that has exploded in popularity with women in the Arab world. With the coming of the Women’s World Cup in 2011, there is a Women’s Football Cup Arabia occurring in Bahrain which is bringing together women’s teams from all over the Arab world to play in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muslimwomeninsports.blogspot.com/2010/10/womens-football-cup-arabia-2010-on-road.html |title=Muslim Women in SPORTS: WOMEN'S FOOTBALL CUP ARABIA 2010 - on the road to Germany |publisher=Muslimwomeninsports.blogspot.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are teams in Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Libya and Jordan and events like this show that, as said by Dr. Sahar al Hawary who is a member of FIFA’s Women’s Committee from Egypt, "women's football can be promoted at the highest level and watched in the Arab world... women's football can be promoted at the highest level and watched in the Arab world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/news/newsid=90760.html |title=Princess champions game for Arab women |publisher=FIFA.com |date=2004-02-11 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab women are also challenging and becoming a part of sports that even outside of the Arab world are considered not for women. There are Arab women who are participating in boxing, even reaching international competition levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cY2p8fjX1s |title=Everywoman - Sport and playing for gold - 30 May 08 - Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab women are not limiting themselves and although they receive criticism from some of society, their families and communities have been very supportive while still considering themselves conservative and faithful to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2jYLCloFo&amp;feature=channel |title=Everywoman - Sport and playing for gold - 30 May 08 - Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women and their families are challenging the very narrow view that society at times has of the capabilities of women and have inspired women all around the Arab world to not limit themselves. Despite this occurring in the Arab world, what these Arab female athletes are doing is an inspiration to women all over the globe.

==Cuisine==
{{Main article|Arab cuisine}}
[[File:Petra metzes.jpg|thumb|200px|A selection of Jordanian [[Meze|mezze]], appetizers or small dishes, in [[Petra]], [[Jordan]].]]
Originally, the Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula relied heavily on a diet of [[date palm|dates]], wheat, barley, rice and meat, with little variety, with a heavy emphasis on yoghurt products, such as [[leben (food)|leben]] (لبن) (yoghurt without butterfat). Arabian cuisine today is the result of a combination of richly diverse cuisines, spanning the Arab world and incorporating [[Levantine cuisine|Levantine]], Egyptian, and others. It has also been influenced to a degree by the cuisines of India, Turkey, Berber, and others. In an average Arab household in the [[Persian Gulf]] area, a visitor might expect a dinner consisting of a very large platter, shared commonly, with a vast mountain of rice, incorporating lamb or chicken, or both, as separate dishes, with various stewed vegetables, heavily spiced, sometimes with a tomato sauce. Most likely, there would be several other items on the side, less hearty. [[Tea]] would certainly accompany the meal, as it is almost constantly consumed. [[Coffee]] would be included as well.

===Tea culture===
{{further|Arabic tea}}
Tea is a very important drink in the Arab world, it is usually served with breakfast, after lunch, and with dinner. For Arabs tea is a hospitality drink that is served to guests. It is also common for Arabs to drink tea with dates.

== Dress ==

===Men===
Arab dress for men ranges from the traditional flowing robes to blue jeans, T-shirts and business suits. The robes allow for maximum circulation of air around the body to help keep it cool, and the head dress provides protection from the sun. At times, Arabs mix the traditional garb with clothes.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/arabculture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thobe'''
In the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] men usually wear their national dress that is called "thobe" but can be also called "Dishdasha" (Kuwait) or "Kandoura" (UAE). "Thobes" differ slightly from state to state within the Gulf, but the basic ones are white. This is the traditional attire that Arabs wear in formal occasions.

'''Headdress'''
The male headdress is also known as [[Keffiyeh]]. Headdress pattern might be an indicator of which tribe, clan, or family the wearer comes from. However, this is not always the case. While in one village, a tribe or clan might have a unique headdress, in the next town over an unrelated tribe or clan might wear the same headdress.
[[File:Jissr-groom.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A wedding carriage in [[Jisr az-Zarqa]], Israel]]
* Checkered headdresses relate to type and government and participation in the [[Hajj]], or a pilgrimage to Mecca.
* Red and white checkered headdress – Generally of Jordanian origin. Wearer has made Hajj and comes from a country with a Monarch.
* Black and white checkered headdress – The pattern is historically of Palestinian origin.
* Black and grey represent Presidential rule and completion of the Hajj.

'''Guthra (headdress) in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]'''
The male headdress in the Gulf states is called Guthra and it is different in each country (size and shape). It is usually worn with a black cord called "agal" that keeps the guthra on the wearer's head.
* The Qatari guthra is heavily starched and it is known for its "cobra" shape.
* The Saudi guthra is a square shaped cotton fabric. The traditional is white but the white and red (shemagh) is also very common in Saudi Arabia.
* The Emirati guthra is usually white and can be used as a wrapped turban or traditionally with the black agal.

===Women===
Adherence to traditional dress varies across Arab societies. [[Saudi Arabia]] is more traditional, while [[Egypt]] is less so. Traditional Arab dress features the full length body cover ([[abaya]], [[jilbāb]], or [[chador]]) and veil ([[hijab]]). Women are only required to wear ''[[abaya]]s'' in Saudi Arabia. In most countries, like [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Egypt]], the veil is not prevalent.

'''''Art Attack''''' is a British [[children's television series]] revolving around [[art]], currently hosted by [[Lloyd Warbey]] on [[Disney Junior]], and originally airing on [[CITV]] hosted by [[Neil Buchanan]] from 1990 to 2007.

The original series aired on [[CITV]] between 15 June 1990 and 26 May 2007, and was presented by one of its creators, [[Neil Buchanan]], throughout. Buchanan also wrote and produced the series, and came up with a majority of the creative ideas. 

A new series launched on [[Disney Junior (UK &amp; Ireland)]] on 6 June 2011 and was presented by [[Jassa Ahluwalia]]. Each show involved Ahluwalia voicing-over footage of an artist producing three works of art, taking the viewer through the various stages of production step by step. Ahluwalia was later replaced with Lloyd Warbey at the start of the British second revived series.

==History==
The programme was originally a [[Television South|TVS]] production, devised by two TVS employees, Neil Buchanan and Tim Edmunds. Buchanan and Edmunds met each other at Southern Television in 1978, and worked together on ''[[No. 73]]'' and ''Do It!''.

The first Art Attacks were a strand within No. 73, and this segment proved so popular, [[Nigel Pickard]] the executive producer of children's programming at TVS green lit the pilot. The Art Attack [[television pilot|pilot]] was shot on location at a disused swimming pool in [[Gillingham, Kent]] in 1989, and the series began the following year.

When TVS lost its [[Media franchise|franchise]], Edmunds and Buchanan bought the rights to the show and produced ''Art Attack'' through their company, [[The Media Merchants]]. The Media Merchants used [[STV Productions]] (then known as "SMG Productions"), as the ITV company to get the series onto the network: this was partly down to the fact that Nigel Pickard had moved to [[Scottish Television]]. In 1993 another ex-TVS employee, Peter Urie set up a production management company, Television Support Services. Television Support Services managed all of the Media Merchants productions.

For the vast majority of its run, the show was filmed at [[The Maidstone Studios]], [[Maidstone, Kent]]. In 1998, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] bought the rights to produce foreign-language versions of Art Attack. Each version had a different local host for each territory, and was made in Maidstone, on a similar set to the original version. Neil Buchanan's Big Art Attacks were retained in the international shows, as was The Head, who was dubbed by relevant local voice artists. Buchanan also produced the artwork for the foreign versions - footage of his hands creating the pieces would be voiced over by the local host, who would show the artwork in-between stages and explain what to do next.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent-business/county-news/neils-hands-are-a-media-export-a2898/|title=Neil's hands are a media export|last=|first=|date=2002-03-28|website=Kent Business|publisher=KM Group|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney ended production of the foreign shows in 2005.

ITV announced the cancellation of the series in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= ''Art Attack'' axed after 18 years |url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/programming/a65632/art-attack-axed-after-18-years.html |last=Oatts |first=Joanne |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date= 13 July 2007 |accessdate=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until January 2014, the show was regularly repeated on [[CITV]], usually on weekend afternoons. After the programme's demise, many of the production team transferred to ''[[Finger Tips]]'' and ''[[Mister Maker]]'', both recorded at The Maidstone Studios.

In 2010, Disney announced a new version of the series would air on [[Disney Junior]] around the world. Production was moved to Disney's studios in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. Once again, several versions were made for each market; these were produced in a similar manner to the previous international versions. The first series of the new UK version was presented by [[Jassa Ahluwalia]]. Local artist Alexiev Gandman was brought in to create the Big Art Attacks.

In December 2012, Buchanan was featured in a segment dedicated to the programme's original run in the one-off documentary special ''30 Years of CITV'': a 1992 episode was broadcast on the CITV channel shortly after the above was broadcast, as part of its Old Skool Weekend marathon.

==Characters==

===The Head===
'''The Head''', was a puppet stone bust who would humorously recap the steps needed to produce the last art piece made. After doing this, he would usually show his creation of the previous Art Attack, most times however getting it hilariously wrong and usually bursting into tears. However, on occasion, by accidentally doing part of the instructions incorrectly, he would create a different effect to that desired and be proud of his work. He would sometimes tell jokes after the Big Art Attacks. In series one, 'The Head' was played by [[Jim Sweeney (comedian)|Jim Sweeney]], in series 2, [[Andrew O'Connor (actor)|Andrew O'Connor]]; and from series 3, having been redesigned as a puppet, he was voiced and operated by [[Francis Wright (puppeteer)|Francis Wright]]. 'The Head' did not appear in series 12 or 13, or in series 18 and 19.

===Vincent Van Coconut===
In the revived series, The Head was replaced by a talking [[palm tree]] called '''Vincent Van Coconut''', voiced by Tim Hibber. His name, Vincent van Coconut, is a parody of the famous Painter painter [[Vincent Van Gogh]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5422">There are a few differing '''Buddhist views on sin'''.

[[ethnology|Ethnologist]] [[Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf]] explained,
{{quote|In Buddhist thinking the whole universe, men as well as gods, are subject to a reign of law. Every action, good or bad, has an inevitable and automatic effect in a long chain of causes, an effect which is independent of the will of any deity. Even though this may leave no room for the concept of 'sin' in the sense of an act of defiance against the authority of a personal god, Buddhists speak of 'sin' when referring to transgressions against the universal moral code. (1974: 550)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=von Fürer-Haimendorf|first=Christoph|year=1974|title=The Sense of Sin in Cross-Cultural Perspective|journal = Man|volume = New Series 9.4|pages=539–556}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

American [[Zen]] author [[Brad Warner]] states that in Buddhism there is no concept of sin at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Warner| first =Brad| authorlink =Brad Warner| title =[[Hardcore Zen|Hardcore Zen: Punk Rock, Monster Movies &amp; the Truth About Reality]]| publisher =Wisdom Publications| year =2003| pages =144| isbn = 0-86171-380-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Warner| first =Brad| authorlink =Brad Warner|  title =[[Sex, Sin, and Zen |Sex, Sin, and Zen: A Buddhist Exploration of Sex from Celibacy to Polyamory and Everything in Between]]| publisher =New World Library| year =2010| pages =72| isbn = 978-1-57731-910-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha Dharma Education Association also expressly states "The idea of sin or original sin has no place in Buddhism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhism: Major Differences|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/snapshot01.htm|publisher=Buddha Dharma Education Association|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zen student and author Barbara O'Brien has said that "Buddhism has no concept of sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's Forgive Brit Hume|url=http://buddhism.about.com/b/2010/01/04/lets-forgive-brit-hume.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sins and Buddhism|url=http://buddhism.about.com/b/2010/01/08/sins-and-buddhism.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chögyam Trungpa]] specifically disagreed with the notion of "[[original sin]]"&lt;ref name="trungpa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Goodness or Original Sin?|url=http://www.lionsroar.com/basic-goodness-or-original-sin/|publisher=[[Lion's Roar (magazine)|Lion's Roar]]|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying

{{quote|The problem with this notion of original sin or mistake is that it acts very much as a hinderance {{sic}} to people. At some point it is of course necessary to realize one’s shortcomings. But if one goes too far with that, it kills any inspiration and can destroy one’s vision as well. So in that way, it really is not helpful, and in fact it seems unnecessary.&lt;ref name="trungpa"/&gt;}}

[[Walpola Rahula]] also disagreed with the notion of sin saying "In fact there is no 'sin' in Buddhism, as sin is understood in some religions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rahula|first=Walpola|authorlink=Walpola Rahula|title=[[What the Buddha Taught]]|publisher=Grove Press|year=1974|page=1|isbn=978-0802130310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anantarika-karma==
{{main|Anantarika-karma}}

Anantarika-karma in [[Theravada Buddhism]] is a heinous crime, which through [[karma|karmic process]] brings immediate disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Work of Culture: Symbolic Transformation in Psychoanalysis and Anthropology |author= Gananath Obeyesekere|year=1990|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-nLv_IiMTA4C&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305|isbn=978-0-226-61599-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269825 The Buddha's Bad Karma: A Problem in the History of Theravada Buddhism]  Jonathan S. Walters, Numen, Vol. 37, No. 1 (June, 1990), pp. 70-95&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mahayana Buddhism]] these five crimes are referred to as pañcānantarya (Pāli), and are mentioned in ''The Sutra Preached by the Buddha on the Total Extinction of the Dharma'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3lHag-M0quUC&amp;pg=PA128|title= A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms: With Sanskrit and English Equivalents and a Sanskrit-Pali Index|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1995|ISBN=978-0700703555|page=128|authorlink1=Lewis Hodous|last1=Hodous|first1=Lewis|authorlink2=William Edward Soothill|last2=Soothill|first2=William Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered so heinous that a Buddhist or a non Buddhist should avoid them. According to Buddhism committing such a crime would prevent him or her attaining the stages of [[Sotapanna]], [[Sakadagami]], [[Anagami]] or [[Arhat]] in that lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9gm9CzNd5EC&amp;pg=PA285|title=Ways of Thinking of Eastern Peoples: India, China, Tibet, Japan|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|page=285|authorlink=Hajime Nakamura|last1=Nakamura|first1=Hajime|year=1991|ISBN=978-8120807648}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five crimes or sins are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rām Garg|first=Gaṅgā|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=433|year=1992|ISBN=9788170223757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They reached their apogee in the period 1150–1250.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 242"&gt;Hasenohr, 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Composed in verse, these narrative poems of moderate length (averaging 4000 lines&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;) were originally sung, or (later) recited, by [[minstrels]] or jongleurs.  More than one hundred ''chansons de geste'' have survived in around three hundred manuscripts&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 12"&gt;''La Chanson de Roland,'' 12.&lt;/ref&gt; that date from the 12th to the 15th  century.

==Origins==
Since the 19th century, much critical debate has centered on the origins of the ''chansons de geste'', and particularly on explaining the length of time between the composition of the ''chansons'' and the actual historical events which they reference.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 239"&gt;Hasenohr, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;  The historical events the ''chansons'' allude to occur in the eighth through tenth centuries, yet the earliest ''chansons'' we have were probably composed at the end of the eleventh century: only three ''chansons de geste'' have a composition that incontestably dates from before 1150: the ''[[Chanson de Guillaume]]'', ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' and ''[[Gormont et Isembart]]'':&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 239"/&gt; the first half of the ''Chanson de Guillaume'' may date from as early as the eleventh century;&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr, 520–522.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, 102–104.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gormont et Isembart'' may date from as early as 1068, according to one expert;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Song of Roland'' probably dates from after 1086&lt;ref&gt;''La Chanson de Roland'', 10.&lt;/ref&gt; to c.1100.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 239"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr, 1300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three early theories of the origin of ''chansons de geste'' believe in the continued existence of epic material (either as lyric poems, epic poems or prose narrations) in these intervening two or three centuries.&lt;ref name="Holmes, 68"&gt;Holmes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics like [[Claude Charles Fauriel]], [[François Raynouard]] and German Romanticists like [[Jacob Grimm]] posited the spontaneous creation of lyric poems by the people as a whole at the time of the historic battles, which were later put together to form the epics.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the basis for the "cantilena" theory of epic origin, which was elaborated by [[Gaston Paris]], although he maintained that single authors, rather than the multitude, were responsible for the songs.&lt;ref name="Holmes, 67"&gt;Holmes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory was also supported by Robert Fawtier and by [[Léon Gautier]] (although Gautier thought the ''cantilenae'' were composed in Germanic languages).&lt;ref name="Holmes, 67"/&gt;  At the end of the nineteenth century, Pio Rajna, seeing similarities between the ''chansons de geste'' and old Germanic/Merovingian tales, posited a Germanic origin for the French poems.&lt;ref name="Holmes, 67"/&gt;  A different theory, introduced by the medievalist [[Paul Meyer (philologist)|Paul Meyer]], suggested the poems were based on old prose narrations of the original events.&lt;ref name="Holmes, 68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="see also Hasenohr, 239"&gt;see also Hasenohr, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory (largely discredited today&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 11"&gt;''La Chanson de Roland'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt;), developed by [[Joseph Bédier]], posited that the early ''chansons'' were recent creations, not earlier than the year 1000, developed by singers who, emulating the songs of "saints lives" sung in front of churches (and collaborating with the church clerics&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 11"/&gt;), created epic stories based on the heroes whose shrines and tombs dotted the great [[pilgrimage]] routes, as a way of drawing pilgrims to these churches.&lt;ref name="Holmes, 68-9"&gt;Holmes, 68-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics have also suggested that knowledge by clerics of ancient Latin epics may have played a role in their composition.&lt;ref name="see also Hasenohr, 239"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes, 68-9"/&gt;

Subsequent criticism has vacillated between "traditionalists" (''chansons'' created as part of a popular tradition) and "individualists" (''chansons'' created by a unique author),&lt;ref name="see also Hasenohr, 239"/&gt; but more recent historical research has done much to fill in gaps in the literary record and complicate the question of origins.  Critics have discovered manuscripts, texts and other traces of the legendary heroes, and further explored the continued existence of a Latin literary tradition (c.f. the scholarship of [[Ernst Robert Curtius]]) in the intervening centuries.&lt;ref&gt;see also Hasenohr, 240.&lt;/ref&gt;  The work of Jean Rychner on the art of the minstrels&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 11"/&gt; and the work of [[Milman Parry|Parry]] and [[Albert Bates Lord|Lord]] on Yugoslavian oral traditional poetry, Homeric verse and [[Oral-Formulaic Composition|oral composition]] have also been suggested to shed light on the ''oral'' composition of the ''chansons'', although this view is not without its critics&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 240"&gt;Hasenohr, 240.&lt;/ref&gt; who maintain the importance of ''writing'' not only in the preservation of the texts, but also in their composition, especially for the more sophisticated poems.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 240"/&gt;

==Subject matter and structure==
Composed in [[Old French]] and apparently intended for oral performance by [[minstrel|jongleurs]], the ''chansons de geste'' narrate legendary incidents (sometimes based on real events) in the history of [[France]] during the eighth, ninth and tenth centuries, the age of [[Charles Martel]], [[Charlemagne]] and [[Louis the Pious]], with emphasis on their conflicts with the [[Moors]] and [[Saracen]]s, and also disputes between kings and their vassals.

The traditional subject matter of the ''chansons de geste'' became known as the [[Matter of France]]. This distinguished them from [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] concerned with the [[Matter of Britain]], that is, [[King Arthur]] and his [[knight]]s; and with the so-called [[Matter of Rome]], covering the [[Trojan War]], the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], the life of [[Julius Caesar|Julius Cæsar]] and some of his [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] successors, who were given medieval makeovers as exemplars of [[chivalry]].&lt;ref&gt;This three-way classification of [[mythology]] is set out by the twelfth-century poet [[Jean Bodel]] in the ''[[Chanson de Saisnes]]'': for details see [[Matter of France]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A key theme of the ''chansons de geste'', which set them off from the romances (which tended to explore the role of the "individual"), is their critique and celebration of community/collectivity (their epic heroes are portrayed as figures in the destiny of the nation and Christianity)&lt;ref&gt;''La Chanson de Roland'', 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; and their representation of the complexities of feudal relations and service.

The subject matter of the ''chansons'' evolved over time, according to public taste.  Alongside the great battles and scenes of historic prowess of the early ''chansons'' there began to appear other themes.  Realistic elements (money, urban scenes) and elements from the new court culture (female characters, the role of love) began to appear.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 242"/&gt;  Other [[fantasy]] and adventure elements, derived from the romances, were gradually added:&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 242"/&gt; [[giant (mythology)|giants]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[monster]]s increasingly appear among the foes along with [[Islam|Muslims]].  There is also an increasing dose of Eastern adventure, drawing on contemporary experiences in the [[Crusades]]; in addition, one series of ''chansons'' retells the events of the [[First Crusade]] and the first years of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].  The conflicts of the 14th century ([[Hundred Years' War]]) brought a renewed epic spirit and nationalistic (or propagandistic&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr, 242&lt;/ref&gt;) fervor to some ''chansons de geste'' (such as ''La Chanson de [[Hugues Capet]]'').&lt;ref name="Adam, 45"&gt;Adam, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poems contain an assortment of [[fictional character|character types]]; the repertoire of valiant hero, brave traitor, shifty or cowardly traitor, [[Saracen]] giant, beautiful Saracen princess, and so forth.  As the genre matured, fantasy elements were introduced.  Some of the characters that were devised by the poets in this manner include the [[fairy]] [[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]], who made his literary debut in ''[[Huon de Bordeaux]]''; and the magic [[horse]] [[Bayard (legend)|Bayard]], who first appears in ''[[Renaud de Montauban]]''. Quite soon an element of self-[[parody]] appears; even the august Charlemagne was not above gentle mockery in the ''[[Pèlerinage de Charlemagne]]''.

The [[narrative structure]] of the ''chanson de geste'' has been compared to the one in the [[Nibelungenlied]] and in [[creole language|creole]] [[legend]]s by [[Henri Wittmann]]&lt;ref&gt;Wittmann, Henri. 1995. "La structure de base de la syntaxe narrative dans les contes et légendes du créole haïtien." ''Poétiques et imaginaires: francopolyphonie littéraire des Amériques''. Edited by Pierre Laurette &amp; Hans-George Ruprecht. Paris: L'Harmattan, pp. 207–218.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1995b-narr.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of common [[narreme]] structure as first developed in the work of [[Eugene Dorfman]]&lt;ref&gt;Dorfman,  Eugène.  1969.  ''The narreme in the medieval romance epic:  An introduction to narrative structures''.  Toronto:  University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean-Pierre Tusseau]]&lt;ref&gt;*Tusseau, Jean-Pierre &amp; Henri Wittmann.  1975.  "Règles de narration dans les chansons de geste et le roman courtois".  ''Folia linguistica'' 7.401-12.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1975e-narremesOF.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versification==
Early ''chansons de geste'' were typically composed in [[decasyllable|ten-syllable]] lines grouped in [[assonance]]d (meaning that the last stressed vowel is the same in each line throughout the stanza, but the last consonant differs from line to line) [[stanza]]s (called ''[[laisse]]s''). These stanzas are of variable length.

An example from the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'' illustrates the technique of the ten-syllable assonanced form. The assonance in this stanza is on '''e''':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|fr|Desuz un pin, delez un eglanter
Un faldestoed i unt, fait tout d'or mer:
La siet li reis ki dulce France tient.
Blanche ad la barbe et tut flurit le chef,
Gent ad le cors et le cuntenant fier.
S'est kil demandet, ne l'estoet enseigner.}}
|
Under a pine tree, by a rosebush,
there is a throne made entirely of gold.
There sits the king who rules sweet France;
his beard is white, with a full head of hair.
He is noble in carriage, and proud of bearing.
If anyone is looking for the King, he doesn't need to be pointed out.}}

Later ''chansons'' were composed in monorhyme stanzas, in which the last syllable of each line rhymes fully throughout the stanza.  Later ''chansons'' also tended to be composed using [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]]s (twelve-syllable) lines, instead of ten-syllable lines (some early ''chansons'', such as ''[[Girart de Vienne]]'', were even adapted into a twelve-syllable version).

The following example of the twelve-syllable rhymed form is from the opening lines of ''[[Les Chétifs]]'', a ''chanson'' in the [[Crusade cycle]]. The rhyme is on '''ie''':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|fr|Or s'en fuit Corbarans tos les plains de Surie,
N'enmaine que .ii. rois ens en sa conpaignie.
S'enporte Brohadas, fis Soudan de Persie;
En l'estor l'avoit mort a l'espee forbie
Li bons dus Godefrois a le chiere hardie
Tres devant Anthioce ens en la prairie.}}
|
So Corbaran escaped across the plains of Syria;
He took only two kings in his company.
He carried away Brohadas, son of the Sultan of Persia,
Who had been killed in the battle by the clean sword
Of the brave-spirited good duke Godfrey
Right in front of Antioch, down in the meadow.}}

These forms of versification were substantially different than the forms found in the Old French verse [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] (''romans'') which were written in [[octosyllable|octosyllabic]] [[rhyme]]d [[couplet]]s.

==Composition and performance==
The public of the ''chansons de geste''—the lay (secular) public of the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries—was largely [[literacy|illiterate]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''La Chanson de Roland'', 12.&lt;/ref&gt; except for (at least to the end of the 12th century) members of the great courts and (in the south) smaller noble families.&lt;ref&gt;Bumke, 429.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the ''chansons'' were primarily an oral medium.

Opinions vary greatly on whether the early ''chansons'' were first written down and then read from manuscripts (although [[parchment]] was quite expensive&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 14"&gt;''La Chanson de Roland'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;)  or memorized for performance,&lt;ref name="Bumke, 521-2"&gt;Bumke, 521-2.&lt;/ref&gt; or whether portions were improvised,&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 14"/&gt; or whether they were entirely the product of spontaneous [[Oral-Formulaic Composition|oral composition]] and later written down.  Similarly, scholars differ greatly on the social condition and literacy of the poets themselves; were they cultured [[cleric]]s or illiterate jongleurs working within an oral tradition?  As an indication of the role played by orality in the tradition of the ''chanson de geste'', lines and sometimes whole stanzas, especially in the earlier examples, are noticeably [[Oral poetry|formulaic]] in nature, making it possible both for the poet to construct a poem in performance and for the audience to grasp a new theme with ease.

Scholarly opinions differ on the exact manner of recitation, but it is generally believed that the ''chansons de geste'' were originally sung (whereas the medieval romances were probably spoken)&lt;ref name="Bumke, 521-2"/&gt; by poets, [[minstrel]]s or jongleurs, who would sometimes accompany themselves, or be accompanied, on the ''[[vielle]]'', a mediæval [[fiddle]] played with a bow. Several manuscript texts include lines in which the jongleur demands attention, threatens to stop singing, promises to continue the next day, and asks for money or gifts.&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 14"/&gt;  By the middle of the 13th century, singing had probably given way to recitation.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 242"/&gt;

It has been calculated that a reciter could sing about a thousand verses an hour&lt;ref name="Bumke, 522"&gt;Bumke, 522.&lt;/ref&gt; and probably limited himself to 1000–1300 verses by performance,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; making it likely that the performance of works extended over several days.&lt;ref name="Bumke, 522"/&gt; Given that many ''chansons'' from the late twelfth century on extended to over 10,000 verses or more (for example, ''[[Aspremont (chanson de geste)|Aspremont]]'' comprises 11,376 verses, while ''[[Quatre Fils Aymon]]'' comprises 18,489 verses), it is conceivable that few spectators heard the longest works in their entirety.&lt;ref&gt;see Bumke, 522.&lt;/ref&gt;

While poems like ''The Song of Roland'' were sometimes heard in public squares and were no doubt warmly received by a broad public,&lt;ref&gt;Brault, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; some critics caution that the ''chansons'' should probably not be characterized as popular literature&lt;ref&gt;Brault, 353 (note 166).&lt;/ref&gt; and some ''chansons'' appear particularly tailored for an audience of aristocratic, privileged or warrior classes.&lt;ref&gt;see Brault, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The poems themselves==
More than one hundred ''chansons de geste'' have survived in around three hundred manuscripts&lt;ref name="La Chanson de Roland, 12"/&gt; that date from the 12th to the 15th  century.  Several popular ''chansons'' were written down more than once in varying forms. The earliest ''chansons'' are all (more or less) anonymous; many later ones have named authors.

By the middle of the 12th century, the corpus of works was being expanded principally by "cyclisation", that is to say by the formation of "cycles" of ''chansons'' attached to a character or group of characters—with new ''chansons'' being added to the ensemble by singing of the earlier or later adventures of the hero, of their youthful exploits ("enfances"), the great deeds of their ancestors or descendants, or their retreat from the world to a convent ("moniage") – or attached to an event (like the Crusades).&lt;ref&gt;Adam, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1215 [[Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube]], in the introductory lines to his ''Girart de Vienne'', subdivided the Matter of France, the usual subject area of the ''chansons de geste'', into three [[literature cycle|cycle]]s, which revolved around three main characters (see quotation at [[Matter of France]]). There are several other less formal lists of ''chansons'', or of the legends they incorporate. One can be found in the [[fabliau]] entitled ''Des Deux Bordeors Ribauz'', a humorous tale of the second half of the 13th century, in which a jongleur lists the stories he knows.&lt;ref&gt;''Recueil général et complet des fabliaux'' ed. A. de Montaiglon (1872) vol. 1 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Another is included by the Catalan troubadour [[Guiraut de Cabrera]] in his humorous poem ''[[Ensenhamen]]'', better known from its first words as ''"Cabra juglar"'': this is addressed to a ''juglar'' (jongleur) and purports to instruct him on the poems he ought to know but doesn't.&lt;ref&gt;Martín de Riquer, Los cantares de gesta franceses (1952) pp. 390–404&lt;/ref&gt;

The listing below is arranged according to Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube's cycles, extended with two additional groupings and with a final list of ''chansons'' that fit into no cycle. There are numerous differences of opinion about the categorization of individual ''chansons''.

===''Geste du roi''===

The ''chansons de geste'' reached their apogee in the period 1150–1250.&lt;ref name="Hasenohr, 242"/&gt; By the middle of the 13th century, public taste in France had begun to abandon these epics, preferring, rather, the romances.&lt;ref name="Adam, 38"&gt;Adam, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the genre progressed in the middle of the 13th century, only certain traits (like versification, ''laisse'' structure, formulaic forms, setting, and other clichés of the genre) remained to set the ''chansons'' apart from the romances.&lt;ref name="Adam, 38"/&gt;  The 15th century saw the cycles of ''chansons'' (along with other chronicles) converted into large prose compilations (such as the compilation made by [[David Aubert]]).&lt;ref name="Adam, 45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haseonohr, 243"&gt;Haseonohr, 243.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, the themes of the epics continued to exert an influence through the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Haseonohr, 243"/&gt;

==Legacy and adaptations==
The ''chansons de geste'' created a body of [[mythology]] that lived on well after they ceased to be produced in France.

The French ''chanson'' gave rise to the [[Old Spanish]] tradition of the ''[[cantar de gesta]]''.

The ''chanson de geste'' was also adapted in southern ([[Occitan language|Occitan-speaking]]) France.  One of the three surviving manuscripts of the ''chanson'' [[Girart de Roussillon]] (12th century) is in Occitan,&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr, 547.&lt;/ref&gt; as are two works based on the story of Charlemagne and Roland, ''[[Rollan a Saragossa]]''&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr, 1305.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Ronsasvals]]'' (early 12th century).&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr, 1320.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''chanson de geste'' form was also used in such Occitan texts as ''[[Canso d'Antioca]]'' (late 12th century), ''[[Daurel e Betó]]'' (first half of the 13th century), and ''[[Song of the Albigensian Crusade]]'' (c.1275) (cf [[Occitan literature]]).

In medieval Germany, the ''chansons de geste'' elicited little interest from the German courtly audience, unlike the romances which were much appreciated.  While ''The Song of Roland'' was among the first French epics to be translated into German (by [[Konrad der Pfaffe]] as the ''[[Rolandslied]]'', c.1170), and the German poet [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] based his (incomplete) 13th century epic ''Willehalm'' (consisting of seventy-eight manuscripts) on the ''[[Aliscans]]'', a work in the cycle of [[William of Gellone|William of Orange]] (Eschenbach's work had a great success in Germany), these remained isolated examples.  Other than a few other works translated from the cycle of Charlemagne in the 13th century, the ''chansons de geste'' were not adapted into German, and it is believed that this was because the epic poems lacked what the romances specialized in portraying: scenes of idealized knighthood, love and courtly society.&lt;ref&gt;Bumke, 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 13th century, certain French ''chansons de geste'' were adapted into the [[Old Norse]] ''[[Karlamagnús saga]]''.

In Italy, there exist several 14th-century texts in verse or prose which recount the feats of Charlemagne in Spain, including a ''chanson de geste'' in Franco-Venetian, the ''[[Entrée d'Espagne]]'' (c.1320)&lt;ref&gt;Hasenohr. Article: "Entrée d'Espagne", pp. 412–3.&lt;/ref&gt; (notable for transforming the character of Roland into a [[knight errant]], similar to heroes from the Arthurian romances&lt;ref&gt;Brand, 168.&lt;/ref&gt;), and a similar Italian epic ''[[La Spagna]]'' (1350–1360) in [[ottava rima]].  Through such works, the "Matter of France" became an important source of material (albeit significantly transformed) in Italian romantic epics.  ''[[Morgante]]'' (c.1483) by [[Luigi Pulci]], ''[[Orlando innamorato]]'' (1495) by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]], ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' (1516) by [[Ludovico Ariosto]], and ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'' (1581) by [[Torquato Tasso]] are all indebted to the French narrative material (the Pulci, Boiardo and Ariosto poems are founded on the legends of the paladins of Charlemagne, and particularly, of Roland, translated as "Orlando").

The incidents and plot devices of the Italian epics later became central to works of English literature such as [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''; Spenser attempted to adapt the form devised to tell the tale of the triumph of [[Christianity]] over [[Islam]] to tell instead of the triumph of [[Protestantism]] over [[Roman Catholicism]].

The Welsh poet, painter, soldier and engraver [[David Jones (artist-poet)|David Jones]]'s Modernist poem [[In Parenthesis]] was described by contemporary critic [[Herbert Read]] as having "the heroic ring which we associate with the old chansons de geste".

On August 25, 1934, the Executive Council (The Council of Ministers at the time) issued Directive No. 558 declaring the '''Coat of Arms of [[Jordan]]''' ({{lang-ar|'''شعار المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية'''}}), (which was designed in 1921 upon the request of His Highness Emir [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah I]]) as the official emblem of the country and outlining its specific design layout. On February 21, 1982, the Council of Ministers issued the official Notification No. 6, which gave written specifications and explanations of the official emblem of the country. The following description is:

The Royal Hashemite Crown represents the monarchy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and is composed of five arches with beaded design, fanning out from beneath its pinnacle and attached to the base with a relief design recalling rubies and emeralds. On top of the base rest five lotus flowers, denoting purity. The Royal Hashemite Crown is adorned at the top by the tip of a spear that represents the Hashemite banner. The Royal Hashemite Crown rests on the sash that represents the Royal Hashemite Throne. The crimson velvet sash, lined with white silk, signifies sacrifice and purity. The sash is trimmed in a fringe of golden threads and gathered on either side with golden tasselled cords to reveal a white silk lining.&lt;ref name=hussein&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/coat_arms.html |title=The Coat of Arms |accessdate=November 4, 2017 |last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher= |location= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=archive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jordanembassyus.org/emblem.htm|title=Emblem|accessdate=November 4, 2017|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=Jordanian embassy in the United States|location=Washington|language=|quote=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040203025438/http://www.jordanembassyus.org/emblem.htm|archivedate=February 3, 2004|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=heraldry&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=National_Arms_of_Jordan |title=National Arms of Jordan |accessdate=November 4, 2017 |last= |first= |date= |work=Heraldry of the World |publisher= |location= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lima&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consuladojordanoperu.org/escudo_de_armas.html |title=Escudo de armas |accessdate=November 4, 2017 |last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher=Jordanian consulate in Lima |location=Lima |language=spanish |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Two Flags represent the flag of the Great Arab Revolt. The length of each is double its width and each is divided horizontally into three equal parts: the upper black panel, the middle green panel and the lower white panel. The crimson triangle occupies the front. Its base is equal to the width of the flag while its length is equal to half that of the flag. The Eagle symbolises power, fortitude and loftiness. Its colours signify the banner and turban of the Islamic prophet, [[Mohammad]]. The eagle stands on the globe, its wings touching the flags on both ends. The eagle’s head faces its right. The blue Globe signifies the emergence of Islamic civilisation.&lt;ref name=hussein /&gt;&lt;ref name=archive /&gt;&lt;ref name=heraldry /&gt;&lt;ref name=lima /&gt;

In the Coat of arms appears Arab Weaponry. A bronze shield is decorated with a chrysanthemum, a common motif in Arab art and architecture. The shield is placed in front of the globe, symbolising the defence of the right. Golden swords and spears, bows and arrows protrude from either side of the shield and the globe. Encircling the shield from its base are three ears of wheat on the right and a palm frond to the left. They are attached to the ribbon of the Al Nahda First Order Medal.&lt;ref name=hussein /&gt;&lt;ref name=archive /&gt;&lt;ref name=heraldry /&gt;&lt;ref name=lima /&gt;

The '''coat of arms of the city of [[Bamberg]]''' shows [[Saint George]].&lt;ref name = "datenmatrix" /&gt;

== Description of elements ==
Saint George is seen as the [[patron]] of the [[Cathedral chapter]]. He can be recognized by the [[St George's Cross]] upon his chest and the banner. It is said that the shield belongs to the [[noble family]] [[Andechs-Merania]].&lt;ref name = "datenmatrix" /&gt;

Saint George has two roles in this setting. He is [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] for the coat of arms of the city of Bamberg and [[Supporter]] for the coat of arms of the counts of Andechs-Merania.

== History ==
First uses of the coat of arms in form of a [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] are known since 1279. Across the years the charge changed: in the 14th century it was [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Heinrich II.]] Whereas in 15th and 16th century the ''"[[Bamberger Löwe]]"'' can be found, before again Saint George was used again. Also in the shield the eagle was replaced by a lion or the shield was missing completely.&lt;ref name = "datenmatrix" /&gt;

{{Hatnote|Not to be confused with a [[calorimeter]]''}}
{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}
A '''colorimeter''' is a device used in [[Colorimetry (chemical method)|colorimetry]]. In scientific fields the word generally refers to the device that measures the [[absorbance]] of particular [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] by a specific [[solution]].&lt;ref&gt;Nuffield Advanced Chemistry (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; This device is commonly used to determine the [[concentration]] of a known [[solution|solute]] in a given solution by the application of the [[Beer-Lambert law]], which states that the concentration of a solute is proportional to the absorbance.

==Construction==
[[Image:Spectrophoto-controls.svg|thumb|300px|(1) Wavelength selection, (2) Printer button, (3) Concentration factor adjustment, (4) UV mode selector (Deuterium lamp), (5) Readout, (6) Sample compartment, (7) Zero control (100% T), (8) Sensitivity switch, (9)ON/OFF switch&lt;ref&gt;Colorimetry&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The essential parts of a colorimeter are:
* a '''light source''' (often an ordinary low-voltage filament lamp);
* an adjustable [[aperture]];
* a set of colored [[Filter (optics)|filters]];
* a [[cuvette]] to hold the working solution;
* a detector (usually a [[photoresistor]]) to measure the transmitted light;
* a meter to display the output from the detector.

In addition, there may be:
* a [[voltage regulator]], to protect the instrument from fluctuations in [[Mains power systems|mains voltage]];
* a second light path, cuvette and detector.  This enables comparison between the working solution and a "blank", consisting of pure solvent, to improve accuracy.

There are many commercialized colorimeters as well as [[open source]] versions with construction documentation for education and for research.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3333921/Open-Source_Colorimeter] Anzalone GC, Glover AG, Pearce JM. Open-Source Colorimeter. ''Sensors'' (2013); 13(4):5338-5346&lt;/ref&gt;

Filters:-
Changeable [Filter (optics)|optics filters]are used in the colorimeter to select the wavelength which the solute absorbs the most, in order to maximize accuracy. The usual wavelength range is from 400 to 700 [nanometer] (nm). If it is necessary to operate in the [ultraviolet]range  then some modifications to the colorimeter are needed. In modern colorimeters the filament lamp and filters may be replaced by several (light-emitting diode)of different colors.The Measurement of Colour.

===Cuvettes===
{{Main|Cuvette}}
In a manual colorimeter the cuvettes are inserted and removed by hand. An automated colorimeter (as used in an [[AutoAnalyzer]]) is fitted with a '''flowcell''' through which solution flows continuously.

===Output===
The output from a colorimeter may be displayed by an analogue or digital meter and may be shown as [[transmittance]] (a [[linear]] scale from 0-100%) or as [[absorbance]] (a [[logarithmic scale]] from zero to infinity). The useful range of the absorbance scale is from 0-2 but it is desirable to keep within the range 0-1 because, above 1, the results become unreliable due to scattering of light.

In addition, the output may be sent to a [[chart recorder]], [[data logger]], or [[computer]].

'''Deccani painting''' is a Deccan form of miniature painting, evolved in [[South India|south]]-[[Western India|western]] [[India]]—(also known as [[Deccan]]), during the inception of [[Bahmani Sultanate]] in 1347 AD. The style developed under the patronage of [[Deccan sultanates]]—( namely, [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]], [[Golconda Sultanate|Golkonda]], [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Ahmadnagar]], [[Bidar Sultanate|Bidar]], and [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]] ) and lasted until the extinct of the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] in 1687 AD.&lt;ref name="HIA"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Indian Art|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=2VJADAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=deccani+painting+history&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|last=Kanjilal|first=Kajal|isbn=9789351991182|year=1983|pages=58–59|publisher=Saraswati House Pvt Ltd|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaitanya"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Painting: The modern period|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=McSbSMhArFgC&amp;dq|last=Chaitanya|first=Krishna|isbn=9788170173106|year=1976|page=31|publisher=Abhinav Publications|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark"&gt;{{cite book|title=Deccani Painting|last=Zebrowski|first=Mark|isbn=9780520048782|year=1983|publisher=Sotheby Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While [[Mughal painting]] was developing under [[Akbar]], in the second half of the 16th century, the art form was evolving independently in the Deccan sultanates. The miniature painting style, which flourished initially in the Bahmani court of Bahmani Sultanate and later in the courts of Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, Bidar Berrar and Golkonda is popularly known as the Deccan school of Painting. One of the earliest surviving paintings are found as the illustrations of a manuscript ''[[Tarif-i-Hussain Shahi]]'' (1565 AD), which is now in [[Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal]], [[Pune]]. About 400 miniature paintings are found in the manuscript of [[Nujum-ul-Ulum]] (Stars of Science) (1570), kept in [[Chester Beatty Library]], [[Dublin]].

==Style==

The style of Deccani painting flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries, Passing through multiple phases of sudden maturation and prolonged stagnation, later in the 18th and 19th centuries after the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] conquest of Deccan the style gradually withered away and new form of Hyderabad style painting evolved in the Deccan region particularly in the [[Nizam]] terotary. Most of the colouring of Deccani paintings are Islamic [[Turkish painting|Turkish]] and [[Persian painting|Persian]] tradition specially the arabesques, but those are surmounted by a pure Deccani piece of foliage.

'''''Demon's Souls'''''{{efn|{{Nihongo|デモンズソウル|Demonzu Souru|lead=yes}}}} is an [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[FromSoftware]] for the [[PlayStation 3]]. It was published in Japan by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] in February 2009, in North America by [[Atlus USA]] in October 2009, and in Australia and Europe by [[Namco Bandai Games]] in June 2010. It was the first installment in the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series of games created by game director [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] and was produced under supervision by [[SIE Japan Studio|Sony's Japan Studio]].

Set in a [[dark fantasy]] world, players take control of a hero who has journeyed to the fictional kingdom of Boletaria, which is being ravaged by a cursed fog that brings forth demons who feast on the souls of mortals. The game was described as a [[spiritual successor]] to the ''[[King's Field (series)|King's Field]]'' series of games, while at the same time being described as a separate entity from it. The gameplay involves a character-creation system and emphasizes gathering loot through combat with enemies in a non-linear series of varied locations, with a heavy emphasis on challenging combat. It has a unique online multiplayer system integrated into the single-player where players can leave useful messages and warnings for other players' single-player game worlds, as well as joining other players in their world to assist and/or kill them.

Upon its release, ''Demon's Souls'' was met with acclaim from critics, winning numerous awards. The game was praised for its dark fantasy art design, variation in combat choice and integrated online interactions, and its high [[difficulty level]], with many critics noting it as a genuine challenge. The game ''[[Dark Souls]]'', which itself spawned two sequels, is a [[spiritual successor]] to ''Demon's Souls'', and was also one of the primary inspirations for ''[[Bloodborne]]''.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Demon Souls Screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|The player confronting a red dragon. The light tint around the player character indicates that they have previously died resulting in a reduced health bar and stronger foes]]

Players take control of the main character who, at the start of the game, can be customized by choice of gender, appearance, name and starting class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 10 starting classes, ranging from knights and barbarians to thieves and mages. Each class has its own starting statistics, gear, weapons and type of magic used which all emphasize certain approaches to combat depending on the player's preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As players kill demons, they gain souls which act as currency that can be used to buy, repair, and upgrade weapons as well as increase player statistics such as strength, luck, and endurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with souls, players can retrieve items such as weaponry and ore for upgrading. When a player is killed during a level, they are sent to the beginning of the level with all non-[[boss (video game)|boss]] enemies re-spawned, and the player returns in soul form with lower maximum health and the loss of all unused souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player manages to reach their bloodstain at the point where they were last killed, they regain their lost souls. However, if they are killed before then, the souls are lost permanently. Upon defeating a boss, the player can choose to re-spawn back to that location, marked in the form of an Archstone. When not exploring a level, players reside in the Nexus, a realm of souls that acts as a hub where players can exchange souls, store items and travel between regions. After completing the initial portion of the first region, players can choose to progress through any other of the newly available regions.&lt;ref name="GSReview"/&gt;

Gameplay can change depending on both the World and Character tendency, which can be either white or black. Tendency depends on the actions of the player such as helping or killing [[non-player character|NPCs]]. When white, enemies are easier, yet the soul and items rewards are fewer; when black, enemies are stronger and give greater rewards. Players can manipulate their tendency to suit their current needs. Character tendency affects the player throughout, while World Tendency only affects the region where an action was taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further emphasizing the challenging nature of the game is the increased difficulty upon [[New Game Plus|completion of the story]]. After finishing the game, the player may choose to continue playing from the beginning, except with a 40% increase in difficulty. Subsequent completions increase the difficulty further by 8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/newgame-plus|title=Newgame Plus|accessdate=2010-10-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808124137/http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/newgame-plus|archivedate=2010-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online ===
When connected to the [[PlayStation Network]], online play is integrated into the single-player experience. Throughout levels, players can briefly see the actions of other players as ghosts in the same area that may show hidden passages or switches. When a player dies, a bloodstain can be left in other players' game world that when activated can show a ghost playing out their final moments, indicating how that person died and potentially helping the player avoid the same fate in advance. Players can leave messages on the floor that can also help others such as forewarning safe or hostile positions, trap locations and tactics against enemies or bosses, among general comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-operative play allows up to three characters to team up in the host's game world where visiting players appear in soul form that can only be returned to their bodies when a boss is defeated. In competitive play, players can invade a player's adventure as a Black Phantom to engage in combat with the host player. If the Black Phantom kills the host, they can be returned to their body in their own game, whereas if killed themselves, the host gains a portion of the Black Phantom's souls as well as the phantom losing a player level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North American servers were originally scheduled to be shut off on October 11, 2011, however Atlus decided a month before to keep the servers running until May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Demon's Souls Going Offline Next Month, In North America|url=http://www.ps3trophies.org/news/news-6398-Demon-s-Souls-Going-Offline-Next-Month--In-North-America.html|publisher=PS3T|accessdate=12 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113080535/http://www.ps3trophies.org/news/news-6398-Demon-s-Souls-Going-Offline-Next-Month--In-North-America.html|archivedate=13 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few days prior to the servers shutting down in May, Atlus made another announcement stating that the servers would stay up for the foreseeable future, provided user activity and interest remain constant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news10.net/entertainment/gameguys/article/194937/99/Plan-to-end-Demons-Souls-server-support-scrapped Plan to end Demons' Souls server support scrapped] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926001334/http://www.news10.net/entertainment/gameguys/article/194937/99/Plan-to-end-Demons-Souls-server-support-scrapped |date=2012-09-26 }}. news10.net.

== Plot ==
The game is set in a kingdom called Boletaria, ruled by the aging King Allant XII. Because of his greed, the king began to channel the power of souls, bringing unprecedented prosperity to Boletaria, until the "Deep Fog" covered the land's outskirts, cutting off the kingdom from the outside world. Neighboring kingdoms sent scouts to investigate but none returned after entering the fog.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' King Allant the twelfth, by channeling the power of souls brought unprecedented prosperity to his northern kingdom of Boletaria. That is until the colorless Deep Fog swept across the land. Boletaria was cut off from the outside world, and those who dared penetrate the Deep Fog never returned. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only after Vallarfax of the royal Twin Fangs broke free from the fog that the rest of the world could be told of Boletaria's plight. By channeling souls, King Allant had awakened the [[Old One in fiction#Demon.27s Souls|Old One]], a great demon residing below the Nexus. This created the fog, and unleashed more demons within it that feasted on the souls of mankind, while those left alive without a soul became insane and violent. Without resistance, the fog slowly begins to spread beyond Boletaria.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' But Vallarfax of the royal Twin Fangs broke free from the fog and told the world of Boletaria's plight. That the Old King Allant had aroused the Old One, the great beast below the Nexus, from its eternal slumber. And that a colorless fog had swept in, unleashing terrible demons. The demons hunt down men and claim their souls. Those who lose their souls, also lose their minds. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Maiden in Black and Old One.jpg|right|thumb|The Maiden in Black beckons to the Old One]]
Many brave warriors attempted to breach the fog and save Boletaria, while others were tempted by the prospect of harnessing the demon's souls; either way, many were lost to the fog.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' ...the power of a mature demon's soul is beyond human imagination. The legend spread quickly. Mighty warriors were drawn to the cursed land but none have returned. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player takes control of one such warrior who breaches the fog and enters the lost kingdom;&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' But Boletaria has one final hope. A lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog. Has the land found its savior, or have the demons found a new slave? {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, after entering the palace botanical gardens, the protagonist is confronted by a vile demon, The Vanguard. If the protagonist manages to defeat the Vanguard, they are killed by the Dragon God, another massive demon with a draconic form. After dying, the protagonist, now in soul form, appears in the Nexus. In the Nexus, they are greeted by the Maiden in Black, a mysterious and blinded matron of the Nexus who gives them the quest to travel to each region of Boletaria and retrieve the demon's souls to gain power and eventually free the corrupt kingdom of Boletaria from the Old One.&lt;ref&gt;'''Maiden in Black:''' Souls of the lost withdrawn from its vessel. Let strength be grant so the world might be mended... so the world might be mended. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One by one the protagonist slays the mighty demons, some of whom are the corrupt forms of Boletaria's heroic Round Table knights, that reside in many of Boletaria's notable locations; the Boletarian Palace, Stonefang Tunnel, Tower of Latria, Shrine of Storms, and Valley of Defilement. It is also in these places where they encounter the few remaining great men and women of Boletaria. Once the protagonist claims all the demon's souls and has killed the Arch Demons of each area, the Maiden in Black leads them down below the Nexus to the Old One itself. The Maiden in Black beckons the Old One, who invites the protagonist inside where the now-deformed King Allant XII remains.&lt;ref&gt;'''King Allant:''' You have been chosen by the Old One. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the final battle Allant claims that because of humanity's own violence and suffering, the Old One is acting mercifully by putting "an end to our tragic realm of existence."&lt;ref&gt;'''King Allant:''' Surely you have seen for yourself the pain and suffering that fills this world!  But fight poison with poison.. God is merciful, and so, created the Old One. The Old One will feed upon our souls, and put an end to our tragic realm of existence! {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Allant's defeat, his last words are a warning to the protagonist: "You fool. Don't you understand? No one wishes to go on."
&lt;ref&gt;'''King Allant:''' You fool. Don't you understand? No one wishes to go on. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the end of the game the protagonist makes one last choice either to slay or to walk away from the Maiden in Black. If the protagonist walks away, they have not succumbed to the temptation of the souls. The fog is lifted and the Maiden departs with the Old One back into the fog into its slumber once again, saving Boletaria and the rest of the world, although the souls consumed remain lost for eternity.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' The Old One, along with the maiden, were swept back into the lulling fog. Boletaria was spared from the demons, but also lost its knowledge of soul arts. The souls lost during the pandemonium were never retrieved. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; If, however, the Maiden in Black is killed, they have become lustful for the power of souls, condemning the world with the protagonist as its ruler at the side of the Old One.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' The Old One sensed a new and powerful demon by its side. And before long, the world will be engulfed by the Deep Fog... Bring more souls! {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
According to game director [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]], before the start of the two-year development period,&lt;ref name="GIinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/11/05/feature-demon-s-souls-director-discusses-difficulty-sequels-and-more.aspx|title=Demon’s Souls Director Discusses Difficulty, Sequels, And More|author=MTV Video Games|publisher=MTV|date=2009-10-28|accessdate=2010-01-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209205242/http://gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/11/05/feature-demon-s-souls-director-discusses-difficulty-sequels-and-more.aspx|archivedate=2010-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the studio had previously ruled out the following game to be a new installment in the [[King's Field (series)|''King's Field'' series]].&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; Instead, [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony Computer Entertainment Japan]] producer Takeshi Kajii described the game as a "[[spiritual successor]]" to FromSoftware's earlier series, ''[[King's Field]]'',&lt;ref name="1UP.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3170272 |author=Kevin Gifford |title=Sony Reveals Demon's Souls |publisher=[[1UP.com|1UP]] |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679led3sU?url=http://www.1up.com/news/sony-reveals-demon-souls |archivedate=2012-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he stated "I am a fan of From Software, but naturally that also means there are parts of their games I'm not satisfied with, too," explaining the development choice as an opportunity to be more creative and potentially innovative, stating "If this was a new ''King's Field'' game, there would be areas we wouldn't be able to touch since they're part of the series; working together like this, we can try to make something really new."&lt;ref name="1UP.com"/&gt; He added, "''King's Field'' was the game that sparked the idea for the ''Demon's Souls'' project, but we didn’t base it completely off of that game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2460092/demons-souls-producer-talks-inspiration-and-future-plans/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409022028/http://www.mtv.com/news/2460092/demons-souls-producer-talks-inspiration-and-future-plans/ |archivedate=2017-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Miyazaki stepping in, the project was internally considered a failure, with the team being unable to create a compelling prototype. Miyazaki, who up until then had only worked on the ''[[Armored Core]]'' series, eventually took full control of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-01-demons-souls-was-a-failure-before-miyazaki-stepped-up |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213164931/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-01-demons-souls-was-a-failure-before-miyazaki-stepped-up |archivedate=2017-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He "changed pretty much everything about" the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/ico-showed-bloodborne-s-hidetaka-miyazaki-the-possibilities-of-the-medium--289853.phtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214002347/https://www.destructoid.com/ico-showed-bloodborne-s-hidetaka-miyazaki-the-possibilities-of-the-medium--289853.phtml |archivedate=2017-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it a separate entity from ''King's Field'', with a different perspective and "guided by differing core game design concepts."&lt;ref name="RollingStone"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mielke|first1=James|title='Dark Souls' Creator Miyazaki on 'Zelda,' Sequels and Starting Out|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/dark-souls-creator-miyazaki-on-zelda-sequels-w443435|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=6 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005123700/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/dark-souls-creator-miyazaki-on-zelda-sequels-w443435|archivedate=5 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not consider it a "successor" to ''King's Field'', stating that, while "''King's Field'' was the beginning of the ''Demon's Souls'' project, I wouldn't go as far as to say that we had ''King's Field'' in mind while we were making ''Demon's Souls''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/souls-survivor?page=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524095629/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/souls-survivor?page=2 |archivedate=2017-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miyazaki commented on the game's considerable difficulty as "never the goal", but rather a focus on creating a real sense of accomplishment. Difficulty was described as "one way to offer an intense sense of accomplishment through forming strategies, overcoming obstacles, and discovering new things."&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; Game locations were described as "places of evil intent", such as the Tower of Latria embodying man-made evil, and the Valley of Defilement embodying natural evil, with the difficulty heightening the player's sense of dread.&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; The threat of death that sees players potentially losing all their hard-earned souls was also created to emphasize this mood, that "if the Souls could be recovered anytime, there would be no suspense or sense of accomplishment." Boss battles were primarily designed to be "varied and exciting" to make sure "players didn’t get tired of the same fight" and like the rest of the game "encourage them to figure out different tactics, to think on their feet."&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; Takeshi Kajii felt that the boss battles were not the hardest element; "You say boss, but it’s not just the boss. It’s everything including the road up to the boss that makes this game really hard. If you find patterns to destroy the boss, it’s not that hard. It’s how you get to the boss that makes this a difficult game."&lt;ref name="siliconerainterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2009/07/10/demons-souls-director-didnt-think-demons-souls-was-that-hard/|title=Demon’s Souls Director Didn’t Think Demon’s Souls Was *That* Hard|publisher=Siliconera.com|date=2009-10-28|accessdate=2009-07-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713072612/http://www.siliconera.com/2009/07/10/demons-souls-director-didnt-think-demons-souls-was-that-hard/|archivedate=2009-07-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miyazaki said that the game's [[Balance (game design)|difficulty]] was inspired by the [[trial and error]] difficulty of [[Retrogaming|retro video games]].&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacDonald|first1=Keza|title=Souls Survivor|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/souls-survivor|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=21 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319020959/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/souls-survivor|archivedate=19 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When developing the integrated online feature, Miyazaki felt many new games had what he considered "too much communication in online games which can become a burden for some people," instead integrating the online experience subtly, with certain online elements like the ghostly figures of other human players adding to the dark mood of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ps3hyper.com/news/demons-souls-director-i-wanted-it-to-be-easier-no-plans-for-sequel-yet/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421171858/http://www.ps3hyper.com/news/demons-souls-director-i-wanted-it-to-be-easier-no-plans-for-sequel-yet/ |archivedate=2009-04-21 |title=Demon’s Souls Director: "I Wanted It To Be Easier", No Plans For Sequel Yet|publisher=PS3Hyper|date=2009-04-20|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When implementing the system of allowing players to leave useful messages, instead of allowing players to write a message, a list of pre-written messages was chosen; not only to make the process quick and easy to use since players cannot pause gameplay, but also was to prevent the system from becoming "a large chat, which detracts from the feel of the world."&lt;ref name="siliconerainterview"/&gt;

The game's asynchronous multiplayer system was inspired by a personal experience by Miyazaki, where a car in front of him had stopped on an icy hillside and began to slide downward.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; The car following Miyazaki also began to slide, with the one behind it helping to push the cars up the hill, which then Miyazaki and others also successfully did.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; Unable to give his appreciation to the drivers before leaving the area, he wondered whether the last person in the line had made it to their destination, thinking that he would probably never meet the people again.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; Miyazaki called the experience a "connection of mutual assistance between transient people", which then heavily inspired the game's use of cooperation between players who do not directly communicate.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; The concepts of an in-game messaging system, shared play experience, and mutual role-playing were inspired by [[text messaging]] and [[retro gaming]], particularly the early ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' games.&lt;ref name="dq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/02/08/dark-souls-online-play-to-bring-back-the-feeling-of-old-dragon-quest-games/|title=Dark Souls online play to bring back the feeling of old Dragon Quest games|work=VG247.com|accessdate=4 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630185933/http://www.vg247.com/2011/02/08/dark-souls-online-play-to-bring-back-the-feeling-of-old-dragon-quest-games/|archivedate=30 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; Wanting to remove the ease of communication, Miyazaki explained that everyone was forced to work together when gaming up in the 1980s to help each other due to the lack of easily accessible information at the time, a process he was a fan of.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt;

The game's approach to storytelling was inspired by Miyazaki's experiences of attempting to understand English books he could not read. Because he could not read English, he created his own stories by interpreting what was in the pictures. This inspired him to make a game where players don't understand what's going on, and must interpret things as they play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="It Has to Be Personal" Says 'God of War' Creative Director Cory Barlog|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/it-has-to-be-personal-says-god-of-war-creative-director-cory-barlog-w488948|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Release ===
''Demon's Souls'' was announced in late 2008 and was only dated for a release in Japan, which would later cover localized versions for other parts of east Asia, including Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.com/Demons-Soul-dated-for-Japan--a0005427-p0.php|title=Demon's Soul dated for Japan|author=MTV Video Games|publisher=PlayStation Universe|date=2008-11-09|accessdate=2010-02-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679lfIMl6?url=http://www.psu.com/Demons-Soul-dated-for-Japan--a0005427-p0.php|archivedate=2012-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first release in Japan and Asia on February 5, 2009 was by Sony Computer Entertainment, who did not have any plans to release the game elsewhere. Following the game's Asian release and positive reception, in May Atlus announced plans to publish ''Demon's Souls'' in North America, promoting the game at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009]] (E3) before eventually being released in North America on October 7 that year. The North American version runs on separate online servers, with players of that version not being able to interact with people playing on other regional versions. The same applies to saved games and trophy sets; saves from Asian versions will not work with the North American version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/07/06/playstation-eye-chat-demons-souls|title=PlayStation Eye Chat: Demon’s Souls|website=Official PlayStation.Blog|author=Jeff Rubenstein|publisher=Sony|date=2009-07-06|accessdate=2010-03-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679lgot9E?url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/07/06/playstation-eye-chat-demons-souls/|archivedate=2012-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a separate trophy list is installed from the Asian releases, despite the trophy content being identical.

Regarding a possible European release, [[Eurogamer]] contacted Atlus USA over the matter where their spokesperson Aram Jabbari gave the statement "I'm not aware of any plans/publishers for bringing the game to Europe at this time. Hopefully the game continues to generate word of mouth and positive critical reception and a European publisher takes notice." Additionally, other publishers known for releasing From Software and Atlus games in Europe like [[Tecmo Koei]] and [[Ubisoft]] said they had no plans to release ''Demon's Souls''.&lt;ref name="Euro Release"&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert Purchese |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/demons-souls-uk-release-uncertain |title=Demon's Souls UK release uncertain News |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2009-07-07 |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307021137/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/demons-souls-uk-release-uncertain |archivedate=2010-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, [[Namco Bandai Games]] announced plans to release ''Demon's Souls'' in Europe, with the limited edition released on June 25, 2010.&lt;ref name="LEeurorelease"&gt;{{cite web

In September 2010, Atlus announced that ''Demon's Souls'' would be released in North America under the [[Sony Greatest Hits]] label with a price cut following strong sales, higher than previously expected by the publisher.&lt;ref name="greatesthits"&gt;{{cite web |author=Tom Goldman |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/103514-Demons-Souls-Price-Slashed-By-Gigantic-Halberd |title=Demon's Souls Price Slashed By Gigantic Halberd |publisher=[[The Escapist Magazine]] |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2010-11-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028132339/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/103514-Demons-Souls-Price-Slashed-By-Gigantic-Halberd |archivedate=2010-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Merchandise and other media ==
Upon its release in North America, ''Demon's Souls'' was also released with a Deluxe Edition in a slipcase, along with a 150-page guide book. Prior to the game's release, at the time pre-orders from [[GameStop]] for either the standard or Deluxe version included an official soundtrack disc and art book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5308286/demon-souls-dated-and-bundled-with-swag|title=Demon Souls Dated And Bundled With Swag|author=Mike Fahey|publisher=Kotaku|date=2009-07-06|accessdate=2010-03-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206145758/http://kotaku.com/5308286/demon-souls-dated-and-bundled-with-swag|archivedate=2010-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some copies of the strategy guide however were reported to have "unusual cover ink wear/fading". Having realized this mistake, Atlus responded by launching a temporary replacement program for defect copies on their official website, along with an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/61230|title=Atlus Launches Demon's Souls Strategy Guide Replacement Program|author=Chris Faylor|publisher=Shack News|date=2009-11-12|accessdate=2010-09-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923050122/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/61230|archivedate=2010-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a special edition was released in Europe called ''Demon's Souls: Black Phantom Edition''. Like the North American Deluxe Edition, it contains an art book, soundtrack CD and strategy guide.&lt;ref name="officialeurorelease"/&gt; The strategy guide part of the Black Edition was put together by Namco Bandai Games for no additional production costs with the help of the editors of the fan supported Demon's Souls Wiki hosted by [[Wikidot]], which supported information on each aspect of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5520094/demons-souls-pal-release-has-fan+made-strategy-guide|title=Demon's Souls PAL Release Has Fan-Made Strategy Guide|author=Luke Plunkett|publisher=Kotaku|date=2010-04-19|accessdate=2010-06-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528162208/http://kotaku.com/5520094/demons-souls-pal-release-has-fan+made-strategy-guide|archivedate=2010-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its release in Japan, ''Demon's Souls'' was generally well received by critics. ''[[ASCII Media Works|Dengeki]]'' scored the game 95/85/85/85, adding up to 350 out of 400, saying that "fans of old-school games will shed tears of joy." ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it 29 out of 40 (9/7/7/6), with an editor Paint Yamamoto scoring it a 9 and calling it "a game you learn how to play by losing – you'll face sudden death frequently. But! Keep playing... and you'll realize how deep it really is." However, another editor, Maria Kichiji, gave it a 6 and found the game to be "far too stoic... it's not a game for everybody."&lt;ref name="Dengeki and Famitsu Scores"&gt;{{cite web |first= Nick |last= Des Barres |title= Japan Review Check: Demon's Souls |url= http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3172516 |archive-url= http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522222939/http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3172516 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2016-05-22 |date= 2009-01-28 |publisher= [[1UP.com]] |accessdate= 2010-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon release in North America, the game received critical acclaim with an average critic score of {{Video game review score|reviewer=mc|system=PS3|proseScore=yes}} at [[Metacritic]]. Despite the game's high difficulty, many reviewers found it to be a positive aspect, making the game more rewarding to play. [[GameSpot]] called the high difficulty "fair", saying players will "undoubtedly take a lot of damage until you learn the subtleties of fighting each enemy, but combat feels just right."&lt;ref name="GSReview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/rpg/demonssoul/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;read-review |title=GameSpot Demon’s Souls Review – Brutally challenging and utterly engrossing, this innovative role-playing game is one of the year's best. |publisher=GameSpot |author=Kevin VanOrd |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2010-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105034921/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/rpg/demonssoul/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary%3Bread-review |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] echoed this view, encouraging players who "can remember the good ol' days when games taught through the highly effective use of negative reinforcement and a heavy price for not playing it carefully should scoop this up instantly."&lt;ref name="IGNReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/103/1033437p1.html|title=IGN Demon’s Souls Review – One of the most rewarding, challenging PS3 games finally hits the US.|publisher=IGN|author=Sam Bishop|date=2009-10-09|accessdate=2010-01-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679lwjqgr?url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/103/1033437p1.html|archivedate=2012-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' called it "one of the first truly great Japanese RPGs of this generation, and certainly the most remarkable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/10/20/review.aspx|title=Game Informer Demon’s Souls Review – From Software Gives RPG Players Tough Love|publisher=Game Informer|author=Phil Kollar|date=2009-10-20|accessdate=2010-01-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679m1dNOg?url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/10/20/review.aspx|archivedate=2012-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' however, while commending the game overall, said ''Demon's Souls'' was "best left to the most masochistic, hardcore gamer."&lt;ref name="OPMReview"&gt;{{cite journal | date=December 2009|title=PlayStation: The Official Magazine (US) Demon's Souls|publisher=PlayStation: The Official Magazine|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the game's release in Europe, European critics reviewed import copies. [[Eurogamer]] called ''Demon's Souls'' "stoic, uncompromising, difficult to get to know, but also deep, intriguingly disturbed and perversely rewarding"&lt;ref name="EuroReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/demons-souls-review?page=3|title=Eurogamer: Demon’s Souls Import Review|publisher=Eurogamer|author=Keza McDonald|date=2009-04-23|accessdate=2010-01-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679m6wMUv?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/demons-souls-review?page=3|archivedate=2012-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' explained their positive view on the difficulty by stating "if gaming’s ultimate appeal lies in the learning and mastering of new skills, then surely the medium’s keenest thrills are to be found in its hardest lessons" concluding "for those who flourish under Demon’s Souls’ strict examination, there’s no greater sense of virtual achievement."&lt;ref name="EdgeReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/reviews/review-demons-souls |title=Edge Magazine: Demon’s Souls Import Review |publisher=Edge Magazine |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=2010-01-27 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Demon's Souls'' favorable review scores made the fiscal performance of the game unique because of the lack of a supporting marketing campaign. Gaming analyst [[Jesse Divnich]] commented "''Demon's Souls'' is probably one of the most statistically relevant games released in the gaming world as it helps answer an often asked question: how much would a high quality game sell if it was supported by no mass marketing, released by a little known publisher, and was a new intellectual property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Analysts predict cold October for game industry |url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/analysts-predict-cold-october-for-game-industry/1100-6239455/ |author= Tom Magrino |date= November 10, 2009 |accessdate= October 31, 2016 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171130091505/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analysts-predict-cold-october-for-game-industry/1100-6239455/ |archivedate= November 30, 2017 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the critical and commercial success of the game, Sony Computer Entertainment VP of international software Yeonkyung Kim later admitted that it was a "mistake" to pass on the game, instead allowing Atlus to publish it, initially due to concerns over its difficulty and unusual design decisions.&lt;ref name="2010sales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index-hd.com/up_images_m/files/20100412.pdf |script-title=ja:2010年8月期中間決算説明会 |publisher=Index Holdings |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2010-08-02 |format=PDF |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713024622/http://www.index-hd.com/up_images_m/files/20100412.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre had a seating capacity of 1,050, and staged a variety of performances, including appearances by the [[tango (music)|tango]] artists [[Carlos Gardel]], [[Francisco Canaro]], [[Roberto Firpo]] and [[Ignacio Corsini]]. Glücksmann started his own [[Radio in Argentina|radio]] station in 1924 (''Radio Splendid''), which broadcast from the building where his recording company, ''Nacional Odeón'', made some of the early recordings of the great tango singers of the day. In the late twenties the theatre was converted into a cinema, and in 1929 showed the first [[sound film]]s presented in Argentina.

The ornate former theatre was leased by Grupo Ilhsa in February 2000.&lt;ref name="GrupoIlhsaManzone"&gt;{{cite news |title=El Ateneo Grand Splendid, una joya entre las librerías del mundo |first=Raquel |last=San Martín |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/979452-el-ateneo-grand-splendid-una-joya-entre-las-librerias-del-mundo |newspaper=La Nación |location=Buenos Aires |date=17 January 2008 |accessdate=10 May 2015 |language=Spanish |trans-title=El Ateneo Grand Splendid, a jewel among the libraries of the world |quote=En febrero de 2000, el Grupo Ilhsa firmó un contrato de alquiler por 10 años sobre el edificio e invirtió 3 millones de pesos en remodelaciones, a cargo del estudio del arquitecto Fernando Manzone.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilhsa, through Tematika, owns El Ateneo and Yenny booksellers (totaling over 40 stores), as well as the El Ateneo publishing house.

Chairs are provided throughout the building, including the still-intact theatre boxes, where customers can dip into books before purchase, and there is now a café on the back of what was once the stage.  The ceiling, the ornate carvings, the crimson stage curtains, the auditorium lighting and many architectural details remain. Despite the changes, the building still retains the feeling of the grand theatre it once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top shelves |first=Sean |last=Dodson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/11/bestukbookshops |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=11 January 2008 |accessdate=10 May 2015 |quote=As you can see from this photomontage the El Ateneo has retained its former splendour, with high painted ceiling, original balconies and ornate carvings intact.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'', a prominent British periodical, named El Ateneo Grand Splendid second in its 2008 list of the world's ten best bookshops.&lt;ref name="TheGuardian"/&gt;

New Zealand's '''Fortune Theatre''' lays claim to being the world's southernmost professional theatre company and is the sole professional theatre group in [[Dunedin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dunedinentertainment.co.nz/fortunetheatre FortuneTheatre – DunedinEnternatinment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525014345/http://dunedinentertainment.co.nz/fortunetheatre |date=25 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a regular host of both local and touring shows.

The Fortune Theatre building is registered as a category I historic place by [[Heritage New Zealand]], which recognises its historic and architectural significance.&lt;ref name=architecture&gt;{{cite web | title=Architecture| url=http://www.fortunetheatre.co.nz/historical_information/architecture | publisher=Fortune Theatre  | accessdate=12 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513200514/http://fortunetheatre.co.nz/historical_information/architecture |archivedate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on the corner of [[Moray Place, Dunedin|Moray Place]] and Upper Stuart Street, in the heart of the southern city of Dunedin.

Financial difficulties in 2000 threatened the theatre with closure, and forced the sale of the building to the [[Dunedin City Council]]. The council currently leases the building back to the Fortune Theatre Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dunedin's sole theatre in danger|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3610988|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=11 April 2008|date=17 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2003|title=A look at the multi-million dollar contribution of City Property|journal=City Talk|pages=9|url=http://www.cityofdunedin.com/city/?MIvalObj=citytalk_december2003_preservh&amp;MItypeObj=application/pdf&amp;ext=.pdf|accessdate= 11 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre announced its closure on 1 May 2018, again citing financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/fortune-theatre-closes|title=Fortune Theatre closes|date=1 May 2018|work=Otago Daily Times Online News|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==
The Fortune Theatre company was co-founded by David Carnegie, Alex Gilchrist, Murray Hutchinson and Huntly Elliot. The company has been operational since 1973 and from 1974, was initially located in the 105-seat Otago Cine Club [[theatrette]] at the rear of the Athenaeum building of the Octagon. However, after hiring full-time acting staff in 1977, it was decided that the venue was too small to continue to be viable. Since 1978, the Fortune Theatre has been located in the former Trinity Methodist Church which was opened in 1870 and is close to the city's centre, [[The Octagon, Dunedin|The Octagon]].&lt;ref name=architecture /&gt;

== Education ==
The Fortune Theatre provides a range of options for schools such as tours around the theatre, and opportunities to talk to the cast and crew of a production.

It also offers education workshops which are show-specific. The workshops are designed to link to a range of subjects in the New Zealand Curriculum, including [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement|NCEA]] achievement standards in subjects such as Drama at NCEA levels 1–3.

In addition, the Fortune Theatre hosts a drama ambassador programme to engage students with the theatre by offering opportunities to attend rehearsals as well as complimentary tickets to the shows with the condition recipients review each production. This programme began in 2005 with 19 schools in the [[Otago]] and [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] region areas of New Zealand. Each school can nominate one or two students per term to be their "Drama Ambassador".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortunetheatre.co.nz/education Education – FortuneTheatre.co.nz]&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Larnach – Castle of Lies"==
In 1994, the Fortune Theatre performed a play about the tragedies of [[William Larnach]]'s family, titled "Larnach – Castle of Lies", before 100 invited guests in the ballroom of [[Larnach Castle]].&lt;ref name=play&gt;{{cite web | title=Larnach Castle at Tvnz.co.nz | url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411424/597703 | publisher=One News | date=July 2005 | accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It was a night to remember. As the guests arrived a terrible storm blew up from nowhere. The smoke from the fires blew back down the chimneys so that you couldn't see – and your eyes hurt. Hail crashed on the iron roof so that you couldn't hear. Doors mysteriously opened by themselves and it got very cold. In the play – just as Larnach shot himself there was a blinding white light. Afterwards at supper people were talking about the lightning strike as Larnach held the gun to his head. I said `Oh no that was stage effects.' We asked the stage manager. He said `It was none of our doing, it was lightning.' I think that Larnach was present that night. He didn't like the play."&lt;br&gt;
:-- Margeret Barker (Co-owner of Larnch Castle)&lt;ref name=play /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Building architecture ==
The Trinity Methodist Church was designed by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[R. A. Lawson]] and made out of the local materials trachyandesite and [[Oamaru]] stone. The former church is an example of [[Gothic Revival architecture]] and contains a "Rose" [[stained glass]] window which is located at the back of what is now the theatre's main stage.&lt;ref name=architecture /&gt;

== ''Ghost Hunt'' ==
In 2005, the theatre was featured on ''[[Ghost Hunt (NZ TV series)|Ghost Hunt]]'', a New Zealand television show, as it is claimed that the theatre is haunted. Not long after the Fortune Theatre moved into the old church, tales spread of "sinister voices" being heard offstage and well-secured lights falling from the lighting grid. A phantom audience member has also been reported by theatregoers on numerous occasions. Reports continued to come from a variety of reliable sources until the claimed hauntings of the Fortune Theatre became a part of Dunedin folklore.

The Ghost Hunt investigation team visited the theatre and were shown a picture that is claimed to show the ghost of a young woman gliding through a wall of the [[foyer]], below a Gothic window. During the investigation team's visit, they were also able to talk to people who had worked at the theatre and claim to have had [[paranormal]] experiences in the building:

A [[lighting technician]] claimed that he was all alone setting up on stage one day when he "glimpsed a person" over his shoulder on the edge of the stage and thought that "they were reading through some lines, as an actor would" but knew no cast members were around at the time. He turned the stage lights on and "suddenly they were gone".

A man who ran the box office claimed to have had two "disconcerting" experiences. The first experience involved a "young boy sitting in the corner". He initially "thought nothing of it" but the "realisation struck" him that the theatre was closed. He "turned back around, but he'd disappeared." The second experience involved a girl he claims he noticed when he "looked up to the back corner of the audience seating, near where the soundman usually sits" after he heard "a strange noise in the theatre" on one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Ghost Hunt: True New Zealand Ghost Stories {{ISBN|0-7900-1012-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forum Theatre''' is a non-profit [[theatre company]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/20/AR2006012001926.html|title=Forum Gets a Line On Nonlinear Works|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=21 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 2003, it produces three shows per season and is in residence at the [[H Street Playhouse]].  The company focuses on plays that feature [[storytelling]] and [[theatricality]].  The company also aims to host productions dealing with topics that lend themselves to post-show discussions, which the theatre hosts in the lobby.

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
Forum Theatre was founded in 2003 by Kelly Bartnik, Michael Dove, Paul Frydrychowski, and Mark Wright. Instead of using a single performance method, Forum would explore storytelling styles and artistic media. The founders had backgrounds in film, dance/movement, music, visual art, and theatre.

The company also aimed to bring new or seldom-performed plays to Washington, using the shows to promote artistic expression and discussion. The company’s first productions were a collection of [[Samuel Beckett]] short plays and a movement and video piece called ''All Things Seen'', based on [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[No Exit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.potomacstages.com/TheaterArchives/ForumArchive.htm |accessdate=March 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226002020/http://www.potomacstages.com/TheaterArchives/ForumArchive.htm |archivedate=February 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company performed at the Arena Stage in Washington, [[Warehouse Theater]], [[Church Street Theater]], [[The University of Maryland]], [[The Kennedy Center Millennium Stage]], and [[Round House Theatre]] in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] before taking up residence at the [[H Street Playhouse]] in northeast DC in June 2007. Its production history includes the world premieres of Israeli playwright [[Ami Dayan]]’s ''[[UpShot]]'' and a new translation of ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' commissioned by the company, along with the DC premieres of ''[[Hamletmachine]]'', [[Václav Havel]]'s ''[[The Memorandum]]'', ''[[Kid-Simple: A Radio Play in the Flesh]]'', [[Caryl Churchill]]’s ''[[The Skriker]]'', and [[Don DeLillo]]'s ''[[Valparaiso (play)|Valparaiso]]''.

In October 2006, Forum founded and produced (with the Irish-American arts organization Solas Nua) theDC Samuel Beckett Centenary Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beckettcentenaryfestival.com |accessdate=March 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812223751/http://www.beckettcentenaryfestival.com/ |archivedate=August 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to celebrate the writer’s work and impact on contemporary art. The festival, which took place in several DC venues, included two weeks of theatre productions, film screenings, panel discussions, academic symposia, book clubs, downloadable radio play [[podcast]]s, and the international touring production of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' by Ireland’s [[Gate Theatre]]. The festival was sponsored by the [[Embassy of Ireland]], [[The University of Maryland]], and the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]].

Today, the group has 16 performers, technicians, and theater administrators, supported by a 13-member board. For its 2007–08 season, the company produced [[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''[[Antigone (Anouilh play)|Antigone]]'', ''[[The Last Days of Judas Iscariot]]'' by [[Stephen Adly Guirgis]], and [[Marat/Sade]] by [[Peter Weiss]]. The group later launched a [[blog]] called "OpenForum".

==Description==
The painting depicts two bowls of brightly coloured apples and grapes on a fringed white linen cloth on a wooden table with a small dog sleeping on the floor in the background. It is signed and dedicated "a la Comptesse De N (Nimal)".&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/04/02/uk-italy-gauguin-theft-idUKBREA311H620140402|title=Stolen Gauguin painting found in Italian retiree's kitchen|date=2 April 2014|author=Eleanor Biles|work=Reuters UK edition |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=December 9, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209141304/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/04/02/uk-italy-gauguin-theft-idUKBREA311H620140402|archivedate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Provenance==
The painting, along with [[Pierre Bonnard]]'s ''Woman With Two Armchairs'' (''La Femme Aux Deux Fauteuils''), was stolen from the home of widower Terence F. Kennedy (his wife Mathilda died in 1964) in [[Regent’s Park]] on June 6, 1970. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top five long-lost art masterpieces|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10906999/Top-five-long-lost-art-masterpieces.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=17 June 2014|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Press reports at the time said that Mr Kennedy's housekeeper was duped by three men, one posing as a policeman and the others as burglar alarm engineers, and that they cut the paintings from their frames while she was making them tea.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; After the theft the paintings are alleged to have been smuggled through France on the Paris-to-Turin train,&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; and then to have turned up in the lost-and-found railway depot in Turin. It is said they were auctioned in 1975 and that a worker at the Fiat Factory bought the paintings for a small sum.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;
 
==Recovery==
The paintings are said to have remained in the factory worker's kitchen until an art expert's evaluation in 2014. Once they were identified the [[Carabinieri]] took the paintings into custody. Under Italian law the factory worker could have a right to keep them if he could prove that he bought them in good faith.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;&lt;ref  &gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2595166/Two-paintings-worth-30million-stolen-London-Italian-factory-workers-kitchen-40-years-later.html|title=Two paintings worth £30m - including one by Gaugin - that were stolen from London home in 1970 are found 40 YEARS later in an Italian factory worker's kitchen (after he paid £20 for them) |author=Simon Tomlinson |accessdate=7 April 2014|date=2 April 2014  |work=Daily Mail |publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26848889|title=Stolen Gauguin painting 'hung on factory worker's wall' |author= |accessdate=7 April 2014|date=2 April 2014 |work= |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014 they were returned to him by a court in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Squires |first=Nick |date=12 December 2014 |title=Italian pensioner awarded ownership of Gauguin stolen from London flat |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11289980/Italian-pensioner-awarded-ownership-of-Gauguin-stolen-from-London-flat.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=Rome |access-date=4 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Simultaneously, the sole and universal heir of the original owner, Mr Terence F.

[[File:Pietro_Perugino_cat10.jpg|thumb]]
'''''God the Father with Two Saints''''' is a 1477–78 fresco by [[Perugino]]. It was painted for the church of San Francesco in [[Deruta]] and shows the town at its base, along with the inscription "DECRETO PUBBLICO DFCTA / ANNO D[OMI]NI MCCCCLXXV[II/III]". This shows it was an [[ex voto]] for the end of the plague in 1476 - the two saints are [[Saint Roch|St Roch]] (right) and [[Romanus of Deruta|St Romanus]] (left), both invoked against the plague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2640&amp;context=gradschool_theses |title=The Black Death and Its Effect on Fourteenth- and Fifteenth-Century Art |first=Anna Louise |last=DesOrmeaux |date=May 2007 |publisher=[[Louisiana State University]] |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It comes from the painter's initial period back in Umbria after returning following his training under [[Andrea del Verrocchio]] in Florence. It reuses elements from his previous work  - St Roch's head is similar to that of Balthazar in ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Perugino, Perugia)|Adoration of the Magi]]'', whilst the pavement pattern is from [[Miracles of St Bernardino|''The Miracle of the Stillborn Child'']].

'''''Gone Are the Days!''''' is a 1963 American [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] starring [[Ossie Davis]], [[Ruby Dee]] and [[Godfrey Cambridge]]. It is based on the Broadway play ''Purlie Victorious'', which was written by Davis.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Davis, Dee, Cambridge, [[Beah Richards]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Sorrell Booke]] reprised their roles from the play. This was also Alda's film debut.

* Sorrell Booke as Ol' Cap', Stonewall Jackson Cotchipee

==Reception==
''[[The New York Times]]'' review stated, "The cancers of segregation, blind bigotry and Uncle Tom were made funny but real, and therefore howlingly effective, by the dual artistry of playwright-star Ossie Davis. As a Negro seeing his people and their tormentors comically plain, he filled the stage with humor, insight and passion."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/09/24/archives/purlie-and-his-friends-return-in-a-film-gone-are-the-days.html |title=Purlie and His Friends Return in a Film, 'Gone Are the Days!' |date=September 24, 1963 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic noted, however, that "Mr. Davis's{{sic|,}} manufactured folk tale has, with the passage of just two years and the shedding of blood in Birmingham, lost some of its laughter. And the somewhat static quality of Nicholas Webster's direction, which clings to stage techniques, is not much of a help."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

'''Gordon''', or "Whipped Peter" ([[floruit|fl.]] 1863), was an [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] African American who escaped from a Louisiana [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] in March 1863, gaining freedom when he reached the [[Union Army|Union]] camp near [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. He became known as the subject of photographs documenting the extensive scarring of his back from whippings received in slavery. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionists]] distributed these [[carte de visite]] photographs of Gordon throughout the United States and internationally to show the abuses of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;"The Scourged Slave's Back", ''The Liberator'' (Boston, Massachusetts). September 4, 1863. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1863 these images appeared in an article about Gordon published in ''[[Harper's Weekly]],'' the most widely read journal during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidler 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  The pictures of Gordon's [[scourge]]d back provided [[Union (American Civil War)|Northerners]] with visual evidence of brutal treatment of slaves and inspired many [[Free negro|free blacks]] to enlist in the [[Union Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodyear III, Frank H. "Photography changes the way we record and respond to social issues". Smithsonian Institution&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon joined the [[United States Colored Troops]] soon after their founding, and served as a soldier in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Rymer, Eric. "Ten days from today I left the plantation". Historylink101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Escape==
Gordon escaped in March 1863 from the {{convert|3000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} plantation of John and Bridget Lyons, who owned him and nearly forty other slaves at the time of the [[1860 United States Census|1860 census]].&lt;ref&gt;Abruzzo, Margaret (March 29, 2011). ''Polemical Pain: Slavery, Cruelty, and the Rise of Humanitarianism.'' JHU Press, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Population schedules of the eighth census of the United States, 1860, Louisiana&lt;/ref&gt; The Lyons plantation was located along the west bank of the [[Atchafalaya River]] in [[St. Landry Parish, Louisiana|St. Landry Parish]], between present-day [[Melville, Louisiana|Melville]] and [[Krotz Springs, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyons Shaw, Adonica. "Captain John Lyons of St Landry Parish"&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to mask his scent from the [[bloodhound]]s that were chasing him, Gordon took onions from his plantation, which he carried in his pockets. After crossing each creek or swamp, he rubbed his body with these onions in order to throw the dogs off his scent. He fled over {{convert|40|mi}}&lt;ref&gt;"Civil War CDV of African American Contraband, Baton Rouge, La.". Cowan's Auctions.&lt;/ref&gt; over the course of ten days before reaching [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers of the [[XIX Corps (Union Army)|XIX Corps]] who were stationed in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Typical Negro," ''Harper's Weekly'': 429. July 4, 1863.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrival at Union camp==
[[File:Scourged back by McPherson &amp; Oliver, 1863, retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Photographers of the American Civil War|McPherson and Oliver]]'s photograph of Gordon's scarred back]]
Upon arrival at the Union camp, Gordon underwent a medical examination on April 2, 1863, which revealed severe [[Keloid|keloid scars]] from several whippings. Itinerant photographers William D. McPherson and his partner Mr. Oliver, who were in camp at the time, produced [[carte de visite]] photos of Gordon showing his back.&lt;ref&gt;Shumard, Ann. "Bound for Freedom's Light". Civil War Trust&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gordon, scourged back, in uniform, 1863.png|thumb|right|175px|Escaped slave, turned soldier, Gordon, also known as "Whipped Peter", in the [[United States Colored Troops]], wearing his Union Army uniform]]

During the examination, Gordon is quoted as saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ten days from to-day I left the plantation. Overseer Artayou Carrier whipped me. I was two months in bed sore from the whipping. My master come after I was whipped; he discharged the overseer.&lt;ref&gt;"Scars of slavery". The National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;  My master was not present. I don't remember the whipping.  I was two months in bed sore from the whipping and my sense began to come – I was sort of crazy.  I tried to shoot everybody.  They said so, I did not know.  I did not know that I had attempted to shoot everyone; they told me so.  I burned up all my clothes; but I don't remember that.  I never was this way (crazy) before.  I don't know what make me come that way (crazy).  My master come after I was whipped; saw me in bed; he discharged the overseer.  They told me I attempted to shoot my wife the first one; I did not shoot any one; I did not harm any one.  My master's Capt. JOHN LYON,&lt;ref&gt;Lyons Shaw, Adonica. "Captain John Lyons of St Landry Parish"&lt;/ref&gt; cotton planter, on [[Atchafalaya Basin|Atchafalya]], near [[Washington, Louisiana]].  Whipped two months before Christmas."&lt;ref&gt;Rymer, Eric. "Ten days from today I left the plantation". Historylink101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Service in Union Army==
Gordon joined the [[Union Army]] as a guide three months after the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] allowed for the enrollment of [[freedman|freed slave]]s into the military forces. On one expedition, he was taken prisoner by the [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]]; they tied him up, beat him, and left him for dead. He survived and once more escaped to Union lines.&lt;ref&gt;"A Typical Negro," ''Harper's Weekly:'' 429. July 4, 1863.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon soon afterwards enlisted in a [[United States Colored Troops|U.S. Colored Troops]] Civil War unit. He was said to have fought bravely as a [[sergeant#United States|sergeant]] in the ''[[United States Colored Troops#Corps d.27Afrique|Corps d'Afrique]]'' during the [[Siege of Port Hudson]] in May 1863.&lt;ref&gt;"A Picture for the Times". ''The Liberator'' (Boston). July 3, 1863. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that African-American soldiers played a leading role in an assault.&lt;ref&gt;Shumard, Ann. "Bound for Freedom's Light". Civil War Trust&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''[[The Atlantic]]'''s editor-in-chief [[James Bennet (journalist)|James Bennet]] in 2011 noted, "Part of the incredible power of this image I think is the dignity of that man. He's posing. His expression is almost indifferent. I just find that remarkable. He's basically saying, 'This is a fact.'"&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Michele (December 5, 2011). "'The Atlantic' Remembers Its Civil War Stories," [[NPR]]&lt;/ref&gt;

"I have found a large number of the four hundred [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] examined by me to be badly lacerated as the specimen represented in the enclosed photograph." -- J.W. Mercer, Asst. Surgeon 47th Massachusetts Volunteers, report to Colonel L.B. Marsh, [[Camp Parapet]], Louisiana, 4 August 1863

|quote   = There has lately come to us, from Baton Rouge, the photograph of a former slave—now, thanks to the Union army, a freeman.  It represents him in a sitting posture, his stalwart body bared to the waist, his fine head and intelligent face in profile, his left arm bent, resting upon his hip, and his naked back exposed to full view.  Upon that back, horrible to contemplate! is a testimony against slavery more eloquent than any words.  Scarred, gouged, gathered in great ridges, knotted, furrowed, the poor tortured flesh stands out a hideous record of the slave-driver's lash.  Months have elapsed since the martyrdom was undergone, and the wounds have healed, but as long as the flesh lasts will this fearful impress remain.  It is a touching picture, an appeal so mute and powerful that none but hardened natures can look upon it unmoved.  However much men may depict false images, the sun will not lie.  From such evidence as this there is no escape, and to see is to believe.  Many, therefore, desired a copy of the photograph, and from the original numerous copies have been taken.

The surgeon of the [[1st Louisiana Native Guard (United States)|First Louisiana regiment, (colored,)]] writing to his brother in the city, encloses this photograph, with these words: –

&lt;blockquote&gt;I send you the picture of a slave as he appears after a whipping.  I have seen, during the period I have been inspecting men for my own and other regiments, ''hundreds of such sights''—so they are not new to me; but it may be new to you.  If you know of any one who talks about the ''humane manner'' in which the slaves are treated, please show them this picture.  It is a lecture in itself.|source = {{cite news|title= —Picture of a Slave|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/824572/the_liberator/?|work=[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]|date=12 June 1863|location=Boston, Massachusetts|page=2}}}}

{{quote box |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width = 75% |align=center
|quote  = We received from Baton Rouge the photographic likeness of a slave's naked back, lacerated by the whip ...  We look on the picture with amazement that cannot find words for utterance.  Amazement at the cruelty which could perpetrate such an outrage as this; at the brutal folly, the stupid ignorance, that could permit such a piece of infatuation; at the absence not only of humane feeling, but of economical prudence of common sense, of ordinary intelligence, displayed in such frantic thoughtlessness.  Among what sort of people are such things possible? ... This card-photograph should be multiplied by the hundred thousand, and scattered over the states.  It tells the story in a way that even [[Harriet Beecher Stowe|Mrs. Stowe]] cannot approach; because it tells the story to the eye.  If seeing is believing — and it is in the immense majority of cases — seeing this card would be equivalent to believing things of the slave states which Northern men and women would move heaven and earth to abolish!

==Biography==
DePaul grew up in Maryland and graduated from NYU. After college, he worked as a private investigator and wrote for ''[[The Washington Post]]''. In 1998, DePaul moved to Los Angeles, where he directed his own play, ''Motherlove''. DePaul teamed with writer Hank Nelken to create a comic short film, ''Jerry Mashugana'', a parody of the hit comedy ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', which starred [[Matt Damon]], [[Geoffrey Rush]] and [[Demi Moore]].

==Career==
''[[Saving Silverman]]'', starring [[Jack Black]] and [[Jason Biggs]], which was released by Sony Pictures in 2001. The film falls within a cross-genre film type from the late 1990s and early 2000s in which grooms are saved, or nearly saved, from distasteful marriage.&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;Adam Sternbergh (January 28, 2004). [http://www.slate.com/id/2094507/ "The Devil Wears Pearls: In recent movies, grooms across America flee their frigid fiancees"]. [[Slate Magazine]].&lt;/ref&gt; It opened at No. 3 at the North American box office making $7.4&amp;nbsp;million [[USD]] in its opening weekend. The film grossed a domestic total of $19,402,030 and $26,086,706 worldwide from a $22&amp;nbsp;million budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{mojo title|savingsilverman|Saving Silverman}}&lt;!--whole para so far--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Killer Bud'', was produced independently. It was [[Robert Stack]]'s final film prior to his death in 2003.

He then wrote ''Bride Wars'', starring Kate Hudson, Anne Hathaway and Candace Bergen. DePaul got the idea when he and his wife were planning a double wedding with her sister.&lt;ref name="scriptmag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scriptmag.com/features/career-features/selling-screenplay-screenwriter-greg-depaul-career-writing-comedy|title=Selling Your Screenplay: Screenwriter Greg DePaul on His Career Writing Comedy - Script Magazine|website=scriptmag.com|accessdate=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="la-screenwriter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-screenwriter.com/2016/11/28/screenwriter-greg-depaul-on-his-career-as-a-comedy-screenwriter/|title=Screenwriter Greg DePaul On His Career as a Comedy Screenwriter|website=LA Screenwriter|accessdate=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its opening weekend, the film grossed $21,058,173 ranking #2 at the box office.&lt;ref name="BOM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bridewars.htm |title=Bride Wars (2009) |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese [[remake]] [[Bride Wars (2015 film)|of the same name]] was released in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/bride-wars-review-1201576787/|title= Film Review: ‘Bride Wars’|author= Maggie Lee|date= August 24, 2015|accessdate= 2015-10-10|work= [[variety.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Jesus: The Evidence''''' is a three-part television [[miniseries]] made by [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT) for [[Channel 4]], and transmitted in the UK in 1984 over the Easter period (Ep.1 - 8 April 1984; Ep.2 -15 April 1984; and Ep.3 - 22 April 1984). The series was one of the first television attempts to ‘demythologize’ the [[Gospel]] narratives.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}   The series suggests that the [[Jesus]] of the Bible was a [[myth]] created by the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]], and [[First Council of Nicaea|developed by the established Church]] in the fourth century.

== Production ==

The series was the first major religious commission by the UK’s newly established fourth channel, and signaled a major departure from the largely non-critical approach to religious subject-matter that had been established from the earliest days of the [[BBC]].  In setting itself up to be deliberately provocative, questioning and speculative, the series sparked a furore, and marked a significant moment in the deterioration in the relationship between the Christian churches, and the UK's broadcasting institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallis|first=Richard|date=2016-01-27|title=Channel 4 and the declining influence of organized religion on UK television. The case of Jesus: The Evidence|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01439685.2015.1132821|journal=Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television|language=en|volume=36|issue=4|pages=668–688|doi=10.1080/01439685.2015.1132821|issn=0143-9685}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series's content referenced a range of popularized treatments of the search for the ‘real’ Jesus, including Hugh Schonfield’s ''[[The Passover Plot]]'', and Morton Smith’s ''[[Jesus the Magician]]''.

 The idea for the series was sparked by an article about ''The Gnostic Gospels'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/6346170|title=The gnostic Gospels|last=1943-|first=Pagels, Elaine H.,|date=1980, ©1979|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|isbn=0297777092|location=London|oclc=6346170}}&lt;/ref&gt; an award-winning book by the American scholar [[Elaine Pagels]], which was previewed in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in December 1979&lt;ref&gt;Whale, John ‘The Gospel of the Losers’, The Sunday Times, December 2, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; tweaking the interest of [[John Birt, Baron Birt|John Birt]] who at that time was Director of Programmes at LWT.  An accompanying book of the same name was produced with the series by author [[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]] who also appeared as an interviewee.

The series featured a number of notable scholars, including [[Helmut Koester]], [[Werner Kümmel]], [[Dennis Nineham]], [[Morton Smith]], [[I. Howard Marshall|I Howard Marshall]], [[George Albert Wells|George A Wells]], and [[Géza Vermes|Geza Vermes]].

The show was narrated by actor, [[Jeremy Kemp]]; researched by [[imdbname:0103873|Jean-Claude Bragard]]; produced and directed by David W. Rolfe; Executive Produced by Jane Hewland; and Series Produced by Julian Norridge.

== Controversy ==

The series became the focus of a campaign of protest led by the Evangelical youth magazine, ''Buzz'', which drew wide support from across many sections of the churches (particularly the Evangelical and Catholic wings).  One leading commentator noted that what the series demonstrated was the way in which Channel 4 was ‘not so much the last of the main public service channels to arrive, as the first swallow heralding the broadcasting pluralism of cable and satellite’&lt;ref&gt;Longley, Clifford, 'Sceptics discount vital evidence' ''The Times'', 9 April 1984; p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; .  According to Bonner and Aston (2003):&lt;blockquote&gt;The producers did not help themselves either by including a statue of Christ that symbolically exploded in slow-motion.  Originally intended to illustrate a point made by Albert Schweitzer, it became a sort of visual punctuation mark used several times in the first and second programmes, causing genuine offence to some.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bonner|first=Paul|title=Cable and Satellite|date=2003|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9780230287136_11|work=Independent Television in Britain|volume=|pages=169|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9781349396207|access-date=2018-08-21|last2=Aston|first2=Lesley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]] then Regius Professor of Divinity at [[University of Cambridge]], commented that the programmes ‘juxtaposed perfectly sensible scholarly opinions with opinions so outré and hard to defend on rational grounds that disservice was done to the sensible people by the company they were portrayed as keeping’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''League of the Left-Wing Writers''' ({{zh|t=中國左翼作家聯盟|p=Zhōngguó Zuǒyì Zuòjiā Liánméng}}), commonly abbreviated as the '''Zuolian''' or '''Left League''', was an organization of writers formed in [[Shanghai]], China, on 2 March 1930, at the instigation of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and the influence of the celebrated author [[Lu Xun]]. Other prominent members included [[Ding Ling]], [[Hu Feng]], and [[Mei Zhi]].&lt;ref name=sina&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2008-03-12/113615131996.shtml | title=张晓风：我的父亲母亲 | trans-title=Zhang Xiaofeng: My father and mother | language=Chinese | last1=Zhang 张 | first1=Xiaofeng 晓风 | website=Sina | date=12 March 2008 | access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the League was to promote [[socialist realism]] in support of the Communist Revolution, and it eventually became very influential in Chinese cultural circles. Lu Xun delivered the opening address to the organizational meeting, but he became disillusioned when it quickly became clear that he would have little influence.&lt;ref name="CAM"&gt;Leo Oufan Lee,  "Literary Trends: The Road to Revolution 1927-1949," Ch 9 in {{cite book | last1=Fairbank | first1=John King | last2=Feuerwerker | first2=Albert | last3=Twitchett | first3=Denis Crispin | title= The Cambridge history of China |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fxs3ROaIhPMC&amp;pg=PA428 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, England | year=1986 | ISBN=9780521243384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members included leaders of the [[Sun Society]] and the [[Creation Society]], and [[Zhou Yang (literary theorist)|Zhou Yang]], who became [[Mao Zedong]]'s favorite literary figure and after 1949 zealously enforced  political orthodoxy. The League articulated theories on the political role of literature that foreshadowed Mao's influential [[Yan'an Talks on Literature and Art]], and engaged in running debates with the "art for art's sake" [[Crescent Moon Society]].{{sfnb|Spence|1981|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=DwgvjqO5ivUC&amp;pg=PA1977-IA59&amp;dq=goldman+literary+dissent&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=40V_VIzsOsv3yQSUx4CYBg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Left%20wing%20league&amp;f=false]}}

Due to the League's prominent political views, it was quickly banned by the [[Kuomintang]] government. On 7 February 1931, the government executed five members of the League: [[Li Weisen]], [[Hu Yepin]], [[Rou Shi]], [[Yin Fu (writer)|Yin Fu]], and [[Feng Keng]]. They are known as the [[Five Martyrs of the League of Left-Wing Writers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wong |first=Lawrence Wang-Chi |title=Politics and Literature in Shanghai: The Chinese League of Left-Wing Writers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-FRAQAAIAAJ |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-7190-2924-4 |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The League was disbanded voluntarily in 1936. This was mainly in order to encourage authors to unite across political boundaries and face the rapidly increasing threat from Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8550">'''Misorientation''' is the difference in [[Crystallography|crystallographic]] orientation between two [[Crystallite|crystallites]] in a polycrystalline material.

In crystalline materials, the orientation of a crystallite is defined by a transformation from a sample reference frame (i.e. defined by the direction of a rolling or extrusion process and two orthogonal directions) to the local reference frame of the crystalline lattice, as defined by the basis of the [[unit cell]].  In the same way, misorientation is the transformation necessary to move from one local crystal frame to some other crystal frame.  That is, it is the distance in orientation space between two distinct orientations.  If the orientations are specified in terms of matrices of direction cosines g&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and g&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, then the misorientation operator ∆g&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt; going from A to B can be defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{B}=\Delta g_{AB} g_{A}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_{AB}=g_{B}g_{A}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where the term g&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is the reverse operation of g&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, that is, transformation from crystal frame A back to the sample frame.  This provides an alternate description of misorientation as the successive operation of transforming from the first crystal frame (A) back to the sample frame and subsequently to the new crystal frame (B).

Various methods can be used to represent this transformation operation, such as: [[Euler angles]], Rodrigues vectors, [[axis angle|axis/angle]] (where the axis is specified as a crystallographic direction), or [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|unit quaternions]].

== Symmetry and misorientation ==
The effect of [[crystal symmetry]] on misorientations is to reduce the fraction of the full orientation space necessary to uniquely represent all possible misorientation relationships.  For example, cubic crystals (i.e. FCC) have 24 symmetrically related orientations.  Each of these orientations is physically indistinguishable, though mathematically distinct.  Therefore, the size of orientation space is reduced by a factor of 24.  This defines the '''fundamental zone''' (FZ) for cubic symmetries.  For the misorientation between two cubic crystallites, each possesses its 24 inherent symmetries.  In addition, there exists a switching symmetry, defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_{AB}=\Delta g_{BA}&lt;/math&gt;
which recognizes the invariance of misorientation to direction; A→B or B→A.  The fraction of the total orientation space in the cubic-cubic fundamental zone for misorientation is then given by:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{24\cdot24\cdot2}=\frac{1}{1152}&lt;/math&gt;
or 1/48 the volume of the cubic fundamental zone.  This also has the effect of limiting the maximum unique misorientation angle to 62.8°&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Disorientation''' describes the misorientation with the smallest possible rotation angle out of all symmetrically equivalent misorientations that fall within the FZ (usually specified as having an axis in the standard stereographic triangle for cubics).  Calculation of these variants involves application of crystal symmetry operators to each of the orientations during the calculation of misorientation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_{AB}=O_{B}^{crys}g_{B}(O_{A}^{crys}g_{A})^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
where O&lt;sup&gt;crys&lt;/sup&gt; denotes one of the symmetry operators for the material.

== Misorientation distribution ==
[[Image:MDF rodrigues AA5083.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Example MDF shown in Rodrigues space for a sample of AA5083 plate]]

The misorientation distribution (MD) is analogous to the [[Orientation distribution function|ODF]] used in characterizing texture.  The MD describes the probability of the misorientation between any two grains falling into a range &lt;math&gt;d \Delta g&lt;/math&gt; around a given misorientation &lt;math&gt;\Delta g&lt;/math&gt;.  While similar to a probability density, the MD is not mathematically the same due to the normalization.  The intensity in a MD is given as "multiples of random density" (MRD) with respect to the distribution expected in a material with uniformly distributed misorientations.  The MD can be calculated by either series expansion, typically using generalized [[spherical harmonics]], or by a discrete binning scheme, where each data point is assigned to a bin and accumulated.

== Graphical representation ==
[[Image:Mackenzie plot.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Distribution of misorientation angles for a randomly texture polycrystal, from Mackenzie(1958)]]

Discrete misorientations or the misorientation distribution can be fully described as plots in the Euler angle, axis/angle, or Rodrigues vector space.  Unit quaternions, while computationally convenient, do not lend themselves to graphical representation because of their four-dimensional nature.  For any of the representations, plots are usually constructed as sections through the fundamental zone; along φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in Euler angles, at increments of rotation angle for axis/angle, and at constant ρ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (parallel to &lt;001&gt;) for Rodrigues.   Due to the irregular shape of the cubic-cubic FZ, the plots are typically given as sections through the cubic FZ with the more restrictive boundaries overlaid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mackenzie plots are a one-dimensional representation of the MD plotting the relative frequency of the misorientation angle, irrespective of the axis.  Mackenzie determined the misorientation distribution for a cubic sample with a random texture.

== Example of calculating misorientation ==
The following is an example of the algorithm for determining the axis/angle representation of misorientation between two texture components given as Euler angles:
:Copper [90,35,45]
:S3 [59,37,63]
The first step is converting the Euler angle representation to an orientation matrix ''g'' by:
&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
c\phi_{1}c\phi_{2}-s\phi_{1}s\phi_{2}c\Phi &amp; s\phi_{1}c\phi_{2}+c\phi_{1}s\phi_{2}c\Phi  &amp; s\phi_{2}s\Phi\\ 
-c\phi_{1}s\phi_{2}-s\phi_{1}c\phi_{2}c\Phi &amp; -s\phi_{1}s\phi_{2}+c\phi_{1}c\phi_{2}c\Phi &amp; c\phi_{2}s\Phi\\ 
s\phi_{1}s\Phi &amp; -c\phi_{1}s\Phi &amp; c\Phi 
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''c''''' and '''''s''''' represent ''cosine'' and ''sine'', respectively.  This yields the following orientation matrices:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_{copper}=\begin{bmatrix}
-0.579 &amp; 0.707 &amp; 0.406 \\
-0.579 &amp; -0.707 &amp; 0.406 \\
0.574 &amp; 0 &amp; 0.819 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_{S3}=\begin{bmatrix}
-0.376 &amp; 0.756 &amp; 0.536 \\
-0.770 &amp; -0.577 &amp; 0.273 \\
0.516 &amp; -0.310 &amp; 0.799 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
The misorientation is then:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_{AB}=g_{copper}g_{S3}^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}
0.970 &amp; 0.149 &amp; -0.194 \\
-0.099 &amp; 0.965 &amp; 0.244 \\
0.224 &amp; -0.218 &amp; 0.950 \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
The axis/angle description (with the axis as a unit vector) is related to the misorientation matrix by:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;cos\Theta=(g_{11}+g_{22}+g_{33}-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_{1}=(g_{23}-g_{32})/(2sin\Theta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_{2}=(g_{31}-g_{13})/(2sin\Theta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_{3}=(g_{12}-g_{21})/(2sin\Theta)&lt;/math&gt;
(There are errors in the similar formulae for the components of 'r' given in the book by Randle and Engler (see refs.), which will be corrected in the next edition of their book. The above are the correct versions, note a different form for these equations has to be used if Theta = 180 degrees.)

For the copper—S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; misorientation given by Δg&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;, the axis/angle description is 19.5° about [0.689,0.623,0.369], which is only 2.3° from &lt;221&gt;.  This result is only one of the 1152 symmetrically related possibilities but does specify the disorientation.  This can be verified by considering all possible combinations of orientation symmetry (including switching symmetry).

A '''national personification''' is an [[anthropomorphism]] of a [[nation]] or its people. It may appear in [[editorial cartoon]]s and [[propaganda]].

Some early personifications in the Western world tended to be national manifestations of the majestic wisdom and war goddess [[Minerva]]/[[Athena]], and often took the [[Latin]] name of the ancient [[Roman province]]. Examples of this type include [[Britannia (emblem)|Britannia]], [[Germania (personification)|Germania]], [[Hibernia (personification)|Hibernia]], [[Helvetia]] and [[Polonia (personification)|Polonia]]. Examples of personifications of the [[Liberty (goddess)|Goddess of Liberty]] include [[Marianne]], the [[Statue of Liberty]] (''Liberty Enlightening the World''), and many examples of United States coinage. Another ancient model was [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]], a female [[deity]] who personified the city of [[Rome]] and more broadly, the Roman state, and who was revived in the 20th Century as the personification of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s "[[New Roman Empire]]". Examples of representations of the [[everyman]] or citizenry in addition to the nation itself are [[Deutscher Michel]], [[John Bull]] and [[Uncle Sam]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, "Mass-Producing Traditions: Europe, 1870-1914," in Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger, eds., ''The Invention of Tradition'' (Cambridge, 1983), 263-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nature morte''''' (''Still Life''), or '''''Compotier et cruche décorée de cerfs''''', is a Cubist painting by the French artist [[Jean Metzinger]]. It was exhibited at ''Exposició d'Art Cubista'', [[Galeries Dalmau]], Barcelona, 20 April – 10 May 1912 (no. 44). During this show—the first exhibition of [[Cubism]] in Spain—Metzinger's painting became one of the preferred targets of the press.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=qd60qRgFrrAC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=1912,+l%27Exposici%C3%B3+d%27art+cubista+de+les+Galeries+Dalmau,+Metzinger&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wQdktxAWDc&amp;sig=QGvryVtxM_xuoB6v-pW8_LWIAa8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kxnSVKijMqHa7gaL0oDYCA&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Metzinger&amp;f=false Mercè Vidal i Jansà, ''1912, l'Exposició d'art cubista de les Galeries Dalmau'', Volume 6 of ''Les Arts i els artistes: Breviari'', Edicions Universitat Barcelona, 1996] {{ISBN|8447513831}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was exhibited again 1 – 15 April 1917 at Nya Konstgalleriet (The New Art Gallery) founded by the Italian [[Futurism|Futurist]] Arturo Ciacelli in Stockholm (reproduced in the catalogue).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/eq/5559591592/in/photostream/ Jean Metzinger, ''Nature Morte'', Nya Konstgalleriet, Flamman, Katalog Över Konstverk, Ur Samling Tillhörande, Flammans redaktion, 1 – 15 April 1917]&lt;/ref&gt; Nya Konstgalleriet was one of the three main galleries in Sweden responsible for promoting national and international modernism between 1915 and 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=PVAjAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Cultural+History+of+the+Avant-Garde+in+the+Nordic+Countries+1900-1925&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4SLTVIbZHJCR7AaTvYD4DQ&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20Cultural%20History%20of%20the%20Avant-Garde%20in%20the%20Nordic%20Countries%201900-1925&amp;f=false Hubert van den Berg, Irmeli Hautamäki, Benedikt Hjartarson, ''A Cultural History of the Avant-Garde in the Nordic Countries 1900-1925'', Rodopi, 2012] {{ISBN|9401208913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=bvsfioiQ8k8C&amp;pg=PA668&amp;lpg=PA668&amp;dq=%22Nya+Konstgalleriet%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-VsvCs2oD7&amp;sig=jTvblrp_kiQYHn_dBOFcUiQfda0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eQHTVLCXPIqM7AbB94H4Cg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nya%20Konstgalleriet%22&amp;f=false Peter Brooker, Sascha Bru, Andrew Thacker, Christian Weikop, ''The Oxford Critical and Cultural History of Modernist Magazines: Europe 1880 - 1940'', Oxford University Press, May 19, 2013] {{ISBN|0199659583}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting would eventually be exhibited at Galerie Philippe Reichenbach, Houston, where it was acquired in 1960.

==Description==
[[File:Jean Metzinger, Juan Gris, Marie Laurencin, August Agero, Veu de Catalunya, 25 April 1912.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], c.1911, ''Nature morte (Compotier et cruche décorée de cerfs)''; [[Juan Gris]], 1911, ''Study for Man in a Café''; [[Marie Laurencin]], c.1911, ''Testa ab plechs''; August Agero, sculpture, ''Bust''; [[Juan Gris]], 1912, ''Guitar and Glasses'', or ''Banjo and Glasses''. Published in Veu de Catalunya, 25 April 1912]]
''Nature morte'', signed "JMetzinger" (lower right), is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 93.5 x 66.5&amp;nbsp;cm (36 3/4 by 26 1/4 in.), representing a [[still life]]. It is an interior scene depicting various objects including a compotier filled with fruit, a carafe, pears, a cup, a vase of flowers, and a jug (''cruche'') decorated with dear (''cerfs''). The objects are placed on a diamond-shaped table. In the 'background' (upper left) is another table with a glass and bowl resting on it.

The colors employed by the artist are typical of early Cubism, ranging from reds to earth tones and greens—a legacy of [[Paul Cézanne]].

Rather than blurring the distinction between superimposed elements with irregular brushstrokes, Metzinger has clearly outlined each object with a thin dark line.

The vertical composition is treated is a highly personal geometrically Cubist style with various planes, angles, layers and facets. The table upon which objects are placed is angled as if seen from above. The fruits, bowl, jug and other elements are depicted as if seen from a side view and from above simultaneously, giving an illusion of an overall flattening of the picture plain—a devise used by Cézanne, from which all of the Cubists drew inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020543#skipToContent Christopher Green, MoMA, ''Cubism, Technical and stylistic innovations'', From Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Cézanne's reduction of the visible world into fundamental shapes (cone, cube, sphere), the faceted reconstruction of nature through purely painterly forms, the fracture and flattening of space,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/features/slideshows/paul-cezanne.html Paul Cézanne, ''Still Life with Milk Jug and Fruit'', c. 1900, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt; are all present in Metzinger's picture. However, where the dialectic nature of Cézanne's work had been greatly influential during the highly expressionistic phase of [[proto-Cubism]], between 1908 and 1910, the work of [[Georges Seurat]], with its flatter, more linear structures, would capture the attention of Metzinger from early 1911.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann"&gt;[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com/ Alex Mittelmann, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

:"With the advent of monochromatic Cubism in 1910-1911," writes art historian Robert Herbert, "questions of form displaced color in the artists' attention, and for these Seurat was more relevant. Thanks to several exhibitions, his paintings and drawings were easily seen in Paris, and reproductions of his major compositions circulated widely among the Cubists. The [[Le Chahut|Chahut]] [Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo] was called by André Salmon "one of the great icons of the new devotion", and both it and the ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Cirque (Circus)]]'', Musée d'Orsay, Paris, according to [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], "almost belong to Synthetic Cubism".&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert L. Herbert, 1968, ''Neo-Impressionism'', The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Published on the front page of El Correo Catalán, 25 April 1912]]
The concept was well established among the French avant-garde that painting could be expressed mathematically, in terms of both color and form. This mathematical expression resulted in an independent and compelling 'objective truth,' perhaps more so than the objective truth of the object represented.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt; Indeed, the [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionists]] had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis in the domain of color (Seurat addresses these problems in ''Circus'' and ''Dancers''). Soon, the Cubists were to do so in both the domain of form and dynamics ([[Orphism (art)|Orphism]]) would later do so with color too.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

Published in Apollinaire's 1913 ''Les Peintres Cubistes'', Exhibited at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants. Provenance: Jacques Nayral, [[Niels Bohr]]]]
Metzinger played a crucial role in the establishment of the Cubist movement, on both artistic and theoretical levels (organizing and exhibiting at the first public manifestations of Cubism at the 1910 and 1911 Salons; and publishing a series of writings in well-established literary journals defining and defending Cubism. Metzinger was the first to write that four artists had dismissed traditional perspective and felt free to move around their subjects, studying them from various points.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |date=October–November 1910 |title=Note sur la peinture |journal=Pan |pages=60 }} in {{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1910"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture (Note on painting)'', Pan, Paris, October–November 1910, 649-51, reprinted in Edward Fry ''Cubism'', London, 1966. Quotation of the original French have been translated by Daniel Robbins&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Golding, ''Cubism: A History and an Analysis'', London, 1959, p. 27)&lt;/ref&gt; In this seminal work, he compares the similarities between the paintings of [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]]. In doing so he enunciated for the first time what would become known as the primary characteristics of [[Cubism]]: the notions of [[simultaneity]] and mobile perspective. In this 1910 text Metzinger stressed the distance between their works and traditional perspective. These artists, he wrote, granted themselves 'the liberty of moving around objects', and combining many different views in one image, each recording varying experiences over the course of time.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, Cubism and Culture, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1910-11, Deux Nus (Two Nudes, Two Women), oil on canvas, 92 x 66 cm, Gothenburg Museum of Art, Sweden.jpg|thumb|Jean Metzinger, 1910-11, ''[[Deux Nus|Deux Nus (Two Nudes, Two Women)]]'', oil on canvas, 92 x 66 cm, [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]], Sweden. Exhibited at the first Cubist manifestation, Room 41 of the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]], Paris]]
Of this group, only Metzinger and Braque were familiar with the works of Picasso, and Metzinger alone, familiar with the works of everyone in the group. Metzinger was the first to recognize explicitly and implicitly the significance of the use of "a free, mobile perspective", and the "mixing... of the successive and the simultaneous".&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1910" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985"&gt;Daniel Robbins, 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nature morte'' shows Metzinger's particular interest in the use of mathematics and geometry. In ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', written the following year, Metzinger and Gleizes proclaimed: 
:"To establish pictorial space, we must have recourse to tactile and motor sensations, indeed to all our faculties. It is our whole personality which, contracting or expanding, transforms the plane of the picture. As it reacts, this plane reflects the personality back upon the understanding of the spectator, and thus pictorial space is defined: a sensitive passage between two subjective spaces. The forms which are situated within this space spring from a dynamism which we profess to dominate. In order that our intelligence may possess it, let us first exercise our sensitivity. There are only nuances. Form appears endowed with properties identical to those of color. It is tempered or augmented by contact with another form, it is destroyed or it flowers, it is multiplied or it disappears".&lt;ref name="Sotheby's" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, ''Du "Cubisme", published by Eugène Figuière Éditeurs, Paris, 1912. Translated in Robert L. Herbert (ed.), ''Modern Artists on Art'', New York, 1986, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Nature morte'' "shows the artist's mastery of abstraction and geometry", writes Sotheby's in their Lot notes, "all of the compositional elements combine to create a remarkable evocation of the still-life subject". In this way, ''Nature morte'' achieves the artist's goals "of engaging with and enveloping the viewer".&lt;ref name="Sotheby's" /&gt;

'''Non-vegetarian''' is an [[Indian English]] word that is used to refer to a person who is not a [[vegetarian]] i.e. someone who consumes meat, especially as a major source of protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVYZAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=non-vegetarian|title=Cohesion|date=1970|publisher=Nehru Institute of National Integration.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnvEu8ss4h8C&amp;pg=PA29|title=Nutrition And Health: The Vegetarian Way|last=Staff|first=Institute Of Naturopathy|last2=(Bangalore)|first2=Institute of Naturopathy and Yogic Sciences|date=2002-12-01|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd|isbn=9788120724242|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the meaning is readily understood, this term is not common parlance in most English-speaking countries where meat consumption is the norm and vegetarianism or veganism is rare.

A related word is [[Eggetarian]], that refers to a vegetarian who consume [[Egg as food|egg]]-based products but not meat.

== In popular usage ==
* In India, it is mandatory that [[Convenience food|packaged food products]] be marked with [[Vegetarian and non-vegetarian marks]], which are green and reddish-brown symbols that clearly indicate whether they are suitable for vegetarians or non-vegetarians respectively.
[[File:India vegetarian labels.svg|thumb|In India, labeling of packaged food products is mandatory to distinguish between ''non-vegetarian'' (reddish-brown) and ''vegetarian'' (green) products]]
* 
* In India and Pakistan, non-vegetarian cuisine has been heavily influenced by the coastal, trading as well as immigrant cultures including Arabic, Turkic, Mughal, [[Iranian cuisine|Persian]] as well as Portuguese, French and British leading to various indigenous forms of cuisine such as [[Mughlai cuisine|Mughlai]], [[Hyderabadi cuisine|Hyderabadi]], [[Awadhi cuisine|Awadhi]], [[Maharashtrian cuisine|Kolhapuri]], [[Malvani cuisine|Malvani]], [[Chettinad cuisine|Chettinad]] and [[Thalassery cuisine|Malabari]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sr3GUyWe3O0C|title=Curry: A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors|last=Collingham|first=Lizzie|date=2006-02-06|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199883813|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ljFDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22non-vegetarian%22|title=Rare Gems: A Non-vegetarian Gourmet Collection from Maharashtra|last=Mehendale|first=Āditya|date=2015|publisher=Om Books International|isbn=9789384625214|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.While coming to non-veg, chettinad restaurants plays an important role&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anjappar.com/|title=Anjappar Restaurants - Global Ambassadors of Chettinad Cuisine|website=www.anjappar.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In India, most restaurants serving meat publicly and explicitly display the title 'non-vegetarian restaurant' or 'non-vegetarian hotel' (In India, the term ''hotel'' may colloquially refer to a restaurant or a hotel).

'''Parenthetical referencing''', also known as '''Harvard  referencing''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://libweb.anglia.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm| title=Harvard System of Referencing Guide| date=21 May 2012| publisher=Anglia Ruskin University| accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[citation]] style in which partial citations—for example, "(Smith 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;1)"—are enclosed within [[parentheses]] and embedded in the text, either within or after a sentence. They are accompanied by a full, alphabetized list of citations in an end section, usually titled "references", "reference list", "works cited", or "end-text citations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.williams.edu/citing/styles/chicago2.php "Author–date system], Chicago Manual of Style, Williams College Libraries, accessed 25 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pears, R and Shields, G ''Cite them right : the essential referencing guide'' (2008) {{ISBN|978-0-9551216-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parenthetical referencing can be used in lieu of [[Note (typography)|footnote]] citations (the [[Vancouver system]]).

There are two styles of parenthetical referencing:
* Author–date: primarily used in the natural sciences and social sciences, and recommended by the [[American Chemical Society]] and the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA);
* Author–title or author–page: primarily used in the arts and the humanities, and recommended by the [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA).

== Origins and use ==
According to an 1896 paper, the origin of the author–date style is attributed to a paper by Edward Laurens Mark, Hersey professor of anatomy and director of the zoological laboratory at Harvard University, who may have copied it from the cataloguing system used then and now by the library of Harvard's [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]].&lt;ref name=Chernin&gt;Chernin, Eli (1988). [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1834803&amp;blobtype=pdf "The 'Harvard system': a mystery dispelled"],  ''British Medical Journal.'' October 22, 1988, pp. 1062–1063.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 Mark wrote a paper on the embryogenesis of the garden slug, in which he included an author–date citation in parentheses on page 194, the first known instance of such a reference.&lt;ref&gt;Mark, Edward Laurens (1881). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bn0tAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Maturation, fecundation, and segmentation of Limax campestris, Binney"], ''Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College,'' Volume 6, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, according to Eli Chernin writing in the ''British Medical Journal'', references had appeared in inconsistent styles in footnotes, referred to in the text using a variety of printers' symbols, including asterisks and daggers. Chernin writes that a 1903 [[festschrift]] dedicated to Mark by 140 students, including [[Theodore Roosevelt]], confirms that the author–date system is attributable to Mark. The festschrift pays tribute to Mark's 1881 paper, writing that it "introduced into zoology a proper fullness and accuracy of citation and a convenient and uniform method of referring from text to bibliography." According to an editorial note in the ''British Medical Journal'' in 1945, an unconfirmed anecdote is that the term "Owen system" was introduced by an English visitor to Harvard University library, who was impressed by the citation system and dubbed it "Harvard system" upon his return to England.&lt;ref name=Chernin/&gt;

Although it originated in biology, it is now more common in humanities, history, and social science.  It is favored by a few scientific journals, including the major biology journal ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]].''

=={{anchor|Author-date}} Author–date==
In the author–date method (Harvard referencing), the in-text citation is placed in parentheses after the sentence or part thereof that the citation supports. The citation includes the author's  name, year of publication, and page number(s) when a specific part of the source is referred to (Smith 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;1) or (Smith 2008:1). A full citation is given in the references section: Smith, John (2008). ''Name of Book''. Name of Publisher.

===How to cite===
The structure of a citation under the author–date method is the author's surname, year of publication, and page number or range, in parentheses, as illustrated in the Smith example near the top of this article.
* The page number or page range is omitted if the entire work is cited. The author's surname is omitted if it appears in the text. Thus we may say: "Jones (2001) revolutionized the field of trauma surgery."
* Two authors are cited using "and" or "&amp;": (Deane and Jones 1991) or (Deane &amp; Jones 1991). More than two authors are cited using "[[Et al#et alii|''et al.'']]": (Smith ''et al.'' 1992).
* In some documentation systems (e.g., MLA style), an unknown date is cited as having "no date of publication" by the abbreviation for "no date" (Deane, n.d.).&lt;ref name=EastAnglia&gt;[http://libweb.anglia.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm?harvard_id=66#66 "References with missing details"], "Harvard System of Referencing Guide", University of East Anglia, accessed 25 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In such documentation systems, works without pagination are referred to in the References list as "not paginated" with the abbreviation for that phrase (n. pag.).&lt;ref name=EastAnglia/&gt;
* "No place of publication" and/or "no publisher" are both designated the same way (n.p.) and placed in the appropriate spot in the bibliographical citation (''Harvard Referencing''.  N.p.).&lt;ref name=EastAnglia/&gt;
* A reference to a republished work is cited with the original publication date either in square brackets (Marx [1867] 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;90) or separated with a slash (Marx, 1867/1967, p.&amp;nbsp;90).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = American Psychological Association | title = Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association | edition = 5th | publisher = American Psychological Association | location = Washington, DC, USA | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-1-55798-791-4 | page = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of the original publication year qualifies the suggestion otherwise that the publication originally occurred in 1967.
* If an author published several books in 2005, the year of the first publication (in the alphabetic order of the references) is cited and referenced as 2005a, the second as 2005b and so on.
* A citation is placed wherever appropriate in or after the sentence. If it is at the end of a sentence, it is placed before the period, but a citation for an entire block quote immediately ''follows'' the period at the end of the block since the citation is not an actual part of the quotation itself.
* Complete citations are provided in alphabetical order in a section following the text, usually designated as "Works cited" or "References." The difference between a "works cited" or "references" list and a bibliography is that a bibliography may include works not directly cited in the text.
* All citations are in the same font as the main text.
* Note that "[t]he 'Harvard System' is something of a misnomer, as there is no official institutional connection. It's another name for the author/date citation system, the custom of using author and date in parentheses, e.g. (Robbins 1987) to refer readers to the full bibliographic citations in appended bibliographies. Some Harvard faculty were among the first practitioners in the late 19th century, and the name stuck, particularly in England and the Commonwealth countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Harvard system for citing references?|url=http://asklib.hcl.harvard.edu/faq/81735|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820040237/http://asklib.hcl.harvard.edu/faq/81735|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 August 2015|website=Harvard College Library's Ask a Librarian service|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also note that there is no official guide to Harvard citation style,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mullan|first1=W.M.A.|title=DFST Harvard Reference Generator|url=https://www.dairyscience.info/harvard/referencegen.php|publisher=Dairy Science and Food Technology (DSFT)|accessdate=17 July 2016|quote=Note the Harvard system of referencing is not 'tightly' specified and some variation in the use of capital letters, italics, the use of parentheses and text styles does occur in different institutions and journals. Please check the 'house style' that is specified for your publication, thesis, dissertation or assignment before submitting your work.}}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently variations occur across various online Harvard citation and referencing guides. For example, some universities instruct students to type a book's publication date ''without'' parentheses in the reference list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Guide to Harvard Style Referencing|url=https://library.sydney.edu.au/subjects/downloads/citation/Harvard_Complete.pdf|website=University Library|publisher=The University of Sydney|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Harvard System of Referencing (5th edition)|url=http://libweb.anglia.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm|website=University Library|publisher=Anglia Ruskin University|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In giving the city of publication, an internationally well-known city (such as London, The Hague, or New York) is given as the city alone. If the city is not internationally well known, the country (or state and country if in the U.S.) is given.

An example of a newspaper reference:
* Bowcott, Owen (October 18, 2005). [https://www.theguardian.com/animalrights/story/0,11917,1594716,00.html "Protests halt online auction to shoot stag"], ''The Guardian''.

===Advantages===
* The principal advantage of the author–date method is that a reader familiar with a field is likely to recognize a citation without having to check in the references section.  This is most useful in fields whose works are commonly known by their date of publication (for example, the sciences and social sciences in which one cites, say, "the 2005 Johns Hopkins study of brain function"), or if the author cited is notorious (for example, HIV denialist [[Peter Duesberg]] on the cause of [[AIDS]]).
* The use of author–date systems helps the reader easily identify sources that may be outdated.
* If the same source is cited more than once, even a reader unfamiliar with the author may remember the name.  It quickly becomes obvious if the publication is relying heavily on a single author or single publication.  When many different pages of the same work are cited, the reader does not need to flip back and forth to footnotes or endnotes full of "[[ibid.]]" citations to discover this fact.
* With the author–date method, there is no renumbering hassle when the order of in-text citations is changed, which can be a scourge of the [[Vancouver system|numbered endnotes system]] if house style or project style insists that citations never appear out of numerical order. (Computerized [[reference-management software]] automates this aspect of the numbered system [for example, Microsoft Word's endnote system, Wikipedia's &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; system, [[BibTeX|LaTeX/BibTeX]], or [[Comparison of reference management software|various applications marketed to professionals]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.)
* Parenthetical referencing works well in combination with substantive notes.  When the note system is used for source citations, two different systems of note marking and placement are needed—in Chicago Style, for instance, "the citation notes should be numbered and appear as endnotes. The substantive notes, indicated by asterisks and other symbols, appear as footnotes" ([[#refChicagoManualOfStyle2003|"Chicago Manual of Style" 2003]], 16.63-64). This approach can be cumbersome in any circumstances. When it is not possible to use footnotes altogether probably because of the publisher's policy, it results in two parallel series of endnotes, which can be confusing to readers. Using parenthetical referencing for sources avoids such a problem.
* The reader can find the in-text author–date citations of a specific work more easily. Finding in-text numbered citations is more difficult because some will not appear if they are included in ranges.

===Disadvantages===
* The principal disadvantage of parenthetical references is they take up space in the main body of the text and are distracting to a reader, especially when many works are cited in a single place (which often occurs when reviewing a large body of previous work).  Numbered footnotes or endnotes, by contrast, can be combined into a range, e.g. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[27–35]&lt;/nowiki&gt;".  However this disadvantage is offset by the fact that parenthetical referencing may be economical for the overall document since, for instance, "(Smith 2008: 34)" takes up a small amount of space in a paragraph, whereas the same information would require a whole line in a footnote or endnote.
* In many disciplines in the arts and humanities, date of publication is often not the most important piece of information about a particular work.  Thus, in author–date references such as "(Dickens 2003: 10)", the date is essentially redundant or meaningless when read on the page, since works may go through numerous editions or translations long after the original publication. Compare a reference in a science discipline such as "The last survey indicated that four hundred were left in the wild (Jones ''et al.'' 2003)", where the date ''is'' meaningful.  The reader of certain forms of arts and humanities scholarship may thus be better aided by the use of author–title referencing styles such as MLA: for example, "(Dickens ''Oliver'', 10)", where meaningful information is given on the page.  Historical scholarship is an exception, since, when citing a primary source, date of publication ''is'' meaningful, though in most branches of history footnotes are preferred on other grounds.  Generally speaking, however, it is instructive that author–date systems such as [[Parenthetical referencing#Origins and use|Harvard were devised by scientists]], whereas author–title systems such as [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA]] were devised by humanities scholars.
* Similarly, because works are frequently reprinted in many arts and humanities disciplines, different author–date references might refer to the same work.  For example, "(Spivak 1985)", "(Spivak 1987)", and "(Spivak 1996)" might all refer to the same essay — and might be better rendered in author–title style as "(Spivak 'Subaltern')".  Such ambiguities may be resolved by adding an original date of publication, for example, "(Spivak 1985/1996)", though this is cumbersome and exacerbates the principal disadvantage of parenthetical referencing, namely its distraction for the reader and unattractiveness on the page.
* Rules can be complicated or unclear for non-academic references, particularly those where the personal author is unknown, such as government-issued documents and standards.
* When removing a portion of text which has citations in it, the editor(s) must also check the ''Reference'' sections to see if the sources cited in the removed text is used elsewhere in the paper or book, and if not, to delete any reference not actually cited in the text (although this issue can be eliminated by the use of [[Reference management software|reference manager software]]).
* The use of the author–date methods (but not author–title) can be confusing when used in monographs about particularly prolific authors.  In-text citation and back-of-the-book listings of works arranged by date of publication are conducive to errors and confusion: for example, Harvey 1996a, Harvey 1996b, Harvey 1996c, Harvey 1996d, Harvey 1995a, Harvey 1995b, Harvey 1986a, Harvey 1986b, and so on.
* The mixing of text with frequent parentheses and long strings of numbers is typographically inelegant.
* Most historical journals (apart from economic and social history) use footnotes because of the need for maximum flexibility. Primary source references to archives, etc., involve long and complex information, all of which may be immediately relevant to a serious reader. An interesting example of this arose with the famous work of the anthropologists John and Jean Comaroff, ''Of Revelation and Revolution'' which treated historical events from anthropological perspective: although parenthetical references were used for scholarly sources, the authors found it necessary to use notes for the historical archive material they were also using.

==Author–title==
In the author–title or author–page method, also referred to as [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]], the in-text citation is placed in parentheses after the sentence or part thereof that the citation supports, and includes the author's  name (a short title only is necessary when there is more than one work by the same author) and a page number where appropriate (Smith 1) or (Smith, ''Playing'' 1).  (No "p." or "pp." prefaces the page numbers and main words in titles appear in capital letters, following MLA style guidelines.)  A full citation is given in the references section.

==Content notes==
{{See also|The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers#Content notes}}
A content note generally contains useful information and explanations that do not fit into the primary text itself. Content notes may be given as [[footnote]]s or [[endnote]]s or even a combination of both footnotes and endnotes.  Such content notes may themselves contain a style of parenthetical referencing, just as the main text does.

The slipcover was a popular treatment in the United States after World War II as early twentieth-century building styles had fallen out of fashion.

'''Sonika Keturah Jermina Mckie''' (born October 21, 1988), known [[mononymously]] as '''Sonika''', is a [[Granada|Grenadian]] [[singer-songwriter]] and [[recording artist]], based in the [[Eastern Caribbean]] island of [[Grenada]].

Born in [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]], [[Grenada]], her professional career began when she was approached,&lt;ref name="Sonika approached by Metronome Manager"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika approached by Metronome Manager|url=http://keepinbeat.com/artists/sonika|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Manager of Metronome Records,&lt;ref name="Metronome Records"&gt;{{cite web|title=Metronome Records|url=http://www.keepinbeat.com/|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nima Anvar, who had seen her performance on May 29, 2010 at the Grenada Best Talent Competition Final &lt;ref name="Grenada's Best Talent Competition Final"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grenada's Best Talent Competition Final|url=http://www.weefmgrenada.com/article.php?newstype=1&amp;newsid=564|publisher=Wee FM Grenada|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;(an initiative of Wayne "Waggy T" Redhead&lt;ref name="Article establishing who Wayne 'Waggy T' Redhead is"&gt;{{cite web|title=Article establishing who Wayne 'Waggy T' Redhead is|url=http://glenelgspringwater.com/2013/04/22/10th-anniversary-celebrated-in-a-big-way/|publisher=glenelgspringwater.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other local sponsors). Shortly after this, Anvar offered Sonika an opportunity &lt;ref name="Sonika offered management opportunity"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika offered management opportunity|url=http://keepinbeat.com/artists/sonika|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be managed by him and to develop her career. During 2011, Sonika accepted&lt;ref name="Sonika accepts management offer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika accepts management offer|url=http://keepinbeat.com/artists/sonika|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the offer.

Under Anvar’s management, Sonika was introduced to an organized method for approaching her development as a serious artist. In the process, Anvar pulled in a team of persons to develop Sonika into an international artist.

Team members at the inception included local talk show host of Chit Chat&lt;ref name="Chit Chat on Flow"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chit Chat on Flow|url=http://discoverflow.co/grenada/cc6-community-channel/program-guide|publisher=Flow Grenada}}&lt;/ref&gt; and media personality, Lexan Fletcher&lt;ref name="Lexan Fletcher"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lexan Fletcher|url=http://www.lexanfletcher.com/|publisher=Lexan Fletcher|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [originally a co-partner at Metronome Records], who assisted as an image consultant; Annette Moore, who advised on social media strategies and development; Hervin Hood,&lt;ref name="Hervin Hood"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hervin Hood|url=http://keepinbeat.com/aboutus|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Full Sail University]] Music &amp; Entertainment Business alum, Anvar's then co-partner at Metronome Records who dealt with studio recording, assisted by Joshua "J-Beatz" Benjamin,&lt;ref name="Joshua 'J Beatz' Benjamin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joshua 'J Beatz' Benjamin|url=https://soundcloud.com/joshua-jay-beatz-benjamin|publisher=Soundcloud|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a young sound engineer prodigy; Xpert Productions/Studio,&lt;ref name="Xpert Productions &amp; Studio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Xpert Productions &amp; Studio|url=http://www.xpertstudiomusic.com/|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comprises John James and his brother Jason 'Xpert' James from the neighboring island of [[Carriacou]]; Sean "Fame" Nelson,&lt;ref name="Sean Fame Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Sean 'Fame'|title=Sean 'Fame' Nelson|url=https://soundcloud.com/f-a-prodz|publisher=Soundcloud|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a UK-based, Grenadian Music Producer; Samuel Ogilvie,&lt;ref name="Samuel Ogilvie"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samuel Ogilvie|url=https://www.elance.com/s/soproofers/|publisher=elance.com|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who did the storyboarding for Sonika's [[music videos]] and who also assisted with the filming of videos and the video recording of several of her covers; Darryl Friday,&lt;ref name="Darryl Friday at Metronomeps"&gt;{{cite web|title=Darryl Friday at Metronomeps|url=http://www.metronomeps.com/|publisher=metronomeps.com|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a film school graduate, who filmed and edited Sonika’s Gone Away&lt;ref name="Gone Away"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gone Away|url=http://keepinbeat.com/music-video-premiere-sonika-gone-away|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; music video, as well as other consultants, who assisted with image development and brand marketing.

In 2013, due to pressing responsibilities Anvar handed management over to artist development associate, Annette Moore, who, together with consultant, [[Mike Adams (football coach)|Mike Adams]], continued Sonika's development.

To date, Sonika has released five&lt;ref name="Sonika - released singles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika - released singles|url=http://www.7digital.com/artist/sonika|publisher=7 Digital|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[single (music)|single]]s between April 2012 and September 2013; she has sung to audiences both locally &lt;ref name="Sonika - local audience"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika - local audience|url=http://keepinbeat.com/sonika-wows-at-d-best-of-friends|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and internationally;&lt;ref name="International Performance"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Performance|url=http://keepinbeat.com/sonika-gold-cup|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; released a music video for her first single, "Gone Away&lt;ref name="Gone Away"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gone Away|url=http://keepinbeat.com/gone-away|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;", which went to #1 on [[Tempo Networks]]; is the first Grenadian artist to have a [[VEVO]] channel and recently filmed and is about to release a music video for "Please Don’t Let It Go"&lt;ref name="Article with reference to video for Please Don't Let It Go"&gt;{{cite web|title=Article with reference to video for Please Don't Let It Go|url=http://auxmusicproductions.com/2013/04/30/artist-profile-sonika/|publisher=auxmusicproductions|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (her second single).

Sonika is currently working on writing and recording more original singles and clearly defining her sound, style and image.

== Career ==
Sonika wrote and recorded a [[Reggae]] single at the age of 16 in 2004, entering the studio for the very first time. The song "I Love You" was produced by Rodney "Piper" Bartholomew,&lt;ref name="Rodney 'Piper' Bartholomew"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rodney 'Piper' Bartholomew|url=http://grizique.webs.com/piper.htm|publisher=grizique.webs.com|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Grenadian producer. Sonika did not venture further into recording until 2010, when she wrote and recorded a Pop song, "Electrik",&lt;ref name="Electrik by Sonika"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrik by Sonika|url=http://www.frequency.com/video/sonika-ft-sgod-electrik/2156131|publisher=frequency.com|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was produced by Sandman in 2011 at his Aquarion Studios, featuring local rapper S God. Both of those songs remained local and were not positioned for release to the outside market. Sonika’s first productions for international release were done with Metronome Records, when she began working with Anvar.

Sonika also entered several singing competitions, including the Digicel Rising Stars Competition&lt;ref name="Digicel Rising Stars"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digicel Rising Stars|url=http://www.televisionjamaica.com/Programmes/DigicelRisingStars.aspx|publisher=televisionjamaica.com|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she represented Grenada in a regional [[Karaoke]] competition held in [[St. Kitts]] in 2006.

Sonika’s original development pathway focused heavily on [[R&amp;B]]. In 2011 she began vocal coaching with an experienced classical, [[vocal coach]] in Grenada, Mrs. Valerie Daniel-Burkhardt, mother of former 2007 Ms. World semi-finalist [[Vivian Burkhardt]]. However, in 2012 Sonika moved on to seeking genre-specific coaching for R&amp;B from a Los Angeles-based, Christian Rock artist and vocal coach, [[Ken Tamplin]], thereby strengthening and defining her vocal range. Between 2011 and 2012 Sonika became immersed in writing her own songs, recording, taking music theory courses, doing regular vocal practice sessions,&lt;ref name="Vocal Practice Sessions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vocal Practice Sessions|url=http://kentamplinvocalacademy.vanillaforums.com/discussion/1833/ken-tamplin-vocal-academy-reviews-does-it-really-work|publisher=Ken Tamplin Vocal Academy|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; performing both her original music&lt;ref name="Performance of Original Song"&gt;{{cite web|title=Performance of Original Song|url=http://www.firstpost.com/topic/person/pimp-c-fly-away-dont-let-me-in-sonika-mckie-original-song--video-OpKrZ2Q6ek8-21942-1.html|publisher=firstpost.com|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and covering popular artists,&lt;ref name='Sonika covers "Brand New Me" by Alicia Keys'&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika covers "Brand New Me" by Alicia Keys|url=http://www.nme.com/nme-video/youtube/id/nysgUKuT8Rc/search/brand%2B|publisher=nme.com|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a regular basis at various events,&lt;ref name="Performance at Spice Basket"&gt;{{cite web|title=Performance at Spice Basket|url=http://keepinbeat.com/sonika-valentines|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sonika performs at D' Best of Friends"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika performs at D' Best of Friends|url=http://keepinbeat.com/sonika-wows-at-d-best-of-friends|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Performance at Kirani James National Celebration Rally"&gt;{{cite web|title=Performance at Kirani James National Celebration Rally|url=http://keepinbeat.com/kirani-rally|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the local circuit.

During 2012 all of Sonika’s preparation and work started coming together with the release of her first original song, the self-penned R&amp;B track "Gone Away". Shortly after the song’s release on [[iTunes]], it was on heavy rotation on the Caribbean SuperStation&lt;ref name="Sonika's Interview with Caribbean Superstation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika's Interview with Caribbean Superstation|url=https://soundcloud.com/sonika-mckie/sonikas-interview-with|publisher=Soundcloud|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local radio stations. Sonika did several interviews on TV&lt;ref name="Interview with Chit Chat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Chit Chat|url=http://vidgrids.com/sonika-mc-kie|publisher=vidgrids.com|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview with Converse Carib"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Converse Carib|url=http://vidgrids.com/sonika-mc-kie|publisher=vidgrids.com|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Radio&lt;ref name="Caribbean Superstation Interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caribbean Superstation Interview|url=https://soundcloud.com/sonika-mckie/sonikas-interview-with|publisher=Soundcloud|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plans were made for the conceptualization and [[storyboarding]] of the music video for "Gone Away". On August 27, 2012 the video was released on [[YouTube]] and was featured on [[Tempo Networks]], where it speedily climbed to #1 on the charts and remained there for eight (8) consecutive weeks. Shortly after, on September 10, 2012, Sonika became the first Grenadian to have access to a [[VEVO]] channel and her music video was then posted on that medium, having been previously released on Metronome Records’ YouTube channel. At that point, Sonika continued to work to release her second self-penned song, "Please Don’t Let It Go".

"Please Don’t Let It Go" was released in July 2012, a month prior to an event that Grenadians had been anticipating for months. Nineteen (19) year old 2011 [[400m]] [[World Championships in Athletics|World Champion]], [[Kirani James]], an athlete from the western side of Grenada, was about to compete in the [[2012 London Olympics]]. Everyone believed that Kirani would win the 400m final race and he did, on August 6, breaking a national record and becoming the first Grenadian to ever win an [[Olympic medal]] and the first Grenadian to win an [[Olympic Gold Medal]]. The country erupted into a state of festivity&lt;ref name="Grenadians Celebrate Kirani James' Victory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grenadians Celebrate Kirani James' Victory|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/07/us-oly-grenada-kirani-idUSBRE87613B20120807|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was a strong resurgence of National Pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resurgence of National Pride over Kirani James' Olympic Victory|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/athletics/8768029/London-2012-Olympics-Kirani-James-is-the-teenager-from-Grenada-who-became-the-new-kid-on-the-block-in-Daegu.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Olympics, the Grenada Broadcasting Network&lt;ref name="Grenada Broadcasting Network"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grenada Broadcasting Network|url=http://www.klassicgrenada.com/|publisher=Grenada Broadcasting Network|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the freshly released "Please Don’t Let It Go", as the [[theme song]] for the Olympics,&lt;ref name="Please Don't Let It Go used as Grenada's Olympic Song"&gt;{{cite web|title=Please Don't Let It Go used as Grenada's Olympic Song|url=http://www.weefmgrenada.com/article.php?newstype=1&amp;newsid=4130|publisher=WeeFM|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the nature of the [[lyrics]], which focused on holding on to one’s dreams. At the homecoming ceremony for Kirani James,&lt;ref name="Homecoming Ceremony for Kirani James"&gt;{{cite web|title=Homecoming Ceremony for Kirani James|url=http://www.grenadaconsulate.com/uploads/files/kirani_james_homecoming.pdf|publisher=Grenada Consulate|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Grenada, Sonika performed "Please Don’t Let It Go&lt;ref name="Sonika to Perform at the Kirani James National Celebration Rally"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika to Perform at the Kirani James National Celebration Rally|url=http://keepinbeat.com/kirani-rally|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;", before a crowd of several thousands,&lt;ref name="Crowd at Kirani James National Celebration Rally"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crowd at Kirani James National Celebration Rally|url=http://thenewtoday.gd/local-news/2012/09/11/september-1-kirani-day/|publisher=The New Today Newspaper|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had gathered to celebrate with the Olympic Champion at the [[Grenada National Stadium]], in St. George's. It was her biggest audience thus far, as a performer. The rest of 2012 was marked by with requests for performances, featuring "Please Don't Let It Go", at many of local events. Consequently, that period became one of the most hectic and demanding periods for Sonika, in her still new career as a performer.

Between 2011 and 2012, Sonika established herself on the local and regional music scene&lt;ref name="Sonika on the Regional Music Scene"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika on the Regional Music Scene|url=http://thecaribbeancurrent.com/grenaian-r-b-sensation-sonika-mckie/|publisher=The Caribbean Current|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a talent to watch.  Although continuing to write her original music, she also continued to do YouTube covers, with one particular cover gaining considerable attention - [[Alicia Keys]]’ "[[Brand New Me (Alicia Keys song)|Brand New Me]]". The cover&lt;ref name="Sonika's Keys' "&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika's Cover of Alicia Keys' "Brand New Me"|url=http://vidgrids.com/sonika-mc-kie|publisher=vidgrids.com|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; has since amassed over 20, 000 views.

In 2013, Sonika got a referral from local head of the [[Grenada Football Association]], Cheney Joseph,&lt;ref name="Referral to CONCACAF from Cheney Joseph"&gt;{{cite web|title=Referral to CONCACAF from Cheney Joseph|url=http://keepinbeat.com/sonika-gold-cup|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheney Joseph"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheney Joseph|url=http://grenadasports.gd/grenada-will-participate-cfu-womens-u-20-tournament-president-defies-executive/|publisher=grenadasports.gd|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, after hearing her original music and covers of popular artists, made a call to [[Enrique Sanz de Santamaría|Enrique Sanz]], General Secretary of the [[Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football]] [CONCACAF].

What followed was that Sonika was asked to perform at a private gala event at the [[Chicago Art Institute|Modern Wing of the Chicago Art Institute]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], on Saturday, July 27, 2012 – the day before [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] game. It was Sonika’s first international performance. The only two acts to perform that night were Sonika and [[Leah LaBelle]], a young female artist signed to [[Epic Records]]/[[So So Def Recordings]].

Returning home in August of 2013, Sonika was offered yet another opportunity to perform internationally. This led to her performing at [[Carifesta|CARIFESTA XI]] at the Caribbean Marketplace for the Arts,&lt;ref name="Caribbean Marketplace for the Arts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caribbean Marketplace for the Arts|url=http://www.caribbeannewsnow.com/topstory-CARIFESTA-XI-comes-to-an-end-in-Suriname-17410.html|publisher=Caribbean News Now|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Suriname]] on August 22, 2013, to an audience of nationals from [[CARICOM]] member and associate member states, as well as persons from other countries.

In September 2013 Sonika released three original songs – two self-penned and the other written for her by her now former manager, Anvar. The releases include one ballad, "Don’t Let Me In&lt;ref name="Don't Let Me In"&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Let Me In|url=http://www.amoeba.com/don-t-let-me-in-sonika/albums/3014569/|publisher=Amoeba Music|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;"and two dance tracks, "All Falls Down&lt;ref name="All Falls Down"&gt;{{cite web|title=All Falls Down|url=http://www.amoeba.com/all-falls-down-sonika/albums/3014571/|publisher=Amoeba Music|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;" and "Only Girl&lt;ref name="Only Girl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Only Girl|url=http://www.amoeba.com/only-girl-sonika/albums/3018433/|publisher=Amoeba Music|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;", as Sonika moved more in the direction of R&amp;B/[[Pop music|Pop]].

== Artistry ==

=== Music and Voice ===
Sonika’s vocal range has been referred to by her vocal coach, Ken Tamplin,&lt;ref name="Ken Tamplin's association with Sonika"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ken Tamplin's association with Sonika|url=http://www.bloglovin.com/frame?post=1128643851&amp;group=0&amp;frame_type=b&amp;blog=7345475&amp;link=aHR0cDovL2tlbnRhbXBsaW52b2NhbGFjYWRlbXkuY29tLzIwMTMvMDYvaG93LXRvLXNpbmctbGlrZS1hbm4td2lsc29uLWhlYXJ0LWFsb25lLw&amp;frame=1&amp;click=0&amp;user=0|publisher=Ken Tamplin Vocal Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; as being in the top five (5) [[percentile]] of all of his students and he has had over 10, 000 students worldwide.

Sonika tends to write lyrics that are very self-reflective, particularly her R&amp;B music. "Gone Away" reflected on her struggle to emerge unscathed from an emotionally damaging relationship,&lt;ref name='Sonika speaks of motivation for writing "Gone Away"'&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika speaks of motivation for writing "Gone Away"|url=https://soundcloud.com/sonika-mckie/sonikas-interview-with|publisher=Soundcloud|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while "Please Don’t Let It Go" focused on her overcoming negative influences and situations&lt;ref name="Sonika speaks of overcoming negative situations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika speaks of overcoming negative situations|url=https://soundcloud.com/sonika-mckie/sonika-interviews-with|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve her dreams. Pop music, however, allows Sonika to explore her fun, daring side in songs such as "All Falls Down" and "Only Girl", which are bolder, exude more confidence and command attention.
Sonika prefers that the songs she writes and/or performs reflect something meaningful about her and her life experience,&lt;ref name="Basis for Sonika's music"&gt;{{cite web|title=Basis for Sonika's music|url=https://soundcloud.com/sonika-mckie/sonika-interviews-with|publisher=Soundcloud|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; tell a story or allow her to be expressive and immersed in the mood of the song.

=== Videos and stage ===
{{Double image|left|Mariah_Carey_1990.jpg|100|Whitney_Houston_Welcome_Home_Heroes_1_cropped.jpg|120|Mariah (''left'') and Whitney Houston (''right'') are two of Sonika's biggest influences.}}
Sonika has released one original video&lt;ref name='Release of one video for original song "Gone Away"'&gt;{{cite web|title=Release of one video for original song "Gone Away"|url=http://keepinbeat.com/music-video-premiere-sonika-gone-away|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for her first single "Gone Away". The video concept was developed by Anvar and Samuel Ogilvie, who also did the storyboard.  The videography on the video was done by Darryl Friday, assisted by Anvar and Ogilvie. Anvar custom built a makeshift dolly to get dolly-in (forward) and dolly-out (backward) shots, creating the first video in Grenada to employ the technique, which, due to lack of the proper equipment, hadn’t been attempted before.  The video was done on a zero budget with sponsors providing the wardrobe and other assistance. The project depended on such Corporate Sponsors as the owners of the Mt. Hartman Bay Estate,&lt;ref name="Mt. Hartman Bay Estate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mt. Hartman Bay Estate|url=http://www.mounthartmanbay.com/hotel-overview.html|publisher=Mt. Hartman Bay Estate|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a high profile, private resort in Grenada, which is frequented by well-known actors and other celebrities.&lt;ref name="Mt.

Hartman Bay Estate frequented by celebrities|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/dwainthomas/7002182190/|publisher=Flickr|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video for "Gone Away&lt;ref name="Gone Away at #1 on Tempo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gone Away at #1 on Tempo|url=http://keepinbeat.com/gone-away-tops-cross-caribbean-countdown|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;" was submitted to TEMPO and became popular on that network, allowing it to rise to and remain at #1 for eight (8) consecutive weeks, on the TEMPO Cross Caribbean Countdown&lt;ref name="Tempo Cross Caribbean Countdown"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tempo Cross Caribbean Countdown|url=http://www.gottempo.com/home/shows/ccc.php|publisher=TEMPO|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charts. No other Grenadian artist had previously achieved that, with Josh Berkeley (Josh Mathurine) being the only other Grenadian artist to reach #1 on TEMPO, with the Metronome Records produced video for, his self-penned song, "Never Meant",&lt;ref name="Article about Never Meant by Josh Berlkeley"&gt;{{cite web|title=Article about Never Meant by Josh Berkeley|url=http://www.barnaclegrenada.com/index.php/featured-stories/2063-josh-berkeleys-never-meant-is-now-1-|publisher=barnaclegrenada.com|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from his first album, ''Ready for Whatever&lt;ref name="Article about Ready for Whatever"&gt;{{cite web|title=Article about Ready for Whatever|url=http://keepinbeat.com/ready-for-whatever|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.

Sonika’s second music video, for "Please Don’t Let It Go", was conceptualized and storyboarded by Ogilvie and filmed by Ogilvie and Anvar. This video is in pre-release&lt;ref name="Please Don't Let It Go in pre-release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Please Don't Let It Go in pre-release|url=http://auxmusicproductions.com/2013/04/30/artist-profile-sonika/|publisher=AuX Music Productions|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to be available in the last quarter of 2013.

Sonika’s first appearance on stage came when she participated in and won Grenada’s Talent Search in 2003,&lt;ref name="Sonika as Winner of Grenada Talent Search 2003"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika as Winner of Grenada Talent Search 2003|url=http://www.spicevibes.com/index.php/lit-arts/34-literature-and-arts/artists/69-sonika|publisher=Spice Vibes|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with her rendition of Whitney Houston’s [[Run to You (Whitney Houston song)|Run to You]]. Following that, Sonika participated in local and regional Karaoke and singing competitions.&lt;ref name="Sonika participated in Karoake competitions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika participated in Karoake competitions|url=http://thecaribbeancurrent.com/grenaian-r-b-sensation-sonika-mckie/|publisher=The Caribbean Current|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also participated in the GBN Gospel Challenge&lt;ref name="Gospel Challenge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gospel Challenge|url=http://vidgrids.com/gbn-gospel-challenge|publisher=Vidgrids|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 and the Grenada Best Talent Competition in June, 2010.  Since the release of "Please Don’t Let it Go", Sonika has been a regularly booked local act, at events seeking popular artists.

Sonika had two international performances in 2013, first at the CONCACAF gala event&lt;ref name="Sonika performs at CONCACAF event"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika performs at CONCACAF event|url=http://keepinbeat.com/sonika-gold-cup|publisher=Metronome Records|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and shortly after, in [[Suriname]] for CARIFESTA XI.

Sonika has maintained an understated, classy image that has attracted a wide demographic, from the very young fans to adults who appreciate the depth of her lyrics in songs like Please Don’t Let It Go.&lt;ref name="References to image and fans in interview with lexan Fletcher"&gt;{{cite web|title=References to image and fans in interview with lexan Fletcher|url=https://soundcloud.com/sonika-mckie/chit-chat-with-sonika-mckie|publisher=soundcloud|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a considerable fan base &lt;ref name="Revernation statistical reference for fan base"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revernation statistical reference for fan base|url=http://www.reverbnation.com/sonymc|publisher=Reverbnation|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; locally, regionally and is developing her international fan base.

In re-defining her music, Sonika is also making changes in her personal style, but maintains an image that will allow her to command respect.

== Legacy &amp; Influence ==
In her 2012 interview with Converse Caribe,&lt;ref name="Interview with Converse Caribe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Converse Caribe|url=http://vidgrids.com/grenadian-rb-singer|publisher=Vidgrids|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonika stated that it was not always an easy road to becoming confident in her ability and overcoming self-image insecurities, as a young woman. She believes that being around positive people, believing in oneself – no matter what – and working hard at achieving one’s goals eventually pays off. Sonika therefore sees her story as a reference point for other young people and artists to draw on, in overcoming their struggles to develop personally and professionally.

== Personal life ==
Sonika was born to Judyann Mckie and Joseph Hurst on October 21, 1988, in the small village of Willis, New Hampshire, [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George’s]], where she grew up. She had a bittersweet childhood.&lt;ref name="Sonika on Converse Caribe talks about early life"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonika on Converse Caribe talks about early life|url=https://soundcloud.com/sonika-mckie/sonika-interviews-with|publisher=Soundcloud|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her memories of that time are full of fun and laughter, they were also marred by mean-spirited jibes and insults. Sonika was told ceaselessly that she was ugly and would always be ugly, even into her teenage years. The fact that she was often seen in Market Square helping her mother sell produce only gave her detractors more fuel to add to the fire. This did not do wonders for her self-esteem, and other strained relationships within the family placed an emotional burden on her.

At school she performed at her high school's (Wesley College) talent shows, and dabbled in sports as well, earning a [[Netball]] [[MVP]] award. It was also around this time that she left her mother's care to stay with her grandmother. In spite of having to deal with many changes, Sonika graduated from high school and enrolled in the T.A. Marryshow Community College&lt;ref name="T.A. Marryshow Community College"&gt;{{cite web|title=T.A. Marryshow Community College|url=http://www.tamcc.edu.gd/|publisher=T.A. Marryshow Community College|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;'s (TAMCC) secretarial program. In 2007, the same year that she had to move again, Sonika discovered that she was about to become a mom. At this time she was still attending TAMCC. She managed to graduate in 2008 with a 3.45 [[GPA]], at the top of her class and have a healthy baby girl, whom she named Akia.

Shortly after Akia’s birth, Akia’s father left Grenada to pursue a military career in the [[United Kingdom]], which led to another difficult period. Regardless, Sonika managed to move on.

Today Sonika is living on her own and raising her daughter, while pursuing her [[music career]].

==Origin==
The '''Soundings''' [[podcast]] was started in 2013 by [[Dylan Haskins]], a broadcaster and producer, and singer-songwriter [[Lisa Hannigan]]. The podcast revolves around Hannigan and Haskin's, two Irish expats living in London, reactions to the various “culture, books, music, theatre, films and other weird things that happen."[5] Although each episode the hosts, sometimes joined by guests, discussed their opinions on recent books, films, exhibitions and plays, from the onset Haskins was clear that the Soundings was not a review show stating that '''“People make art to express their ideas and provoke thought and conversation, which is what this show is all about."'''[6] The name Soundings was chosen by Hannigan as a nod to a Leaving Certificate poetry book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hannigan|first1=Lisa|last2=Haskins|first2=Dylan|title=Soundings 1: Blue is the Warmest Colour, Paul Muldoon's rock lyrics and Subcultures Exhibition|website=Soundings podcast|accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The show quickly won fans for its relaxed style and the chemistry between its co-hosts. As well as discussing current cultural topics the show also featured segments including the "Education of Dylan Haskins" where Hannigan introduced Haskins to a selection of classic films, and the Desensitization of Lisa Hannigan where they sought to test the nerves of the usually skittish Hannigan through a series of tests, including a visit to [[Chislehurst Caves]].

From [[Logroño]] goes through the kingdoms of Castile and León, ending in [[Santiago de Compostela]]. The Cantabrian branch is diverted to pass through [[Oviedo]], route coined one of the first tourist slogans. "Who go to Santiago and not see The Savior, visits the servant and forgets the lord".]]

'''Spanish Romanesque''' to designate the spatial division of the [[Romanesque art]] corresponding to [[Chronology of the kingdoms on the Iberian peninsula|Hispanic-Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula]] in the 11th and 12th centuries. However, its stylistic features are essentially common to the European Romanesque, and in the particular differentiated between areas that usually subdivided. The southern half of the peninsula lacks of Romanesque art since remained under Muslim rule ([[Hispanic-muslim art|Andalusi art]]). The Romanesque in the central area of the peninsula is low and late, with virtually no presence at south of the Ebro and the Tagus; It is the northern third peninsular the area where are concentrated the Romanesque buildings. In view of the fact that the Romanesque is introduced into the peninsula from east to west, for the purposes of its study, the regional delimitation is done in the same direction: in "eastern kingdoms" (the kingdoms or Pyrenean areas: Catalan Romanesque, Aragonese Romanesque and Navarrese Romanesque), and "western kingdoms" (Castilian-Leonese Romanesque, Asturian Romanesque, Galician Romanesque and Portuguese Romanesque).

The [[First Romanesque]] or Lombard Romanesque has especially presence in Catalonia, while the full Romanesque spread from the foundations of the [[Cluniac Reforms|Order of Cluny]] along the axis of [[Camino de Santiago]]. The late-romanesque continues in the 13th century, especially in rural buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonio Fernández (historian)|Antonio Fernández]], [[Emilio Barnechea]] and [[Juan Haro]], ''History of Art'', Barcelona: Vicens-Vives, 1992, {{ISBN|9788431625542}}, cp. 9, pg. 145-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[File:Iglesia de Santa Maria de Eunate.jpg|thumb|left|[[Santa María de Eunate]].]]
[[File:SanIsidoroLeóninterior.jpg|thumb|Lateral nave (with edge vaults) and central nave (barrel vault) of the church of San Isidoro de León (left, startup of lobed arch of transept).]]
{{Main|Romanesque architecture in Spain}}

From the 11th century the European artistic influence (especially Burgundian - [[Monastery of Cluny|Cluny]] - and [[First Romanesque|Lombard monasteries]] - [[Lombard arch]]es -)  was superimposed on local artistic traditions ( called as "[[Pre-Romanesque]] - [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic art]], [[Asturian architecture|Asturian art]], [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic art]] or [[Repoblación art and architecture|Repoblación art]]) and [[Hispanic muslim art|Andalusi art]] or Hispanic Muslim) and lived with the so-called [[Mudéjar]] Romanesque (or "Romanesque of brick", dominant in some areas, such as the center of the Northern Plateau -from Sahagún to Cuéllar-, Toledo or Teruel) giving rise to an art of strong personality.

The chronology in the penetration of architectural forms is visible in a display from east to west, being the first examples in Catalonia ([[Sant Pere de Rodes]], 1022) and developed around [[Camino de Santiago]] those of Aragon ([[Jaca Cathedral|Cathedral of Jaca]], from 1054), Navarre ([[Monastery of Leyre|Leire]], 1057), Castile ([[San Martín de Tours, Fromista|San Martin de Frómista]], 1066) and Leon ([[Basilica of San Isidoro|San Isidoro]] -portico of 1067), ending in Galicia, where it raised the most outstanding work: the [[cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]] (begun in 1075 with the plant of pilgrimage characteristic of most of the churches of the Way, from that of [[Basilica of St. Sernin, Toulouse|St. Sernin of Toulouse]]). The 12th century was the culmination of the style ([[Santa Maria de Ripoll|Monastery of Ripoll]], [[Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Boí|churches of Boí and Taüll]] -in Catalonia-, [[Loarre Castle|Castle of Loarre]], [[San Juan de la Peña|Monastery of San Juan de la Peña]] -in Aragon, [[Palacio de los Reyes de Navarra, Estella|Palace of the Kings of Navarre (Estella)]], [[Done Mikel eliza (Estella-Lizarra)]], [[Church of Saint Mary of Eunate|Saint Mary of Eunate]], [[San Pedro, Olite|Saint Peter of Olite]] -in Navarre-, Segovian arcaded churches, [[Santo Domingo, Soria|Santo Domingo (Soria)]], [[Monastery of San Juan de Duero|San Juan de Duero]] -in Castile-, [[Cathedral of Zamora]], [[Old Cathedral of Salamanca]] -in Leon-). From the late 12th is identified the transition from Romanesque to Gothic ([[Cathedral of Tarragona]], [[La Seu Vella, Lleida|La Seu Vella (Lleida)]]).&lt;ref&gt;Juan Haro, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Few, but notable are the churches of central plant, which are often associated with models of the Holy Land brought by the military orders (Eunate in Navarre, Vera Cruz in Segovia).&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Gallego, ''Historia del Arte'', Editex, 2009, pg. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Detalle de un capitel del claustro del Monasterio de San Juan de la Penna.jpg|thumb|left|Cloister of [[San Juan de la Peña|Monastery of San Juan de la Peña]].]]

The earliest works of the [[Romanesque sculpture]] in the Hispanic-Christian peninsular kingdoms are two beam of the Roussillon area [[Saint-Génis-des-Fontaines]] (dated in 1020)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/v2/obras/19878.htm Ficha en Artehistoria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214001659/http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/v2/obras/19878.htm |date=2013-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Monastery of Sant Andreu de Sureda|Sant Andreu de Sureda]] (which plays its forms). Also from the 11th century are the tympanum of the [[Cathedral of Jaca]], the gables of [[Basilica of San Isidoro|San Isidoro (León)]], the Facade of Pratarías of [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]  (the [[Master Esteban]]), the  cloister of [[Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos|Santo Domingo de Silos]]. In the 12th century emphasizes the facades of [[Santa Maria de Ripoll]], of the [[Church of Santa María la Real, Sangüesa|Andre Maria erreginaren eliza]] (Zangoza/Sangüesa) of the [[Abbey of San Pedro el Viejo|San Pedro el Viejo]] (Huesca) and the cloister of [[San Juan de la Peña|Monastery of San Juan de la Peña]]. In the late 12th century belong the facades of the [[Church of Santa María del Camino (Carrión de los Condes)]] and [[Santo Domingo, Soria|Santo Domingo (Soria)]]. In some works of this period is visible the transition to [[Gothic sculpture|Gothic]]: the apostolate of the [[Cámara Santa|Cámara Santa (Oviedo)]], the facade of [[San Vicente, Ávila|San Vicente (Ávila)]] and [[Portico of Glory]] of Cathedral of Santiago de Cosmpostela (of [[Master Mateo]]).&lt;ref&gt;Juan Haro, op. cit.; Raquel Gallego, ''op. cit.'', pg. 189 y ss.&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the early sculptors of known name is [[Arnau Cadell]] (capitals of the cloister of [[Monastery of Sant Cugat|Sant Cugat]]).

[[File:Pórtico de la Gloria (66231651).jpg|thumb|center|400px|Portico of Glory.]]

The carvings in the round bulge that have been preserved, in polychrome wood, usually have as theme the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ crucified]] in the type called ''[[Majesty (crucifix)|Majesty]]'' and the [[Madonna with Child]] in the type called ''[[Seat of Wisdom|sedes sapientiae]]'' ("Seat of Wisdom"). An exceptional sculpture complex is the ''[[Davallament of Sant Joan de les Abadesses]]'', of transition to the Gothic.&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Gallego, ''op. cit'', pg. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish Romanesque frescoes are outstanding: Pantheon of the Kings of San Isidoro (León) retained 'in situ', or the torn from its places of origin ([[San Baudelio de Berlanga]], [[hermitage of la Vera Cruz (Maderuelo)]] -both in the [[Prado]]- and the collection assembled in the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Juan Haro, ``op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:12th-century unknown painters - Creation Adam and the Original Sin - WGA19757.jpg|thumb|centre|500px|Creation of Adam and Original Sin. Hermitage of la Vera Cruz (Maderuelo).]]

The panel painting produced [[antependium]] that, especially in Catalonia collected the Italian-Byzantine influence from the 12th century (''[[Altar frontal from La Seu d'Urgell or of The Apostles]]''). In later period it evolves to the [[Gothic painting]], of higher capacity narrative and lower stiffness (''[[Altar frontal from Avià]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Gallego, op. cit.'', pg. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Sumptuary arts==

The preparation of manuscripts in the ''[[scriptorium]]'' of monasteries and cathedrals was an out-standing activity, continuing the Mozárabe tradition (Beatus) and incorporating the European influences (''[[Libro de los testamentos]]'', ''[[Tumbos compostelanos]]'', ''[[Codex Calixtinus]]'', etc.) have been retained some outstanding examples of tissues in liturgical vestments and tapestries (''[[Tapestry of Creation]]'' of the Cathedral of Girona) The [[Ivory carving]], of Andalusian influence, played an important workshop at the Leonese court. The [[goldsmith]] produced rich pieces (''[[Cáliz de las Ágatas]] '' or of Doña Urraca -ca 1063-,&lt;ref&gt;[http://domuspucelae.blogspot.com.es/2010/07/visita-virtual-el-caliz-de-dona-urraca.html Virtual tour: THE GOBLET OF DOÑA URRACA, pious donation of the Queen of Zamora]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ark of San Isidoro]]''), including the incorporation of the technique of the [[Limoges enamels]] (''[[Frontal of Santo Domingo de Silos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Gallego, ''op. cit.'', pg. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SubtractiveColor.svg|thumb|Subtractive color mixing]]
[[File:Duhauron1877.jpg|thumb|200px|An 1877 color photo by [[Louis Ducos du Hauron]], a French pioneer of [[color photography]]. The overlapping subtractive yellow, cyan and red (magenta) image elements can be seen clearly along the edges of the image.]]
A '''subtractive color''' model explains the mixing of a limited set of [[dye]]s, [[ink]]s, [[paint]] [[pigment]]s or natural colorants to create a wider range of [[color]]s, each the result of partially or completely subtracting (that is, absorbing) some wavelengths of [[light]] and not others. The color that a surface displays depends on which parts of the [[visible spectrum]] are not absorbed and therefore remain visible.

Subtractive color systems start with light, presumably white light. Colored inks, paints, or filters between the watchers and the light source or reflective surface ''subtract'' wavelengths from the light, giving it color.  If the incident light is other than white, our visual mechanisms are able to compensate well, but not perfectly, often giving a flawed impression of the "true" color of the surface.

Conversely, [[additive color]] systems start with darkness. Light sources of various wavelengths are added in various proportions to produce a range of colors. Usually, three [[primary color]]s are combined to stimulate humans’ [[trichromatic]] [[color vision]], sensed by the three types of [[cone cell]]s in the eye, giving an apparently full range.

== RGB ==
[[File:Rueda de colores.png|thumb|left|Standard RYB Color Wheel]]
{{main|RYB color model}}

RGB (Red, green, Blue) is the formerly standard set of subtractive primary colors used for mixing pigments. It is used in art and art education, particularly in [[painting]]. It predated modern scientific [[color theory]].

Red, yellow, and blue are the primary colors of the standard [[color wheel|color "wheel"]].  The secondary colors, violet (or purple), orange, and green (VOG) make up another triad, formed by mixing equal amounts of red and blue, red and yellow, and blue and yellow, respectively.

[[File:Pigment Colours - Classification.jpg|thumb|Classification of pigment colors]]

The RYB primary colors became the foundation of 18th century theories of color vision as the fundamental sensory qualities blended in the perception of all physical colors and equally in the physical mixture of pigments or dyes. These theories were enhanced by 18th-century investigations of a variety of purely psychological color effects, in particular the contrast between "complementary" or opposing hues produced by color afterimages and in the contrasting shadows in colored light. These ideas and many personal color observations were summarized in two founding documents in color theory: the ''[[Theory of Colors]]'' (1810) by the German poet and government minister [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], and ''The Law of Simultaneous Color Contrast'' (1839) by the French industrial chemist [[Michel-Eugène Chevreul]].

In late 19th and early to mid-20th century commercial printing, use of the traditional RYB terminology persisted even though the more versatile CMY (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) triad had been adopted, with the cyan sometimes referred to as "process blue" and the magenta as "process red".

== CMY and CMYK printing processes ==
{{main|CMYK color model}}

In [[color printing]], the usual primary colors are [[cyan]], [[magenta]] and [[yellow]] (CMY). Cyan is the complement of red, meaning that the cyan serves as a filter that absorbs red. The amount of cyan applied to a white sheet of paper controls how much of the red in white light will be reflected back from the paper. Ideally, the cyan is completely transparent to green and blue light and has no effect on those parts of the [[visible spectrum|spectrum]]. Magenta is the complement of [[green]], and yellow the complement of [[blue]]. Combinations of different amounts of the three can produce a wide range of colors with good [[saturation (color theory)|saturation]].

In [[inkjet printing|inkjet color printing]] and typical [[mass production]] [[lithography|photomechanical printing processes]], a black ink K (Key) component is included, resulting in the [[CMYK color model]]. The black ink serves to cover unwanted tints in dark areas of the printed image, which result from the imperfect transparency of commercially practical CMY inks; to improve image sharpness, which tends to be degraded by imperfect registration of the three color elements; and to reduce or eliminate consumption of the more expensive color inks where only black or gray is required.

Purely [[color photography|photographic color processes]] almost never include a K component, because in all common processes the CMY dyes used are much more perfectly transparent, there are no registration errors to camouflage, and substituting a black dye for a saturated CMY combination, a trivial prospective cost benefit at best, is technologically impractical in non-electronic [[analog photography]].

[[File:'The feast of reason, and the flow of soul,' - ie - the wits of the age, setting the table in a roar by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|right|300px|As [[James Gillray]], the artist of this 1797 etching, died in 1815, his works are in the [[public domain]] throughout the world. However, under the "sweat of the brow" doctrine, new copyright claims could be made over mechanical reproductions of the etching, due to the skill and labor involved in the reproduction.]]

'''Sweat of the brow''' is an [[intellectual property]] [[Legal doctrine|law doctrine]], chiefly related to [[copyright]] law. According to this doctrine, an [[author]] gains rights through  simple diligence during the creation of a work, such as a database, or a directory. Substantial creativity or "originality" is not required.

Under a "sweat of the brow" doctrine, the creator of a copyrighted work, even if it is completely unoriginal, is entitled to have his effort and expense protected, and no one else may use such a work without permission, but must instead recreate the work by independent research or effort. The classic example is a [[telephone directory]]. In a "sweat of the brow" jurisdiction, such a directory may not be copied, but instead a competitor must independently collect the information to issue a competing directory. The same rule generally applies to databases and lists of facts.

[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] jurisdictions have traditionally used the similar but not identical concept of ''[[droit d'auteur]]''. [[European Union law]] tends to harmonize the protection of intellectual property throughout member states and the doctrine thus gains more influence. In the Databases Directive 96/9/EC{{emdash}}the [[Member State of the European Union|member states of the EU]] are obliged to confer protection known as the [[database right]] on non-original databases, that is on those that embody no creativity, but are a consequence of substantial investment (financial, labour etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonnanwalt.de/rg/internet/law/eu/RiLi96-9-eg.html EU Richtlinie 96/9/EG] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621055429/http://www.bonnanwalt.de/rg/internet/law/eu/RiLi96-9-eg.html |date=2007-06-21 }} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In a traditional [[English language|English]] [[idiom]], the ''sweat of one's brow'' refers to the effort expended in labor, and the value created thereby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.page.sh?page=1457|page=1457|accessdate=2007-05-30|work=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913 ed)|title=Sweat, v. t.|publisher=ARTFL Project|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303004057/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.page.sh?page=1457|archivedate=2006-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is famously used in English translations of {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Genesis|chapter=3|verse=19}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newlivingtranslation.com/05discoverthenlt/ssresults.asp?txtSearchString=Genesis+3|accessdate=2007-05-30|title=New Living Translation|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers, inc.|quote=By the sweat of your brow will you have food to eat}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law doctrine takes its name from this idiom.

==By country==

===United States===
{{see also|Copyright law in the United States}}
The [[United States]] rejected this doctrine in the 1991 [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|499|340|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; until then it had been upheld in a number of US copyright cases.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Under the ''Feist'' ruling in the US, mere collections of facts are considered unoriginal and thus not protected by copyright, no matter how much work went into [[collation|collating]] them. The arrangement and presentation of a collection may be original, but not if it is "simple and obvious" such as a list in [[alphabetical]] or [[chronological]] order.

===United Kingdom===
Under the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]], for copyright to subsist in a work, that work must be original. However, courts have not adopted a literal reading of this requirement. For over a hundred years, English courts have held that a significant expenditure of labour is sufficient. The consequence of this is that if A makes a work, in which copyright subsists, and B subsequently adds his skill, judgement and labour, altering the form of A's work, B will potentially have a copyright in the work he produces. This suggests that copyright is not about protecting ideas, because one can acquire a copyright by expending skill, labour, and judgement, but no creativity or inventiveness.

However, in March 2012, a case was taken to the [[European Court of Justice]], in which [[Football DataCo]] claimed [[copyright infringement]] over web sites which were reproducing match schedules from several major [[association football|football]] leagues. Football DataCo asserted that these schedules were copyrighted works due to the skill and labour involved in their preparation, and that the company was given exclusive rights to license their reproduction. Based on its interpretation of British law, the court rejected the notion that labour and skill was enough to grant protection to a work, since "unless the procedures for creating the lists concerned as described by the national court are supplemented by elements reflecting originality in the selection or arrangement of the data contained in those lists, they do not suffice for those lists to be protected by the copyright laid down in the directive."&lt;ref name=bbcn-dataco&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Bill|title=Football match fixture list copyright claim rejected|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17218968|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a copyright notice on 'digital images, photographs and the internet' last updated in November 2015, the UK [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|Intellectual Property Office]] confirmed that digital reproductions of [[public domain]] images are not protected by copyright, arguing that "according to the Court of Justice of the European Union which has effect in UK law, copyright can only subsist in subject matter that is original in the sense that it is the author’s own ‘intellectual creation’. Given this criterion, it seems unlikely that what is merely a retouched, digitised image of an older work can be considered as ‘original’."&lt;ref name=IPO-cnote&gt;{{cite web|author=UK Intellectual Property Office|title=Copyright Notice: digital images, photographs and the internet|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/481194/c-notice-201401.pdf|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
In ''[[Walter v Lane]]'' (1900) (Pre-CDPA), reporters took shorthand notes of a speech, punctuated them, etc. and published them in the [[The Times|''Times'']] newspaper. The court held that the reporters were authors of the published speech, and, as such, owned a copyright in the published speeches, because of the considerable skill, labour, and judgement they exercised.

In ''[[University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;University of London Press v University Tutorial [1916] 2 Ch 601&lt;/ref&gt; the question arose as to whether certain mathematics exam papers were original literary works. The exam papers just consisted of conventional maths problems in a conventional manner. The court held that originality does not mean that the work must be an expression of individual thought. The simple fact that the authors drew on a body of knowledge common to mathematicians did not compromise originality. The requirement of originality, it was held, does not require that expression be in an original or novel form. It does, however, require that the work not be copied from another work. It must originate from the author.
As such, even though these were the same old maths problems every student is familiar with, and even though there was no creative input, the skill, labour, and judgement of the authors was sufficient to make the papers original literary works.

In ''[[Cummins v Bond]]'', a psychic in a trance claimed to have written down what spirits told her, through a process of [[automatic writing]]. In court, she accepted that she was not the creative author of the writing. The creative input, had, presumably, come from the spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Patry |url=http://williampatry.blogspot.gr/2005/08/authorship-and-religion.html |title=The Patry Copyright Blog: Authorship and Religion |publisher=Williampatry.blogspot.gr |date=2005-08-10 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the court held that she had exercised sufficient labour and skill in translating and transcribing what the spirits told her, so she had a copyright in the resulting literary work.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Germany===
In certain cases, German law grants ancillary copyrights (''Leistungsschutzrecht'') due to the effort involved in the production or exploitation of creative works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nolte|first1=Georg|title=Zur Forderung der Presseverleger nach Einführung eines speziellen Leistungsschutzrechts: Eine kritische Auseinandersetzung|journal=Zeitschrift für Geistiges Eigentum|date=1 July 2010|volume=2|issue=2|pages=165–195|doi=10.1628/186723710792175149|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mohr/zge/2010/00000002/00000002/art00002|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a [[Landgericht Berlin|regional court in Berlin]] ruled that digitized versions of public domain paintings were entitled to new copyrights due to the effort and expertise necessary to create the reproductions. The case is being appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moody|first1=Glyn|title=Digitising public domain images creates a new copyright, rules German court [Updated]|url=http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/06/digitising-public-domain-images-creates-a-new-copyright-germany/|website=Ars Technica UK|accessdate=5 July 2016|date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Reiss-Engelhorn Museum (REM) of the City of Mannheim v.

===Israel===
Israeli law requires that a work exhibit some [[threshold of originality|degree of originality]] in order to be copyrightable. In other words, Israeli law does not subscribe to the "sweat of the brow" doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Tempska, Urzula (2002). [http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&amp;context=iplr "'Originality' After the Dead Sea Scrolls Decision: Implications for the American Law of Copyright"]. ''Marquette Intellectual Property Law Review'' '''6''' (1): 132.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the amount of originality required is minimal, and the transliteration or interpretation of an artifact is covered by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin-Koren, Niva (2001). [http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/38-2_pdf/HLR38P445.pdf "Of Scientific Claims and Proprietary Rights: Lessons from the Dead Sea Scrolls"], ''Houston Law Review'' '''38''' (2): 458, 460.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uruguay===
Uruguayan law requires that the work should have some degree of originality to be protected by copyright. Uruguayan law, therefore, does not subscribe to the sweat of the brow doctrine.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

'''Takyeh''' ({{lang-az|Təkiyə}}) is a historical monument of the 13th century. It is a part of [[Old City (Baku)|Old City]] and located on Gazi Muhammed street, in the city of [[Baku]], in [[Azerbaijan]]. The building was also registered as a national architectural monument by the decision of the [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan|Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan]] dated August 2, 2001, No. 132.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azərbaycan Respublikası ərazisində dövlət mühafizəsinə götürülmüş daşınmaz tarix və mədəniyyət abidələrinin əhəmiyyət dərəcələrinə görə bölgüsünün təsdiq edilməsi haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikasi Nazirlər Kabinetinin qərarı|url=http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/2847|website=e-qanun.az|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The monument was built in XIII century. It mainly operated as [[mahallah]] mosque,&lt;ref name="icherisheher"/&gt; and also as secondary school.&lt;ref name="icherisheheraz"&gt;{{cite web|title= Təkiyə|url= http://www.icherisheher.az/az/70-dini-abideler|publisher= www.icherisheher.az|language= az|accessdate= 6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, archeological excavations were conducted around the takyeh. It was restored in 1970s.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"&gt;{{cite web|title= TƏKİYƏ|url= http://www.icherisheher.gov.az/static,20/lang,az/#monument33|publisher= icherisheher.gov.az|language= az|accessdate= 6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gomap"&gt;{{cite web|title= Təkiyə (dərvişlərin ibadət etdiyi yer)|url= https://kataloq.gomap.az/az/all-poi/culture/sanctuary/96fe93a4d56611e0ad4900226424597d|publisher= kataloq.gomap.az|language= az|accessdate= 6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dervish]]es were spiritually purified, performing individual and mass religious rituals here. [[Takyeh]]s were also a shelter for traveling strangers.&lt;ref name="icherisheheraz"/&gt;

==Architectural features==
The monument is square-shaped and consists of a single room. Its facade is towards the [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]]. Unusual plan of the takyeh, as well as covering of the worshipping room with stepped domes system resulted with specificity of the interior of the monument.

'''''The Bay Lights''''' is a [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] monumental light sculpture and [[generative art]] installation on the western span of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]], designed to commemorate the 75th&amp;nbsp;anniversary of its opening. The installation by light artist [[Leo Villareal]] includes 25,000 individual white [[Led|LEDs]] along {{convert|1.8|mi}} of the cables on the north side of the suspension span of the bridge between [[Yerba Buena Island]] and [[San Francisco]]. The installation is controlled via a computer and displays changing patterns that are not meant to repeat. The opening ceremony was held on March&amp;nbsp;5, 2013.

Initially intended as a temporary installation, which ended on March&amp;nbsp;5, 2015, the project was re-installed as a longstanding feature of the Bay Bridge with permanent fixtures that were re-lit on January&amp;nbsp;30, 2016.

==Origin==
''The Bay Lights'' was conceived in September 2010 by Ben Davis of Words Pictures Ideas, a public relations company that has a contract with the [[Caltrans|California Department of Transportation]] (Caltrans) for publicizing the construction of the [[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|new eastern span replacement]] of the [[San Francisco Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] between Yerba Buena Island and Oakland.&lt;ref name="whiting"&gt;{{cite news |last=Whiting|first=Sam |title=Bay Bridge to beam vivid light sculpture |url= http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Bay-Bridge-to-beam-vivid-light-sculpture-3872898.php |accessdate=18 January 2013 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis characterized the Bay Bridge as being overshadowed by the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], which is a popular tourist destination for visitors to San Francisco, and he hoped this art project would give the Bay Bridge more recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McMenamin|first=Dan |title=Art project to illuminate Bay Bridge |url= http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2012/09/art-project-illuminate-bay-bridge |accessdate=19 January 2013 |newspaper=Bay City News via [[San Francisco Examiner]] |date=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Davis contacted light artist Leo Villareal, who had an exhibition on display at the [[San Jose Museum of Art]] in late 2010.&lt;ref name="whiting"/&gt;  Davis later founded [[Illuminate the Arts]], a non-profit organization, to organize the sculpture's design, engineering, and fundraising.

Both Davis and Villareal suggest ''The Bay Lights'' was influenced by their experiences at the annual [[Burning Man]] art and music festival in northwestern [[Nevada]].  Villareal first attended Burning Man in 1994 and eventually joined the board of directors of the Burning Man organization. His prototype light sculpture was 16 blinking lights in a grid that was meant to be a beacon when returning to his camp at night.&lt;ref name="fischer"/&gt;  From there, Villareal has programmed more complex light matrices and exhibitions, including his largest, "Multiverse," a 41,000 LED installation on permanent display at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref name="whiting"/&gt;

==Operations==

The sculpture is visible mostly from the north side of the bridge and is most easily seen from the San Francisco waterfront. The lights are positioned to be invisible to bridge motorists, to prevent driver distractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cuff|first=Dennis |title=25,000 lights to turn Bay Bridge span into giant night sculpture |url= http://www.contracostatimes.com/breaking-news/ci_22269815/25-000-lights-turn-bay-bridge-span-into? |accessdate=18 January 2013 |newspaper=[[Contra Costa Times]] |date=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The installation operates from dusk until dawn daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2013/10/16/the-bay-lights-led-sculpture-to-extend-hours-in-november/ |title=The Bay Lights LED Sculpture To Extend Hours In November |date=October 16, 2013 |work=Bay City News Service |publisher=KPIX-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
The 25,000 white [[LED]]s were attached by construction workers along the vertical steel support cables that connect the deck of the bridge to the suspension cables at the top. Caltrans workers intermittently closed a lane of traffic on the bridge late at night so electricians could install the individual LEDs to the cables.&lt;ref name="fischer"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fischer|first=Adam |title=Bright Idea |url= http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/bright-idea/ |accessdate=18 January 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="musiker"&gt;{{cite news |last=Musiker|first=Cy |title=Bay Bridge Lightshow on Schedule For March Debut |url= http://www.kqed.org/news/story/2012/12/07/112375/bay_bridge_lighting_project_on_schedule_for_march?category=bay+area |accessdate=19 January 2013 |publisher=[[KQED]] |date=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lights are programmed to create a series of abstract patterns that ascend and descend the cables and appear to cross the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kuang|first=Cliff |title=Big-Time Techies Want To Turn SF’s Bay Bridge Into A Glittering Light Show |url= http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670002/big-time-techies-want-to-turn-sfs-bay-bridge-into-a-glittering-light-show |accessdate=18 January 2013 |newspaper=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |date=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villareal said the patterns will be inspired by weather patterns, tides, and the volume of traffic on the bridge at any given time.&lt;ref name="sharpe"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sharpe|first=Katherine |title=Everything Will Be Illuminated: Artist to Cover Bay Bridge in Programmable LEDs |url= https://www.wired.com/design/2012/05/bay-lights/ |accessdate=18 January 2013 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The lights need {{convert|100000|ft}} of special cabling to power the installation, as well as for networking and communications with the control computer. The lights are spaced every {{convert|12|in|cm}} and are attached to the bridge with 60,000 zip ties.&lt;ref name="fischer"/&gt;  Each LED bulb can be adjusted for 255 different levels of brightness and the entire installation is controlled remotely by a computer program operated by Villareal.&lt;ref name="whiting"/&gt; The LED lights complement the permanent string of lights that has been attached to the suspension cables since the 50th&amp;nbsp;anniversary of the bridge in 1986.&lt;ref name="whiting"/&gt;

The original, temporary installation, which formally opened on March&amp;nbsp;5, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2013/03/06/the-bay-lights-officially-unveiled-on-bay-bridge/ |title= ‘The Bay Lights’ Officially Unveiled On Bay Bridge |date= March 6, 2013 |work= |publisher= [[KPIX-TV]] |accessdate= March 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was taken down in March 2015 when its permits expired so that Caltrans could repaint and perform maintenance on the cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Bay-Lights-Project-Removed-for-Caltrans-Maintenance-on-Bay-Bridge-295077881.html |title=Bay Lights Go Dark for Caltrans Maintenance on Bay Bridge |first=Joe |last=Rosato Jr. |date=4 March 2015 |work=NBC Bay Area |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Installation of more robust, permanent lights began in October 2015, and a re-lighting ceremony was held on January 30, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Bay-Bridge-Lights-Set-to-Shine-Once-Again-6559014.php |title=Bay Lights set to shine once again |first=Douglas |last=Zimmerman |date=9 October 2015 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="egelko"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Egelko|first1=Bob|title=Bay Bridge light show will go on|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Bay-Bridge-light-show-will-go-on-5964267.php|publisher=SF Gate|accessdate=6 February 2015|date=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuff"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/breaking-news/ci_29446187/bay-bridge-light-sculpture-turns-back-saturday-night |title=Bay Bridge light sculpture turns back on Saturday night |first=Denis |last=Cuff |date=28 January 2016 |work=Bay Area News Group |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  after which the lights were gifted to the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/morning_call/2016/01/bay-lights-art-installation-bridge-tourism.html |title=Bay Lights art installation to shine again for Super Bowl 50 festivities |first=Todd |last=Johnson |date=29 January 2016 |work=San Francisco Business Times |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new lights are brighter and better able to weather the elements and angled such that they are visible from south of the bridge as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2016/01/29/the-bay-bridge-lights-return-for-an-unlimited-engagement/ |title=The Bay Bridge Lights Return for an Unlimited Engagement |first=Cy |last=Musiker |date=29 January 2016 |work=KQED |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost===
The initial project cost $8&amp;nbsp;million, which was raised through private donations and contributions.&lt;ref name="fischer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Fixes-funding-brighten-Bay-Lights-day-4602033.php |title=Fixes, funding brighten 'Bay Lights' day |first=Michael |last=Cabanatuan |date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  50&amp;nbsp;million people were estimated to see ''The Bay Lights'' by 2015,&lt;ref name="fischer"/&gt; and the project was estimated to bring up to $100&amp;nbsp;million in tourism revenue to the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="sharpe"/&gt; [[ZERO1 (nonprofit)|ZERO1]], a non-profit dedicated to bringing art and technology together, signed on as the official fiscal sponsor of the project.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.thebaylights.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/The_Bay_Lights_Press_Facts.pdf |title=The Bay Lights Press Facts Sheet |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Bay Lights'' is estimated to use approximately $30 per day in electricity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoge|first=Patrick |title=Huge Bay Bridge light project going ahead |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2012/09/bay-bridge-light-project-going-ahead.html |accessdate=18 January 2013 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Business Times]] |date=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about $11,000 annually. During the temporary installation period, these costs were covered by a private solar investment company in the form of solar credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tarantola|first=Andrew |title=Art Backers Want to Light Up The Bay Bridge |url= https://gizmodo.com/5867523/art-backers-want-to-light-up-the-bay-bridge |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Illuminate the Arts announced it was partnering with [[Tilt.com]] to sponsor a $1.2 million crowdfunding campaign to keep ''The Bay Lights'' lit until 2026.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kung|first1=Michelle|title=Let There Be Light: 40 Days to Save the Bay Lights|url=http://blog.tilt.com/let-light-40-days-save-bay-lights/|website=Tilt Blog|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the crowdfunding campaign raised less than expected, organizers focused on larger donors and ultimately raised the $4 million necessary to install long-term fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/4-million-needed-to-save-Bay-Lights-on-Bay-5841174.php |title=$4 million needed to save 'Bay Lights’ on Bay Bridge |first=John |last=King |date=23 October 2014 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Bay Area Toll Authority]], which oversees the bridge, agreed to allocate up to $250,000 per year from toll revenues for maintenance and electricity.&lt;ref name="egelko"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Since its inauguration, ''The Bay Lights'' has received widespread public support and positive reaction, as well as political support from state and local politicians, including [[Jerry Brown|Governor Jerry Brown]], [[Gavin Newsom|Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom]], [[Ed Lee (politician)|San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee]], the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] and former [[Willie Brown (politician)|San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown]].&lt;ref name="fischer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sharpe"/&gt;

''[[Hemispheres (magazine)|Hemispheres]]'' named ''The Bay Lights'' the top attraction in its 2013 "Out with the Old, In with the New" Top-25 feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Out With the Old |url= http://www.hemispheresmagazine.com/2013/01/01/out-with-the-old/ |accessdate=19 January 2013 |publisher=[[United Airlines]] |work=[[Hemispheres (magazine)|Hemispheres]] |date=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March&amp;nbsp;8, 2014, the documentary ''Impossible Light'' world premiered at the [[SXSW|SXSW Film Festival]]. The film follows the people who wished to produce ''The Bay Lights'' as they search for funding and obtain permits. The ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' felt that the documentary was a nearly seamless extraction of the evolutionary relationship between art and benefaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2014-03-12/sxsw-film-review-impossible-light/ |title=SXSW Film Review: 'Impossible Light' – |last=Winkler |first=Jeff |date=March 12, 2014 |work=Austin Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also screened as part of the 57th [[San Francisco International Film Festival]] and the [[Newport Beach Film Festival]] in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sffs.org/festival-home/attend/film-guide/impossible-light#.UzyRfq1dWjQ|title=Looking Ahead to SFIFF59|work=San Francisco Film Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://newportbeach2014.festivalgenius.com/2014/films/impossiblelight_jeremyambers_newportbeach2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Study For The Distribution Of The Eagle Standards.jpg|thumb|A study for ''The Distribution of the Eagle Standards'', by David]]
'''''The Distribution of the Eagle Standards''''' is an 1810 painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]] depicting a ceremony arranged by [[Napoleon]] after his assumption of power as emperor. In it he sought to revive the military ethos of the [[Roman empire]]. 

The event took place on December 5, 1804, three days after his coronation. Napoleon distributed "[[French Imperial Eagle|eagles]]" based on the [[aquila (Roman)|Roman aquila]] of the legions of Rome. The standards represented the regiments raised by the various [[Département in France|Departments]] of France, and were intended to institute feelings of pride and loyalty among the troops who would be the backbone of Napoleon's new regime. Napoleon gave an emotional speech in which he insisted that troops should defend the standards with their lives. In early sketches of the painting David included a winged figure of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the goddess of victory, floating over the troops, but Napoleon objected to such an unrealistic feature. He also insisted that his wife [[Josephine Beauharnais|Josephine]] be removed from the composition. He was preparing to divorce her, since she had failed to produce his heir.&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T3noLir82usC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=the+distribution+of+the+eagle+standards&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4o4bMdSCX9&amp;sig=FaJg7q6D_hj-p2z7iwn9u0mrFxI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE3reWsujbAhWEXsAKHfePCWQ4MhDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20distribution%20of%20the%20eagle%20standards&amp;f=false|title=Jacques-Louis David: New Perspectives|first=Dorothy|last=Johnson|publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1611492835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final painting depicted the moment when Napoleon blessed the standards being held out towards him. Napoleon has his arm raised in imitation of ancient "[[adlocutio]]" scenes, which depict Classical heroes addressing troops. David's composition was heavily influenced by the friezes on [[Trajan's column]].&lt;ref name=david/&gt;

'''''The River Bank (Ophelia)''''' is a 1980 painting by the English painter [[David Inshaw]]. The subject is from [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]''. It was made for a joint exhibition of the [[Brotherhood of Ruralists]], where each artist made his own interpretation of the subject. Since 2015 it belongs to the [[Victoria Art Gallery]] in [[Bath, Somerset]].

==Description==
The painting depicts an [[English landscape garden|English garden]]. In the foreground is a river, in which a drowned woman lies. Another woman is running away, holding her red, broad-brimmed hat with both hands.

The [[Victoria Art Gallery]] writes: "In ''The River Bank'' we see the contrast between the carefully ordered world of the enclosed garden and the untamed wildness of the river bank, between reason and the madness that overcame Ophelia, this tragic Shakespearean character."&lt;ref name="victoriagal"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2016-05-17|url=https://www.victoriagal.org.uk/news/david-inshaw-acquisition|title=David Inshaw Acquisition|publisher=[[Victoria Art Gallery]]|accessdate=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sujata Iyengar, professor of English at the [[University of Georgia]], wrote in the 2016 book ''Rethinking Feminism in Early Modern Studies'': "The postmodern hyperrealistic style, with vivid colors and granular detail on, for example, the petals of an [[Iris (plant)|iris]], clongates and twists the women's bodies, the clothing of the drowned girl, and the shapes of greenery in a way that makes it hard for us to know whether we are seeing Gertrude (or a ladies' maid) discovering Ophelia's corpse, or Ophelia herself in both past and present, both contemplating suicide and achieving it."&lt;ref name="iyengar"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Iyengar|first=Sujata|year=2016|chapter=Gertrude/Ophelia: Feminist Intermediality, Ekphrasis, and Tenderness in ''Hamlet''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgxqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172|editor1-last=Loomba|editor1-first=Ania|editor2-last=Sanchez|editor2-first=Melissa E.|title=Rethinking Feminism in Early Modern Studies: Gender, Race, and Sexuality|location=London; New York City|publisher=[[Routledge]]|p=172|isbn=978-1-4724-2175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Wandering Jew''''' is a 1933 British fantasy drama film produced by the [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]]-[[Twickenham Film Studios]]. It is the story of a Jew (played by [[Conrad Veidt]]) who is forced to wander the Earth for centuries because he rebuffed [[Jesus]] while he was carrying his cross.

Other cast members included a very young [[Peggy Ashcroft]], [[Francis L. Sullivan]], and [[Felix Aylmer]].

==Plot==
The plot follows the [[The Wandering Jew|eponymous character's]] epic journey. He is finally burnt at the stake by the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. As he burns, he is forgiven by God and finally allowed to die. The story bears a resemblance to the legend of the [[Flying Dutchman]].

==Portrayal of Jews==
Unlike the [[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|antisemitic propaganda film produced by the Nazis in 1940]], this film portrayed Jews in a favorable light as the victims of unjustified persecution throughout history, in the [[Spanish Inquisition]], for example. The Nazi propaganda film, by contrast, was  intended as violently anti-Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Saul|last= Friedlander|year=2008|title='The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews 1939-1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Piero della Francesca 042 Flagellation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.00|[[Piero della Francesca]], ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|The Flagellation of Christ]]''.]]
This article about '''the development of themes in Italian Renaissance painting''' is an extension to the article [[Italian Renaissance painting]], for which it provides additional pictures with commentary. The works encompassed are from [[Giotto]] in the early 14th century to [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgement]]'' of the 1530s.

The themes that preoccupied painters of the Italian Renaissance were those of both subject matter and execution- what was painted and the style in which it was painted. The artist had far more freedom of both subject and style than did a [[Medieval]] painter. Certain characteristic elements of [[Renaissance]] painting evolved a great deal during the period. These include perspective, both in terms of how it was achieved and the effect to which it was applied, and realism, particularly in the depiction of humanity, either as symbolic, portrait or narrative element.

==Themes==
The ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|Flagellation of Christ]]'' by [[Piero della Francesca]] (above) demonstrates in a single small work many of the themes of Italian Renaissance painting, both in terms of compositional elements and subject matter. Immediately apparent is Piero's mastery of perspective and light. The architectural elements, including the tiled floor which becomes more complex around the central action, combine to create two spaces. The inner space is lit by an unseen light source to which Jesus looks. Its exact location can be pinpointed mathematically by an analysis of the diffusion and the angle of the shadows on the coffered ceiling. The three figures who are standing outside are lit from a different angle, from both daylight and light reflected from the pavement and buildings.

The religious theme is tied to the present. The ruler is a portrait of the visiting Emperor of [[Constantinople|Byzantium]].&lt;ref&gt;John VIII Palaeologus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flagellation]] is also called "scourging". The term "scourge" was applied to the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Outside stand three men representing those who buried the body of Christ. The two older, [[Nicodemus]] and [[Joseph of Arimathaea]], are believed to be portraits of men who recently lost their sons, one of them to plague. The third man is the young disciple [[St. John the Evangelist|John]], and is perhaps a portrait of one of the sons, or else represents both of them in a single idealised figure, coinciding with the manner in which Piero painted angels.

==Elements of Renaissance painting==
Renaissance painting differed from the painting of the Late Medieval period in its emphasis upon the close observation of nature, particularly with regards to human anatomy, and the application of scientific principles to the use of perspective and light.
&lt;!---NOTE RE FORMAT: These galleries are carefully arranged in a 4 per row format. This has been done in order to facilitate comaparisons between adjacent paintings, both horizontally and vertically. In other words, they are laid out with the same care as the curator empoys in a realworld gallery exhibition. Please do not return them to the "single row" format, as it is counterproductive to this particular article.---&gt;

===Linear perspective===
The pictures in the gallery below show the development of linear perspective in buildings and cityscapes. 
* In [[Giotto]]'s fresco, the building is like a stage set with one side open to the viewer.
* In [[Paolo Uccello]]'s fresco, the townscape gives an impression of depth.
* [[Masaccio]]'s ''[[holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' was painted with carefully calculated mathematical proportions, in which he was probably assisted by the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]].
* [[Fra Angelico]] uses the simple motif of a small [[loggia]] accurately drafted to create an intimate space.
* [[Gentile Bellini]] has painted a vast space, the [[Piazza San Marco]] in [[Venice]], in which the receding figures add to the sense of perspective.
* [[Leonardo da Vinci]] did detailed and measured drawings of the background Classical ruins preparatory to commencing the unfinished ''Adoration of the Magi''.
* [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] created an exceptionally complex and expansive setting on three levels, including a steeply descending ramp and a jutting wall. Elements of the landscape, such as the church on the right, are viewed partly through other structures.
* [[Raphael]]'s design for ''Fire in the Borgo'' shows buildings around a small square in which the background events are highlighted by the perspective.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Landscape===
The depiction of landscape was encouraged by the development of linear perspective and the inclusion of detailed landscapes in the background of many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s of the 15th century. Also through this influence came an awareness of [[atmospheric perspective]] and the observation of the way distant things are affected by light. 
* Giotto uses a few rocks to give the impression of a mountain setting.
* Paolo Uccello has created a detailed and surreal setting as a stage for many small scenes.
* In [[Vittore Carpaccio|Carpaccio]]'s ''Deposition of the Body of Christ'', the desolate rocky landscape echoes the tragedy of the scene.
* [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s landscape has a sculptural, three-dimensional quality that is suggestive of a real physical space. The details of the rocks, their strata and fractures, suggest that he studied the [[geology|geological]] formations of the red [[limestone]] prevalent in areas of Northern Italy.
* [[Antonello da Messina]] sets the grim scene of the ''[[Crucifixion (Antonello da Messina)|Crucifixion]]'' in contrast to the placid countryside which rolls into the far distance, becoming paler and bluer as it recedes.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]] has created a detailed landscape with a pastoral scene between the foreground and background mountains. There are numerous levels in this landscape, making it the equivalent of Ghirlandaio's complex cityscape (above).
* [[Perugino]] has set the ''Adoration of the Magi'' against the familiar hilly landscape of [[Umbria]].
* Leonardo da Vinci, displays a theatrical use of [[atmospheric perspective]] in his view of the precipitous mountains around [[Lago di Garda]] at the foothills of the [[Alps]] in Northern Italy.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Light===
Light and shade exist in a painting in two forms. Tone is simply the lightness and darkness of areas of a picture, graded from white to black. Tonal arrangement is a very significant feature of some paintings. [[Chiaroscuro]] is the modelling of apparent surfaces within a picture by the suggestion of light and shadow. While tone was an important feature of paintings of the Medieval period, chiaroscuro was not. It became increasingly important to painters of the 15th century, transforming the depiction of three-dimensional space.
* [[Taddeo Gaddi]]'s ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' is the first known large painting of a night scene. The internal light source of the picture is the angel.
* In [[Fra Angelico]]'s painting, daylight, which appears to come from the actual window of the friary cell which this fresco adorns, gently illuminates the figures and defines the architecture.
* In his [[Histories of the True Cross|''Emperor's Dream'']], [[Piero della Francesca]] takes up the theme of the night scene illuminated by an angel and applies his scientific knowledge of the diffusion of light. The tonal pattern thus created is a significant element in the composition of the painting.
* In his ''[[Agony in the Garden (Bellini)|Agony in the Garden]]'', [[Giovanni Bellini]] uses the fading sunset on a cloudy evening to create an atmosphere of tension and impending tragedy.
* In [[Domenico Veneziano]]'s formal portrait, the use of chiaroscuro to model the form is slight. However, the painting relies strongly on the tonal contrasts of the pale face, mid-tone background and dark garment with patterned bodice for effect.
* [[Botticelli]] uses chiaroscuro to model the face of the sitter and define the details of his simple garment. The light and shadow on the edge of the window define the angle of the light.
* The suggested authorship of this early-16th-century portrait {{Clarify |reason=Unclear which painting; refer to by name|date=October 2018}} includes [[Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio]], [[Mariotto Albertinelli]] and [[Giuliano Bugiardini]]. The painting combines many of the lighting effects of the other works in this gallery. The form is modelled by the light and shade, as if by a setting sun, which gives an element of drama, enhanced by the landscape. The tonal pattern created by the dark garment, the white linen and position of the hand is a compositional feature of the painting.
* In [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|John the Baptist]]'', elements of the painting, including the corners of the model's eyes and mouth, are disguised by shadow, creating an air of ambiguity and mystery.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Anatomy===
While remaining largely dependent upon topographic observation, the knowledge of anatomy was advanced by Leonardo da Vinci's meticulous dissection of 30 corpses. Leonardo, among others, impressed upon students the necessity of the close observation of life and made the drawing of live models an essential part of a student's formal study of the art of painting. 
* [[Cimabue]]'s ''[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Crucifixion]]'', extensively destroyed by flood in 1966, shows the formal arrangement, with curving body and drooping head that was prevalent in late Medieval art. The anatomy is strongly stylised to conform with traditional iconic formula.
* [[Giotto]] abandoned the traditional formula and painted from observation.
* [[Massacio]]'s figure of Christ is foreshortened as if viewed from below, and shows the upper torso strained as if with the effort of breathing.
* In [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''Deposition'' the artist, while not attempting to suggest the brutal realities of the crucifixion, has attempted to give the impression of death.
* In [[Piero della Francesca]]'s ''Baptism'', the robust figure of Jesus is painted with a simplicity and lack of sharply defined muscularity that belies its naturalism.
* The figure of Jesus in this painting, which is the combined work of [[Verrocchio]] and the young Leonardo, has in all probability been drafted by Verrocchio. The contours retain the somewhat contorted linearity of Gothic art. Much of the torso, however, is thought to have been painted by Leonardo and reveals a strong knowledge of anatomical form.
* Leonardo's picture of St. Jerome shows the results of detailed study of the shoulder girdle, known from a page of drawings.
* [[Michelangelo]] used human anatomy to great expressive effect. He was renowned for his ability in the creation of expressive poses and was imitated by many other painters and sculptors.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Realism===
The observation of nature meant that set forms and symbolic gestures which in Medieval art, and particularly the Byzantine style prevalent in much of Italy, were used to convey meaning, were replaced by the representation of human emotion as displayed by a range of individuals. 
*In this ''Resurrection'', [[Giotto]] shows the sleeping soldiers with faces hidden by helmets or foreshortened to emphasise the relaxed posture.
*In contrast, [[Andrea Castagno]] has painted a life-sized image of the condotierre, Pippo Spano, alert and with his feet over the edge of the painted niche which frames him.
*[[Filippo Lippi]] in this early work shows a very naturalistic group of children crowding around the Virgin Mary, but looking with innocent curiosity at the viewer. One of the children has [[Down syndrome]].
* [[Masaccio]] depicts the grief resulting from loss of innocence as [[Adam and Eve]] are expelled from the presence of God.
* [[Antonello da Messina]] painted several versions of ''[[Ecce Homo (Antonello da Messina)|Ecce Homo]]'', the tormented Christ as he was presented to the people by the Roman Governor. Such paintings usually show Christ in a tragic but heroic role, minimising the depiction of suffering. Antonello's depictions are starkly realistic.
* In his ''[[Dead Christ (Mantegna)|Lamentation over the Dead christ]]'', [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] has here depicted the dead body of Jesus with daring foreshortening, as if the viewer were standing at the end of the slab.
* In this detail from a larger painting, Mantegna shows a little child, wearing a tummy-binder and holey slippers, turning away and chewing its fingers while the infant Christ is circumcised.
* [[Giorgione]] paints a natural and unglamorised portrait of an old woman, unusual in its depiction of her illkempt hair and open mouth with crooked teeth.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Figure composition===
Among the preoccupations of artists commissioned to do large works with multiple figures were how to make the subject, usually narrative, easily read by the viewer, natural in appearance and well composed within the picture space. 
* [[Giotto]] combines three separate narrative elements into this dramatic scene set against the dehumanising helmets of the guards. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] betrays [[Jesus]] to the soldiers by kissing him. The High Priest signals to a guard to seize him. Peter slices the ear off the high priest's servant as he steps forward to lay hands on Jesus. Five figures dominate the foreground, surrounding Jesus so that only his head is visible. Yet by skillful arrangement of color and the gestures of the men, Giotto makes the face of Jesus the focal point of the painting.
* In ''The Death of Adam'', [[Piero della Francesca]] has set the dying patriarch so that he is cast into relief against the black garment worn by one of his family. His importance to the story is further emphasised by the arch of figures formed around him and the diagonals of the arms which all lead to his head. p
* ''The Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus'' is a remarkably cohesive whole, considering that it was begun by [[Masaccio]], left unfinished, vandalised, and eventually completed by [[Filippino Lippi]]. Masaccio painted the central section.
* [[Pollaiuolo]], in this highly systemised painting, has taken the [[cross-bow]] used by the archers in the foreground, as the compositional structure. Within this large triangular shape, divided vertically, he has alternated the figures between front and back views.
* [[Botticelli]]'s long, narrow painting of ''[[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|Mars and Venus]]'' is based on a W with the figures mirroring each other. The lovers, who shortly before were united, are now separated by sleep. The three small fawns who process across the painting hold the composition together.
* [[Michelangelo]]s mastery of complex figure composition, as in his ''[[Deposition (Michelangelo)|The Entombment]]'' was to inspire many artists for centuries. In this panel painting the figure of Christ, though vertical, is slumped and a dead weight at the centre of the picture, while those who try to carry the body lean outwards to support it.
* At first glance, [[Signorelli]]'s ''Fall of the Damned'' is an appalling and violent jumble of bodies, but by the skilful placement of the figures so that the lines, rather than intersecting, flow in an undulating course through the picture, the composition is both unified and resolved into a large number of separate actions. The colours of the devils also serve to divide the picture into the tormentors and the tormented.
* ''The Battle of Ostia'' was executed by [[Raphael]]'s assistants, probably to his design. The foreground of the painting is organised into two overlapping arched shapes, the larger showing captives being subdued, while to the left and slightly behind, they are forced to kneel before the Pope. While the Pope rises above the second group and dominates it, the first group is dominated by a soldier whose colour and splendid headdress acts like a visual stepping stone to the Pope. At the edges of this group two stooping figures mirror each other, creating a tension in which one pushes away from the edge of the painting and the other pulls upward at its centre.

==Major works==

===Altarpieces===
Through the Renaissance period, the large [[altarpiece]] had a unique status as a commission.  An altarpiece was destined to become a focal point, not only visually in the religious building it occupied, but also in the devotions of the worshippers. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''Madonna of the Rocks'', now in the [[National Gallery, London]] but previously in a chapel in [[Milan]], is one of many images that was used in the petitioning of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] against plague. The significance of these images to those who commissioned them, who worshipped in their location, and who created them is lost when they are viewed in an art gallery.

* The two ''Enthroned Madonnas'' by [[Cimabue]] and [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]] demonstrate the variations on a theme that was formalised and constrained by tradition. Although the positions of the Madonna and Child are very similar, the artists have treated most of the features differently. Cimabue's throne is front-on and uses perspective to suggest its solidity. The angels, their faces, wings and haloes, are arranged to form a rich pattern. The gold leaf detailing of the Madonna's garment picks out the folds in a delicate network. The Child sits regally, with his feet set at the same angle as his mother's.
* In Duccio's ''[[Rucellai Madonna]]'', the largest of its kind at 4.5 metres high, the throne is set diagonally and the Child, much more of a baby despite his gesture, sits diagonally opposed to his mother. While the positioning of the kneeling angels is quite simplistic, they have a naturalism in their repeated postures and are varied by the beautiful colour combinations of their robes. On the Madonna's robe the gold border makes a meandering line, defining the form and contours, and enlivening the whole composition with a single decorative detail.
* [[Giotto]]'s ''[[Ognissanti Madonna]]'' is now housed in the same room of the [[Uffizi]] as Cimabue's and Duccio's, where the advances that he made in both drawing from the observation of nature, and in his use of perspective can be easily compared with the earlier masters. While the painting conforms to the model of an altarpiece, the figures within it do not follow the traditional formula. The Madonna and Child are solidly three-dimensional. This quality is enhanced by the canopied throne which contributes the main decorative element, while gold borders are minimised. The angels, which mirror each other, each have quite individual drapery.
* A hundred years later, [[Masaccio]], still within the constraints of the formal altarpiece, confidently creates a three-dimensional figure draped in heavy robes, her chubby Christ Child sucking on his fingers. The lutes played by the little angels are both steeply foreshortened.
* In [[Fra Angelico]]'s painting the figures lack the emphasis on mass of Masaccio's. Angelico was renowned for his delicacy in depicting the Madonna. The appeal of such paintings is demonstrated in the way the adoring angels are clustered around. As in Masaccio's painting, the Madonna's halo is decorated with [[pseudo-kufic]] script, probably to suggest her [[Middle Eastern]] origin.
* In the hands of [[Piero della Francesca]] the formal gold frame is transformed into a classical niche, drawn in perfect linear perspective and defined by daylight. The assorted saints cluster round in a natural way, while the Madonna sits on a realistic throne on a small podium covered by an [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|oriental carpet]], while the donor [[Federico da Montefeltro]] kneels at her feet. A concession to tradition is that the Madonna is of a larger scale than the other figures.
* In [[Giovanni Bellini|Bellini]]'s painting, while on one hand, the figures and the setting give the effect of great realism, Bellini's interest in Byzantine icons is displayed in the hierarchical enthronement and demeanour of the Madonna.
* The [[Milan]]ese painter [[Bergognone]] has drawn on aspects of the work of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and Bellini to create this painting in which the red robe and golden hair of Catherine of Alexandria are effectively balanced by the contrasting black and white of Catherine of Siena, and framed by a rustic arch of broken bricks.
* In [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Madonna della Vittoria]]'', the Madonna may occupy the central position, framed in her garlanded gazebo, but the focus of attention is [[Francesco II Gonzaga]] whose achievements are acknowledged not only by the Madonna and Christ Child but by the heroic saints, Michael and George.
* [[Leonardo da Vinci]] abandoned any sort of formal canopy and surrounded the Madonna and Child with the grandeur of nature into which he set the figures in a carefully balanced yet seemingly informal trapezoid composition.
* The ''[[Sistine Madonna]]'' by [[Raphael]] uses the formula not of an altarpiece but the formal portrait, with a frame of green curtains through which a vision can be seen, witnessed by [[Pope Sixtus II]] for whom the work is named. The clouds around the Virgin are composed of cherubic faces, while the two iconic cherubs so beloved with the late 20th century fashion for angels, prop themselves on the sill. This work became the model for [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] and many other painters.
* [[Andrea del Sarto]], while using figures to a very natural and lifelike effect, abandons in the ''Madonna of the Harpies'' practical reality by setting the Madonna on a Classical plinth as if she were a statue. Every figure is in a state of instability, marked by the forward thrust of the Madonna's knee against which she balances a book. This painting is showing the trends that were to be developed in [[Mannerism|Mannerist painting]].

===Fresco cycles===
The largest, most time-consuming paid work that an artist could do was a scheme of [[fresco]]es for a church, private palace or commune building. Of these, the largest unified scheme in Italy which remains more-or-less intact is that created by a number of different artists at the end of the Medieval period at the [[Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi]]. It was followed by [[Giotto]]'s Proto-Renaissance scheme at Padua and many others ranging from [[Benozzo Gozzoli]]'s [[Magi Chapel]] for the [[Medici]] to [[Michelangelo]]'s supreme accomplishment for [[Pope Julius II]] at the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|Sistine Chapel]]. 
* [[Giotto]] painted the large, free-standing [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] with the '' [[Life of the Virgin]]'' and the ''[[Life of Christ]]''. Breaking from medieval tradition, it set a standard of naturalism.
* The two large frescoes of ''Allegories of Good and Bad Government'' painted by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] for the Commune of Siena are completely secular and show detailed views of a townscape with citizens, emphasising the importance of civic order.
* By contrast, [[Andrea di Bonaiuto]], painting for the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s at the new church of [[Santa Maria Novella]], completed a huge fresco of ''the Triumph of the Church'', which shows the role of the church in the work of [[Salvation]], and in particular, the role of the Dominicans, who also appear symbolically as ''the Hounds of Heaven'', shepherding the people of God. The painting includes a view of [[Florence Cathedral]].
* [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino]] collaborated on the [[Brancacci Chapel]] fresco cycle which is most famous for Masaccio's lifelike innovations, Masolino's more elegant style is seen in this townscape which skillfully combines two episodes of ''the Life of St. Peter''.
* [[Piero della Francesca]]'s fresco cycle in the church of [[San Francesco, Arezzo]], closely follows the Legend of the True Cross as written by [[Jacopo da Varagine]] in the '' [[Golden Legend]]''. The pictures reveal his studies of light and perspective, and the figures have an almost monolithic solidity.
* [[Benozzo Gozzoli]]'s [[Magi Chapel|fresco cycle for the private chapel]] of the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi|Medici Palace]] is a late work in the [[International Gothic]] style, a fanciful and richly ornamental depiction of the Medici with their entourage as the [[Three Wise Men]].
* The elaborate cycle for the [[House of Este]]'s [[Palazzo Schifanoia]] at Ferrara, executed in part by [[Francesco del Cossa]], was also fanciful in its depictions of Classical deities and Zodial signs which are combined with scenes of the life of the family.
* [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s paintings for the Gonzaga also show family life but have a preponderance of highly realistic elements and skillfully utilise the real architecture of the room they decorate, the mantelpiece forming a plinth for the figures and the real ceiling pendentives being apparently supported on painted pilasters.
* While in the Brancacci Chapel, historians seek to identify the faces of Masaccio, Masolino and perhaps Donatello among the apostles, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] at the [[Sassetti Chapel]] makes no attempt to disguise his models. Each fresco in this religious cycle has two sets of figures: those who tell the story and those who are witness to it. In this scene of ''the Birth of the Virgin Mary'', a number of the noble women of Florence have come in, as if to congratulate the new mother.
* ''[[The Punishment of the Sons of Korah]]'' by [[Botticelli]] is one of episodes the ''Life of Moses'' series, which, together with ''The Life of Christ'', was commissioned in the 1480s as decoration to the [[Sistine Chapel]]. The artists [[Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]] all worked on the carefully designed and harmonious scheme.
* [[Michelangelo]]'s painting of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, which he executed alone over a period of five years, with narratives from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], prophetic figures and the Ancestors of Christ, was destined to become one of the most famous artworks in the world.
* Simultaneously, [[Raphael]] and a number of his assistants painted the papal chambers known as ''[[Raphael Rooms]]''. In ''[[The School of Athens]]'' Raphael depicts famous people of his day, including Leonardo, Michelangelo, Bramante and himself, as philosophers of ancient Athens.

==Subjects==
Devotional images of the ''[[Madonna and Child]]'' were produced in very large numbers, often for private clients. Scenes of ''the Life of Christ'', the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'',  or ''Lives of the Saints'' were also made in large numbers for churches, particularly scenes associated with the ''[[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]]'' and ''the Passion of Christ''. ''The Last Supper'' was commonly depicted in religious refectories.

During the Renaissance an increasing number of patrons had their likeness committed to posterity in paint. For this reason there exists a great number of Renaissance portraits for whom the name of the sitter is unknown. Wealthy private patrons commissioned artworks as decoration for their homes, of increasingly secular subject matter.

===Devotional paintings===

====The Madonna====
These small intimate pictures, which are now nearly all in museums, were most often done for private ownership, but might occasionally grace a small altar in a chapel.

* ''The Madonna adoring the Christ Child with two Angels'' has always been particularly popular on account of the expressive little boy angel supporting the Christ Child. Paintings of [[Filippo Lippi]]'s such as this were to particularly influence [[Botticelli]].
* [[Verrocchio]] separates the Madonna and Christ Child from the viewer by a stone sill, also used in many portraits. The rose and the cherries represent spiritual love and sacrificial love.
* [[Antonello da Messina]]'s ''Madonna and Child'' is superficially very like that of Verrocchio, but it is much less formal and both the mother and the child appear to be moving rather than posing for the painter. The foreshortened elbow of the Child as he reaches for his mother's breast occurs in Raphael's work and can be seen in a different form in Michelangelo's ''Doni Tondo''.
* The figures placed at opposing diagonals seen in this early ''Madonna and Child'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was a compositional theme that was to recur in many of his works and be imitated by his pupils and by Raphael.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]] was influenced by [[Greek Orthodox]] [[icon]]s. The gold cloth in this painting takes the place of the gold leaf background. The arrangement is formal, yet the gestures, and in particular the mother's adoring gaze, give a human warmth to this picture.
* [[Vittore Carpaccio]]'s ''Madonna and Child'' is very unusual in showing the Christ Child as a toddler fully dressed in contemporary clothing. The meticulous detail and domesticity are suggestive of [[Early Netherlandish painting]].
* [[Michelangelo]]'s Doni Tondo is the largest of these works, but was a private commission. The highly unusual composition, the contorted form of the Madonna, the three heads all near the top of the painting and the radical foreshortening were all very challenging features, and Agnolo Doni was not sure that he wished to pay for it.
* [[Raphael]] has skillfully set opposing forces into play, and united the Madonna and Child with a loving gaze.

===Secular paintings===

====Portraits====
During the latter half of the 15th century, there was a proliferation of portraits. Although the subjects of some of them were later remembered for their achievements or their noble lineage, the identities of many have been lost and that of even the most famous portrait of all time, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', is open to speculation and controversy.

* The advantage of a profile portrait such as [[Piero della Francesca]]'s ''[[Portrait of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]]'' is that it identifies the subject like a facial signature. The proportions of the face, the respective angles of the forehead, nose and brow, the position and shape of the eye and the set of the jaw remain recognisable through life. Moreover, once a profile likeness has been taken, it can be used to cast a medal or sculpt an image in relief.
* [[Pollaiuolo]] has conformed to the formula, emphasising this young woman's profile with a fine line which also defines the delicate shape of her nostrils and the corners of her mouth. But he has added a three-dimensional quality by the subtle use of [[chiaroscuro]] and the treatment of the rich Florentine brocade of her sleeve.
* [[Alesso Baldovinetti]], on the other hand, has used the profile of this strong-featured girl to create a striking pattern of a highlighted contour against the darker background. The background is a lively shape adding to the compositional structure of the painting. The little black fillet on her forehead responds to the dynamic pattern of the embroidered sleeve.
* [[Botticelli]]'s portrait, although turned to three-quarter view with strong tonal modelling, has much to do with Baldovinetti's painting in its striking arrangement of shapes in the red garment, the hat and the dark hair and the pattern that they form against the background.
* [[Antonello da Messina]]'s portrait, some years earlier than Botticelli's, bears it a passing similarity. But this painting does not rely heavily on the skilful arrangement of clearly contoured shapes. Antonello has used the advantages of oil paint, as against Botticelli's [[tempera]], to achieve a subtle and detailed likeness in which the bushy eyebrows, the imperfections of the skin and the shadow of the beard have been rendered with photographic precision.
* [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]]'s tempera portrait of [[An Old Man and his Grandson|an old man with his grandson]] combines the meticulous depiction of the old man's enlarged nose and parchment-like skin with a tenderness usually reserved for portrayals of ''The Madonna and Child''. Ghirlandaio takes this analogy further by setting the scene against a window and landscape.
* [[Pintoricchio]]'s portrait of a boy sets him high in the picture frame, reducing his scale in proportion to the area in contrast to the usual way of showing adults. The painting is set against a landscape such as used by Leonardo and Bellini. Pinturicchio's main fame lay in his skillfully characterised portraits like this.
* In the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' Leonardo employed the technique of ''sfumato'', delicately graded chiaroscuro that models the surface contours, while allowing details to disappear in the shadows. The technique gives an air of mystery to this painting which has brought it lasting fame. The beautiful hands become almost a decorative element.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s portrait of the elected Duke of Venice has an official air and could hardly be more formal. Yet the face is characterised with what one might hope for in the Doge, wisdom, humour and decisiveness. Although a more elaborate painting, it has much in common with Baldovinetti's sense of design.
* The subject of [[Titian]]'s portrait is unknown, and its considerable fame rests solely on its beauty and unusual composition in which the face is supported and balanced by the large blue sleeve of quilted satin. The sleeve is almost the same colour as the background; its rich tonality gives it form. The white linen of the shirt enlivens the composition, while the man's eyes pick up the colour of the sleeve with penetrating luminosity.
* Superficially, [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s portrait has many of the same elements as Titian's. But it is handled very differently, being much broader in treatment, and less compelling in subject. The painting has achieved an imediacy, as if the sitter has paused for a moment and is about to return to what he is doing.
* [[Raphael]], in this much-copied portrait of [[Pope Julius II]], set a standard for the painting of future popes. Unlike the contemporary portraits here by Bellini, Titian and del Sarto, Raphael has abandoned the placement of the figure behind a shelf or barrier and has shown the Pope as if seated in his own apartment. Against the green cloth decorated with the keys of [[St. Peter]], the red velvet papal garments make a rich contrast, the white beard being offset by the pleated white linen. On the uprights of the chair, the acorn finials are the symbol of the Pope's family, the ''[[della Rovere]]''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====The nude====
These four famous paintings demonstrate the advent and acceptance of the nude as a subject for the artist in its own right. 
* In [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]]'', the nude figure, although central to the painting, is not of itself the subject. The subject of the painting is a story from [[Classical mythology]]. The fact that the Goddess Venus rose naked from the sea provides justification for the nude study that dominates the centre of the work.
* Painted thirty years later, the exact meaning of [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s picture is unclear. Had the subject been painted by an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter, it would be quite unnecessary to ascribe a meaning. But in this Renaissance work, there is the presence of a mirror, an object that is usually symbolic and which suggests an allegory. The young lady's nakedness is a sign not so much of seduction, as innocence and vulnerability. However, she decks herself out in an extremely rich headdress, stitched with pearls, and having not one, but two mirrors, sees only herself reflected endlessly. The mirror, often a symbol of prophecy, here becomes an object of vanity, with the young woman in the role of [[narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]].
* [[Giorgione]]'s painting possibly predates Bellini's by ten years. It has always been known as ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|The Sleeping Venus]]'' but there is nothing in the painting to confirm that it is, indeed, Venus. The painting is remarkable for its lack of symbolism and the emphasis on the body simply as an object of beauty. It is believed to have been completed by Titian.
* [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'', on the other hand, was painted for the pleasure of the Duke of Urbino, and as in Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'', painted for a member of the Medici family, the model looks directly at the viewer. The model may very well have been the mistress of the client. Venus of Urbino is not simply a body beautiful in its own right. She is an individual and highly seductive young woman, who is not in the nude state indicative of heavenly perfection, but is simply naked, having taken off her clothes but left on some of her jewellery.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Classical mythology====
Paintings of classical mythology were invariably done for the important salons in the houses of private patrons. Botticelli's most famous works are for the Medici, Raphael painted ''Galatea'' for Agostino Chigi and Bellini's ''[[Feast of the Gods (Bellini)|Feast of the Gods]]'' was, with several works by Titian, in the home of [[Alfonso I d'Este]]

* [[Pollaiuolo]]'s ''Hercules and the Hydra'' typifies many paintings of mythological subjects which lent themselves to interpretation that was both Humanist and Christian. In this work good overcomes evil, and courage is glorified. The figure of Hercules has resonances with the Biblical character of [[Samson]] who also was renowned for his strength and slew a lion.
* In [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', Wisdom,&lt;!---don't delete this capital---&gt; personified by Athena, leads the cowering Centaur by the forelock, so learning and refinement are able to overcome brute instinct, which is the characteristic symbolised by the centaur.
* [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Galatea (Raphael)|Galatea]]'', though Classical in origin, has a specifically Christian resonance that would have been recognised by those who were familiar with the story. It is about the nature of love. While all around her aspire to earthly love and succumb to the arrows shot by the trio of cupids, Galatea has chosen spiritual love and turns her eyes to Heaven.
* Three large works remain that were painted for a single room for the Este by [[Filippo Bellini|Bellini]] and his successor [[Titian]]. Of these, Titian's ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' represents a moment in a narrative. The other two paintings are jolly drinking scenes with a number of narrative elements introduced in a minor way, in order that characters might be identifiable. This painting does not appear to have any higher allegorical sentiment attached to it. It appears to be simply a very naturalistic portrayal of a number of the ancient gods and their associates, eating, drinking and enjoying the party.

The '''''USS Maine National Monument''''' is an outdoor monument, located in [[Central Park]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. It was cast on September 1, 1912 and dedicated on May 30, 1913 to the men killed aboard {{USS|Maine|ACR-1}} when the ship exploded in [[Havana harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/centralpark/monuments/966|title=Central Park: U.S.S.

In 1913, a USS ''Maine'' Monument designed by [[Harold Van Buren Magonigle]] was completed and dedicated in New York City. Located at the southwest corner of [[Central Park]] at the Merchants' Gate entrance to the park, the monument consists of a pylon with a fountain at its base and sculptures by [[Attilio Piccirilli]] surrounding it.&lt;ref name="New York Times 25 May 1913"&gt;

[[File:Adam Savage HOPE.jpg|thumb|Video feedback of [[Adam Savage]]]]

'''Video feedback''' is the process that starts and continues when a [[video camera]] is pointed at its own playback [[video monitor]]. The loop delay from camera to display back to camera is at least one [[video]] frame time, due to the input and output scanning processes; it can be more if there is more processing in the loop.

==History==
First discovered shortly after [[Charlie Ginsburg]] invented the first video recorder for [[Ampex]] in 1956, video feedback was considered a nuisance and unwanted noise.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Technicians and studio camera people were chastised for allowing a video camera to see its own monitor as the overload of self-amplified video signal wreaked havoc with the 1950s video pickup, often ruining the pickup.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It could also cause [[screen burn-in]] on a playback TV and/or monitors of the time as well, by generating static brightly illuminated display patterns.

In the 1960s early examples of video feedback art become introduced into the [[psychedelic art]] scene in [[New York City]]. [[Nam June Paik]] is often cited as the first [[video art]]ist, although this is disputed; he had clips of video feedback on display in New York City at the [[Greenwich Cafe]] in the mid 1960s. 

Early video feedback works were created by media artist/experimenters on the East and West Coasts in the late 1960s and early 70's. Video feedback artists [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], with [[Richard Lowenberg]] and others, formed The Kitchen, which was located in the kitchen of a broken-down hotel in lower Manhattan; while [[Skip Sweeney]] and others founded Video Free America in San Francisco, to nurture their video art and feedback experiments.

[[David Sohn]] mentions video feedback in his 1970 book ''Film, the Creative Eye''. This book was part of the base curriculum for [[Richard Lederer]] of [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]], when he introduced making videofeedback as part of an English curriculum in his 1970s course Creative Eye in Film. Several students in this class participated regularly in the making and recording of videofeedback. [[Sony]] had released the VuMax series of recording video cameras and manually "hand-looped" video tape decks by this time which did two things: it increased the resolution of the video image, which made the picture more attractive, and it brought video tape recording technology within the general public's grasp for the first time and allowed for such video experimentation to take place by the general public.

During the 1980s and into the 1990s video technology became enhanced and evolved into high quality, high definition video recording. [[Michael C. Andersen]] generated the first known mathematical formula of the videofeedback process, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videofeedback.dk/vf/ss/model.gif "Formula for Videofeedback"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132859/http://www.videofeedback.dk/vf/ss/model.gif |date=July 19, 2011 }}. videofeedback.dk. Retrieved 2010-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and he has also generated a [[Mendeleev]]'s square to show the gradual progressive formulaic change of the video image as certain parameters are adjusted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videofeedback.dk/vf/ss/sspost.html "Simulation of video feedback"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007204011/http://www.videofeedback.dk/vf/ss/sspost.html |date=October 7, 2009 }}. videofeedback.dk. Retrieved 2010-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s the rave scene and a social return to art of a more psychedelic nature brought back displays of video feedback on large disco dance floor video screens around the world. There are filters for Adobe Photoshop and non linear video editors that often have video feedback as the filter description, or as a setting on a filter. These filter types either mimic or directly utilize video feedback for its result effect and can be recognized by its vortex, phantasmagoric manipulation of the original recorded image.

==In entertainment==
Many artists have used optical feedback. An example is [[Queen (band)|Queen's]] music video for "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" (1975). The effect (in this simple case) can be compared to looking at oneself between two mirrors.

Other videos that use variations of video feedback include:
* [[Doctor Who]] – ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'' (series, 1963-1973, opening title sequence.)
* [[Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]] — ''[[September (Earth, Wind &amp; Fire song)|September]]'' (1978)
* [[The Jacksons]] – ''[[Blame it on the boogie|Blame It On the Boogie]]'' (1978)
* [[Kate Bush]] – ''[[Hammer_Horror_(song)|Hammer Horror]]'' (1978)
* [[Amii Stewart]] – ''[[Knock on Wood_(song)|Knock on Wood]]'' (1979)
* [[Kool &amp; the Gang]] – ''[[Get Down On It]]'' (1981)
* [[Todd Rundgren]] – ''Something to Fall Back On'' (1985)
* [[Smashing Pumpkins]] – ''[[Ava Adore]]'' (1998)
* [[Klaxons]] – ''[[Gravity's_Rainbow_(song)|Gravity's Rainbow]]'' (2008)
* [[Boxcutter (musician)|Boxcutter]] – ''TV Troubles'' (2011)
* [[Django Django]] – "Life's A Beach" (2012)

The opening titles sequence for the British [[science fiction]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' employed this technique from 1963 to 1973 (initially in black and white, redone in 1967 to showcase the show's new [[625-line]] broadcast resolution and feature the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]]'s face ([[Patrick Troughton]] at that time), then redone again, in colour this time, in 1970. The next title sequence for the show, which debuted in 1973, abandoned this technique in favour of [[slit-scan photography]].

== In science ==
[[File:Screenshot Recursion via vlc.png|thumb|128px|left|[[Droste effect]] recursion in [[VLC media player|VLC]], a computer program.]]
[[File:Optical_feedback.jpg|thumb|128px|left|Optical feedback between mirrors.]]
The optical feedback discussed so far—video feedback, created by a camera pointing at its own monitor—is actually just one particular example of optical feedback. Perhaps the most obvious example of optical feedback in science is the [[optical cavity]] found in almost every [[laser]], which typically consists of two mirrors between which light is amplified. In the late 1990s it was found that so-called unstable-cavity lasers produce light beams whose cross-section present a fractal pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v402/n6758/abs/402138a0.html Laser optics: Fractal modes in unstable resonators], [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] Vol. 402, 138 (11 November 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Optical feedback in science is often closely related to video feedback, so an understanding of video feedback can be useful for other applications of optical feedback. Video feedback has been used to explain the essence of fractal structure of unstable-cavity laser beams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/Optics/play/fractalVideoFeedback/ "Fractal video feedback"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520070401/http://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/Optics/play/fractalVideoFeedback/ |date=May 20, 2011 }}. Optics Group (University of Glasgow). Retrieved 2010-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The page [http://www.cse.salford.ac.uk/profiles/gsmcdonald/FractalLasers.php discovery of fractal lasers] gives an account of laser fractals, the developments of this work, links to further reading, and relates the laser context with video feedback systems. 

Video feedback is also useful as an experimental-mathematics tool.  Examples of its use include the creation of [[Fractal]] patterns using [http://www.sweetandfizzy.com/fractals/diagrams.html multiple monitors] or [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Campus/8446/vid_fractals/index.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:34:34  multiple images created using mirrors].

The page [https://web.archive.org/web/20061017183543/http://www.videofeedback.dk/World/ video feedback in science] provides an overview.

[http://softology.com.au/videofeedback/videofeedback.htm Softology's Video Feedback page] provides links and information about real and simulated video feedback.

Optical feedback is also found in the [[image intensifier]] tube and its variants. Here the feedback is usually an undesirable phenomenon, where the light generated by the phosphor screen "feeds back" to the photocathode, causing the tube to oscillate, and ruining the image. This is typically suppressed by an aluminum reflective screen deposited on the back of the phosphor screen, or by incorporating a [[microchannel plate detector]].

Optical feedback has been used experimentally in these tubes to amplify an image, in the manner of the cavity laser, but this technique has had limited use.

Optical feedback has also been experimented with as an electron source, since a photocathode-phosphor cell will 'latch' when triggered, providing a steady stream of electrons. See US Patent 4,531,122 for a typical application.

== In philosophy ==
[[Douglas Hofstadter]] discusses video feedback in his book ''[[I Am a Strange Loop]]'' about the human mind and consciousness. He devotes a chapter to describing his experiments with video feedback.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At some point during the session, I accidentally stuck my hand momentarily in front of the camera's lens. Of course the screen went all dark, but when I removed my hand, the previous pattern did not just pop right back onto the screen, as expected. Instead I saw a different pattern on the screen, but this pattern, unlike anything I'd seen before, was not stationary.&lt;ref name=hofstadter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hofstadter|first=Douglas|title=I Am a Strange loop|year=2007|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-03079-8|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|text=[[Graphical sound]], a recording technique}}

'''Visual music''', sometimes called '''colour music''', refers to the use of musical structures in visual imagery, which can also include [[silent film]]s or silent [[Lumia (art)|Lumia]] work. It also refers to methods or devices which can translate sounds or music into a related visual presentation. An expanded definition may include the translation of music to painting; this was the original definition of the term, as coined by [[Roger Fry]] in 1912 to describe the work of [[Wassily Kandinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3653012/The-man-who-heard-his-paintbox-hiss.html|title=The man who heard his paintbox hiss|first=Ossian|last=Ward|date=9 June 2006|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of definitions of visual music, particularly as the field continues to expand. In some recent writing, usually in the [[fine art]] world, visual music is often confused with or defined as [[synaesthesia]], though historically this has never been a definition of visual music. Visual music has also been defined as a form of [[intermedia]].

Visual music also refers to systems which convert music or sound directly into visual forms, such as [[film]], [[video]], [[computer graphics]], installations or performances by means of a mechanical instrument, an artist's interpretation, or a computer. The reverse is applicable also, literally converting images to sound by drawn objects and figures on a film's soundtrack, in a technique known as drawn or [[graphical sound]]. Famous visual music artists include [[Jordan Belson]], [[Oskar Fischinger]], [[Norman McLaren]], [[John Whitney Sr.]], and [[Thomas Wilfred]], plus a number contemporary artists. 

==Instruments==

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Since ancient times artists have longed to create with moving lights a music for the eye comparable to the effects of sound for the ear.''&lt;br&gt;&amp;ndash; Dr. [[William Moritz]], the best-known historian of ''visual music'' writing in English, his speciality being the work of [[Oskar Fischinger]].&lt;ref name="CVMWM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/TAVM.htm|title=Towards an Aesthetics of Visual Music|last=Moritz|first=William|year=1986|publisher=ASIFA Canada Bulletin,|accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sometimes also called "'''color music'''", the history of this tradition includes many experiments with [[color organ]]s. Artist or inventors "built instruments, usually called 'color organs,' that would display modulated colored light in some kind of fluid fashion comparable to music".&lt;ref&gt;Moritz, W, (1997), [http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.1/articles/moritz2.1.html The Dream of Color Music, And Machines That Made it Possible] in  Animation World Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''Farblichtspiele'' ('coloured-light-plays') of former [[Bauhaus]] student [[Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack]]. Several different definitions of color music exist; one is that color music is generally formless projections of colored light. Some scholars and writers have used the term color music interchangeably with visual music.

The construction of instruments to perform visual music live, as with sonic music, has been a continuous concern of this art. Color organs, while related, form an earlier tradition extending as early as the eighteenth century with the Jesuit [[Louis Bertrand Castel]] building an ''ocular harpsichord'' in the 1730s (visited by [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], who composed for it). Other prominent color organ artist-inventors include: [[Alexander Wallace Rimington]], [[Bainbridge Bishop]], [[Thomas Wilfred]], [[Charles Dockum]], [[Mary Hallock-Greenewalt]] and [[Kurt Laurenz Theinert]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==On film==
Visual music and abstract film or video often coincide. Some of the earliest known films of these two genres were hand-painted works produced by the Futurists [[Bruno Corra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{IMdB name|id=0180651|title=Bruno Corra}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arnaldo Ginna]] between 1911 and 1912 (as they report in the [[futurism (art)|Futurist Manifesto of Cinema]]), which are now lost. [[Mary Hallock-Greenewalt]] produced several reels of [[Direct Films|hand-painted films]] (although not traditional [[film|motion pictures]]) that are held by the Historical Society of Philadelphia. Like the Futurist films, and many other visual music films, her 'films' were meant to be a visualization of [[musical form]].

Notable visual music filmmakers include: [[Walter Ruttmann]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Viking Eggeling]], [[Oskar Fischinger]], [[Len Lye]], [[Jordan Belson]], [[Norman McLaren]], [http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/Bute.htm Mary Ellen Bute] (who made a series of films she called Seeing Sound films), [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith]], [[Hy Hirsh]], [[John Whitney (animator)|John]] and [[James Whitney (filmmaker)|James Whitney]], [[Steven Woloshen]] and many others up to present day.

In 2005, a US exhibition called "Visual Music" at the [[Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art]] and The [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in Washington DC included documentation of color organs and featured many visual music films&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/VMFilms.htm|title=VMfilms|author=|date=|website=www.centerforvisualmusic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and videos as well as paintings and some color organs.

The [[Center for Visual Music]] [http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org] in Los Angeles has the world's largest collection of visual music resources. CVM owns the papers, films and much animation artwork of Oskar Fischinger; the original research collection of visual music historian Dr. William Moritz; numerous restored films by Jordan Belson; and an extensive collection of restored films by Mary Ellen Bute, John and James Whitney, Jules Engel, Charles Dockum and others. CVM consulted for and provided films, stills and research for the above-mentioned blockbuster Visual Music exhibition; CVM now provides visual music films, programs, events and talks to museums, archives, festivals and cultural centres worldwide, in addition to curating and developing its own museum exhibitions (recently, Oskar Fischinger: Experiments in Cinematic Abstraction, in Amsterdam). The Fischinger three-projector reconstruction, Raumlichtkunst, was restored and curated by CVM, and has been exhibited at the Whitney Museum NY, Tate Modern London, Len Lye Centre New Zealand, and other museums and galleries worldwide. CVM recently released the second [http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/Fischinger/newdvd.htm Oskar Fischinger DVD], as well as a compilation Visual Music from CVM Archive DVD with films by Jordan Belson, Bute, Dockum, Engel and Barry Spinello.  A summer 2018 CVM Visual Music symposium in California is being organized.

Artist  [[Larry Cuba]], founded the iota Fund in 1994, which was later called iotaCenter. They currently own the films of such artists as [[Sara Petty]], [[Adam Beckett]], some of the films of [[Jules Engel]], [[Sky David]], [[Robert Darroll]] and others. They hosted the renowned Kinetica programs (1999–2003) touring the world introducing new audiences to the wonders of visual music.

==Computer graphics==

[[Image:Oscilloscope diagram.png|thumb|right|Oscilloscope showing a single pitch, a [[sine wave]]]] The [[cathode ray tube]] made possible the [[oscilloscope]], an early electronic device that can produce images that are easily associated with sounds from microphones. The modern [[Laser lighting display]] displays wave patterns produced by similar circuitry. The imagery used to represent audio in [[digital audio workstation]]s is largely based on familiar oscilloscope patterns.
 
The [[Animusic]] company (originally called 'Visual Music') has repeatedly demonstrated the use of computers to convert music &amp;mdash;  principally pop-rock based and composed as [[MIDI]] events &amp;mdash; to animations. Graphic artist-designed [[virtual instrumentation|virtual instruments]] which either play themselves or are played by virtual objects are all, along with the sounds, controlled by MIDI instructions.&lt;ref name="ralberts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2006/03/22/animusic-computer-music-videos.html|title=Inside Animusic's Astonishing Computer Music Videos|last=Alberts|first=Randy|date=March 22, 2006|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc|accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the image-to-sound sphere, [[MetaSynth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uisoftware.com/MetaSynth/index.php|title=MetaSynth 5 for Mac OS|author=|date=|website=www.uisoftware.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes a feature which converts images to sounds. The tool uses drawn or imported bitmap images, which can be manipulated with graphic tools, to generate new sounds or process existing audio. A reverse function allows the creation of images from sounds.&lt;ref name="sasso1005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emusician.com/mag/emusic_ui_softwaremetasynth_mac/|title=U&amp;I SOFTWARE MetaSynth 4 (Mac)|last=Sasso|first=Len|date=Oct 1, 2005|publisher=Electronic Musician|accessdate=15 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301051808/http://emusician.com/mag/emusic_ui_softwaremetasynth_mac/|archive-date=1 March 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some media player software generates animated imagery or [[music visualization]] based on a piece of recorded music:
*autom@ted_VisualMusiC_ 4.0 planned and realized by [[Sergio Maltagliati]]. This program can be configured to create random multiple visual-music variations, starting from a simple sonorous/visual cell. It generates a new and original audio-visual composition each time play is clicked.

==Graphic notation==
Many composers have applied [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]] to write compositions. Pioneering examples are the graphical scores of [[John Cage]] and [[Morton Feldman]]. Also known is the graphical score of [[György Ligeti]]s [[Artikulation (Ligeti)|Artikulation]] designed by Rainer Wehinger.

Musical theorists such as [[Harry Partch]], [[Erv Wilson]], [[Ivor Darreg]], [[Glenn Branca]], and [[Yuri Landman]] applied [[geometry]] in detailed visual musical diagrams explaining [[microtonal]] structures and [[musical scale]]s.

He is noted for the import and release of the [[gypsy moth]] into North America. The spread of the moths as an [[invasive species]] has resulted in the destruction of millions of hardwood trees throughout the eastern United States.{{Citation needed |date=November 2018}}

==Biography==

Trouvelot was born at [[Aisne|Aisne, France]]. During his early years he was apparently involved in politics and had [[Republicanism|republican]] leanings.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Following a [[coup d'état]] by [[Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte]] in [[French coup d'état of 1851|1851]], he fled with his family to the United States. They settled in the town of [[Medford, Massachusetts]], a suburb of [[Boston]], at the address of 27 Myrtle St. There he supported himself and his family as an artist and astronomer.&lt;ref&gt;Jimena Canales, ''A Tenth of A Second: A History'' (Chicago University Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Trouvelot had an interest as an amateur entomologist. In the U.S., [[silk]]-producing moths were being killed off by various diseases. Trouvelot was very interested in [[Lepidoptera]] [[larvae]] including native North American [[silk moths]] which he believed could potentially be used for [[silk production]]. For reasons that remain unknown, Trouvelot brought some [[gypsy moth]] egg masses from Europe in the mid-1860s and was raising gypsy moth larvae in the forest behind his house. Unfortunately, some of the larvae escaped into the nearby woods. There are conflicting reports on the resulting actions. One states that despite issuing oral and written warnings of possible consequences, no officials were willing to assist in searching out and destroying the moths.&lt;ref&gt;The Gypsy Moth: Research Toward Integrated Pest Management, United States Department of Agriculture, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The other notes that he was aware of the risk and there is no direct evidence that he contacted government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A., Fletcher, D.S. &amp; Nye, I.W.B., 1980, in Nye, I.W.B. [Ed.], [http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/butmoth/pdf/GNMW_Vol_2.pdf ''The Generic Names of Moths of the World''], volume 2 © Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History), Publication Number 811 {{ISBN|0-565-00811-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly following this incident, Trouvelot lost interest in [[entomology]] and turned again to astronomy. In this field he could put his skills as an artist to good use by illustrating his observations. His interest in astronomy was apparently aroused in 1870 when he witnessed several [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]s.

When [[Joseph Winlock]], the director of [[Harvard College Observatory]], saw the quality of his illustrations, he invited Trouvelot to join the staff there in 1872. In 1875, he was invited to use the [[United States Naval Observatory|U. S. Naval Observatory]] to use the 26-inch [[refractor]] for a year. During the course of his life he produced about 7,000 quality astronomical illustrations. Fifteen of his most superb [[pastel]] illustrations were published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] in 1881. He was particularly interested in the [[Sun]], and discovered "veiled spots" in 1875. He was elected a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1877.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter T|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterT.pdf|publisher=[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his illustrations, he published about 50 scientific papers.

By 1882, Trouvelot had returned to France and joined the [[Paris Observatory|Meudon Observatory]] where he worked with photography and became engaged in a bitter rivalry with his boss, the astronomer [[Jules Janssen]].&lt;ref&gt;Jimena Canales, ''A Tenth of A Second: A History'' (Chicago University Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; This was a few years before the magnitude of the problem caused by his gypsy moth release became apparent to the local government of Massachusetts. He died in [[Meudon, France]]. The gypsy moth was considered a serious pest and attempts were underway to eradicate it (ultimately these were unsuccessful). To this date, the gypsy moth continues to expand its range in the United States, and together with other foliage-eating pests, cause an estimated $868 million in annual damages.&lt;ref&gt;
