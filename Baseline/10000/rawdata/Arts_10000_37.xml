'''Abstract art''' uses a [[visual language]] of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph Arnheim, ''Visual Thinking'', University of California Press, 1969, {{ISBN|0520018710}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western art]] had been, from the [[Renaissance]] up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the [[19th century]] many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in [[technology]], [[science]] and [[philosophy]]. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gooding, ''Abstract Art'', [[Tate Publishing Ltd|Tate Publishing]], London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and non-representational art are loosely related terms. They are similar, but perhaps not of identical meaning.

Abstraction indicates a departure from reality in depiction of [[image]]ry in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is likely to be exceedingly elusive. Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In [[geometric abstraction]], for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. [[Figurative art]] and total abstraction are almost [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]]. But figurative and [[Representation (arts)|representational]] (or [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]]) art often contains partial abstraction.

Both geometric abstraction and [[lyrical abstraction]] are often totally abstract. Among the very numerous [[art movements]] that embody partial abstraction would be for instance [[fauvism]] in which color is conspicuously and deliberately altered vis-a-vis reality, and [[cubism]], which blatantly alters the forms of the real life entities depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://painting.about.com/od/abstractart/a/abstract_art.htm |title=Abstract Art – What Is Abstract Art or Abstract Painting, retrieved January 7, 2009 |publisher=Painting.about.com |date=2011-06-07 |accessdate=2011-06-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075052/http://painting.about.com/od/abstractart/a/abstract_art.htm| archivedate= 7 July 2011 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |title=Themes in American Art – Abstraction, retrieved January 7, 2009 |publisher=Nga.gov |date=2000-07-27 |accessdate=2011-06-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608093226/http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |archivedate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstraction in early art and many cultures ==
{{Main article|Prehistoric art|Eastern art history}}

Much of the art of earlier cultures – signs and marks on pottery, textiles, and inscriptions and paintings on rock – used simple, geometric and linear forms which might have had a symbolic or decorative purpose.&lt;ref&gt;György Kepes, ''Sign, Image and Symbol'', [[Studio Vista]], London, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; It is at this level of visual meaning that abstract art communicates.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Hyatt,"Meeting on the Moor", ''[[Modern Painters]]'', Autumn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; One can enjoy the beauty of [[Chinese calligraphy]] or [[Islamic calligraphy]] without being able to read it.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Leys, 2013.

[[File:Immortal in Splashed Ink.jpg|thumb|left|''Immortal in splashed ink'', Liang Kai, China, 12th century]]
In Chinese painting, abstraction can be traced to the [[Tang dynasty]] painter Wang Mo (王墨), who is credited to have invented the splashed-ink painting style.&lt;ref&gt;Lippit, Y. (2012). "Of Modes and Manners in Japanese Ink Painting: Sesshū's Splashed Ink Landscape of 1495". ''The Art Bulletin'', 94(1), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; While none of his paintings remain, this style is clearly seen in some [[Song Dynasty]] Paintings. The [[Chan Buddhism|Chan buddhist]] painter Liang Kai (梁楷, c. 1140–1210) applied the style to figure painting in his "Immortal in splashed ink"  in which accurate representation is sacrificed to enhance spontaneity linked to the non-rational mind of the enlightened. A late Song painter named Yu Jian, adept to [[Tiantai|Tiantai buddhism]], created a series of splashed ink landscapes that eventually inspired many Japanese zen painters. His paintings show heavily misty mountains in which the shapes of the objects are barely visible and extremely simplified. This type of painting was continued by [[Sesshu Toyo]] in his later years.
[[File:Yujian ink Mercadodemontaña.jpg|thumb|right|''Mountain market, clearing Mist'', Yu Jian, China]]
Another instance of abstraction in Chinese painting is seen in Zhu Derun's [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Zhu_Derun_-_Primordial_Chaos_(painting_only).jpeg ''Cosmic Circle'']. On the left side of this painting is a pine tree in rocky soil, its branches laced with vines that extend in a disorderly manner to the right side of the painting in which a perfect circle (probably made with help of a compass&lt;ref&gt;Watt, J. C. (2010). ''The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty''. Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;) floats in the void. The painting is a reflection of the [[Daoism|Daoist]] metaphysics in which chaos and reality are complementary stages of the regular course of nature.
In Tokugawa Japan some zen monk-painters created [[Enso]], a circle who represents the absolute enlightenment. Usually made in one spontaneous brush stroke, it became the paradigm of the minimalist aesthetic that guided part of the zen painting.

Patronage from the church diminished and private patronage from the public became more capable of providing a livelihood for artists.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich, "The Early Medici as Patrons of Art" in ''[[Norm and Form]]'', pp. 35–57, London, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Balfe, ed. ''Paying the Piper: Causes and Consequences of Art Patronage'', Univ. of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[art movement]]s which contributed to the development of abstract art were [[Romanticism]], [[Impressionism]] and [[Expressionism]]. Artistic independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. An ''objective interest in what is seen'', can be discerned from the paintings of [[John Constable]], [[J M W Turner]], [[Camille Corot]] and from them to the Impressionists who continued the ''[[plein air]]'' painting of the [[Barbizon school]].

A near abstraction, in 1877 Whistler sued the art critic [[John Ruskin]] for libel after the critic condemned this painting. Ruskin accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/rpower/archives/001951.html Whistler versus Ruskin, Princeton edu.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616062046/http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/rpower/archives/001951.html |date=June 16, 2010 }} Retrieved June 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/turnerwhistlermonet/wvr.htm From the Tate], retrieved April 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Early intimations of a new art had been made by [[James McNeill Whistler]] who, in his painting ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The falling Rocket]]'', (1872), placed greater emphasis on visual sensation than the depiction of objects.

[[Expressionism|Expressionist]] painters explored the bold use of paint surface, drawing distortions and exaggerations, and intense color. Expressionists produced emotionally charged paintings that were reactions to and perceptions of contemporary experience; and reactions to [[Impressionism]] and other more conservative directions of late 19th-century painting. The Expressionists drastically changed the emphasis on subject matter in favor of the portrayal of psychological states of being. Although artists like [[Edvard Munch]] and [[James Ensor]] drew influences principally from the work of the [[Post-Impressionists]] they were instrumental to the advent of abstraction in the 20th century.
[[Paul Cézanne]] had begun as an Impressionist but his aim – to make a logical construction of reality based on a view from a single point,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Read, ''A Concise History of Modern Art'', Thames and Hudson&lt;/ref&gt; with modulated color in flat areas – became the basis of a new visual art, later to be developed into [[Cubism]] by [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].

[[File:Yellow Curtain.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Le rideau jaune|The Yellow Curtain]]'', 1915. With his [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] color and drawing Matisse comes very close to pure abstraction.]] Additionally in the late 19th century in Eastern Europe [[mysticism]] and early [[Modernism|modernist]] religious philosophy as expressed by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky|Mme. Blavatsky]] had a profound impact on pioneer [[Geometric abstraction|geometric]] artists like [[Hilma af Klint]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. The mystical teaching of [[Georges Gurdjieff]] and [[P.D. Ouspensky]] also had an important influence on the early formations of the geometric abstract styles of [[Piet Mondrian]] and his colleagues in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Mondrian---mysticism---ldquo-My-long-search-is-over-rdquo--4237 |title=Hilton Kramer, "Mondrian &amp; mysticism: My long search is over", ''New Criterion'', September 1995 |publisher=Newcriterion.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th century ==
{{main article|Western painting|Fauvism|Cubism|}}

[[Post Impressionism]] as practiced by [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] had an enormous impact on [[20th-century art]] and led to the advent of 20th-century abstraction. The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of [[modern art]]. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. With his expressive use of color and his free and imaginative drawing Henri Matisse comes very close to pure abstraction in ''French Window at Collioure'' (1914), ''[[View of Notre-Dame]]'' (1914), and ''[[Le rideau jaune|The Yellow Curtain]]'' from 1915. The raw language of color as developed by the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] directly influenced another pioneer of abstraction, [[Wassily Kandinsky]].

Although [[Cubism]] ultimately depends upon subject matter, it became, along with [[Fauvism]], the art movement that directly opened the door to abstraction in the 20th century. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[Analytic cubism]] was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and others into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter. The collage artists like [[Kurt Schwitters]] and [[Man Ray]] and others taking the clue from [[Cubism]] were instrumental to the development of the movement called [[Dada]].

The Italian poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] published the [[Manifesto of Futurism]] in 1909, which later inspired artists such as [[Carlo Carra]] in ''Painting of Sounds, Noises and Smells'' and [[Umberto Boccioni]] ''Train in Motion'', 1911, to a further stage of abstraction that would, along with [[Cubism]], profoundly influenced art movements throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Tisdall and Angelo Bozzolla, ''Futurism'', Thames and Hudson, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1912 Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], where [[František Kupka]] exhibited the abstract painting ''Amorpha, Fugue en deux couleurs'' (''Fugue in Two Colors'') (1912), the poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] named the work of several artists including [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Section d'or, 1912–1920–1925'', Cécile Debray, Françoise Lucbert, Musées de Châteauroux, Musée Fabre, exhibition catalogue, Éditions Cercle d'art, Paris, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He defined it as, "the art of painting new structures out of elements that have not been borrowed from the visual sphere, but had been created entirely by the artist...it is a pure art."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison and Wood, ''Art in theory, 1900–2000'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2003, p. 189. {{ISBN|978-0631227083}}.[https://books.google.com/books?id=SWu4SB92fHMC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Apollinaire+on+Art books.google.com"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the turn of the century, cultural connections between artists of the major European cities had become extremely active as they strove to create an art form equal to the high aspirations of [[modernism]]. Ideas were able to cross-fertilize by means of artist's books, exhibitions and [[art manifesto|manifestos]] so that many sources were open to experimentation and discussion, and formed a basis for a diversity of modes of abstraction. The following extract from ''The World Backwards'' gives some impression of the inter-connectedness of culture at the time: "[[David Burliuk]]'s knowledge of modern art movements must have been extremely up-to-date, for the second [[Russian avant-garde|Knave of Diamonds exhibition]], held in January 1912 (in Moscow) included not only paintings sent from Munich, but some members of the German [[Die Brücke]] group, while from Paris came work by [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Fernand Léger]], as well as Picasso. During the Spring David Burliuk gave two lectures on cubism and planned a polemical publication, which the Knave of Diamonds was to finance.

And the search continued: The [[Rayonism|Rayist]] (Luchizm) drawings of [[Natalia Goncharova]] and [[Mikhail Larionov]], used lines like rays of light to make a construction. [[Kasimir Malevich]] completed his first entirely abstract work, the [[Suprematist]], ''Black Square'', in 1915. Another of the Suprematist group' [[Liubov Popova]], created the Architectonic Constructions and Spatial Force Constructions between 1916 and 1921. [[Piet Mondrian]] was evolving his abstract language, of horizontal and vertical lines with rectangles of color, between 1915 and 1919, [[Neo-Plasticism]] was the aesthetic which Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg and other in the group [[De Stijl]] intended to reshape the environment of the future.

== Music ==

As visual art becomes more abstract, it develops some characteristics of music: an art form which uses the abstract elements of sound and divisions of time. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], himself an amateur musician,&lt;ref&gt;Shawn, Allen. 2003. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qgqp5-EqEw8C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= Arnold Schoenberg's Journey]''. Harvard University Press. p. 62. {{ISBN|0674011015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Le Targat, ''Kandinsky'', Twentieth Century masters series, Random House Incorporated, 1987, p. 7, {{ISBN|0847808106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan B. Hirschfeld, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Hilla von Rebay Foundation, ''Watercolors by Kandinsky at the Guggenheim Museum: a selection from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Hilla von Rebay Foundation'', 1991. In 1871 the family moved to Odessa, where the young Kandinsky attended the Gymnasium and learned to play the cello and piano.&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by the possibility of marks and associative color ''resounding in the soul.'' The idea had been put forward by [[Charles Baudelaire]], that all our senses respond to various stimuli but the senses are connected at a deeper aesthetic level.

Closely related to this, is the idea that art has ''The spiritual dimension'' and can transcend 'every-day' experience, reaching a spiritual plane. The [[Theosophical Society]] popularized the ancient wisdom of the sacred books of India and China in the early years of the century. It was in this context that [[Piet Mondrian]], Wassily Kandinsky, [[Hilma af Klint]] and other artists working towards an 'objectless state' became interested in the occult as a way of creating an 'inner' object.
The universal and timeless shapes found in [[geometry]]: the circle, square and triangle become the spatial elements in abstract art; they are, like color, fundamental systems underlying visible reality.

== Russian avant-garde ==

[[File:Black Square.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kazimir Malevich]], ''Black Square'', 1923, [[The Russian Museum]]]]

{{main article|Russian avant-garde|Futurism (art)|}}

Many of the abstract artists in Russia became [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivists]] believing that art was no longer something remote, but life itself. The artist must become a technician, learning to use the tools and materials of modern production. ''Art into life!'' was [[Vladimir Tatlin]]'s slogan, and that of all the future Constructivists. [[Varvara Stepanova]] and Alexandre Exter and others abandoned easel painting and diverted their energies to theatre design and graphic works.
On the other side stood [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Anton Pevsner]] and [[Naum Gabo]]. They argued that art was essentially a spiritual activity; to create the individual's place in the world, not to organize life in a practical, materialistic sense. Many of those who were hostile to the materialist production idea of art left Russia. Anton Pevsner went to France, Gabo went first to Berlin, then to England and finally to America. Kandinsky studied in Moscow then left for the [[Bauhaus]]. By the mid-1920s the revolutionary period (1917 to 1921) when artists had been free to experiment was over; and by the 1930s only [[socialist realism]] was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Camilla Gray, ''The Russian Experiment in Art, 1863–1922'', Thames and Hudson, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Bauhaus ==

The [[Bauhaus]] at Weimar, Germany was founded in 1919 by [[Walter Gropius]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Gropius et al., ''Bauhaus 1919–1928'' Herbert Bayer ed., Museum of Modern Art,publ. Charles T Banford,Boston,1959&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy underlying the teaching program was unity of all the visual and plastic arts from architecture and painting to weaving and stained glass. This philosophy had grown from the ideas of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in England and the [[Deutscher Werkbund]]. Among the teachers were [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Johannes Itten]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Anni Albers]], and [[László Moholy-Nagy]]. In 1925 the school was moved to Dessau and, as the [[Nazi party]] gained control in 1932, The Bauhaus was closed. In 1937 an exhibition of [[degenerate art]], 'Entartete Kunst' contained all types of [[avant-garde]] art disapproved of by the Nazi party. Then the exodus began: not just from the Bauhaus but from Europe in general; to Paris, London and America. Paul Klee went to Switzerland but many of the artists at the Bauhaus went to America.

== Abstraction in Paris and London ==

[[File:DasUndbild.jpg|thumb|[[Kurt Schwitters]], ''Das Undbild'', 1919, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]]

During the 1930s Paris became the host to artists from Russia, Germany, the Netherlands and other European countries affected by the rise of [[totalitarianism]]. [[Sophie Tauber]] and [[Jean Arp]] collaborated on paintings and sculpture using organic/geometric forms. The Polish [[Katarzyna Kobro]] applied mathematically based ideas to sculpture. The many types of abstraction now in close proximity led to attempts by artists to analyse the various conceptual and aesthetic groupings. An exhibition by forty-six members of the [[Cercle et Carré]] group organized by [[Joaquin Torres-Garcia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seuphor|first1=Michel|title=Geometric Abstraccion 1926-1949|date=1972|publisher=Dallas Museum of Fine Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; assisted by [[Michel Seuphor]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Seuphor, ''Abstract Painting''&lt;/ref&gt; contained work by the Neo-Plasticists as well as abstractionists as varied as Kandinsky, Anton Pevsner and [[Kurt Schwitters]]. Criticized by [[Theo van Doesburg]] to be too indefinite a collection he published the journal ''Art Concret'' setting out a manifesto defining an abstract art in which the line, color and surface only, are the concrete reality.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Moszynska, ''Abstract Art'', p. 104, Thames and Hudson, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Abstraction-Création founded in 1931 as a more open group, provided a point of reference for abstract artists, as the political situation worsened in 1935, and artists again regrouped, many in London. The first exhibition of British abstract art was held in England in 1935. The following year the more international ''Abstract and Concrete'' exhibition was organized by [[Nicolete Gray]] including work by [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Ben Nicholson]]. Hepworth, Nicholson and Gabo moved to the [[St. Ives group]] in Cornwall to continue their 'constructivist' work.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Moszynska, ''Abstract Art'', Thames and Hudson, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

== America: mid-century ==
{{main article|Modernism|Late modernism|American Modernism|Surrealism|}}

[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1939-1942 - Composition 10.jpg|thumb|left|The above is a 1939–42 oil on canvas painting by Mondrian titled ''Composition No. 10''. Responding to it, fellow [[De Stijl]] artist [[Theo van Doesburg]] suggested a link between non-representational works of art and ideals of peace and spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Utopian Reality: Reconstructing Culture in Revolutionary Russia and Beyond; Christina Lodder, Maria Kokkori, Maria Mileeva; BRILL, Oct 24, 2013 "Van Doesburg stated that the purpose of art was to imbue man with those positive spiritual qualities that were needed in order to overcome the dominance of the physical and create the conditions for putting an end to wars. In an enthusiastic essay on Wassily Kandinsky he had written about the dialogue between the artist and the viewer, and the role of art as 'the educator of our inner life, the educator of our hearts and minds'. Van Doesburg subsequently adopted the view that the spiritual in man is nurtured specifically by abstract art, which he later described as 'pure thought, which does not signify a concept derived from natural phenomena but which is contained in numbers, measures, relationships, and abstract lines'. In his response to Piet Mondrian's ''Composition 10'', Van Doesburg linked peace and the spiritual to a non-representational work of art, asserting that 'it produces a most spiritual impression…the impression of repose: the repose of the soul'."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the Nazi rise to power in the 1930s many artists fled Europe to the United States. By the early 1940s the main movements in modern art, expressionism, cubism, abstraction, [[surrealism]], and [[dada]] were represented in New York: [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[André Masson]], [[Max Ernst]], [[André Breton]], were just a few of the exiled Europeans who arrived in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Naylor, ''The Bauhaus'', Studio Vista, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The rich cultural influences brought by the European artists were distilled and built upon by local New York painters. The climate of freedom in New York allowed all of these influences to flourish. The art galleries that primarily had focused on European art began to notice the local art community and the work of younger American artists who had begun to mature. Certain artists at this time became distinctly abstract in their mature work. During this period Piet Mondrian's painting ''Composition No. 10'', 1939–1942, characterized by primary colors, white ground and black grid lines clearly defined his radical but classical approach to the rectangle and abstract art in general.
Some artists of the period defied categorization, such as [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] who, while a modernist abstractionist, was a pure maverick in that she painted highly abstract forms while not joining any specific group of the period.

Eventually American artists who were working in a great diversity of styles began to coalesce into cohesive stylistic groups. The best known group of American artists became known as the [[Abstract expressionists]] and the [[New York School (art)|New York School]]. In New York City there was an atmosphere which encouraged discussion and there was new opportunity for learning and growing. Artists and teachers [[John D. Graham]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] became important bridge figures between the newly arrived European Modernists and the younger American artists coming of age. [[Mark Rothko]], born in Russia, began with strongly surrealist imagery which later dissolved into his powerful color compositions of the early 1950s. The [[action painting|expressionistic gesture]] and the act of painting itself, became of primary importance to [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Robert Motherwell]], and [[Franz Kline]]. While during the 1940s [[Arshile Gorky]]'s and [[Willem de Kooning]]'s figurative work evolved into abstraction by the end of the decade. New York City became the center, and artists worldwide gravitated towards it; from other places in America as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Geldzahler]], ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940–1970'', Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later developments ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
{{main article|Abstract expressionism|Color field|Lyrical abstraction|Post-painterly abstraction|Sculpture|Minimal art|}}

[[Digital art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[minimalism]], [[lyrical abstraction]], op art, abstract expressionism, color field painting, [[monochrome painting]], [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]], neo-Dada, [[shaped canvas]] painting, are a few directions relating to abstraction in the second half of the 20th century.

In the United States, ''Art as Object'' as seen in the [[Minimalist]] sculpture of [[Donald Judd]] and the paintings of [[Frank Stella]] are seen today as newer permutations. Other examples include [[Lyrical Abstraction]] and the sensuous use of color seen in the work of painters as diverse as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Patrick Heron]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Joan Mitchell]].

== Causation ==

One socio-historical explanation that has been offered for the growing prevalence of the abstract in modern art – an explanation linked to the name of [[Theodor W. Adorno]] – is that such abstraction is a response to, and a reflection of, the growing abstraction of social relations in [[industrial society]].&lt;ref&gt;David Cunningham, 'Asceticism Against Colour', in ''New Formations'' 55 (2005) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederic Jameson]] similarly sees modernist abstraction as a function of the abstract power of money, equating all things equally as exchange-values.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; The social ''content'' of abstract art is then precisely the abstract nature of social existence – legal formalities, bureaucratic impersonalization, information/power – in the world of [[late modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Analytical psychology#Post-Jungian approaches|Post-Jungians]] by contrast would see the quantum theories with their disintegration of conventional ideas of form and matter as underlying the divorce of the concrete and the abstract in modern art.&lt;ref&gt;Aniela Jaffé, in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) pp. 288–89, 303&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Adoro te devote'''" is a [[Eucharistic]] [[hymn]] written by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/11358879/Not-a-hymn-but-a-personal-poem.html Christopher Howse, 'Not a hymn but a personal poem,']. ''The Telegraph''. 17 Jan 2015. retrieved 5 Nov 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; "Adoro te devote" is one of the five Eucharistic hymns, which were composed and set to music for the Solemnity of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]], instituted in 1264 by [[Pope Urban IV]] as a [[Solemnity]] for the entire [[Roman Catholic Church]].

Since the beginning of its composition and it being set to music, the "Adoro te devote" was chanted as an Eucharistic Hymn during the Saint Mass ''in honorem SS. Sacramenti'' (in honour of the Most [[Blessed Sacrament]]), as it was written in the Latin manuscripts. So it was also chanted for the [[Eucharistic adoration]].

Strictly speaking, Aquinas seems to have used it also as a private prayer, for a daily adoration of the Blessed Sacrament.

The "Adoro te devote" is one of the medieval poetic compositions, being used as spoken prayers and also as chanted hymns, which were preserved in the [[Tridentine Mass|''Missale Romanum'']] published in 1570 following the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563).

The "Adoro te devote" is still sung today, though its use is optional in the post-[[Vatican II]] [[Mass of Paul VI|Ordinary form]].

There are two&lt;ref name= "Zenith.org_May 23, 2010" /&gt; variant readings of the Latin text, with slightly different nuances to some of the words: 
''"most of the variations occur in the first two verses.

: Prostrate I adore Thee, Deity unseen,
: Who Thy glory hidest 'neath these shadows mean;
: Lo, to Thee surrendered, my whole heart is bowed,
: Tranced as it beholds Thee, shrined within the cloud.

: Taste, and touch, and vision, to discern Thee fail;
: Faith, that comes by hearing, pierces through the veil.
: I believe whate'er the Son of God hath told;
: What the Truth hath spoken, that for truth I hold.

: On the Cross lay hidden but thy Deity,
: Here is hidden also Thy Humanity:
: But in both believing and confessing, Lord,
: Ask I what the dying thief of Thee implored.

: Thy dread wounds, like Thomas, though I cannot see,
: His be my confession, Lord and God, of Thee,
: Make my faith unfeigned ever-more increase,
: Give me hope unfading, love that cannot cease.

: O memorial wondrous of the Lord's own death;
: Living Bread, that giveth all Thy creatures breath,
: Grant my spirit ever by Thy life may live,
: To my taste Thy sweetness never-failing give.

: [[Pelican#Religion, mythology, and popular culture|Pelican]] of mercy, Jesus, Lord and God,
: Cleanse me, wretched sinner, in Thy Precious Blood:
: Blood where one drop for human-kind outpoured
: Might from all transgression have the world restored.

: Jesus, whom now veiled, I by faith descry,
: What my soul doth thirst for, do not, Lord, deny,
: That thy face unveiled, I at last may see,
: With the blissful vision blest, my God, of Thee. Amen.
|
:O Godhead hid, devoutly I adore Thee,
:Who truly art within the forms before me; 
:To Thee my heart I bow with bended knee, 
:As failing quite in contemplating Thee.

:Sight, touch, and taste in Thee are each deceived; 
:The ear alone most safely is believed: 
:I believe all the Son of God has spoken,
:Than Truth's own word there is no truer token.

:God only on the Cross lay hid from view; 
:But here lies hid at once the Manhood too:
:And I, in both professing my belief,
:Make the same prayer as the repentant thief.

:Thy wounds, as Thomas saw, I do not see; 
:Yet Thee confess my Lord and God to be: 
:Make me believe Thee ever more and more; 
:In Thee my hope, in Thee my love to store.

:O thou Memorial of our Lord's own dying! 
:O Bread that living art and vivifying! 
:Make ever Thou my soul on Thee to live; 
:Ever a taste of Heavenly sweetness give.

:O loving Pelican! O Jesu, Lord! 
:Unclean I am, but cleanse me in Thy Blood;
:Of which a single drop, for sinners spilt,
:Is ransom for a world's entire guilt.

:Godhead here in hiding, whom I do adore,
:Masked by these bare shadows, shape and nothing more,
:See, Lord, at thy service low lies here a heart
:Lost, all lost in wonder at the God thou art.

:Seeing, touching, tasting are in thee deceived:
:How says trusty hearing? that shall be believed;
:What God’s Son has told me, take for truth I do;
:Truth himself speaks truly or there’s nothing true.

:On the cross thy godhead made no sign to men,
:Here thy very manhood steals from human ken:
:Both are my confession, both are my belief,
:And I pray the prayer of the dying thief.

:I am not like Thomas, wounds I cannot see,
:But can plainly call thee Lord and God as he;
:Let me to a deeper faith daily nearer move,
:Daily make me harder hope and dearer love.

:O thou our reminder of Christ crucified,
:Living Bread, the life of us for whom he died,
:Lend this life to me then: feed and feast my mind,
:There be thou the sweetness man was meant to find.

:Bring the tender tale true of the Pelican;
:Bathe me, Jesu Lord, in what thy bosom ran—
:Blood whereof a single drop has power to win
:All the world forgiveness of its world of sin.

:Jesu, whom I look at shrouded here below,
:I beseech thee send me what I thirst for so,
:Some day to gaze on thee face to face in light

Additional translations, with their opening line, are as follows: 
:[[John O'Hagan]] (1822-1890) [http://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/Hymni/AdoroTe.html Hidden God, devoutly I adore thee]

== Liturgical use ==
This hymn was added to the [[Roman Missal]] in 1570 by [[Pope Pius V]], and also it has more quotations in the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (n. 1381).

This Eucharistic hymn was generally chanted with a [[genuflection]] in front of the Blessed Sacrament, which is Jesus Christ God, the Lord and the Saviour, the [[Saint]] King, [[King of Israel]] and [[King of Kings]]. 

It was much more like than what is written in the Bible for the [[Sanctus]], something generally chanted in [[Heaven]] by the [[hierarchy of angels|angelic hierarchies]].

The hymn is typically used as an Eucharistic hymn and is sung either during the distribution of communion at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], or during the [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]].

== Final prayer ==
Until the first half of the nineteenth century, the (Eucharistic) chant ''Adoro Te devote'' was often used to be followed by this second [[Thanksgiving]] prayer, referred to Jesus Christ God:

:''Obsecro Te, sancte Domine Jesu''
:''Christe, ut passio tua sit mihi virtus''
:''qua muniar atque defendar,''
:''vulnera tua sit mihi cibus potusque''
:''quibus pascar, inebrier atque delecter;''
:''aspersio sanguinis tui sit mihi ablutio''
:''omnium delictorum meorum;''
:''resurrectio tua sit mihi gloria''
:''sempiterna. In his sit mihi refectio,''
:''exultatio sanitas et dulcedo''
:''cordis mei. Qui vivis et regnas in''
:''unitate Patri et Spiritus Sancti Deus''
:''per omnia saecula saeculorum''.
:''Amen.''

The 13 December 1849, Pope [[Pio IX]] stated a period of some days of [[indulgence]] in favour of any Christian people having declaimed this prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Riva, ''Manuale di Filotea'', Milano, 1860, pag. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blatt auf Rote Beete.jpg|thumb|Rhododendron leaf and ivy leaf on photo paper for printers, sensitized with beetroot juice 10x15 cm]]
[[File:Ahornblatt (Anthotypie).jpg|thumb|Maple leaf, anthotype with sour cherry juice, 2 h exposure time at high noon in summer time]]
An '''anthotype''' is an [[image]] created using [[photosensitive]] material from [[plants]]. This  process was originally invented by [[Sir John Herschel]] in 1842. An [[emulsion]] is made from crushed flower petals or any other light-sensitive plant, fruit or vegetable. A coated sheet of paper is then dried. Place some material, for example leaves or a transparent photo positive on the paper and expose to direct full sunlight until the image part not covered by the material is bleached out by the sun rays. The color remains or fades  in the shadowed parts. The paper remains sensitive against such rays.

==History==
The photo-sensitive properties of plants and vegetables have been known to scholars for centuries. Among many early observations the experiments of [[Henri August Vogel]] in [[Paris]] are of particular interest. He discovered in 1816:

An alcoholic [[tincture]] of either red [[carnation]]s, [[violet (plant)|violet]]s or [[corn poppy]] turned white behind blue glass in a few days, while it remained unchanged behind red glass after about the same time. Cotton and paper colored with these tinctures exhibited the same differences.

Later that century Herschel attempted to invent a color process, he tried several flower and plant emulsions and published his findings. His research resulted in the anthotype process. It should be pointed out that his research into making photographic images from flowers was limited and was ultimately abandoned since no commercial application was feasible from a process which takes days to produce an image. The process continued to be listed in photographic literature of the time but was likely little used.

Over time the process has earned a misleading reputation for being simply too impractical. Image permanence have been brought into question to this day but this problem seems to be mostly related to choice of flower or plant matter.

==How it works==
{{quote|From an examination of the researches of Sir John Herschel on the coloring matter of plants, it will be seen that the action of the sun's rays is to destroy the color, effecting a sort of [[chromatic analysis]], in which two distinct elements of color are separated, by destroying the one and leaving the other. The action is confined within the [[visible spectrum]], and thus a broad distinction is exhibited between the action of the sun's rays on vegetable juices and on [[Silver|argentine]] compounds, the latter being most sensibly affected by the invisible rays beyond the violet. 
It may also be observed, that the rays effective in destroying a given tint, are in a great many cases, those whose union produces a color complementary to the tint destroyed, or, at least, one belonging to that class of colors to which such complementary tint may be preferred. For instance, yellows tending towards orange are destroyed with more energy by the blue rays; blues by the red, orange and yellow rays; purples and pinks by yellow and green rays.|Henry H. Snelling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/tech/photography/HistoryandPracticeoftheArtofPhotography/chap4.html |title=History and Practice of the Art of Photography - Chapter III |publisher=Worldwideschool.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other flower suggestions==
Henry H. Snelling writes based on his research: "[[Viola odorata]]--or sweet scented violet, yields to alcohol a rich blue color, which it imparts in high perfection to paper. [[Senecio Splendens]] -- or double purple [[Senecio vulgaris|groundsel]], yields a beautiful color to paper."

Bingham, quoting by [[John Herschel|Sir John Herschel]], recommends Corchorus japonicus flower (japanese Jute) for a "''fine yellow colour''" that "''upon exposure to sunlight, it is in about half an hour rendered quite white''". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/photogenicmanipu00bing|title=Photogenic manipulation. containing the theory and plain instructions in the art of photography, or the production of pictures through the agency of light : including calotype, fluorotype, ferrotype, chromotype, chrysotype, cyanotype, catalissisotype and anthotype|last=Bingham|first=Robert J.|date=1847|publisher=London : George Knight and Sons|others=Getty Research Institute|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[culture of Tunisia]] is thousands of years old, but the 2011 [[Tunisian revolution]] brought about important changes to the way art and politics interact in [[Tunisia]]. Censorship under the dictatorship of former president [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] was replaced with unprecedented freedom of expression and questions on how to use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rhodes|first=Emile|title=La culture tunisienne fait sa révolution|url=http://www.slateafrique.com/1763/culture-tunisienne-fait-revolution|accessdate=20 April 2013|newspaper=Slate Afrique|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The newfound vigorousness of the arts in Tunisia and the new challenges artists have to address echo those in other countries affected by the [[Arab Spring]], especially [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Demerdash|first=Nancy|title=Consuming Revolution: Ethics, Art, and Ambivalence in the Arab Spring|url=http://www.brismes.ac.uk/nmes/consuming-revolutionethics-art-and-ambivalence-in-the-arab-spring#1|publisher=British Society for Middle Eastern Studies|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Art before the Tunisian revolution===

Artists found ways to circumvent or avoid censorship of their work before the downfall of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rhodes|first=Emile|title=Quand les artistes se jouaient de Ben Ali|url=http://www.slateafrique.com/1665/les-arts-pour-contourner-censure-ben-ali|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=Slate Afrique|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tunisian collaborative painting]], for instance, is an art form created in Tunisia during the 1980s that allows several artists to collaborate on one piece without prior discussion or planning. Although the Tunisian art market was relatively small and inward looking compared to the ones in other North African countries like [[Morocco]] or [[Algeria]], there was proof of an evolving, dynamic art scene even before the revolution, with the successes of [http://galerie-elmarsa.com/ang/index.html Galerie El Marsa] or [http://www.leviolonbleu.com/ Le Violon Bleu].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ben Soltane|first=Mohamed|title=Art in Tunisia: a visibility in the making|date=14 September 2010|url=https://www.academia.edu/617582/Art_in_Tunisia_A_visibility_in_the_making|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, according to Khadija Hamdi: "In Tunisia, with the absence, among other things, of a cultural policy specific to the art market, and the lack of the appropriate cultural and ideological conditions, the emergence of a "system" of "contemporary art" itself (in the Western sense) has not yet been possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamdi|first=Khadija|title=On the path of contemporary Tunisian art|url=http://www.ismailbahri.lautre.net/files/on-the-path-of-tunisian-art-en-2011.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain artistic institutions such as the school of music in [[El Kef]] were closed by the regime as potential hotbeds of discord.

===Art during and after the Tunisian revolution===

Works of art that used the revolution as a subject proliferated after the downfall of the former regime, both to emulate iconic revolutionary symbols and to explore the complex challenges the country still faced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shilton|first=Siobhán|title=Art and the ‘Arab Spring’: Aesthetics of revolution in contemporary Tunisia|journal=French Cultural Studies|date=29 January 2013|volume=24|issue=1|pages=129–145|doi=10.1177/0957155812464166|url=http://frc.sagepub.com/content/24/1/129|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution saw an upshot in the number of artistic manifestations such as exhibits, most notably in the field of [[photography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Triki|first=Rachida|title=Tunisia: A Dynamic and Vigilant Art Scene|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2012/tunisia_art_scene|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Nafas Art Magazine|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other art forms such as music also thrived after the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kraft|first=Jessica C.|title=After the revolution, arts bloom in Tunisia|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Music/2012/0209/After-the-revolution-arts-bloom-in-Tunisia|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remnants from the older regime and from the demonstrations themselves were also used by artists during the revolution, by transforming a police station into an art gallery or transforming burnt out cars into works of art, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Metwaly|first=Ati|title=Police station in Tunisia turned into an art gallery|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/35/20023/Arts--Culture/Stage--Street/Police-station-in-Tunisia-turned-into-an-art-galle.aspx|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Ahram Online|date=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ben Miled|first=Zied|title=Burnt out cars turned into artistic pieces in Tunisian revolution|url=http://www.demotix.com/news/1580613/burnt-out-cars-turned-artistic-pieces-tunisian-revolution#media-1580588|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Demotix|date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villas belonging to the Trabelsis, the family of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's wife [[Leïla Ben Ali]], became the target of graffiti artists soon after the regime's downfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les graffeurs tunisiens s'invitent dans les villas Trabelsi|url=http://www.slateafrique.com/8285/des-graffeurs-tunisiens-tagguent-les-villas-des-trabelsi|accessdate=20 April 2013|newspaper=Slate Afrique|date=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Street art====

In the months during and following the revolution, [[street art]] played a major role by reclaiming public spaces that used to be controlled by the government and by letting artists and ordinary citizens express themselves freely for the first time in years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Galliot|first=Lorena|title=Graffiti artists show their support for the Tunisian revolution|url=http://observers.france24.com/content/20110606-graffiti-artists-show-support-tunisian-revolution|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=France 24|date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual artists or groups like the student-run Ahl El Kahf collective used stencils, graffitis and paintings to depict political or revolutionary themes, such as the portrait of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Galliot|first=Lorena|title=Graffiti artists show their support for the Tunisian revolution|url=http://observers.france24.com/content/20110606-graffiti-artists-show-support-tunisian-revolution|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=France 24|date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to using local revolutionary symbols, street artists also reused Western and Latin American revolutionary icons in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rodrigues|first=Jill|title=Revolutionary Art on the Streets of Tunisia|url=http://pdq.rwu.edu/news/revolutionary-art-streets-tunisia|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Roger Williams University|date=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murals were one of the most common form of street art, representing, for instance, people killed during the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Letsinger|first=Brandon|title=Creating the Political: Street Art after the Tunisia Revolution|url=http://letsingerwrites.com/2011/10/29/creating-the-political-art-after-revolution-part-1/|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nicholas Korody, "The graffiti of the Tunisian revolution always possesses a revolutionary character in form. That is to say, it existed as a reappropriation of authoritarian-controlled property. It is also notable in that it is the only art form born out of the revolution. While a few artists existed in Tunisia during the Ben Ali regime, their work was quickly covered up and few people knew about the art form. Since the revolution, it has grown massively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Korody|first=Nicholas|title=The Revolutionary Art: Street Art Before and After the Tunisian Revolution|journal=Independent Study Project|date=7 December 2011|url=http://digitalcollections.sit.edu/isp_collection/1134|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Academic Response'''

The revolution in Tunisia and its aftermath has prompted much discussion. Tunisian intellectual, Dr. Mohamed-Salah Omri, a fellow at University of Oxford in Modern Arabic literature, has dedicated much of his research to examining the intersections between [https://www.academia.edu/5200885/A_Revolution_of_Dignity_and_Poetry poetry and revolution], the [https://www.academia.edu/30462852/Confluency_tarafud_between_trade_unionism_culture_and_revolution_in_Tunisia "Confluency"] between Culture, Revolution and [https://www.academia.edu/5208539/Trade_Unions_and_the_construction_of_a_specifically_Tunisian_protest_configuration Trade Unionism in Tunisia],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Omri|first=Mohamed-Salah|title=Trade Unions and the construction of a specifically Tunisian protest configuration|url=https://www.academia.edu/5208539/Trade_Unions_and_the_construction_of_a_specifically_Tunisian_protest_configuration|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the overall challenges of [https://www.academia.edu/9808087/Tunisias_revolution_of_dignity_and_freedom_cannot_be_colour-codedhttp_www.tni.org_article_tunisia-revolution-dignity-and-freedom-can-not-be-colour-coded the democratic transition in the country].

==New challenges==

===Religious challenges to artistic freedom===

Despite the end of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's dictatorship, Tunisian artists have faced new challenges to their artistic freedom, often from groups that have a strict interpretation of [[Islam]]. After years of censorship and repression of both the art world and religious identity, the new regime has had to juggle between the two, and tensions have periodically surfaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tunisian artists use graffiti to fight religious extremism|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/09/07/236596.html|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012 riots erupted against the "Printemps des Arts" exhibit in [[La Marsa]] that [[Salafi]] groups and others deemed blasphemous, most notably because of one work of art that spelled out [[God]]'s name using insects. Hundreds were arrested and curfews were imposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amara|first=Tarek|title=Islamists riot over "insulting" art|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/06/12/uk-tunisia-salafis-clash-idUKBRE85B0XP20120612|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=12 June 2012|author2=Lin Noueihed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some radical religious leaders called for the deaths of the artists, who received death threats, and Tunisian minister of culture [[Mehdi Mabrouk]] condemned the artists by saying that art should be "beautiful," not "revolutionary," and that the artists were wrong to invoke Islamic imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Larkins|first=Zoe|title=Under New Regime, Tunisian Artists Face New Censorship|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/news/2012-06-26/tunisia-censorship/|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Art in America|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of the ruling [[Ennahda Movement]], [[Rachid Ghannouchi]], said that he condemned violence against individuals or property but also opposed "attacks on the beliefs of Tunisians" and emphasized the need to protect "sacred symbols".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Yasmine|title=Tunisia's embattled artists speak out|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/06/2012615111819112421.html|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also deemed blasphemous by some was a work of art by Nadia Jelassi, who created an installation of female mannequin busts, cloaked in [[hijab]]s and surrounded by stones. Jelassi, a teacher at the [[Tunis Institute of Fine Arts]], was called to appear before a judge and was charged for disturbing public order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beardsley|first=Eleanor|title=Tunisians Battle Over The Meaning Of Free Expression|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/28/161906865/tunisians-battle-over-the-meaning-of-free-expression|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=NPR|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her treatment - police took her fingerprints and a mugshot - sparked an online campaign in defense of free expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weslaty|first=Lilia|title=Tunisia: Artists on the offensive with photo campaign|url=http://nawaat.org/portail/2012/09/10/tunisia-artists-on-the-offensive-with-photo-campaign/|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Nawaat|date=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the incident, the artistic community complained that authorities weren't doing enough to protect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Gareth|title=After Islamist riots triggered by contemporary art fair, tensions remain high in Tunis|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/After-Islamist-riots-triggered-by-contemporary-art-fair-tensions-remain-high-in-Tunis-/26913|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious hardliners tried and sometimes succeeded to prevent other artistic events from taking place like music festivals and plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amara|first=Tarek|title=Tunisian artists cry for help against religious extremists|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/19/us-tunisia-salafi-art-idUSBRE88I0SM20120919|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women artists in particular feared that hardline Muslim pressure would prevent them from working freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dettmer|first=Jamie|title=Tunisia's Female Artists Fear Islamist Repression|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/tunisia-female-artist-fear-islamist-repression/1617944.html|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Voice of America|date=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These tensions led many to feel that "nothing had changed" with regards to the relations between art and politics, as censorship is said to have shifted from being political to being religious and moral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jurich|first=Joscelyn|title=Revolution Hasn’t Changed Artistic Censorship in Tunisia|url=http://hyperallergic.com/63757/revolution-hasnt-changed-artistic-censorship-in-tunisia/|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Hyperallergic|date=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Sofiane Ouissi, co-creative director of the Dream City, an art festival that takes place in Tunis' medina: "Under the old censorship and oppression - it was conspicuous; we could locate it; it was clear for us. [...] But now, since it was displaced, it has come into the public space, you never know where dictatorship is going to emerge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fordham|first=Alice|title=The battle for Tunisia's art and soul|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/africa/the-battle-for-tunisias-art-and-soul#full|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=The National|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political challenges to artistic freedom===

Artists have also been targeted by the new regime. In November 2012, Chahine Berriche and Oussama Bouagila, two Tunisian graffiti artists, were arrested for writing "the people want rights for the poor" and "the poor are the living-dead in Tunisia" on the wall of a university. The two artists were members of the Zwelwa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hendoud |first=Henda |title=Tunisie – Zwewla, le graffiti se révolte |url=http://blog.slateafrique.com/tawa-fi-tunis/2012/11/19/tunisie-%E2%80%93-zewla-le-graffiti-se-revolte/ |accessdate=20 April 2013 |newspaper=Slate Afrique |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122053405/http://blog.slateafrique.com/tawa-fi-tunis/2012/11/19/tunisie-%E2%80%93-zewla-le-graffiti-se-revolte/ |archivedate=22 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  art activist collective and were charged with breaching the state of emergency, writing on public property and disturbing public order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ajmi|first=Sana|title=Tunisian graffiti artists targeted by law|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/sana-ajmi/tunisian-graffiti-artists-targeted-by-law|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Open Democracy|date=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempts to address challenges===

Tunisian street artists [[eL Seed]] reacted to these tensions between the artistic and religious communities by painting verses of the [[Quran]] preaching tolerance onto the Jara [[mosque]] in his hometown of [[Gabès]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Catriona|title=Tunisian artist graffitis minaret, fights intolerance|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/19/world/meast/el-seed-grafitti-minaret|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also said that the threat of censorship was exaggerated in certain circles: "I feel that there is a lot of hypocrisy in Tunisia at the moment, and unfortunately many artists relish censorship, or the fear of it, if it brings them international recognition. I personally have not felt any real threats of censorship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rao|first=Mallika|title=El Seed On Graffiti, Censorship In Tunisia, And Why Arabic Is An Artist's Best Friend|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/27/el-seed-tunisian-graffiti-artist_n_1918493.html|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New art institutions and organizations==

The [http://www.bchirartcenter.com/ B’chira Art Center], located near [[Sidi Thabet]] between [[Tunis]] and [[Bizerte]], opened in July 2011. The center aimed to develop contemporary art by providing a space for artists to produce and show work, as well as an experimental laboratory to research techniques and introduce children to the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ben Zineb |first=Sayda |title=Un lieu où se développent les pratiques artistiques contemporaines |url=http://www.letemps.com.tn/article-57952.html |accessdate=19 April 2013 |newspaper=Le Temps |date=31 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801091812/http://www.letemps.com.tn/article-57952.html |archivedate=1 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Carthage National Museum]] saw the launch of an umbrella program called [http://www.carthagecontemporary.com/ Carthage Contemporary], part of an increasingly dynamic contemporary art scene in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Milliard|first=Coline|title=From the Ashes of Tunisia's Revolution, A Contemporary Art Scene Grows: A Q&amp;A With Curator Khadija Hamdi|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/805447/from-the-ashes-of-tunisias-revolution-a-contemporary-art-scene-grows-a-qa-with-curator-khadija-hamdi|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Artinfo UK|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also established after the revolution in 2011 was the Tunisian Federation of the Visual Arts (Fédération Tunisienne des Arts Plastiques), a grouping of young artist associations aimed at defending and promoting visual arts in Tunisia. These goals are shared by two preexisting organizations, the Association of Tunisian Visual Artists (Union des Artistes Plasticiens Tunisiens) and the Union of Visual Arts Professions (Syndicat des Métiers des Arts Plastiques), created in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Triki|first=Rachida|title=Tunisia: A Dynamic and Vigilant Art Scene|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2012/tunisia_art_scene|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Nafas Art Magazine|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International influences and projects==

===In Tunisia===

French street artist and photographer [[JR (artist)|JR]] launched the first phase of his [[Inside Out Project]] in Tunisia, where native photographers displayed large scale portraits of ordinary Tunisians around the country instead of the formerly ubiquitous pictures of the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artocracy in Tunisia|url=http://www.jr-art.net/projects/artocracy-in-tunisia|publisher=JR|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project fostered discussion with Tunisians, some of whom understood and appreciated the project, while others did not think art should play a political role by using public spaces and complained that the previous regime already imposed pictures upon them all the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Yasmine|title=Art challenges Tunisian revolutionaries|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/03/201132223217876176.html|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bell|first=Melissa|title=Tunisia and the art revolution|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/tunisia-and-the-art-revolution/2011/03/25/AFhnT5WB_blog.html|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algerian-French artist ZOO Project also celebrated the revolution by placing hundreds of life-size figures around the city, representing the Tunisians who revolted and in particular those who died during the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Eugene|last=Kim|title=Revolutionary Tunisian Street Art|url=http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/revolutionary-tunisian-street|publisher=My Modern Met|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abroad===

Tunisian artists also explored political and revolutionary themes in exhibits abroad. In France, the [[Institut du Monde Arabe]] hosted two events. In May 2011, an exhibit called "Dégage" (French for "get lost") showcased photographs of the revolution by a Tunisian photography collective of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="DÉGAGE", COLLECTIF DE PHOTOGRAPHES TUNISIENS|url=http://www.imarabe.org/exposition-ima-degage#|publisher=Institut du Monde Arabe|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Farhat|first=Mehdi|title=Le collectif Dégage révèle sa révolution|url=http://www.slateafrique.com/2203/collectif-degage-revele-revolution|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Slate Afrique|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second exhibit that ran from January to April 2012 called "Dégagements – Tunisia One Year On"  showed work from Tunisian artists and others from the Middle East to celebrate the anniversary of the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DÉGAGEMENTS... LA TUNISIE UN AN APRÈS|url=http://www.imarabe.org/exposition/degagements-la-tunisie-un-apres|publisher=Institut du Monde Arabe|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included paintings, graffiti, pictures and sculptures by artists like cartoonist Nadia Kiari and photographer [[Hichem Driss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Charlton|first=Emma|title=Art dissects Tunisia's revolution, one year on|url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/features/art-dissects-tunisias-revolution-one-year-on_5086|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=AFP|date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Tunisian student Ikram Lakhdhar curated an exhibit at Connecticut College called "Moments of Freedom: Revolutionary Art from China, South Africa and Tunisia" in April 2013 with work by contemporary Tunisian photographers Wassim Grimen, Omar Sfayhi, and Youssef Ben Ammar and internationally renown artists such as [[Diane Victor]], [[Zhang Hongtu]], [[Rajaa Gharbi]] and [[William Kentridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  news|last=Smadhi|first=Asma|title=Tunisian Student Organizes Revolutionary Art Exhibit in US|url=http://www.tunisia-live.net/2013/04/02/tunisian-student-organizes-revolutionary-art-exhibit-in-us/|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Tunisia Live|date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]], the ifa Gallery in [[Stuttgart]] hosted an exhibit from January to March 2013 called "Rosy Future" on the future of contemporary art in Tunisia after the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ROSY FUTURE – CONTEMPORARY ART FROM TUNISIA |url=http://www.contemporaryand.com/blog/exhibition/rosy-future-contemporary-art-from-tunisia/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130628223624/http://www.contemporaryand.com/blog/exhibition/rosy-future-contemporary-art-from-tunisia/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 June 2013 |publisher=Contemporary &amp; |accessdate=19 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meszlényi Attila''' (born 2 May 1954 in Budapest) is an ecological writer, painter, animated film director, musician,&lt;ref name="Attila Meszlényi plays on musette"&gt;{{cite web|title=Attila Meszlényi plays on musette|url=https://www.discogs.com/M%C3%A1ria-Z%C3%A1dori-P%C3%A1l-N%C3%A9meth-Capella-Savaria-Savaria-Vocal-Ensemble-Puer-Natus-In-Betlehem-Barque-Mus/release/7783944}}&lt;/ref&gt; and composer. His work as a painter and thinker is dominated by the theme of nature and our{{ambiguous|date=March 2017}} relation to it.

Attila Meszlényi has lived in seclusion since 2006. He prefers not to exhibit his work, publishing only on the Internet.&lt;ref name="Paintings of Attila Meszlényi "&gt;{{cite web|title=Paintings of Attila Meszlényi|url=http://attila-meszlenyi.pixels.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; His more recent works in relation to the ecology topic are available in parts online. Meszlényi Attila states: “every piece of work is worthy of respect only if it creates more value then it destroys; the canvas coated in paint by itself is no more valuable then the flax and cotton it is made of.” __TOC__

== Career ==
Graduated in applied graphic arts from Képző- és Iparművészeti Szakközépiskola (Fine and Applied Arts School) in 1972. Against his parents’ and teachers’ wishes, he did not continue his education as he did not want to move away from everyday life. He also believed that self-education was worth more than institutional education. He spent the following years doing various, mostly physical jobs such as baker, stone sculptor, decorator, plumber etc. He continued his art activities in his free time beginning to turn towards films.

Attila Meszlényi took part in a study called ‘A magyar film formanyelve és közleménye’ about film semiotics in cooperation with [[:hu:Beke László|László Beke]], [[:hu:Horányi Özséb|Özséb Horányi]], [[:hu:Lányi András (író)|András Lányi]] and Róbert Vadas led by Péter Józsa. Spotted by Foky Ottó, he started directing animated films in [[Pannonia Film Studio|Pannónia Filmstúdió]] from 1977 to ’79, mostly parts of the popular cartoon series ‘Frakk, a macskák réme’,.&lt;ref name="Frakk, a macskák réme"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frakk, a macskák réme|url=https://widgets.imdb.com/title/tt0167595/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frakk(TV Series)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frakk (TV Series)|url=http://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film824919.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the series ended, he started working as a freelance graphic designer. Made covers and illustrations for no less than two hundred books, drew many slide films, occasionally took commercial graphic design work orders as well. Since 1980, he is member of [[:hu:Magyar Alkotóművészeti Közalapítvány|Művészeti Alap]] (Artist Fund) and its successor organisation [[:hu:Magyar Alkotóművészek Országos Egyesülete|Magyar Alkotóművészek Országos Egyesülete]] (National Association of Hungarian Artists).

In 1983, he founded an [[early music]] ensemble, Musica Profana, in which he played the [[Baroque flute]] and [[Musette de cour|musette]] till 1993.

Due to the instigation of Muray Róbert and Dr. Zoltán Attila, from 1987, he started painting wild birds and mammals of Europe and occasionally other continents, mixing naturalist depiction with various stylistic elements.

In 1990, he founded (and has been leading ever since) the TARON TÁRSASÁG (called Gondolkodókör after 2001).
Between 1998 and 2006, he was a regular participant of national exhibitions, fine art biennales. He keeps painting animals, animal and plant remains using watercolour or oil. Since 1999, he has been member of the Magyar Vízfestők Társasága (Association of the Hungarian Watercolour Painters).&lt;ref name="Association of the Hungarian Watercolour Painters"&gt;{{cite web|title=Association of the Hungarian Watercolour Painters|url=https://www.facebook.com/MagyarVizfestokTarsasaga/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded the Unikornis fine art group with Péchy Tamás in 2001. Its members: Csíkszentmihályi Róbert sculptor, Nagy Judit gobelin artist, Nemes István painter and graphic artist, Szemadám György fine artist, Péchy Tamás environmentalist and Sárosdy Judit art historian.
In recent years, he has mainly been painting and publishing his art-, ecology-themed books, writings.

'''''Avenue of Chestnut Trees at La Celle-Saint-Cloud''''' (French - ''Allée de châtaigniers à La Celle-Saint-Cloud'') or  '''''Edge of the Fontainebleau Forest''''' (''Lisière de la forêt de Fontainebleau'') is an 1865 pre-[[Impressionist]] painting by [[Alfred Sisley]], produced in the woods at [[La Celle-Saint-Cloud]]. It was refused by the [[Paris Salon]] of 1867 and bought by [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]] in 1877. It was acquired in 1919 by [[Joseph Duveen]], who in 1921 gave it to the [[Petit Palais]], where it still hangs.

==Life and career==

Born on 2 October 1914 in [[Battersea]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], Bernarr Rainbow was the son of Ephraim James Rainbow (1888-1983), a cabinet-maker at [[Buckingham Palace]], who later became the Curator of pictures at [[Hampton Court]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainbow first became a church chorister when his family moved to [[Clapham]], and he was intrigued by watching the organist play. 

After another move he attended [[Rutlish School]] in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]]. Even though he still at school, Bernarr was appointed the organist and choirmaster at St James's, Merton, later holding similar posts at St Mary's, East Molesey and St Andrew's, Wimbledon.&lt;ref name ="ODNB"/&gt;

After his family moved to Hampton Court, Bernarr attended [[Trinity College of Music]] between 1933–1939, where he was a pupil of Dr [[William Lovelock]].&lt;ref name ="Independent"&gt;{{Cite news

In September 1944 he became Organist of the Parish Church of All Saints, High Wycombe and, a few months later, the Senior Music Master at [[Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe]].&lt;ref name="appreciation"/&gt; He made a considerable public impact at High Wycombe. He produced [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operettas at the Royal Grammar School, put on concerts at the Parish Church, and started a week-long annual Festival there in 1946.  Bernarr's pupils won awards and scholarships and in 1947 representatives from 30 local choirs joined in Handel's Messiah. Bernarr conducted the High Wycombe String Orchestra and was the soloist in his own Piano Concerto. In 1951 the High Wycombe Parish Church Choir was chosen to sing Evensong in the Festival Church on the new South Bank site.  He turned the Royal Grammar School at High Wycombe into a singing school. Bemarr realised that the quality of music teaching in schools was paramount. This meant focussing on the teachers themselves. So in 1952 he became Director of Music at [[College of St Mark &amp; St John|The College of St. Mark and St. John]], Chelsea, the Church of England College for teachers, a remarkable community whose members have stayed friends. Later he became Head of Music at Gypsy Hill College, now Kingston University, and retired in 1978.

His distinguished record was acknowledged when he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1994 and an Honorary Fellow of Trinity College in the following year. He was President of the Campaign for the Defence of the Traditional Cathedral Choir and in 1996 he established the Bernarr Rainbow Award for School Music Teachers.

Bernarr Rainbow died in Esher, Surrey on 17 March 1998 at the age of 83.&lt;ref name ="Independent"/&gt;

The bronze '''''Boxer at Rest''''', also known as the '''''Terme Boxer''''' or '''''Boxer of the Quirinal''''', is a [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] Greek sculpture of a sitting nude [[Ancient Greek boxing|boxer]] at rest, still wearing his [[caestus]], a type of leather hand-wrap.  It has been given various dates within the period of about 330 to 50 BCE.  It was excavated in Rome in 1885, and is now in the collection of the [[National Museum of Rome]], normally displayed in the [[Palazzo Massimo alle Terme]].

The ''Boxer at Rest'' is one of the finest examples of [[bronze sculpture]]s to have survived from the ancient world; survivals from the period are rare, as they were easily melted down and transformed into new objects. The work comes from a period in Greek art where there is a movement away from idealised heroic depictions of the body and youth, and an exploration of emotional themes and greater realism.

==Discovery==
The Boxer is one of two unrelated [[bronze sculpture|bronzes]] (the other being the unidentified Hellenistic ruler) discovered on the slopes of the [[Quirinal Hill|Quirinal]] within a month of each other in 1885, possibly from the remains of the [[Baths of Constantine (Rome)|Baths of Constantine]]. It appears that both had been carefully buried in antiquity.  The archaeologist [[Rodolfo Lanciani]], who was present at the sculpture's discovery, wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have witnessed, in my long career in the active field of archaeology, many discoveries; I have experienced surprise after surprise; I have sometimes and most unexpectedly met with real masterpieces; but I have never felt such an extraordinary impression as the one created by the sight of this magnificent specimen of a semi-barbaric athlete, coming slowly out of the ground, as if awakening from a long repose after his gallant fights.&lt;ref&gt;Lanciani, ''Ancient Rome in Light of Recent Discoveries'' (1888:305–306), quoted in [http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/now-at-the-met/features/2013/the-boxer Sean Hemingway, "The Boxer: an ancient masterpiece comes to the Met", 2013]; accessed 29 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Púgil Massimo 06.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Detail of the head]]
The statue is a masterpiece of Hellenistic athletic professionalism, with a top-heavy over-muscled torso and scarred and bruised face, [[cauliflower ears]], broken nose, and a mouth suggesting broken teeth. [[R.R.R. Smith]] believes that the statue does not show a true portrait: this is genre realism, individuality removed in favour of a generic character of "boxer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=R. R. R.|title=Hellenistic Sculpture|date=1991|location=London|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 both bronzes were meticulously conserved by Nikolaus Himmelmann, in preparation for their exhibition at the [[Akademisches Kunstmuseum]] in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Himmelmann|first1=Nikolaus|title=Herrscher und Athlet: Die Bronzen vom Quirinal|date=1998|publisher=Olivetti|location=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is soldered together from eight segments, separately cast through the [[Lost wax process|lost-wax process]]; the joins have been filed and finished to be virtually invisible. The lips and wounds and scars about the face were originally inlaid with copper, and further copper inlays on the right shoulder, forearm, caestus and thigh represented drops and trickles of blood. The fingers and toes were worn from being rubbed by passers-by in ancient times, which has suggested that the ''Boxer'' was carefully buried to preserve its talismanic value, when the Baths were abandoned after the [[Goths]] cut the aqueducts that fed them.&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue was displayed in the United States for the first time from June to July 2013 at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City as part of the "Year of Italian Culture in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italyinus2013.org/en/art/2013/06/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620020421/http://www.italyinus2013.org/en/art/2013/06/|title=Art - June 2013 - Italy in US 2013: Year of Italian Culture in the United States|archivedate=20 June 2013|work=italyinus2013.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The literary and aesthetic reception of the statue continues to be of high regard for its aesthetic virtues. In 1991 [[Thom Jones]] wrote "The Pugilist at Rest", a short story which includes the aesthetic reflection upon the statue's rare quality as seen through the eyes of a worn and weary boxer contemplating its inspiration. He suggested that the  sitter may be the famed Ancient boxer, [[Theagenes of Thasos|Theogenes]]. During the time of its display in New York during the summer of 2013 (ended 20 July), ''New York'' magazine published on 15 July 2013 a full page dedication to the special qualities and attributes of the statue.

Jerry Saltz, the author of this magazine article enumerated the six distinctive features of the statue as follows: (i) The Pose, distinct for its massiveness and "elemental" form, (ii) The Face, noted for the large brow and columnar neck, (iii) The Blood, noted by its inlaid copper upon the bronze statue itself, (iv) The Scarred Genitals, distinct for being [[Kynodesme|infibulated]] for cultural and aesthetic purposes of ancient times, (v) The Hands, noted for being astounding yet gentle at the same time, and (vi) The Foresight, referring to the sculptor's strength of vision which resembles and conjures [[Goya]]'s ''Giant'' as well as comparison with "[[Diego Velázquez|Velazquez]] and [[Rembrandt]]", as Saltz completes his list.

The Italian poet [[Gabriele Tinti (writer)|Gabriele Tinti]] has written essays and some poems on sculpture and presented a series of readings in front of the statue at the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] with the actor [[Robert Davi]]  and at the [[National Roman Museum]] with the actor [[Franco Nero]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=379fr-ZlMQQ, National Roman Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary}}
A '''brayer''' is a hand-tool used historically in [[printing]] and [[printmaking]] to break up and "rub out" (spread) ink before it was "beaten" using [[Ink ball|inking balls]] or [[composition roller]]s. The word is derived from the verb to "bray", meaning "to break, pound, or grind small, as in a mortar".&lt;ref&gt;''The Chambers dictionary'' (Edinburgh: Chambers, 1993), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; A brayer consists of a short wooden cylinder with a handle fitted to one end; the other, flat end is used to rub the ink.&lt;ref&gt;William Savage, ''Dictionary of the art of printing'' (London: Longman etc., 1841), p. 91,&lt;/ref&gt; In the late nineteenth century the term was applied in the United States to a small hand-roller, "used for spreading ink on the inking table, and for applying it to the distributing plates or rollers connected with presses".&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Ringwalt, ''American encyclopaedia of printing'' (Philadelphia: Menamin &amp; Ringwalt, 1871), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Such small rollers were sold as "brayers" from at least 1912&lt;ref&gt;The American Type Founders specimen of this year lists both hand-rollers (large) and brayers (small).&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the century the term was applied in the U.S. to hand-rollers of all sorts and sizes. It retains its original meaning in Europe.

==Materials==
Brayers in the original sense were generally made of wood (though Southward refers to theirs being made of "wood or glass").&lt;ref&gt;John Southward, ''Practical printing'' (4th edition by Arthur Powell. London: "Printer's Register" Office, 1892), page 370.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, rollers could be made of [[Composition roller|composition]], [[Vulcanization|vulcanized rubber]], [[sponge]], [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]], [[polyurethane]] or [[leather]]. They are formed around a shaft or core and often attached to a wooden handle. Some rollers have an all-metal support, while larger examples may have two handles to allow for two-handed use (to allow the heavy roller to be controlled and in some cases to apply additional pressure).

==Process==
The printer uses an [[Spatula (disambiguation)|ink knife]] to lay out a "pad", mound or streak of ink on a smooth inking plate, originally made of polished metal or stone. The ink is then rubbed with the brayer until an area is smooth enough to beat with the ink balls or roller. In contemporary printmaking commercially available inks are often smooth and soft enough that they do not require braying before they can be rolled (and thus a more-fragile glass sheet may be used as an inking plate). The roller is passed systematically across the surface to produce an even layer of ink. The roller is then applied to the [[Forme (printing)|forme]], [[Relief printing|block]], [[Lithography|stone]] or [[Intaglio (printmaking)|plate]] so that the ink is evenly transferred to the raised or receptive areas before the next stage of transferring the ink, by moderate pressure, to the printing surface or [[Offset printing|offset]] substrate.

==Uses==
Brayers are rarely used in contemporary printing and printmaking to break up and spread ink, except in cases of historical reconstruction or when a printer has made his own ink and it is too thick to spread without the use of a brayer. Rollers are primarily used for [[relief printing]], leather rollers almost exclusively in [[lithography]] and sponge rollers are used only for [[paint]], [[scrapbooking]] and other craft applications.

'''Bruno Zevi''' (22 January 1918 – 9 January 2000) was an Italian architect, historian, professor, curator, author, and editor. Zevi was a vocal critic of "classicizing" modern architecture and [[postmodernism]].

==Early life==
Zevi was born and died in Rome. His family was [[Italian Jew]]ish.&lt;ref&gt;His kin never kept him from openly expressing his own ideas: Art Kutcher (''Politics could do more harm than the planners in Jerusalem'', [[The Times]] , Monday, Aug 25, 1975; pg. 6; Issue 59483) remembers a protest in 1970 against [[Teddy Kollek]], opposing the project of building an underground parking near the [[Jaffa Gate]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On finishing school in 1933, he enrolled at the Faculty of Architecture at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]]. Due to the [[anti-Semitic]] laws, Zevi was forced in 1938 to abandon his studies, and so left for London, UK, before moving to the United States. Zevi graduated from the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], then under the directorship of [[Walter Gropius]].

In 1940 he married Italian journalist and writer [[Tullia Zevi|Tullia Calabi]].&lt;ref name="NY Times - 27Jan2011 - obits - Tullia Zevi"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/world/europe/27zevi.html|title=Tullia Zevi, 91; Led Italian Jewish Community|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|date=27 January 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=23|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While in the US he discovered the work of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], which became one of the bases for his championing of [[organic architecture]].&lt;ref name="Zeier, 2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pilat|first1=Stephanie Zeier|title=Reconstructing Italy: The Ina-Casa Neighborhoods of the Postwar Era|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781409465805|page=63|edition=US|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPzsCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=Association+for+Organic+Architecture+(APAO)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LhYxDzni2S&amp;sig=R1U7zR0ywjU3uX4_14SO3yof-XY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ6KyNuYvUAhUD7iYKHd_bBQsQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Association%20for%20Organic%20Architecture%20(APAO)&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zevi returned to London in 1943, working as a translator in the war effort.

==Association for Organic Architecture==
In 1944, he founded the influential Association for Organic Architecture (APAO).&lt;ref name="Zeier, 2014" /&gt; The following year the magazine ''Metron-architecture'' reviewed his book [https://www.amazon.com/Towards-Organic-Architecture-Bruno-Zevi/dp/B000WEKQ3A Towards an Organic Architecture]  (published in English by [[Faber and Faber|Faber]] in 1950), which brought him international acclaim.

[[Image:IMG 0387 - scalea Bruno Zevi.jpg|thumb|300px|A stairway in Rome named in his honor]]

==University professor==
In 1945, Zevi became Professor of Architectural History at the [[University of Venice]]. Later, he was a Professor at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]], and a member of the [[International Academy of Architecture]] (IAA) in Sofia, Bulgaria.

==Editor, writer and politician==
From 1955 onwards, he wrote a column for the weekly ''[[L'Espresso]]'' magazine. He was an active member of the Italian Jewish community, and took part in anti-fascist activities within the [[Giustizia e Libertà]] movement. He was active in the [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] and later in [[Popular Unity (Italy)|Popular Unity]] and in the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]], which he represented in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] from 1987 to 1992. From 1954 until his death in 2000 he was editor of his own magazine ''[[L'architettura. Cronache e storia]]''.

''The Modern Language of Architecture'' is one of Zevi’s most significant publications. In this book Zevi sets forth seven principles or “antirules” to codify the language of architecture created by [[Le Corbusier]], [[Walter Gropius|Gropius]], [[Mies van der Rohe]], and [[Frank Lloyd Wright|Wright]]. In place of the classical language of the Beaux Art school, with its focus on abstract principles of order, proportion, and symmetry, he presents an alternative system of communication characterized by a free interpretation of contents and function, an emphasis on difference and dissonance, a dynamic of multidimensional vision, and independent interplay of elements, an organic marriage of engineering and design, a concept of living spaces that are designed for use, and an integration of buildings into their surroundings. Anticipating the innovations of postmodern architecture, Zevi argues forcefully for complexity and against unity, for decomposition dialogue between architecture and historiography, finding elements of the modern language of architecture throughout history, and discussing the process of architectural innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zevi|first1=Bruno|title=The modern language of architecture|date=1978|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|isbn=9780295955681|url=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=13470360009&amp;searchurl=isbn%3D9780295955681%26sortby%3D17|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture as space==
Zevi argued in ''Saper Vedere L'Architettura'' (1948, translated as ''Architecture as Space. How to Look at Architecture'') that space is essential for both the definition and appreciation of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Sauchelli, [http://philpapers.org/rec/SAUOAA 'On Architecture as a Spatial Art'], ''[http://nsae.au.dk/the-journal Nordic Journal of Aesthetics]'', 43 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern architecture movement==
Zevi participated in the influential International Architecture Symposium "Mensch und Raum" (Man and Space) at the [[Vienna University of Technology]] (Technische Universität Wien) in 1984, also attended by [[Justus Dahinden]], Ernst Gisel, [[Jorge Glusberg]], Otto Kapfinger, [[Frei Otto]], [[Ionel Schein]], [[Dennis Sharp]], [[Paolo Soleri]], and [[Pierre Vago]].

Such was Zevi's uncompromising critique of any tendency in modern architecture towards classicism that he even would criticize those architects he otherwise admired: "When [[Walter Gropius|Gropius]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies]]  and [[Alvar Aalto|Aalto]] produced [symmetrical buildings] it was an act of surrender. Lacking a modern code, they weakened and regressed to the familiar womb of classicism." (Zevi, ''The Modern Language of Architecture'').

== Quotes ==
"In 1973, Zevi set out (his) ideas as a set of invariants - a sort of anti-classical codebook that attempted to define modernity as a language of asymmetry and dissonance, which he propagated via his magazine L'architettura, cronache e storia. This exciting theory of architecture as rupture and fragmentation marks him out as the seminal theoretician for all currents of modernism interested in iconoclasm and deconstruction, from [[Alvar Aalto]] in the 1930s to [[Daniel Libeskind]] in the 1990s." (Thomas Muirhead, March 1, 2000; ''The Guardian'', Obituary, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Muirhead, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/mar/01/guardianobituaries1 'Bruno Zevi, Architectural philosopher who railed against the evils of classicism'], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Wednesday 1 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cave of the Ramban''' is located in the southern cliff of the Upper [[Kidron Valley]], on a slope descending into the Arab neighborhood of [[Wadi al-Joz]], [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="KlonerYiśraʼel2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amos Kloner|author2=Agudah le-seḳer arkheʼologi shel Yiśraʼel|title=Survey of Jerusalem: the northeastern sector|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CuMuAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=3 November 2010|year=2001|publisher=Rashut ha-ʻatiḳot, ha-Agudah le-seḳer arkheʼologi shel Yiśraʼel|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by some to be the traditional burial place of [[Nahmanides]] (also known as Ramban), a foremost rabbinical scholar during the medieval era.

==Burial chamber==
The large [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-hewn cave]], measuring 19 by 20 m, reaches a height of 3.5 meters and is supported by two columns. The area once functioned as an ancient underground [[Jerusalem stone|stone]] quarry. Above the façade, in the upper portion of the cliff, are the remains of a square rock-cut chamber which may have been used for burials.&lt;ref name="KlonerZissu2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amos Kloner|author2=Boaz Zissu|title=The Necropolis of Jerusalem in the Second Temple period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zeQuAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=3 November 2010|year=2007|publisher=Peeters|isbn=978-90-429-1792-7|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The cave is believed by some Jews to be the site where Ramban prayed in the 13th-century and the place of his interment. It is thus claimed to have been a holy site for Jews for many centuries.&lt;ref name="Guinn2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=David E. Guinn|title=Protecting Jerusalem's holy sites: a strategy for negotiating a sacred peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9TX_Cs1ndgC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=3 November 2010|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86662-0|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vilnay2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zev Vilnay|title=Legends of Palestine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkA6-0-aDdIC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=6 November 2010|date=10 March 2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-4128-5|pages=100–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the cave became a subject of controversy between a group of Jewish inhabitants in Wadi al-Joz and the Muslim owner of the site, who had fenced off the cave in protest to Jewish settlement in the area.&lt;ref name="Guinn2006"/&gt; The National Authority for Holy Sites convinced the [[Ministry of Religious Services|Ministry of Religious Affairs]] of its religious significance and the cave was declared a holy site and handed over to the ministry’s control.&lt;ref name=YW&gt;[http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/article.php?p=27465 Court: Ramban’s Cave Belongs to the Muslim Waqf], ''theyeshivaworld.com'', December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim ''[[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|wakf]]'' subsequently petitioned the [[Supreme Court of Israel|High Court of Justice]] which resulted in a temporary injunction freezing the site's designation. In 2003, a government committee was appointed to examine the issue.&lt;ref name="Guinn2006"/&gt; While acknowledging the site's connection to the Jewish faith, it was decided that the court could rule on the matter. This however was thwarted when the holy status was reinstated by a government minister.&lt;ref name=YW/&gt; The ''wakf'' persisted in its battle for control of the site in the courts and in 2008 it was decided that the cave be placed under the ''wakfs'' authority and Jews were banned from entering.&lt;ref name=YW/&gt;

Other traditions hold that Ramban was buried in [[Silwan]], in [[Hebron]] or in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].&lt;ref name="MaʻozNusseibeh2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moshe Maʻoz|author2=Sari Nusseibeh|title=Jerusalem: points of friction, and beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9evpVS_ackwC&amp;pg=PA118|accessdate=3 November 2010|year=2000|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-411-8843-4|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Choose the right'''" is a saying or [[motto]] among members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) that is taught to children and used by members of the church as a reminder to make choices that will help an individual to live [[righteousness|righteously]]. The phrase is taken from an [[Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)|LDS hymn]] Choose the Right.

The letters CTR, a reference to this phrase, are incorporated into a shield logo designed by Helen Alldredge,&lt;ref name="SLT 2006-10-06"&gt;{{citation |last= Ravitz |first= Jessica |date= October 6, 2006 |title= Designer of 'CTR' radiated love for all |url= http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=4449583&amp;itype=NGPSID |newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Margery Cannon and Lurene Wilkinson &lt;ref&gt;http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=4596390&amp;itype=NGPSID&lt;/ref&gt; who were Primary General Board members in the 1960s. In 1970, a church committee headed by [[Naomi W. Randall]] recommended that the shield be incorporated into official church material. Since then, both the phrase and symbol have been used in religious educational materials for LDS youth of [[Primary (LDS Church)|Primary]] age.&lt;ref name=BYU_Mag_W_1998&gt;{{citation |url= http://magazine.byu.edu/?act=view&amp;a=625 |title= 'I Am a Child of God' Lyricist Honored |journal= [[BYU Magazine]] |date=Winter 1998 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol is also used in [[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS culture]] by members of all ages, both as a reminder of the motto, as well as an indicator of religious affiliation. The CTR initials, displayed on the shield and in other forms, can be seen mainly on CTR rings as well as other types of [[jewelry]], [[tee shirt]]s, [[bookmark]]s and [[stationery]].

[[File:CTR Ring (LDS Church).jpg|right|thumb|A CTR ring, showing the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] design]]
A [[finger ring|ring]] with the letters "CTR" on is often worn by members of the LDS Church as a reminder of the "Choose the Right" motto, and as a symbol of their religious affiliation.

CTR rings were introduced at the same time as the CTR shield in 1970 by Primary general president [[LaVern W. Parmley]] after being recommended by a committee chaired by Naomi W. Randall.&lt;ref name=BYU_Mag_W_1998 /&gt; In connection with the children's [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] program, each LDS child in this age group is given an adjustable ring with a green [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] bearing the letters "CTR" in silver.

Over the years CTR rings have become popular with both children and adults in the LDS Church. They are now available in a variety of designs in over 30 languages.

CTR Rings can be purchased from a number of jewelers, or directly from the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= CTR Ring |url= http://store.lds.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product3_715839595_10557_21136_-1__195519 |work= Store.LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Christian music industry''' is a small part of the larger [[music industry]], that focuses on traditional [[Gospel music]], [[Southern gospel]], [[contemporary Christian music]], and [[alternative Christian music]]. It is sometimes called the '''gospel music industry''', although this designation is not a limitation on the musical styles represented.

Christian artists generally use secular styles, pairing them with lyrics that display faith and spirituality to varying degrees. Generally speaking, the industry is influenced by mainstream culture. Musical trends, for instance, follow those of the secular scene, though usually a few years behind.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_dct"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="dc Talk" p. 239.}} '''Quote:''' "Of ''course'' the Christian market was a few years behind the rest of the world... it always is." [original emphasis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCM_20_1_CS"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Urbanski |first=David |date=July 1997 |title=One Crazy Summer |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=24–32 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RPCinA"/&gt; The Christian music industry carries the distinction of being the only music subculture whose content is labeled by its lyrical dimension rather than its music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Still, music within the industry is sold by its musical style rather than lyrical content.

Christian music's critics point to the divergent interests of commercialization and ministry, which have, according to some, [[wikt:polar opposite|polar opposite]] goals. Aspects of Christian music have long struggled to gain general acceptance, even within the Christian community. What some see as secularization and a lacking of direct theology, others see as artistic ministry. This opens up questions of the definition of "Christian music" that have lingered over the industry since its inception.

The Christian music industry experienced tremendous growth in the 1990s. Christian music sales grew to exceed those for classical, jazz, and new age music.&lt;ref name="GMA_OV_08"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmta.com/GMA_Industry_Overview_2008.pdf |title=GMA Industry Overview 2008 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Christian Music Trade Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the Christian music industry has experienced the same issues as the general market in recent years.

==History==
The contemporary Christian music industry has roots in the late 1960s and early 1970s [[Jesus movement]] and its [[Jesus music]] artists. The ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music'' points out three reasons that the Christian music industry developed as a parallel structure to the general music industry.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="Introduction" pp. 9–13.}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the Jesus movement produced a large number of bands in a very short period, which the general market was unable and/or unwilling to absorb.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"/&gt; This was in part due to a lack of appreciation for the ideology expressed by such artists.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"/&gt; Finally, Jesus music artists tended toward mistrust of secular corporations.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_intro"/&gt; According to another critic, the industry in this period was defined by four characteristics: lack of audience acceptance for styles, inferior production, inefficient distribution, and lack of wide radio exposure.&lt;ref name="RPCinA"/&gt; [[Petra (band)|Petra]], for instance, struggled to find an audience for their hard rock sound, partially due to limited distribution to Christian bookstores.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"&gt;{{harvnb|Cusic|2002|loc=Part Four, pp. 279–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even so, the 1970s saw established corporations become involved in the Christian music market. [[Word Records]], founded in 1951, was bought in 1976 by [[ABC Records|ABC]].&lt;ref name="Mount_Web"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mount |first=Daniel J. |title=A City on a Hilltop? The History of Contemporary Christian Music |year=2005 |url=http://www.danielmount.net/ccm.html |accessdate=2007-02-12 |page=50 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203163712/http://www.danielmount.net/ccm.html |archivedate=February 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other music industry giants also got involved, [[Columbia Records|CBS]] started a short-lived Christian label, Priority Records, and [[MCA Records|MCA]] also fielded a label, Songbird Records, for a time.

While the Jesus movement had ended by the 1980s, the Christian music industry was maturing and transforming into a multimillion-dollar enterprise. The early 1980s saw an increase Christian booksellers taking product, and an increase in sales followed, despite [[Domestic policy of the Reagan administration#"Reaganomics" and the economy|the recession]].&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; As a percentage of gross sales, Christian music rose from 9% in 1976 to 23% in 1985.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; By [[Age to Age|her 1982 release]] [[Amy Grant]] had saturated the Christian marketplace and made significant inroads into the general market.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; [[Sandi Patti]] and [[Michael W. Smith]] also gained influence within Christian music, each playing significant roles in the development of the industry.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt;

Harder forms of Christian music, such as [[metal music|heavy metal]], also began to gain acceptance. This is largely credited to [[Stryper]], who had begun making inroads into the general market by 1985.&lt;ref name="Hale_93"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hale |first=Mark |title=Headbangers |year=1993 |publisher=Popular Culture, Ink. |location=[[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] |edition=First edition, second printing |isbn=1-56075-029-4 |chapter=2869 |page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, rock and [[Christian alternative rock|alternative]] acts faced a longer battle for acceptance than [[Contemporary Christian music|contemporary]] acts, as the form was opposed by prominent religious leaders such as [[Jimmy Swaggart]] and others on the [[Christian right]].&lt;ref name="CCM_28_5"&gt;{{cite journal |date=June 1985 |title=Christian Rock Wars: Evangelist [[Jimmy Swaggart]] Tells Why He Hates Today's Christian Rock |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=14–17 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DTT_CROCK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.av1611.org/articles.html#Crock |title=Articles / Christian Music |publisher=[[Dial-the-Truth Ministries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in 1981 total gospel music industry revenues were approximately $180&amp;nbsp;million, only ten years later they would total $680&amp;nbsp;million, according to ''CCM Magazine''.&lt;ref name="CCM_14_6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gascon |first=Ana |date=December 1991 |title=A Music Video Network That Needs To Be Zeen |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=14 |issue=6 |page=12 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to RIAA data, market share for sales of Christian music albums more than doubled between 1993 and 1997.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970317"/&gt; In the 1990s the Christian music industry became the fastest growing segment of the music industry.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970317"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gillespie |first=Natalie Nichols |title=Gospel Is Fastest-Growing Genre |journal=CCM Update |date=March 17, 1997|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to several factors, including consolidation of record labels, and independent Christian bookstores into chains.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt;

The Christian music industry began adopting SoundScan in 1995, although implementation was spotty even into the millennium. Even so, the adoption caused the visibility of Christian artists to increase significantly, and brought credibility to the industry as Christian albums became integrated into all [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]].&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CCMU_19990712"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brasher |first=Joan |title=Christian Music's Mid-Year Sales Jump 21 Percent |journal=CCM Update |date=July 12, 1999|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCMU_1995_Review"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akins |first=Debra |title=The Year in Review: 1995 Broke New Ground for Christian Music |journal=CCM Update |year=1995|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, 90% of Christian music sales originated at Christian bookstores. By 1995, that number had dropped to 64%, with general retailers taking 21%, and the remainder accountable through other methods, such as direct mail.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; At that same time, the industry was estimated to gross $750&amp;nbsp;million, with $381&amp;nbsp;million in album sales.&lt;ref name="Econ_1995-08-19"&gt;{{cite journal|title=God's Own Country|publisher=The Economist|volume=336|issue=7928|date=August 19, 1995|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, general market retailers, especially big box stores such as [[Best Buy]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], and [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]] began carrying a wider selection of Christian music products.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19980126"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren |first=Lindy |title=CMTA Launches Dove Retail, Radio Campaign, Wal-Mart to expand Christian music sections |journal=CCM Update |date=January 26, 1998|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000 those stores had surpassed Christian retail in terms of the number of Christian albums sold, according to [[Soundscan]] numbers.&lt;ref name="CCMU_20020107"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Connor |first=Lizza |title=Christian Music Sales Set Record for 2001: Gap between general-market and Christian retailers widest in SoundScan history |journal=CCM Update |date=January 7, 2002|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCMU_20011119"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren |first=Lindy |title=General-market Competition Focus for CBA Expo 2002 |journal=CCM Update |date=November 19, 2001|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon was partially responsible for crossover successes. [[P.O.D.]], for example, sold 1.4&amp;nbsp;million albums in 2001, although sales at Christian retail outlets accounted for only 10%.&lt;ref name="CCMU_20020107"/&gt;

The new millennium has brought [[2000s in music industry|challenges for the record industry]] as a whole, and these have affected the Christian music industry as well.&lt;ref name="CYTY_09_Recession"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Geil |first=Mark |title=Music in Recession |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |date=June 2, 2009|issn=0009-5753 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/commentaries/2009/musicinrecession.html |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Contemporary worship music]], a long time staple of the industry, began to gain significant [[market share]] in about the year 2000.&lt;ref name="CR_46_8"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feinberg |first=Margaret |authorlink=Margaret Feinberg |title=Modern Worship Is Exploding |journal=Christian Retailing |date=April 15, 2000 |pages=45–56 |volume=46 |issue=8 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBAJ_32_7"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCabe |first=Ginny |title=Praise &amp; Worship Music Changing for the Millennium |journal=CBA Marketplace |date=July 1999 |volume=32 |issue=7 |page=222 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; By focusing on marketing worship music to youth culture, this genre became a growth driver despite the downturn in the general music industry.&lt;ref name="BB_111_18"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=May 1, 1999 |title=Worship Music Targets Youth |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |issn=0006-2510 |volume=111 |issue=18 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BB_118_13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB_115_07"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Deborah Evans |date=February 15, 2003 |title=Praise and Worship Genre Blessed With Global Growth |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |issn=0006-2510 |volume=115 |issue=7 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCMU_20000529"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Riddle |first=Melissa |title=Modern Worship Music Booms: Labels scramble to meet demand |journal=CCM Update |date=May 29, 2000|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|quote="The money is just drying up.&lt;br /&gt;And it's not being replaced."|source=John W. Styll, president, [[Gospel Music Association]] and longtime ''[[CCM Magazine|CCM]]'' publisher&lt;ref name="CYTY_09_Recession"/&gt;|width=25%}}

Growth continued until about 2003,&lt;ref name="BB_118_13"&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 1, 2006 |title=Gospel and Christian |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |issn=0006-2510 |volume=118 |issue=13 |pages=35–37 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has generally followed the trends of the larger music industry since that point. In 2009 a [[The New York Times]] [[op-ed]] placed the entire music industry on a "deathwatch,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles M. |last=Blow |authorlink=Charles M. Blow |title=Swan Songs? |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2009-09-23 |page=A17 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/01/opinion/01blow.html |date=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that new forms of media, piracy, and new pricing options are driving gross sales down. In another example of parallelism, the Christian music industry has experienced largely the same phenomenon. In the Christian marketplace, music consumption has risen by as much as 30% since 2005, but overall album sales have dropped to about half of their 1999 levels.&lt;ref name="CYTY_09_Recession"/&gt; However, some critics point out that the current downturn may have long term positive effects for the industry. [[John J. Thompson]] told ''[[Christianity Today]]'' that "The lack of monetary benefit has filtered out some of the people who should not have been doing this in the first place. If the people who are in it for the money are gone, it leaves more turf for those who had something a little bit loftier in mind."&lt;ref name="CYTY_09_Recession"/&gt;

==Criticisms==&lt;!-- Obviously, there are a great number of bands that could be listed in this section. Please try to limit these to relevant examples. --&gt;

==="Ghetto" assertion===
Christian music is sometimes cited as a "ghetto,"&lt;ref name="RPCinA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AoR1999"/&gt; meaning that the majority of artists in the industry are pigeonholed to operate solely in it. These artists are isolated from the mainstream public, to [[Christian media]], including radio, magazines, and book stores. For many this is a conscious choice, however others, not content to stay in an isolated industry segment, attempt to "cross over" and gain acceptance in the general market. For many artists, being called Christian becomes a [[wiktionary:stigma|stigma]].&lt;ref name="Hendershot2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendershot|2004|loc=pp. 39–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|caption=A 1997 survey looked at familiarity with "well-known" Christian artists. Self-identified Christian music listeners in are shown in green, and the general public in red.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970526_s"/&gt;
}}

A 1997 study revealed that a self-identified audience of "Christian music listeners" had what was considered a lacking recognition of Christian artists.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970526_s"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Consumer Survey Reveals Potential Markets for Christian Music |journal=CCM Update |date=May 26, 1997|oclc=22937802 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey was commissioned by the [[Christian Music Trade Association]] and [[Z Music Television]]. The study looked at several artists including [[Amy Grant]], [[BeBe Winans|BeBe]] and [[CeCe Winans]], [[Carman (singer)|Carman]], [[Steven Curtis Chapman]], [[dc Talk]], [[Sandi Patty]], and [[Michael W. Smith]]. At the time of the survey, each of these artists was active in Christian music and had been so for at least nine years, was a multiple [[Dove Award]] and/or [[Grammy Award]] winner, and had albums [[RIAA certification|certified]] Gold or higher.

Even so, the survey found that the Christian music audience was no more familiar with artists in the field than they were with [[Hootie &amp; The Blowfish]], a popular act at that time. The study concluded that the word "Christian" was the problem, causing a stigma. "It's the label, not the music, that dissuades," one Christian music executive was quoted as saying, agreeing with the survey.&lt;ref name="CCMU_19970526_s"/&gt;

Another aspect of the "ghetto" is that some artists have trouble gaining audience with Christians due to their non-conservative image.&lt;ref name="Kyle_2006"&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2006|loc="If You Can't Beat 'em Join 'em" pp. 281–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stryper]] is a well-known example. Stryper received large amounts of criticism from groups on the Christian right, who argue (among other things) that their image as rock stars contradict their espoused faith. One critic wrote that the marriage of secular and religious elements in "Christian music" "violates all that God has commanded in the Bible about [[Doctrine of separation|separation]]."&lt;ref name="Truth85"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pyle |first=Hugh |title=The Truth About Rock Music |publisher=Sword of the Lord Publishers |location=[[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]] |year=1985 |isbn=0-87398-839-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ghetto" has several effects, critics point out that the audience of such artists are often already Christians, thus limiting the impact of any supposed "evangelism."&lt;ref name="JoAC_15_3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1992.t01-1-00079.x |last=Romanowski |first=William D. |title=Roll Over Beethoven, Tell Martin Luther The News: American Evangelicals and Rock Music |pages=79–82 |journal=Journal of American Culture |volume=15 |issue=3 |date=Fall 1992 |publisher=[[Bowling Green State University]] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that artists sometimes have trouble appealing to and maintaining both secular and religious audiences. For example:

*One [[Jesus music]] artist, [[Randy Matthews]], ran into trouble at an early Christian music festival after announcing an upcoming tour with [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] and [[ZZ Top]].&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_RM"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="Randy Matthews" pp. 566–569.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd, also reacting to his electric musical style, chased him off the stage, pronouncing him to be [[Demonic possession|demon]] or [[Drug abuse|drug]] possessed.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_RM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CCM_3_6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rabey |first=Steve |date=December 1980 |title=Randy Matthews... The Long Road To Now |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=3 |issue=6 |page=14 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews was later dropped from the tour.
*After [[Bob Dylan]] announced his conversion to Christianity in 1979, he released three albums widely cited as being based on his newfound faith.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_bdylan"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="Bob Dylan" pp. 277 – 286.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan spent several years touring and preaching from stage, though he never became a part of the "Christian music subculture."&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_bdylan"/&gt; The result, as one critic bluntly puts it, was that "It didn't work. Christian music fans were characteristically suspicious of Dylan's failure to leave the world behind and become a part of their little ghetto, and the world at large tired quickly of paying money to hear him sing about religion."&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_bdylan"/&gt; By 1981, Dylan had dropped the explicit religious references; both critics and audiences returned his music to acclaim.
*While commonly cited as the father of Christian rock, [[Larry Norman]] struggled to gain acceptance from the Christian music industry, and was largely estranged from it for his career.&lt;ref name="Powell_Fe_LNorman"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2002|loc="Larry Norman" pp. 633–641.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CYTY_52_4"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Christian Rock's 'Father' Dies: icon Larry Norman was often estranged from the industry |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |date=April 2008 |volume=52 |issue=4 |page=13 |issn=0009-5753 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Upon This Rock (Larry Norman album)|1969 solo debut]] has been described by secular observers as "perhaps the first truly accomplished and relevant Christian rock testimony ever recorded,"&lt;ref name="AllMusic_LN_1969"&gt;{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r90988|pure_url=yes}} | publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=2009-04-26 |first=Vincent | last=Jeffries | title=''Upon This Rock''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1972's ''[[Only Visiting This Planet]]'' became one of the most revered albums of all time in Christian music. Even so, Norman became, according to ''CCM'' "so far outside the mainstream that most of today's Christian music fans have no idea who Larry Norman is."&lt;ref name="CCM_30_9_LN"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=John J. |authorlink=John J. Thompson |date=April 2008 |title=Remembering Larry Norman |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=24 |issue=9 |page=42 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem, as summed by one critic, was that the music was too religious for secular audience, while simultaneously too aggressive for religious audiences.&lt;ref name="JMIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AoR1999"/&gt; One critic describes the situation, stating that for a band "to be taken seriously outside the Christian scene, a band must stay far, far away from that scene."&lt;ref name="CTTY_06_06"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moll |first=Rob |title=Rock Un-Solid: When Christian bands bite the hands that praised them |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/june/28.62.html |date=June 2006 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mutemath]], for instance sued their record label with the goal of removing their product from the Christian market. [[Reset (Mute Math EP)|Their first release]] sold almost 30,000 copies, with "bulk of sales coming from the Christian market," according to ''Billboard''.&lt;ref name="BB_118_10"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martens |first=Todd |title=A question of faith: buzz band Mutemath, preferring secular rock, sues Warner |journal=[[Billboard Magazine]] |date=March 11, 2006 |volume=118 |issue=11 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band had been placed in the Christian market by their record label largely because their lead singer, [[Paul Meany]], was previously with the band [[Earthsuit]], whose [[Kaleidoscope Superior|only major label release]] was released on [[Sparrow Records|a Christian label]].

This caused the band to not get taken seriously by music critics, and by the release of [[Mutemath (album)|their full-length album]] the band began expressing discontent with their situation.&lt;ref name="TW_Mutemath"&gt;{{cite news |last=Holub |first=Annie |url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/church-and-state/Content?oid=1083036 |title=Church and State: Mutemath fights the machine at Warner Bros |work=[[Tucson Weekly]] |date=January 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meany told ''Tucson Weekly'' "...we began to see ourselves getting pigeonholed into this particular world that we weren't necessarily proud to be associated with... We're not trying to preach through our music; we don't have some kind of [[evangelistic]] agenda with what we're doing... You know, you don't want to be ashamed of your faith and your beliefs, but you don't want to be marketed by that, either."&lt;ref name="TW_Mutemath"/&gt;

On the other hand, some artists operate solely within the "ghetto" of Christian music, and find great success in doing so.

===Downplayed religious content===&lt;!-- Obviously, there are a great number of bands that could be listed in this section. Please try to limit these to relevant examples. --&gt;
An early Christian record label, [[Lamb &amp; Lion Records]] (founded by [[Pat Boone]]) reported in 1978 that it was their goal to produce crossover artists, but they were limited by lack of distribution to the secular marketplace.&lt;ref name="ET_29_5"&gt;{{cite journal |title=H-E-R-E-S'S Christian Show Biz! |last=Hortegas |first=Steve |journal=Eternity |volume=29 |issue=5 |date=May 1978 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both problems affected Christian labels into the 1990s.&lt;ref name="JoAC_15_3"/&gt; "Since people don't understand [the term] '[[Blood of Christ|the Blood of Jesus]], '" stated a manager for Lamb &amp; Lion, "...music that communicates must approach it another way. We've got to present a subtle but sensitive Christian message."&lt;ref name="ET_29_5"/&gt; Lyrics with subdued religious content have become commonplace in the industry; One critic points out that the secular hit "[[Spirit in the Sky]]" "has more explicit religious references than do many recent Christian radio hits."&lt;ref name="BILLBOARD_G_HIST"&gt;{{Harvnb|Alfonso|2002|loc="Contemporary Christian music: A History" pp. 11–29.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have alleged that CCM often uses "minimal direct theology," and promotes a "Jesus is my boyfriend" image of God.&lt;ref name="Cusic_PART4"/&gt; Using downplayed religious content in lyrics has allowed some artists to "cross over" and make significant impact into the general market. Some Christian bands are able to do this while maintaining their identity in the Christian market. For example, [[MercyMe]], whose double platinum album ''[[Almost There (MercyMe album)|Almost There]]'' produced the Christian and secular chart hit "[[I Can Only Imagine (MercyMe song)|I Can Only Imagine]]." However, the lyrics of the single, while Christian in nature, contain what one critic calls "rather [[wiktionary:vacuous|vacuous]] theology."&lt;ref name="JMIA"/&gt;

Sometimes "crossing over" creates ambiguity over whether an artist is Christian (a "Christian band"),&lt;ref name="AoR1999"/&gt; or the artist is composed of Christians and produces music that appeals to Christian music fans but doesn't cater to the Christian market ("Christians in a band").&lt;ref name="AoR1999"/&gt; Such artists are:

*[[Chevelle (band)|Chevelle]], whose [[Point No. 1|debut album]] was released to Christian music markets, received three [[Dove award]]s.&lt;ref name="DOVE_CHV1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?cid=32 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020106001828/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?cid=32 |archivedate=January 6, 2002 |title=Dove Award Recipients for Hard Music Recorded Song |publisher=[[Gospel Music Association]] |accessdate=2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DOVE_CHV2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020406020434/http://doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=2000 |archivedate=April 6, 2002 |title=Dove Award Recipients for Hard Music Album |publisher=Gospel Music Association |accessdate=2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the band is not generally considered to be a "Christian band" today. On that topic the band states "We originally signed with [[Squint Entertainment|a record company]] that was backed by [[Word Records|Word]] (a Christian label housing [[John Tesh]] and [[Amy Grant]]), so the record was in Christian bookstores. It was really an accidental thing."
*[[Project 86]] has sometimes been labeled a "Christian band", although the band itself eschewed the label. The band considers its art to be the best conveyance of their message.&lt;ref name="CM_Vol_52"&gt;{{cite book |last=Winters |first=Kelly |editor=Pilchak, Angela M. |title=Contemporary Musicians |series=Volume 52 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Gale Group]] |location=[[Farmington Hills, Michigan]] |issn=1044-2197 |isbn=0-7876-8065-6 |chapter=Project 86 |pages=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frontman Andrew Schwab has offered several statements on the topic. "We're not going to go in there and say 'Hey we're the Christian band. We're going to carry ourselves like a normal band. Hopefully people will like our music and investigate into the band [...] and they will learn our beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Wide range of music inspires Project 86 | author = Gonzales, Ron | publisher = [[Albuquerque Journal]] | page = 2D | date = May 28, 2004 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If we're playing at [[Ozzfest]] or on [[Family Values Tour|Family Values]]...," the band told ''[[7ball]]'' after the release of [[Drawing Black Lines|their second album]], "there is a greater level of tact necessary in order to reach that sort of audience."&lt;ref name="7b_30"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dodd |first=Jason |title=Hard and Fast |pages=51–52 |date=May–June 2000 |issue=30 |journal=[[7ball]] |issn=1082-3980 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 interview, Schwab further opined "We always tell people that the goal has been to just write music that we love, and write music hopefully that is challenging and inspiring to people and doesn't sound like everything else out there."&lt;ref name = "DIBASE_2007-04-23"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/interviews/Project862007.asp | title = I want ''Rival Factions'' | last = DiBase | first = John | publisher = Jesus Freak Hideout | date = April 23, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Switchfoot]] is often referred to as a "Christian band", mostly due to their involvement with the Christian rock scene in their early days. But the band has always shunned this label: "For us, it's a faith, not a genre,..." says Jon Foreman. "...these songs are for everyone. Calling us 'Christian rock' tends to be a box that closes some people out and excludes them. And that's not what we're trying to do. Music has always opened my mind—and that's what we want".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/01/09/switchfoot_steps_toward_stardom |title=Switchfoot steps toward stardom |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=January 9, 2004 |accessdate=2006-08-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050123135046/http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/01/09/switchfoot_steps_toward_stardom?mode=PF |archivedate = January 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duly, Foreman's lyrics steer clear of preachiness, exclusive declarations of faith, or even any mention of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], instead [[Social commentary|questioning the status quo]], probing [[Existentialism|existential]] issues through "[[Socratic dialogue]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utahstatesman.com/media/storage/paper243/news/2004/10/13/Features/Question.And.Answer.With.Switchfoots.Jon.Foreman-751862.shtml |title=Question and Answer with Switchfoot's Jon Foreman |date=October 13, 2004 |accessdate=2006-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130208220210/http://www.utahstatesman.com/media/storage/paper243/news/2004/10/13/Features/Question.And.Answer.With.Switchfoots.Jon.Foreman-751862.shtml |archivedate=February 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he answers questions with more questions, exploring frustrations, or simply being inspirational. Even so, this position has not alienated their Christian fans. As in their [[Indie (music)|indie]] days, they are still distributed to Christian retail outlets through [[Sparrow Records]], featured on Christian radio and charts, and presented [[GMA Music Awards|Dove Awards]], even after having been signed to the mainstream [[Columbia Records]]. [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] writer Andrew Beaujon takes the view that "their lyrics often have two different meanings, one meaning for a Christian audience and one meaning for the rest of us. They try to relate to two different groups of people at once".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=444350 |title=Rocking for Jesus |date=June 30, 2006 |accessdate=2006-08-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060706140202/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=444350 |archivedate = July 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In video====
The trend continues when examining religious videos. Many Christian bands produce videos with rotation on [[MTV]] in mind, however, the images can lead to an ambiguous impression of the portrayal.

In 1982 MTV featured two videos, "Constantly Changing" and "It's Mad" (which was the first one to be featured), made by the Swedish Christian rock band [[Jerusalem (Swedish band)|Jerusalem]] to promote their 1981 release ''Warrior''.&lt;ref name="MuLe_2_9"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Cable Music First? Lamb &amp; Lion act to be seen and heard on MTV. |pages=43 |journal=Billboard |date=November 20, 1982 |volume=88 |issue=? |publisher=[[Billboard Magazine]] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DeGarmo and Key]] was the first Christian band in the US whose video appeared on MTV, made a video for their single "Six, Six, Six" off their 1984 release ''Communication''. While the video was shown on MTV for a short time, it was subsequently pulled for a scene which depicted the [[Antichrist]] engulfed in flames, which MTV described as "senseless violence."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |title=MTV Rejects DeGarmo and Key Video, Cites 'Violent' Scene |pages=3, 15 |journal=MusicLine |date=February 1985 |volume=2 |issue=9 |issn=0746-7656 |publisher=[[CCM Communications]] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the video was re-edited for MTV—however, the unedited version continued to play in Christian bookstores and on Christian television networks, like [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|Trinity Broadcasting]].&lt;ref name="MuLe_3_1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=DeGarmo and Key Video Airs on MTV |page=3 |journal=MusicLine |date=May 1985 |volume=3 |issue=1 |issn=0746-7656 |publisher=[[CCM Communications]] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video received a [[Dove award]] in a category created specially for it, "Gospel Music Visual Song" in 1985.&lt;ref name="MuLe_3_1"/&gt;

Another artist, [[Brian Welch]], whose ''[[Save Me from Myself (album)|solo debut]]'' was released to Christian markets, found their album pulled from some Christian bookstores after the music video for "Flush" was released.&lt;ref name="BrianW"/&gt; The video is an interpretation of the authors personal experience with [[methamphetamine]], before his religious conversion. At the time the album was pulled, Brian Welsh released a statement about the visual content of the video, relating its symbolism to his personal experiences of addiction and redemption. He also issued the following statement: "The video for 'Flush' is about [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]] addiction and the crazy things anyone addicted to meth will do while they're [[Substance intoxication|high]] or to get their fix. Everything the models were doing in the video is what I was wrapped up in while I was addicted to meth... I believe I would be dead right now if I continued using meth, but instead, I chose to [[Salvation#Christianity|surrender my life]] to Christ and die to myself so He could share His resurrection with me... There is a huge message of hope on my CD and I believe those retailers that are pulling the CD from their shelves are robbing someone spiritually by taking it off of the shelves."&lt;ref name="BrianW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-Korn guitarist Brian "Head" Welch defends 'controversial' video|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=105600|date=September 25, 2008|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Z Music Television - Joe Gow Study.svg|150px|right|thumb|Classification of videos on Z Music by content&lt;ref name="PMS_S99"/&gt;]]
A study of visual elements of Christian music videos on [[Z Music Television]], a now defunct MTV-like channel for Christian music, found that almost one third of the channel's videos could be described as "Ambiguously Religious" at best (red area, right).&lt;ref name="PMS_S99"/&gt; The conclusion was that the channel's programming was designed to make its Christian nature "apparent only to those willing to listen for it."&lt;ref name="PMS_S99"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gow |first=Joe |date=Summer 1999 |title=Rockin', Rappin', and Religion: Programming Strategy on Z Music Television |journal=Popular Music and Society |publisher=[[Bowling Green State University]] Popular Press |issn=0300-7766 |volume=23 |issue=2 |page=17 |ref=harv |doi=10.1080/03007769908591730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other arguments===
Some critics describe the Christian music industry as being committed "to the goals and strategies of the commercial marketplace – industrial growth, increased market share, and greater profits."&lt;ref name="RPCinA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|2000|loc="Evangelicals and Popular Music: The Contemporary Christian Music Industry" pp. 105–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s as the largest Christian record labels became subsidiaries of the "mainstream" labels (who are themselves owned by huge [[media conglomerate]]s like [[Viacom]] and [[Time Warner]]).&lt;ref name="AoR1999"&gt;{{Harvnb|Howard|1999|loc=p. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hendershot2002"/&gt; Others see the industry as taking on the roles traditionally reserved for the church. Concerts are the equivalent of religious services, and commodities symbols of faith.&lt;ref name="RPCinA_art"&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|2000|loc="Evangelicals and Popular Music: The Art World of Contemporary Christian Music" pp. 109–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under these conditions "[[evangelism]] becomes rhetoric—justifying the propaganda value of the industry's work – not spiritual reality."&lt;ref name="RPCinA_art"/&gt; One critic comments that "perhaps the 'ghettoization' and parallel institutionalism of CCM manifests itself nowhere more apparently than at numerous [[Christian rock festival]]s."&lt;ref name="JMIA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nichols|2008|loc=Chapter 5: "Jesus on Vinyl" pp. 122 – 146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Color rendering capacity''' is a measure of how well [[color]]s are represented under [[artificial light]]. It is one of several measures of [[color rendering index]],&lt;ref&gt;Commission International de l'Eclairage 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating the extent to which a wide range of colors may be distinguished under a given [[light source]].&lt;ref&gt;MacAdam 1981, p.103.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Technical definition==
Associated with each type of [[spectral power distribution]], one and only one [[color space|color solid]] can be constructed in a uniform [[CIE 1931 color space|color space]].&lt;ref&gt;MacAdam 1981, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proved that this color solid comprises all the object colors producible under illumination of that spectral power distribution with one unit [[luminous flux]],&lt;ref&gt;MacAdam 1981, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; and the volume of the color solid determines the upper limit for the number of the object colors producible under the given spectral power distribution with one unit luminous flux.&lt;ref&gt;Xu 2010, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This volume of the color solid associated with the spectral power distribution is called the color rendering capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Xu 2010, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be expressed as a proportion of the volume of the color solid associated with the [[Standard illuminant#Illuminant E|equal energy spectrum]], and is output in this form from computer software known as "CRC99".

==Sample values==
The color rendering capacity is 0.35 for [[sodium-vapor lamp|high-pressure sodium lamps]], 0.97 for "Deluxe" [[fluorescent lamp]]s, and 1.00 for equal energy spectrum respectively. These results conform with everyday experience: high pressure sodium lamps are rarely used in stores for commodity lighting, as the commodities would appear in monotonous yellow shades while the same commodities under deluxe fluorescent, at the same light level, display a much wider variety of colors. The [[CIELUV|color solid]] and the color rendering capacity calculated for the spectrum of the Deluxe fluorescent lamp F7 is shown on the right.[[File:Color Rendering Capacity of F7.png|thumb|The color solid and the color rendering capacity associated with the spectral power distribution of the Deluxe fluorescent lamps]]

The '''confession album''', or '''confession book''',&lt;ref&gt;So called by e. g. A. A. Milne, ''Not that it Matters '', London: Methuen (1921), 79; ''Once a Week '', London: Methuen (1922), 180.&lt;/ref&gt; was a kind of [[autograph book]] popular in late nineteenth century Britain.  Instead of leaving free room for invented or remembered poetry, it provided a formulaic catechism.  The genre died out towards the end of the century, with occasional brief revivals in the twentieth century.  The same kind of form is now found in the Dutch ''vriendenboek'' ("friends  book") and German ''Freundschaftsbuch'' ("friendship book"), used by small children; and the questions that the confession album contained live on in the [[Proust Questionnaire]] often used for celebrity interviews.

==Questions==
The questions posed in a confession album varied from volume to volume.  A typical set of questions, in a book from the 1860s, is given below along with the answers of one respondent (see picture, right). The same set of questions were presented to Queen Victoria's second son, [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in 1873,&lt;ref&gt;The earliest dated answer in the album pictured is 1868.  Prince Alfred's answers are given in A.M. Broadley, ''Chats on Autographs'', London: T. Fisher Unwin (1910), 148-51, with the comment: "It is not often that Royalty honours one of those irritating social tortures entitled 'An Album of Confessions to Record Thoughts and Feelings.'" ([https://archive.org/details/chatsonautograph00broaiala online] at archive.org).
&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Marcel Proust]] around 1885 and to [[Claude Debussy]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Touttavoult (1990), 14-17 (Proust) and 138-9 (Debussy).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the questions found in other albums, several seem designed to help courtship, sometimes with a reflection of changing relations between the sexes, for instance "What is your opinion of the girl of the period?", " What is your opinion of the man of the period?"&lt;ref&gt;Matthews (2000), 137-8; 141; 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Britain and America===
[[File:Confessions cover.JPG|right|thumb|The cover of a confession album from the late 1860s]]
The origins of the confession album are unclear. Samantha Matthews notes the similarity to oracle games of the first half of the nineteenth century (she cites examples from 1810 to 1852).  These interactive books, which bore titles such as ''The Young Lady's Oracle: A Fireside Amusement'', included questions that resemble those of the confession albums (for instance "Which is your favourite flower?", "Which is your favourite historical character?"), including sexually distinguished questions appropriate to courtship (for instance, "What is the character of your lady love?", "What is the character of him you love?").&lt;ref&gt;Matthews (2000), 126-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever their origins, confession albums were an established form by the 1860s: Henry d'Ideville records using an album in 1861 (see [[#Germany and France|Germany and France]] below); [[Karl Marx]] filled out answers to one in the spring of 1865 (his favourite colour was red); and [[Friedrich Engels]] answered another in 1868 (his idea of happiness was [[Château Margaux]] 1848).&lt;ref&gt;''Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Collected Works'', London: Lawrence and Wishart, vol. 42 (1987), 567 and 674 (Marx); vol 43 (1988), 541 (Engels). For online transcriptions of the Marx and Engels confessions, and a reproduction of his entry in Jenny's confession book, see [[#External links|External links]]. Marx filled out answers on two other occasions, including one for his daughter Jenny's confession album, the book from which Engels' confession is taken.  Omura et al. (2005) contains a facsimile of this album with some commentary and a (slightly inaccurate) transcription.&lt;/ref&gt; Early albums often had blank pages into which owners would paste the questionnaires; the questions on these could be preprinted or handwritten.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlbecher (2007), 26.&lt;/ref&gt; One such album with handwritten questions, was that of Karl Marx's daughter [[Jenny Longuet|Jenny]], which contains entries dated from 1865 to 1870.  For some of these, she sent the questions to friends, asking them to fill them out and return them.  Her comments in a letter of November 1865 suggest that she regarded the genre as a novelty:&lt;ref&gt;Omura et al. (2005), 24-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have a whole book filled up in that way and the answers are very amusing when compared with one another.  These Confession books have put albums and stamp books quite into the shade.  … I should much like to have answers.  It is more interesting and amusing than a mere Autograph.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the end of the decade, the printed and bound confession book had been introduced.  The earliest currently known example with a printed publication date is ''Mental Photographs'', an album published in New York in 1869, which contained place for a photograph as well as the set of questions (a combination already found in Jenny Marx's album).&lt;ref&gt;R. Saxton (ed.), ''Mental Photographs. An Album for Confessions of Tastes, Habits and Convictions'' New York: Leypoldt &amp; Holt (1869). See Kolhbecher (2007), 25-6; 28-9; 32. The questions elicited a satirical response from [[Mark Twain]], "Mental Photographs", published in ''Mark Twain's Sketches'', London: Routledge (1872), 148-9 ([https://archive.org/details/marktwainssketc00clemgoog online] at archive.org).&lt;/ref&gt; The albums seem to have enjoyed their greatest popularity in the following decades, but to have become unfashionable by the early years of the twentieth century.  At their height, confession albums were widespread enough that in 1883 [[Douglas Sladen]] could rely on readers' familiarity with the form to play on it with a poetical answer.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. B. Sladen, "A Confession. (Written for a Lady's Character Book)" in ''Australian Lyrics'', Melbourne and Sydney: George Robertson (1883), 39-40. The poem is quoted and discussed in Matthews (2000), 139-40.&lt;/ref&gt; He begins:&lt;blockquote&gt;
My favorite  virtue, I confess, is chivalrous devotedness,&lt;br /&gt;
My favorite quality in man, the manful genius that can&lt;br /&gt;
With iron will and eye sublime, up to the heights of empire climb;&lt;br /&gt;
Although in woman, as I think, gentleness is perfection's pink
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This ubiquity was accompanied by a certain exasperation.  In a novel of 1886, a character asks:&lt;ref&gt;Annie G. Savigny, ''A heart-song of to-day (disturbed by fire from the 'unruly member')'', Toronto: Hunter Rose (1886), Chapter 31 ([http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7184 online] at Project Gutenberg).&lt;/ref&gt; "''A propos'' of the confessional, did any of you ever come under the torture of that modern Inquisition, the 'Confession Book?'"  Early twentieth century writers look back on the books as a long unfashionable genre.  A writer in 1915 records:&lt;ref&gt;C.F. ''Really &amp; Truly: A Book of Literary Confessions: Designed by a Late-Victorian'' London: Arthur L. Humphreys (1915), 7, cited in Matthews (2000), 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
So far as I can recollect it was voted a bore at the end of the 'seventies and, except in suburban homes, such as my own, was never referred to except with a yawn or a smile after the early eighties.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;The ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'' in 1906 remarks:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' s.v. "confession" III.9 and in Matthews (2000), 132; similarly Jerome K. Jerome, ''Idle Ideas in 1905'' London: Hurst &amp; Brackett (1905), 25, speculates about a future revival of the "old confession book".&lt;/ref&gt; "'If not yourself, who would you rather be?' was a favourite question of the confession album of the seventies." [[A. A. Milne]] (1882–1956) looked back in 1921 on the album as something from his childhood:&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Milne, ''Not that it Matters'', London: Methuen (1921), 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The confession-book, I suppose, has disappeared. It is twenty years since I have seen one. As a boy I told some inquisitive owner what was my favourite food (porridge, I fancy), my favourite hero in real life and in fiction, my favourite virtue in woman, and so forth.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some album producers saw [[World War I]] as an opportunity to revive the confession book.  The new albums, unlike their Victorian predecessors, ignored questions appropriate to courtship.  They were clearly intended to be filled out by soldiers, a point spelt out in the title of one: ''My Brave Friend's Confession Book'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;Matthews (2000), 132; 147-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany and France===
According to Henry d'Ideville, he had an "album-questionnaire" in which he collected the responses of friends and acquaintances in 1861, when as a diplomat in Naples he took the answers of [[Urbano Rattazzi]] and [[Laetitia Marie Wyse Bonaparte|Mme de Solms]], which he reproduces.  His account, written in 1872, explains the nature of the album, as though he did not expect readers to be familiar with it:&lt;ref&gt;H. d'Ideville, ''Journal d'un diplomate en Italie, Notes intimes pour servir à l'historie du second empire, Turin 1859-1862'', Paris: Hachette, 1872, 101 "Voici en quoi consiste l'opération: On adresse au malheureux interrogé une série de questions auxquelles il doit répondre successivement. – Quel poëte? quelle occupation? quel plaisir? quelle sensation, etc., etc., préférez-vous? Les réponses sont inscrites, puis la personne signe, date son interrogatoire et le tour est joué."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Here is what the operation consists of: you pose a series of questions to the unfortunate subject of the interrogation and he has to answer them one after the other. – What poet, what painter, what occupation, what pleasure, what sensation, etc. etc. do you prefer? The answers are written down, then the person signs and dates his interrogation and that's the game over.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

British confession albums also circulated on the continent (see [[#Questions|Questions]] above), and (perhaps in imitation of them) there were also questionnaire books in other languages.  In Germany there were several, notably ''Erkenne Dich Selbst!'' ("Know Yourself"), which first appeared in 1878 and survived to around 1900, going through at least 22 impressions, produced by Friedrich Kirchner (1848–1900). The ''Leipziger Illustrirte Zeitung'', which belonged to the same publishers as Kirchner's album, set his questions to celebrities, a forerunner of the modern use as the [[#Proust Questionnaire|Proust Questionnaire]]; facsimiles of these answers were in turn printed in the album. In France, two are known, both containing the word ''Confidences'' in the title to represent the English "confessions".  Here too the ''Revue illustrée'' set confession album questions to the famous, including Zola and Verlaine.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlbecher (2007), 28-9; 33-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revivals==

===Friendship books===
In the Netherlands, where autograph books are very popular among young schoolchildren, publishers have recently started bringing out an alternative in the so-called ''vriendenboek'' or ''vriendjesboek'' ("Friends book"), which much like the confession album come preprinted with a set of questions about the respondents' hobbies, idols and wishes.  Some children prefer the new format, which says more about the person answering, but most prefer the traditional autograph book, which leaves more room for their own creativity.&lt;ref&gt;M. Van den Berg, "Zur Erinnerung, Poesiealben aus Flandern", ''Acta Ethnographica Hungarica'' 44 (1999), 247-59 (on this point 249).&lt;/ref&gt;  The modern German ''Freundschaftsbuch'' ("Friendship book") has the same kind of preprinted questions and is typically aimed at the same age group.&lt;ref&gt;For instance ''Pettersson und Findus - Alle meine Freunde'', illustrated by Sven Nordquist, Oetinger (2005), {{ISBN|978-3-7891-1330-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proust Questionnaire===
{{main article|Proust Questionnaire}}
In 1886, [[Marcel Proust]], then a child of fourteen, filled out the answers to an English confession album, which bore the title ''Confessions. An Album to Record Thoughts, Feelings, &amp;c.'' (his answers were auctioned in 2003 for $34,000).&lt;ref&gt;L. Van Gelder, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/05/theater/arts-briefing.html Arts briefing]", ''New York Times'', May 5, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in Proust led to a later revival of the questions as a kind of formulaic interview for celebrities, first by Léonce Peillard in France in the 1950s, later in French and American television and in the magazine of the German ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', starting in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;Kohlbecher (2007), 25; 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' since 1993, under the name of "The Proust Questionnaire", which disguises its unintellectual British origins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/archives/features/proust "Proust Questionnaire"].&lt;/ref&gt; This use too had been anticipated by nineteenth century journals (see [[#Germany and France|Germany and France]]).

===Slam Books===
{{main article|Slam book}}
A slam book is a notebook (commonly the spiral-bound type) which is passed among children and teenagers. The keeper of the book starts by posing a question (which may be on any subject) and the book is then passed round for each contributor to fill in their own answer to the question

'''''Dindsenchas''''' or ''Dindshenchas'' (modern spellings: ''Dinnseanchas'' or ''Dinnsheanchas'' or ''Dinnṡeanċas''), meaning "lore of places"&lt;ref&gt;''dind'' "notable place"; ''senchas'' "old tales, ancient history, tradition" - ''[[Dictionary of the Irish Language]]'', Compact Edition, 1990, pp. 215, 537&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Irish language|modern Irish]] word ''dinnseanchas'' means "[[topography]]"),&lt;ref&gt;''Collins Pocket Irish Dictionary'' p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; is a class of [[onomastic]] text in [[early Irish literature]], recounting the origins of place-names and traditions concerning events and characters associated with the places in question. Since many of the legends being related also concern the acts of mythic and legendary figures, the ''dindsenchas'' has been an important source for the study of [[Irish mythology]].

The literary corpus of the ''dindsenchas'' comprises about 176 poems plus a number of prose commentaries and independent prose tales (the so-called "prose ''dindsenchas''" is often distinguished from the "verse", "poetic" or "metrical ''dindsenchas''"). As a compilation the ''dindsenchas'' has survived in two different [[:wikt:recension|recensions]]. The first recension is found in the ''[[Book of Leinster]]'', a manuscript of the 12th century, with partial survivals in a number of other manuscript sources. The text shows signs of having been compiled from a number of provincial sources and the earliest poems date from at least the 11th century. The second recension survives more or less intact in thirteen different manuscripts, mostly dating from the 14th and 15th centuries. This recension contains a number of poems composed after the Book of Leinster text. ''Dindsenchas'' stories are also incorporated into saga texts such as ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'' and ''[[Acallam na Senórach]]''.

Although they are known today from these written sources, the ''dindsenchas'' are clearly a product of [[oral literature]] and are structured so as to be a [[mnemonic aid]] as well as a form of entertainment. They are far from an accurate history of how places came to be named. Many of the explanations given are made to fit the name and not the other way around, especially in the many cases where a place was much older than the [[Middle Irish]] spoken at the time of the poems' composition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/jce/dindsenchas.html Jones Celtic Encyclopedia: Dindsenchas]&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the ''dindsenchas'' poets may have invented names for places when the name of a place, if it had one, was not known to them. A detailed analysis points to a pre-Christian origin for most of the tales. For example, many placenames appear which had fallen out of use by the 5th century A.D., when Irish written records began to appear in quantity. Furthermore [[County Clare]] is given as part of [[Connaught]] suggesting a date before ~610 AD and the Battle of Knocklong. {{Citation needed|reason=Many modern scholars would disagree|date=November 2018}} Christian references, and the Graeco-Roman myths and tales of Pagan atrocity associated with that influence are also mostly absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Notes and Folklore from the Rennes Copy of the "Dindsenchas"| first = T.

Knowledge of the real or putative history of local places formed an important part of the education of the elite in ancient Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

It was also essential knowledge for the bardic caste, who were expected to recite poems answering questions on place name origins as part of their professional duties. Consequently, the ''dindshenchas'' may well have grown by accretion from local texts compiled in schools as a way of teaching about places in their area.

[[Edward Gwynn]] compiled and translated ''dindsenchas'' poems from the ''[[Lebor na hUidre]]'', the ''[[Book of Leinster]]'', the ''[[Rennes Manuscript]]'', the ''[[Book of Ballymote]]'', the ''[[Great Book of Lecan]]'' and the ''[[Yellow Book of Lecan]]'' in ''The Metrical Dindshenchas'', published in four parts between 1903 and 1924, with a general introduction and indices published as a fifth part in 1935.

The '''Doña María de Aragón Altarpiece''' was an altarpiece painted between 1596 and 1599 by [[El Greco]] for the chapel of the [[Palacio del Senado (Spain)|Colegio de la Encarnación de Madrid]] (also known as the Colegio de doña María de Aragón). There has been much speculation over which paintings belonged to the work - there is now consensus that it consisted of six large canvases and a seventh, now lost. Five of those six canvases are now in the [[Prado]] and the sixth is in the [[National Museum of Art of Romania]] in Bucharest.

==History==
&lt;!---
En [[1596]] el Greco, se comprometió a realizar el retablo de la iglesia del colegio, un seminario de la [[Orden de San Agustín|orden agustina]]. El nombre popular alude a [[María de Aragón]], la mecenas que pagó las obras. El Greco recibió el encargo del [[Consejo de Castilla]], que se había hecho cargo de las obras después de la muerte de doña María. Existen documentos que atestiguan que debía realizarse en tres años y se valoró el trabajo en algo más de sesenta y tres mil [[Real español|reales]], el precio más alto que consiguió en su vida. Sin embargo no hay referencias del número de cuadros que lo formaban, ni de la estructura del retablo, ni de la temática tratada. [[Ceán Bermúdez]], dos siglos después, dijo que las pinturas trataban el [[ciclo de la vida de Cristo]].&lt;ref name=ruiz1&gt; Ruiz Gómez, op. cit., p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

El colegio se cerró en [[1808]] o [[1809]], pues según dos decretos de [[José Bonaparte]] en esas fechas se redujeron los conventos existentes y posteriormente se eliminaron las órdenes religiosas. El edificio se transformó en [[salón de Cortes]] en 1814 y entre 1820 y 1823; periodo en el que el retablo permaneció desmontado. Aunque desde 1823 el local recuperó su función de iglesia, únicamente se debió montar el lienzo central de la Anunciación. En 1835 volvió a utilizarse como sede de una institución política: el [[Estamento de Próceres]], posteriormente denominado Senado. Con diferentes vicisitudes, esa función se ha mantenido hasta la actualidad.&lt;ref name=ruiz1 /&gt;

El conjunto de pinturas debió ser trasladado en [[1813]] al convento agustino de [[San Felipe el Real]] y a la Casa de la [[Inquisición española|Inquisición]]. Posteriormente a la [[Real Academia de San Fernando]], y de allí al [[Museo de la Trinidad]], creado con obras de arte requisadas en virtud de la Ley de [[Desamortización (España)|Desamortización]]. Dicho museo se fusionó con el Museo del Prado en [[1872]] y de esta forma cinco de los lienzos del retablo terminaron en esta institución. Durante estos traslados se perdería la [[mazonería]]&lt;ref&gt;''Obra de relieve'' {{cita DRAE|mazonería}}&lt;/ref&gt; del retablo; mientras que el sexto lienzo, ''la Adoración de los pastores'', fue vendido y, después de varios cambios de propiedad, terminó en la colección real rumana en [[1888]], de donde pasó en 1948 al [[Museo Nacional de Arte de Rumanía]] de [[Bucarest]].&lt;ref name=ruiz1 /&gt;
---&gt;

== Composition ==
&lt;!---
La ausencia de documentos sobre el encargo que describan los cuadros han originado distintas hipótesis sobre el número de cuadros y los temas en ellos tratados. En [[1908]] [[Manuel Bartolomé Cossío|Cossío]] señaló la relación entre ''el Bautismo'', ''la Crucifixión'', [[La resurrección de Cristo (El Greco)|''la Resurrección'']] y ''[[la Anunciación]]''. [[August L. Mayer]] propuso en 1931 la relación entre los lienzos anteriores con ''el Pentecostés'' del Museo del Prado y ''la Adoración de los pastores'' de Bucarest. En [[1943]], Manuel Gómez Moreno conjeturó un retablo reticular formado por estos seis cuadros sin argumentarlo. Esta hipótesis no se ha tenido en cuenta hasta cuarenta años después pues para algunos especialistas ''la Resurrección'' y ''el Pentecostés'' corresponden a formulaciones estilísticas diferentes. Hasta [[1985]] la crítica especializada ha realizado distintas formulaciones al respecto, en general rechazando los dos últimos cuadros como pertenecientes al retablo.&lt;ref name=ruiz2&gt; Ruiz Gómez, op. cit., p.76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

En 1985 se conoció una relación anónima fechada en [[1814]] en la que se registraban las obras depositadas en la casa de la Inquisición. En este listado se aludía al retablo mayor del colegio de doña María depositado en la sala carbonera y se hablaba de ''siete quadros de pinturas originales de Domenico Greco que estaban en el Altar Mayor''. Esta información ha afianzado la hipótesis de Gómez Moreno de un retablo de tres calles en dos pisos. Como en la relación se habla de siete cuadros se ha supuesto que el séptimo se trataría de un cuadro pequeño dispuesto en un tercer piso a modo de ático.&lt;ref name=ruiz2 /&gt;

La estructura de este retablo estaría compuesta en el piso inferior por ''la Anunciación'' en el centro con ''el Bautismo'' y ''la Adoración de los pastores de Bucarest'' a cada lado. Mientrás que en el piso superior en el centro se dispondría ''la Crucifixión'' y a sus lados ''la Resurrección'' y ''el Pentecostés''. Según José Milicua esta organización tiene coherencia histórico-teológica subrayando el sentido redentorista del retablo, pues ''la Crucifixión'' (piso superior) sería el momento culminante de la redención iniciada en ''la encarnación de María'' (piso inferior). ''La Adoración'' y ''la Resurrección'' serían la aparición y despedida del Salvador entre los hombres, mientras que ''el Bautismo'' y ''Pentecostés'' ilustrarían el descenso del [[Espíritu Santo]] sobre Cristo y sobre la comunidad apostólica.&lt;ref name=ruiz2 /&gt;

&lt;!---
Los temas, salvo el de Pentecostés, habían sido desarrollados ya en otras ocasiones, algunos desde su etapa italiana. Según Ruiz Gómez estos temas son retomados con gran originalidad mostrando su espiritualidad más expresionista. A partir de este momento su obra toma un camino muy personal y desconcertante distanciándose del estilo naturalista que comenzaba a dominar en aquella época. Las escenas están planteadas en espacios claustrofóbicos potenciando la verticalidad de los formatos. Una luz espectral destaca la irrealidad de las figuras, algunas en escorzos muy marcados. El color frío, intenso y contrastado aplicado con soltura a sus poderosas construcciones anatómicas muestra su estilo tardío característico.&lt;ref name=ruiz3&gt; Ruiz Gómez, op. cit., p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The EServer''' is an [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] electronic publishing cooperative, founded in 1990,&lt;ref name="EServer_DLF"&gt;{{cite web | first=Martha L. | last=Brogan |author2=Daphnée Rentfrow | publisher=Digital Library Federation | date=September 2005 | url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub132/pub132.pdf#page=82 | title=A Kaleidoscope of Digital American Literature | accessdate=2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes writings in the arts and humanities free of charge to Internet readers. In 2006, it was rated by [[Alexa internet|Alexa]] as the most popular arts and humanities website in the world.&lt;ref name="EServer_Alexa"&gt;{{cite web | author=Alexa | authorlink=Alexa_Internet | date=December 2006 | url=http://www.alexa.com/browse/general/?&amp;CategoryID=53942&amp;SortBy=Popularity | title=Alexa:Sites in Humanities | accessdate=2006-12-12 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102165721/http://www.alexa.com/browse/general?&amp;CategoryID=53942&amp;SortBy=Popularity | archivedate=2007-11-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, the EServer published more than 32,000 works.&lt;ref name="EServer_DLF"/&gt; In December 2006 it hosted approximately 66,000 readers per day (two million per month).&lt;ref name="EServer_Readership"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=EServer.org | date=2009-12-13 | title=EServer Recent Readership | url=http://about.eserver.org/RecentReadership/ | accessdate=2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martha L. Brogan and Daphnée Rentfrow wrote in 2005 that it has "more than 200 active members, including editors of an eclectic mix of 45 discrete 'collections' (Web sites), which 'publish' more than 32,000 works."&lt;ref name="EServer_DLF"/&gt; [[Duke University Library]] rates the EServer among the "best overall directories for literary information on the Web."&lt;ref name="EServer_Duke"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Duke University Library]] | date=September 2004 | url=http://www.lib.duke.edu/collect/english/sites.html | title=Web Sites of Interest to Literature Scholars | accessdate=2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of collection==
The EServer publishes written works in the arts and humanities, largely (but not exclusively) those from the Western cultural tradition. In addition to literature such as poetry, novels, drama and short stories, the EServer publishes seven scholarly journals. Most releases are in English, but there are also significant numbers in many other languages. Whenever possible, EServer publications are released in open standards, such as [[XHTML]].

==History==
[[Image:eserver 1996.jpg|frame|right|The EServer, 1996]]
The EServer was founded in 1990, when a group of graduate students set up their office computer in "Trailer H" on the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] campus network to permit them to collaborate with one another. In 1991, with the addition of more disk space, it became an Internet network server designed to provide public access (via [[FTP]], [[telnet]] and [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] to literary research, criticism, novels, and writings from various humanities disciplines.

The site, originally called the English Server, was dedicated to publishing works in the arts and humanities free of charge to Internet readers. It was developed to assist leisure reading in particular, following a study by [[Geoffrey Sauer]] (the site's director) into the rapid and significant increase of books in the United States post-1979 and a consequent decrease in leisure readings among young Americans. By 1992 it was an extremely popular [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] and [[FTP]] site, and by 1993 had a significant [[World Wide Web]] presence.

Its original Internet domain name was "english-server.hss.cmu.edu", which later became "english-www.hss.cmu.edu", then "english.hss.cmu.edu", then "eng.hss.cmu.edu". In the years since, the name was shortened to "eserver.org", and it is usually referred to as "EServer."

==Ideals==
Contemporary publishing tend to place highest value on works that sell to broad markets. Quick turnover, high-visibility marketing campaigns for bestsellers, and corporate "superstore" bookstores have all made it less common for unique and older texts to be published. [[Geoffrey Sauer]] has argued that the costs this marketing adds to all books discourage people from leisure reading as a common practice. Publishers, he argues, then tend to encourage authors to write books with strong appeal to the current, undermining (if unknowingly) writings with longer-term implications.&lt;ref name="EServer_Sauer"&gt;{{cite web | first=Geoffrey | last=Sauer | publisher=Lectures on Demand | date=April 2000 | url=http://lectures.eserver.org/1015 | title=The Place of the Internet in the History of Publishing | accessdate=2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

'''Friedrich Adler''' (29 April 1878 – ca. 11 July 1942) was a [[Germany|German]] [[academia|academic]], [[artist]] and [[designer]]. He was especially renowned for his accomplishments in designing metalwork in the [[Art nouveau]] and [[Art deco]] styles; he was also the first designer to use [[bakelite]].

Adler was born in [[Laupheim]]; his birthplace is now the ''Café Hermes'', an Art nouveau building in the style of the late [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | title = The Jewish Past of Laupheim: The Adler Family  | work =   | publisher =   | url = http://www.culturespace.de/laupheim/english/adler.htm  | doi =   | accessdate = 2010-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1894 to 1897, he studied under [[Hermann Obrist]] and [[Wilhelm von Debschitz]], in whose [[wikt:atelier|atelier]] he also taught from 1904 to 1907, at the School for [[Applied Art]] in [[Munich]]. From 1907 to 1933, he taught at the [[Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg|School for Applied Art in Hamburg]]. In between, he also directed the mastery lessons in [[Nuremberg]], and was busy designing pieces in applied art for over fifty clients.

On 11 July 1942 Adler, who was [[Jew]]ish, was deported to the [[extermination camp]] [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], where, judged too old to work, he was killed soon afterwards. There is a [[stolperstein]] in his memory at his last place of employment in Hamburg.

A '''human video''' is a form of [[theater]] combining [[music]], [[Modern Dance]] and [[drama]], along with [[interpretive dance]], [[American Sign Language]], [[pantomime]], and [[Mime artistry|classic mime]]. A human video consists of a [[song]] or [[Medley (music)|medley]] played over loudspeakers while actors use rhythmic physical movement (gestures and other movements of the limbs and body) to communicate emotions to a given audience.

The performance is presented in a form similar to a [[music video]]. It presents a story that illuminates a particular artistic intent through [[Proxemics|spatial relationships]], meaningful [[gesture]]s, and artistic [[Kinesics|movement]]. 

The story told within the video can be either implicit in the words of the song or a story written independently of the original artist's meaning.

Just as more "traditional" forms of theater can be situated on different types of [[Stage (theater)|stages]], so too can these dramatic acts. This particular form of drama can perform the same text in many different venues without disrupting its meaning. Because it typically has no [[Set construction|set]] and limited [[costume]]s, it can be performed in nearly any location.

[[Theatrical property|Props]] are sometimes used, but are forbidden in some competitive venues. In this instance, props are restricted in an effort to force creativity—because in the ideal Human Video, all actors on stage should be used to represent objects like [[Crucifix|crosses]], thrones, trees or giants. Actors movements demonstrate a [[narrative|story]] and the [[Theme (literature)|theme]] of the [[song]] being played.

In the [[United States]], one example of how human videos have permeated the [[Culture of the United States|culture]] is the inclusion of human videos in Fine Arts Festivals and church ministry groups ([[Assemblies of God]], [[Pentecostal]] Holiness Church, [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]], etc.) in a variety of [[Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]]. The Fine Arts Festival in the Assemblies of God denomination is the largest and most intense of all competitions and categories. Churches spend many months and countless hours practicing in order to receive recognition at the National Fine Arts Festival.

==History==
The name "human video" was coined by Randy Phillips. He is reported to have performed the first "human video" in a chapel service at Central Bible College, with several elements used from the then quite popular Deaf Ministry Team. It was used more formally in the early 1990s at Phoenix First Assembly of God led by Pastor Tommy Barnett.

Although elements of the form have existed in theatre for centuries and no one can actually claim to have invented it, Mr. Phillips began to use it as a ministry tool first at church services and then for outreach and missions with the help of Pastor Lloyd Ziegler and the ministry training program called Master's Commission.

'''Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe''' (born UK 1945, US resident since 1968) is a painter, art critic, theorist, and educator.  His work is in the permanent collections of the Albright-Knox Gallery of Art, Buffalo, NY; The Getty Study Center, Los Angeles; the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami; the Frederick R. Weisman Foundation in Los Angeles and Minneapolis; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and other public, corporate and private collections.

==Painting==
 
Gilbert-Rolfe has shown in New York fairly regularly since 1970, and sporadically elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5362f455e4b0609f727f6d57/t/56735e5c69492e0c12769451/1450401372705/JGR+CV+%282015%29+pdf.pd Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe curriculum vitae]&lt;/ref&gt;  
Regarding the general consensus that describes his work as ‘Geometric Abstraction,’ Gilbert-Rolfe says he wishes people would think about what he does with the category rather than how his work fits into it. He says he went to an exhibition at the Tate Gallery in London in 1963 to see the Pop art that was in it but what caught his attention instead, causing him to decide he needed to go to America, were the paintings of the New York School and especially and specifically Barnett Newman’s Vir Heroicus Sublimis (1951.)  The space in it felt as active as the space in Howard Hawkes’ Red River, which had entered his imagination when he was a child and stayed there.  Rachel Kushner discusses his indebtedness to Newman and Hawkes, and much else in the work and practice, going on to say that she made an “automatic and instinctive” association of his painting Hottest Part of the Day (2001) with a poem of Sappho’s, and that it is her “sense that Gilbert-Rolfe has some uncanny mesh with feminine sensibilities… (His) electric verdure pulses—seductive, then bewildering, then seductive.  Boucher, then radiator coolant, then Boucher.”&lt;ref name=Kushner&gt;{{cite book|contributor=Rachel Kushner|contribution=Warfare and Pleasure:  Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe’s Paintings|editor=Rex Butler|title=Art after Deconstruction: Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe|location=Brisbane|publisher=Editions 3|date=2011|page=136|isbn= 9780646552972|author=Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Flattered by Kushner’s suggestion, he is however inclined to resist her further suggestion that “A line is a kind of violence, cutting the canvas as though it’s cutting a body.  But color is violence as well, if of a soft, smothering sort.  A smothering of reason.”&lt;ref name=Kushner/&gt;  Aside from wondering whether a drawn line doesn’t only divide but also connect, he is unwilling to accept the smothering of reason part.  He says “his paintings are about complexity and as such have come to be about logic as much as anything else.  Not logic as in philosophy, logic as in music, where one talks of it making sense but does not mean it provides a riddle and its answer.  I want the work to interact with the viewer, to take place in the space around itself and between itself and the person looking at it, and to hold the attention for some time.”&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe, “Statement” http://www.jeremygilbert-rolfe.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also said that seriousness is generally identified with terror, “but I want to identify it with questions of the formless… Art has to put you in touch with something that’s not manageable…. (but) it’s time to get rid of … tough-guy rhetoric about the sublime.  Among other things, it would permit us to get closer to the sublime or sublimes that tough guys are too scared to touch.”&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Clearwater, “Interview with Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe” Butler (ed) p.104&lt;/ref&gt;  As Kushner puts it, “Gilbert-Rolfe … lays out his ante, but never knows where a painting will go.”&lt;ref name=Kushner/&gt;  
In 2010 he and Rebecca Norton began to work together as the collaboration Awkward x 2, making paintings together and also writing occasional blogs.  Awkward has shown in Brooklyn, Chicago and Louisville to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lecture for Chicago|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=October 2012|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2012/10/artseen/lecture-for-chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art Criticism and Theory==
Gilbert-Rolfe writes about art and related topics, including poetry, fiction, fashion, with particular regard to its interaction with photography, technology, and the general state of things in art and how the present situation seems to have emerged.  His publications include two anthologies of his essays,&lt;ref&gt;Immanence and Contradiction: Recent Essays on the Artistic Device (New York: Out of
London Press, 1986).
Beyond Piety: Critical Essays on the Visual Arts, 1986-1993 (Cambridge and New York:
Cambridge University Press, 1995).
&lt;/ref&gt; a book about Frank Gehry’s architecture co-authored with the architect,&lt;ref&gt;With Frank Gehry, Frank Gehry, The City and Music (London and New York: Routledge, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime''''',&lt;ref&gt;Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime (New York: Allworth Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; '''and other essays and reviews.'''  
''Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime'' reformulates the traditional definition of the differential relationship between beauty and the sublime, in which beauty is a sign of the passive and feminine and the sublime of the active and male—heroic or terrifying depending on one’s perspective, or of course both.  In Gilbert-Rolfe’s version Winckelmann’s masculine active becomes instead androgynous transitivity, while intransitivity replaces passivity as a still entirely feminine characteristic, the feminine as intransitivity being a sign or force that stands for, or embodies, power as a kind of powerlessness.  As well as redefining the differential, ''Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime''’s argument also relocates the sublime from nature to technology, and with it subjectivity, from wherever it imagined itself to be to within techno-capitalism.  Here and elsewhere Gilbert-Rolfe suggests that techno-capitalism and the subjectivity that accompanies it are largely made out of all that Heidegger warns against and denounces in his post-war essays on technology, for example the telephone’s capacity to sever the mutual dependence of space and time.   He has returned to some aspects of this argument in two essays in particular.&lt;ref&gt;“Attractiveness and the Uncontrollable, an Update” in Rex Butler, editor, contributions by Rex Butler, Bonnie Clearwater, Penny Florence, and Rachel Kushner Art After Deconstruction: Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe, (Brisbane: Editions 3, 2012)

“Uncertainty Prone to Vulgarity” in Temenuga Trifonova, editor, Contemporary Visual Culture and the Sublime (Routledge Advances in Art and Visual Studies) (London and New York: Routledge, 2018)
&lt;/ref&gt;  
Starting out in Artforum, in 1973, he has written something at least once for most of the art magazines over the years, and more often for Critical Inquiry and Bomb.  A founding editor of October, with Rosalind Krauss, Annette Michelson and Lucio Pozzi (who withdrew before the first issue was published,)  Gilbert-Rolfe resigned from the journal after the third issue.

==Honors==
For painting, Gilbert-Rolfe has been honored by two National Endowment for the Arts fellowships (1979, 1989,) a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship (1997,) the Francis Greenberger Award (2001,) and a Pollock-Krasner Fellowship (2017.)  He was awarded an NEA fellowship in criticism in 1974 and was the 1998 recipient of the College Art Association’s Frank Jewett Mather Award for Art and Architectural Criticism.

==Teaching==
Gilbert-Rolfe retired from teaching at Art Center College of Design in 2015 receiving the title Professor/Chair Emeritus.  He had worked there since 1986, when he was hired to develop an MFA program for the school; before that he taught at Princeton and Cal Arts.

==Other info==
Gilbert-Rolfe has been married twice and has two children, Cyrus, from his first marriage to Jennifer, and Cedric from the second to Annie.  Between them his sons have generated three grandchildren, Harley, Leiah, and Vincent (formerly Maisie.)  Having lived in New York and Los Angeles for forty years, he and Annie now live in Gainesville, Florida.  They have a large garden.

The '''Latona Fountain''' in the [[Gardens of Versailles]] lies in the Latona Basin between the [[Chateau de Versailles]] and the [[Gardens of Versailles|Grand Canal]]. On the top tier, there is a statue of the [[goddess]] [[Latona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://iledefrance.ca/versailles/basinlatona.html Latona Fountain]&lt;/ref&gt; The fountain operates three times a week during the high season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chateauversaillesspectacles.fr/spectacle.php?spe=1&amp;lang=eng Musical fountains show], chateauversaillesspectacles.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

The [[fountain]] is [[Wedding cake|wedding-cake]] style, designed by [[Gaspard and Balthazard Marsy|Balthazar Marsy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://iledefrance.ca/versailles/basinlatona.html Latona Fountain]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the goddess Latona are her children, [[Apollo]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. The second and third tiers of the fountain have frogs (see next section), while the lowest tier has turtles and alligators.

==Myth==

Latona turned the [[Lyceum|Lycean]] [[peasant]]s into frogs when they refused to give her water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaeltaylor.ca/Culture/herr07.shtml Herrenchiemsee Photos] Latona Fountain&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

The Latona Fountain has been cited as inspiration for [[Buckingham Fountain]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buckingham Fountain|url=http://www.cpdit01.com/resources/buckingham_fountain.cfm|publisher=Chicago Park District|accessdate=15 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122220315/http://cpdit01.com/resources/buckingham_fountain.cfm|archivedate=22 January 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization acts as the national association of professional and aspiring poets in Canada.&lt;ref name=New&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Mkh2vJ_9GpEC&amp;pg=PA642#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada |page=642|first=William H. |last=  New |publisher=University of Toronto Press|year= 2002 | accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The League counts [[Phyllis Webb]], [[Robert Kroetsch]], [[Susan McCaslin]], [[Barry Dempster]], [[Gay Allison]], [[Micheline Maylor]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] among its membership;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ps26JhFFS8wC&amp;pg=PA162#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Literary Research and Canadian Literature: Strategies and Sources |page=162 |first=Gabriella Natasha |last= Reznowski |publisher=Scarecrow Press|date= 1 Jan 2011 | accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://poets.ca/members_data/glossary/M |title=www.poets.ca |work=poets.ca |year=2012 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it provides funding for poetry readings and competitions, hosts an annual AGM, runs a series of awards, and publishes an electronic newsletter.&lt;ref name=New/&gt;

== Membership ==
Members of the League are professional poets who are actively contributing to the development, growth, and public profile of poetry in Canada. They offer two primary levels of membership, as well as student and supporting memberships, open to Canadian citizens and permanent residents.&lt;ref name="poets.ca"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poets.ca/join/|title=Join the League! – League of Canadian Poets|website=poets.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full members are poets with an established poetic career, whether with a published book of poetry or a background in performance and spoken word poetry.&lt;ref name="poets.ca"/&gt;

Associate members are poets working towards establishing their careers. Poet Bruce Meyer helped to establish the associate level of membership in the 1970s to enable young poets to join the League.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poets.ca/2016/04/08/meet-the-shortlist-adebe-derango-adem-bruce-meyer/|title=MEET THE SHORTLIST: ADEBE DeRANGO-ADEM &amp; BRUCE MEYER – League of Canadian Poets|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The League organizes the annual [[Pat Lowther Memorial Award]], the [[Gerald Lampert Award]], and the [[Raymond Souster Award]]. The recipient of each award receives an cash honorarium, and there is an administration fee of $25 for each submission.&lt;ref name="Gerald Lampert — Poets.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poets.ca/wordpress/contests-awards/gerald-lampert |title=Gerald Lampert — Poets.ca |work=poets.ca |year=2012 |accessdate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314221718/http://poets.ca/wordpress/contests-awards/gerald-lampert |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7709">This list is limited to the original creators of source material for [[Animation|animated]] [[Film series|movie franchises]] that have each generated over $1 billion from all revenues after only 1 sequel.  Total revenues are defined as [[Box office territory|theatrical markets]] (worldwide box office) plus [[ancillary market]]s (home media, cable, merchandising, books, video games, TV series, theme parks, etc.).  Creators of franchises are divided into two categories and are defined as either one creator who originated the source material alone or multiple creators who originated the source material in collaboration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">'''Magonia''' is the name of the cloud realm whence felonious aerial sailors were said to have come according to the [[polemic]]al treatise by [[Carolingian]] bishop [[Agobard]] of [[Lyon]] in 815, where he argues against weather magic. The treatise is titled ''De Grandine et Tonitruis'' ("On Hail and Thunder").

==Description==
The inhabitants of this realm were said to travel the clouds in ships and worked with Frankish ''[[tempestarii]]'' ("tempest-raisers" or weather-magi) to steal grain from the fields during (magically raised) [[storm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k58288830/f11.image.r=agobard.langFR.swf ''De Grandine et Tonitruis''] pp. 8-10: "Plerosque autem vidimus et audivimus tanta dementia obrutos, tanta stultitia alienatos, ut credant et dicant quandam esse regionem, quæ dicatur Magonia, ex qua naves veniant in nubibus, in quibus fruges, quæ grandinibus decidunt, et tempestatibus pereunt, vehantur in eamdem regionem, ipsis videlicet nautis aëreis dantibus pretia tempestariis, et accipientibus frumenta vel ceteras fruges. Ex his item tam profunda stultitia excoecatis, ut haec posse fieri credant, vidimus plures in quodam conventu hominum exhibere vinctos quatuor homines, tres viros, et unam feminam, quasi qui de ipsis navibus ceciderint; quos scilicet per aliquot dies in vinculis detentos, tandem collecto conventu hominum exhibuerunt, ut dixi, in nostra præsentia, tanquam lapidandos. Sed tamen vincente veritate, post multam ratiocinationem, ipsi qui eos exhibuerant, secundum propheticum illud confusi sunt, ''sicut confunditur fur quando deprehenditur''".

An English translation can be found at the [https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/Agobard-OnHailandThunder.asp Internet Medieval Sourcebook].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Document history==
Agobard's works were lost until 1605, when a manuscript was discovered in Lyons and published by [[Papirius Masson]], and again by [[Baluze]] in 1666. For later editions see [[August Potthast]], ''Bibliotheca Historica Medii Aevi''. The life of Agobard in [[Friedrich Adolf Ebert|Ebert]]'s ''Allgemeine Geschichte der Literatur des Mittelalters im Abendlande'' (1880), Band ii., is still the best one to consult. For further indications see [[A. Molinier]], ''Sources de l'histoire de France'', i. p.&amp;nbsp;235.

==Popular culture==
Magonia is featured in [[Jacques Vallee]]'s book ''Passport to Magonia'', which explores the link between modern UFO visitations and reports from antiquity of contact with these "space beings" where he quotes Agobard's description.

[[Maria Dahvana Headley]]'s young adult novel ''Magonia'' also references the mythological realm.

The '''neck''', '''nicor''', '''nixie''' or '''nokken''' ({{lang-de|[[wikt:Nixe|Nixe]]}}; {{lang-nl|[[wikt:nikker|nikker]]}}, {{lang|nl|[[wikt:nekker|nekker]]}}; [[Danish language|Danish]]: ''nøkke;'' {{lang-no|[[wikt:nøkk|nøkk]]}}; {{lang-sv|[[wikt:näck|näck]]}}; {{lang-fi|[[wikt:näkki|näkki]]}}; {{lang-et|[[wikt:näkk|näkk]]}}) are [[shapeshifting]] water spirits in [[Germanic mythology]] and [[Germanic folklore|folklore]] who usually appeared in forms of other creatures.

Under a [[#Names|variety of names]], they were common to the stories of all [[Germanic peoples]],&lt;ref name="nordisknäck"&gt;The article ''Näcken'', [http://runeberg.org/nfbt/0177.html tome 20, p. 317], in {{lang|no|[[Nordisk familjebok]]}} (1914)&lt;/ref&gt; although they are perhaps best known from [[Scandinavian folklore]]. The related English ''[[knucker]]'' was generally depicted as a [[European dragon|wyrm]] or [[European dragon|dragon]], although more recent versions depict the spirits in other forms. Their sex, bynames, and various transformations vary geographically. The German '''{{lang|de|Nix}}''' and his Scandinavian counterparts were males. The German {{lang|de|Nixe}} was a female river [[mermaid]].&lt;ref name="nordisknäck"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Names|Etymology}}Names and etymology==
[[File:Kittelsen - Nøkken (Nasjonalmuseet)2.jpg|thumb|In Norway, [[Theodor Kittelsen]]'s {{lang|no|Nøkken}} from 1904 is equally famous.]]
The names are held to derive from [[Proto-Germanic|Common Germanic]] ''*nikwus'' or ''*nikwis(i)'', derived from [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''{{PIE|*neig&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;}}'' ("to wash").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koeblergerhard.de/germanistischewoerterbuecher/indogermanischeswoerterbuch/idgN.pdf |last=Köbler |first=Gerhard |title=Indogermanisches Wörterbuch |format=PDF |accessdate=26 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112220846/http://www.koeblergerhard.de/germanistischewoerterbuecher/indogermanischeswoerterbuch/idgN.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are related to [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa-Latn|nḗnēkti}}, Greek {{lang|grc|νίζω }} {{lang|grc-Latn|nízō}} and {{lang|grc|νίπτω }} {{lang|grc-Latn|níptō}}, and [[Irish language|Irish]] {{lang|ga|nigh}} (all meaning to wash or be washed).&lt;ref name="hellquist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://runeberg.org/svetym/0620.html |title=Svensk etymologisk ordbok |first1=Elof |last1=Hellquist |year=1922 |location=Lund |publisher=C. W. K. Gleerups förlag Berlingska boktryckeriet |page=532 |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form ''neck'' appears in English and Swedish ({{lang|sv|näck}} or {{lang|sv|nek}}, meaning "nude").&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; The Swedish form is derived from Old Swedish {{lang|non|neker}}, which corresponds to Old Icelandic {{lang|non|nykr}} ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}} {{lang|non|nykrs}}), and {{lang|nn|nykk}} in [[Nynorsk|Norwegian Nynorsk]].&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; In Finnish, the word is {{lang|fi|[[näkki]]}}. In Old Danish, the form was {{lang|non|nikke}} and in modern Danish and Norwegian [[Bokmål]] it is {{lang|da|nøkk}}.&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; The Icelandic and Faroese {{lang|is|nykur}} are horselike creatures. In [[Middle Low German]], it was called {{lang|gml|necker}} and in [[Middle Dutch]] {{lang|dum|nicker}} (compare also {{lang|gmh|Nickel}} or {{lang|gmh|Nikkel}} plus {{lang|gmh|Kobolt}}) .&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; The [[Old High German]] form {{lang|goh|nihhus}} also meant "crocodile",&lt;ref name="nordisknäck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; while the [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|nicor}}&lt;ref name="nordisknäck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; could mean both a "water monster" like those encountered by [[Beowulf]],&lt;ref name="Kemble1837"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kemble |first=John Mitchell |title=Beowulf: A Translation of the Anglo-Saxon Poem of Beowulf |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqIYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR17 |year=1837 |pages=17– }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "hippopotamus".&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; The Norwegian {{lang|no|[[Fossegrim]]}} and Swedish {{lang|sv|Strömkarlen}} are related figures sometimes seen as by-names for the same creature.&lt;ref name="hellquist"/&gt; The southern Scandinavian version can transform himself into a horse-like ''[[kelpie]]'', and is called a {{lang|sv|Bäckahästen}} (the "brook horse"), whilst the Welsh version is called the {{lang|cy|[[Ceffyl Dŵr]]}} (the "water horse").

==England==
English folklore contains many creatures with similar characteristics to the ''Nix'' or {{lang|sv|Näck}}. These include [[Jenny Greenteeth]], the [[Shellycoat]], the river-hag [[Peg Powler]], the {{lang|sv|Bäckahäst}}-like [[Brag (folklore)|Brag]], and the [[Grindylow]].

At [[Lyminster]] near Arundel in the English county of [[Sussex]], there are today said to dwell "water-wyrms" called [[knucker]]s, in a pool called the ''Knucker-hole''. The great Victorian authority Skeat had plausibly suggested the pool's name of ''knucker'' (a name attested from 1835, Horsfield)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Walker Horsfield, ''The History, Antiquities, and Topography of the County of Sussex'', Volume 2, 1835.&lt;/ref&gt; was likely derived from the [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|nicor}}, a creature-name found in ''Beowulf''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.prestel.co.uk/aspen/sussex/dragon.html Dragons &amp; Serpents In Sussex] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144710/http://www2.prestel.co.uk/aspen/sussex/dragon.html |date=5 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet the waters at the pool were badly muddied by a local antiquarian named Samuel Evershed, who from 1866 tried assiduously to connect the pool with dragons and thus with the tale of [[St. George and the Dragon]]. Any authentic water-sprite folklore the site may originally have had was thus trampled down by Evershed's enthusiastic inculcation of the local people in ideas about water-dragons.

===Näck, Nøkk===
[[File:Näckens polska.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Näckens polska'' by [[Bror Hjorth]]]]
The Scandinavian ''näcken'', ''näkki'', ''nøkk'' were male water spirits who played enchanted songs on the violin, luring women and children to [[drown]] in lakes or streams.  However, not all of these spirits were necessarily malevolent; many stories indicate at the very least that nøkker were entirely harmless to their audience and attracted not only women and children, but men as well with their sweet songs.  Stories also exist wherein the Fossegrim agreed to live with a human who had fallen in love with him, but many of these stories ended with the nøkk returning to his home, usually a nearby waterfall or brook. (Compare the legend of [[Llyn y Fan Fach]] in Wales.) The nøkker were said to grow despondent unless they had free, regular contact with a water source.

The Norwegian [[Fossegrim]] or ''Grim'', Swedish ''strömkarl'',&lt;ref&gt;Or strömkarl (singular), per Grimm 1835:17:11.&lt;/ref&gt; is a related figure who, if properly approached, will teach a musician to play so adeptly "that the trees dance and waterfalls stop at his music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm056.htm |title=The Fairy Mythology: Scandinavia : The Power of the Harp |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to describe the appearance of the nix, as one of his central attributes was thought to be [[shapeshifting]]. Perhaps he did not have any true shape. He could show himself as a man playing the violin in brooks and waterfalls (though often imagined as fair and naked today, in folklore he was more frequently described as wearing more or less elegant clothing) but also could appear to be treasure or various floating objects, or as an animal—most commonly in the form of a "brook horse" (see below). The modern Scandinavian names are derived from [[Old Norse]] ''nykr'', meaning "river horse". Thus, it is likely that the figure of the brook horse preceded the personification of the nix as the "man in the rapids".  Fossegrim and derivatives were almost always portrayed as especially beautiful young men, whose clothing (or lack thereof) varied widely from story to story.

The enthralling music of the nøkk was most dangerous to women and children, especially pregnant women and [[baptism|unbaptised]] children.  He was thought to be most active during [[Midsummer's Night]], on Christmas Eve, and on Thursdays.  However, these superstitions do not necessarily relate to all the versions listed here. Many,  if not all of them, developed after the Christianizing of the northern countries, as was the case of similar stories of faeries and other entities in other areas.

[[File:Ernst Josephson-Näcken.jpg|thumb|upright|''Näcken'' ("The Water Sprite") by [[Ernst Josephson]], 1884]]

When malicious nøkker attempted to carry off people, they could be defeated by calling their name; this was believed to cause their death.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 95-6, Dover Publications, New York 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another belief was that if a person bought the nøkk a treat of three drops of blood, a black animal, some "brännvin" (Scandinavian [[vodka]]) or [[snus]] (wet snuff) dropped into the water, he would teach his enchanting form of music.

The nøkk was also an omen for drowning accidents. He would scream at a particular spot in a lake or river, in a way reminiscent of the [[loon]], and on that spot, a fatality would later take place. He was also said to cause drownings, but swimmers could protect themselves against such a fate by throwing a bit of steel into the water.&lt;ref name="phantoms" /&gt;

In the later Romantic folklore and folklore-inspired stories of the 19th century, the nøkk sings about his loneliness and his longing for salvation, which he purportedly never shall receive, as he is not "a child of God". In a poem by Swedish poet [[Erik Johan Stagnelius|E. J. Stagnelius]], a little boy pities the fate of the nøkk, and so saves his own life. In the poem, arguably Stagnelius' most famous, the boy says that the Näck (nøkk) will never be a "child of God" which brings "tears to his face" as he "never plays again in the silvery brook". 

On a similar theme, a 19th-century text called "Brother Fabian's Manuscript" by [[Sebastian Evans]] has this verse:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Where by the marishes boometh the [[bittern]],
Neckar the soulless one sits with his ghittern.
Sits inconsolable, friendless and foeless.
Waiting his destiny, - Neckar the soulless.&lt;ref name="phantoms"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924079619411/cu31924079619411_djvu.txt |title=Phantoms of the Deep, or : Legends and Superstitions of the Sea and of Sailors |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

(The source has "bloometh" for "boometh", but this is clearly an error; a bittern is not a plant, but a bird, and it is known for its booming call. A "ghittern" is a guitar. The spelling "Nickar" ''vice'' "Neckar" is sometimes used.)

In Scandinavia, [[Nymphaea alba|water lilies]] are called "nix roses" (''näckrosor/nøkkeroser''). A tale from the forest of [[Tiveden]] relates that a father promised his daughter to a nøkken who offered him great hauls of fish in a time of need; she refused and stabbed herself to death, staining the water lilies red from that time on:
{{quote|At the lake of Fagertärn, there was once a poor fisherman who had a beautiful daughter. The small lake gave little fish and the fisherman had difficulties providing for his little family. One day, as the fisherman was fishing in his little [[Dugout (boat)|dugout]] of oak, he met the Nøkken, who offered him great catches of fish on the condition that the fisherman gave him his beautiful daughter the day she was eighteen years old. The desperate fisherman agreed and promised the Nøkken his daughter. The day the girl was eighteen she went down to the shore to meet the Nøkken. The Nøkken gladly asked her to walk down to his watery abode, but the girl took forth a knife and said that he would never have her alive, then stuck the knife into her heart and fell down into the lake, dead. Then, her blood coloured the water lilies red, and from that day the water lilies of some of the lake's forests are red (Karlsson 1970:86).}}

===Bäckahäst, bækhest===
[[File:Theodor Kittelsen - Nøkken som hvit hest.jpg|thumb|The Neck as a brook horse by Theodor Kittelsen, a depiction of the Neck as a white horse]]
[[File:Gutt på hvit hest.jpg|thumb|''Gutt på hvit hest'' (Boy on white horse) by the same Kittelsen]]
[[File:Arthur Rackam Die Rheintöchter.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Rhinemaidens]] by [[Arthur Rackham]]]]

The '''bäckahäst''' or '''bækhest''' (translated as ''the brook horse'') is a [[mythology|mythological]] horse in [[Scandinavian folklore]]. It has a close parallel in the Scottish [[kelpie]], and the Welsh [[Ceffyl Dŵr]].

It was often described as a majestic white horse that would appear near rivers, particularly during foggy weather.  Anyone who climbed onto its back would not be able to get off again.  The horse would then jump into the river, drowning the rider. The brook horse could also be harnessed and made to plough, either because it was trying to trick a person or because the person had tricked the horse into it. The following tale is a good illustration of the brook horse:
{{quote|A long time ago, there was a girl who was not only pretty but also big and strong. She worked as a maid on a farm by Lake Hjärtasjön in southern [[Nerike]]. She was ploughing with the farm's horse on one of the fields by the lake. It was springtime and beautiful weather. The birds chirped and the [[white wagtail|wagtail]]s flitted in the tracks of the girl and the horse in order to pick worms. All of a sudden, a horse appeared out of the lake. It was big and beautiful, bright in colour and with large spots on the sides. The horse had a beautiful mane which fluttered in the wind and a tail that trailed on the ground. The horse pranced for the girl to show her how beautiful he was. The girl, however, knew that it was the brook horse and ignored it. Then the brook horse came closer and closer and finally he was so close that he could bite the farm horse in the mane. The girl hit the brook horse with the bridle and cried: "Disappear you scoundrel, or you'll have to plough so you'll never forget it." As soon as she had said this, the brook horse had changed places with the farm horse, and the brook horse started ploughing the field with such speed that soil and stones whirled in its wake, and the girl hung like a mitten from the plough. Faster than the cock crows seven times, the ploughing was finished and the brook horse headed for the lake, dragging both the plough and the girl. But the girl had a piece of [[Iron in mythology|steel]] in her pocket, and she made the [[sign of the cross]].  Immediately she fell down on the ground, and she saw the brook horse disappear into the lake with the plough. She heard a frustrated neighing when the brook horse understood that his trick had failed. Until this day, a deep track can be seen in the field. (Hellström 1985:16)}}

==Germany==
The German ''Nix'' and ''Nixe'' (and ''Nixie'') are types of river [[merman]] and [[mermaid]] who may lure men to drown, like the Scandinavian type, akin to the Celtic [[Melusine]] and similar to the Greek [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]. The German epic ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' mentions the Nix in connection with the [[Danube]], as early as 1180 to 1210.

Nixes in folklore became [[Sprite (creature)|water sprites]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Grimm 1835:17:11.&lt;/ref&gt; who try to lure people into the water. The males can assume many different shapes, including that of a human, fish, and snake. The females bear the tail of a fish. When they are in human forms, they can be recognised by the wet hem of their clothes. The Nixes are portrayed as malicious in some stories but harmless and friendly in others.

By the 19th century [[Jacob Grimm]] mentions the Nixie to be among the "[[Sprite (creature)|water-sprites]]" who love music, song and dancing, and says "Like the sirens, the Nixie by her song draws listening youth to herself, and then into the deep."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; According to Grimm, they can appear human but have the barest hint of animal features: the nix had "a slit ear", and the Nixie "a wet skirt". Grimm thinks these could symbolise they are "higher beings" who could [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] to animal form.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm 1835:33:2.&lt;/ref&gt;

One famous Nixe of recent [[German folklore]], deriving from 19th-century literature, was [[Lorelei]]; according to the legend, she sat on the rock at the [[Rhine]] which now bears her name, and lured fishermen and boatmen to the dangers of the reefs with the sound of her voice. In Switzerland there is a legend (myth) of a sea-maid or Nixe that lived in [[Lake Zug]] (the lake is in the Canton of Zug).

''[[The Yellow Fairy Book]]'' by [[Andrew Lang]] includes a story called "[[The Nixie of the Mill-Pond]]" in which a malevolent spirit that lives in a mill pond strikes a deal with the miller that she will restore his wealth in exchange for his son. This story is taken from the Tales of Grimm.

The legend of [[Heer Halewijn]], a dangerous lord who lures women to their deaths with a magic song, may have originated with the Nix.

{{See also|Lorelei}}
{{See also|Wagner's Rhinemaidens}}
Alternate names (kennings) for the female German Nixe are Rhine maidens ({{lang-de|link=no|Rheintöchter}}) and [[Lorelei]].

In a fictional depiction, the '''Rhine maidens''' are among the [[protagonist]]s in the four-part Opera ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' by the composer [[Richard Wagner]], based loosely on the nix of the ''Nibelungenlied''.

The Rhine maidens [[Wellgunde]], [[Woglinde]], and [[Floßhilde]] ([[Flosshilde]]) belong to a group of characters living in a part of nature free from human influence.  [[Jörð|Erda]] and the [[Norns]] are also considered a part of this 'hidden' world.

They are first seen in the first work of the Nibelungen cycle, ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', as guardians of the ''Rheingold'', a treasure of gold hidden in the [[Rhine|Rhein]] river.  The dwarf [[Alberich]], a [[Nibelung]], is eager to win their favour, but they somewhat cruelly dismiss his flattery.  They tell him that only one who is unable to love can win the ''Rheingold''.  Thus, Alberich curses love and steals the ''Rheingold''.  From the stolen gold he forges a [[Ring (jewellery)|ring]] of power. Further on in the cycle, the Rhine maidens are seen trying to regain the ring and transform it back into the harmless ''Rheingold''. But no one will return the ring to them; not even the supreme god [[Odin|Wotan]], who uses the ring to pay the giants Fasolt and Fafner for building [[Valhalla]], nor the hero [[Sigurd|Siegfried]], when the maidens appear to him in the third act of ''[[Götterdämmerung]]''. Eventually [[Brynhildr|Brünnhilde]] returns it to them at the end of the cycle, when the fires of her funeral pyre cleanse the ring of its curse.

Descendants of German immigrants to Pennsylvania sometimes refer to a mischievous child as being "nixie".

'''''Phantasm''''' is a 1979 American [[horror film]] directed, written, photographed, and edited by [[Don Coscarelli]]. The first film in the [[Phantasm (franchise)|''Phantasm'' franchise]], it introduces the [[Tall Man (Phantasm)|Tall Man]] ([[Angus Scrimm]]), a supernatural and malevolent [[undertaker]] who turns the dead of earth into dwarf [[zombies]] to be sent to his planet and used as slaves.  He is opposed by a young boy, Mike ([[A. Michael Baldwin|Michael Baldwin]]), who tries to convince his older brother Jody (Bill Thornbury) and family friend Reggie ([[Reggie Bannister]]) of the threat.

''Phantasm'' was a locally financed [[independent film]]; the cast and crew were mostly amateurs and aspiring professionals.  Though initial reviews were mixed in regards to the dream-like, surreal narrative and imagery, later reception was more positive and the film became a [[cult classic]].  It has appeared on several critics' lists of best horror films, and it has been cited as an influence on later horror series. It was followed by four sequels: ''[[Phantasm II]]'' (1988), ''[[Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead]]'' (1994), ''[[Phantasm IV: Oblivion]]'' (1998) and ''[[Phantasm: Ravager]]'' (2016).

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=July 2018}}
Tommy (Bill Cone) and the Lady In Lavender (Kathy Lester) have sex in Morningside Cemetery, after which the woman kills Tommy with a knife. Later, Tommy's friends, including 24-year-old musician Jody Pearson and family man Reggie, attend Tommy's funeral at Morningside, believing he committed suicide. Jody explains that he didn't bring his 13-year-old brother, Mike, because their parents died recently and he felt Mike would be traumatised by another funeral. However, Mike has been secretly observing the funeral from the bushes; after the mourners leave, Mike witnesses a tall man in a suit who seems to be the Morningside mortician lift Tommy's 500-pound casket with superhuman strength and load it into his hearse instead of completing the burial. He also seems to telekinetically knock Mike off his motorbike as he flees the cemetery.

Mike relays this story to a fortune teller (Mary Ellen Shaw) and her granddaughter (Terrie Kalbus), as well as his fears about the possibility of Jody departing and leaving him in the care of his aunt. Through her granddaughter, the fortune teller tells Mike not to worry about Jody, assuring him that Jody would take Mike along if he chose to leave town. Then, she seems to magically produce a small black box and instructs Mike to put his hand into it. After the box grips his hand, Mike is told not to be afraid, and as the panic subsides, the box relaxes its grip. After Mike leaves, the fortune teller's granddaughter investigates the Morningside mausoleum, where she finds a strange room filled with white light. She screams at what she sees, and is presumably killed. Later, the Lady in Lavender seduces Jody in a bar and takes him to Morningside Cemetery to have sex. Mike, who has taken to secretly following Jody in the wake of their parents' deaths, has an aggressive encounter with a short, hooded figure while spying on his brother. He runs screaming from the bushes, interrupting Jody mid-coitus. When Jody catches up to him, Mike frantically tries to tell him about the hooded figure, but Jody dismisses the story.  

After another violent encounter with more hooded figures and seeing the Tall Man walk down the street and react strangely to cold air coming out of Reggie's ice cream truck, Mike resolves to investigate Morningside and obtain proof of his suspicions to show to Jody. While exploring the mausoleum, a silver sphere flies through the air, narrowly missing Mike as he dives under it. He is accosted by a Morningside caretaker, but Mike escapes just as the sphere is making another pass; it impales itself in the caretaker's skull and drills into his brain, killing him. The Tall Man approaches Mike, but he escapes by exercising control over his fear, surprising the Tall Man and trapping his hand in a heavy door. Mike cuts the fingers off of the hand, causing the Tall Man to bellow an alien roar while yellow blood gushes from the wound. Mike takes one of the Tall Man's still-moving fingers and escapes the mausoleum, narrowly avoiding capture by the hooded figures. 

The finger is enough for Jody to believe Mike's stories about Morningside. Meanwhile, the finger transforms into a vicious, oversized fly-like insect that attacks Mike. Reggie coincidentally witnesses this, and joins the brothers in their suspicions about Morningside. Jody decides to go on his own investigation alone. He is chased away from Morningside by a seemingly driverless hearse, but is rescued by Mike in Jody's [[Plymouth Barracuda]]. The two run the hearse off the road and discover it was driven by one of the hooded figures, whom they discover to be a re-animated Tommy. Tommy's body has been unnaturally shortened, although he weighs significantly more than average. Reggie and Jody resolve to defeat the Tall Man. Mike is taken to an antique store owned by Jody's friend Sally (Lynn Eastman). There, Mike discovers an antique photograph of the Tall Man. Mike begs Sally to take him home; on the way they see Reggie's ice cream truck overturned. Mike finds a handprint melted into a block of ice with the same yellow blood that came out of the Tall Man. Mike tries to get Sally and her friend to leave the scene quickly, but all three are attacked by a mob of hooded dwarves. Mike survives by being thrown out of the back window, while the girls drive off into the night, screaming. Mike assumes they and Reggie are all dead. 

Jody locks Mike in his room to keep him safe, then goes to Morningside to execute his plan to kill the Tall Man. Mike escapes his bedroom and tries to leave to help Jody, but the Tall Man is waiting for him outside his front door. He kidnaps Mike in a hearse, but Mike thwarts him by shooting out the back window and a rear tire, causing the hearse to strike a pole and explode. While looking for Jody in Morningside, Mike opens his father's casket and sees that it is empty, prompting him to scream and attract the attention of the silver sphere. Jody destroys it with a shotgun. Suddenly, Reggie appears and explains that he rescued Sally and several other girls. The three then open the mysterious door the fortune teller's daughter opened earlier. Inside, they find oil drum-like canisters with more dwarfed re-animated corpses inside them. Mike accidentally falls through a portal and catches a brief glimpse of a red, hot planet where the dwarves are toiling as slaves. He is quickly snatched back to Earth by Jody, after which he deduces that the Tall Man must come from the red planet and that the corpses are shortened so they can withstand the increased gravity and temperatures. 

The trio is suddenly split up by a power outage. Reggie remains in the dwarf storage room alone, and places his hands on the portal, mirroring an earlier scene when he stopped a tuning fork from vibrating. This causes the portal to become a powerful vacuum that Reggie narrowly escapes. It also stuns the Lady in Lavender, revealed to be a shape-shifted Tall Man, and saves Jody from being stabbed. However, in the chaos, Reggie stumbles upon the Lady in Lavender's body, and she kills him. Jody and Mike flee, and the mausoleum vanishes. The brothers devise a plan to lure the Tall Man into a local deserted mine shaft and trap him inside. Mike once again controls his fear and succeeds in the plan, after which he suddenly wakes up in his bed. Reggie, still alive, tells Mike that much of what he experienced was a nightmare, which has been happening frequently since Jody died in a car crash. Mike appears to remember this and believe it. Reggie tells Mike that he will take care of him as Jody did, and that they should go on a road trip together. When Mike enters his bedroom to pack, he is shocked to see the Tall Man is waiting for him. Hands crash through the glass of his bedroom mirror, pulling Mike into a dark void.

==Cast==
* [[Angus Scrimm]] as [[Tall Man (Phantasm)|The Tall Man]]:
: After being intimidated by Scrimm on the set of a previous film, Coscarelli decided that Scrimm would make a great villain.&lt;ref name=sphere&gt;{{cite news|last=Savlov|first=Marc|title=Sphere of Influence|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2000-03-31/76665/|accessdate=August 9, 2013|newspaper=[[Austin Chronicle]]|date=March 31, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, Scrimm had little input into the character, but he made more of a contribution as Coscarelli began to trust his instincts.  Scrimm was outfitted in lifts and a suit too small for him in order to make him seem even taller and skinnier.  Coscarelli says of Scrimm, "I really didn't have any idea that he would take it to the level that he did. ... I could see it was going to be a very powerful character."&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;
* [[A. Michael Baldwin]] as Mike Pearson:
: After the deaths of his parents, Mike tries to convince his brother and Reggie that a local mortician called the Tall Man is responsible for their deaths.  Coscarelli attributes the enduring popularity of the film to young audiences who respond to Mike's adventures.&lt;ref name=birthday&gt;{{cite news|title=Happy Birthday, Tall Man!

==Analysis==
Film scholar [[John Kenneth Muir]] interprets the film as being about mourning and death.{{sfn|Muir|2002|pages=611–613}} Many of the film's fans are young boys, aged 10–13. According to Angus Scrimm, the film "gives expression to all their insecurities and fears".  Scrimm states that the theme of loss and how, by fantasizing about death, the young protagonist deals with the deaths in his family drives the story.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;  Coscarelli identifies it as a "predominately male story" that young teens respond to.&lt;ref name=sphere/&gt;  Scrimm explains the popularity of the film as fans responding to themes of death,&lt;ref name=sphere/&gt; and the Tall Man himself represents death.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;  Muir describes the Tall Man as embodying childhood fears of adults and states that the Tall Man wins in the end because dreams are the only place where death can be defeated.{{sfn|Muir|2002|pages=611–613}}  American views of death are another theme:
{{quote|I had a compunction to try to do something in the horror genre and I started thinking about how our culture handles death; it’s different than in other societies. We have this central figure of a mortician. He dresses in dark clothing, he lurks behind doors, they do procedures on the bodies we don't know about. The whole embalming thing, if you ever do any research on it, is pretty freaky. It all culminates in this grand funerary service production. It's strange stuff. It just seemed like it would be a great area in which to make a film.|Don Coscarelli|''Los Angeles Times'' interview&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;}}

Dreams and surrealism are also an important part of ''Phantasm''.  Marc Savlov of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' compares ''Phantasm'' to the works of [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] and [[Luis Buñuel]] in terms of weirdness.  Savlov describes the film as existentialist horror and "a truly bizarre mix of outlandish horror, cheapo gore, and psychological mindgames that purposefully blur the line between waking and dreaming."&lt;ref name=sphere/&gt;  Gina McIntyre of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' describes the film as surreal, creepy, and idiosyncratic.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;  Muir writes that ''Phantasm'' "purposely inhabits the half-understood sphere of dreams" and takes place in the imagination of a disturbed boy.{{sfn|Muir|2002|pages=611–613}}

==Production==
===Development===
After seeing the audience reaction to jump scares in ''[[Kenny and Company]]'', writer-director Don Coscarelli decided to do a horror film as his next project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yapp|first=Nate|title=Reggie Bannister ("Phantasm") Interview|url=http://classic-horror.com/newsreel/reggie_bannister_phantasm_interview|work=Classic-Horror.com|accessdate=August 10, 2013|date=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His previous films had not performed well, and he heard that horror films were always successful; branching into horror allowed him to combine his childhood love of the genre with better business prospects.&lt;ref name=fortean&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sutton|first=David|title=Don Coscarelli|journal=[[Fortean Times]]|year=2006|url=http://www.forteantimes.com/features/interviews/116/don_coscarelli.html|accessdate=August 11, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105114832/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/interviews/116/don_coscarelli.html|archivedate=November 5, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original idea was inspired by ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'' by [[Ray Bradbury]].  Coscarelli had initially sought to adapt the story to film, but the license had already been sold.&lt;ref name=fearnet&gt;{{cite web|last=McCabe|first=Joseph|title=Don Coscarelli Talks Phantasm and Bubba|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/review/don-coscarelli-talks-phantasm-and-bubba|work=[[Fearnet]]|accessdate=August 10, 2013|date=April 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of a young boy's difficulty convincing adults of his fears was influenced by ''[[Invaders from Mars (1953 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' (1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Piepenburg|first=Erik|title=Just So You Know: ‘John Dies at the End’|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/just-so-you-know-john-dies-at-the-end/?_r=0|accessdate=August 11, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dario Argento]]'s ''[[Suspiria]]'' (1977) and its lack of explanations was another influence on Coscarelli.&lt;ref name=fortean/&gt;  The soundtrack was influenced by [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]] and [[Mike Oldfield]].  The synthesizers were so primitive that it was difficult to repeat sounds.&lt;ref name=ign&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilchrist|first=Todd|title=Exclusive Interview: Don Coscarelli|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/04/10/exclusive-interview-don-coscarelli|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=August 11, 2013|date=April 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When writing the film's conclusion, Coscarelli intentionally wanted to shock audiences and "send people out of the theater with a bang."&lt;ref name=ten&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1982&amp;dat=19840226&amp;id=jYpGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ei4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1573,2637606|title='Cult' films Spell Success for Movie-Maker|last=Duvoli|first=John|work=The Evening News|location=Newburgh, New York|date=February 26, 1984|accessdate=March 5, 2014|via=Google News}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
There were no accountants on the set, but Coscarelli estimates the budget at $300,000.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;  Funding for the film came in part from Coscarelli's father,&lt;ref name=fangoria&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pace|first=Dave|title=Q&amp;A: Don Coscarelli on "JOHN DIES" &amp; Independent Filmmaking for 30+ Years|journal=[[Fangoria]]|date=April 11, 2013|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/qa-don-coscarelli-on-john-dies-independent-filmmaking-for-30-years/|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was credited as the film's producer;&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; additional funding came from doctors and lawyers.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt; His mother designed some of the special effects,&lt;ref name=fangoria/&gt; costumes, and make-up.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;  The cast and crew were composed mainly of friends and aspiring professionals.  Due to their inexperience, they did not realize that firing blanks could be dangerous; Coscarelli's jacket caught fire from a shotgun blank.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt; Casting was based on previous films that Coscarelli directed, and he created roles for those actors.&lt;ref name=fearnet/&gt;  Because he could not afford to hire an editor or cameraman, Coscarelli did these duties himself.{{sfn|Baldassarre|1999|p=50}}

Filming was done weekends and sometimes lasted for 20 hours over the course of more than a year.&lt;ref name=sphere/&gt; Reggie Bannister described the production as "flying by the seat of our pants." The actors would be called to perform their scenes and picked up as soon as they were available.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;&lt;ref name=icon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconvsicon.com/2009/07/28/30-years-of-phantasm-reggie-bannister-interview-200/|title=30 Years of Phantasm|last=Johnson|first=Steve|work=Icon vs Icon|date=July 28, 2009|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bannister did many of his own stunts.&lt;ref name=icon/&gt;  Though set in [[Oregon]], shooting took place primarily in the San Fernando Valley in [[Chatsworth, California]].&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;  The script changed often during production, and Bannister says that he never saw a completed copy of it; instead, they worked scene-by-scene and used improvisation.&lt;ref name=sphere/&gt;&lt;ref name=icon/&gt;  The script was characterized by Coscarelli as "barely linear".&lt;ref name=fortean/&gt;  While it contained the basic concepts of the completed film, the script was unfocused and rewritten during filming.&lt;ref name=fortean/&gt;  The spheres came from one of Coscarelli's nightmares, but the original idea did not involve drilling.&lt;ref name=sphere/&gt;  Will Greene, an elderly metal-worker, fashioned the iconic spheres, but he never got to see the finished film, as he died before the film was released.&lt;ref name=ten/&gt;  The black 1971 [[Plymouth Barracuda]] was used because Coscarelli had known someone in high school who drove one; he realized that he could get his hands on one by using it in the film.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;

===Post-production===
Post-production took another six to eight months.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;  The first test screening was poorly received due to the film's length; Coscarelli says that he erred in adding too much character development, which needed to be edited out.&lt;ref name=sphere/&gt;  ''Phantasm''{{'}}s fractured dream logic was due in part to the extensive editing.&lt;ref name=ign/&gt;  During shooting, they did not have a clear idea of the ending.&lt;ref name=fortean/&gt;  Several endings were filmed, and one of them was re-used in ''[[Phantasm IV: Oblivion]]''.  Coscarelli attributed the freedom to choose from among these endings to his independent financing.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;

==Release==
To solicit outside opinions, Coscarelli paid an audience to watch an early cut of the film.  Although Coscarelli called the result "a disaster", he was encouraged by the audience's reactions to the film.&lt;ref name=ten/&gt; The financial success of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' released the prior year convinced vice-president of marketing at [[Embassy Pictures|AVCO Embassy Pictures]], Robert Rehme, to purchase ''Phantasm'' for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowell|first1=Richard|title=The Ambitions of Most Independent Filmmakers: Indie Production, the Majors, and Friday the 13th (1980)|journal=Journal of Film and Video|date=2011|volume=63|issue=2|page=32|doi=10.5406/jfilmvideo.63.2.0028|url=https://doi.org/10.5406/jfilmvideo.63.2.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original theatrical release was March 28th, 1979.

In late 2015, Coscarelli showed a work-in-progress [[4K resolution]] restoration of ''Phantasm'' (called ''Phantasm: Remastered'') at the [[Butt-Numb-A-Thon]] film festival.  It was supervised by Coscarelli at [[Bad Robot Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/14/phantasm-jj-abrams-star-wars|title=Phantasm director talks J.J.

J. Abrams]], a fan of the series, requested a screening of the film.

'''''Rienzi vowing to obtain justice for the death of his young brother, slain in a skirmish between the Colonna and the Orsini factions''''' (or simply, '''''Rienzi''''') is a painting by [[William Holman Hunt]], produced in 1849 and currently in a private collection.

==History==
This painting, with its extremely long title, was the first of Hunt's works to include 'PRB' ([[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]) on the canvas.

Hunt took his subject from the 1835 novel ''Rienzi, the Last of the Roman Tribunes'', by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Bulwer Lytton]],&lt;ref&gt;Several of Bulwer-Lytton's novels were made into [[opera]]s, with ''[[Rienzi|Rienzi, der Letzte der Tribunen]]'' being composed by [[Richard Wagner]], and eventually becoming more famous than the novel.&lt;/ref&gt; about [[Cola di Rienzi]] (1313–1354), a papal [[notary]] who led a popular uprising in Rome.  It was exhibited at the 1849 [[Royal Academy]] exhibition (alongside [[John Everett Millais|Millais']] ''[[Isabella (Millais painting)|Lorenzo and Isabella]]'') with the following excerpt from the novel, describing the hero's reaction to the incident:
{{quotation|But for that event, the future liberator of Rome might have been but a dreamer, a scholar, a poet, - the peaceful rival of [[Petrarch]] - a man of thoughts, not deeds. But from that time, all his faculties, energies, fancies, genius, became concentrated to a single point and patriotism, before a vision, leaped into the life and vigour of a passion.''|Rienzi, the Last of the Roman Tribunes, Book I, chap. 1, 23&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by ''The London Literary Gazette'' of 5 December 1835, Vol.19 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=WV0ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false GoogleBook]); see also print ed., Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, ''Rienzi, the Last of the Roman Tribunes'', Adamant Media Corporation (2001). {{ISBN|0-543-87518-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

In 1847, Hunt repeatedly sat up all night to finish [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843);&lt;ref&gt;Composed of five volumes, the second one was influential on the early development of [[Pre-Raphaelitism]]&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Rienzi'' he attempted to put into practice all that he had read. The background particularly was painted in careful detail trying to satisfy Ruskin's stringent requirements. As can be seen from some of Hunt's later work, such as ''[[The Hireling Shepherd]]'' (1851) and ''[[The Awakening Conscience]]'' (1854), the artist often experienced great difficulty with painting his figures in natural poses. This is evident here in the portrayal of the soldier on the far left of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. J. Bronkhurst, ''William Holman Hunt : A Catalogue Raisonné'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3707">'''Rogeting''' is a neologism created to describe the act of modifying a published source by substituting synonyms for sufficient words to fool [[plagiarism detection]] software, often resulting in the creation of new meaningless phrases through extensive synonym swapping. The term, a reference to [[Roget's Thesaurus]], was coined by Chris Sadler, principal lecturer in business information systems at [[Middlesex University]], who discovered the practice in papers submitted by his students.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grove |first1=Jack |title=Sinister buttocks? Roget would blush at the crafty cheek  Middlesex lecturer gets to the bottom of meaningless phrases found while marking essays |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/sinister-buttocks-roget-would-blush-at-the-crafty-cheek/2015027.article |accessdate=15 July 2015 |publisher=[[Times Higher Education]] |date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schuman |first1=Rebecca |title=Cease Rogeting Proximately! |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/education/2014/08/writing_clearly_in_student_papers_the_right_click_thesaurus_and_rogeting.html |accessdate=15 July 2015 |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=14 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SinisterButtocks&gt;{{cite news |title=Rogeting: why 'sinister buttocks' are creeping into students' essays |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/shortcuts/2014/aug/08/rogeting-sinister-buttocks-students-essays-plagiarising-thesaurus |accessdate=15 July 2015 |publisher=The Guardian |date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic form ==
In its basic form, rogeting simply consists of replacing words with their synonyms, chosen from a thesaurus. Several websites can perform this task online for free. A plagiarism checker wouldn't usually be able to detect the original source; however, the main drawback is that the new automatically-generated text might not sound natural or might not make sense at all, thus requiring the intervention of a human operator — who has to be careful not to reuse words that were present in the original source.

== Advanced techniques ==
A similar but much more sophisticated strategy consists in substituting synonyms of single words, or inserting completely different paragraphs, in the internal [[binary code]] of [[computer file]]s containing [[essay]]s, [[theses]], [[review article]]s, [[slide show]]s and so forth, which manage to cheat [[Turnitin.com]] such as cheatturnitin.com as well as any other plagiarism checkers because of the inherent nature of the detection [[algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cheat-turnitins-algorithm-avoid-plagiarism-giuseppe-macario |title=How to cheat Turnitin's flawed algorithm and avoid their plagiarism |date=17 April 2015 |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents produced through this kind of technically-advanced rogeting beat plagiarism checkers but, unlike the simplest form of rogeting, they are visually identical to the original ones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cheatturnitin.com/index.html#last |title=Turnitin Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=20 April 2015 |website=cheatturnitin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the changes are not visible to the [[naked eye]]. Moreover, the whole process can be fully automated and does not require a "second pass" carried out by a human operator, which can bring significant time savings and eliminate the risk of accidentally incrementing the similarity index.&lt;ref&gt;According to originality reports generated by plagiarism checkers such as Turnitin, the higher the similarity index, the greater the amount of plagiarized text in a paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13215">The term “School Brand”, similar to "brand" as it applies to traditional business applications, is any type of term, mark or insignia, which identifies one organization or product from another. These marks were intended to indicate an affiliation with a particular school, group, organization, trade, manufacturer, or maker.

== History ==

While “branding” has history as far back as 1100&amp;nbsp;BCE, in a period referred to as the [[Vedic Period]], “School Branding” however is a relatively new concept. Many universities and colleges, now operate in a businesslike market where students are “customers” and other schools are competition. To successfully compete, a school must develop and market its own brand that differentiates it from the thousands of other schools vying for students and funding. Although most have marketing budgets, schools are still climbing the learning curve when relating to effective branding.

According to Branding Strategy Insider, school branding surfaced in the early 1800s when a few sororities and fraternities literally branded their pledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2006/08/history_of_bran.html/ |title=History of Branding - Brand Strategy Insider |publisher=Brandingstrategyinsider.com |date=2006-08-14 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, tobacco and patent medicine companies began branding their products as a way to identify them and build buyer loyalty. Brand identity also helped protect the customer by holding companies more accountable for product quality. By the mid-1800s, branding became central to business strategy as consumer companies such as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] began using it in their marketing.

Higher education waited over a century to follow the corporate world. According to University Business, schools adopted branding in the early 2000s, when they realized that higher learning had evolved into a marketplace of customers and providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitybusiness.com/article/have-college-brands-delivered-their-promise|title=Have College Brands Delivered on Their Promise?|author=Robert A. Sevier|publisher=UB University Business|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of for-profit and online universities created more choices for students, and those newer schools were aggressively marketing in corporate style. Students were becoming more diverse, and schools could no longer take demographics for granted. At the same time, schools ranging from elementary to colleges and universities, had to compete harder for government funding and private endowments. To meet the challenges, universities invested in market research, logos and other marketing efforts that often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

== Present situation ==

Today’s school branding goes a step further and identifies a school’s unique competitive advantage. As stated in the Gallup Business Journal, a brand promises what the student experience will be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessjournal.gallup.com/content/28081/building-brand-higher-education.aspx/ |title=Building Brand Higher Education - Gallup Business Journal |publisher=Businessjournal.gallup.com |date=2007-07-12 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many school departments produce their own distinctive communications, which can muddy the message. Colleges are grappling with the fact that the message is only effective if the entire faculty and leadership commit as one voice to the brand promise.

Schools also need to communicate their brand in a way that resonates emotionally with students. When people feel a message, they are more likely to remember it and respond. Brandgarten advocates using archetypes in branding to focus the emotional message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandgarten.com/2012/05/07/branding-higher-education|title=Branding Higher Education|publisher=brandgarden|date=May 5, 2012|accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a school that places a high value on community service might use the archetype of the caregiver to tell its story. Prospective students would hear the call to service in all of the college's communications and could decide whether it was a potential match. Prior to branding, the same college would have been lost among superficially similar schools.

One recent rebranding occurred when [[Beaver College]], in Pennsylvania, surveyed prospective students and discovered that 30 percent of people considering the university did not apply because of the name. As a result, Beaver College was rebranded as [[Arcadia University]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunzel|first1=David|title=Universities Sell Their Brands|journal=The Journal of Product and Brand Management|date=2007|volume=16 |issue=2|pages=152-153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition of need ==

[[Harvard University]], viewed as the college gold standard, relies on branding to help recruit students and donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randall |first=Kevin |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1361340/does-branding-pay-colleges-harvard-thinks-so/ |title=Does Branding Pay Off for Colleges? Harvard Thinks So |publisher=Fast Company |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university took a lesson from its own business school and has applied for trademarks to protect several taglines. According to Fast Company, Harvard has already won approval for the taglines "Ask what you can do" and "Lessons learned". Harvard has also taken the entrepreneurial step of licensing its name to an upscale clothing line, which helps with branding as well as its funding mission.

Although colleges may be fairly new to branding, Neuromarketing points out that they represent the longest-lived brands in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fri, Jul 17, 2009 Neuromarketing, Branding |url=http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/college-branding.htm/ |title=College Branding |publisher= Neuromarketing |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools exist for decades and even centuries and today have thousands of rivals. As baby boomers age out of the education market, the declining number of prospective students is increasing competition among schools. Schools have responded with glossy marketing campaigns but still lag in branding. Neuromarketing notes that much college marketing material portrays similar images of a pleasant campus filled with smiling professors and a diverse student body. Websites, brochures and even tours often leave students and their families no wiser as to what makes a particular school special.

The missing ingredient is brand development, as [[Columbia University]] discovered in recent years. According to Neuromarketing, Columbia branded itself as the only Ivy League school in New York City and began showcasing the Manhattan experience in its marketing materials. Student applications have since increased over the competition, and many applicants cited location as the reason they chose Columbia University. Administrators of Columbia University realized that name recognition alone was not enough to attract more of the right students, and its branding strategy paid off.

Even as schools compete for students, those students are learning to brand themselves in an effort to impress colleges. High school is the right time to start building a personal brand, advises Visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vizibility.net/blog/its-never-too-early-personal-branding-for-high-school-college-students/ |title=It’s Never Too Early - Personal Branding for High School &amp; College Students - Visibility |author=Adrian Maynard| publisher=Vizibility.net |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young students can take several steps to enhance their uniqueness, beginning with defining a niche that will serve as the core of their brand. To build the school brand, they can start a quality blog and network both online and offline about its subject. Additional help in for schools in building a brand can be found by extended resources to companies like VIP Branding, who specializes in school branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalvillageconcerns.com/ |title=Specializing in School Branding - VIP Branding |publisher=Globalvillageconcerns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allocation of resources to expert branding companies, allows school administrators to focus their attention to the needs of the school. By the time these students are ready to apply for college, they will have an edge over those who left personal branding up to the admissions essay.

Today’s students shop with brand awareness, and schools need to have a compelling message in place to attract them. Online school stores, like the ones offered through the Varsity Shop Program, provide a new avenue for schools to market themselves and their brand, through specialty designed and branded products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsityshop.com/ |title=Varsity Shop Program |publisher=varsityshop.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although schools tends to be leery of corporate tactics, branding is an opportunity for them to define for themselves what makes them special. By doing so, schools enrich what they offer creating school spirit and student pride, helping students to carry that commitment and care onto higher education.

== Repercussions of improper use ==

While many school administrators, recognize the power of school branding, the lack of resources and funding have led to alternative solutions to professional branding. Logo infringement has increased through the years as a result of this acknowledged need for branding. Numerous schools across the United States are infringing upon trademarked logos without realizing they are in violation. The [[Sanford Herald]] notated a recent case with [[Lake Mary High School]] out of [[Florida]], was in such a case, when the school was given a cease and desist order to terminate the use of their ram logo because as their ram logo was too similar the [[Dodge Ram]] logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mysanfordherald.com/view/full_story_obits/7668253/article-Lake-Mary-rallies-around-new-ram|title=Lake Mary rallies around a new ram|author=Rachel Delinski|publisher=The Sanford Herold|date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, logo infringement is accidental, but the resulting repercussions of using trademarked logos can lead to litigation, exorbitant fines, and can be disparaging on school morale.

In addition to logo infringement, the loss of brand identity is another resulting drawback to improper school branding. Unprofessionally designed logos or mascots, can lead to an undesired identity or a variety of versions, which can lead to brand confusion as notated in by Brand Empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brandempowerment.com/schools/school-challenges/brand-control/ |title=Brand Control |publisher=Brand Empowerment |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stipple engraving''' is a technique used to create tone in an [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] print by distributing a pattern of dots of various sizes and densities across the image. The pattern is created on the printing plate either in [[engraving]] by gouging out the dots with a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], or through an [[etching]] process.&lt;ref name=pankow/&gt; [[Stippling]] was used as an adjunct to conventional [[line engraving]] and etching for over two centuries, before being developed as a distinct technique in the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name=salaman/&gt;

The technique allows for subtle tonal variations and is especially suitable for reproducing chalk drawings.&lt;ref name=verhoogt&gt;{{cite book|title=Art in Reproduction: Nineteenth-Century Prints after Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Jozef Israels and Ary Scheffer|first= Robert|last= Verhoogt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSDnRo7YrWwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Verhoogt,+Art+in+Reproduction&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Xi0NT57ZJOquiQKfntSGBA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=crayon%20manner&amp;f=false|page=77|isbn=978-90-5356-913-9|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Stipple effects were used in conjunction with other engraving techniques by artists as early as [[Giulio Campagnola]] (c.1482 – c. 1515) and [[Ottavio Leoni]] (1578 – 1630), although some of Campagnola's small prints were almost entirely in stipple.&lt;ref&gt;Mark J. Zucker in Kristin L. Spangenberg (ed), ''Six Centuries of Master Prints: Treasures from the Herbert Greer French collection'', Cincinnati Art Museum, 1993, nos 39 &amp; 40, {{ISBN|0-931537-15-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Holland in the seventeenth century, the printmaker and goldsmith [[Jan Lutma]] developed an engraving technique, known as ''opus mallei'', in which the dots are punched into the plate by an awl struck with a hammer, while in England the faces of portraits were engraved with stippled dots by [[William Rogers (engraver)|William Rogers]] in the sixteenth century and [[Lucas Vorsterman]] in the seventeenth.&lt;ref name=salaman&gt;{{cite book|title=The Old Engravers of England in Their Relation to Contemporary Life and Art|first= Malcolm C.|last= Salaman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZh5Bl3_zb8C&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq|pages=204–07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eighteenth century==
[[File:Duchess of Richmond, 1775 stipple engraving.jpg|thumb|''The Duchess of Richmond'', a stipple engraving portrait by [[William Wynne Ryland]] after [[Angelica Kauffman]] (1775)]]

An etched stipple technique known as the '''crayon manner''', suitable for producing imitations of chalk drawings, was pioneered in France.  Gilles Demarteau used in 1756 goldsmith's chasing tools and marking-wheels to shade the lines in a series of ''Trophies'' designed by [[Antoine Watteau]]. [[Jean-Charles François]] who was a partner of Demarteau further developed the technique and used it to engrave the whole plate. François engraved in 1757 three etchings directly on copper in crayon manner.  He then used the technique to etch three plates using different-size needles bound together.  Other people who contributed to this new  engraving technique included Alexis Magny and Jean-Baptiste Delafosse.&lt;ref name=verhoogt/&gt;&lt;ref name=ward&gt;Gerald W. R. Ward, 'The Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art', Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Wynne Ryland]], who had worked with Jean-Charles François,&lt;ref name=salaman/&gt; took the crayon manner to Britain, using it in his contributions to Charles Roger’s publication ''A Collection of Prints in imitation of Drawings'',&lt;ref name=verhoogt/&gt; and developing it further under the name of  "stipple engraving".&lt;ref name=salaman/&gt;

The process of stipple engraving is described in [[Theodore Henry Adolphus Fielding|T.H. Fielding]]'s ''Art of Engraving'' (1841). To begin with an etching ground is laid on the plate. The outline is drawn out in small dots with an etching needle, and the darker areas of the image shaded with a pattern of close dots. As in [[mezzotint]] use was made of ''roulettes'', and a ''mattoir'' to produce large numbers of dots relatively quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, 78&lt;/ref&gt;  Then the plate is bitten with acid, and the etching ground removed. The lighter areas of shade are then laid in with a [[drypoint]] or a stipple graver; Fielding describes the latter as "resembling the common kind, except that the blade bends down instead of up, thereby allowing the engraver greater facility in forming the small holes or dots in the copper". The etched middle and dark tones would also be deepened where appropriate with the graver.&lt;ref name=fielding&gt;{{cite book|last=Fielding|first=T.H.|title=The Art of Engraving|pages=63–64|publisher=Ackerman &amp; Co.|location=London|year=1841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the technique fed a fashion for reproductions of red chalk drawings by artists such as [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  [[Gilles Demarteau]] etched 266 drawings of Boucher in stipple, for printing in an appropriate [[sanguine]]-coloured ink and framing.&lt;ref name=grif&gt;[[Antony Griffiths|Griffiths, Antony]], ''Prints and Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques'', pp 81, British Museum Press (in UK), 2nd ed., 1996 {{ISBN|0-7141-2608-X}}; [[A. Hyatt Mayor|Mayor, Hyatt A.]], ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 587-588, {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These prints so resembled red chalk drawings that they could be framed as little pictures. They could then be hung in the small blank spaces of the elaborately decorated paneling of residences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/94303/rec/1 Alpheus Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints &amp; People: A Social History of Printed Pictures]'', Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), 1 January 1971, p. 589&lt;/ref&gt;

In England the technique was used for "furniture prints" with a similar purpose, and became very popular, though regarded with disdain by producers of the portrait mezzotints that dominated the English portrait print market.  Stipple competed with mezzotint as a tonal method of [[printmaking]], and while it lacked the rich depth of tone of mezzotint, it had the great advantage that far more impressions could be taken from a plate.&lt;ref name=grif/&gt;

During the late eighteenth century, some printmakers, including [[Francesco Bartolozzi]], began to use colour in stipple engraving. Rather than using separate plates for each colour, as in most colour printing processes of the time, such as [[Jacob Christoph Le Blon]]'s three-colour mezzotint method, the different colours were carefully applied with a brush to a single plate for each impression,&lt;ref name=salaman/&gt; a highly skilled operation which soon proved economically unviable.&lt;ref name=pankow&gt;{{cite book|title=Tempting the Palette: a survey of color printing processes|first=David|last= Pankow|publisher=RIT Cary Graphic Arts Press|year=2005 |page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zDi3b3nf3oC&amp;q=yielding+a+single+print#v=snippet&amp;q=yielding%20a%20single%20print&amp;f=false|isbn= 978-1-933360-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method is also known as ''à la poupée'' after the French term for the small cotton pads used for the inking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/clrflimpr-tech.shtm NGA Washington]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5547">[[Image:Dokumentation av hällristningar - frottage.JPG|thumb|150px|right|A '''stone rubbing''' (graphite on paper) for documentation of a [[petroglyph]].]]
'''Stone rubbing''' is the practice of creating an image of surface features of a stone on paper.  The image records features such as natural textures, inscribed patterns or lettering.  By rubbing hard rendering materials over the paper, pigment is deposited over protrusions and on edges; depressions remain unpigmented since the pliable paper moves away from the rendering material.  Common rendering materials include [[Charcoal#Art|charcoal]], [[crayon|wax]], [[Pencil|graphite]] or [[inkstick]]s.  Over time, the practice of stone rubbing can cause permanent damage to cultural monuments due to abrasion.  For an artist, stone rubbings can become an entire body of creative work that is framed and displayed.

==Technique==

The paper that has been used by Chinese scholars to transfer the calligraphy from stones is made from plant fiber. It can be used in two ways to retrieve the calligraphy. One way requires the paper to be dry and then adhered to the stone through a paste made with water and a starch that is made from rice or wheat. The paper is then tamped into the engravings on the stone. The other technique requires the paper to be wet and tamped into the engravings without a paste. &lt;ref name=Perkins&gt;Perkins, Dorothy. “stone rubbings, Chinese.” Encyclopedia of China: The Essential Reference to China, Its History and Culture. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 1998. Ancient and Medieval History Online. Facts On File, Inc. 28 Jan. 2010 &lt;[http://www.fofweb.com/activelink2.asp?ItemID=WE49&amp;iPin=china02225&amp;SingleRecord=True]&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

After doing either of these techniques, an ink, created through grinding an ink stick and adding water one drop at a time to achieve the ideal consistency, is used to retrieve the calligraphy. The ink is stippled on with a cloth filled with the ink. The ink covers the paper without sinking into the engravings. When the paper is peeled off, the calligraphy engravings come out white, while everything else is black from the ink. &lt;ref name=Perkins /&gt;

More commonly, people use butcher paper to create stone rubbings. The butcher paper is usually taped on to the stone or grave, which contains the inscription desired, with either masking or paint tape. Then, usually, charcoal or crayon is rubbed over the stone or grave, leaving the engravings untouched by the crayon. When the butcher paper is removed, the inscriptions should be readable because they are not marked with the crayon.&lt;ref name=Ancestry&gt;“Headstone Art.” Ancestry. July/August 2008: 55. Print. &lt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NDgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=grave+rubbing&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=grave%20rubbing&amp;f=false]&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be helpful to clean the stone beforehand, to ensure optimum results. A soft brush and water is usually what works best to cleanse the stones. One should not use stiff or hard brushes, as they can scratch the stone. Also, one should not use cleaning solutions or mild detergents on the stones, as they can damage the stone. &lt;ref name=MSP&gt;“Cemeteries.” Massachusetts Studies Project. 28 Jan. 2010 &lt;[http://www.msp.umb.edu/LocHistoryTemplates/MSPCemeteries.html]&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

When stone rubbing, one should be careful with stones that are deteriorating, as they can collapse under pressure.&lt;ref name=MSP/&gt;

==Gravestone rubbing==


'''Gravestone rubbing''' also applies this technique to [[gravestone]]s, often as a method of retrieving and conserving information about [[genealogy]]. For a genealogist, a gravestone rubbing may become a permanent record of death when a gravestone is rapidly deteriorating. 

Rubbings are commonly made by visitors to the US [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author = Tamara L. Britton
| title = The Vietnam Veterans Memorial
| publisher = Checkerboard Books
| year = 2004

| isbn = 1-59197-523-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Visitors use pencil and paper to copy the name of a family member or friend who died during the [[Vietnam War]] off of the wall.  The rubbing forms a type of souvenir.

Gravestone rubbing can be used to teach about local history.  The stone’s condition, art, and inscription can tell what was going on in an area at a specific time.  Studying multiple gravestones in one specific area can give even more information about history.&lt;ref name=MSP/&gt;

'''Swedish art''' refers to the visual arts produced in [[Sweden]] or by Swedish artists.  Sweden has existed as country for over 1,000 years, and for times before this, as well as many subsequent periods, Swedish art is usually considered as part of the wider [[Nordic art]] of [[Scandinavia]].  It has, especially since about 1100, been strongly influenced by wider trends in European art.  After World War II, the influence of the United States strengthened substantially. Due to generous art subsidies, contemporary Swedish art has a big production per capita.

Though usually not especially a major centre for art production or exporter of art, Sweden has been relatively successful in keeping its art; in particular, the relatively mild nature of the [[Swedish Reformation]], and the lack of subsequent extensive rebuilding and redecoration of churches, has meant that with other Scandinavian countries, Sweden has unusually rich survivals of medieval church paintings and fittings.  One period when Nordic art exerted a strong influence over the rest of northern Europe was in [[Viking art]], and there are many survivals, both in stone monuments left untouched around the countryside, and objects excavated in modern times.

The Reformation greatly disrupted Swedish artistic traditions, and left the existing body of painters and sculptors without large markets. The requiremnents of the court and aristocracy were mainly for portraits, usually by imported artists, and it was not until the late 17th or 18th centuries that large numbers of Swedes were trained in contemporary styles.  The political success of the [[Vasa dynasty]] led to a considerable revival, expressed in the "Gustavan style", which again had some influence over neighbouring countries.    

Among famous Swedish artists are [[Johan Tobias Sergel]], [[Carl Milles]], [[Anders Zorn]], [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Carl Eldh]]. 
==History==
=== Prehistoric art ===
[[File:Aspberget rock carving Sweden 4.jpg|thumb|Pre-historic petroglyphs in [[Tanum Municipality|Tanum]]]]
When the ice age ended, the Scandinavian peninsula was populated from the south by hunters and gatherers. Art surviving from that period are [[Stone Age]] expressions and is simple and reflects the available material. Only the truly persistent art forms have survived the ravages of time: [[petroglyph]]s, are such an expression. The earliest rock carvings in the form of symbols, characters and images are carved in rock outcrops and boulders. They began to be produced about 7000 BC. Sweden has one of the largest concentrations of petroglyphs with a local center in [[Tanum Municipality]] in [[Bohuslän]] province.
  
During the [[Bronze Age]], a spiral ornamentation was produced in the style that existed in [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="Store_norske"&gt;{{cite web |author=Östby, Leif &amp; Frode Ernst Haverkamp |year=2009 |url=http://www.snl.no/Sverige/kunst |title=Sverige - kunst |publisher= Store norske leksikon}}&lt;/ref&gt; From about 400 AD, the development of the Nordic animal ornamentation, an unusually rich and imaginative style that reached its peak during the 7th century with the so-called Vendel style. Animal ornamentation experienced a renewed flourishing of the [[rune stones]]. Rune stones - some of which are quite illustrative and are therefore called “image blocks” - were added between about  200 AD and 1130 with a flourishing between the period 980-1100. As an art form, the rune stone is specific to the Nordic culture. Sweden leads the way with the highest amount of rune stones with a total of 2,800 inscriptions. Approximately 85% of all the identified blocks have been in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordiska.uu.se/forskn/samnord.htm nordiska.uu.se]&lt;/ref&gt; The stones were originally painted and combined text with ornamentation and stylized characters. They can be divided into seven different styles.&lt;ref&gt;Gräslund, Anne-Sofie (2006). ''Dating the Swedish Viking-Age rune stones on stylistic grounds'', Runes and their secrets: studies in runology. {{ISBN|978-87-635-0627-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first known image-makers in Sweden were, in fact, rune carvers.

Sweden, especially the south of the country, also participated in [[Viking Age art]], along with the rest of Scandinavia.

=== Medieval and Gothic art ===
[[File:Harkeberga 0844.jpg|thumb|left|This painting by [[Albertus Pictor]] can be seen in [[Härkeberga Church]] (c. 1480).]]
With the advent of Christianity came a new iconography, originally established in the churches, particularly in the form of altar screens, crucifixes, and stones. According to the [[Swedish History Museum]], no other country has such a rich and comprehensive collection of medieval liturgical art.&lt;ref name=hmus&gt;{{cite web |url= http://historiska.se/historia/medeltiden/livochsamhalle/kyrkanlivetscentrum/|title= Kyrkan - livets centrum - Historiska|language=Swedish|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 31 January 2007|website= www.historiska.se|publisher= [[Swedish History Museum]]|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity was shown in [[Romanesque art]] products fabrics and gold works. From the 13th century, Gotland was a center for sculptors, such as the anonymous [[Master Majestatis]]. The [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style came to Sweden during the second half of the 13th century. [[Linköping]] Cathedral is mostly conducted in English Gothic style and contains richly decorated sculptures. Several works from this period exhibit a French influence, for example the [[triumphal cross]] from [[Öja Church]], Gotland and St. Erik's statue in [[Roslags-Bro Church]] in Uppland. There are also Gothic monumental paintings on wood in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt;

Visual narratives gained momentum in the churches in central Sweden in the late 15th century by masters such as [[Nils Håkansson]], Master Petrus. Håkansson's student, [[Albertus Pictor|Albert the painter]], however, was to become far more famous for his religious paintings in Uppland. Motives during this period were often religious or mythical. Albert the painter, motivated by a chess playing Grim Reaper in [[Täby Church]], was the inspiration for [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s film ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' almost 600 years later.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Contemporary with Albertus the Painter is the famous sculpture of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] in the [[Storkyrkan|Great Church]] of Stockholm.&lt;ref name=Hillman&gt;Hillman, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; It was made by the German-born painter and sculptor [[Bernt Notke]], one of the late Middle Ages the most important northern European artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.se/kort/berntnotke Nationalencyklopedin: Bernt Notke]&lt;/ref&gt; Notke, who periodically lived in Sweden, was very productive and had great influence with an intense and expressionistic style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/420621/Bernt-Notke Encyklopedia Britannica: Bernt Notke]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance and Baroque art ===
[[File:Vädersolstavlan.jpg|thumb|17th century copy of [[Urban målare|Urban Larsson]]'s ''Vädersoltavlan'', the oldest known image of Stockholm. The painting can be seen in Storkyrkan.]]
The Vasa period of art consisted largely of portraits of princes, which were painted by foreign artists who were active in Sweden. [[Urban målare|Urban Larsson]] with his ''Vädersoltavla'' from 1535, in the Great Church in Stockholm, was an exception. He is one of the few well-known Swedish artists during the Vasa period and the Renaissance era.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

[[File:Georg Stiernhielm, 1598-1672.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl]] painted this portrait of [[Georg Stiernhielm]] (1663)]]
[[File:Gustav III of Sweden 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander Roslin]]'s magnificent portrait of [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] (1777)]]

The pompous, happy and decorative made its entrance in the 17th century Great Power - during the 17th and 18th centuries the first few decades - was a grand time for architecture. A number of castles, mansions and churches built, like the Royal Palace, meant that artists were called from abroad. These foreign artists trained new generations of Swedish artists. More significant art collections were acquired through spoils of war. One famous artist was the court painter [[David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Ehrenstral was also a portraitist and animal painter, and worked with the [[Drottningholm Palace]], together with Johan Sylvius.  [[Erik Dahlbergh]] depicted the superpower era of Sweden in the great work ''[[Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna]]''. Other painters were [[David von Krafft]], [[Michael Dahl]].&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt;

===Rococo and the Gustavian style===
Liberty and the Gustavian period was a major cultural boom in Sweden. At this time, [[Rococo]] was the initial style.{{huh|date=February 2016}} Future portrait paintings made it internationally known in Swedish painting.&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt; During the period, many Swedish artists moved to continental Europe. A representative of the rococo was [[Gustaf Lundberg]]. His technique was long dominant in the Swedish portrait arts, and he is represented at the Louvre and the National Museum and Art Academy. The French painter [[Guillaume Taraval]] was called upon to decorate the Royal Palace. Together with [[Carl Hårleman]] he advocated the new relaxed style. A leading style artist was [[Jean Eric Rehn]], a student of Hårleman, who worked as craftsmen, architect and artist.

[[Alexander Roslin]] took inspiration from France and conducted many highly sensitive portraits of the era's finest personalities. Some of Roslin's portraits are among the most reproduced from the period. Of major importance was also [[Carl Gustaf Pilo]], who became a court painter in Denmark. Pilo was inspired both by Venetian artists and the Dutchman [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]. Pilo returned, however, to Sweden and then painted the great work Gustaf III's coronation in Stockholm Cathedral.&lt;ref name="Store_norske"/&gt;

Other prominent names were [[Johan Pasch]], [[Per Krafft the Elder]], [[Peter Adolf Hall]] and, perhaps most importantly, [[Johan Tobias Sergel]]. Over time, beginning around 1770, Rococo was succeeded in Sweden by the Gustavian period. Swedish neoclassicism is said to have begun around 1785. The Gustavian period was characterized by both French and English influence. 
  
After Gustav III's death, there was a period of stagnation in Swedish art. On the other hand, peasant painting flourished in particular, Dalarna and Hälsingland with painting and [[Dala horse]]s during this time.{{huh|date=February 2016}} Peasantry painting became a major inspiration for the 18th century artist [[Carl Larsson]].  [[Gothicism]] and [[Neoclassicism]] were the styles of art for several decades, including artists like the sculptor [[Bengt Fogelberg]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Fogelberg, who was inspired by the Danish sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], created powerful statues of Nordic gudagestalter and historical figures.

=== Karl Johan style ===
From the mid-19th century and a few decades later, nature paintings dominated the scene, with Marcus Larsson in the lead. Artists that pointed to something new were Egron Lundgren and Carl Fredrik Hill. Hill became one of the foremost Swedish landscape-painters as he had views that reflected his personality and often express despair and darkness. Egron Lundberg developed watercolor art,  as he traveled extensively in Europe and Asia, and painted his findings. Even history painting was done extensively during the period, including artists such as Carl Gustav Hellquist Gustaf and Cederstrom.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Another painter was August Malmström who created historic and romantic nature works and illustrated many fairytales.

=== Romanticism and naturalism ===

From an international perspective Swedish-produced art languished in obscurity until the late 19th century, when a number of Swedish artists gained attention outside of Sweden. Especially the 1880s and the following two decades were periods of greatness in the Swedish art. Perhaps the best artist of them is the painter, sculptor, and printmaker [[Anders Zorn]]. Zorn was an extremely talented oil painter with a very precise but free style.[[File:Midsommardans av Anders Zorn 1897.jpg|thumb|180px|left| [[Anders Zorn]]'s ''Midsummer Dance'', 1897]] Anders Zorn painted landscapes and people and is known for his nude studies of the hillocks from [[Dalarna]].{{huh|date=February 2016}} Zorn was also concerned with depicting peasant life in his home province of Dalarna. Woman artist [[Amalia Lindegren]] also created glorified scenes of the Swedish peasant and folk. Zorn was counted as one of the foremost painters in Europe in the late 19th century and made many portraits of contemporary celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safran-arts.com/42day/art/art4aug/art0822.html#zorn Safran-Arts.com:Anders Leonard Zorn]&lt;/ref&gt; Some famous work is ''Love's Nymph'' (1883), ''A Prime'' (1888), ''Midsummer Dance'' (1897), ''President Grover Cleveland'' (1899) and ''Bathing hills'' (1906). Zorn's art is featured at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and the [[White House]], and his works are among the most valued of all Swedish artists.

Another big name from this generation is [[Carl Larsson]]. Larsson, like Zorn, appeared in Dalarna and is one of the most beloved Swedish artists. Larsson painted primarily in watercolor and his motives were found in daily life: he often portrayed his own family and their home in Sundborn. His style is airy, very light and is characterized by a skillful interplay of surfaces and lines. Larsson created frescoes and wall paintings, like Midvinterblot and several other frescoes in the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm. Larsson became very famous in Germany in connection with an art book, A Home, that was published there. Another painter who achieved great popular popularity was [[Bruno Liljefors]] with very precise paintings of nature and animals in motion. 
[[File:Bergh Richard Nordic Summer Evening.jpg|thumb|200px|right| [[Richard Bergh]]'s ''Nordic Summer Evening'', 1899-1900]]
Two painters with great stylistic ability were [[Eugène Jansson]] and [[Ernst Josephson]]. Jansson's paintings, which took stylistic inspiration from [[van Gogh]], are often simple geometric forms a large, quiet Stockholm Ground and powerful male figures. Josephsson is more varied and known for masterful oil portraits. He became an inspiration for the later modernism. Portrait painting was also developed by Richard Bergh as well as by [[Nils Kreuger]]. A significant development came in 1885 with the artist's group The Opponents, who wanted to renew the Swedish painting and collected many of those names. A few years later, in the 1890s, Bergh and Kreuger founded the Dorset School together with [[Karl Nordström]]. They reacted against the realistic landscape style and were inspired by Paul Gauguin. Especially Nordström was inspired by the French impressionists. A close friend of Nordström was the author and the universal genius of [[August Strindberg]]. Even Strindberg was an important Swedish painter from the period. The rise of women artists, such as [[Eva Bonnier]], and [[Hanna Hirsch-Pauli|Hanna Pauli]], who, among other things, took inspiration from Rembrandt, also becomes prominent in this period.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

=== Modernism and expressionism ===

Modernism began to enter Swedish art with [[Axel Törneman]] and then the Men of 1909, which was a group of young male artists, mainly from the Artist League school. More abstract forms were represented by [[Hilma af Klint]], [[Nils von Dardel]] and [[Gösta Adrian Nilsson]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

The mid-1920s and a couple of decades following were both characterized by surrealism, the [[Halmstad Group]], and of expressionism, which includes Gothenburg Schools realists, Sven Erixson and Bror Hjorth and a rigorous formalist, abstract minimalism of artists such as [[Olle Bærtling]].&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt; Among the sculptors of the period are Carl Eldh and [[Carl Milles]]. Both have had great influence and the latter is perhaps the most famous Swedish sculptor of all time. From the same generation of sculptors came the self-taught wood sculptor and realist people portrayer [[Axel Petersson Döderhultarn]].

After World War II,  Swedish art was something of a boom and a host of artists established themselves. With a new democratic idea that art was founded for everyone in 1947, popular movements promoting art and in the same period also launched a variety of arts organizations across the country. Among the 1930s radicals as painter [[Albin Amelin]] and graphic artist and monumental painter [[Torsten Billman]] the work continued to bring images to the working people. Torsten Billman could also through his literary illustrations reach new groups. In the 1950s expressionists emerged like Torsten Renqvist and more informal painter Rune Jansson and Eddie Figge.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

In the early 1960s, was revitalized by the Swedish graphic artists as Philip von Schantz and Nils G. Stenqvist.&lt;ref name=Hillman/&gt;

The '''Symphony No. 2 in F minor''' was written by [[Richard Strauss]] between 1883 and 1884.  It is sometimes referred to as just '''Symphony in F minor'''. He gave it the [[Opus number]] 12, and it also appears in other catalogues as TrV 126 and Hanstein A.I.2. It is not listed in von Asow's catalog.

The [[symphony]], written for a standard orchestra consisting of 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s in B-flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horn]]s in F, 2 [[trumpet]]s in F and C, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], and strings, was premiered by [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]] conducting the [[New York Philharmonic]] on December 13, 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1976), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The European premiere, with Strauss himself conducting, took place in October 1885 (on the same night he was the soloist in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 24 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 24]], K. 491, with his own cadenza).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1999), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1976), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887 he played it again with the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuh (1982), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; The work has been performed only once at the BBC Proms, in the 1905 season on 1 September at the Queen's Hall with [[Henry Wood]] conducting the New Queens Hall Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/errdgw BBC Proms archive, 1905 Prom 12]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony is in the usual four movements, though the scherzo and slow movement are switched from their usual positions, as in Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]]:

# Allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso, [[F minor]], 2/4
# Scherzo: Presto, [[A-flat major]], 3/4 with Trio in [[C minor]]
# Andante cantabile, [[C major]], 3/8
# Finale: Allegro assai, molto appassionato, F minor switching to [[F major]], [[cut time]]

The first movement is a [[sonata form]] allegro with three themes.  The ways Strauss develops his material in this symphony owes much to Beethoven's middle period music, in particular "the slow movement of the [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Seventh Symphony]] (in the chromatically inflected stepwise descent at mm. 139—43 of the first movement), the development of the ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]'', first movement (repeated tutti pounding of a single dissonance, in movement one, mm. 193—99), and the ''Egmont Overture'', this time in the same key (intensification through repetition of rising motive over dominant harmony, in movement four, mm. 346—49)."&lt;ref&gt;Youmans (2005), p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;  The recapitulation section is unusual because it modulates to [[A-flat major]] for the second subject group rather than staying in tonic or going to the parallel major.

The scherzo was successful and had to be repeated both times Strauss conducted the symphony in Milan in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson (1975), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

A transitional brass motif from the first movement intrudes in the lyricism of the slow movement.

The main theme of the fourth movement is "an agitated low-string melody rising beneath tremolo and sounding very much like [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]]."&lt;ref&gt;Youmans (2005), p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end, about halfway between [[rehearsal letter]]s T and U, Strauss recalls themes from the previous three movements, though the Andante is recalled second and the Scherzo third. Bruckner's [[Symphony No. 3 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 3]], in its 1873 version, also recalls themes from the previous movements in the finale at an analogous point.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Brahms]]'s initial reaction to the piece was two words: "ganz hübsch"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1999), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; ("quite nice"). Later he elaborated his advice, encouraging Strauss to "take a good look at Schubert's dances," to guard against "thematic irrelevances," and that there "is no point in this piling up of many themes which are only contrasted rhythmically on a single triad."&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1976), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Béla Bartók]]'s [[Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)|Concerto for Orchestra]] contains "an interesting resemblance between a canon for trumpets and horns in three pairs a quaver apart in the slow movement and the canon for brass in the first movement,"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1976), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; something which was first noticed by Theodore Bloomfield.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield (1974), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Strauss's musical style moved on from his second symphony, he did occasionally program it later in his life, for example conducting it on 28 February 1899 in Heidelberg, and again on 29 January 1903 with the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Trenner, pages 178 and 233.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November 1935, he also made a radio broadcast with the [[Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (East Berlin)|Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;Trenner, page 566&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss recorded some of his own compositions, but this symphony was not among them and the 1935 radio broadcast recording is currently lost. The few conductors to record this symphony are [[Michael Halasz]], [[Neeme Järvi]], [[Karl Anton Rickenbacher]], [[Hiroshi Wakasugi]] and [[Sebastian Weigle]]. A version for [[piano duet]] has also been recorded.

}}The  '''Producers Council''' ({{lang-en|Producers' association}}), officially known as the '''Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC)''', is a [[Trade union|union]] for [[film]] producers in the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]], based in [[Chennai]]. Formed in 18 July 1979, the group has a charitable trust fund to provide financial support to retired producers, voiced support for film producers and have collectively protested  for socio-political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tfpc.org/history|title=History – Tamil Film Producers Council|website=tfpc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its reported that, per day business loss during the strike was around ₹ 20 crores.

In July 2017, TFPC decided to break the exclusivity of them to work only with employees from [[Film Employees Federation of South India|FEFSI]], so they announced that they will be working with both FEFSI members and non-FEFSI members. Though TFPC has signed exclusivity with FEFSI, FEFSI has not signed any exclusivity with TFPC, hence FEFSI members can work with TFPC producers and also with other languages producers and ad film makers. TFPC's another agenda is, to regulate the excessive travel per-diem and the mandatory clauses to employ minimum a certain number of employees from FEFSI to film any particular scene of a movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/tn-producer-council-vs-fefsi-what-is-happening-and-why-is-it-important-4778370/|title=Tamil Film Producer Council vs FEFSI: What is happening and why is it important?|date=2017-08-02|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/we-wont-give-in-vishal-on-fefsi-strike-actor-invokes-madras-high-court/articleshow/59865384.cms|title=We won't give in, Vishal on FEFSI strike; actor invokes Madras high court - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1796">{{Culture of Bengal}}
'''Tarja''' (তর্জা) is a form of folk poetry contest from [[Bengal]] with a long tradition. Historically it used to be performed in the village gathering around a [[chandimandap]] or altar for village god, [[mela]] and other social events, in streets, and marketplace religious festivals. The themes of the contest are usually taken from [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]] or [[Puranas]] the poets sings his/her part in the form of [[doggerels]] and the other participant has to guess the meaning of it. During the rising [[bhadralok]] population of the [[Bengal renaissance]] many of these clubs as well as jhumur clubs had been destroyed &lt;ref name=History&gt;''Recasting Women:Essays in Colonial History'', Kumkum Sangari et al. , page 157&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of its [[obscene]] content.

An example of a tarja couplet will be like:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Maagi minsheke chit kore fele diye buke diyechhe paa &lt;br&gt;
Aar chokhta kare jhulur jhulur, mukhe neiko raa&lt;ref name=History/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

This literally translates as "the hussy has thrown the bloke flat on his back, with her foot on his chest/ wordless she stands glaring in anger".&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The answer to this puzzle will be the goddess [[Kali]] and the legend connected to her. The answerer to this will also sing out his/her answer in a poem made at that instant of time.

== As an art form==
The music grown out of this poetry contest has a particular flavour in it. It is also highly conntected to the other similar forms like [[jhumur]], [[tappa]] and has contributed to a degree to the music of [[Bengal]].

[[File:Danza aldeanos Rubens lou.jpg|thumb|280px]]
'''''The Dance of the Villagers''''' is a 1635 painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. now in the [[Prado Museum]] in Madrid. It is closely related to ''[[The Village Fête (Rubens)|The Village Fête]]'', of a similar date and on a similar subject. 

After Rubens' death, [[Philip IV of Spain]] sent his ambassador to buy paintings from the artist's estate - he bought this one for 800 florins and the king hang it in his summer dining room in the old [[Royal Alcázar of Madrid]]. It is now in the [[Prado Museum]].

== History ==

During The Faction's formative years, they toured across the UK, played studio theatres across London, and established an open-air season in [[Brockwell Park]]. They were then invited to be an associate ensemble of the [[New Diorama Theatre]]. With the support of their 5-year relationship at The New Diorama, The Faction was able to trial a more permanent model of working in [[repertory theatre]], with a core ensemble.  

Since 2012, The Faction have produced five annual sell-out repertory seasons, engaging with over 26,000 audience members and 4,000 students. In 2016, The Faction partnered with [[Selfridges]] to create an auditorium in their [[Oxford Street]] store for Shakespeare 400 celebrations, where they produced a version of ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' to critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/richard-brownliemarshall/much-ado-about-nothing-at_b_11759604.html|title=''Much Ado About Nothing'' At Selfridges|website=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Faction took their work even further afield later that year, in partnership with the [[British Council]], and the [[American University of Beirut]], producing and co-directing an Arabic premiere production of ''[[King Lear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aub.edu.lb/news/2016/Pages/malik-lear.aspx|title=AUB – 2016 – ''Al-Malik Lear'' adds Lebanese twist to Shakespearean tragedy|website=www.aub.edu.lb|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Shakespeare, The Faction have produced work by other classic writers such Cervantes, Euripedes, Gorky, Lorca and Schiller. They also bridge the divide between classics and new writing by engaging some of the UK's most exciting and emerging writers. To date, this has included Ranjit Bolt (''Three Sisters''), Gareth Jandrell (''Thebes'', published by Bloomsbury Methuen Drama), Emily Juniper (''[[Miss Julie]]'' and ''[[Vassa Zheleznova (play)|Vassa Zheleznova]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/13/rewriting-classical-theatre-women-faction-maxim-gorky-vassa-zheleznova|title=Rewriting classical theatre: 'Female characters are sad, have babies or talk about men'|last=Saner|first=Emine|date=2016-06-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-05|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and two unique projects: ''Reptember'' and ''Demetrius''.  

''Reptember'' is an [[Off West End]] award-nominated project, consisting of 12 classic texts adapted for solo performance by some of our most promising playwrights, including Jessica Sian and Will Gore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newdiorama.com/whats-on/reptember|title=New Diorama|last=http://feastcreative.com|first=Feast Creative|website=newdiorama.com|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Demetrius'' is an ongoing portmanteau project to complete [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s [[Demetrius (play)|final unfinished work]]. Established writers such as April de Angelis, Glyn Maxwell and Simon Reade complete a "unit" before passing the baton to up and coming writers like Jon Brittain and Daniel Kanaber.

'''''The Human Condition''''' ('''''La condition humaine''''') generally refers to two similar [[oil painting|oil on canvas]] paintings by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[surrealist]] [[René Magritte]]. One was completed in 1933 and is in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington DC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=70170 La condition humaine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013221719/http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=70170 |date=2008-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other was completed in 1935 and is part of the [[Simon Spierer Collection]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Taschen"&gt;Paquet, Marcel, ''Magritte.'' Taschen (2006), Koln, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of drawings of the same name exist as well, including one at the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1992.274 Cleveland Museum of Art - The Human Condition]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to other paintings ==

One of Magritte's most common artistic devices was the use of objects to hide what lies behind them. For example, in ''[[The Son of Man]]'' (1964) an apple hides the face of a man wearing a bowler hat, and in ''[[The Pleasure Principle (painting)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' (1937) a bright flash likewise obscures a face. In ''The Human Condition'', the cover-up appears in the form a painting within a painting.

Magritte had this to say of his 1933 work:
:In front of a window seen from inside a room, I placed a painting representing exactly that portion of the landscape covered by the painting. Thus, the tree in the picture hid the tree behind it, outside the room. For the spectator, it was both inside the room within the painting and outside in the real landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Torczyner, Harry, ''Magritte: Ideas and Images.'' New York, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magritte continues his explanation in a letter to the Belgian poet Achille Chavée. 
:"Which is how we see the world, namely, outside of us; although having only one representation of it within us. Similarily we sometimes remember a past event as being in the present. Time and space lose meaning and our daily experience becomes paramount. This is how we see the world. We see it outside ourselves, and at the same time we only have a representation of it in ourselves. In the same way, we sometimes situate in the past that which is happening in the present. Time and space thus loose the vulgar meaning that only daily experience takes into account. Questions such as 'What does this picture mean, what does it represent?' are possible only if one is incapable of seeing a picture in all its truth, only if one automaically understands that a very precise image does not show precisely what it is. It's like believing that the implied meaning is worth more than the overt meaning. There is no implied meaning in my paintings, despite the confusion that attributes symbolic meaning to my painting. How can anyone enjoy interpreting symbols? They are 'substitutes' that are only useful to a mind that is incapable of knowing the things themselves. A devotee of interpretation cannot see a bird; he only sees it as a symbol. Although this manner of knowing the 'world' may be useful in treating mental illness, it would be silly to confuse it with a mind that can be applied to any kind of thinking at all." &lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from Magritte's letter to A. Chavee, Sept. 30, 1960. Translation of primary source: http://www.mattesonart.com/the-human-condition-1933--1935-with-articles.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Paintings within paintings appear frequently in Magritte works. ''Euclidean Walks'' (1955) is a work perhaps most like ''The Human Condition.'' It places a canvas in front of a high window depicting the tower of a close building and a street below. In ''The Fair Captive'' (1947), there is a beach scene with an easel set up. As in the previous cases it holds a canvas depicting what the viewer might expect to be behind it. This time though, flames from a burning tuba in front of the frame are seen "reflected." ''The Call of the Peaks'' (1942) shows a mountain canvas in front of a mountain background which is buffeted on the right by a curtain.

The list of similar works can easily be extended to include such paintings as ''The Key to the Fields'' (1936), its 1964 reincarnation ''Evening Falls'' and the 1942 work ''The Domain of Arnheim'', all of which feature broken windows whose shattered glass pieces on the floor still show the outside world they used to conceal.

Another series of pieces which show both strong similarities and strong differences from ''The Human Condition'' are the works titled ''The Alarm Clock''. In these works, a painting is placed on an easel in front of a window or on a balcony with a simple landscape in the background. However, the painting does not show what may possibly be behind, but is instead an upside-down basic fruit still life.

Analysis: At first, one automatically assumes that the painting on the easel depicts the portion of the landscape outside the window that it hides from view. After a moment's consideration, however, one realizes that this assumption is based upon a false premise: that is, that the imagery of Magritte's painting is real, while the painting on the easel is a representation of that reality. In fact, there is no difference between them. Both are part of the same painting, the same artistic fabrication. It is perhaps to this repeating cycle, in which the viewer, even against his will, sees the one as real and the other as representation, that Magritte's title makes reference. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.70170.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Motorcycle Diaries''''' ({{lang-es|Diarios de Motocicleta|links=no}}) is a [[memoir]] that traces the early travels of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Ernesto "Che" Guevara]], then a 23-year-old medical student, and his friend [[Alberto Granado]], a 29-year-old biochemist. Leaving [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], in January 1952 on the back of a sputtering single cylinder 1939 [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] 500cc dubbed ''La Poderosa'' ("The Mighty One"), they desired to explore the South America they only knew from books.&lt;ref name="on_the_trail"&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2004/12/19/travel/19che.html On the Trail of the Young Che Guevara] by Rachel Dodes, ''The New York Times'', December 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; During the formative odyssey Guevara is transformed by witnessing the social injustices of exploited mine workers, persecuted [[communists]], ostracized [[lepers]], and the tattered descendants of a once-great [[Inca civilization]]. By journey's end, they had travelled for a [[Childbirth|symbolic nine months]] by motorcycle, steamship, raft, horse, bus, and hitchhiking, covering more than {{convert|8000|km|miles}} across places such as the [[Andes]], [[Atacama Desert]], and the [[Amazon River Basin]]. The diary ends with a declaration by Guevara, born into an upper-middle-class family, displaying his willingness to fight and die for the cause of the poor, and his dream of seeing a united Latin America.

Ernesto Guevara spent long periods traveling around Latin America during his studies of medicine, beginning in 1948, at the [[University of Buenos Aires]]. In January 1950, Guevara attempted his first voyage. He traversed {{convert|4500|km|miles}} through the northern provinces of Argentina on a bicycle on which he installed a small engine. He arrived at San Francisco del Chañar, near [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], where his friend Alberto Granado ran the dispensary of the leper-centre. This experience allowed Guevara to have long conversations with the patients about their disease.

This pre-expedition gave Guevara a taste of what would be experienced in his more extensive South American travels. The journey broke new ground for him in activities that would become central to his life: travelling and writing a diary.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Che: A Revolutionary Life|date=1997|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=0-8021-3558-7|edition=First Paperback|location=New York, New York, USA|last1=Anderson|first1=John Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|65}} His own father said that it was preparation for his subsequent long journeys across South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=Ernesto Guevara|editor1-last=De Toledo|editor1-first=Lucía Álvarez|title=Young Che: Memories of Che Guevara by his Father|date=2008|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York, New York, USA|isbn=978-0-307-39044-8|page=159|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guevara relied upon the hospitality of strangers that he encountered, as he and Granado would throughout their later travels. For example, following a puncture, he flagged down a lorry to take him to his next destination.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Che Guevara|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins Ltd|isbn=978-1-44340-566-9|edition=First Canadian|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|last1=De Toledo|first1=Lucía Álvarez}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|63}} In another instance, in [[Loreto, Santiago del Estero|Loreto]], he asked for hospitality from a local police officer when he had nowhere to stay.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|54}} The trip encouraged Guevara's style of traveling that would be seen in the Motorcycle Diaries.

It was the success of his Argentinian 'raid', as he so put it, that awakened in him a desire to explore the world and prompted the commencing of new travel plans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|65}}

Upon completion of his bicycle journey, ''[[El Gráfico]]'', a sports magazine in Argentina, published a picture of Guevara on the motorbike he used for the journey. The company that manufactured the engine Ernesto adapted to his bicycle tried to use it for advertising claiming it was very strong since Guevara had gone on such a long tour using its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.companeroche.com/index.php?id=40|title=the truth about Che Guevara: Adulthood|last=Hunt|first=Nigel|website=www.companeroche.com|language=en|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he continued studying, he also worked as a nurse on trading and petroleum ships of the Argentine national shipping-company. This allowed Guevara to travel from the south of [[Argentina]] to [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Trinidad]].

In January 1952 Guevara's older friend, [[Alberto Granado]], a biochemist, and Guevara, decided to take a year off from their medical studies to embark on a trip they had spoken of making for years: traversing South America on a motorcycle, which has metaphorically been compared to carbureted version of [[Don Quixote]]'s [[Rocinante]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/SB109597854336326564.htm Easy Revolutionary: Che Guevara Loves and Bikes In Fine 'Motorcycle Diaries'] by Joe Morgenstern, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', September 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Guevara and the 29-year-old Granado soon set off from [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]], astride a 1939 Norton 500 cc [[motorcycle]] they named ''La Poderosa II'' ("The Mighty II") with the idea of eventually spending a few weeks volunteering at the [[San Pablo, Peru|San Pablo]] Leper colony in [[Peru]] on the banks of the [[Amazon River]]. In total, the journey took Guevara through [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Panama]], and to [[Miami]], before returning home to [[Buenos Aires]].

[[Image:Che Guevara-Granado - Mapa 1er viaje - 1952.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Map of Guevara's trip with [[Alberto Granado]]. The red arrows correspond to trips by airplane, the last two of which Guevara took alone]]

The trip was carried out in the face of some opposition by Guevara's parents, who knew that their son was both a severe [[asthmatic]] and a medical student close to completing his studies. However, Granado, himself a doctor, assuaged their concerns by guaranteeing that Guevara would return to finish his degree (which he ultimately did).&lt;ref name="Telegraph11"&gt;[http://www.ottawacitizen.com/story_print.html?id=4431515&amp;sponsor= He Rode with Che]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', March 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stop: Miramar, Argentina, a small resort where Guevara's girlfriend, Chichina, was spending the summer with her upper-class family. Two days stretched into eight, and upon leaving, Chichina gave Guevara a gold bracelet. The two men crossed into [[Chile]] on February 14. At one point they introduced themselves as internationally renowned leprosy experts to a local newspaper, which wrote a glowing story about them. The travelers later used the press clipping as a way to score meals and other favors with locals along the way.

{{quote|"We are looking for the bottom part of the town. We talk to many beggars. Our noses inhale attentively the misery."| Guevara's entry on [[Valparaíso, Chile]]}}

In reference to his experience in [[Chile]], Guevara also writes: "The most important effort that needs to be done is to get rid of the uncomfortable '[[Yankee]]-friend'. It is especially at this moment an immense task, because of the great amount of dollars they have invested here and the convenience of using economical pressure whenever they believe their interests are being threatened."

{{Quote box

There we understood that our vocation, our true vocation, was to move for eternity along the roads and seas of the world. Always curious, looking into everything that came before our eyes, sniffing out each corner but only very faintly – not setting down roots in any land or staying long enough to see the substratum of things; the outer limits would suffice."

Unable to get a boat to [[Easter Island]] as they intended, they headed north, where Guevara's political consciousness began to stir as he and Granado moved into mining country.&lt;ref name="Che Guevara 2005, pg 9"&gt;Che Guevara: Symbol of Struggle, by Tony Saunois, CWI, 2005, {{ISBN|1-870958-34-9}} pg 9&lt;/ref&gt; They visited [[Chuquicamata]] copper mine, the world's largest open-pit mine and the primary source of Chile's wealth. While getting a tour of the mine he asked how many men died in its creation. At the time it was run by U.S. mining monopolies of [[Anaconda Copper|Anaconda]] and [[Kennecott Utah Copper|Kennecott]] and thus was viewed by many as a symbol of "[[imperialist]] gringo domination".&lt;ref name="Che Guevara 2005, pg 9"/&gt; A meeting with a homeless [[communist]] couple in search of mining work made a particularly strong impression on Guevara, who wrote: "By the light of the single candle ... the contracted features of the worker gave off a mysterious and tragic air ... the couple, frozen stiff in the desert night, hugging one another, were a live representation of the [[proletariat]] of any part of the world,"

In reference to the oppression against the Communist party in Chile, which at the time was outlawed, Guevara said: "It's a great pity, that they repress people like this. Apart from whether [[collectivism]], the ‘communist vermin,’ is a danger to decent life, the [[communism]] gnawing at his entrails was no more than a natural longing for something better, a [[Class struggle|protest]] against persistent hunger transformed into a love for this [[Marxist theory|strange doctrine]], whose essence he could never grasp but whose translation, 'bread for the poor,' was something he understood and, more importantly, that filled him with hope. Needless to say, workers at [[Chuquicamata]] were in a living [[Hell]]."

In [[Peru]], Guevara was impressed by the old [[Inca civilization]], forced to ride in trucks with Indians and animals after ''"The Mighty One"'' broke down. As a result, he began to develop a fraternity with the indigenous [[Peasant|campesinos]]. In March 1952 they both arrived at the Peruvian [[Tacna]]. After a discussion about the [[poverty]] in the region, Guevara referred in his notes to the words of Cuban poet [[José Marti]]: "I want to link my destiny to that of the poor of this world." In May they arrived in [[Lima]], [[Peru]] and during this time Guevara met doctor [[Hugo Pesce]], a Peruvian scientist, director of the national leprosy program, and an important local Marxist. They discussed several nights until the early morning and years later Che identified these conversations as being very important for his evolution in attitude towards life and society.

In May, Guevara and Granado left for the [[leper colony]] of San Pablo in the Peruvian [[Amazon Rainforest]], arriving there in June. During his stay Guevara complained about the miserable way the people and sick of that region had to live. Guevara also swam once from the side of the [[Amazon River]] where the doctors stayed, to the other side of the river where the [[leper]] patients lived, a considerable distance of {{convert|4|km|miles}}. He describes how there were no clothes, almost no food, and no medication. However, Guevara was moved by his time with the [[lepers]], remarking that

{{quote|"All the love and caring just consist on coming to them without gloves and medical attire, shaking their hands as any other neighbor and sitting together for a chat about anything or playing football with them."&lt;ref name = "A1950"&gt;[http://www.companeroche.com/index.php?id=40 Ernesto Che Guevara: 1950-1953]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:CheOnRaft1952.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Guevara (right) with [[Alberto Granado]] (left) aboard their "Mambo-Tango" wooden raft on the [[Amazon River]] in June 1952. The raft was a gift from the [[lepers]] whom they had treated]]

After giving consultations and treating patients for a few weeks, Guevara and Granado left aboard the Mambo-Tango raft (shown) for [[Leticia, Colombia]] via the [[Amazon River]].

While visiting [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], he wrote a letter to his mother on July 6, 1952. In the letter he described the conditions under the [[right-wing]] government of [[Conservative]] [[Laureano Gómez]] as the following: "There is more repression of individual freedom here than in any country we've been to, the police patrol the streets carrying rifles and demand your papers every few minutes". He also goes on to describe the atmosphere as "tense" and "suffocating" even hypothesizing that "a revolution may be brewing". Guevara was correct in his prognostication, as a military [[coup]] in 1953 would take place, bringing General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]] to power.

Later that month Guevara arrived in [[Caracas]], Venezuela and from there decided to return to [[Buenos Aires]] to finish his studies in medical science. However, prior to his return, he travelled by cargo plane to [[Miami]], where the airplane's technical problems delayed him one month. To survive, he worked as a waiter and washed dishes in a Miami bar.

Although he admitted throughout that as a [[vagabond (person)|vagabond]] traveler he could only see things at surface level, he did attempt to delve beneath the sheen of the places he visited. On one occasion he went to see a woman dying of tuberculosis, leaving appalled by the failings of the public health system. This experience led him to ruminate the following reflection: "How long this present order, based on the absurd idea of caste, will last is not within my means to answer, but it's time that those who govern spent less time publicizing their own virtues and more money, much more money, funding socially useful works."

{{quote|"It is at times like this, when a doctor is conscious of his complete powerlessness, that he longs for change: a change to prevent the injustice of a system in which only a month ago this poor woman was still earning her living as a waitress, wheezing and panting but facing life with dignity. In circumstances like this, individuals in poor families who can’t pay their way become surrounded by an atmosphere of barely disguised acrimony; they stop being father, mother, sister or brother and become a purely negative factor in the struggle for life and, consequently, a source of bitterness for the healthy members of the community who resent their illness as if it were a personal insult to those who have to support them."| Guevara while treating a peasant woman dying of [[tuberculosis]]}}

Witnessing the widespread endemic [[poverty]], [[oppression]] and [[disenfranchisement]] throughout Latin America, and influenced by his readings of Marxist literature, Guevara later decided that the only solution for the region's [[Social structure|structural]] inequalities was armed [[revolution]]. His travels and readings throughout this journey  also led him to view Latin America not as a group of separate nations, but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide strategy for [[Liberty|liberation]] from what he viewed as [[Imperialism|imperialist]] and [[neo-colonialism|neo-colonial]] domination. His conception of a borderless, united, Hispanic-America sharing a common '[[mestizo]]' bond, was a theme that would prominently recur during his later activities and transformation from Ernesto the traveler, into [[Che Guevara]] the iconic revolutionary.

{{quote|I knew that when the great guiding spirit cleaves humanity into two antagonistic halves, I will be with the people.| Guevara's conclusion}}

Although it is considered to be formative, scholars have largely ignored this period of Guevara's life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Che's Travels: The Making of a Revolutionary in 1950s Latin America|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822391805|location=Durham [NC]|last1=Drinot|first1=Paulo}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|2}} However, historians and biographers now agree that the experience had a profound impact on Guevara, who later became one of the most famous [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] leaders in history. "His political and social awakening has very much to do with this face-to-face contact with poverty, exploitation, illness, and suffering", said Carlos M. Vilas, a history professor at the Universidad Nacional de Lanús in Buenos Aires, Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1014_041014_motorcycle_diaries.html|title="Motorcycle Diaries" Shows Che Guevara at Crossroads|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, [[Alberto Granado]] described their journey to the [[BBC]], stating: "The most important thing was to realise that we had a common sensibility for the things that were wrong and unjust." According to Granado, their time at the [[leper colony]] of San Pablo in the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] also proved pivotal. Recalling that they shared everything with the sick people and describing Guevara's wave on departure as follows: "I got the impression that Che was saying goodbye to institutional medicine and becoming a doctor of the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4518213.stm|title='My best friend Che'|date=2005-05-09|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Granado later observed that by the end of their journey, "We were just a pair of [[Vagabond (person)|vagabonds]] with knapsacks on our backs, the dust of the road covering us, mere shadows of our old [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] egos."&lt;ref name = "lettersNYT" /&gt;

According to his daughter [[Aleida Guevara]] in a 2004 article, throughout the book we can see how Guevara became aware that what poor people needed was not his scientific knowledge as a doctor, but his strength and persistence to bring social change.&lt;ref name="aleida"&gt;{{cite news |title=Riding My Father's Motorcycle |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/09/opinion/09guevara.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=motorcycle+diaries&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin |author=Aleida Guevara |date=2008-10-09|accessdate=2008-04-08 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

Guevara's experience of the South American continent also helped to shape his revolutionary sensibilities. When discussing the plight of the downtrodden Indians of Peru, Granado discussed the formation of an Indian political party to begin a [[Túpac Amaru]] Indian Revolution. Guevara allegedly replied "Revolution without firing a shot? You're crazy?'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Toledo|first1=Lucía Álvarez|title=The Story of Che Guevara|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins Ltd|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=978-1-44340-566-9|page=86|edition=First Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journey was also formative in his political beliefs, for example historian Paulo Drinot notes that the journey stimulated his sentiments of [[Pan-Americanism]] that would later shape his revolutionary behaviors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|8}}

Scholar Lucía Álvarez De Toledo argues that it was on these motorcycle travels that he "disregarded his social class and his white European racial ancestry" and retained the view of himself as an Argentine, as a member of the United America he had encountered during his travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Toledo|first1=Lucía Álvarez|title=The Story of Che Guevara|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins Ltd|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=978-1-44340-566-9|page=93|edition=First Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having said this, with the exception of Guatemala, Guevara showed little concern with the policies of the countries he encountered.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|4}} In total however, Guevara's travels in the 1950s played an important role in determining his view on the world "and his later revolutionary trajectory."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|17}}

==Editions==
In 2004, Che Guevara's daughter, [[Aleida Guevara]], explained that her father had not intended his diary to be published, and that it had the state of "a sheaf of typewritten pages". But already in the 1980s, his family worked on his unpublished manuscripts, and a Cuban publishing house brought out ''The Motorcycle Diaries'' for the first time in 1993.&lt;ref name="aleida" /&gt;

The director of Ocean Press insists that the book had been legally published in Cuba and that any rumors of a conspiracy to prohibit its publication there are false. He also points out that the Union of Young Communists brought out an edition, with another to be published by the Che Guevara Studies Center.  Furthermore, he has given an assurance that its publication has the support of many people including [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E5DA1731F931A35755C0A9629C8B63&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=motorcycle+diaries&amp;st=nyt|title=Che Guevara's Diaries (letter to the editor|author1=David Deutschmann |author2=Publisher and President |author3=Ocean Press) |publisher=New York Times|date=2008-06-02|accessdate=2008-04-08}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Motorcycle Diaries:  Notes on a Latin American Journey'' was published by Ocean Press and the Che Guevara Studies Center, Havana, in 2003.  The book has a preface by Aleida Guevara March and an introduction by Cintio Vitier.  This edition is edited and translated by Alexandra Keeble.

===Editing===
Some observers have questioned the full veracity of the work based on its editing. Michael Casey wrote that, "''Diaries'' is not a diary at all but rather a deliberately constructed memoir that the young Ernesto fashioned and embellished."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casey|first1=Michael|title=Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image|date=April 2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York, New York, USA|isbn=978-0-307-27930-9|page=52|edition=A Vintage Books Original}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casey argues that revisions such as these cause Guevara to blur the line between fiction and nonfiction in his writings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other scholars have taken this claim even further. Frans Weiser argues that Guevara was not the only person that was editing and reshaping his notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weiser|first1=Frans|title=Writing "Che" Writing: Apocryphal Diaries and the Deconstruction of Guevara's Myth|journal=Hispania|date=4 December 2013|volume=96|issue=4|page=703|doi=10.1353/hpn.2013.0126|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/531376/pdf|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Paulo Drinot contends that the Cuban government, as well as others, reworked the texts for self-fashioning or political benefits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, Drinot also points out that Guevara's introduction explicitly mentions how the notes are "reorganized" and "polished", and that such a practicality should in no way undermine its utility as a historical source.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|8}}

==Review==
{{Quote|"Guevara's youthful Motorcycle Diaries is rebellious in ways that are not immediately obvious. This travelogue shows Ernesto the Medical Student developing a sense of Pan-Latin Americanism that fuses the interests of indigenous Andean peasants with traditional adversaries like upper-middle-class Argentine intellectuals (i.e. Guevara). The book ventures a unified regional opposition to U.S. hegemony and global capitalism's sometimes ravaging effects on Latin America."| [[World Hum]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldhum.com/features/travel-books/nine-subversive-travel-books-non-fiction-20091109/ Nine Subversive Travel Books] by Thomas Kohnstamm, ''[[World Hum]]'', January 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Theodor Lipps''' ({{IPA-de|lɪps|lang}}; 28 July 1851 – 17 October 1914) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]], famed for his theory regarding [[aesthetics]], creating the framework for the concept of ''Einfühlung'' (empathy)'',''  defined as, "projecting oneself onto the object of perception."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodor-Lipps|title=Theodor Lipps {{!}} German psychologist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has then led onto opening up a new branch of interdisciplinary research in the overlap between psychology and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Robin|last2=Elliott|first2=Richard George|date=December 2014|title=An Introduction to Einfühlung|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17561310.2014.11425535?needAccess=true|journal=Art in Translation|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=353–376|doi=10.1080/17561310.2014.11425535|issn=1756-1310}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==
Lipps was one of the most influential German university professors of his time, attracting many students from other countries. Lipps was very concerned with conceptions of art and the aesthetic, focusing much of his philosophy around such issues. Among his fervent admirers was [[Sigmund Freud]]. Lipps then being the main supporter of the idea of the [[Unconscious mind|Unconscious]].&lt;ref&gt;Pigman, G.W. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=7628894&amp;dopt=Abstract Freud and the history of empathy], ''The International journal of psycho-analysis'', 1995 Apr.; 76 (Pt 2):237–56.&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted [[Robert Vischer]]'s notions of [[empathy]] or esthetic sympathy (''Einfühlung'', literally translated to "feeling-into"). This concept of aesthetic resonance finds parallels throughout aesthetic philosophy. Late in life, Lipps adopted some ideas from [[Edmund Husserl]]. Disliking his psychologism, some of his students joined with some of Husserl's to form a new branch of philosophy called [[phenomenology of essences]]. Among them there was [[Moritz Geiger]] who wrote one of the first phenomenological essays on the essence and meaning of empathy in which the influence of Lipps is relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Gödel, Florian (2015), "An introduction to Moritz Geiger’s psychological contribution on empathy." ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''8'''(1):161–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urban art''' is a style of art that relates to cities and city life often done by artists who live in or have a passion for city life. In that way urban art combines [[street art]] and [[graffiti]] and is often used to summarize all [[visual art]] forms arising in [[urban area]]s, being inspired by urban architecture or present urban lifestyle. Because the urban arts are characterized by existing in the public space, they are often viewed as [[vandalism]] and destruction of private property.

Although urban art started at the neighborhood level, where a lot of people of different cultures live together, it is an international art form with an unlimited number of uses nowadays. Many urban artists travel from city to city and have social contacts all over the world. The notion of 'Urban Art' developed from street art which is primarily concerned with [[graffiti]] culture. Urban art represents a broader cross-section of artists that, in addition to covering traditional street artists working in formal gallery spaces, also cover artists using more traditional media but with a subject matter that deals with contemporary urban culture and political issues. In Paris, [[Le Mur (urban art)|Le Mur]] is a [[Public art|public]] museum of urban art.

== In the mainstream ==
Though starting as an underground movement, urban artists like [[Banksy]] and [[Adam Neate]] have now gained mainstream status and have, in turn, propelled the urban art scene into popular culture. Perceptions have started to change as urban movements such as graffiti slowly gain acceptance from the public. A confirmation of street art's new mainstream status can be, in part, confirmed by an invitation from the [[Tate]] calling upon artists to create outdoor pieces on the Thames side of the gallery in the summer of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/apr/08/streetartattate|title=Street Art is Officially Mainstream|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band [[Gorillaz]] uses an urban art style to promote their band. The band members are animated in a [[graffiti]] style.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5679">'''Water marble nails''' are a [[nail art]] technique involving dropping [[nail lacquer]]s into clear water and creating a pattern on the water surface, the pattern is then transferred to the nails.

== History ==
The water marble nail technique was originally developed by professional nail technicians in Japanese nail salons. In the 1990s, it was popularized by commercial publications released by shopping centers in [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]], [[Japan]]. In 2010, water marble nail art was adapted to use acrylic [[artificial nails]] and gels.

The water marble nail technique has gained popularity across the globe through features in magazines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nailpro.com/water-marble-manicure/ | title=Water Marble Manicure | work=Nail Pro | date=24 June 2011 | author=James, Megan}}&lt;/ref&gt; websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nair|first=Sonia|title=Create Marble Nail Art Using Water|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/create-marble-nail-art-using-water.html|work=Buzzle|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denza|first=Diana|title=How To Create The Water Marble Nail Manicure|url=http://www.bettyconfidential.com/ar/ld/a/how-to-create-the-water-marble-nail-manicure.html/|work=Betty Confidential|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  polish makers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pupa.it/ita/pupa-nail-academy/Video-nail-academy/spring-flowers-con-tecnica-water-marble.aspx | title=Spring Flowers con Tecnica Water Marble | work=Pupa Milano | language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sagaraya|first=Sonal|title=DIY Marble Nail Art Stickers|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5S2QGHfOH0|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Styles ==
[[File:Water marble nail method3.JPG|thumb|Water marble nail art method, free-dragging]]
[[File:Water marble nail method2.JPG|thumb|Water marble nail art method, free-dropping]]
There are two main types of water marble nail art methods: free-dragging and free-dropping. Free-dragging is more common.

===Free-dragging===
Dragged patterns range from simple circular shapes to complicated drawings. Patterns such as marble, hearts/peacocks,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The pattern called "hearts" is also called "peacock", the name of a professional nail art technique. Drawing a "peacock" is one challenge to professional nail artists sponsored by the Japan Nailist Association.&lt;/ref&gt; animals, flowers, leaves, parallel lines, [[Psychedelic art|psychedelics]], spiderwebs, and random patterns in the style of designer [[Emilio Pucci]] are generally performed with nail lacquers and some kind of tool.

===Free-dropping===
Dropped patterns range from colored shapes to complicated drawings such as spirals and geometric designs. The free patterns are created by colored drops of nail lacquer. For free-dropping, lacquer colors are dropped straight or diagonally onto the water. The pattern floats on the surface of the water.

== Technique ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=November 2016}}
Water marble nail art requires clean water, nail lacquers for free-dropping, and a stick for drawing patterns. Before patterns are created, the nails are painted with a light-colored nail polish that establishes a good contrast with the colors chosen to create the water marble. Some techniques use a matte coat to provide contrast and maintain an even look.

After the base coat has dried, tape is put around the fingers to gather the excess nail polish after the marbling. One or two drops of colored lacquer are chosen for the design and are added to a cup of clean water. The drops will create a circle on the water surface. The next color is added on top of the circle created by the previous drop. The resulting pattern is ready for application to the nail, but it can still be modified with a stick or toothpick to create different shapes. The nail is dipped into the pattern on the water and kept under water as a [[Q-tip]] is used to "grab" the remaining polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Namuli|first1=Mary Janet|title=Water Marble Nails - What You Need To Know|url=http://www.designsauthority.com/water-marble-nails/|website=Designs Authority|accessdate=27 November 2016|date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
