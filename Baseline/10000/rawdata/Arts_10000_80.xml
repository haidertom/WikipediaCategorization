The '''Arts Club of Washington''' is a club to promote the Arts in [[Washington, D.C.]]. 

Founded by [[Bertha Noyes]] in May 1916, its first president was [[Henry Kirke Bush-Brown]]; [[Mathilde Mueden Leisenring]] was among its original members,&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ouVv4ZEx4 |title=Pat Moore on Mathilde Mueden Leisenring Exhibit |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-12-09 |accessdate=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were [[Susan Brown Chase]], [[Catharine Carter Critcher]], [[Lola Sleeth Miller]], [[Bertha E. Perrie]], and [[Mary Gine Riley]].&lt;ref name="McMahan1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Virgil E.

It is located at the [[Cleveland Abbe House]]. Since 2006, the Club has awarded the Marfield Prize, also known as the National Award for Arts Writing, for nonfiction books about the arts written for a broad audience.

The club supports visual, performing, and literary arts in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/arts-club-of-washingtons-quirky-downtown-haven-of-clubby-culture-survives-the-ages/2011/05/09/AFVC8u7G_story.html|title=Arts Club of Washington’s quirky downtown haven of clubby culture survives the ages|last=Montgomery|first=David|date=2011-05-20|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hosts a noon-time concert series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://artsclubofwashington.org/friday-noon-concerts/|title=Friday Noon Concerts - DC Art Events {{!}} DC Wedding Reception Venue|work=DC Art Events {{!}} DC Wedding Reception Venue|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It awards arts scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corcoran.gwu.edu/arts-club-washington%E2%80%99s-2018-scholarship-competition|title=The Arts Club of Washington’s 2018 Scholarship Competition {{!}} Corcoran School of the Arts &amp; Design {{!}} The George Washington University|website=corcoran.gwu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Marfield Prize, National Award for Arts Writing ==
{{main|Marfield Prize}}
The Marfield Prize, also known as the National Award for Arts Writing, is given annually by the Arts Club of Washington to nonfiction books about the arts written for a broad audience. Intended to help increase access to the arts, the Prize "celebrates prose that is lucid, luminous, clear, and inspiring—writing that creates a strong connection with arts and artists."&lt;ref name=2014guidelines /&gt;

The Prize of $10,000, which the Club asserts is the only one of its kind in the country, honors nonfiction books first published in the U.S., by a single author who is living at the time of the book’s nomination. First given in 2006, the prize’s endowment was established by long-time Arts Club member Jeannie S. Marfield in honor of Florence Berryman and Helen Wharton.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Bob |title=Tale of Folk Hero Wins New Award For Arts Writing |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/25/AR2007042502665.html |accessdate=2013-02-27 |work=The Washington Post |date=April 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award is given to the author of a nonfiction book about any artistic discipline (visual, literary, performing, or media arts, as well as cross-disciplinary works. Works of art history and criticism, biographies and memoirs, and essays are all eligible. Anthologies, creative works of fiction or poetry, books for children, exhibition catalogs and self-published books are not eligible.&lt;ref name=2014guidelines&gt;{{cite web |title=2014 Award Guidelines |url=http://artsclubofwashington.org/about/award-for-arts-writing/ |publisher=Arts Club of Washington |accessdate=2014-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the club noticed that there was a lack of "good, accessible writing about the arts," according to former award administrator Sarah Browning. Club members decided to use a bequest by longtime member Jeannie S. Marfield to remedy the situation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In addition to the annual winners, the Club publishes the names of several finalists.

Snyder died unexpectedly August 4, 2009, of what was characterized as either a [[pulmonary embolism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profiles: Blake Snyder|url=http://www.storylink.com/profile/blakesnyder|website=ScriptMag.Com (was Storylink.Com)|publisher=The Writers Store|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernandez|first1=Jay A.|title=Scribe Blake Snyder dies at 51|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/scribe-blake-snyder-dies-51-87395|accessdate=January 5, 2015|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]/[[Associated Press]]|date=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finke|first1=Nikki|title=R.I.P.

== Early life ==
Snyder's father, Kenneth C. T. Snyder, was an [[Emmy]]-winning TV producer of many children's shows in the 1960s and 1970s. Among them were ''The Funny Company'', ''Hot Wheels'', animated segments on ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''Big Blue Marble'' and the cult classic ''[[Roger Ramjet]]''.

At the age of eight, Snyder was hired by his father as a voice talent for an animated special starring [[Sterling Holloway]]. Snyder continued doing children's voices alongside [[Gary Owens]], [[June Foray]] and others until his voice changed and he was fired by his producer father.

Snyder went on to earn a B.A. degree in English from [[Georgetown University]], and returned to Los Angeles where he began his career writing for the [[Disney]] TV series ''[[Kids Incorporated]]''. Snyder began writing full-time as a screenwriter in 1987. He was a member of the [[Writers Guild of America]] for over 20 years.

Snyder's first [[Spec script|spec]] screenplay sale was in 1989 for the script ''[[Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot]]'', which sold for $500,000 in a bidding war.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;''Variety'', page 6, Nov. 1989 "First Time Writers Fare Well at W &amp; A" – ''Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot'' script sale.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HR"&gt;''The Hollywood Reporter'', Cover Story, October 3, 1990 – "Fierce Bidding War".&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to sell 12 more original screenplays and was named "one of Hollywood's most successful spec screenwriters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writersupercenter.com/studionotes/columns/column43.htm Screenwriter Blake Snyder], Hollywoodlitsales/StudioNotes&lt;/ref&gt; Million dollar script sales include ''[[Blank Check (film)|Blank Check]]'', co-written with Colby Carr for Walt Disney Pictures, and ''Nuclear Family'', co-written with James Haggin for [[Steven Spielberg]]/Amblin Entertainment.&lt;ref name="Variety2"&gt;''Variety'', page 5, April 12, 1993 – Blank Check script sale.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HR2"&gt;''The Hollywood Reporter'', page 4, April 12, 1993 – Blank Check and Nuclear Family script sales.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Save the Cat!'' ==
Snyder's nonfiction book ''Save the Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need'' was the number one selling book among screenwriting manuals on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and in 2018 is on its 34th printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blake Snyder|url=https://www.amazon.com/Blake-Snyder/e/B00LWI2JXA|website=Amazon.Com|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book describes in detail the structure of the [[monomyth]] or ''hero's journey'', providing a by-the-minute pattern for screenwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save the Movie! |author=Peter Suderman | publisher=[[Slate.com]] |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/07/hollywood_and_blake_snyder_s_screenwriting_book_save_the_cat.single.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin of the title ===
The title ''Save The Cat!'' was coined by Snyder to describe a decisive moment when the protagonist does something nice—like, literally, saving a cat.  Snyder writes that, "it's the scene where we [first] meet the hero," in order to gain audience favor and support for the main character right from the start.  In the opening scene of the movie, ''Frequency'', for example, Frank Sullivan, played by Dennis Quaid, is the veteran firefighter that jumps into a manhole to save two workers from a gas explosion.  Prior to his death-defying rescue, his chief warns, "Frank, you're not going to make it.  There's not enough time."  Frank, a true hero, doesn't seem overly alarmed.  This is what he does. His concern is primarily for the men below as he confidently jokes, "What, miss the World Series? Not a chance."  From this moment on, the audience is fully invested in Frank's wellbeing and rooting for him to succeed.

According to Snyder, this crucial element is missing from many of today's movies.  He referenced ''Lara Croft Tomb Raider 2: The Cradle of Life'' (2003) - as being a film that focused on making the character Lara Croft "cool" and sexy (via a "new latex body suit for Angelina Jolie") instead of likable.  An estimated $95 million was spent on this film, and it only grossed $156.5 worldwide ($65.6 million in the U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325703/business&lt;/ref&gt;  This sequel did not lose money, but it earned considerably less than the original ''Lara Croft Tomb Raider'' (2001), which grossed $274.7 million worldwide ($131.1 million in the U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146316/business&lt;/ref&gt;

His inspiration for this was the movie ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', where [[Sigourney Weaver]]'s character [[Ellen Ripley|Ripley]] saves a cat named Jones.

In his book, Snyder gave greatest emphasis on the importance of [[structure]] through his Blake Snyder Beat Sheet or the "BS2" which includes the 15 essential "beats" or plot points that all stories should contain.

Snyder's method expanded the 15 beats further into 40 beats, which are laid out on "The Board." The Board is divided into 4 rows, with each row representing a quarter of the story, namely the 1st Act, the 1st half of the 2nd Act, the 2nd half of the 2nd Act, and the 3rd Act.

Snyder also introduced 10 [[genres]] in his book that distinguished how stories are structured. According to Snyder, standard genre types such as Romantic Comedy, Epic or Biography did not say much about the story, only the type of movie it is. Snyder's system explored genre more fully, with categories such as "Monster in the House", "Golden Fleece", "Buddy Love" and others.

===Book series===
In 2007, Snyder wrote ''Save the Cat! Goes to the Movies''. The second book took 50 landmark movies, identified their specific genres, and broke them down into the 15 beats of the BS2.

The third book of Snyder's series, ''Save the Cat! Strikes Back: More Trouble For Screenwriters To Get Into… and Out Of'', was published in November, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suderman|first=Pete|title=Save the Movie!|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/07/hollywood_and_blake_snyder_s_screenwriting_book_save_the_cat.single.html|publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last book in the series to be authored by Snyder himself.

The fourth book was a compliation of Blake's blogs and other writings on the subject of screenwriting, titled "Save the Cat! Blake's Blogs: More Information and Inspiration for Writers", (published in 2016).

The fifth book was written by his student, Spanish screenwriter and novelist [[Salva Rubio]]. It is titled "Save the Cat! Goes to the Indies" and features the analysis of 50 independent, European, auteur and cult films (published in April, 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save the Cat|url=https://store.savethecat.com/collections/products/products/save-the-cat-goes-to-the-indies-the-screenwriters-guide-to-50-films-from-the-masters|publisher=Savethecat.com|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth is the first non-screenwriting book, ''Save the Cat! Writes a Novel: The Last Book On Novel Writing That You'll Ever Need'', written by student and YA novelist Jessica Brody, (published on October 9, 2018).

===Software===
As a companion to his books, Snyder developed a story structure [https://store.savethecat.com/products/save-the-cat-story-structure-software software] product called ''Save the Cat! The Last Story Structure Software You'll Ever Need''. The software places Snyder's ''Beat Sheet and Board'' on an [[end user]]'s desktop, phone, or tablet. In 2008, Snyder and software company [[Final Draft (software)|Final Draft]], Inc. specializing in script formatting, became partners in building import/export functions between the two programs.&lt;ref name="Final Draft"&gt;''Final Draft'' Press Release March 24, 2008 ''Final Draft Introduces Two New Development Software Partners''.&lt;/ref&gt; Snyder's company, Blake Snyder Enterprises, LLC, released an iPhone app of the software in November, 2009 and an Android app in 2016. Version 4 of the software and apps, which includes new templates for novelists and tv writers, will be released in the 4th quarter of 2018.

=== Workshops and consultations ===
Snyder developed two weekend workshops for writers, filmmakers and executives. The introductory class, ''The Beat Sheet Workshop'', helped participants come up with the solid structure of the 15 beats, before they embark on the actual writing of the script. In addition, The Beat Sheet Workshop was expanded to be led internationally.

The second workshop, a continuation of the first, called ''The Board Workshop'', had participants take their 15 beats and expand them into 40 cards for a more detailed story structure. Snyder held his workshops all over the United States, Europe and Asia. The workshops were run year round.  Snyder also taught his method in such universities as [[UCLA]], [[Chapman University]], [[Vanderbilt University]] and the [[Beijing Film Academy]].

The in-person Beat Sheet Workshops continue, taught by "Master Cats" who were mentored by Snyder. The Beat Sheet Workshops expanded with [http://www.savethecatu.com online courses] in 2017.

Following the release of his first book, Snyder provided script analysis to studios such as [[Disney]], [[DreamWorks]], [[Laika]] and [[Nelvana]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.savethecat.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dedications==
''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (DreamWorks, 2010) was dedicated to Snyder.&lt;ref name="How the Dragon Really Got Trained"&gt;http://www.blakesnyder.com/2010/03/26/how-the-dragon-really-got-trained/&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Whispers Under Ground]]'' (Gollancz, 2012) by [[Ben Aaronovitch]] was dedicated to him as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aaronovitch|first1=Ben|title=Whispers Under Ground|date=2012|publisher=Del Rey/Random House|page=''dedication page''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vE1mJ3z-NZYC&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burqush''' or '''Burkush''' ({{lang-ar|برقش}}) is an archaeological site situated {{convert|30|km|mi}} west of [[Damascus]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="BeattiePepper2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Beattie|author2=Timothy Pepper|title=The Rough Guide to Syria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9iCfkTe8v2EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA16|accessdate=21 September 2012|date=1 July 2001|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-718-8|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RuprechtsbergerErtel1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Erwin Maria Ruprechtsberger|author2=Christine Ertel|title=Vom Mount Hermon zum Djebel Burqush|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0KkKMAEACAAJ|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=1994|publisher=Stadtmuseum Linz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearby [[Wadi al-Qarn – Burqush Important Bird Area|Wadi al-Qarn]] is an important breeding site for wild [[bird]]s in the [[Middle East]] and has been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as an [[Important Bird Area]].&lt;ref name="EvansEast1994"&gt;{{cite book |author1=M. I. Evans |title=Important bird areas in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZrwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=1994|publisher=BirdLife International|isbn=978-0-946888-28-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site sits at an [[altitude]] of {{convert|1580|m|ft}} and overlooks the [[Damascus]] plain and surrounding hill country where herds of [[goat]]s and [[camel]]s wander the area. Due to the sensitive nature of the territory close to the borders with [[Lebanon]] and the [[Golan]], visitors may need a military escort to access the site, which is a ten-minute walk along a steep track away from the main road.&lt;ref name="BeattiePepper2001"/&gt;

Julien Aliquot suggested that the site may have been called '''Barkousa''' in ancient times. This was contrary to the location of '''Barkusha''' that had previously been suggested by [[Albrecht Alt]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Kaizer|title=The Variety of Local Religious Life in the Near East In the Hellenistic and Roman Periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgVD3WL0vAsC&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16735-3|pages=90–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century, it was renamed '''Justinianopolis''' ({{lang-el|Ἰουστινιανούπολις}}, "city of Justinian") after the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~tcrnadk/Lovell_2011.pdf Klein, Konstantin., Review of Aliquot, J., Inscriptions Grecques et Latines de la Syrie - Tome 11: Mount Hermon (Liban et Syrie) Beirut: Presses de l'IFPO (Bibliothèque archéologique et historique 183) Reviews, Levant, Vol 43, No 1, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Potts2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

==Byzantine basilica and Roman temple==
There are the ruins of two [[Roman temple]]s in the village that are included in a group of [[Temples of Mount Hermon]].&lt;ref name="Kaizer20082"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Kaizer|title=Aliquot, Julien., Sanctuaries and villages on Mount Hermon in the Roman period in The Variety of Local Religious Life in the Near East In the Hellenistic and Roman Periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgVD3WL0vAsC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=17 September 2012|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16735-3|pages=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dar1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shimʻon Dar|title=Settlements and cult sites on Mount Hermon, Israel: Ituraean culture in the Hellenistic and Roman periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tuwtAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=1993|publisher=Tempus Reparatum|isbn=978-0-86054-756-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruins of a 6th-century CE [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] [[basilica]] lie on the top of a hill which has been artificially flattened to form a two level plateau. The area around features numerous rock cut rooms and crypts. The podium on which the basilica is constructed is suggested to be that of a previous [[Roman temple]] suggested to date to the 1st century CE. The Roman temple itself is thought to have been built on the remains of a previous temple that had been in use for secular purposes for at least four hundred years earlier and possibly for many generations prior. The basilica is constructed of massive blocks of stone and the site is littered with other confusing blocks, some of which possibly resemble buildings or unusual [[geological]] outcrops.&lt;ref name="BeattiePepper2001"/&gt;

The temple complex at Burqush was mentioned by the [[Germany|German]] archaeological mission to [[Baalbek]] in 1903 and has received little study since then. A [[topographic]] and architectural survey of the site was conducted in 1999 by Gunnar Brands for the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]]. A dissertation covering the results of the survey is in progress by Frederike von Bargen.&lt;ref name="brands"&gt;[http://www.orientarch.uni-halle.de/digs/burqush/burqush.htm Burqush (Syria) - Archaeological Survey 1999, Funded by the German Research Foundation, Director: Prof. Dr. Gunnar Brands, Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg Institut für Altertumswissenschaften, Seminar für Orientalische Archäologie und Kunstgeschichte]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Bargen, Friederike., Die Kirchenanlage von Burqush im Hermongebirge und ihre Ausstattung, Institut für Orientalische Archäologie und Kunst (in progress)&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey noted complex substructures, and intended to document the surrounding settlements, [[tomb]]s, [[quarries]] and a [[propylon]] temple ruins. The survey was hampered by the remoteness and altitude of the site, tank shelling, and finding a settlement in the area that was twice as large as expected with numerous rock cut tombs nearby. The basement of the basilica was constructed from bedrock and showed a high technical quality of construction. Traces of bronze [[candle]] holders were found along with remnants of a [[marble]] cover that was white with gray veining. Twelve [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] were recorded in 1903, of which only eight remained in place, with three more displaced nearby, one reused for [[medieval]] farming. The twelfth capital had been covered in rubble and totally obscured. The east wall of the basilica features a [[portico]]. Foundations of what were thought to be a [[peristyle]] for the basilica were found to its north west, some of the area to the north was cleared and leveled by the military.&lt;ref name="brands"/&gt;  The remains of the settlement are dispersed on the east slope of the hill are also large buildings on the west slope.&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"/&gt;

'''''Consequences of War''''', also known as ''Horror of war'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/index1.html Karen, Emil, and Daniel Marx. "Web Gallery of Art: Consequences of War." Web Gallery of Art, Image Collection, Virtual Museum, Searchable Database of European Fine Arts (1000-1850).] Web. 10 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; was executed between 1638-1639 by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] in [[Oil painting|oil paint]] on [[canvas]]. It was painted for [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando II de' Medici]]. Although commissioned by an Italian, art historians characterize both the work and the artist as [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]]. It serves as a commentary on a European continent ravaged by the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the artist employed numerous symbols, both contemporary and ancient, to deplore the state of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner’s Art Through the Ages: 13th Edition Volume II&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
Mars: [[Mars (god)|Mars]] is the central figure in the composition. The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] god of war charges with shield and sword as well as [[breastplate]] and [[helmet]]. The figure's skin and cape are dominated by the color red to further emphasize his identity as the Roman god.

Book and Drawing: Underneath Mars's feet lie a book and a drawing. These represent the manner in which the arts and letters are forgotten and destroyed in the chaos and violence of war.

Temple of Janus: To the far left of the painting, the Temple of [[Janus]] appears with its door ajar. In Ancient Rome, the Temple of Janus would be closed to indicate times of peace while an open door denoted war. This phenomenon is referenced in [[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]] by [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/imperialfora/nerva/geminus.html |title=The Temple of Janus (Janus Geminus) |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Venus (goddess)|Venus]]: The Roman goddess of love (and Mars's mistress) endeavors to restrain Mars and maintain peace. Her arm is looped ineffectually around his in a physical gesture. Her expression, meanwhile, plaintively entreaties Mars to stop his charge. Venus is depicted in typical Rubensian fashion with characteristic rolls of exposed flesh (See Arrival of Marie de' Medici or [[The Judgment of Paris (Rubens)|The Judgment of Paris]] for comparison.&lt;ref name="nationalgallery1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/peter-paul-rubens |title=Peter Paul Rubens &amp;#124; artist &amp;#124; 1577 - 1640 &amp;#124; The National Gallery, London |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The goddess is accompanied by Amors and [[Cupid]]s who attempt to assist her.

[[Fury (mythology)|Fury]] [[Alecto|Alekto]]: Alekto drags Mars on to his destructive purpose with a torch held high. Alekto was the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and Roman incarnation of anger. She appears in both [[Virgil]]’s [[Aeneid]] and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante’s]] [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]. Alekto translates from the Greek to “the implacable or unceasing anger.”

[[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|Pestilence]] and [[Famine]]: These effects of war are depicted as [[monster]]s accompanying Fury Alekto in order to heighten the terror of the scene. In addition, they deliberately refer to the [[apocalypse]].

[[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmony]]: Rubens depicts Harmony as a woman holding a [[lute]]. However the chaos has pushed her to the ground and broken her lute. The damage to the lute represents the discord of war.

Mother: Beside Harmony a mother clutches a child. This, Rubens writes, shows how “War corrupts and disrupts and destroys everything” including “[[procreation]] and [[charitable organization|charity]].”&lt;ref&gt;Rubens’s 1638 letter to Justus Sustermans (reprinted in Gardner’s Art Through the Ages)&lt;/ref&gt;

Architect: An [[architect]] and his instruments have similarly fallen to the ground, showing how in times of war destruction and not creation is the norm.

Arrows: [[Arrow]]s lie on the ground near Venus and the Amors. When bound together they represent Concord but in their present state show its absence. Next to them lie the [[olive branch]] and [[caduceus]], the symbols of peace. They too are depicted cast upon the ground to signify their absence in [[Europe]]. 
	
Woman in black: The figure to Venus's left represents Europe and its suffering. Her cross-topped globe represents the Christian world and is carried by the small [[angel]] to her immediate left.

==Historical context==
Rubens painted Consequences of War between 1638 and 1639 in response to the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). The conflict's origins are complex and diverse but animosity between [[Protestant]]s and [[Catholic]]s played a significant role. In addition, struggles for [[political power]] in Europe contributed to and prolonged the war. Nearly all European states fought at some point in the conflict's long time span. The fighting involved Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Gardner’s Art Through the Ages&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the war represented a continuation and extension of [[Habsburg]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] rivalry as well as French and Habsburg animosity.

As depicted in Consequences of War, the fighting led to the destruction of large areas of Europe as well as outbreaks of both pestilence and famine. Much of the fighting took place in the German states which suffered significant [[depopulation]] as a result. The Thirty Years' War ended in 1648 with the treaties of [[Treaty of Osnabrück|Osnabruck]] and [[Treaty of Münster (1648)|Munster]] as well as the [[Peace of Westphalia]].

==Rubens the diplomat==
Peter Paul Rubens was not only a virtuosic painter but also a passionate and crafty [[diplomat]]. Rubens, although closely allied to [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]] and the [[Spanish Netherlands]], often had occasion to travel and visit foreign monarchs in his position as a court painter.&lt;ref name="nationalgallery1"/&gt;  Rubens associated with the dukes of [[Mantua]], King Phillip IV, Charles I, and [[Marie de' Medici]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; He served as a negotiator for the Spanish Netherlands (and for the cause of peace more generally), and for France and England.

Indeed, Rubens lobbied for an end to the Thirty Years' War with considerable passion and cleverness. The painter sought to bring Spain and England, traditional enemies, to peace in the hopes that the Spanish would then pressure the Dutch into following suit. During this period Rubens carried messages, demands, and concession agreements back and forth between Phillip IV and Charles I to ultimately reach a conclusion. For his diplomatic work Rubens was eventually decreed a “gentleman of the household” by Isabella&lt;ref name="nationalgallery1"/&gt;  and knighted by Charles I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamster |first=Mark |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703298004574459753201012282 |title=Peter Paul Rubens, Diplomat - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-10-10 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
This unique position as both a master painter and trusted diplomat clearly informed Consequences of War. The painting shows the artist's sincere desire for peace and his justified horror at how war has ravaged Europe. Indeed, his diplomatic work allowed him and burdened him with considerable knowledge of the state of the continent and the consequences war had wrought.

==Artistic style==
Rubens’ work, including Consequences of War, represents the height of Flemish Baroque painting. His style is referred to as pan-European and synthesizes elements of [[Italian Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] artists to form his own artistic approach. The work of [[Michelangelo]], [[Titian]], [[The Carracci|Carracci]], and [[Caravaggio]] informed Rubens's paintings in varying degrees.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Viewers note the influence of Michelangelo in Rubens's interest and brilliance in depicting the human form. Consequences of War contains not only Rubens's trademark women but also the well muscled forms of Mars, Alekto, and the architect. These muscular figures are reminiscent of the powerful specimens depicted in Michelangelo's [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]], [[David (Michelangelo)|David]], and [[The Creation of Adam]]. This trend in Rubens's art is actually best shown in the extraordinarily well built men of Rubens's [[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|Elevation of the Cross]].

Titian's influence is most evident with respect to depiction of the female nude. Rubens's women bear a striking resemblance to Titian's Venus with a Mirror and Nymph and Shepherd. However Titian's most famous work, [[Venus of Urbino]], undoubtedly inspired Rubens's depiction of her in Consequences of War. The similarity between the two portraits of the goddess is unmistakable.
 
Rubens's debt to Annibale Carracci lies at least in part in his composition. The densely populated drama of Consequences of War recalls Carracci's [[The Loves of the Gods (Carracci)|Loves of the Gods]], in particular [[The Triumph of Bacchus]]. Furthermore, the careful use of color, light, and shadow as opposed to line to show space used by Carracci in [[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Carracci)|Flight into Egypt]] became a key part of Rubens's style. Indeed, Rubens's style became a highly coloristic one.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The '''Dragon Awards''' are fan-voted awards that "recognize outstanding achievement in science fiction and fantasy literature, comics, gaming and filmed entertainment". They are given out annually at [[Dragon Con]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] since 2016.&lt;ref name="dragon-awards-20160331"&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Dragon Con|title=The Dragon Awards|url=http://awards.dragoncon.org/2016/03/31/the-dragon-awards/|date=March 31, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award process consists of two steps: a nomination step where each voter nominates one work of choice in each category, and a voting step where the finalists selected from the nominated works are voted on by each voter. The nominations and votes are collected electronically. Participation is available to everyone, requiring no membership or other fees to vote.&lt;ref name="dragon-awards-pr-20160404"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Official Press Release|publisher=Dragon Con|url=http://awards.dragoncon.org/2016/04/04/official-press-release/|date=April 4, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Controversy''':
The Dragon Awards have been criticized in Science-Fiction and fantasy fandom because of the appearance that the awards were created in conjunction with campaigns by the Rabid and [[Sad Puppies]] to attack the [[Hugo Award]], giving the impression that Dragon Con as a convention is itself aligned with these campaigns. &lt;ref&gt;http://corabuhlert.com/2016/09/06/the-2016-dragon-awards-or-participation-trophies-for-puppies/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics, such as bloggers "Camestros Felapton", Mike Glyer of File 770, and their commenters,&lt;ref&gt;http://file770.com/2018-dragon-awards-ballot/comment-page-1/&lt;/ref&gt; have noted that the Dragon Awards process is not transparent, but "opaque".&lt;ref&gt;https://camestrosfelapton.wordpress.com/category/dragon-awards/&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Dragon Awards process, "The Dragon Awards reserves the right to invalidate suspect or questionable ballots without notice." Language describing the review of nominations does not state that nominations are counted numerically but are "gathered and reviewed to create a final ballot."&lt;ref&gt;http://awards.dragoncon.org/faq/fan-faq/&lt;/ref&gt; Neither counts of nominations nor votes have ever been made public. The system for voting is done by email and unprotected Survey Monkey, and is easily subject to mass voting campaigns, whether by self-promoting authors, or by organized political groups. In its first year, the Dragon Awards lined up with the slate promoted by [[Vox_Day|Vox Day]]&lt;ref&gt;https://camestrosfelapton.wordpress.com/2016/09/08/the-obligatory-dragon-awards-post/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, nominated authors, Allison Littlewood, [[John Scalzi]], and [[N.K. Jemisin]]  asked Dragon Con to remove their names from the ballot. John Scalzi then reconsidered and kept his name on the ballot. The Dragon Awards initially refused to remove authors names, and received criticism across blogs and Science-Fiction related publications. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jimchines.com/2017/08/dragon-awards/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16118054/john-scalzi-alison-littlewood-dragon-awards-controversy-sci-fi-horror&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://nkjemisin.com/2017/08/withdrawing-from-the-dragon-awards/&lt;/ref&gt;


There are currently fifteen categories for the awards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15822">'''Everyday Aesthetics''' is a recent subfield of philosophical [[aesthetics]] focusing on everyday events, settings and activities in which the faculty of [[sensibility]] is saliently at stake. [[Alexander Baumgarten]] established Aesthetics as a discipline and defined it as ''scientia cognitionis sensitivae'', the science of sensory knowledge, in his foundational work ''Aesthetica'' (1750).&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/aestheticascrip00baumgoog&lt;/ref&gt; This field has been dedicated since then to the clarification of [[fine arts]], [[beauty]] and [[taste]] only marginally referring to the aesthetics in [[design]], [[crafts]], urban environments and social practice until the emergence of everyday aesthetics during the ‘90s. As other subfields like environmental aesthetics or the [[aesthetics of nature]], everyday aesthetics also attempts to countervail aesthetics' almost exclusive focus on the philosophy of art.

== Grounding aesthetics in experience ==

Aesthetic inquiry on everyday life owes much of its approach to [[John Dewey]]’s (1934) pragmatist aesthetics, even if he was interested in grounding mainly artistic experience. Dewey pointed at a variety of circumstances in which sensibility is present emphasizing the importance of feeling, energy, and rhythm in every creature’s intercourse with its environment. He thus stressed not only the artistic but the everyday doings and undergoings that involve alertness and intensity of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John ''Art as Experience'' (New York: Perigee,1934)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey explored aesthetics from the subjects' experience rather than from objects' status as artworks and museum collections. This turn would allow overcoming object-centric approaches to aesthetics that hindered any consideration of the aesthetic beyond artistic and beautiful things justifiable by intrinsic qualities categorized as aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Updating Dewey’s pragmatism, [[Richard Shusterman]] validates aesthetic experience and emphasizes the role of the body in what he defines as ''soma-aesthetics'' also related to everyday life. C.F. Shusterman, Richard ''Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics'' ( Cambridge University Press 2008). See also Shusterman, Richard. 1992. ''Pragmatist Aesthetics: Living Beauty, Rethinking Art''. Cambridge: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social dimension of everyday aesthetics ==

The neglect of aesthetic theory to consider the role of sensibility in everyday life was first pointed out by [[Katya Mandoki]] who in 1994 coined the word '''''Prosaics'''''&lt;ref&gt;Mandoki Katya, ''Prosaica; introducción a la estética de lo cotidiano'' (México: Grijalbo, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; (drawing a distinction from [[Aristotle]]’s '''''Poetics'''''&lt;ref&gt;[[Poetics (Aristotle)]]&lt;/ref&gt; focused on art) to denote a sub-discipline that would specifically inquire the aesthetics involved in daily activities emphasizing the styles and forms of expression in [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] and context determined interactions. Prosaics or the theory of everyday aesthetics analyzes in this and subsequent texts the social conventions on what is considered acceptable or not by implicit standards of taste in each institutional setting (school, family, religion, politics, artworld, medical practice, sports). Six books and several articles i.e. ''Everyday Aesthetics; Prosaics, social identities and the play of culture'' (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Mandoki Katya, ''Everyday Aesthetics; Prosaics, social identities and the play of culture'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), ''Estética cotidiana y juegos de la cultura: Prosaica I'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2006,  ''Prácticas estéticas e identidades sociales: Prosaica II'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2006), ''La construcción estética del Estado y de la identidad nacional: Prosaica III'' (México: Siglo XXI editores, 2007), ''Estética y comunicación; de acción, pasión y seducción'' (Bogotá: Norma, 2007), “Quotidian Aesthetics” ''New Perspectives in Aesthetics and Philosophy of Art. Annales d’ esthétique''. Volume 42/2003-2004. Athens: Panayotis and Effie Michelis Foundation. Pp. 103-110. ISSN 1105-0462. "L'esthétique du quotidien"  ''Diogène'' 2011/1-2 (n° 233-234). [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/ca/7523862.0008.004?rgn=main;view=fulltext]
&lt;/ref&gt; consistently analyze the wide spectrum of the non-artistic within personal and collective experience. The role of the aesthetic is examined through symbolic interaction, identity negotiation and dramaturgical performance to produce specific sensitive effects and impact upon sensibility. As a multi-sensorial phenomenon, prosaics pays attention to the whole range of sensorial display for affecting participants' sensibility (body language, the visual, setting and props, intonation and styles of language) and not only sight and hearing as has been customary in aesthetics.

== Political dimension, violence and negativity in everyday aesthetics ==

An approach to everyday aesthetics involves both the positive and negative, the enriching and the toxic effects operating on sensibility. Joseph H. Kupfer brought to the attention of aesthetic inquiry the importance of focusing on the effects of violence and ultraviolence in modern society. Kupfer makes explicit the aesthetic ground of violence in society and emphasizes destruction as an aesthetic process producing vivid sensations.&lt;ref&gt;Kupfer Joseph H., ''Experience as Art: Aesthetics in Everyday Life'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; He highlighted also the need of incorporating aesthetics to education not only by means of teaching art but aesthetically, i.e. in the manner itself of educating through the rhythm, organization of subject matter, and method of presentation to engage students with the content of study.  Mandoki points at the negative use of aesthetics for manipulating emotions in the political sphere and refers to Nazi propaganda as a case in point that exemplifies the deliberate use of aesthetics for exerting violence.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Mandoki, "Terror and Aesthetics: Nazi Strategies for Mass Organisation," in Fascism: Critical Concepts in Political Science, vol. III, Fascism and Culture, Part 7: Fascism as the Negation or Revolution of Culture, ed. Roger Griffin (New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 21-38.return to text&lt;/ref&gt; The utilization of aesthetics for political agendas, specifically in the legitimation of the nation-state is dealt by this author.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Mandoki, ''La construcción estética del estado y de la identidad nacional''.

== Beauty in daily life, environmental aesthetics and artification ==
[[Yi-Fu Tuan]] proposed that we should apply the traditional aesthetic categories of beauty, contemplation, disinterestedness, and distancing in valuing daily life through different non artistic objects and locations.[http://www.yifutuan.org/]&lt;ref&gt;Tuan Yi–Fu ''Passing Strange and Wonderful; Aesthetics, Nature and Culture'' (New York, Tokyo, London: Kodansha 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1974 he insisted on the need of paying due attention to the environment as object of aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Tuan,Yi–Fu. ''Topophilia; A Study of Environmental Perception, Attitudes and Values''(Englewood Cliff, N.J.: Prentice Hall 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;  Along this line Crispin Sartwell also proposed in 1995 applying aesthetics to life itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sartwell, Crispin ''The Art of Living: Aesthetics of the Ordinary in World Spiritual Traditions''. (Albany: State University of New York Press 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Yuriko Saito, an environmentalist aesthetician specializing in Japanese aesthetics, argues for paying attention to weather as worthy of aesthetic appreciation and for making moral and aesthetic judgments on everyday artifacts, landscapes, lawns, and neighborhood eyesores&lt;ref&gt;[[Eyesore]]&lt;/ref&gt; that are conflicting with the harmony of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, Yuriko. 2008. ''Everyday Aesthetics''. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Saito advocates a self-critical artification of everyday life and warns about the risks of artificating business.[http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=640] Paulina Rautio has performed qualitative analysis by interviews and epistolary exchange with women in regards to their experience of beauty through non artistic items and their contexts such as hanging laundry in Lapland where the opportunity of drying clothes under the sun is rare.&lt;ref&gt;Rautio, Pauliina, Rautio, P. (2010). Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives. ''Journal of Aesthetic Education'', Vol 44, No4, Rautio, P. (2009). On hanging laundry. The place of beauty in managing everyday life. Contemporary Aesthetics, Vol 7, No9.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a common interest in this approach for understanding aesthetics as a theory of art and beauty following traditional categories and at the same time attempting to go beyond conventional borders of art by artificating the non art and extending its scope to everyday objects, environments and to living itself. That is the case of Horacio Pérez-Henao who tries to interpret literature under the scope of everyday aesthetics by pointing out how fictional characters experience aesthetics into their daily lives &lt;ref&gt;Pérez-Henao, Horacio. “Estética cotidiana y ficción: el clima como elemento
de significación en la novela Pequod de Vitor Ramil”. Anclajes XX. 1 (enero-abril

== Sports and food as art ==

Every work of art has, since the Renaissance, tried to expand themes worthy of artistic expression and concepts of artistic value to include new subject matters, techniques and styles in painting and sculpture, new harmonies, consonances or dissonances in music, new attitudes, gestures, and different genres and requirements of quality. However the initiative of applying the concept of art literally to non artistic activities within a theoretical framework related to everyday aesthetics came from philosophers like David Best, Wolfgang Welsch and Lev Kreft proposing to consider sports as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;Best, David. 1988. “The Aesthetic in Sport,” in ''Philosophic Inquiry in Sport'', ed. William J. Morgan and Klaus V. Meier. Champaign: Human Kinetics Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welsch, Wolfgang "Sport–Viewed Aesthetically, and Even as Art?" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreft, Lev "Aesthetics of the beautiful game" ''Soccer &amp; Society'' 2012: 1-23&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist aestheticians are also advocating for the inclusion of other senses beyond the two traditional sight and hearing, as in taste ([[Carolyn Korsmeyer]]) and smell (Emily Brady), that can render aesthetic experiences in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Emily "Sniffing and Savoring: The Aesthetics of Smells and Tastes" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press 2005); Korsmeyer, Carolyn ''Making Sense of Taste: Food &amp; Philosophy'' (New York: Cornell University Press 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
Carolyn Korsmeyer, M. Quinet and Glenn Kuehn argue for including food among aesthetically relevant objects and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Quinet, M.L. 1981. “Food as Art: The Problem of Function”. ''British Journal of Aesthetic''s. 21, 1: 159-171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn, Glenn "How Can Food Be Art?" in Light, Andrew &amp; Smith, Jonathan M. (eds.) ''The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (New York: Columbia University Press. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

== The categories of the ordinary as aesthetic ==
Another line emerging from analytic aesthetics and the American Society of Aesthetics has been lately discussing the expansion of aesthetics’ category repertoire to include other qualities (cuteness, prettiness, messiness, neatness, cuddleness loveliness, organized, disorganized)&lt;ref&gt;Leddy, Thomas. 1995. 'Everyday Surface Aesthetic Qualities: "Neat", "Messy", "Clean", "Dirty"'''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', 53, 259-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Leddy, Thomas''The Extraordinary in the Ordinary: The Aesthetics of Everyday Life'' (Broadview Press 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other types of ordinary experiences (i.e. scratching an itch, playing with a pencil).&lt;ref&gt;Irvin,Sherri “Scratching an Itch,” Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 66, 1 (2008), 25-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exploitation fiction''' is a type of [[literature]] that includes [[novel]]s and [[magazine]]s that [[wikt:exploitation|exploit]] [[sex]], [[violence]], [[drug]]s, or other elements meant to attract readers primarily by arousing prurient interest without being labeled as [[obscene]] or [[pornography|pornographic]].

Exploitation fiction grew out of [[Pulp fiction (genre)|pulp fiction]] of the 1930s and 1940s. It was popular "trash fiction" in the form of [[mass market paperback]]s in the 1950s and 1960s, when genuine, sexually explicit material could be seized as obscene. In the [[United States]], material that went by [[U.S. Postal Service|U.S. mail]] was subject to federal obscenity laws that greatly curtailed the distribution of materials that were sexually explicit or featured graphic violence. These cheap novels exploited violence, drugs, and sex—especially promiscuity and [[lesbianism]]—but rarely delivered the kind of salacious detail their cover art implied and generally tacked on moralistic endings to satisfy critics who accused them of having "no redeeming social value." They were often repackaged under new titles with different cover art, to resell to the unsuspecting public looking for cheap thrills.

As [[Motion Picture Production Code|film production codes]] loosened in the early 1960s, exploitation fiction led to [[exploitation film|exploitation cinema]] (again parallel to the development of ''giallo'' cinema), typified by [[Russ Meyer]] films.

[[File:Coat of Arms of the Diocese of St Davids.svg|thumb|165x165px|Arms of the Diocese of St. David's, Sable, (a cross Or with five cinquefoils sable).  The arms, lacking cinquefoils, forms the basis of the flag.]]
The '''flag of Saint David''' ({{lang-cy|Baner Dewi Sant}}) is normally a yellow cross on a black field, but it has also appeared as a black cross on a yellow field or with an [[Line (heraldry)#Engrailed and invected|engrailed]] cross. It represents the 6th-century [[Saint David]] ({{lang-cy|Dewi Sant}}; {{circa|500}} – {{circa|589}}), a Welsh [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Menevia|bishop of Menevia]] and the [[patron saint]] of [[Wales]].

The Flag of Saint David has been used as a flag representing [[Wales]] (as an alternative to the [[Flag of Wales|Red Dragon]] flag), in the same sense that the crosses of [[St George's Cross|Saint George]], [[flag of Scotland|Saint Andrew]] and [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|Saint Patrick]] are used to represent [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]] (of which they are respectively [[patron saint]]s). It is similar to the arms of the [[Diocese of St David's]].

The flag can be seen throughout Wales, but not as frequently as the [[Flag of Wales|Red Dragon]]. On [[Saint David's Day]] it often plays a central role in the celebrations.

== History ==
[[File:St Davids Day in Cardiff.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The flag of Saint David ''(right)'' alongside the flag of Wales ''(left)'' on [[Saint David's Day]].]]
The flag of Saint David was mostly unknown in Wales until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-w-std.html|title=St. Davids Flag (Wales)|website=www.crwflags.com|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a large one along the roof in [[St David's Cathedral]] with the [[Charge (heraldry)#Plants|cinquefoils]] thereon but hardly any others in use. The Welsh Tartan Company (WTC){{who|date=April 2015}} were looking around for a 'brand' to complete the ''Brithwe Dewi Sant'' (St David's Tartan). J Wake, then of the WTC, set out to see if the flag could be used commercially or indeed patriotically across Wales. The feeling at the time was that the Union flag did not contain any Welshness, the [[St George's Cross]] representing Wales as a principality of [[England]]. The Dean of St David's said that the cinquefoil and the cross were their property and advised help from a London royal official office.

The WTC was then told the Prince of Wales probably owned the rights to the flag and may not give permission. There was neither outright animosity to the flag being produced and used, nor any enthusiasm. It was decided, after a lawyer was consulted, that the flag could be used as long as there were no cinquefoils on it. A thousand flags were produced without the cinquefoils; they were distributed around Wales and a PR campaign took place to increase knowledge of the St David's flag.

The flags were hung prominently in the Welsh shop in the centre of Cardiff and at other locations. Within 10 years, the St David's Flag was known and flown across Wales in patriotic use. It was never a flag to usurp the Red Dragon but to complement it, and perhaps to get Wales's own Patron Saint's emblem to proudly fly alongside the emblems of the other nations, St George, St Andrew and St Patrick.

== Uses ==
The history of the flag is somewhat obscure, but it seems to have emerged at the beginning of the 20th century. One theory is that it was developed to fly atop [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches in Wales (possibly with colours reversed as a black cross on a yellow field) in the same way that the [[St George's Cross]] was flown outside churches in [[England]], but since 1954 churches are more likely to fly a [[flag of the Church in Wales]]  based on its armorial badge granted that year.

In any case, the colours of the flag, black and gold, have certainly long been associated with the Welsh saint, even if not always in the form of a symmetrical cross. St David's University College, [[Lampeter]] (now the Lampeter campus of the [[University of Wales Trinity Saint David]]), founded in 1822, adopted these colours as the 'college colours' in 1888,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Price | first = DT William | location = Cardiff | title = A History of Saint David's University College, Lampeter | volume = 1 | publisher = [[University of Wales Press]] | isbn = 978-0-7083-0606-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the flag of St David continues to be associated with the college, and is often flown today in a form defaced to include the cinquefoils of the crest of St David's College.

A stylized version of the flag was also used as the shoulder badge of the [[38th (Welsh) Infantry Division]] during [[World War II]].

Between 2003 and 2008, [[Cardiff City F.C.]] incorporated the flag into their logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cardiff City|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Cardiff_City/Cardiff_City.htm|work=Historical Football Kits|accessdate=26 March 2013|first=Dave|last=Moor}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crusaders Rugby League|Crusaders]] RLFC, who started playing [[rugby league]] in [[Bridgend]] in 2006, also incorporated the flag on their logo.

In 2007 [[George Hargreaves (politician)|George Hargreaves]], leader of the [[Christian Party (UK)|Welsh Christian Party]], campaigned to replace the [[Flag of Wales]] with the St David's Cross, claiming that the [[Welsh Dragon|red dragon]] on the Welsh flag was "nothing less than the sign of Satan".&lt;ref&gt;Molly Watson, "[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/christian-group-wants-evil-welsh-2263878 Christian group wants 'evil' Welsh flag changed]" ''Western Mail'', 3 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gathering''' is a [[sewing]] technique for shortening the length of a strip of [[textile|fabric]] so that the longer piece can be attached to a shorter piece. It is commonly used in [[clothing]] to manage fullness{{Clarify|date=March 2014}}, as when a full [[sleeve]] is attached to the [[armscye]] or [[cuff]] of a [[dress shirt|shirt]], or when a [[skirt]] is attached to a [[bodice]].

In simple gathering, [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] rows of [[running stitch]]es are sewn along one edge of the fabric to be gathered.  The stitching [[Thread (yarn)|threads]] are then pulled or "drawn up" so that the fabric forms small folds along the threads.&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield, S.F.A. and B.C. Saward, ''The Dictionary of Needlework'', 1885, facsimile edition, Blaketon Hall, 1989, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Picken, Mary Brooks: ''The Fashion Dictionary'', Funk and Wagnalls, 1957.  (1973 edition {{ISBN|0-308-10052-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gathering seams once involved tedious hand sewing of [[Tack (sewing)|basting]], which was time consuming and inefficient, especially with heavy fabric. Now, a quick and easy way to make a gather is to use a wide [[zigzag stitch]] with a [[sewing machine]]. Both the upper and lower thread are pulled long and placed in front of the sewing machine. Then zigzagging is carefully sewed over top of the two threads without catching the threads as it is sewn. At the end the thread is pulled and is then gathered.  &lt;ref&gt;LovetoSew.com ''Garment Construction: How to Gather Fabric''  http://www.lovetosew.com/seamgathering.htm Retrieved on 2011-12-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=  https://teachyoutosew.com/sewing-fabric-101/|title= Sewing Fabric Guide }} Wednesday, November 21, 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gathering Technique.jpg|thumb|This photo shows a quick and easy method of machine gathering. This zigzag gathering technique is the strongest and most sturdy method of [http://www.lovetosew.com/seamgathering.htm gathering].]]

==Types==

*'''Pleating''' or '''plaiting''' is a type of gathering in which the folds are usually larger, made by hand and pinned in place, rather than drawn up on threads, but very small pleats are often identical to evenly spaced gathers. Pleating is mainly used to make skirts, but can have other uses.(See main article [[Pleat]].)&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield and Saward, ''The Dictionary of Needlework''&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Shirring''' or '''gauging''' is a decorative technique in which a panel of fabric is gathered with many rows of stitching across its entire length and then attached to a foundation or lining to hold the gathers in place. It is very commonly used to make larger pieces of clothing with some shape to them.&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield and Saward, ''The Dictionary of Needlework'', p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''(Great) Book of Lecan''' (Irish: '''''Leabhar (Mór) Leacain''''') ([[Royal Irish Academy|RIA]], MS '''23 P 2''') is a [[medieval]] [[Ireland|Irish]] [[manuscript]] written between [[1397 in Ireland|1397]] and  [[1418 in Ireland|1418]] in Castle Forbes, Lecan (Lackan, Leckan; Irish ''Leacan'') in the territory of [[Tír Fhíacrach Múaidhe|Tír Fhíacrach]], near modern [[Enniscrone]], [[County Sligo]]. It is in the possession of the [[Royal Irish Academy]].&lt;ref name="Jones' Celtic Encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/jce/greatlecan.html Jones' Celtic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Leabhar Mór Leacain'' is written in [[Middle Irish language|Middle Irish]] and was created by [[Ádhamh Ó Cuirnín]] for [[Giolla Íosa Mór Mac Fhirbhisigh]].  The material within was transcribed from the [[Book of Leinster]], latter copies of the [[Book of Invasions]], the [[dinsenchas]], the [[banshenchas]] and the [[Lebor na gCeart|Book of Rights]].&lt;ref name="Jones' Celtic Encyclopedia"/&gt;

At one stage it was owned by [[James Ussher]]. [[James II of England]] then deposited it at the [[Irish College, Paris]]. In 1787, the Chevalier O'Reilly returned it to Ireland; where it was at one stage in the possession of [[Charles Vallancey]]. He passed it on to the [[Royal Irish Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Frances Cusack, ‘’An Illustrated History of Ireland’’ Project Gutenberg eBook&lt;/ref&gt;

There were originally 30 folios; the first nine were apparently lost in 1724. These contained a large section devoted to the pedigrees and history of the [[Norsemen|Norse]] and [[Norse-Gaelic]] families of Ireland, which are nowhere else preserved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Bugge]] (ed. &amp; tr.), of [[Duald Mac Firbis]], ''[https://archive.org/details/onfomoriansnorse00macfuoft On the Fomorians and the Norsemen]''.

The pages are covered in a greasy substance which makes them transparent and reduces their legibility.&lt;ref name="Jones' Celtic Encyclopedia"/&gt;

"'''Hey Kid, Catch!'''" was a [[television advertisement|television commercial]] for [[Coca-Cola]] starring [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] defensive tackle [[Joe Greene|"Mean" Joe Greene]].   The commercial debuted on October 1, 1979, and was re-aired multiple times, most notably during [[Super Bowl XIV]] in 1980. The 60-second commercial won a [[Clio Award]] for being one of the best television commercials of 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-10-best-award-winning-tv-ads-everyone-must-see-2011-1?op=1|title=The 10 Best Award-Winning TV Ads Everyone Must See|date=January 18, 2011|website=Business Insider|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its planning and filming stages, [[McCann Erickson]], the advertising agency that created the commercial, used the working title "Mean Joe Greene".  The commercial was a part of Coca-Cola's "Have a Coke and a Smile" ad campaign of the late 1970s.  The commercial's set-up and payoff is classic simple advertising.

==The Commercial==
After sustaining an injury during a football game, Greene is limping alone into the tunnel toward the Steelers' locker room when a young boy (played by Tommy Okon) comes up behind him offering his help, which Greene declines.  After telling Greene that he still thinks he's the best, the boy offers him his bottle of Coke, which Greene refuses at first, but the boy wants him to have it; Greene sheepishly accepts it with thanks and drinks the entire bottle as the boy quietly says "See ya 'round" and slowly walks away.  When Greene finishes the Coke he turns back to the boy and says "Hey, Kid..  Catch,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xffOCZYX6F8|title=Coca-Cola Classic ad: Mean Joe Greene [Full Version] (1979)|date=July 17, 2007|website=YouTube|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; tossing his jersey (slung over his shoulder) to the surprised boy who happily says "Wow!  Thanks, Mean Joe!".  Greene casts a smile toward the boy before continuing his trek to the locker room.

The commercial has been listed as one of the top ads of all time by multiple sources, including ''[[TV Guide]]''. The ad later received worldwide acclaim when it was re-filmed in various countries using indigenous sports figures in each version.  

The campaign's art director was Roger Mosconi, the writer was Penny Hawkey, and the singers of the "Coke and a Smile" jingle were Jim Campbell, Don Thomas, Liz Corrigan, Shellie Littman, Arlene Martell, and [[Linda November]]. The footage was shot in May 1979 at a small stadium in [[Mount Vernon, New York]], and the commercial first aired on October 1, 1979 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', though its airing during Super Bowl XIV in 1980 brought it the most attention due to the program's enormous audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=December 17, 1979|last=Isaacs|first=Stan|title=Mean Joe: Goliath plays Othello|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1126412/1/index.htm|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=At the request of the singers in the audience, Arlene sang "A Coke and a Smile", a classic jingle with Mean Joe Green which has played every year for a decade on ''Super Bowl's Greatest Commercials'', and in 2009 was voted into the Super Bowl Hall of Fame. Singers on the commercial are Jim Campbell, Don Thomas, Liz Corrigan, Shellie Littman, Arlene Martell, and Linda November|title=Singers' Seminar explores steps to success|url=http://www.aftra.org/documents/FALL2010_STAND_FINAL%281%29.pdf|format=pdf|date=Fall 2010|volume=43|number=2|website=[[AFTRA]]|location=New York|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greene later recalled that in filming the commercial, it took several takes to get his final line in the commercial in without burping. "Between me belching and going to the men's room, it took three days to film it," Greene recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fowler|first1=Scott|title=Mean Joe Greene's biggest hit was also his most memorable 'catch'|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-03-01/sports/1992061149_1_joe-greene-okon-coke|accessdate=January 3, 2017|work=Baltimore Sun|date=March 1, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the commercial was also shown during the 2004 film [[Miracle (2004 film)|Miracle]] when the USA vs. USSR hockey game was on a commercial break.

==Parodies and homages==
*In 1983, the television show "Newhart" paid homage to the commercial in the first season episode "A View from the Bench" when a limping Celtics player throws his basketball shoes to Bob Newhart on his way to the locker room.

* During [[Super Bowl XLIII]] in 2009, Coca-Cola aired a parody to the ad to promote its [[Coca-Cola Zero]] brand, starring former Steelers player [[Troy Polamalu]] in Greene's role. Continuing an ongoing theme in promotion for the beverage, the ad is interrupted by Coca-Cola "brand managers" who accuse Polamalu of "stealing" their commercial, prompting the [[safety (gridiron football position)|safety]] to tackle one of them and give the child their shirt.&lt;ref name=freep-09ads&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinds|first=Julie|title=Super Bowl ads deliver big laughs|url=http://archive.freep.com/article/20090202/ENT03/902020367/Super-Bowl-ads-deliver-big-laughs|website=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=March 20, 2015|date=February 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abchron-meanjoezero&gt;{{cite web|title=Coke to reprise 'Mean Joe' commercial for Super Bowl|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2009/01/26/daily11.html|website=Atlanta Business Chronicle|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, an episode of ''[[SportsNation (TV series)|SportsNation]]'' on [[ESPN2]] briefly parodied this commercial which featured sportscaster [[Michelle Beadle]] in Greene's role. In the commercial, after finishing the soda, instead of the jersey, she "accidentally" throws the empty soda bottle back to the child as it breaks on the wall at the end and then apologizes after that "mishap". In addition, the commercial tried to look like the late 70s/early 80s font titles with the words "Facebook.com/SportsNation" and "Have Some ''"SportsNation"'' and a smile" and "Sports is Life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Davis | first=Glenn | url=http://www.sportsgrid/com/real-sport/nfl/videos-espns-Michelle-beadle-shoots-some-super-bowl-commercials/ |title=ESPN'S Michelle Beadle Shoots Some Super Bowl Commercials (Mean Joe Greene is mentioned in the article)| date=January 31, 2011 | accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An advertisement for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television drama series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', first aired during [[Super Bowl XLV]], parodies the original commercial with a similar scene in which Dr. Gregory House, played by [[Hugh Laurie]], throws his cane to a young fan played by [[Preston Bailey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailyastorian.com/news/free/article_f4a618f2-2fe8-11e0-a807-001cc4c002e0.html | title=Former Seaside boy set to appear in Super Bowl commercial Sunday | date=February 4, 2011 | website=The Daily Astorian | accessdate=February 7, 2011 | location=Astoria, Oregon | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206235639/http://www.dailyastorian.com/news/free/article_f4a618f2-2fe8-11e0-a807-001cc4c002e0.html | archivedate=February 6, 2011 | df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012, Greene reprised his role in a [[Downy]] Unstopables ad for [[Super Bowl XLVI]] entitled "Stinky", where [[Amy Sedaris]] rejects Greene's jersey because it smelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=McManis | first=Andrew |  url=http://adweeek.com/brand-marketing/cokes-classic-super-bowl-ad-gets-stinky-137882 | title=Coke's Classic Super Bowl Ad Gets 'Stinky' | date=January 31, 2012 | accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historicism''' is the idea of attributing meaningful significance to space and time, such as historical period, geographical place, and local culture. Historicism tends to be [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or [[relativism|relativist]], because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, Jeffrey. "Historicism." ''Renaissance Quarterly'', vol. 50, no. 4 December 22, 1997, p. 1202&lt;/ref&gt; The approach varies from individualist theories of knowledge such as [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]], which neglect the role of [[tradition]]s.

The term "historicism" (''Historismus'') was coined by German philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leiter, Michael Rosen (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 175: "[The word 'historicism'] appears as early as the late eighteenth century in the writings of the German romantics, who used it in a neutral sense. In 1797 Friedrich Schlegel used 'historicism' to refer to a philosophy that stresses the importance of history..."; Katherine Harloe, Neville Morley (eds.), ''Thucydides and the Modern World: Reception, Reinterpretation and Influence from the Renaissance to the Present'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 81: "Already in   Friedrich Schlegel's ''Fragments about Poetry and Literature'' (a collection of notes attributed to 1797), the word ''Historismus'' occurs five times."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time it has developed different and somewhat divergent meanings. Elements of historicism appear in the writings of French essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592) and Italian philosopher [[G. B. Vico]] (1668–1744), and became more fully developed with the [[dialectic]] of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Georg Hegel]] (1770–1831), influential in 19th-century Europe. The writings of [[Karl Marx]], influenced by Hegel, also include historicism. The term is also associated with the empirical social sciences and with the work of [[Franz Boas]].

Historicism may be contrasted with [[reductionism|reductionist]] theories—which assumes that all developments can be explained by fundamental principles (such as in [[economic determinism]])—or with theories that posit that historical changes occur as a result of random chance.

The Austrian-English philosopher [[Karl Popper]] condemned historicism along with the [[determinism]] and [[holism]] which he argued formed its basis. In his ''[[Poverty of Historicism]]'', he identified historicism with the opinion that there are "inexorable laws of historical destiny", which opinion he warned against. This contrasts with the contextually relative interpretation of historicism for which its proponents argue. [[Talcott Parsons]] criticized historicism as a case of idealistic fallacy in ''The Structure of Social Action'' (1937).

[[Post-structuralism]] uses the term "[[New Historicism]]", which has some associations with both anthropology and Hegelianism.

The [[#Christian historicism|theological use]] of the word denotes the interpretation of biblical prophecy as being related to church history.

===Hegelian===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|right|thumb|G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831)]]

Hegel viewed the realization of human freedom as the ultimate purpose of history, which could only be achieved through the creation of the perfect state. And this progressive history would only occur through a dialectical process: namely, the tension between the purpose of humankind (freedom), the position that humankind currently finds itself, and mankind's attempt to bend the current world into accord with its nature. However, because humans are often not aware of the goal of both humanity and history, the process of achieving freedom is necessarily one of self-discovery. Hegel also saw the progress toward freedom being conducted by the "spirit" (Geist), a seemingly supernatural force that directed all human actions and interactions. Yet Hegel makes clear that the spirit is a mere abstraction, and only comes into existence "through the activity of finite agents." Thus, Hegel's philosophy of history is not necessarily metaphysical, despite the fact that many of Hegel's opponents and interpreters have understood Hegel's philosophy of history as a metaphysical and determinist view of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Cambridge University PRess|year=1993|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=289–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Karl Popper in his book ''The Poverty of Historicism'' interpreted Hegel's philosophy of history as metaphysical and deterministic. Popper referred to this "Hegelian" philosophy of history as ''Historicism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Poverty of Historicism|last=Popper|first=Karl Popper|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1957|isbn=|location=London|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's historicism also suggests that any human [[society]] and all human activities such as [[science]], [[art]], or [[philosophy]], are defined by their history. Consequently, their essence can be sought only by understanding said history. The history of any such human endeavor, moreover, not only continues but also reacts against what has gone before; this is the source of Hegel's famous dialectic teaching usually summarized by the slogan "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis, antithesis, and synthesis]]".  (Hegel did not use these terms, although [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johann Fichte]] did.) Hegel's famous [[aphorism]], "Philosophy is the history of philosophy," describes it bluntly.

Hegel's position is perhaps best illuminated when contrasted against the atomistic and reductionist opinion of human societies and social activities self-defining on an ''ad hoc'' basis through the sum of dozens of interactions. Yet another contrasting model is the persistent metaphor of a [[social contract]].  Hegel considers the relationship between individuals and societies as organic, not atomic: even their social discourse is mediated by [[philosophy of language|language]], and language is based on [[etymology]] and unique character. It thus preserves the culture of the past in thousands of half-forgotten [[metaphor]]s.  To understand why a person is the way he is, you must examine that person in his society: and to understand that society, you must understand its history, and the forces that influenced it.  The ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', the "Spirit of the Age," is the concrete embodiment of the most important factors that are acting in human history at any given time. This contrasts with teleological theories of activity, which suppose that the end is the determining factor of activity, as well as those who believe in a [[tabula rasa]], or blank slate, opinion, such that individuals are defined by their interactions.

These ideas can be interpreted variously.  The [[Right Hegelians]], working from Hegel's opinions about the organicism and historically determined nature of human societies, interpreted Hegel's historicism as a justification of the unique destiny of national groups and the importance of stability and institutions.  Hegel's conception of human societies as entities greater than the individuals who constitute them influenced nineteenth-century [[romantic nationalism]] and its twentieth-century excesses.  The [[Young Hegelians]], by contrast, interpreted Hegel's thoughts on societies influenced by social conflict for a doctrine of [[social progress]], and attempted to manipulate these forces to cause various  results.  Karl Marx's doctrine of "historical inevitabilities" and [[historical materialism]] is one of the more influential reactions to this part of Hegel's thought.  Significantly, Karl Marx's [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]] argues that [[capitalism]] disrupts traditional relationships between workers and their work.

Hegelian historicism is related to his ideas on the means by which human societies progress, specifically the [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic]] and his conception of logic as representing the inner essential nature of reality. Hegel attributes the change to the "modern" need to interact with the world, whereas ancient philosophers were self-contained, and medieval philosophers were monks. In his History of Philosophy Hegel writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In modern times things are very different; now we no longer see philosophic individuals who constitute a class by themselves. With the present day all difference has disappeared; philosophers are not monks, for we find them generally in connection with the world, participating with others in some common work or calling. They live, not independently, but in the relation of citizens, or they occupy public offices and take part in the life of the state. Certainly they may be private persons, but if so, their position as such does not in any way isolate them from their other relationship. They are involved in present conditions, in the world and its work and progress. Thus their philosophy is only by the way, a sort of luxury and superfluity. This difference is really to be found in the manner in which outward conditions have taken shape after the building up of the inward world of religion. In modern times, namely, on account of the reconciliation of the worldly principle with itself, the external world is at rest, is brought into order — worldly relationships, conditions, modes of life, have become constituted and organized in a manner which is conformable to nature and rational. We see a universal, comprehensible connection, and with that individuality likewise attains another character and nature, for it is no longer the plastic individuality of the ancients. This connection is of such power that every individuality is under its dominion, and yet at the same time can construct for itself an inward world.&lt;ref name=LecturesOnTheHistoryOfPhilosophyVolume3&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Lectures_on_the_History_of_Philosophy.html?id=ik05WhN4ga0C&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Volume 3"], By Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Translated by E. S. Haldane and Frances H. Simson, M. A., ''University of Nebraska Press'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This opinion that entanglement in society creates an indissoluble bond with expression, would become an influential question in philosophy, namely, the requirements for individuality.  It would be considered by [[Nietzsche]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Michel Foucault]] directly, as well as in the work of numerous artists and authors. There have been various responses to Hegel's challenge. The Romantic period emphasized the ability of individual genius to transcend time and place, and use the materials from their heritage to fashion works which were beyond determination. The modern would advance versions of John Locke's infinite malleability of the human animal. Post-structuralism would argue that since history is not present, but only the image of history, that while an individual era or power structure might emphasize a particular history, that the contradictions within the story would hinder the very purposes that the history was constructed to advance.

===Anthropological&lt;!--'Anthropological historicism'--&gt;===
In the context of [[anthropology]] and other sciences which study the past, historicism has a different meaning. '''Anthropological historicism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byron Kaldis (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences'', SAGE Publications, 2013, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with the work of [[Franz Boas]]. His theory used the [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusionist]] concept that there were a few "cradles of civilization" which grew outwards, and merged it with the idea that societies would adapt to their circumstances, which is called [[historical particularism]]. The school of historicism grew in response to [[Classical social evolutionism|unilinear theories]] that social development represented adaptive fitness, and therefore existed on a continuum. While these theories were espoused by [[Charles Darwin]] and many of his students, their application as applied in [[social Darwinism]] and [[general evolution]] characterized in the theories of [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Leslie White]], historicism was neither anti-selection, nor anti-evolution, as Darwin never attempted nor offered an explanation for cultural evolution. However, it attacked the notion that there was one normative spectrum of development, instead emphasizing how local conditions would create adaptations to the local environment. [[Julian Steward]] refuted the viability of globally and universally applicable adaptive standards proposing that culture was honed adaptively in response to the idiosyncrasies of the local environment, the [[cultural ecology]], by [[specific evolution]]. What was adaptive for one region might not be so for another. This conclusion has likewise been adopted by modern forms of biological evolutionary theory.

The primary method of historicism was empirical, namely that there were so many requisite inputs into a society or event, that only by emphasizing the data available could a theory of the source be determined. In this opinion, grand theories are unprovable, and instead intensive field work would determine the most likely explanation and history of a culture, and hence it is named "historicism."

This opinion would produce a wide range of definition of what, exactly, constituted culture and history, but in each case the only means of explaining it was in terms of the historical particulars of the culture itself.

===New===
{{main|New Historicism}}
Since the 1950s, when [[Jacques Lacan]] and Foucault argued that each epoch has its own knowledge system, within which individuals are inexorably entangled, many [[post-structuralist]]s have used ''historicism'' to describe the opinion that all questions must be settled within the cultural and social context in which they are raised. Answers cannot be found by appeal to an external truth, but only within the confines of the norms and forms that phrase the question.  This version of historicism holds that there are only the raw texts, markings and artifacts that exist in the present, and the conventions used to decode them. This school of thought is sometimes given the name of ''New Historicism''.

The same term, ''new historicism'' is also used for a school of literary scholarship which interprets a [[poem]], [[drama]], etc. as an expression of or reaction to the power-structures of its society. [[Stephen Greenblatt]] is an example of this school.

===Modern===
Within the context of 20th-century philosophy, debates continue as to whether ahistorical and immanent methods were sufficient to understand meaning—that is to say, "what you see is what you get" positivism—or whether context, background and culture are important beyond the mere need to decode words, phrases and references. While post-structural historicism is relativist in its orientation, that is, it sees each culture as its own frame of reference, a large number of thinkers have embraced the need for historical context, not because culture is self-referential, but because there is no more compressed means of conveying all of the relevant information except through history. This opinion is often seen as deriving from the work of [[Benedetto Croce]]. Recent historians using this tradition include [[Thomas Kuhn]].

===Christian===
{{main|Historicism (Christian eschatology)}}

====Eschatological====
In [[Christianity]], the term ''historicism'' refers to the confessional [[Protestantism|Protestant]] form of prophetical interpretation which holds that the fulfillment of [[Bible|biblical]] [[prophecy]] has occurred throughout history and continues to occur; as opposed to other methods which limit the time-frame of prophecy-fulfillment to the past or to the future.

====Dogmatic and ecclesiastic====
There is also a particular opinion in [[ecclesiastical history]] and in the [[History of Catholic dogmatic theology|history of dogmas]] which has been described as historicist by Pope [[Pius XII]] in the encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]''. "They add that the history of dogmas consists in the reporting of the various forms in which revealed truth has been clothed, forms that have succeeded one another in accordance with the different teachings and opinions that have arisen over the course of the centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |title=Humani generis, 15 |publisher=[[Vatican.va]] |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419021937/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |archivedate=2012-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==

===Karl Marx===
The social theory of Karl Marx, with respect to modern scholarship, has an ambiguous relation to historicism. Critics of Marx have charged his theory with historicism since its very genesis. However, the issue of historicism also finds itself important to many debates within Marxism itself; the charge of historicism has been made against various types of Marxism, typically disparaged by Marxists as "vulgar" Marxism.

Marx himself expresses critical concerns with this historicist tendency in his [[Theses on Feuerbach]]:
{{quote|The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of changed circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change [Selbstveränderung] can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary [[praxis (process)|practice]].&lt;ref name="Theses on Feuerbach"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm | title = Theses on Feuerbach | website = | publisher = | accessdate = February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Karl Popper===

[[Karl Popper]] used the term ''historicism'' in his influential books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', to mean: "an approach to the social sciences which assumes that ''historical prediction'' is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns', the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history".&lt;ref name = "Poverty 3"&gt;POPPER, Karl, p. 3 of ''The Poverty of Historicism'', italics in original&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Popper wrote with reference to [[Hegel]]'s theory of [[history]], which he criticized extensively. However, there is wide dispute whether Popper's description of "historicism" is an accurate description of Hegel, or more his characterisation of his own philosophical antagonists, including [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought, then widely held as posing a challenge to the philosophical basis of the [[Western world|West]], as well as theories such as [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] which drew predictions about the future course of events from the past.

In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Popper attacks "historicism" and its proponents, among whom (as well as Hegel) he identifies and singles out [[Plato]] and [[Marx]]—calling them all "enemies of the open society".  The objection he makes is that historicist positions, by claiming that there is an inevitable and deterministic pattern to history, abrogate the [[democracy|democratic]] responsibility of each one of us to make our own free contributions to the evolution of society, and hence lead to [[totalitarianism]].

Another of his targets is what he terms "moral historicism", the attempt to infer moral values from the course of history; in Hegel's words, that "history is the world's court of justice".  This may take the form of conservatism (former might is right), positivism (might is right) or futurism (presumed coming might is right). As against these, Popper says that he does not believe "that success proves anything or that history is our judge".&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Society and its Enemies'', vol. 2 p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Futurism must be distinguished from prophecies that the right will prevail: these attempt to infer history from ethics, rather than ethics from history, and are therefore historicism in the normal sense rather than moral historicism.

He also attacks what he calls "[[Historism]]", which he regards as distinct from historicism.  By historism, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits.  In Popperian terms, the "[[New Historicism]]" is an example of historism rather than of historicism proper.

===Leo Strauss===
[[Leo Strauss]] used the term ''historicism'' and reportedly termed it the single greatest threat to intellectual freedom insofar as it denies any attempt to address injustice-pure-and-simple (such is the significance of historicism's rejection of "natural right" or "right by nature").  Strauss argued that historicism "rejects political philosophy" (insofar as this stands or falls by questions of permanent, trans-historical significance) and is based on the belief that "all human thought, including scientific thought, rests on premises which cannot be validated by human reason and which came from historical epoch to historical epoch." Strauss further identified [[R. G. Collingwood]] as the most coherent advocate of historicism in the English language.  Countering Collingwood's arguments, Strauss warned against historicist social scientists' failure to address real-life problems—most notably that of tyranny—to the extent that they relativize (or "subjectivize") all ethical problems by placing their significance strictly in function of particular or ever-changing socio-material conditions devoid of inherent or "objective" "value." Similarly, Strauss criticized [[Eric Voegelin]]'s abandonment of ancient political thought as guide or vehicle in interpreting modern political problems.

In his books, ''[[Natural Right and History]]'' and ''[[On Tyranny]]'', Strauss offers a complete critique of historicism as it emerges in the works of Hegel, Marx, and [[Heidegger]]. Many believe that Strauss also found historicism in [[Edmund Burke]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Augustine]], and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Although it is largely disputed whether Strauss himself was a historicist, he often indicated that historicism grew out of and against Christianity and was a threat to civic participation, belief in human agency, religious pluralism, and, most controversially, an accurate understanding of the classical philosophers and religious prophets themselves. Throughout his work, he warns that historicism, and the understanding of [[Progress (history)|progress]] that results from it, expose us to [[tyranny]], totalitarianism, and [[Ochlocracy|democratic extremism]]. In his exchange with [[Alexandre Kojève]] in ''On Tyranny'', Strauss seems to blame historicism for [[Nazism]] and [[Communism]]. In a collection of his works by Kenneth Hart entitled ''[[Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity]]'',  he argues that [[Islam]], traditional [[Judaism]], and ancient Greece, share a concern for sacred law that makes them especially susceptible to historicism, and therefore to tyranny.  Strauss makes use of Nietzsche's own critique of progress and historicism, although Strauss refers to Nietzsche himself (no less than to Heidegger) as a "radical historicist" who articulated a philosophical (if only untenable) justification for historicism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4492">[[Image:Nazca-pottery-(01).png|right|thumb|[[Nazca culture]] huaco, [[double spout and bridge vessel]] representing an [[orca]]. ]]
[[File:MochePortrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|Moche Portrait pot. This fine pot appears to represent a good-humored Moche man.]]
'''Huaco''' or '''Guaco''' is the generic name given in [[Peru]] mostly to earthen vessels and other finely made [[ceramic art|pottery artworks]] by the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] found in [[pre-Columbian]] sites such as burial locations, sanctuaries, temples and other ancient ruins. Huacos are not mere [[earthenware]] but notable pottery specimens linked to ceremonial, religious, artistic or aesthetic uses in central [[Andes|Andean]], pre-Columbian civilizations.

The [[Huari culture|Huari]] (Wari), along with the [[Nazca culture|Nazca]], the [[Moche culture|Moche]] and others, were among the major creators of figurines who passed down through history their unique skills in ceramics. The Incas, who absorbed all the cultures in the time of its expansion, also produced huacos.

==Etymology==
Since the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]], these types of pieces have been found in pre-Columbian sites like [[temple]]s, [[Grave (burial)|graves]] and burials, as well as other kinds of [[ruin]]s. These sites, especially if they are of a sacred meaning, are called generic '''[[huaca]]''' or ''waqa'' in native [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], where it is likely that the figurines take their name. In Peru, a '''huaquero''' is a person that digs in ancient [[pre-Columbian]] ruins illegally in order to get valuable pieces of artwork, usually destroying the structure.

==Variety of styles and colors==
The bridge handles are characteristic of some cultures; some used many colors, while others used black and dull red or few colors.  [[Inca Empire]] adopted all sorts of shapes, styles and qualities. The term "huaco" was reserved for any copies not reserved for daily use but the luxury or ritual.

Normally these ceramic pieces are associated with notable features. Sculptured figurines depict complex, stylized volumes, including cultural scenes, buildings, and naturalistic volumes such as portrait ceramics representing human faces (for example, the [[Moche Portrait Ceramic]]) or body parts by way of [[votive offering]], erotica, tools, various fruits and foods, animals, etc.

When the pieces are sculptural ceramics, huacos are characterized by pictorial richness. There are many kinds of pots and containers covered with gaudy polychrome motifs, usually anthropomorphic representations of animals or mythological, erotica, etc. Two-toned [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] pottery is characterized by complex painted scenes detailing a narrative level. Examples of erotic huacos ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''huacos eróticos''), make the Moche's 800-year period (''c.'' 200 BC to ''c.'' 600 AD) the longest unbroken erotic ceramics tradition in the world, unique in the history of mankind.&lt;ref name="SexPot"&gt;{{Cite book | last= Mathieu | first= Paul |author2=Catherine Hess | title= Sex Pots: Eroticism in Ceramics | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q6oP8nM5EoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | accessdate= 1 December 2009 | origyear= 2003 | year= 2003 | publisher=  Rutgers University Press | location= New Brunswick, New Jersey | isbn=0-8135-3293-0 | page =22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1570s during the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]], [[Viceroy]] [[Francisco de Toledo]] and his clerical advisers worked to destroy many erotic huacos, though some extant artifacts have survived.

In both cases the huaco is associated with ceramic complexity (in its volume or decoration) and not with regular use as a container on account of  its physical dimensions. The slender Incan vessels known as ''aryballos'', even opulently created examples, are not usually considered ''huacos'' since their utilitarian character is too pronounced.

==Museum exhibits==
The [[National Museum of the Archaeology, Anthropology, and History of Peru]] in [[Lima, Peru]] houses a large number of ceramic artifacts. The nearby [[Larco Museum]] houses a large collection of Moche ceramics and is well known for its collection of erotic pottery.

The '''John Reed Clubs''' (1929-1935), often referred to as '''John Reed Club''' or JRC, were an [[United States|American]] federation of local organizations targeted towards [[Marxist]] writers, artists, and intellectuals, named after the American [[journalist]] and [[activist]] [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]]. Established in the fall of 1929, the John Reed Clubs were a [[mass organization]] of the [[Communist Party USA]] which sought to expand its influence among radical and liberal intellectuals. The organization was terminated in 1935.&lt;ref name=Alexandre&gt;

==History==

===1929===
[[file: New-Masses-FC-May-1926.jpg|thumb|right|''[[New Masses]]'' cover by [[Hugo Gellert]] (May 1926)]]
In October 1929, the '''John Reed Club''' was founded by eight staff members of the ''[[New Masses]]'' magazine to support leftist and Marxist artists and writers.  They included: [[Mike Gold]], [[Walt Carmon]], [[William Gropper]], Keene Wallis, [[Hugo Gellert]], Morris Pass, and Joseph Pass.&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt; 

According to [[Alan M. Wald]], The John Reed Clubs were not founded by the Communist Party. ''New Masses'' managing editor Walt Carmon became frustrated with a group of young writers who were hanging out in the office and getting in his way.&lt;ref name=Wald&gt;{{cite book|last=Wald|authorlink=Alan M. Wald|first=Alan|title=Exiles from a Future Time: The Forging of the Mid-Twentieth Century Literary Left|year=2002|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill and London|isbn=978-0-8078-5349-8|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told them to "go out and form a club" and "call it the John Reed Club."&lt;ref name=Wald /&gt; The John Reed Clubs would be a constant source of drama within the ''New Masses'' family, and members of the Clubs would eventually found the ''Partisan Review'', which became a main competitor to the ''New Masses''.

[[File:Gold-michael.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mike Gold]] (here, 1930s before crowd in New York City) was a prominent JRC co-founder]]
The ''New Masses'' announced the new club in its November 1929 issue:  &lt;blockquote&gt;The radical artists and writers of New York have organized the John Reed Club. The group includes all creative workers in art, literature, sculpture, music, theater, and the movies... &lt;br&gt; The purpose of the Club is to bring closer all creative workers; to maintain contact with the American revolutionary labor movement.&lt;br&gt;In cooperation with workers groups and cultural organizations, discussion, literary evenings, and exhibits will be organized. Hopefully, the organization will be national in scope... &lt;br&gt;For the first time, a group of socially conscious creative workers has been organized in America to compare with existing groups in Europe. Steps have been taken to make immediate contact with writers, artists, and all creative workers in France, Germany, Russia, and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;

In January 1930, [[Mike Gold]] described the JRC in the ''New Masses'' as a "small group" comprising writers, artists, sculptors, musicians, and dancers "of revolutionary tendencies."  They were already building a clubhouse.  Harold Hickerson had a music school with 100 pupils.  Gropper and Lozowick taught graphic arts to 30. Edith Siegel led a "worker's ballet" for a Lenin memorial. Em Jo Basshe directed a Jewish Workers' theatre.  Others taught at the [[New York Workers School]]. They cooperated with [[Workers International Relief]].  Gold recommended that every writer-member work in industry.  He cited as example Ed Falkowski (miner), Martin Russak (textile worker), H. H. Lewis (farmer), and Joe Kalar (lumberman).&lt;ref name=NM-1930-01&gt;

On May 19, 1930, the ''New York Times'' published "A protest against the imprisonment of men and women for expressing their political opinions, coupled with a warning that "Red-baiting" is rapidly becoming a permanent condition, was voiced in a statement issued yesterday by the John Reed Club.&lt;ref name=Red-Scare&gt;

In July 1930, Harry Alan Potemkin, JRC secretary, reported in the ''New Masses'' that the JRC had supported [[May Day]] as well as signed a petition for the [[International Labor Defense]] for prisoners of war.  The club also collaborated with "Proletpen," a Jewish proletarian writing group.  It also supported the "United Front Conference Against Lynching," created by the New York district of the [[Communist Party USA]].  Books published by member writers included: [[Charles Yale Harrison]]'s ''General Die in Bed'' and [[Mike Gold]]'s children's story ''Charlie Chaplin's Parde''.&lt;ref name=NM-1930-07&gt;

By November 1930, although originally politically independent, the JRC and the ''[[New Masses]]'' officially affiliated with the Communist Party.  This turn coincided with the JRC's participation in the Kharkov Conference of the International Union of Revolutionary Writers (IURW), November 6-15, 1930.  The joint JRC-''New Masses'' delegation included:  Mike Gold, A.B. Magil, Fred Ellis, William Gropper, Harry Potamkin, Josephine Herbst, and John Herrmann.  The conference led to a ten-point "Program of Action" to promote proletarian literature as an important part of promoting Marxism.&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt;  

===1932 ===
[[File:John dos Passos.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Dos Passos]] was a prominent writer and JRC member]]
On January 1, 1932, [[Diego Rivera]] spoke before the John Reed Club's New York chapter.  Later, when the JRC heard of Rivera's support for [[Leon Trotsky]], they disavowed him and returned a $100 contribution he made.&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt;

The JRCs held a national conference on May 29-30, 1932, in Chicago.&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt;  During the conference, the JRCs announced they were "an integral part of the "Workers Cultural Federation."&lt;ref name=NM-1932-07&gt;

Conference ("presidium") members elected included:  Joseph Freeman, Jan Wittenber, Conrad Kmorowiski, Kenneth Rexroth, Charles Natterstad, Harry Carlisle, George Gay, Carl Carlsen, and Jack Walters. Honorary members included [[Maxim Gorki]], Romain Rolland, [[John Dos Passos]], Fujimori, Lo Hsun, Johannes Becher, Vallant-Couturier, and [[Langston Hughes]], with [[Maurice Sugar]] as chairman and [[Oakley C. Johnson]] as secretary.&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt;  

Chapter reports consistently criticized the original New York City chapter of ignoring the others. Harry Carlisle of JRC Hollywood opposed Mike Gold of JRC NYC for falling down on principle when opening the JRC to non-Marxist writers and artists.  Instead, Carlisle urged, the JRC should focus on "artists and writers of distinctly working class origin."&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt;&lt;ref name=NM-1932-07/&gt; 

The July 1932 issue of the ''New Masses'' included the "John Reed Club Resolution Against War," stating its stance against "imminent imperial war," noting that the Soviet Union "stands for peace," and calling on all writers, artists, and professionals to unite "in defense of the first workers' republic, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics."&lt;ref&gt;

In November 1932, JRC members who publicly endorsed the Communist Party's [[United States presidential election, 1932|US presidential slate]] ([[William Z. Foster]] and [[James W. Ford]]) included:  EmJo Basshe, [[Robert Cantwell]], Orrik Johns, [[Grace Lumpkin]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Mike Gold]], and [[Louis Lozowick]].&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt;

===1933===

In early 1933, the JRCs took a strong stance against [[Hitler]] and the rising tide of [[Fascism]] in Europe.&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt;

In mid-1933, the JRCs held a second national conference.  Attendees include:  [[Jack Conroy]], Meridel Le Sueur, Alan Calmer, Orrick Johns, Joe Jones, Nelsen Algren, [[William Phillips (editor)|William Phillips]], [[Philip Rahv]], Alfred Hayes, Gilbert Rocke, Jan Wittenber, Mike Gold, Richard Wright, Alexander Trachtenberg, [[A.B. Magil]], Jack S. Balch, Joseph North.&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt;

===Dissolution===
In 1936, the John Reed Clubs dissolved into the [[American Artists' Congress]] by order of the Communist Party USA.&lt;ref name="marquardt"&gt;

==Organization==

The John Reed Club's slogan was "Art is a weapon in the class struggle."&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt;

===Headquarters===

In May 1930, the headquarters for the John Reed Club was 102 West [[14th Street (Manhattan)|Fourteenth Street]], New York City.&lt;ref name=Red-Scare/&gt;  In 1932, its location was 63 West [[15th Street (Manhattan)|Fifteenth Street]], New York City.&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt;&lt;ref name=NM-1932-07/&gt;

===Chapters===

New York City and Los Angeles were the two centers of writer-members.&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt;

In 1931, there were 13 JRC chapters.&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt; Chapters peaked at thirty. From New York, it spread to Chicago, Detroit, San Francisco, Boston, and other cities. The Boston chapter was cofounded by writer [[Eugene Gordon (writer)|Eugene Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizee, Andre.

===John Reed Club School of Art===

During the 1932 national convention, the JRCs announced the opening of a "John Reed Club School of Art" in New York City at 450 [[Sixth Avenue]].  Classes were to start on November 14, 1932, for Monday evenings and Saturday afternoons.  Instruction was open beyond JRC members.  Instructors included Hugo Gellert, William Gropper, Louis Lozowick, and William Siegel.&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt;

==People==

By 1933, the New York chapter had 380 members, of whom some 200 were artists and the rest writers.  The only paid job was secretary-treasurer at $15 per week.&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt;

==Assessment==

In her 1977 work ''The John Reed Clubs'', Laurie Ann Alexandre stated:  &lt;blockquote&gt;It would be inaccurate to call the John Reed Club a [[Marxist]] organization. Its charter simply stated that any member who recognized class struggle and wished to give it support would be welcomed. It cannot be said that the JRC was committed. beyond that general point. Many of its members were not Marxists, and the Clubs spent little time educating its members in the theoretical underpinnings of [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], or [[Lenin]].&lt;ref name=Alexandre/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* '''1929:''' The first art exhibition occurred at the United Workers' Cooperative Apartments (aka [https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/athomeinutopia/ United Workers Cooperative Colony], aka "Commie Coops") on [[Bronx Park|Bronx Park East]] in December 1929.  Artists included: [[Jacob Burck]], [[Fred Ellis (cartoonist)|Fred Ellis]], [[William Gropper]], [[Eitaro Ishigaki]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/searchimages/images/item_2174.htm Eitaro Ishigaki, from the Federal Art Project, Photographic Division collection - Image Gallery | Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20100929091725/http://www.comradesinart.net/comrades_flv/Gan_Kolski/index.html Gan Kolski], [[Louis Lozowick]], [[Jan Matulka]], Morris Pass, [[Anton Refregier]], [[Louis Leon Ribak]], [[Esther Shemitz]], Otto Soglow, and [[Art Young]].&lt;ref name=NM-1930-01/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hemingway"&gt;

* '''1930:''' The second exhibition occurred in January 1930:  42 drawings, paintings, and lithographs that traveled from the Borough Park Workers' Club (43rd Street, Brooklyn) to other clubs in [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]], [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], the [[Bronx]], and [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;
* '''1931:''' The third exhibition occurred in April 1931 with the "[[Proletpen]]," a [[Yiddish]] cultural group of the [[Communist Party]]:  it comprised some 100 paintings, drawings, and cartoons by some 30 artists.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;
* '''1932:''' "Twenty John Reed Club Artists on Proletarian and Revolutionary Themes" occurred at the [[American Contemporary Art]] (ACA) Gallery in November 1932:  36 paintings, drawings, and lithographs by 21 artists – [[Albert Abramowitz]], Bard, [[Mark Baum (artist)|Mark Baum]], [[Joseph Biel]], [[Jacob Burck]], Dehn, [[Hugo Gellert]], [[William Gropper]], [William Hernandez], [[Eitaro Ishigaki]], Limbach, [[Louis Lozowick]], [[Moses Oley]], Quirt, [[Anton Refregier]], [[Philip Resman]], [[Louis Leon Ribak]], [[William Segal|William Siegel]], Soglow, [[Raphael Soyer]], and [[Max Spivach]].  Four known works comprised Gellert's "Karl Max' Capital in Lithographs" (from a set of 60 lithographs).&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;
* '''1935:''' Another exhibition occurred again at the ACA Gallery&lt;ref&gt;

The last known exhibition occurred at the ACA Gallery: its theme was "The Capitalist Crisis" and gained little notice outside of Communist press organs.

The site of the John Reed Club in New York held exhibitions of member work from the summer of 1930; it established a gallery there in 1932.  Records are scarce for 1932-1935.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;

The [[illuminated manuscript]] '''''Khamsa of Nizami'' [[British Library]], Or. 12208''' is a lavishly illustrated manuscript of the ''Khamsa'' or "five poems" of [[Nizami Ganjavi]], a 12th-century Persian poet, which was created for the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] in the early 1590s by a number of artists and a single scribe working at the Mughal court, very probably in Akbar's new capital of [[Lahore]] in  North [[India]], now in [[Pakistan]].  Apart from the fine [[calligraphy]] of the [[Farsi language|Persian text]], the manuscript is celebrated for over forty [[Mughal miniature]]s of the highest quality throughout the text; five of these are detached from the main manuscript and are in the [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]] as '''Walters Art Museum MS W.613'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedigitalwalters.org/Data/WaltersManuscripts/html/W613/description.html Walters database entry]&lt;/ref&gt;  The manuscript has been described as "one of the finest examples of the Indo-Muslim arts of the book",&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel &amp; Waghmar, 264&lt;/ref&gt; and "one of the most perfect of the ''de luxe'' type of manuscripts made for Akbar".&lt;ref name="Losty &amp; Roy, 49"&gt;Losty &amp; Roy, 49&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Text==
[[File:'Abd al-Rahim 'Ambarin Qalam - Farhad Before Khusraw - Walters W6135A - Full Page.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Khosrow and Shirin|Farhad]] Before [[Khosrau II|Khusraw]]'', one of the Walters' pages]]
The [[Nizami Ganjavi#Quinary .28.22Panj Ganj.22 or .22Khamsa.22.29|collection of five works]] by Nizami or Nizami is a classic of [[Persian poetry]] of which many luxury illuminated manuscript versions have been made; in particular this manuscript should not be confused with British Library, Or. 2265, a Persian manuscript of 1539-43 which is even better known.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 22, 30, 70-97&lt;/ref&gt; The poems are in ''[[masnavi]]'' rhyming couplets.  The first poem is a collection of moral discourses illustrated by stories or [[parable]]s drawn mostly from the lives of historical figures, while the remaining four poems are romances, including many stories found in Persian tradition and earlier works such as the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' of [[Ferdowsi]].&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 7-8, with a fuller account as the miniatures are worked through&lt;/ref&gt;  Akbar had already commissioned a smaller manuscript of the ''Khamsa'', which was made in 1585-90.&lt;ref&gt;Losty &amp; Roy, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miniatures==
The miniatures are attributed by inscriptions to at least twenty artists, most of them apparently [[Hindu]]s, though the main artist, Khvaja Abd-al Samad, is Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 66&lt;/ref&gt; One miniature, of Khusraw hunting, is the latest known work of [[Abd al-Samad]], former head of the imperial workshop and one of the artists [[Humayun]] had brought from Persia some forty-five years earlier, at the start of the Mughal tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 193&lt;/ref&gt;  The single scribe was Abd al-Rahim ('Abd al-Rahim 'Ambarin Qalam), a leading calligrapher of the day. Unusually, when the manuscript was inherited by Akbar's son [[Jahangir]], an extra miniature was added by order of the new emperor with a double portrait showing the scribe at work facing Dawlat, the artist of the new miniature, making a drawing of him.  This is dated, with an illegible last digit, between 1611 and 1620.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;  Some miniatures are the work of more than one artist, typically dividing the work between drawing the overall composition, colouring  and faces. This had been a common method in the imperial workshop, but was giving way to having miniatures all painted by a single artist, as the Mughal style became increasingly concerned with fine detail and realistic depiction.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 17-20; [http://www.imagesonline.bl.uk/results.asp?image=006865 Full page image online, from the British Library]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from their main origin in the tradition of [[Persian miniature painting]], the style of the miniatures reflects Indian art and the Western art that was known in Akbar's court from contacts which included material brought by [[Jesuit]] missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 9, 10, 12, 70&lt;/ref&gt; While the landscapes often show European influence, and indeed north European characteristics, the many animals depicted mostly ignore the mythical beasts often seen in Persian painting, and emphasize species native to India, depicted with considerable naturalism.&lt;ref name="Losty &amp; Roy, 49"/&gt;

The choice and emphasis of the miniatures has certain distinctive features; the selection of subjects was probably made by the royal librarian and approved by the emperor, or possibly the emperor himself, possibly also in consultation with some of the artists. One of the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]]s, unusually, mentions that the book was "commissioned for the treasury of books and august library, servants of his majesty...".&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis on the duties, difficulties and splendour of kingship is to be expected in a royal commission, but another recurring theme, of the difficulties of relationships between fathers and sons, is much more individual to this book (miniatures 5, 14, 16, 18, 20).  There is a particular interest in visual art; apart from the unusual added portrait of the scribe and a painter, both Western-style art works and Hindu sculptures are depicted (miniatures, 25, 36, 44).  Events in the stories are probably also intended to refer to victories of Akbar, and his generosity to the conquered.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Dharm Das - The Death of Darius - Walters W61326B - Full Page.jpg|thumb|''The Death of [[Darius III|Darius]]'', by Dharm Das, another Walters page]]
The manuscript in London has 325 folios of "light-brown polished paper" with a page size of 302 x 198&amp;nbsp;mm.  On text pages the ''[[nastaliq]]'' script is in four columns of 21 lines.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 71&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some text on most of the miniature pages, inside the rectangular frame in compartments of varying size, shape and placing.  The miniatures have somewhat variable rectangular frames of plain lines and bands of colour, outside which there are generous borders filled with very high quality gold ''[[grisaille]]'' decoration of plants, birds and animals, with some rocks and other landscape elements. Outside this are further plain frames, with a final zone of simple pen decoration which is probably recent as the form is different between the pages in London and those in Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 8, 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The main London portion of the manuscript has 36 full-page figurative miniatures, one a double page spread.  Baltimore has four miniatures, also including one double page subject (so five pages). Two further miniatures (or one double one) are missing, as shown by a small and apparently early system of numbering the miniatures.  The manuscript therefore originally had 42 pages of miniatures, counting double pages as two.&lt;ref name="bb8"&gt;Brend, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Some miniatures are out of their natural sequence, but the numbering suggests the manuscript was made in this way.&lt;ref name="bb8" /&gt; Apart from the figurative miniatures, there are a number of pages with decorative panels of abstract motifs, plants and animals, especially at the beginning and end of sections of the work. The original painted and [[lacquer]]ed book covers each (front and back) have one side with a gold and brown scene of animals attacking other animals in a landscape and on the other side a scene with muted colour, one of a hunt and the other of an enthroned ruler, no doubt Akbar, being presented with the catch of game.  All four scenes are enclosed in a frame with two borders of elaborate decoration, which like much of the abstract decorative work is similar in style to Persian, or Mughal, carpet decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 66-69; Losty and Roy, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of the manuscript is unknown after its ownership by Jahangir; the Mughal library amounted to some 24,000 manuscripts at its height, though many were taken by the Iranian [[Nadir Shah]] when he overran much of the Mughal empire in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel &amp; Waghmar, 266&lt;/ref&gt; The known history resumes in 1909, when the London portion was bought by the collector [[Charles William Dyson Perrins|C. W. Dyson Perrins]] (of the [[Worcestershire sauce]] family), who bequeathed it to the [[British Museum]] at his death in 1958.  It came to the British Library when it inherited the British Museum libraries on its foundation in 1973.  The Baltimore leaves had already been separated before 1909.&lt;ref name="bb8"/&gt; In 2013 pages from the manuscript were exhibited in the British Library's exhibition ''Mughal India: Art, Culture and Empire''.&lt;ref&gt;Losty &amp; Roy, 48-55&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[oil painting]] depicts Picasso's mistress and muse, [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]], asleep with a book upon her lap. The painting led to the breakup of Picasso's marriage to [[Olga Khokhlova]] after she saw it at a retrospective exhibition and realised that the facial features were not her own. The painting went to auction in 1989 and in 1996, where it failed to sell. In January 2011, it was announced that ''La Lecture'' would be going to auction on 8 February. The painting, which had not been seen in Europe since the exhibition, was then displayed at [[Sotheby's]] in Paris.

==Background==
Picasso met [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]] in 1927 as she exited the Paris Metro and they later began a relationship, which they kept secret because she was only seventeen and Picasso was married to [[Olga Khokhlova]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12333330|title=Picasso painting La Lecture up for auction|date=1 February 2011|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=1 February 2011 &lt;!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wAuRXEGg|archivedate=1 February 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until he painted ''La Lecture'', Picasso often embedded some of Walter's features in the backgrounds of his other works.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; When ''La Lecture'' was exhibited at a Picasso retrospective, Khokhlova realised that her husband was in a relationship with another woman after noticing that the facial features in the painting were not hers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/art-culture/Picassos-portrait-of-his-mistress-to-fetch-millions/articleshow/7403518.cms|title=Picasso's portrait of his mistress to fetch millions|date=1 February 2011|work=[[The Times of India]]|publisher=[[The Times Group]]|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She ended her marriage to Picasso shortly afterward.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Walter later inspired other Picasso works including ''[[Le Rêve (Picasso)|Le Rêve]]'', which Picasso painted in the same month as ''La Lecture'', and ''[[Nude, Green Leaves and Bust]]''.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; On Walter's influence on Picasso and his work, ''The Art Wolf'' said "Marie-Thérès's potent mix of physical attractiveness and sexual naivety had an intoxicating effect on Picasso, and his rapturous desire for her brought about a number of images that are among the most sought after of his long career."&lt;ref name="ArtWolf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartwolf.com/news/picasso-lecture-en.htm|title='La Lecture', a Picasso portrait of his muse Marie-Thérèse, to be auctioned in London|date=18 January 2011|publisher=The Art Wolf|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period is just about the most desirable of all Picasso's (periods), certainly in market terms."&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; As Picasso painted ''La Lecture'' just days apart from ''La Rêve'', the two paintings are very similar in composition.&lt;ref name="ArtWolf"/&gt;

A '''lead sheet''' is a form of [[musical notation]] that specifies the essential elements of a [[song|popular song]]: the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[harmony]]. The melody is written in [[music notation#Modern notation|modern Western music notation]], the lyric is written as text below the [[musical staff|staff]] and the harmony is specified with [[chord notation|chord symbols]] above the staff.

The lead sheet does not describe the chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]], [[voice leading]], [[bass line]] or other aspects of the [[accompaniment]]. These are specified later by an [[arrangement|arranger]] or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] by the performers&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.76. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, and are considered aspects of the arrangement or performance of a song, rather than a part of the song itself. 

A lead sheet may also specify an instrumental part or theme, if this is considered essential to the song's identity. For example, the opening [[guitar riff]] from [[Deep Purple]]'s "[[Smoke on the Water]]" is a part of the song; any performance of the song should include the guitar riff, and any imitation of that guitar riff is an imitation of the song. Thus the riff belongs on the lead sheet.

== Performance with lead sheets ==
A lead sheet is often the only form of written music used by a small [[jazz]] ensemble. One or more musicians will play the melody while the rest of the group improvises an appropriate accompaniment based on the [[chord progression]] given in the [[chord symbol]]s, followed by an improvised solo also based on the [[chord progression]]. Similarly, a sufficiently skilled [[jazz]] [[pianist]] should be able to accompany a singer and perform a song by her or himself using only a lead sheet.

Lead sheets are also called '''fake sheets''' and collections of lead sheets are called "[[fake book|fakebooks]]".

== Lead sheet as legal definition of a song ==
The melody, lyrics, and harmony define what a song is. In the [[music industry]] and [[entertainment law]], a lead sheet is the document used to describe a song for legal purposes. For example, a lead sheet is the form of a song to which [[copyright]] is applied—if a [[songwriter]] sues someone for copyright violation, the court will compare lead sheets to determine how much of the song has been copied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Krasilovsky et al. 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or if a song is considered for an [[Academy Award]] or a [[Grammy]], the song is submitted for consideration in the form of a lead sheet.

The '''National Gallery of Ireland''' ({{lang-ga|Gailearaí Náisiúnta na hÉireann}}) houses the national collection of Irish and European art. It is located in the centre of [[Dublin]] with one entrance on [[Merrion Square]], beside [[Leinster House]], and another on Clare Street. It was founded in 1854 and opened its doors ten years later.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgallery.ie/history|title=History|website=National Gallery of Ireland|language=en|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallery has an extensive, representative collection of Irish paintings and is also notable for its [[Baroque painting#Italian|Italian Baroque]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch masters]] painting. The current director is Sean Rainbird.

== History ==
In 1853 an [[Exhibition game|exhibition]], the [[Great Industrial Exhibition (1853)|Great Industrial Exhibition]], was held on the lawns of [[Leinster House]] in Dublin. Among the most popular exhibits was a substantial display of works of art organised and underwritten by the railway magnate [[William Dargan]]. The enthusiasm of the visiting crowds demonstrated a public for art, and it was decided to establish a permanent public art collection as a lasting monument of gratitude to Dargan. The moving spirit behind the proposal was the [[barrister]] [[John Edward Pigot]] (1822-1871), son of [[David Richard Pigot]], [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]], and he became one of the first Governors of the Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Ireland Act 1854 section 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The façade of the National Gallery copies the Natural History building of the [[National Museum of Ireland]] which was already planned for the facing flank of Leinster House. The building itself was designed by [[Francis Fowke]], based on early plans by [[Charles Lanyon]], and was completed and opened in 1864.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57429422|title=1854-2004 : the story of the National Gallery Of Ireland|last=Peter.|first=Somerville-Large,|date=2004|publisher=National Gallery Of Ireland|isbn=1904288081|location=[Dublin]|oclc=57429422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Gallery was not to founded around an existing collection, and when the Gallery opened it had just 112 paintings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1866 an annual purchase grant was established and by 1891 space was already limited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1897, the Dowager Countess of Milltown indicated her intention of donating the contents of [[Russborough House]] to the Gallery. This gift included about 223 paintings, 48 pieces of sculpture, 33 engravings, much silver, furniture and a library, and prompted construction from 1899 to 1903 of what is now called the Milltown Wing, designed by [[Thomas Newenham Deane]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/reading-the-pictures-1.126214|title=Reading the pictures|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At around this time [[Henry Vaughan (art collector)|Henry Vaughan]] left 31 watercolours by [[J.M.W. Turner]] with the requirement that they could only be exhibited in January, this to protect them from the ill-effects of sunlight. Though modern lighting technology has made this stipulation unnecessary, the Gallery continues to restrict viewing of the Vaughan bequest to January and the exhibition is treated as something of an occasion.

Another substantial bequest came with the untimely death in the sinking of the {{RMS|Lusitania||2}} of [[Hugh Lane]] (1875–1915), since 1914 director of the Gallery; not only did he leave a large collection of pictures, he also left part of his residual estate and the Lane Fund has continued to contribute to the purchase of art works to this day. In addition to his involvement in the Gallery, Hugh Lane has also hoped to found a gallery of modern art, something only realised after his death in [[Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane]]. [[George Bernard Shaw]] also made a substantial bequest, leaving the Gallery a third of royalties of his estate in gratitude for the time he spent there as a youth.

The Gallery was again extended in 1962 with a new wing designed by Frank DuBerry of the [[Office of Public Works]]. This opened in 1968 and is now named the Beit Wing. In 1978 the Gallery received from the government the paintings given to the nation by [[Chester Beatty Library|Chester Beatty]] and in 1987 the Sweeney bequest brought fourteen works of art including paintings by [[Picasso]] and [[Jack B. Yeats]]. The same year the Gallery was once again given some of the contents of [[Russborough House]] when [[Alfred Lane Beit|Alfred Beit]] donated 17 masterpieces, including paintings by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]], [[Jan Steen|Steen]], [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] and [[Henry Raeburn|Raeburn]].

In the 1990s a lost [[Caravaggio]], ''[[The Taking of Christ]]'', known through replicas, was discovered hanging in a Jesuit house of studies in Leeson Street in Dublin by [[Sergio Benedetti]], senior conservator of the gallery.  The Jesuits have generously allowed this painting to be exhibited in the Gallery and the discovery was the cause of national excitement. The painting was on loan to an Italian gallery from February until July 2010 as part of Caravaggio's 400th anniversary. In 1997 [[Anne Yeats]] donated sketchbooks by her uncle [[Jack Yeats]] and the Gallery now includes a Yeats Museum. Denis Mahon, a well known art critic, promised the Gallery part of his rich collection and eight painting from his promised bequest are on permanent display, including ''Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph'' by [[Guercino]].

== Millennium Wing ==
A new wing, called the Millennium Wing, was opened in 2002. Unlike the previous two extensions, this new wing has street frontage and the English architects Benson &amp; Forsyth gave it an imposing Bowers Whitbed, Portland Stone façade and grand atrium. The design originally involved demolishing an adjoining Georgian terrace house and its ballroom mews; however, the Irish planning appeals authority, An Bord Pleanála, required that they be retained. The Millennium Wing is not without its critics: it is unforgiving of poor maintenance and the compromise in the design as required by An Bord Pleanala resulted in a final design diluted from the original competition winning building concept. The circulation space also lacks clarity, but it is generally considered that these flaws are trivial details set against the drama of the building. In line with its Brutalist style, the interior concrete walls are still unsealed.

== Master Development Plan ==
[[File:20130810 dublin025.JPG|thumb|220px|View of interior, c.2013]]
In March 2011, the Office of Public Works (OPW), in association with the Gallery, commenced work on the historic complex at Merrion Square to address a critical need for the repair and renovation of the fabric Of the Dargan(1864) and Milltown(1903) wings, together with the provision of much needed additional accommodation. The first phase of the works programme involved the removal and replacement of the Dargan Wing roof. The next two phases of the project involved the replacement of the Milltown Wing roof, followed by an extensive upgrade of the fabric and services of the two buildings whilst reclaiming their original period elegance. Refurbishment of the two wings were completed in June 2017.

== Location, access and facilities ==
The National Gallery of Ireland is located in the heart of Georgian Dublin. There are two entrances, one at Merrion Square and the other at Clare Street. Admission to the gallery is free and many talks, tours and events as well as the audioguide are also free of charge. The gallery launched a free smartphone app in 2013.

[[Dublin Bus]] routes 4, 7 and 7a all pass by the gallery. The Pearse Street [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] station is 5 minutes on foot as is the Dawson stop on the green line of the [[LUAS]]. The Abbey Street stop of the red line of the [[LUAS]] is a 20-minute walk away. There are two [[dublinbikes]] stations just outside the gallery, one at Clare Street and the other at Merrion Square West.

All galleries and entrances are wheelchair and buggy accessible and there are disabled parking spaces outside the Merrion Square entrance. Tours for the visually and hearing impaired are regularly organised. Visitors with guide dogs are welcome in the gallery. The lecture theatre, AV room and gallery shop are all fitted with a loop system for the hearing impaired.

== Highlights ==
The collection has about 14,000 artworks, including about 2,500 oil paintings, 5,000 drawings, 5,000 prints, and some sculpture, furniture and other works of art.

== Library &amp; Archive Collections ==
The [https://www.nationalgallery.ie/what-we-do/library-and-archives library and archive collections] at the National Gallery of Ireland encompass unique and historically significant collections for the study of art history.  The origins of the collections can be traced back to the foundation of the institution over one hundred and sixty years ago. Covering the visual arts from the classical to the contemporary these collections continue to be a vital research element of the National Collection.  The development of the library and archive has been supported principally through public funding and the private donations of generous benefactors.

Open to the public, it has particularly rich holdings relating to the history of western European art from the middle ages on, and the collections relating to Irish and Italian art are extensive. The collection amounts to over 100,000 published volumes, in addition to significant archival holdings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4227">'''Postmodern Communication''' is used to describe the communication and messaging format, styles, guides, technologies and media used in a postmodernist world. Due to its non-traditional means; postmodern communication is also referred to as the information society.&lt;ref name="sbramab-pg110"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From the Modern to the Postmodern:  The future of global communications theory and research in a pandemonic age|last=Braman |first=Sandra |year=2003 |publisher=Sage Publications, Thousand Hills, CA, |pages=109–123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Driven by the need to reach influential audiences and to cut through a cluttered promotional marketplace, brands are reaching out to new communication methods to deliver their advertising message. Furthermore, many marketing practitioners are cited as saying that in order to create successful marketing strategies in the twenty-first century, "more creative thinking allied to an integrated approach to all communication activities are needed".&lt;ref name="tproctor-pg144"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Communication in postmodern integrated marketing",|last= Proctor |first= Tony |year=2002 |publisher=Corporate Communications: An International Journal, Vol. 7 Iss: 3|pages=144–154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The origin of postmodern communication is linked to the development of communication theory.  As communication theory studies the technical process of information and the process of human communication,  postmodern communications are the newly created tools and marketplaces that allow these communications to happen.&lt;ref  name="mdainton-pg247"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Communication In Postmodern Integrated Marketing",|last1= Dainton |first1= Marianne |last2= Zellei |first2= Elain | year=2011 |publisher=Sage Publications.|page= 247 |isbn= 1-4129-7691-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most thinking around the postmodern communication and marketing model is driven from an early 90's scholastic journal article created by Stephen Brown and posted to the England Journal of Marketing.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg31"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postmodern Marketing?|last=Brown |first=Steven |year=1993 |publisher=European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 27 Iss: 4|pages=19–34 |issn=0309-0566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it Brown writes, one who approaches marketing from postmodern style should in many ways reject attempts to impost order and working in silos.  Instead markers should work collectively from with artistic attributes of intuition, creativity, spontaneity, speculation, emotion and involvement.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg31"/&gt;

== Postmodern Communication Models ==
With the raise of the internet in the early 1960s and the explosive growth of social networking and mobile phones in the 1980 era, many more tactical postmodern communication models have from.  Below is a short list on these new emerging messaging/communication models.

&lt;br&gt;
In adherence with postmodern communications one can assume that the current trend around marketing communication is within the real time model.  Although this may be the case it is important to realize that these communication models do not accurately depict how brands and advertisers are spending in the space. According to leading advertising spending and research provider, spending around new aged "response" media is set at around 20% of total media spend, while unidirectional models make up roughly 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emarketer.com/PressRelease.aspx?R=1008432 |title= Online Advertising Market Poised to Grow 20% in 2011 |publisher=emarketer.com |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Prosperous Suzhou''''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|姑蘇|繁華|圖}}|s={{linktext|姑苏|繁华|图}}|p=Gūsū Fánhuá Tú}}), originally entitled '''''Burgeoning Life in a Resplendent Age''''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|盛世|滋生|圖}}|s={{linktext|盛世|滋生|图}}|p=Shèngshì Zīshēng Tú}}), is an 18th-century scroll painting ([[handscroll]]) created in 1759 by the Chinese court painter [[Xu Yang (Qing dynasty)|Xu Yang]].  Depicting the bustling urban life of [[Suzhou]], it combines Western perspective with traditional Chinese style.

== History ==
The [[Qianlong Emperor]] commissioned ''Prosperous Suzhou'' after he returned from an inspection trip to the south in 1751.&lt;ref name="hk"&gt;{{cite web |title=Paintings depict prosperous cities of Ming and Qing dynasties |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200909/24/P200909240131.htm |publisher=info.gov.hk |date=September 24, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took several years for Xu Yang, a native of Suzhou, to complete.&lt;ref name="hk" /&gt; ''Prosperous Suzhou'' was renamed from ''Burgeoning Life in a Resplendent Age'' in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Drawing-Boundaries"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chung |first=Anita |year=2004 |title=Drawing Boundaries: Architectural Images in Qing China |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=9780824826635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

{{Wide image|Prosperous Suzhou.jpg|10000px|''Prosperous Suzhou'' by Xu Yang|dir=rtl}}

''Prosperous Suzhou'' is a [[handscroll]], a long narrow scroll for displaying a series of scenes. It is twelve meters in length.&lt;ref name="hk" /&gt; It is intended to be viewed starting from the right end, by laying it flat on a table and unrolling it. One admires it section for section during the unrolling as if traveling through a landscape, depicting a continuous journey.&lt;ref name="Delbanco"&gt;Delbanco, Dawn (2008). [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/chhs/hd_chhs.htm "Chinese Handscrolls"]. In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved November 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

European art and its techniques like [[linear perspective]] became increasingly influential in China the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="VAM-1600-1900"&gt;{{cite web |title=Masterpieces of Chinese Painting 700 - 1900: Challenging the Past and Looking to the West 1600-1900 |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/album/18977 |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |accessdate=November 13, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113230902/http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/album/18977 |archivedate=November 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skillfully composed, ''Prosperous Suzhou'' combines Western linear perspective with traditional Chinese compositional devices.&lt;ref name="Drawing-Boundaries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VAM-1600-1900" /&gt; The scroll is invaluable from both a historical and an artistic point of view,&lt;ref name="JoA"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hung | first1 = W.

In his inscription at the end of the scroll, Xu Yang wrote that he painted it in order to depict a peaceful and prosperous reign, and to pay homage to the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]].&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;{{cite web |title=Suzhou Scroll |url=http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hsa13/scroll/suzhou_viewer.html |publisher=[[Harvard]] |accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, his inscription describes the scroll as a journey from [[Mount Lingyan]] to the city walls of Suzhou, through the city, and ending at [[Tiger Hill, Suzhou|Tiger Hill]].&lt;ref name="Drawing-Boundaries" /&gt;

The scroll vividly illustrates the visual appearance of the terrain, urban landscapes, and everyday life in an area covering several dozen miles. The middle of the scroll depicts an idealised view of all the activities of the bustling urban center of Suzhou. Viewers can see numerous merchants, traders, barges and passenger boats, as well as dense rows of shops and vendors. More than 4,800 human figures,&lt;ref name="hk" /&gt; 2,000 architectural structures,&lt;ref name="hk" /&gt; and 400 boats&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt; are present.

It is currently chaired by Sir [[Hayden Phillips]], who was appointed on 17 March 2014 for a term of five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/download-file/RCEWA%20members%20May%202017.pdf |title=Membership of the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest |website=Arts Council England |date=May 2017 |accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/download-file/Export%20Objects%20Cultural%20Interest%202015-16.pdf |author=Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest |title=62nd Annual Report (May 2015–April 2016) |publisher=Department for Culture Media &amp; Sport |date=23 February 2017 |isbn=978-1-4741-3874-1 |accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If an artwork is sold to a foreign buyer, it also advises the DCMS on whether to delay the granting of an export licence in order to allow time for a British buyer to raise funds to buy the work instead and keep it in the UK, if the committee decides the work is of high enough quality and has a sufficiently significant British connection - this is known as an export bar.

==Waverley Criteria==
The RCEWA was established in 1952, in accordance with the recommendations of the [[Viscount Waverley|Waverley]] Committee, and assesses the objects before it against the three "Waverley Criteria":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/export-controls/reviewing-committee#section-2 |title=Reviewing Committee: How decisions are made |website=[[Arts Council England]] |accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Is it so closely connected with our history and national life that its departure would be a misfortune?
* Is it of outstanding aesthetic importance?
* Is it of outstanding significance for the study of some particular branch of art, learning or history?

The '''Royal West of England Academy''' ('''RWA''') is Bristol's oldest art gallery, located in [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]], [[Bristol]], near the junction of Queens Road and [[Whiteladies Road]]. Situated in a Grade 2* listed building, it hosts five galleries and an exhibition programme that celebrates the best of historic and contemporary British art.

== History ==

The Royal West of England Academy was the first art gallery to be established in Bristol. Its foundation was financed by a bequest of £2,000 in the  will of [[Ellen Sharples]] in 1849,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal West Of England Academy|url=http://www.saatchigallery.com/museums/museum-profile/Royal+West+Of+England+Academy/378.html|publisher=Saatchi Gallery|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a well-known group of artists in Bristol, known as the Bristol Society of Artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.rwa.org.uk/about/history/|publisher=Royal West of England Academy|accessdate=20 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222121310/http://www.rwa.org.uk/about/history/|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=artbiogs&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal West of England Academy|url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/royal-west-england-academy|publisher=Artist Biographies|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were mostly landscape painters, and many, such as [[William James Müller]], [[Francis Danby]], [[James Baker Pyne]] and [[John Syer]] were well known.&lt;ref name=artbiogs/&gt; In 1844, when the Bristol Academy for the Promotion of Fine Arts was founded, the Bristol Society of Artists was incorporated into it. At this time the president and committee was predominantly its patrons, rather than its artists. In 1913 King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] granted the academy its Royal title,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951|url=http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib1_1218014208|publisher=University of Glasgow|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the reigning monarch as its Patron,&lt;ref name=bridgeman&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal West of England Academy|url=http://www.bridgemanimages.com/en-GB/collections/collection/royal-west-of-england-academy/|publisher=Bridgeman Images|accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1914 a major extension to the front of the building, including the dome and [[Walter Crane]] lunettes, was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lunettes|url=http://www.elizabethholford.co.uk/thelunettes.html|publisher=Elizabeth Holford Associates|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willsdon|first1=Clare A.|title=Mural Painting in Britain 1840-1940: Image and Meaning|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198175155|page=283|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oNJo8VKfBmkC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=Royal+West+of+England+Academy+Walter+Crane+lunettes+1914&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e60D39G8sn&amp;sig=7KcY1eJLHJxYwMNtMD8v_O5Bk5Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjczZHJhevJAhUHuhoKHRqxDi0Q6AEIOzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Royal%20West%20of%20England%20Academy%20Walter%20Crane%20lunettes%201914&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]] the academy building was taken over by various organisations including the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] and the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref name=bridgeman/&gt; Immediately after the war ended the council applied for the release of the galleries but was informed that they would be occupied by the [[Inland Revenue]] until further notice. It was not until 1950 that the building was returned to its original function, after the intervention of the then prime minister, [[Clement Attlee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the RWA |work=Royal West of England Academy |url=http://www.rwa.org.uk/histfrm.htm |accessdate=2006-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716064532/http://www.rwa.org.uk/histfrm.htm |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bridgeman/&gt; During the 1950s the Royal West of England Academy Schools became the West of England College of Art.&lt;ref name=artbiogs/&gt; This moved to the Bower Ashton campus in 1966, where it was then absorbed by the University of the West of England (School of Visual Studies), now the [[Department of Creative Industries, UWE, Bristol]]. The current president is the artist Stewart Geddes PRWA and director is Alison Bevan BEM.

== Collections ==

Among the paintings in the permanent collection are works by artists from the [[Newlyn School|Newlyn]], [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] and [[Bloomsbury]] Schools and paintings by [[Elizabeth Blackadder]], [[Bernard Dunstan]], [[Mary Fedden]], [[Matthew Hale (artist)|Matthew Hale]], [[David Inshaw]], [[Derek Balmer]], [[Anne Redpath]], [[George Swaish]] and [[Carel Weight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Permanent Collection|url=http://www.rwa.org.uk/rwa-artists/permanent-collection/|publisher=Royal West of England Academy|accessdate=20 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110143924/http://www.rwa.org.uk/rwa-artists/permanent-collection/|archivedate=10 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is a grade II* [[listed building]] constructed in 1857 as the city's first public art gallery, also encompassing an art school. It opened in 1858. The interiors are by [[Charles Underwood]] and facade by [[JR Hirst]], altered in 1912 by [[SS Reay]] and [[H Dare Bryan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal West of England Academy|url=http://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1282156|website=National Heritage List for England|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first floor is in 3 sections, the outer ones articulated by paired Corinthian pilasters flanking large shell head niches with statues of [[John Flaxman|Flaxman]] and [[Joshua Reynolds|Reynolds]]. A large carving of 3 female figures - the three graces - crowns the parapet. The interior includes coloured [[marble]] and a replica of the [[Parthenon Frieze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal West of England Academy |work=Images of England |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380286 |accessdate=2006-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208081907/http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380286 |archivedate= 8 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new '''seal of the [[United States Virgin Islands]]''' features the three-island design of the main islands of [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]], [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]] and [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]], often seen throughout the territory. It reads "Government of the United States Virgin Islands". It replaces{{when|date=October 2013}} an earlier seal similar to the [[flag of the United States Virgin Islands]], which was based on the central design of the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. The seal also contains the [[flag of the United States]] and also the [[flag of Denmark]] to symbolize its former status as a [[Danish West Indies|Danish colony]] before 1917. There's also, centered in the seal, a [[bananaquit]], the island's [[national bird]]

Designed by St. Thomas artist Mitchlyn E. Davis, Sr. {{cn|date=November 2017}}

'''''Sundial, Boy With Spider''''' is an [[outdoor sculpture]] and functional [[sundial]] by American artist [[Willard Dryden Paddock]] (1873–1956). It is located within the [[Oldfields]] estate on the grounds of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (IMA), in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], United States. The [[bronze]] sculpture, cast by the [[Gorham Manufacturing Company]], depicts a boy sitting cross-legged with an open scroll in his lap.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web | author=Save Outdoor Sculpture! | year=1993 | title=Sundial, Boy With Spider | work=SIRIS | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!26004~!0#focus| accessdate= 17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A young boy sits with his ankles crossed and knees spread, holding a sundial in the form of a scroll in his lap; this scroll is marked in a grid of lines with month names and geographic coordinates.  In his lap beneath the scroll sits a bundle of flowers. The boy’s proper left hand rests on his left knee. His proper right hand, which is in contact with his head, casually holds a twig over the scroll. A wire wrapped around the end of the twig hangs straight down to the base, where it is affixed. A bronze spider is affixed to the wire in the correct place to act as the [[gnomon]] of the sundial. (The wire, twig, and spider are restorations from 2004.)&lt;ref name=Conservation&gt;Indianapolis Museum of Art.

==Condition==
The bronze sculpture is monitored, cleaned, and treated regularly by the IMA art conservation staff.  The surface of the bronze is protected from deterioration and corrosion by the yearly application of a fresh coat of hard wax.  This sculpture was surveyed in July 1993 of as part of the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture database, and it was considered to be well maintained.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt; In 2004 the IMA conservation staff undertook a major treatment of the sculpture in which the surface was repatinated to unify the color and improve its readability, and the newly fabricated wire and spider gnomon were added to restore the functionality of the sundial.&lt;ref name=Conservation&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2011, the wire and spider are currently missing from the sundial.

[[File:Homage rock 1885.jpeg|thumb|right|Korean artwork shows scholar paying homage to a special stone -- painting with calligraphy by Hô Ryôn, 1885]]

'''''Suseok''''' (수석), also called '''viewing stones''', is the [[Korea]]n term for small naturally occurring or shaped [[rock (geology)|rocks]] which are traditionally valued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreanviewingstones.com/  Suseok at KoreanViewingStones.com]; retrieved 2013-2-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such stones are similar to [[Chinese scholar's rocks]] and Japanese [[suiseki]].&lt;ref name="brokaw73"&gt;Brokaw, Charles. (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=T51TNiU9460C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=  ''The Temple Mount Code,'' p. 73].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Suseok'' can be any color. There are a wide variety of sizes. ''Suseok'' can weigh hundreds of pounds or less than one pound. The term also means stones which are placed in traditional Korean gardens.

==History==
''Suseok'' began as [[votive art]] over 3000 years ago, and began to be seen as worthy of scholars a thousand years ago. The art usually works on three scales: large installations of monumental shaped stones as ornamental gates; medium-sized shaped stones for landscape decoration within [[Korean gardens]]; and the smaller shaped stones for scholar's tables which is the most important.

Chinese scholar's rocks influenced the development of ''suseok'' in Korea.&lt;ref name="brokaw73"/&gt;

==Evaluation==
Early on important sites within landscape were marked with shaped stones, much as those distance markers on post roads. Burial sites were as well given permanent marking by large scale tumulus or mounds, often surrounded by anthropomorphic shaped stones much akin to that of [[Inuit]] or [[First Nations]]' memory markers. The shamanistic belief of nature being alive, and large scaled elements of nature having souls, has led to the continued use of massive sculpted stone in natural forms throughout Korean traditional entranceways as the firstgrowth cedarwood for gates is now rare.

As Confucian scholarship ascended into the golden age of the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty, scholar rocks became an essential fixture of the writing tables of the [[yangban]] class of scholars, and a brilliant example of [[Confucian art]]. The repeated Japanese invasions of Korea, culminating with the 50 year occupation period from 1895 to 1945, saw great theft of Korean scholar stones as well as theft of larger pieces taken to Japan from [[Korean gardens]] or [[Seon garden]] and put into the [[Zen garden]] without reference to origins. Recreating a historical approach to Korean scholar stones is difficult, but it is being done.

Smaller ceramic versions of scholar's rocks have been seen cast in celadon, and used as brush-holders, and as well as water droppers for scholar's [[calligraphy]] - particularly in the shape of small mountains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1531">The '''Symphony No. 2''' of [[Douglas Lilburn]] was completed in 1951, and received its premiere in 1959. It appears to have been revised in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;See: {{OCLC|154285031}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is divided into four movements:
*''Prelude: [[Tempo|Moderato]]'' ([[half note]]=betw. 52-56 ([[tempo|tempo in beats per minute]]))
*''[[Scherzo]]: [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|vivace]]'' ([[quarter note]]=approx. 152)
*''Introduction: Poco lento'' (quarter note=approx. 69) - without pause -
*''Finale: Allegro'' ([[half note]]=betw. 116-120)&lt;ref&gt;metronome markings are from the 1979 score.&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical performance of the piece lasts around 30 minutes, and several recordings exist. The work was published in 1979 by Price Milburn of [[Wellington]]&lt;ref&gt;See: {{OCLC|8319388}} (e.g. University of Missouri Kansas City, other locations. Typeset miniature score, 116 pages.)&lt;/ref&gt; though it seems to have circulated in manuscript copies earlier.&lt;ref&gt;This makes sense as there were several earlier recordings. A holograph of the 1974 revision is at Victoria University of Wellington (see OCLC link), for instance. (According to library and Worldcat, [[holograph]] score- 136 pages.)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7090">'''Symphony No. 3''' by [[Michael Tippett]] is a work for soprano and orchestra with text written by the composer. 

It was composed between 1970 and 1972 and received its premiere on 22 June 1972 at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], London, performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] with the soprano [[Heather Harper]] conducted by [[Colin Davis]]. 

The symphony is notable for its use of [[blues]] and its direct quotation of the opening of the finale of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]]. The work criticises the ecstatic and utopian understanding of the brotherhood of man as expressed in the ''[[Ode to Joy]]'' and instead stresses man's capacity for both good and evil.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, p.93&lt;/ref&gt; The work is consequently characterised by contrasting and conflicting parts, its overall design being "one massive antithesis".&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, p.438&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movements==

The work consists of two parts:
# Allegro non troppo e pesante (Arrest) - Allegro molto e con grande energia (Movement)
# Allegro molto - Slow Blues (Andante) - Fast blues (Allegro)

==Background==

Tippett's conception of the Third Symphony occurred during a concert in [[Edinburgh]] in 1965 during a performance of either [[Pierre Boulez]]'s [[Piano sonatas (Boulez)|Piano Sonata No. 2]]&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, p.439&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Pli selon pli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Tippett detected an absence of harmonic, rhythmic and melodic motion in the work. Such an approach to composition could only be utilised by Tippett if it was presented within the context of a dialectic with its opposite, hence the Third Symphony was constructed on the concepts of "arrest" and "movement" which Tippett likened to the pull and thrust of a jet engine.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, p.92&lt;/ref&gt; Parts 1 and 2 of the work, and their component sections, follow this cycle of "arrest" and "movement".

Describing its creative cycle, Tippett remarked: "The work took seven years of intermittent consideration and eventual creation. From such tiny noting of a future possibility I had to put down a kind of mnemonic shorthand, so that I could remember what I thought the structure of the whole work might be when I’d only experienced the initial moment of conception. ...a great many disjointed, unstructured notions have been noted in my own kind of verbal shorthand. ...the original spontaneous conception of “immobile” polarized against “speedy” (so ridiculously simple, but clearly having the power to initiate the creative process now apparently ready to being) was always the structuring factor. While holding these ideas in my mind over a period of years, allowing them gradually to grow, I come next to a moment when I had nearly everything in my mind except the notes. The symphony so far had a structure and balance; it had ideas about orchestration. Thus I could begin what is usually thought of as the composition. I began at the piano a search for the right sounds. Now I don’t find the precise sounds I want on the piano, but through the piano (this is after all a piece for an orchestra). But I can invent as though the orchestral score were in my head all the time."&lt;ref&gt;Mick Csaky (ed.), ‘Feelings of inner experience’, in How Does it feel? Exploring the world of your senses, (London: Thames and Hudson 1979), 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tippett wanted to avoid the "[[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]] bombast" characteristic of many finales and decided to compose the finale as a set of blues. He possessed a great admiration for [[Bessie Smith]]'s 1925 recording of ''[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St Louis Blues]]'' in particular. Tippett interpreted the repeated bass line of the blues in terms of a [[Henry Purcell|Purcellian]] ground bass, which would make the finale a form of [[passacaglia]]. The most important reason for Tippett's decision to use the blues was its ability to communicate simply and directly.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, p.439&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the time Tippett came to compose the symphony in spring 1970, he had already written the text of the four songs for the finale.&lt;ref&gt;Tippett, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s settings of Chinese poems in ''[[Das Lied von der Erde]]'' served as a precedent for Tippett of a work which articulated song text in the shape of a symphony: "I began thus to plan and organize lyrics that would have a shape - of a human being moving from innocence to experience".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony's text was formulated as a critical response to the sentiment embodied in [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s ''[[Ode to Joy]]'': Schiller's ecstatic celebration of the brotherhood of man was untenable in a century that had witnessed the [[Holocaust]], [[gulag]]s and the dropping of the atomic bomb on [[Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; In the dramatic fourth song, therefore, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is quoted three times at climactic points and its message is challenged in the text and music of the work. Tippett's confrontation with Beethoven is suggested from the outset of the piece, the abrupt chords in the first bar being reminiscent of the opening of Beethoven's own [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 3]].&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, p.441&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscript==
The Third Symphony is certainly one Tippett’s most peculiar looking manuscripts, and his notational practices deserve closer inspection as they reveal how his conceptual design and the compositional strategies he required to deliver it demanded he entirely re-conceive the orchestra, even his own re-conceptualized post-Priam orchestra found in his Concerto for Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Schuttenhelm, ''The Orchestral Music of Michael Tippett: Creative Development and the Compositional Process'' (London: Cambridge University Press, 2013) 239.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The manuscript of the work is in the Tippett Collection (Add MS 61796-61798) of the [[British Library]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5600">The '''Symphony for Solo Piano''' is a large-scale romantic work for piano composed by [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]] and published in 1857.

Although it is generally performed as a self-contained work, it comprises studies Nos. 4-7 from the ''Douze [[étude]]s dans tous les tons mineurs (Twelve Studies in all the minor keys)'', Op. 39, each title being prefaced by the word ''Symphonie'' ([[French language|French]]: ''Symphony''). The four movements are titled ''Allegro'', ''[[Funeral march|Marche Funèbre]]'', ''[[Minuet|Menuet]]'', and ''Finale''. Much like the [[Concerto for Solo Piano (Alkan)|Concerto for Solo Piano]], the Symphony is written so as to evoke the broad palette of timbres and harmonic textures available to an orchestra. It is an early example of a [[Piano symphony]]. In the opinion of François Luguenot, it "does not contain the excesses of [Alkan's] Concerto or the Grande Sonate (Op. 33). But, rather like [Alkan's] Sonatine Op. 61, it proves that Alkan was also capable of writing perfectly balanced and almost ‘Classical’ works."&lt;ref name="hyperion_Hamelin"&gt;Luguenot (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a standard [[classical music|classical]] symphony, each movement is in a different key, rising in [[progressive tonality]] by a [[perfect fourth]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2000), v.2 p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
=== Allegro ===
[[File:Alkan Symphony for Solo Piano Allegro first theme.png|thumb|upright=1|Opening theme of the Allegro.]][[File:Alkan symphony 2nd movement theme.png|thumb|upright=1|Opening of the Funeral March.]][[File:Alkan symphony movement 4 theme.png|thumb|upright=1|Opening of the Finale.]]The opening movement in C minor is written in [[sonata form]]. The thematic material of the Allegro is almost entirely derived from the opening theme, which appears in octaves in the left hand.

=== Marche Funèbre ===
The second movement is in [[ternary form]] with a [[legato]] melody over [[staccato]] chords in the first section and a lyrical [[chorale]] in the middle section.

François Luguenot wrote:&lt;ref name="hyperion_Hamelin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The second movement is a [[funeral march]] in F minor, rather [[Gustav Mahler|Mahlerian]] in style. In the original edition the title page read ‘Symphonie: No 2. Marcia funebre sulla morte d’un Uomo da bene ['Funeral march on the death of a good man’], words which have sadly been lost in all subsequent editions. Of course one is reminded of the subtitle of the ‘Marcia funebre’ in Beethoven’s third symphony. But might we not regard this ‘uomo da bene’ as Alkan’s father, Alkan Morhange, who died in 1855, two years before these studies were published?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jack Gibbons]] wrote:&lt;ref name="Gibbons_facebook"&gt;[https://lt-lt.facebook.com/JackGibbonsPiano/posts/10151807117194384 Jack Gibbons Facebook entry, 3 July 2013], accessed 3 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; "The funeral march's sense of restraint is borne out by Alkan's marking over the gentle central section, "with contained sorrow" [...] The distant drum roll that interrupts the march near its close adds an Alkanesque sense of disquiet to this already sombre music."

=== Menuet ===
The Menuet is in ternary form, like the Marche Funèbre. François Luguenot writes that "the Minuet in B{{music|flat}} minor is in fact a [[scherzo]] that anticipates shades of [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]]—full of energy and brightened by a lyrical trio."&lt;ref name="hyperion_Hamelin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Corleonis suggests that "[[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] are in closest proximity in the hectic Minuet, combining the spirit of the Ronde du Sabbat and Marche au Supplice from the former's ''[[Symphonie Fantastique]]'', with a palpable debt to the Minuet from the latter's [[String_Quartets,_Op._76_(Haydn)#Opus_76.2C_No._2_.28.22Fifths.22.29|"Les Quintes" Quartet, Op. 76/2]], which Alkan transcribed."&lt;ref&gt;Corleonis (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finale ===
The final movement is extremely technically demanding. Luguenot comments that "the final Presto in E{{music|flat}} minor, memorably described by [[Raymond Lewenthal]] as a ‘ride in hell’, brings the work to a breathless close."&lt;ref name="hyperion_Hamelin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance history==

In the opinion of [[Jack Gibbons]]: "That music of this quality has remained neglected in the 150 or so years since its creation is a shocking scandal ... Alkan performed extracts of the work himself at his series of 'Petits Concerts' in Paris in the 1870s but the next notable performance wasn't until 1938 when [[Egon Petri]] performed the Symphony for [[BBC]] radio in London. Gramophone recordings of the work didn't appear for another 25 years, and though today the work is performed more often than at any time in the past, its appearance in a concert programme is still unusual."&lt;ref name="Gibbons_facebook"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Syringomas''' are harmless eccrine [[sweat gland|sweat duct]] [[tumors]], typically found clustered on eyelids, although they may also be found in the [[armpit]]s, abdomen, chest, neck, scalp or groin area including genitals in a symmetric pattern.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book |author1=James, William D. |author2=Berger, Timothy G. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|663|date=June 2009}} They are skin-colored or yellowish firm, rounded bumps, 1–3&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, and may be confused with [[xanthoma]], [[Milium (dermatology)|milia]], [[hidrocystoma]], [[trichoepithelioma]], and [[xanthelasma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Skin lesions, tumours and cancers. DermNet NZ|url = http://www.dermnetnz.org/lesions/|website = www.dermnetnz.org|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are more common in women and are most commonly found in middle-aged Asian women. While they can present at any time in life, they typically present during adolescence. They are usually not associated with any other symptoms although can sometimes cause itchiness or irritation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Syringoma. DermNet NZ|url = http://www.dermnetnz.org/lesions/syringoma.html|website = www.dermnetnz.org|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types==
* '''Eruptive''' this form typically presents on the anterior chest, abdomen, neck and arms. It presents in successive crops with periods of relief in between times of active rash.
* '''Milia-like'''  this type of syringoma is typically smaller lesions that have a milky white center that can look like [[Milium (dermatology)|milia]].
* '''Plaque type''' this type is more commonly associated with itchiness and chronic scratching that leads to epidermal thickening similar to [[lichen planus]].
* '''Familial''' some cases of syringoma exhibit a familial pattern in an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Chromosome 16q22 has been shown to be involved in the genetic links of syringoma.

=== Associated syndromes ===

Syringomas can be found in association with other symptoms as part of a syndrome. [[Hailey–Hailey disease|Hailey-Hailey]] disease also known as familial benign chronic pemphigus is a blistering disease that can also include syringomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hailey-Hailey disease (benign familial pemphigus). DermNet NZ|url = http://www.dermnetnz.org/systemic/familial-pemphigus.html|website = www.dermnetnz.org|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several systemic syndromes have also been associated with syringoma including [[diabetes mellitus]], [[down syndrome]], Brooke-Spiegler, and Nicolau-Balus. Specifically, diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with clear cell syringoma consisting of nests of clear cells containing glycogen. It is thought that phosphorylase deficiency, resulting from elevated glucose levels seen in diabetes leads to an accumulation of glycogen in the skin and within the clear cells. The incidence of syringomas  has been reported in up to 40 percent of people with Down syndrome and can be associated with a condition [[calcinosis cutis]] which requires prompt medical attention. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome with cutaneous manifestations including syringomas and trichoepitheliomas. Nicolau-Balus is a rare autosomal dominant disorder consisting of atrophoderma vermiculata and syringomas.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:SkinTumors-P8080545.JPG|thumb|Syringoma (eccrine)]]
The pathophysiology of syringomas remains largely unknown. Familial patterns presenting in an autosomal dominant pattern suggest a genetic link that can result in varying genetic aberrations in lesions, specifically chromosome 16q22. The most commonly accepted theory is that syringomas are benign growths that arise from the intraepidermal portion of eccrine ducts. Another theory suggests that syringomas are a reactive hyperplasia rather than a true neoplasm resulting after inflammatory processes such as eczema. It has also been suggested that a hamartomatous process could explain eruptive syringomas. A hamartoma of pluripotent stem cells could precede the pathological process. Syringomas may also be under hormonal influence explaining the female predominance.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Diagnosis ==
Syringomas can often be diagnosed clinically based on presentation, distribution patterns over the body, lack of associated symptoms and family history. A definitive diagnosis requires a [[skin biopsy]] to allow the tissue to be examined under a microscope. Histologically, syringomas have a characteristic comma ("tadpole") shaped tail of dilated, cystic eccrine ducts.

== Treatment ==
The goal of treatment is to improve the appearance of lesions since they are otherwise not serious and typically do not cause symptoms. Many treatment methods have been attempted however, complete removal is uncommon. No single treatment method has been shown to consistently work. Both medical and surgical treatments have been studied, each with variable success. Common destructive treatment methods include carbon dioxide lasers, dermabrasion, surgical excision, electrocoagulation and chemical peels. Many of these methods are very time consuming and require multiple treatment sessions.Carbon dioxide lasers are the most commonly practiced method; however, can cause thermal damage leading to scarring in the area. Medical therapies include topical [[atropine]], topical retinoids and oral [[tranilast]].

The most common adverse side effects include redness, skin discoloration and pain. Other side effects include blistering and scarring.

[[File:Edward-Burne-Jones-Wake-Dearest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|''Wake Dearest'', from the printed facsimiles]]
'''''The Flower Book''''' by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] (1833–1898) is a series of 38 round watercolours, each about six inches across, painted from 1882 to 1898. The paintings do not depict flowers; rather, they were inspired by the flowers' names. Burne-Jones called them "a series of illustrations to the Names of Flowers". "Not a single flower itself appears", according to his wife Georgiana.&lt;ref name=leicester/&gt; They were painted for his private pleasure, many while he was resting at his summer home in [[Rottingdean]], and were described by his wife as the "most soothing piece of work that he ever did".&lt;ref name=leicester&gt;[http://www.leicestergalleries.com/19th-20th-century-paintings/d/the-flower-book%3A-iv-travellers-joy/12075 Leicester Galleries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wildman"&gt;Wildman (1998), pp. 285–86&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 Georgiana, by then a widow, published a limited edition of high-quality colour [[facsimiles]].

==Themes and technique==
[[File:Edward Burne-Jones Witches Tree (Flower Book).png|thumb|upright=1.0|''Witches' Tree'', from the printed facsimiles]]
[[File:Love in a Tangle Burne Jones Brit Museum.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|''Love in a Tangle'', from the watercolour in the British Museum]]

Worked in [[watercolor painting|watercolours]], [[gouache|bodycolour (gouache)]], and gold paint, the paintings reflect the landscape around Rottingdean and include favourite themes from Burne-Jones's work: ''Witches' Tree'' (no. xv) revisits the subject of ''[[The Beguiling of Merlin]]'' and ''Meadow Sweet'' (no. xxxv) features the central figures from ''[[The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon]]''.&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;

Burne-Jones collected folknames of flowers from many sources, but the greatest number were provided by Eleanor Leighton, Lady Leighton Warren, who shared her "knowledge of the names and legends belonging to flowers".&lt;ref&gt;Burne-Jones (1906), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to her, he wrote:
{{quotation|Pray send me as many names as ever you can, for alack it is not one in ten that I can use. Of course I could make pictures to all, but I want the name and the picture to be one soul together, and indissoluble, as if they could not exist apart; so many lovely names and nothing to be done with them.&lt;ref&gt;Burne-Jones (1906), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a later letter, he added, "You see how I want to deal with them: it is not enough to illustrate them—that is such poor work: I want to add to them or wring their secret from them".&lt;ref&gt;Burne-Jones (1906), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
On his death, Burne-Jones left the album of flower paintings to his wife [[Georgiana Burne-Jones|Georgiana]], and she published a facsimile edition of 300 copies in 1905 in co-operation with the [[Fine Art Society]] in London. It was printed by Henri Piazza, who hand-stencilled watercolour over [[collotype]]s using the [[Stencil|pochoir]] technique to produce brilliant colours.
These copies of the "Book" were sold in both bound and unbound form, with the unbound copies contained in a clamshell box.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artknowledgenews.com/26_01_2012_03_02_17_the_delaware_art_museum_features_edward_burne_jones_flower_book_illustrations.html Art Knowledge News] The Delaware Art Museum Features Edward Burne-Jones "Flower Book Illustrations"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wildman" /&gt;

[[File:Illustrations to Robert Blair's The Grave , object 16 Death's Door.jpg|thumb|right|''Death's Door'' by William Blake, an illustration for ''The Grave''.  The "resting youth" figure at the top can also be seen (with variations in inking, colouring, and background) in several of Blake's prior works.  It appears on plate 21 of ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', in ''[[America a Prophecy|America]]'', and in plate 4 of ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]''.{{sfn|Makdisi|2003|p=121}}  The figure of the old man at the bottom also occurs elsewhere, as an illustration, also entitled ''Death's Door'' for Blake's own ''For Children: The Gates of Paradise'', as well as in plate 12 of ''America''.  There is a similar figure of an old man, on one crutch and being helped through the streets by a young child, in ''London'' and in ''Jerusalem''.{{sfn|Makdisi|2003|p=121}}  The first time that Blake put both figures together, as here, was in a pencil sketch that dates to the time of ''America''.  They also appear together in a further (undated) pencil sketch, traced over in ink, with a pyramid in the background.{{sfn|Makdisi|2003|p=121}}]]

'''''The Grave''''' is a [[blank verse]] poem by the Scottish poet [[Robert Blair (poet)|Robert Blair]].{{sfn|Davenport|1822|p=199}}  It is the work for which he is primarily renowned.{{sfn|Davenport|1822|p=199}}{{sfn|Johnstone|1827|p=135}}  According to Blair, in a letter he wrote to Dr. Dodderidge, the greater part of the poem was composed before he became a minister,{{sfn|Davenport|1822|p=199}} Edinburgh editor and publisher John Johnstone stating that it was composed whilst he was still a student, although "probably corrected and amplified by his more matured judgement".{{sfn|Johnstone|1827|p=135}}  The poem, 767 lines long, is an exemplar of what became known as the school of [[Graveyard poets|graveyard poetry]].{{sfn|Crawford|2008|p=261}}

Part of the poem's continued prominence in scholarship involves a later printing of poems by [[Robert Hartley Cromek]] which included illustrations completed by the Romantic poet and illustrator [[William Blake]]. He completed forty illustrations for the poem, twenty of which were printed in Cromek's edition.{{sfn|Yoder|2001|p=26}}{{sfn|Review|1864|p=51}}{{sfn|Snart|2006|p=77}} Blake's original watercolours for the prints were believed lost, until they were rediscovered in 2003.{{sfn|Crawford|2008|p=261}}

== First publication and critical reception ==
According to that same letter to Dodderidge, two publishers rejected the poem before it was finally first published in 1743, in London by Mr. Cooper.{{sfn|Davenport|1822|p=199}}  The grounds for rejection, as related by Blair, were that he lived too far away from London to be able to "write so as to be acceptable to the fashionable and polite".{{sfn|Davenport|1822|p=199}}  He sarcastically observed that "to what distance from the metropolis these sapient booksellers conceived poetical inspiration to extend, we are not informed".{{sfn|Davenport|1822|p=199}}

The first edition was not particularly successful, and there was no second edition of the work until 1747, when it was republished in Edinburgh.{{sfn|Davenport|1822|p=199}}  Its popularity grew gradually throughout the 18th century, however, in part because of the praise that it received from [[John Pinkerton]] (in his ''Letters of Literature'' (1786), written under the pseudonym Robert Heron).{{sfn|Davenport|1822|p=200}}{{sfn|Johnstone|1827|p=135}}

Writing in 1822, [[Richard Alfred Davenport]] noted that the editor of ''British Poets'' spoke of the poem with "severity" and a "contemptuous tone".{{sfn|Davenport|1822|p=200}}  Davenport contrasted this with the praise given by [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]] in his biographical sketch of Blair in ''British Poets''.{{sfn|Davenport|1822|p=200}}  Campbell stated that "the eighteenth century has few specimens of blank verse of so powerful and so simple a character as that of ''The Grave''", and he described the poem as popular "not merely because it is religious, but because its language and imagery are free, natural, and [[picturesque]]".{{sfn|Campbell|1819|p=204}}

Davenport himself went on to state that whilst the language "is occasionally familiar", echoing the charge of vulgarity levelled by the ''British Poets'' editor, "many of his similies, epithets, and detached expressions are eminently beautiful".{{sfn|Davenport|1822|p=201}}  He refuted the charge of vulgarity, and opined that perhaps "the general effect would be injured were more elevated expressions substituted".{{sfn|Davenport|1822|p=201}}

Campbell described Blair as having in his poetry "a masculine and pronounced character even in his gloom and homeliness that keeps it most distinctly apart from either dullness or vulgarity".{{sfn|Campbell|1819|p=204}}  Johnstone similarly stated that the poem "everywhere exhibits a manly and vigorous spirit; and if some of the detached sketches want the grace of colouring and the smoothness of beauty, the truth of their anatomy is unimpeachable, and the moral expression dignified and masculine".{{sfn|Johnstone|1827|p=136}}  However, Johnstone was not wholly positive in his criticism, observing that in the close of the poem there is "short-coming, if not absolute failure", and that the final triumph of [[Resurrection]] over the powers of Death and Hell were "felt to be wanting".{{sfn|Johnstone|1827|p=139}}  Rather than "the rapturous exultation of the true poet", the close is "in that tone of sober confidence which might have found place in any eloquent sermon".{{sfn|Johnstone|1827|p=139}}

== Publication by Cromek and Blake's illustrations ==
[[File:Illustrations to Robert Blair's The Grave , object 1 Title-Page Design for The Grave.jpg|thumb|left|Title page of Cromek's 1808 publication of ''The Grave'' with Blake's drawing engraved by Schiavonetti]]

The most famous publication of the poem was by [[Robert Hartley Cromek]], in part because it occasioned an initial friendship between Cromek and [[William Blake]] to turn to acrimony, and in turn because it led to Blake's ''Public Address'', in which he criticized the work of engravers relative to that of illustrators for being as derivative as (amongst others) the translation of the works of [[Homer]] by [[Alexander Pope]] into rhyming couplets.{{sfn|Yoder|2001|p=26}}

Cromek, making his first venture into publication after giving up a career as an engraver, commissioned Blake for a series of illustrations for an edition of ''The Grave'' that he was to publish in 1808.  He commissioned from Blake, in 1805, forty illustrations, a selected twenty of which were to be engraved for the book.  Blake understood that he was also to do those engravings.  However, Cromek gave that work to [[Luigi Schiavonetti]].{{sfn|Yoder|2001|p=26}}{{sfn|Review|1864|p=51}}{{sfn|Snart|2006|p=77}}

Blake was angered by both Cromek and Schiavonetti; Schiavonetti he re-christened "Assassinetti",{{sfn|Eaves|1992|p=262}} and of Cromek he wrote in his notebook: "A petty Sneaking Knave I knew / O Mr Cr &amp;mdash; &amp;mdash;, how do ye do."{{sfn|Snart|2006|p=77}} He was also stung both by the criticism by Robert Hunt, writing in ''The Examiner'' on July 31, 1808, to object to Blake's depiction of the soul as if it were nothing but the mortal body; and by the similar criticism in the November 1808 edition of the ''Anti-Jacobin Review'' which described his illustrations as "the offspring of morbid fancy" and an attempt "to connect the visible with the invisible world" that had "totally failed".{{sfn|Adams|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Yoder|2001|p=26}}  It was this that almost certainly prompted him to ask, in his 1809 advertisement for ''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|A Descriptive Catalogue]]'', his only exhibition of his work in his lifetime, that people "do &amp;#91;him&amp;#93; the justice to examine before they decide".{{sfn|Adams|2010|p=8}}

Blake's biographer [[Alexander Gilchrist]] relates the tale opining that Cromek was right to employ the services of Schiavonetti, and that what Schiavonetti did was "a graceful translation and, as most would think, an improvement". Had Schiavonetti been likewise employed to similarly transcribe Blake's ''Canterbury Pilgrims'' and alter it by "correct smooth touches" then "a different fate would have awaited the composition" from the somewhat lacklustre one that it actually enjoyed.{{sfn|Eaves|1992|p=262}} He describes Blake's illustrations of ''The Grave'' using words such as "extremes", "ravings", and "wild"; a wildness that Schiavonetti tamed.{{sfn|Eaves|1992|p=263}}

However, this account was taken severely to task by the reviewer of Gilchrist's biography in ''The Westminster Review''.  The review questions Gilchrist's assertion that Cromek promised Blake the engraving work, and asks for more evidence of this given that Cromek would have known of the poor reception of Blake's engravings for [[Edward Young|Young]]'s ''[[Night-Thoughts|Night Thoughts]]''.  It questions the existence of Blake's design copyright, and challenges Gilchrist's assertion that Cromek "jockeyed" Blake out of it, especially given that Blake's quarrel with Cromek does not become apparent until longer after the illustrations were in the charge of Schiavonetti.{{sfn|Review|1864|p=51}}  Whilst agreeing that the illustrations were far the better for Schiavonetti's alterations, the reviewer accuses Gilchrist of "uncompromising partisanship" and a wholesale bias against and negative portrayal of Cromek.{{sfn|Review|1864|p=52}}

The most rounded account of the affair, and of Blake's subsequent dealing with Cromek and [[Thomas Stothard]] over the ''Canterbury Pilgrims'', is given by G. E. Bentley Jr{{sfn||Bentley|2013}}), who relates the opinions of all parties and attempts to summarize the evidence, which is both complex and inconclusive.{{sfn|Adams|2010|p=9}}

Blake's original watercolours were believed lost, until they were rediscovered in 2003.{{sfn|Crawford|2008|p=261}}

'''''The Town''''' is a 1903 oil painting by [[August Strindberg]]. It is shown at the [[Nationalmuseum]] in [[Stockholm]].

== Strindberg as a painter ==

August Strindberg had no training in art. He painted only in periods, mainly landscapes and seascapes with dramatic waves and skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063602/SWE_280_010.html
|title=The Town
|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-04-28
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; August Strindberg painted choppy sea in the storm with seething waves, clouds of rebellion and burnings that whips against the rocky shores. His painting method remained personally improvised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.se/sv/Om-samlingarna1/Hojdpunkter-maleri/Staden/|title=Staden - Nationalmuseum|website=www.nationalmuseum.se|access-date=2016-04-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805164907/http://www.nationalmuseum.se/sv/Om-samlingarna1/Hojdpunkter-maleri/Staden/|archivedate=2016-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He painted mostly in periods of crisis, when he had difficulty writing. He did not have a breakthrough as a painter until long after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raa.se/publicerat/rapp2009_2.pdf Vad hade de på paletten?: Bruno Liljefors (1860-1939), Georg von Rosen (1843-1923), prins Eugen (1865-1947) och August Strindberg (1849-1912).]&lt;/ref&gt; He has come to be regarded as a pioneer of expressionism as an art form in Sweden. In the 1870s he spent time with several young artists such as [[Carl Larsson]] and others in [[Grez-sur-Loing]] then himself began attempts in painting. He also worked as an art critic. 

== Painting ==
''The Town'' is an oil painting made with a [[palette knife]], with thick layers of paint laid on the canvas. It is a landscape painting, with a town hinted at in the background, reflected in the water's surface. It is dominated by the dark colors of the high sky and clouds, with a [[color scheme]] in white, black and gray.

The {{Nihongo|'''Tōdōza'''|当道座}} was a [[Japan]]ese guild for blind men, established in the 14th century by the [[biwa hōshi]] {{Nihongo|[[Akashi Kakuichi]]|明石覚一}}.  Members performed a variety of roles, as itinerant musicians, [[massage|masseurs]], and [[acupuncture|acupuncturists]].  It received the patronage of the [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] and [[Edo period|Edo]] shogunates, and remained active until the [[Meiji restoration]], being eventually disbanded in 1871.

The organization was hierarchically structured.  The primary ranks, known as {{Nihongo|''mōkan''|盲官|blind officers}}, were {{Nihongo|Kengyō|検校}} (the highest), then {{Nihongo|Bettō|別当}}, {{Nihongo|Kōtō|勾当}}, and {{Nihongo|Zatō|座頭}}; these were further subdivided into a total of 73 distinct grades.  Total membership was usually around 3,000; it is not known what proportion of the total blind population this represents.

The Tōdōza accepted only male members; a separate organization, the {{Nihongo|''Gozeza''|瞽女座}}, existed for blind women. There was additionally a further guild, the {{Nihongo|''Mōsōza''|盲僧座}}, similar to the Tōdōza but active mostly in the western regions of Japan.

The '''White Ensign''', at one time called the '''St George's Ensign''' due to the simultaneous existence of a cross-less version of the flag, is an [[ensign]] flown on British [[Royal Navy]] [[Royal Navy ships|ships]] and [[shore establishment]]s. It consists of a red [[St George's Cross]] on a white field with the [[Union Flag]] in the upper canton.

The White Ensign is also flown by [[yacht]]s of members of the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] and by ships of [[Trinity House]] escorting [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|the reigning monarch]].

In addition to the United Kingdom, several other nations have variants of the White Ensign with their own national flags in the canton, with the St George's Cross sometimes being replaced by a naval badge omitting the cross altogether. Yachts of the [[Royal Irish Yacht Club]] fly a white ensign with an Irish tricolour in the first quadrant and defaced by the crowned harp from the [[Heraldic Badge of Ireland]]. The [[Flag of the British Antarctic Territory]] and the Commissioners' flag of the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]] place the Union emblem in the first quarter of a white field, omitting the overall red St George's Cross, but are not ensigns for use at sea.

==History==
[[File:Invincible Armada.jpg|thumb|320px|Striped ensigns flying on English and Spanish galleons in 1588: (enlarge image for detailed view)]]
[[File:48 NATO fleet entering Stavanger Norway April 1975.jpg|thumb|250px|The White Ensign flying from a Royal Navy vessel.]]
[[File:Royal Marine, 1914.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Royal Marine]] holding up the White Ensign aboard {{HMS|Pegasus|1897|6}}, during the [[Battle of Zanzibar]] (20 September 1914).]]

English naval ensigns were first used during the 16th century, and were often striped in green and white (the Tudor colours), but other colours were also used to indicate different squadrons, including blue, red and tawny brown. (These striped ensigns can be seen in use on both English and Spanish warships in contemporary paintings of the 1588 [[Spanish Armada]] battles). Later, there was usually a St George's Cross in the upper canton, or sewn across the field as on the modern White Ensign. These striped ensigns continued in use under the Stuart kings: the Naval ensign of 1623 is described as having "15 horizontal stripes alternately blue, white and yellow with a Cross of St George in the canton". This design fell out of use after 1630, with the introduction of the Red, White and Blue ensigns. The use of stripes continued in the red and white of both the [[East India Company|flag of the Honourable East India Company]], adopted in 1600, and of the 1775 [[Grand Union Flag]] that formed the basis for the modern [[flag of the United States of America]], and the red, white and blue striped ensign that serves as the [[flag of Hawaii]].

The first recognisable White Ensign appears to have been in use during the 16th century, consisting of a white field with a broad St George's cross, and a second St. George's cross in the canton. By 1630 the white ensign consisted of simply a white field, with a small St George's cross in the canton, which was consistent with the red and blue ensigns of the time. In 1707, the St. George's cross was reintroduced to the flag as a whole, though not as broad as before, and the [[Union Flag]] was placed in the canton. There was also a version of this flag without the overall St George's cross, which appears to have been for use in home waters only, though this flag appears to have fallen out of use by 1720. In 1801, after the [[Act of Union 1800]], the flag was updated to include the new Union Flag in the canton, and so took on the form as used today. The blue field of the Union Flag was darkened at this time at the request of the [[Admiralty]], in the hope that the new flags would not require replacing as often as the previous design, due to fading of the blue. Throughout this period, the proportions of the flags changed. In 1687, the then [[Secretary of the Admiralty]], [[Samuel Pepys]], instructed that flags be of the ratio 11:18 (18&amp;nbsp;inches long for each breadth, 11&amp;nbsp;inches at the time). In the early 18th century, the breadth of cloth had been reduced to 10&amp;nbsp;inches, so the flags became 5:9. In 1837, the breadth was reduced for the final time to 9&amp;nbsp;inches, giving the current ratio of 1:2.

Throughout this period in the history of the Royal Navy, the White Ensign was one of three ensigns in use, with each one being assigned to one of the three squadrons of the navy, according to its colour (red, white and blue, with red being the most senior and blue the least). Ships flew the colour of ensign corresponding to the squadron to which they were attached, which was in turn determined by the seniority of the admiral under whose command the ship sailed (a rear admiral of the red was senior to a rear admiral of the white).

In 1864 the Admiralty decided to end the ambiguity caused by the Red Ensign being both a [[civil ensign]] and a naval ensign, and the White Ensign was reserved to the [[Royal Navy]]; the relevant [[Order in Council]] retained the option to use Red or Blue Ensigns in HM Ships if desired.

The White Ensign is worn at the mastheads when Royal Navy ships are dressed on special occasions such as the Queen's birthday, and may be similarly be worn by foreign warships when in British waters when dressed in honour of a British holiday or when firing a salute to British authorities.  The White Ensign may also be worn by the boats of commissioned ships. Yachts of the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] and the Trinity House vessels when escorting the [[British Sovereign|British Monarch]] ([[King of the United Kingdom|King]] or [[Queen of the United Kingdom|Queen]] of the [[United Kingdom]]) are also permitted to wear the White Ensign.&lt;ref&gt;

Personnel deployed to non-naval establishments are allocated to the crew of {{HMS|Victory}}.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), including all [[Royal Marines]] establishments. Permission has been granted to some other buildings with naval connections to fly the White Ensign. This includes the [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] Anglican Church in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London, England|London]], which is the [[parish church]] of the [[Admiralty]]. The Ensign is also displayed on the [[Cenotaph]] alongside the [[Union Jack]] flag (for the [[British Army]]) and the [[Royal Air Force Ensign]], in memory of the dead in the World Wars.  Special permission was granted to any individual or body to fly the White Ensign to mark [[Trafalgar Day]] and the victory in the naval [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on its 201st anniversary in 2006.

===Commonwealth of Nations===

The White Ensign was historically used, in its unaltered form, by the naval forces of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, with the [[Blue Ensign]] of each of these [[British Dominions|Dominions]] (as they were then known) as a jack. In 1965, with the adoption of the Maple Leaf [[Canadian flag]], Canada stopped using the White Ensign on its naval vessels in favour of the new flag. Following a reorganisation of the Canadian armed forces in 1968, a new "white ensign" was adopted, incorporating the Canadian flag in the canton and a badge in the fly. This flag, however, was until 2013 not used as the ensign, but as the jack, and also as the basis of the queen's colours of the Royal Canadian Navy. In May 2013 the Canadian "white ensign" became the ensign and the national flag the jack. Many Canadian veterans' organisations still use the original White and Blue Ensigns unofficially as symbols of history and heritage.

During Australia's involvement in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], the RAN modified the White Ensign (1967) to create a uniquely Australian ensign which would avoid any confusion with UK vessels; Britain was not involved in the conflict.  New Zealand followed suit in 1968.  The modified RAN and RNZN White Ensigns incorporate the Union Flag in the first quarter, but with the [[Southern Cross]] designs from each national flag (blue stars for the RAN and red stars for the RNZN) replacing St. George's Cross.

Several other Commonwealth navies also use naval ensigns with a visual connection to the White Ensign. For example, the Indian Navy and the [[South African Navy]] have both retained a cross on a white field, with their own national flag in the canton, in place of the Union Flag. The Royal Indian Marine (Royal Indian Navy from 1934) used the unaltered White Ensign as its ensign from 1928 until 26 January 1950, when India became a republic within the Commonwealth. After that date, the RIN became the Indian Navy and the Union Jack in the canton was replaced with the Indian Tricolour. Apart from a brief period from 2001–2004, the Indian Navy has retained its variant of the White Ensign with one minor modification: the addition of the [[Lion Capital of Asoka]] crest in gold at the centre of the cross. Effective from 15 August 2014, the Indian national motto ''"Satyameva Jayate"'' ("Truth Alone Triumphs") will be added in gold script below the crest, correcting a long-standing omission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/indian-navy-correct-anomaly-satyameva-jayate-pranab-mukherjee-aamir-khan/1/375586.html | title =Indian Navy to finally include Satyameva Jayata below national emblem on its flag and crest | publisher = IndiaToday| date = 8 August 2014 | accessdate = 8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of the British Antarctic Territory.svg|thumb|right|The [[Flag of the British Antarctic Territory]]]]
The [[Flag of the British Antarctic Territory]] is a white ensign defaced with the territory's [[Coat of Arms of the British Antarctic Territory|coat of arms]]. This is the only white ensign in use by a [[British Overseas Territory]].

A White Ensign, without [[Saint Patrick's Saltire]], defaced with a blue lighthouse in the fly, is the Commissioners' flag of the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]]. This flag is unique as it uses a pre-1801 Union Flag in the canton.

The [[burgee]] of the Royal Naval Tot Club of Antigua and Barbuda is sometimes misidentified as a White Ensign; the burgee is a white swallowtail pennant (similar to a [[Royal Navy]] [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]]'s) with the [[Union Flag]] is use until 1801 in the upper hoist canton.

In the 19th and early 20th century, steamers of the [[Furness Railway]] on [[Lake Windemere]] flew the white ensign "as the admiralty only exercised jurisdiction over the high seas" and "repeated requests from the admiralty to desist were met with polite refusals"&lt;ref&gt;Peascod, Herbert &amp; Quayle (2009) "The lake windemere Cruise" Railway Bylines 15/2 Jan 2010, pp54-61&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bahamas]] uses a variant of its white ensign, with a blue cross instead of the red Cross of St George found on the military ensign, as a government and 'non combatant' ensign, serving a similar purpose to the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s [[Blue Ensign]].

[[File:Arnold Böcklin - Das Irrlicht -1882.jpeg|thumb|right|An 1882 [[oil painting]] of a will-o'-the-wisp by [[Arnold Böcklin]].]]

In [[folklore]], a '''will-o'-the-wisp''', '''will-o'-wisp''' or '''''ignis fatuus''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈfa.tu.us|pron}}; [[Medieval Latin]] for "foolish fire") is an [[atmospheric ghost light]] seen by travelers at night, especially over [[bog]]s, [[swamp]]s or [[marsh]]es.  The phenomenon is known in English [[folk belief]], [[English folklore]] and much of [[European folklore]] by a variety of names, including '''[[jack-o'-lantern]]''', '''[[friar]]'s lantern''', '''hinkypunk''' and '''hobby lantern''', and is said to mislead travelers by resembling a flickering lamp or [[lantern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Folk-Lore and Folk-Stories of Wales|first=Marie|last=Trevelyan|location=London|year=1909|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmYHrsC6cYIC&amp;printsec=frontcover|page=178|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In literature, will-o'-the-wisp sometimes have a metaphorical meaning, e.g. describing a [[hope]] or goal that leads one on but is impossible to reach, or something one finds sinister and confounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Will-o'-the-wisp|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|year=2007|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Will-o'-the-wisp appear in folk tales and traditional legends of numerous countries and cultures; notable will-o'-the-wisp include [[St. Louis Light]] in [[Saskatchewan]], [[Marfa light]]s of [[Texas]], the [[Naga fireball]]s on the [[Mekong]] in [[Thailand]], and the [[Hessdalen light]] in [[Norway]]. While [[urban legend]]s, folkore, and [[superstition]] typically attribute will-o'-the-wisps to [[ghost]]s, fairies, or elemental spirits, modern science often explains them as natural phenomena such as [[bioluminescence]] or [[chemiluminescence]], caused by the [[oxidation]] of [[phosphine]] (PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[diphosphane]] (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) produced by [[organic compound|organic]] [[decomposition|decay]].

==Etymology==

[[File:Will-o-the-wisp and snake by Hermann Hendrich 1823.jpg|thumb|The Will o' the Wisp and the Snake by [[Hermann Hendrich]] (1854–1931)]]
The term "will-o'-the-wisp" comes from "wisp", a bundle of sticks or paper sometimes used as a torch, and the name "[[William (name)|Will]]", thus meaning "Will of the torch". The term ''jack-o'-lantern'' (Jack of the lantern) originally referred to a will-o'-the-wisp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Jack+o%27lantern|title=Jack o'lantern (n.)|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, they are often called "spook-lights", "ghost-lights", or "orbs" by folklorists and [[paranormal]] enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spooklights: Where to Find Them|first=Stephen|last=Wagner|url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=2007-12-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022153333/http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm|archivedate=2007-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Floyd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Mysteries: Ghostly lights as common as dew in Dixie|first=Randall|last=Floyd|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/060897/fea_floyd.html|work=[[The Augusta Chronicle]]|year=1997|accessdate=December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moonslipper.com/ghostlightsandorbs.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311080723/http://www.moonslipper.com/ghostlightsandorbs.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 11, 2007|title=Ghost Lights and Orbs|publisher=Moonslipper.com|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk belief attributes the phenomenon to fairies or elemental spirits, explicitly in the term "[[Hob (folklore)|hobby]] lanterns" found in the 19th century [[Denham Tracts]]. In her book ''A Dictionary of Fairies,'' [[Katharine Mary Briggs|K. M. Briggs]] provides an extensive list of other names for the same phenomenon, though the place where they are observed (graveyard, bogs, etc.) influences the naming considerably. When observed in graveyards, they are known as "ghost candles", also a term from the Denham Tracts.

The names ''will-o'-the-wisp'' and ''jack-o'-lantern'' are explained in etiological folk-tales, recorded in many variant forms in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Appalachia]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} In these tales, protagonists named either Will or Jack are doomed to haunt the marshes with a light for some misdeed. One version from [[Shropshire]] is recounted by Briggs in ''A Dictionary of Fairies'' and refers to Will the Smith. Will is a wicked blacksmith who is given a second chance by [[Saint Peter]] at the gates of heaven, but leads such a bad life that he ends up being doomed to wander the earth. The Devil provides him with a single burning coal with which to warm himself, which he then uses to lure foolish travellers into the marshes.

An Irish version of the tale has a ne'er-do-well named Drunk Jack or [[Stingy Jack]] who, when the Devil comes to collect his soul, tricks him into turning into a coin, so he can pay for his one last drink. When the Devil obliges, Jack places him in his pocket next to a crucifix, preventing him from returning to his original form. In exchange for his freedom, the Devil grants Jack ten more years of life. When the term expires, the Devil comes to collect his due. But Jack tricks him again by making him climb a tree and then carving a cross underneath, preventing him from climbing down. In exchange for removing the cross, the Devil forgives Jack's debt. However, no one as bad as Jack would ever be allowed into heaven, so Jack is forced upon his death to travel to hell and ask for a place there. The Devil denies him entrance in revenge but grants him an ember from the fires of hell to light his way through the twilight world to which lost souls are forever condemned. Jack places it in a carved turnip to serve as a lantern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Jack-O-Lantern|first=Mark|last=Hoerrner|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/history-jacko-lantern-irish-tale-halloween.html |work=buzzle.com|year=2006|accessdate=May 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HISTORY OF THE JACK O’LANTERN AND THE LEGEND OF STINGY JACK|author=Leslie O'Malley|publisher=authenticireland.com|url=https://www.authenticireland.com/blog/history-of-the-jack-olantern-and-the-legend-of-stingy-jack/|accessdate=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version of the tale is "Willy the Whisp", related in ''Irish Folktales'' by [[Henry Glassie]]. ''Séadna'' by [[Peadar Ua Laoghaire]] is yet another version—and also the first modern novel in the Irish language.

{{redirect|Feu follet|other uses|Feu follet (disambiguation)}}

[[Mexico]] has two equivalents as well. In one they are called '''brujas''' (witches), folklore explains will-o-the-wisp to be witches who transformed into these lights. The reason for this, however, varies according to the region. Another explanation refers to the lights as indicators to places where gold or hidden treasures are buried which can be found only with the help of children, in this one they are called '''luces del dinero''' (money lights) or '''luces del tesoro''' (treasure lights).

The swampy area of [[Massachusetts]] known as the [[Bridgewater Triangle]] has folklore of ghostly orbs of light, and there have been modern observations of these ghost-lights in this area as well.

The fi follet (or feu-follet) of [[Louisiana]] is derived from the French [[incubus]]/[[succubus]].  The legend says that the fi follet is a soul sent back from the dead to do God's penance, but instead attacks people for vengeance.  While it mostly takes part in harmless mischievous acts, the fi follet sometimes sucked the blood of children.  Some legends say that it was the soul of a child who died before baptism.&lt;ref name="J._Gordon_Melton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Melton|first=J. Gordon|date=1999|title=The Vampire Book|publisher=Visible Ink Press|page=7|isbn=978-1578592814}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vampireunderworld.com/category/types-of-vampires/north-american-vampires/ |title=North American Vampires|publisher=VampireUnderworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Will-o-the-wisp is a part of the folklore in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay.

'''Boi-tatá''' ({{IPA-pt|bojtaˈta}}) is the [[Brazil]]ian equivalent of the will-o'-the-wisp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrabrasileira.net/folclore/regioes/3contos/boitata.html|title=O BOITATÁ|trans-title=The BOITATÁ|website=Terrabrasileira.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218220628/http://www.terrabrasileira.net/folclore/regioes/3contos/boitata.html|archivedate=December 18, 2009|accessdate=November 18, 2011|language=pt|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regionally it is called ''Boitatá'', ''Baitatá'', ''Batatá'', ''Bitatá'', ''Batatão'', ''Biatatá'', ''M'boiguaçu'', ''Mboitatá'' and ''Mbaê-Tata''. The name comes from the [[Old Tupi language]] and means "fiery [[Snake|serpent]]" (''mboî tatá''). Its great fiery eyes leave it almost blind by day, but by night, it can see everything. According to [[legend]], '''Boi-tatá''' was a big serpent which survived a great [[Deluge (mythology)|deluge]]. A "boiguaçu" (a cave anaconda) left its cave after the deluge and, in the dark, went through the fields preying on the animals and corpses, eating exclusively its favorite morsel, the eyes. The collected light from the eaten eyes gave "Boitatá" its fiery gaze. Not really a dragon but a giant snake (in the native language, "boa" or "mboi" or "mboa").

In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] the will-o'-the-wisp phenomenon is known as '''luz mala''' ''(evil light)'' and is one of the most important myths in both countries' folklore. This phenomenon is quite feared and is mostly seen in [[rural areas]]. It consists of an extremely shiny ball of light floating a few inches from the ground.

In [[Colombia]], '''La Candileja''' is the will-o-the-wisp ghost of a vicious grandmother who raised her grandchildren without morals, and as such they became thieves and murderers. In the afterlife the grandmother's spirit was condemned to wander the world surrounded in flames.

'''Aleya''' (or '''marsh ghost-light''') is the name given to a strange light phenomena occurring over the marshes as observed by [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], especially the fishermen of [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]]. This marsh light is attributed to some kind of marsh gas apparitions that confuse fishermen, make them lose their bearings, and may even lead to drowning if one decided to follow them moving over the marshes. Local communities in the region believe that these strange hovering marsh-lights are in fact Ghost-lights representing the ghosts of fisherman who died fishing. Sometimes they confuse the fishermen, and sometimes they help them avoid future dangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pak-times.com/2009/04/07/bengali-ghosts/|title=Bengali Ghosts|first=Ambarish|last=Pandey|work=[[Pakistan Times]]|date=April 7, 2009|accessdate=November 18, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025215051/http://www.pak-times.com/2009/04/07/bengali-ghosts/|archivedate=October 25, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://booksobsession.blogspot.com/2009/10/hbt-guest-post-with-author-saundra.html|title=Blog post by the author Saundra Mitchel of the novel "Shadowed Summer" at Books Obsession|website=Booksobsession.blogspot.com|date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar phenomena are described in Japanese folklore, including '''[[Hitodama]]''' (literally "Human Soul" as a ball of energy), Hi no Tama (Ball of Flame), Aburagae, Koemonbi, Ushionibi, etc. All these phenomena are described as balls of flame or light, at times associated with graveyards, but occurring across Japan as a whole in a wide variety of situations and locations. [[Kitsune]], mythical [[yokai]] demons, are also associated with will 'o the wisp, with the marriage of two kitsune producing  kitsune-bi (狐火), literally meaning 'fox-fire'.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardi, Linda.

In European folklore, these lights are believed to be spirits of the dead, fairies, or a variety of other [[supernatural]] beings which attempt to lead travelers to their demise. Sometimes the lights are believed to be the spirits of unbaptized or stillborn children, flitting between heaven and hell.

In [[Sweden]], the will-o'-the-wisp represents the [[soul]] of an [[baptism|unbaptized]] person "trying to lead travellers to water in the hope of being baptized".&lt;ref&gt;The Element Encyclopedia of Vampires (Theresa Cheung), HarperCollins&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2016}}

[[Danish people|Danes]], [[Finns]], [[Swedish people|Swedes]], [[Estonians]], [[Latvians]], [[Lithuanians]], and Irish people and amongst some other groups believed that a will-o'-the-wisp also marked the location of a treasure deep in ground or water, which could be taken only when the fire was there. Sometimes magical tricks, and even [[Hand of Glory|dead man's hand]], were required as well, to uncover the treasure. In Finland and several other northern countries, it was believed that early autumn was the best time to search for will-o'-the-wisps and treasures below them. It was believed that when someone hid treasure, in the ground, he made the treasure available only at the [[Midsummer|Saint John's Day]], and set will-o'-the-wisp to mark the exact place and time so that he could come to take the treasure back. For then he could be fulfilled with treasures.

The '''Aarnivalkea''', in [[Finnish mythology]], are spots where an eternal flame associated with will o' the wisps burns. They are claimed to mark the places where [[faerie]] [[gold]] is buried. They are protected by a [[Glamour (presentation)|glamour]] that would prevent anyone finding them by pure chance. However, if one finds a fern seed from a mythical flowering [[fern]], the magical properties of that seed will lead the fortunate person to these treasures, in addition to providing one with a glamour of invisibility. Since in reality the fern produces no flower and reproduces via spores under the leaves, the myth specifies that it blooms only extremely rarely.

====Britain====
{{See also|Puck (mythology)}}
The will-o'-the-wisp can be found in numerous folk tales around the [[United Kingdom]], and is often a malicious character in the stories. In [[Welsh language|Welsh]] folklore, it is said that the light is "fairy fire" held in the hand of a [[púca]], or pwca, a small goblin-like fairy that mischievously leads lone travellers off the beaten path at night. As the traveller follows the púca through the marsh or bog, the fire is extinguished, leaving them lost. The púca is said to be one of the [[Tylwyth Teg]], or fairy family. In Wales the light predicts a funeral that will take place soon in the locality. [[Wirt Sikes]] in his book ''British Goblins'' mentions the following [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] tale about púca.

A peasant travelling home at dusk sees a bright light traveling along ahead of him. Looking closer, he sees that the light is a lantern held by a "dusky little figure", which he follows for several miles. All of a sudden he finds himself standing on the edge of a vast chasm with a roaring torrent of water rushing below him. At that precise moment the lantern-carrier leaps across the gap, lifts the light high over its head, lets out a malicious laugh and blows out the light, leaving the poor peasant a long way from home, standing in pitch darkness at the edge of a precipice. This is a fairly common cautionary tale concerning the phenomenon; however, the ignis fatuus was not always considered dangerous. There are some tales told about the will-o'-the-wisp being guardians of treasure, much like the Irish [[leprechaun]] leading those brave enough to follow them to sure riches. Other stories tell of travelers getting lost in the woodland and coming upon a will-o'-the-wisp, and depending on how they treated the will-o'-the-wisp, the spirit would either get them lost further in the woods or guide them out.

Also related, the '''Pixy-light''' from [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] is most often associated with the [[Pixie]] who often has "[[Fairy path|pixie-led]]" travellers away from the safe and reliable route and into the bogs with glowing lights. "Like [[Poltergeist]] they can generate uncanny sounds. They were less serious than their German [[Weisse Frauen]] kin, frequently blowing out candles on unsuspecting courting couples or producing obscene kissing sounds, which were always misinterpreted by parents."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rodneymackay.com/writing/pdf%20files/worldmyth.pdf] [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225001000/http://rodneymackay.com/writing/pdf%20files/worldmyth.pdf|date=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pixy-Light was also associated with "lambent light"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alphadictionary.com/goodword/word/lambent|title=lambent - alphaDictionary * Free English On-line Dictionary |publisher=Alphadictionary.com|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the [[Old Norse]] might have seen guarding their tombs. In Cornish folklore, Pixy-Light also has associations with the [[Colt pixie]]. "A colt pixie is a pixie that has taken the shape of a horse and enjoys playing tricks such as neighing at the other horses to lead them astray".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Shadowdrake.com|url=http://www.shadowdrake.com/waterhorse.html|title=House Shadow Drake - Water Horses and Other Fairy Steeds|accessdate=November 18, 2011|archivedate=September 27, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927144745/http://www.shadowdrake.com/waterhorse.html|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pandius.com/coltpixy.html|title=Colypixy|website=Pandius.com|accessdate= November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Guernsey]], the light is known as the ''faeu boulanger'' (rolling fire), and is believed to be a lost soul. On being confronted with the spectre, tradition prescribes two remedies. The first is to turn one's cap or coat inside out. This has the effect of stopping the faeu boulanger in its tracks. The other solution is to stick a knife into the ground, blade up. The faeu, in an attempt to kill itself, will attack the blade.&lt;ref&gt;Folklore of Guernsey by Marie de Garis (1986) ASIN: B0000EE6P8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The will-o'-the-wisp was also known as the '''Spunkie''' in the [[Scottish Highlands]] where it would take the form of a [[linkboy]] (a boy who carried a flaming torch to light the way for pedestrians in exchange for a fee), or else simply a light that always seemed to recede, in order to lead unwary travelers to their doom.&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;William Grant Stewart (1823). ''The Popular Superstitions and Festive Amusements of the Highlanders of Scotland''. pp.161-162.&lt;/ref&gt; The spunkie has also been blamed for shipwrecks at night after being spotted on land and mistaken for a harbor light.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Katharine Briggs (1976). ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies''. [[Pantheon Books]]. p. 381. {{ISBN|0-394-40918-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tales of Scottish folklore regard these mysterious lights as omens of death or the ghosts of once living human beings. They often appeared over lochs &lt;ref name=Alasdair&gt;Alasdair Alpin MacGregor (1937). ''The Peat Fire Flame: Folktales and Traditions of the Highlands and Islands''.

The [[Australia]]n equivalent, known as the '''Min Min light''' is reportedly seen in parts of the outback after dark.&lt;ref name=perrigrew1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pettigrew, John D. |title=The Min Min light and the Fata Morgana.

==Natural explanations==

In modern science, it is generally accepted that will-o'-the-wisp phenomena (ignis fatuus) are caused by the [[oxidation]] of [[phosphine]] (PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[diphosphane]] (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). These compounds, produced by [[organic compound|organic]] [[Decomposition|decay]], can cause [[photon]] emissions. Since phosphine and diphosphane mixtures spontaneously ignite on contact with the oxygen in air, only small quantities of it would be needed to ignite the much more abundant methane to create ephemeral fires.&lt;ref name="roels2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Joris Roels &amp; Willy Verstrae|year=2001|title=Biological formation of volatile phosphorus compounds|journal=Bioresource Technology|volume=79|pages=243&amp;ndash;250|publisher=Elsevier|url=http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/ckhachi/phosphorous/Roels_2001.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0960-8524(01)00032-3|pmid=11499578|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919012514/http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/ckhachi/phosphorous/Roels_2001.pdf|archivedate=2006-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, phosphine produces [[phosphorus pentoxide]] as a by-product, which forms [[phosphoric acid]] upon contact with water vapor, which can explain "viscous moisture" sometimes described as accompanying ignis fatuus.

In 1776, [[Alessandro Volta]] first proposed that natural electrical phenomena (like [[lightning]]) interacting with [[methane]] marsh gas may be the cause of ignis fatuus.&lt;ref name="volta"&gt;{{cite book|first=Marco|last=Ciardi|editor =Fabio Bevilacqua &amp; Lucio Fregonese|title =Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and His Times|chapter =Falling Stars, Instruments and Myths: Volta and the Birth of Modern Meteorology|publisher =Editore Ulrico Hoepli|year =2000|page=43|url =http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Nuova%20Voltiana3_PDF/cap2/2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by the British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]] in his series of works ''[[Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air]]'' (1772–1790); and by the French physicist [[Pierre Bertholon de Saint-Lazare]] in ''De l’électricité des météores'' (1787).&lt;ref name=tomlinson&gt;{{cite journal|first=Charles|last=Tomlinson|publisher= Witherby &amp; Co.|year=1893|title=On Certain Low-Lying Meteors|editor=A. Cowper Ranyard|journal=[[Knowledge (magazine)|Knowledge: An Illustrated Magazine of Science.

Early critics of the marsh gas hypothesis often dismissed it on various grounds including the unlikeliness of spontaneous combustion, the absence of warmth in some observed ignis fatuus, the odd behavior of ignis fatuus receding upon being approached, and the differing accounts of [[ball lightning]] (which was also classified as a kind of ignis fatuus).&lt;ref name=tomlinson/&gt; An example of such criticism is the following by the American anthropologist [[John G. Owens]] in ''Folk-Lore from Buffalo Valley'' (1891):

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a name that is sometimes applied to a phenomenon perhaps more frequently called Jack-o'-the-Lantern, or Will-o'-the-Wisp. It seems to be a ball of fire, varying in size from that of a candle-flame to that of a man's head. It is generally observed in damp, marshy places, moving to and fro; but it has been known to stand perfectly still and send off scintillations. As you approach it, it will move on, keeping just beyond your reach; if you retire, it will follow you. That these fireballs do occur, and that they will repeat your motion, seems to be established, but no satisfactory explanation has yet been offered that I have heard. Those who are less superstitious say that it is the ignition of the gases rising from the marsh. But how a light produced from burning gas could have the form described and move as described, advancing as you advance, receding as you recede, and at other times remaining stationary, without having any visible connection with the earth, is not clear to me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Owens J.G. | year = 1891 | title = Folk-Lore from Buffalo Valley | url = | journal = Journal of American Folk-Lore | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 123–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the apparent retreat of ignis fatuus upon being approached might be explained simply by the agitation of the air by nearby moving objects, causing the gases to disperse. This was observed in the very detailed accounts of several close interactions with ignis fatuus published earlier in 1832 by Major Louis Blesson after a series of experiments in various localities where they were known to occur.&lt;ref name="blesson"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Louis|last=Blesson|year=1832–1833|title=Observations on the Ignis Fatuus, or Will-with-the-Wisp, Falling Stars, and Thunder Storms|journal=The Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal|volume=14|pages=90&amp;ndash;94|publisher=Neill &amp; Company|url=http://inamidst.com/lights/wisp/blesson1832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of note is his first encounter with ignis fatuus in a marshland between a deep valley in the forest of Gorbitz, [[Neumark|Newmark]], Germany. Blesson observed that the water was covered by an iridescent film, and during day-time, bubbles could be observed rising abundantly from certain areas. At night, Blesson observed bluish-purple flames in the same areas and concluded that it was connected to the rising gas. He spent several days investigating the phenomenon, finding to his dismay that the flames retreated every time he tried to approach them. He eventually succeeded and was able to confirm that the lights were indeed caused by ignited gas. The British scientist [[Charles Tomlinson (scientist)|Charles Tomlinson]] in ''On Certain Low-Lying Meteors'' (1893) describes Blesson's experiments as thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On visiting the spot at night, the sensitive flames retired as the major advanced; but on standing quite still, they returned, and he tried to light a piece of paper at them, but the current of air produced by his breath kept them at too great a distance. On turning away his head, and screening his breath, he succeeded in setting fire to the paper. He was also able to extinguish the flame by driving it before him to a part of the ground where no gas was produced; then applying a flame to the place whence the gas issued, a kind of explosion was heard over eight or nine square feet of the marsh; a red light was seen, which faded to a blue flame about three feet high, and this continued to burn with an unsteady motion. As the morning dawned the flames became pale, and they seemed to approach nearer and nearer to the earth, until at last they faded from sight.&lt;ref name=tomlinson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blesson also observed differences in the color and heat of the flames in different marshes. The ignis fatuus in Malapane, [[Upper Silesia]] (now [[Ozimek]], [[Poland]]) could be ignited and extinguished, but were unable to burn pieces of paper or wood shavings. Similarly, the ignis fatuus in another forest in Poland coated pieces of paper and wood shavings with an oily viscous fluid instead of burning them. Blesson also accidentally created ignis fatuus in the marshes of [[Porta Westfalica]], Germany, while launching [[fireworks]].&lt;ref name=tomlinson/&gt;&lt;ref name=blesson/&gt;

One attempt to replicate ignis fatuus under laboratory conditions was in 1980 by British geologist Alan A. Mills of [[Leicester University]]. Though he did succeed in creating a cool glowing cloud by mixing crude phosphine and natural gas, the color of the light was green and it produced copious amounts of acrid smoke. This was contrary to most eyewitness accounts of ignis fatuus.&lt;ref name="mills"&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. A. Mills|year=2000|title=Will-o'-the-wisp revisited|journal=Weather|volume=55|issue=7|pages=20&amp;ndash;26|publisher=[[Royal Meteorological Society]]|doi=10.1002/j.1477-8696.2000.tb04067.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1477-8696.2000.tb04067.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paleo/&gt; As an alternative, Mills proposed in 2000 that ignis fatuus may instead be [[Cool flame|cold flame]]s.&lt;ref name=mills/&gt;&lt;ref name=garl/&gt; These are luminescent pre-combustion halos that occur when various compounds are heated to just below [[ignition point]]. Cold flames are indeed typically bluish in color and as their name suggests, they generate very little heat. Cold flames occur in a wide variety of compounds, including [[hydrocarbons]] (including methane), [[alcohols]], [[aldehydes]], [[oils]], [[acids]], and even [[waxes]]. However it is unknown if cold flames occur naturally, though a lot of compounds which exhibit cold flames are the natural byproducts of organic decay.&lt;ref name="mills"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasa&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BwKdl5NHALUC&amp;pg=PA142|title=Cool Flames and Autoignition: Thermal-Ingnition Theory of Combustion Experimentally Validated in Microgravity|last=Pearlman|first=Howard|author2=Chapek, Richard M.|year=1999|publisher=[[NASA]]|page=142|isbn=1-4289-1823-X}}, [http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/RT1999/6000/6711wu.html Web version at NASA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501223626/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/RT1999/6000/6711wu.html |date=2010-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related hypothesis involves the natural [[chemiluminescence]] of phosphine. In 2008, the Italian chemists Luigi Garlaschelli and Paolo Boschetti attempted to recreate Mills' experiments. They successfully created a faint cool light by mixing phosphine with air and nitrogen. Though the glow was still greenish in color, Garlaschelli and Boschetti noted that under low-light conditions, the human eye cannot easily distinguish between colors. Furthermore, by adjusting the concentrations of the gases and the environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.), it was possible to eliminate the smoke and smell, or at least render it to undetectable levels. Garlaschelli and Boschetti also agreed with Mills that cold flames may also be a plausible explanation for other instances of ignis fatuus.&lt;ref name="garl"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luigi Garlaschelli &amp; Paolo Boschetti|title=On the track of the will-o'-the-wisp|publisher=Dipartimento di Chimica Organica, Università di Pavia|url=https://44cc653b-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/luigigarlaschelli/WILLOWISexperiments.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cpHRffGlOiCwYxPlrtxd2lTvwsEAMQGgBpRGfI7Y-FSRb5um5lKbRMP0MRniEcJQNazW1rv21_sSUv0z7rcprszClTsadRbFE9Xxy71H_KwKf664KGyQh4qSTmVURo7yIbcG-UcqktElznNxbFHiFZam7ecLQ5N84AxbnmVOkSFpPCDVt4dGztZ6nrMoge0hmnLMmTcRKu7R2IjvyKV2bpVc41_YKLiXIUHE12qr2wabmq33J8%3D&amp;attredirects=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, professors Derr and Persinger proposed that some ignis fatuus may be geologic in origin, [[piezoelectric]]ally generated under [[tectonics|tectonic]] strain. The strains that move faults would also heat up the rocks, vaporizing the water in them. Rock or soil containing something piezoelectric, like [[quartz]], [[silicon]], or [[arsenic]], may also produce [[electricity]], channeled up to the surface through the soil via a column of vaporized water, there somehow appearing as earth lights. This would explain why the lights appear electrical, erratic, or even intelligent in their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|authorlink=Michael Persinger|title=Perceptual and Motor Skills|series="Geophysical variables and behavior: LXXIV. Man-made fluid injections into the crust and reports of luminous phenomena (UFO Reports)&amp;nbsp;— Is the strain field an aseismically propagating hydrological pulse?"|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Derr|first=J.S.|authorlink=J.S. Derr|title=Perceptual and Motor Skills|series="Seasonal hydrological load and regional luminous phenomena (UFO reports) within river systems: the Mississippi Valley test."|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The will-o'-the-wisp phenomena may occur due to the [[bioluminescence]] of various forest dwelling micro-organisms and insects.  The eerie glow emitted from certain fungal species, such as the [[honey fungus]], during chemical reactions to form white rot could be mistaken for the mysterious will-o'-the-wisp or [[foxfire]] lights.  There are many other bioluminescent organisms that could create the illusions of fairy lights, such as [[fireflies]].  Light reflecting off larger forest dwelling creatures could explain the phenomena of will-o'-the-wisp moving and reacting to other lights.  The white plumage of [[Barn owl]]s may reflect enough light from the moon to appear as a will-o'-the-wisp; hence the possibility of the lights moving, reacting to other lights, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owlpages.com/articles.php?section=Studies+and+Papers&amp;title=Min+Min A Review of accounts of luminosity in Barn Owls ''Tyto alba''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignis fatuus sightings are rarely reported today. The decline is believed to be the result of the draining and reclamation of swamplands in recent centuries, such as the formerly vast [[The Fens|Fenlands]] of eastern England which have now been converted to farmlands.&lt;ref name="paleo"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jan|last=Zalasiewicz|year=2007|editor=Richard Twitchett|title=The spirit of biodiversity|journal=The Paleontology Newsletter|issue=64|pages=20&amp;ndash;26|url=http://newsletter.palass-pubs.org/pdf/News64.pdf|archivedate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727184243/http://newsletter.palass-pubs.org/pdf/News64.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Winter Fields''''' is a 1942 painting by the American artist [[Andrew Wyeth]]. It depicts a dead, frozen crow in a landscape with fields and distant farm buildings.

Wyeth had found the crow near his home in [[Chadds Ford Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Chadds Ford]], Pennsylvania and brought it to his studio where he painted it in detail. It was painted with [[tempera]] on composition board.&lt;ref name="whitney"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collection.whitney.org/object/3362|title=Andrew Wyeth: Winter Fields|publisher=[[Whitney Museum of American Art]]|accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it was made during [[World War II]], the painting has often been interpreted as an allusion to the ongoing battles. It has also been seen as an allusion to battles during the [[American Revolutionary War]] that took place in Brandywine Valley of Pennsylvania, as Wyeth was known for his interest in local history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIaagXxZN7UC&amp;pg=PA100|title=Frames of Reference: Looking at American Art, 1900-1950: Works from the Whitney Museum of American Art|pp=100–101|isbn=0-520-21888-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Ken Johnson (art critic)|Ken Johnson]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewed an exhibition where ''Winter Fields'' was included, and wrote about a recurring theme in 20th-century art of declining spirituality: "''Winter Fields'', a painting that Andrew Wyeth made in 1942 when he was leaning toward [[Magic realism|Magic Realism]], puts it more succinctly. With the exacting touch and the pagan religiosity of a [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]], he pictured a dead crow among dry, brown grasses, a baleful symbol for civilization at war with itself, a silent scream against the violent idiocy of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Johnson|first=Ken|authorlink=Ken Johnson (art critic)|date=2011-10-28|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/arts/design/real-surreal-at-the-whitney-review.html|title=Jewels of Uneasiness, Faithfully Rendered|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is hosted at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="whitney" /&gt;

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 038.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A wise old man: "Philosopher in Meditation" by [[Rembrandt]]]]
The '''wise old man''' (also called '''senex''', [[Sage (philosophy)|'''sage''' or '''sophos''']]) is an [[archetype]] as described by [[Carl Jung]], as well as a classic [[literature|literary]] figure, and may be seen as a [[stock character]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p 151, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wise old man can be a profound [[philosopher]] distinguished for [[wisdom]] and sound [[judgment]].

== Traits ==
This type of character is typically represented as a kind and wise, older father-type figure who uses personal knowledge of people and the world to help tell stories and offer guidance that, in a mystical way, may impress upon his audience a sense of who they are and who they might become, thereby acting as a [[mentor]].  He may occasionally appear as an [[absent-minded professor]], appearing absent-minded due to a predilection for contemplative pursuits.

The wise old man is often seen to be in some way "foreign", that is, from a different culture, nation, or occasionally, even a different time, from those he advises.  In extreme cases, he may be a [[liminal being]], such as [[Merlin]], who was only half human.

In medieval chivalric [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] and modern [[fantasy literature]], he is often presented as a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]].&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'', p 195, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He can also or instead be featured as a [[hermit]].  This character type often explained to the [[Monomyth|knights or heroes]]—particularly those searching for the [[Holy Grail]]—the significance of their encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Penelope Reed |last=Doob |title=The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell University Press |pages=179–181 |isbn=0-8014-8000-0 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In storytelling, the character of the wise old man is commonly killed or in some other way removed for a time, in order to allow the hero to develop on his/her own.

== Jungian psychology ==

In [[Carl Jung|Jung]]ian [[analytical psychology]], '''senex''' is the specific term used in association with this archetype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Terrapsychology: Reengaging the Soul of Place|last= Chalquist|first= Craig|year= 2007|publisher= Spring Journal Books|isbn= 978-1-882670-65-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Rome, the title of Senex ([[Latin]] for ''old man'') was only awarded to elderly men with families who had good standing in their village. Examples of the senex [[archetype]] in a positive form include the wise old man or [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]. The senex may also appear in a negative form as a devouring [[father]] (e.g. [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], [[Cronus]]) or a doddering [[Foolishness|fool]].

In the [[individuation]] process, the archetype of the Wise old man was late to emerge, and seen as an indication of the [[Self (Jung)|Self]].  'If an individual has wrestled seriously enough and long enough with the [[anima and animus|anima]] (or animus) problem...the unconscious again changes its dominant character and appears in a new symbolic form...as a masculine initiator and guardian (an Indian ''guru''), a wise old man, a spirit of nature, and so forth'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Marie-Luise von |last=Franz |chapter=The Process of Individuation |editor-first=C. G. |editor-last=Jung |editor-link=Carl Gustav Jung |title=Man and his Symbols |location=London |publisher=Picador |year=1978 |pages=207–208 |isbn=0-330-25321-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antithetical archetype, or [[enantiodromia|enantiodromic opposite]], of the senex is the [[Puer Aeternus]].

== Cultural references ==

In fiction, due to the influence of [[Merlin]], a wise old man is often presented in the form of a wizard or other [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] in medieval chivalric [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] and  modern [[fantasy literature]] and [[films]]; notable examples include [[Gandalf]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and [[Albus Dumbledore]] from ''[[Harry Potter]]''. See List of magicians in fantasy for more examples.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The Elder Kettle, who serves as a father figure to the Cup Brothers in ''[[Cuphead]]'', closely follows this role. When the brothers get roped into The Devil's scheme to gather the contracts, it is the Elder Kettle who helps the brothers in their plan to eventually turn against their master.

"Senex" is a name of a wise old character in the novel ''[[A Wind in the Door]]'' by [[Madeleine L'Engle]].

Sir [[Alan Lascelles]] used the pen-name "Senex" when writing to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1950 setting out the so-called [[Lascelles Principles]] concerning the monarch's right to refuse a prime minister's request for a general election.

A character in episode 7 of the anime [[Ergo Proxy]]  is named Senex Proxy, and is the Agent of Moonlight. She is killed by Ergo Proxy. It is possible the name Senex is in reference to the age, and immortality of the Proxies.

In the roleplaying game [[Mage: The Ascension]], Senex is the wise old leader of the Euthanatos magickal tradition. He dwells in a far distant realm, only rarely stepping onto Earth.
