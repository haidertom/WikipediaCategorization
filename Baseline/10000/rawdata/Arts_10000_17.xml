The year '''1967 in film''' involved some significant events. It is widely considered as one of the most ground-breaking years in film, with "revolutionary" films highlighting the change, including: ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', ''[[The Graduate]]'', ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'', ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'', ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'', and ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Mark|title=Pictures at a revolution : five movies and the birth of the new Hollywood|date=2009|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0143115038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
* The prototype for the [[IMAX]] large-format-film acquisition and screening system is exhibited at [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada
* The MPAA adopts a new logo, which is still used today.
* July 15 ‚Äî [[Seven Arts Productions]] acquire substantially all the assets and business of [[Warner Bros.]] creating [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]]. 
* August 13 ‚Äî ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', starring [[Warren Beatty]], [[Faye Dunaway]], and [[Gene Hackman]], premieres. It broke many taboos of its time, such as the visual depiction of violence. It has been considered a landmark film in Hollywood filmmaking, with its groundbreaking and ingenious visual styles. The success of ''Bonnie and Clyde'' helped bring forth the [[New Hollywood]] era, a period of artistic and commercial renewal.
* October 18 ‚Äî [[Walt Disney]]'s production of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' premieres. It was the last animated feature film to be personally supervised by Disney before his death the previous year. It was also one of the last Disney films to be personally approved by him, along with ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]]'' and ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]''. The story's moral message of friendship, love, and trust have been embraced by critics and audiences worldwide. ''The Jungle Book'' is notable for its realistic character animation and voice casting. [[The Jungle Book (soundtrack)|The film's soundtrack]], which includes the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]]-nominated "[[The Bare Necessities]]", '"[[I Wan'na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)|I Wan'na Be Like You]]", "Trust in Me", and "[[My Own Home]]", also contributed to the film's enormous success. It would be the most successful animated film to be made by Disney until ''[[The Rescuers]]'', ten years later.
* December 21 ‚Äî ''[[The Graduate]]'', starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] (in his acting film debut), [[Anne Bancroft]], and [[Katharine Ross]], premieres. It tells a story of an aimless young man, seduced and betrayed by an older woman, while falling in love with her daughter. The theme of an innocent and confused youth who is exploited, misdirected, seduced (literally and figuratively) and betrayed by a corrupt, decadent, and discredited older generation (that finds its stability in the film's keyword "plastics") was well understood by film audiences and captured the spirit of the times, in light of the  [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1963]] and the increasing turbulence in American society in the mid-to-late 1960s. Like ''Bonnie and Clyde'', ''The Graduate'' broke many well-established [[taboo]]s in American cinema, and represents a new era in groundbreaking achievements in filmmaking.

__NOTOC__
{{Wiktionary|Adam and Steve}}

"'''Adam and Steve'''" is a [[phrase]] that originated from a conservative Christian slogan "God made [[Adam and Eve]], not Adam and Steve", intended to concisely summarize [[Judeo-Christian]] Bible-based arguments against [[gay sexual practices]] or [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Clarke | first = Victoria | title = What about the children? arguments against lesbian and gay parenting | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 555‚Äì570 | publisher = [[ScienceDirect]] | doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(01)00193-5 | date = September‚ÄìOctober 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0277-5395(01)00193-5 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other things, it implies that the natural way of life for humanity is illustrated by the Biblical account of the [[Genesis (Bible)|creation]] of human beings as a male-female pair. The phrase "'''Madam and Eve'''" is sometimes used in reference to [[lesbian]] relationships. In Portuguese, the phrase is rendered as ''"Deus criou Ad√£o e Eva, n√£o Ad√£o e Ivo".''

== History ==
The phrase appeared, on a protest sign, as early as 1977, as mentioned in a ''New York Times'' news service report about a November 19 rally in Houston that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Klemesrud |first=Judy |authorlink=Judy Lee Klemesrud |title=Equal Rights Plan and Abortion Are Opposed by 15,000 at Rally |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/20/archives/equal-rights-plan-and-abortion-are-opposed-by-15000-at-rally-like-a.html |work=New York Times |date=November 20, 1977 |accessdate=2008-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was used in "The Gay Bar", an episode of ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' broadcast on December 3, 1977. Two years later, [[Jerry Falwell]] gave the phrase wider circulation in a ''[[Christianity Today]]'' report of a press conference he had given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Balch | first = David | title = Homosexuality, science, and the "plain sense" of Scripture | publisher = Wm. B. Eerdmans | location = Grand Rapids, Mich | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-8028-4698-3 | page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase later acquired a certain notoriety, and, when used to name a pair of characters in a work of fiction, helps to identify them as members of a homosexual pair ([[Paul Rudnick]]'s play ''The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hurwitt | first = Robert | title = Adam and Steve's adventures in paradise | work = San Francisco Chronicle | page = E4 | date = 21 May 2001 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Adam-and-Steve-s-adventures-in-paradise-2919586.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2005 film ''[[Adam &amp; Steve]]'' and other works). The phrase was used by the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] MP [[David Simpson (Northern Ireland politician)|David Simpson]] during the British [[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]]' [[Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Bill|debate on same-sex marriage]], although a slip of the tongue originally saying "in the Garden of Eden, it was Adam and Steve" initially caused laughter in the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hennessy | first = Mark | title = British MPs back gay marriage legislation | work = The Irish Times | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2013/0206/1224329707241.html | date = 6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coat of Arms of Tatarstan.svg|thumb|''Aq Bars'' or [[Snow Leopard]]. Symbol of the Russian republic of [[Tatarstan]].]]
'''''Aq Bars''''' (or  ''Ak Bars'') ([[Cyrillic]]: –ê–∫ –ë–∞—Ä—Å) is the emblem of [[Tatarstan]]. It is an ancient [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] symbol translated as "White Leopard" or "[[Snow Leopard]]", and has been in use since 1991 as the official symbol of Tatarstan.

Historically, this symbol was used in [[Volga Bulgaria]] and the [[Khanate of Kazan]] ([[Kazan|Qazan]]) - predecessors of Tatarstan - as a state symbol. The snow leopard symbol comes from the totems of one of the [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] tribes - the [[Barsil]]. According to legend, the Barsils founded [[Bil√§r]] in [[Volga Bulgaria]].

The creator of the current emblem is the artist Rif Z√§gri ulƒ± F√§xretdinev.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2557">'''Beast poetry''', in the context of [[European literature]] and [[medieval studies]], refers to a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of [[poem]]s written in [[Latin]] from the 8th to the 11th century.

These poems draw upon an ancient literary tradition of  [[anthropomorphic]] animals dating back into [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] and exemplified by [[Aesop]].  They are the immediate foundation for the flowering of [[Reynard]] literature that occurred in the 12th century.  Elements from beast poetry have been adapted into subsequent works ranging from the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' to contemporary [[movie]]s made with [[computer animation]].

Although it makes sense to discuss beast poetry as a single corpus of literature, they do not form a [[genre]] but rather:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The medieval Latin poems have few immediately discernible traits in common with one another. They were not the products of the same time or region. They range greatly in length... In structure, a beast poem can be as humble as one speech by a bird struggling to fly home safely... but then again it can intertwine a dozen main stories and another dozen visions, reminiscences, and divagations... The beast poems were created for many occasions and audiences... to be pored over in the library... read aloud, sung, and staged... Some were perhaps scripts for schoolroom performances... others for recitation in the refectory.&lt;ref&gt;Jan M. Ziolkowski. Talking Animals: Medieval Latin Beast Poetry,
750-1150.  Middle Ages Series. Philadelphia: University of
Pennsylvania Press, 1993. Pp. viii, 354. {{ISBN|0-8122-3161-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary''''' is a prose translation of the early medieval epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' from [[Old English]] to modern English language. Translated by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] from 1920 to 1926, it was edited by Tolkien's son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] and published posthumously in May 2014 by [[HarperCollins]].

In the poem, [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], a hero of the [[Geats]] in Scandinavia, comes to the aid of [[Hro√∞gar]], the king of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], whose [[mead hall]] [[Heorot]] has been under attack by a monster known as [[Grendel]].  After Beowulf slays him, [[Grendel's mother]] attacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to [[Geatland]] in Sweden and later becomes king of the Geats. After fifty years have passed, Beowulf defeats a [[dragon]], but is fatally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants bury him in a [[tumulus]], a burial mound, in Geatland.

The translation is followed by a commentary on the poem that became the base for Tolkien's acclaimed 1936 lecture "[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics|''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics]]".&lt;ref name="BBC 2014-03-20"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-26662761 |title=JRR Tolkien's Beowulf translation to be published |work=[[BBC News]] |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the book includes the previously unpublished "[[Sellic Spell]]" and two versions of "The Lay of ''Beowulf''". The former is a fantasy piece on Beowulf's biographical background while the latter is a poem on the ''Beowulf'' theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-544-44278-8 |title=Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary  |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=26 May 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{main article|Beowulf}}

Beowulf, a prince of the Geats, and his followers set out to help king Hro√∞gar of the Danes in his fight against the monster Grendel. Because Grendel hates music and noise he frequently attacks Hro√∞gar's mead hall [[Heorot]] killing the king's men in their sleep. While Beowulf cannot kill Grendel directly in their first encounter, he still wounds him fatally. Afterwards he has to face Grendel's mother who has come to avenge her son. Beowulf follows her to a cavern beneath a lake where he slays her with a magical sword. There he also finds the dying Grendel and decapitates him.

Beowulf returns home to become king of the Geats. After some 50 years, a dragon whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in a burial mound begins to terrorize Geatland. Beowulf, now in his eighties, tries to fight the dragon but cannot succeed. He follows the dragon to his lair where Beowulf's young relative [[Wiglaf]] joins him in the fight. Eventually, Beowulf slays the dragon but is mortally wounded. In the end, his followers bury their king in a mound by the sea.

==Reception==
Tolkien's translation of ''Beowulf'' has been compared to [[Seamus Heaney]]'s translation from 2000. [[Joan Acocella]] writes that since Tolkien was not a professional poet like Heaney, he had to make compromises in translating the original Old English epic. According to Acocella, Heaney's focus on rhyme and [[alliteration]] makes him occasionally lose details from the original that remain in Tolkien's prose version.&lt;ref name=Acocella&gt;{{cite journal|title=Slaying Monsters: Tolkien's 'Beowulf' |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2014/06/02/140602crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all|first=Joan |last=Acocella |authorlink=Joan Acocella |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=2 June 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien's version stays closer to the details and rhythm of the original and also very close to the original sense of the poem, which has been attributed to Tolkien's scholarly knowledge of Old English, whereas Heaney, on the other hand, succeeded in producing a translation suited for the modern reader, more so than Tolkien's.&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt;&lt;ref name=Worall&gt;{{cite news|title=Tolkien's Beowulf: a 'great gift' |first=Patrick |last=Worrall |work=[[Channel 4]] |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014 |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/tolkiens-beowulf-a-great-gift}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication also caused some controversy among scholars. ''Beowulf'' expert and University of Kentucky professor [[Kevin Kiernan]], called it a "travesty", and criticism was also offered by [[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor Daniel Donoghue.&lt;ref name="hwaet"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/hwt-a-new-academic-spat-over-tolkien-9409559.html|title=Hw√¶t? a new academic spat over Tolkien|date=21 May 2014|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Business Insider]]'', Kiernan cites J. R. R. Tolkien himself who disliked his own translation. According to Kiernan, any prose translation of Beowulf will neglect the "poetic majesty" of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Tolkien Hated His Translation Of Beowulf |first=Kevin |last=Kiernan |authorlink=Kevin Kiernan |work=[[Business Insider]] |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/beowulf-is-so-hard-to-translate-even-jrr-tolkien-hated-his-version-2014-6 |date=2 June 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Birmingham]] lecturer Philippa Semper instead called the translation "captivating" and "a great gift to anyone interested in Beowulf or Tolkien."&lt;ref name=Worall/&gt;

Writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Ethan Gilsdorf]] comments that Tolkien had been skeptical about putting ''Beowulf'' into modern English, and had written in his 1940 essay ''[[On Translating Beowulf]]'' that turning the poem "into 'plain prose' could be an 'abuse'."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilsdorf|first1=Ethan|authorlink=Ethan Gilsdorf|title=Waving His Wand at ‚ÄòBeowulf‚Äô|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/books/jrr-tolkiens-translation-of-beowulf-is-published.html?_r=1|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2 December 2014|date=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilsdorf continues, "But he did it anyway"; Tolkien remarking that the result "was 'hardly to my liking'."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Background and legacy==
J. R. R. Tolkien specialized in English [[philology]] at university and in 1915 graduated with [[Old Norse]] as special subject. In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the [[University of Leeds]], where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of [[linguistics]] from five to twenty. He gave courses in Old English [[heroic verse]], [[history of English]], various [[Old English]] and [[Middle English]] texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] philology, [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Icelandic]], and [[Middle Welsh language|Medieval Welsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=letter No. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having read ''Beowulf'' earlier, he began a translation of the poem which he finished in 1926 but never published. Acocella writes that Tolkien may not have had the time to pursue a publication when he moved to [[Oxford]] and began to write his novel ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Tolkien's biographer [[Humphrey Carpenter]] argues also that Tolkien was too much of a perfectionist to publish his translation.&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt;

Ten years later, however, Tolkien drew upon this work when he gave a lecture "[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics|''Beowulf'': The Monster and the Critics]]". According to this lecture, the true theme of ''Beowulf'', namely death and defeat, was being neglected in favour of archaeological and philological disputes on how much of the poem was fictive or true.&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt;

===Influences on ''The Hobbit''===
Tolkien described ''Beowulf'' as one of the "most valued sources" for ''[[The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref name=Letter25&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=letter No. 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain descriptions in ''The Hobbit'' seem to have been lifted straight out of ''Beowulf'' with some minor rewording, such as when each dragon stretches out its neck to sniff for intruders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Faraci | first=Mary | editor-first=Jane | editor-last=Chance | title=Tolkien the Medievalist | publisher=Routledge |year=2002 | pages=58‚Äì59 | chapter='I wish to speak' (Tolkien's voice in his Beowulf essay) | isbn=0-415-28944-0 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=sNTI0WTNmw4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Tolkien's descriptions of the lair as accessed through a secret passage mirror those in ''Beowulf''. Other specific plot elements and features in ''The Hobbit'' that show similarities to ''Beowulf'' include the title ''thief'' as [[Bilbo Baggins]] is called by [[Gollum]] and later also by Smaug, and Smaug's personality which leads to the destruction of Lake-town.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Solopova|p. 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien refines parts of ''Beowulf''{{'s}} plot that he appears to have found less than satisfactorily described, such as details about the cup-thief and the dragon's intellect and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Purtill | first=Richard L. |authorlink=Richard Purtill | title=Lord of the Elves and Eldils | publisher=Ignatius Press |year=2006 |pages=53‚Äì55 | isbn=1-58617-084-8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cbcuwO3bwfgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; By his naming his sword "[[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]]" one can see Bilbo's acceptance of the kinds of cultural and linguistic practices found in ''Beowulf'', signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = McDonald | first = R. Andrew | first2 = K. S. | last2 = Whetter | year = 2006 | title = 'In the hilt is fame': resonances of medieval swords and sword-lore in J. R. R.

As Tolkien wrote, "The episode of the theft arose naturally (and almost inevitably) from the circumstances. It is difficult to think of any other way of conducting the story at this point. I fancy the author of ''Beowulf'' would say much the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9309">The '''Christchurch Dragon''' is a [[legend]] associated with the town of [[Christchurch, Dorset]], on the south coast of England. The legend has its origin in a mid-12th century French manuscript written by [[H√©riman of Tournai |Hermann de Tournai]], which tells how a party of [[Canon (priest)|canons]] from the [[Laon Cathedral|cathedral of Notre-Dame]] in [[Laon]], France, witnessed a five-headed [[dragon]] destroy the church and much of the town. Although well-documented, the legend is little-known in the town of its origin.

==Legend synopsis==

In Hermann de Tournai‚Äôs account, a party of nine canons on a fund-raising tour from Laon Cathedral arrive at the town of Christchurch during a torrential rainstorm. They seek shelter at the local minster church but are rejected by the dean, who claims that the doors of the newly-built church are not yet secure. In truth, the dean is concerned that their shrine and holy relics of the Virgin Mary would collect more offerings than his own altars.

Being the Saturday after [[Pentecost]], the canons have arrived on the eve of the town‚Äôs annual fair, so all the inns and lodging houses are full with merchants. However, one group of merchants kindly vacate their rooms in a newly-built lodging house. The merchants then attend mass held at the house by the canons and agree to shun the church.

That night the canons tend to a poor herdsman‚Äôs daughter who had been born with a deformed foot. The girl spends the night in prayer before the canons‚Äô portable altar and the following morning her foot is found to be miraculously healed.

Later that morning the merchants all go to the fair. The canons depart from the town, but before they have travelled very far they are overtaken by two horsemen who tell them that the town is being set ablaze by a terrible dragon that had flown in from the sea. Eager to see this incredible spectacle, the canons race back to Christchurch.

The dragon is seen to be incredibly long and have five heads from which it breathes sulphurous flames. It is setting houses alight one by one, but the canons are astonished to find that the lodging house and herdsman‚Äôs shelter are both completely unscathed and their occupants are safe inside. The kindly merchants have also all escaped unharmed, having departed from the fair early, before the dragon had appeared. However, the church where the canons had been denied shelter has been entirely destroyed.

The uncharitable dean is seen trying to save all his most valuable possessions by loading them on board a boat on the nearby river, but the dragon then swoops down and reduces the boat and everything onboard to ashes. The repentant dean subsequently prostrates himself before the canon‚Äôs shrine and prays to be forgiven for all the wrong he had done.

==History==

The background story to the canons‚Äô visit is described in Monodies (Book 3), a contemporary document written by [[Guibert de Nogent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Monodies and On the Relics of Saints |pages=153‚Äì154|last=Guibert of Nogent|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd |isbn=978-0-14-310630-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mentions the fund-raising journeys undertaken by the canons of Laon after the cathedral of Notre-Dame was badly damaged by fire during a civil uprising at Easter in 1112. In Chapter XIII Guibert refers to the burning of an unnamed English town visited by the canons, but he ascribes this to lightning heaven-sent as a punishment for the ungodly behaviour of the inhabitants and makes no mention of a dragon. 

In the mid-12th century, Herman de Laon, otherwise [[H√©riman of Tournai |Hermann de Tournai]], a retired Flemish Abbot, elaborated on the canons‚Äô English journey in De Miraculis Sanctae Mariae Laudunensis (Of the Miracles of St Mary of Laon). Two short chapters describe the events that took place in "a town called Christikerca", though Hermann replaces Guibert de Nogent‚Äôs lightning with a five-headed dragon. Hermann‚Äôs account was reproduced in the [[Patrologia Latina]] (Vol 156, Col 979-982) published by [[Jacques-Paul Migne]] in the 19th century. 

In the early 13th century the story was retold in rhyming couplets by Prior [[Gautier de Coincy]], a French poet-composer. An illustrated manuscript of this work, Miracles de Notre-Dame et Autres Po√©sies de Gautier de Coinci, which features depictions of the dragon flying over the town and river (Folio 210v), is held in the [[Biblioth√®que nationale de France]].

In the early 14th century the story appeared in the Nikolaus Saga written by [[Bergr Sokkason]], an Icelandic monk and scholar. He probably had access to earlier Latin and Icelandic versions of the story. It was subsequently reproduced in other Icelandic sagas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nine Norse Studies |last=[[Gabriel Turville-Petre|Turville-Petre]]|first=Gabriel |year=1972|publisher= London: University College London, for the [[Viking Society for Northern Research]]|pages=64-78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some key details of Hermann de Tournai‚Äòs account are confirmed by the Christchurch Priory [[cartulary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Christchurch Priory Cartulary |last=Hanna |first=Katharine |year=2007 |publisher=Hampshire County Council |location= The Castle, Winchester, SO23 8UJ|isbn=1-85975-761-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bulk of which was compiled by 1372. It records that the Holy Trinity minster church was undergoing major reconstruction instigated in about 1094 by [[Ranulf Flambard]]. It also confirms that an annual fair was held a week after Pentecost on the feast day of the church, which only later became known as [[Trinity Sunday]]. It indicates that the dean in 1113 was the self-serving Peter de Oglander, who ‚Äúimbued with evil intent, took away for himself all things set aside by ancient custom for the work of the church‚Äù. However, the cartulary makes no mention of the church being badly damaged during construction.

==Modern era==

In 1933 [[John Strong Perry Tatlock]], a specialist on medieval literature at the University of California, examined Hermann de Tournai‚Äôs text and asserted that he could find nothing that contradicted the presumed date of 1113 for the canons‚Äô journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Speculum, Vol. 8, No. 4: The English Journey of the Laon Canons |last=Tatlock |first=J S P |year=1933 |publisher=The Medieval Academy of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 much of Hermann de Tournai‚Äôs account was translated by English folklorist Jeremy Harte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dragon of Christchurch and Other Wonders Seen on a Journey Through the West of England in 1113 |last=Harte|first=Jeremy |year=1985 |publisher=South-Western Antiquarian Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is thought to be the earliest translation of Hermann de Tournai‚Äôs text into English.

A more recent translation (in French) of Hermann de Tournai‚Äôs account appears in Les Miracles de Sainte Marie de Laon by Alain Saint-Denis (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Les Miracles de Sainte Marie de Laon |last= Saint-Denis |first= Alain |year=2008 |publisher=CNRS √âditions, Paris |pages=175-180 |isbn=978-2-271-06567-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint-Denis calculates the date of the dragon‚Äôs appearance to be Sunday 1st June 1113.

In May 2013 the 900th anniversary of the dragon‚Äôs appearance in Christchurch was commemorated by a locally organised Christchurch Dragon Festival with contributions by local schools, the Christchurch Chamber of Trade &amp; Commerce, Christchurch Library, and the Red House Museum. On 1 June 2013, the five-headed dragon was mentioned in Search for Christchurch, a poem especially written by performance poet [[Elvis McGonagall]] and read by him at the official reopening of the newly refurbished Christchurch Library and Learning Centre.

==Explanation==

There is no accepted explanation for the Christchurch Dragon. However, the references to an abnormally violent rainstorm accompanied by lightning bears a resemblance to the [[The Great Thunderstorm|Great Thunderstorm]] on Dartmoor in 1638. This has led to the speculation, supported by Christopher Chatfield, Deputy Director of the Ball Lightning Research Division of [[TORRO]] (Tornado &amp; Storm Research Organisation), that the canons of Laon may have witnessed a rare example of prolonged [[ball lightning]].

'''Color constancy''' is an example of [[subjective constancy]] and a feature of the human [[color perception]] system which ensures that the perceived color of objects remains relatively constant under varying illumination conditions. A green apple for instance looks green to us at midday, when the main illumination is white sunlight, and also at sunset, when the main illumination is red. This helps us identify objects.

==Color vision==
{{main|Color vision}}
[[Color vision]] is a process by which organisms and machines are able to distinguish objects based on the different wavelengths of light reflected, transmitted, or emitted by the object. In humans, light is detected by the eye using two types of photoreceptors, [[Cone cells|cones]] and [[Rod cells|rods]], which send signals to the [[visual cortex]], which in turn processes those sensations into a subjective perception of color. Color constancy is a process that allows the brain to recognize a familiar object as being a consistent color regardless of the amount or wavelengths of light reflecting from it at a given moment.&lt;ref name=krantz&gt;{{cite book |last=Krantz |first=John |title=Experiencing Sensation and Perception |year=2009 |publisher=Pearson Education, Limited |isbn=0-13-097793-4 |pages=9.9‚Äì9.10 |url=http://www.saylor.org/content/krantz_sensation/Experiencing_Sensation_and_Perception.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wendycarlos.com/colorvis/color.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Object Illuminance ==
The phenomenon of color constancy occurs when the source of illumination is not directly known.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foster | first1 = David H. | year = 2011| title = Color Constancy | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 51 | issue = 7| pages = 674‚Äì700 | doi = 10.1016/j.visres.2010.09.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that color constancy takes a greater effect on days with sun and clear sky as opposed to days that are overcast.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Even when the sun is visible, color constancy may affect [[Color vision|color perception.]] This is due to an ignorance of all possible sources of illumination.  Although an object may reflect multiple sources of light into the eye, color constancy causes objective identities to remain constant.&lt;ref name="Jameson 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jameson | first1 = D. | last2 = Hurvich | first2 = L. M. | year = 1989 | title = Essay concerning color constancy | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 1‚Äì22 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.40.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D. H. Foster (2011) states, "in the natural environment, the source itself may not be well defined in that the illumination at a particular point in a scene is usually a complex mixture of direct and indirect [light] distributed over a range of incident angles, in turn modified by local occlusion and mutual reflection, all of which may vary with time and position."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The wide spectrum of possible illuminances in the natural environment and the limited ability of the human eye to perceive color means that color constancy plays a functional role in daily perception.  Color constancy allows for humans to interact with the world in a consistent or veridical manner&lt;ref&gt;Zeki, S. (1993). ''A vision of the brain''. Oxford: Blackwell Science Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; and it allows for one to more effectively make judgements on the time of day.&lt;ref name="Jameson 1989" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reeves | first1 = A | year = 1992 | title = Areas of ignorance and confusion in color science | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 49‚Äì50 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00067510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological basis==
The physiological basis for color constancy is thought to involve specialized [[neurons]] in the [[primary visual cortex]] that compute local ratios of cone activity, which is the same calculation that Land's retinex algorithm uses to achieve color constancy. These specialized cells are called ''double-opponent cells'' because they compute both color opponency and spatial opponency. Double-opponent cells were first described by [[Nigel Daw]] in the [[goldfish]] retina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.158.3803.942 |title=Goldfish Retina: Organization for Simultaneous Colour Contrast |first=Nigel W. |last=Daw   |journal=Science |date=17 November 1967 |volume=158 |issue=3803 |pages=942‚Äì4 |pmid=6054169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Neural Mechanisms of Color Vision: Double-Opponent Cells in the Visual Cortex |author=Bevil R. Conway |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFodUlHfQmcC&amp;pg=PR7 |publisher=Springer |year=2002 |isbn=1-4020-7092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was considerable debate about the existence of these cells in the primate visual system; their existence was eventually proven using reverse-correlation [[receptive field]] mapping and special stimuli that selectively activate single cone classes at a time, so-called "cone-isolating" stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conway | first1 = BR | last2 = Livingstone | first2 = MS | year = 2006 | title = Spatial and Temporal Properties of Cone Signals in Alert Macaque Primary Visual Cortex (V1) | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 26 | issue = 42| pages = 10826‚Äì46 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.2091-06.2006| pmc = 2963176 }} [cover illustration].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conway | first1 = BR | year = 2001 | title = Spatial structure of cone inputs to color cells in alert macaque primary visual cortex (V-1) | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 21 | issue = 8| pages = 2768‚Äì2783 }} [cover illustration].&lt;/ref&gt;

Color constancy works only if the incident illumination contains a range of wavelengths. The different [[cone cell]]s of the [[Human eye|eye]] register different but overlapping ranges of wavelengths of the light reflected by every object in the scene. From this information, the visual system attempts to determine the approximate composition of the illuminating light. This illumination is then ''discounted''&lt;ref&gt;"Discounting the illuminant" is a term introduced by [[Helmholtz]]: {{cite conference |title=Do humans discount the illuminant? |booktitle=Proceedings of [[SPIE]] |volume=5666 |conference=Human Vision and Electronic Imaging X |first=John J. |last=McCann |editor1=Bernice E. Rogowitz |editor2=Thrasyvoulos N. Pappas |editor3=Scott J. Daly |date=March 2005 |pages=9‚Äì16 |doi=10.1117/12.594383}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to obtain the object's "true color" or [[reflectance]]: the wavelengths of light the object reflects. This reflectance then largely determines the perceived color.

=== Neural Mechanism ===
There are two possible mechanisms for color constancy.   The first mechanism is unconscious inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Judd | first1 = D. B. | year = 1940 | title = Hue saturation and lightness of surface colors with chromatic illumination | url = | journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 2‚Äì32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second view holds this phenomenon to be caused by sensory adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Helson | first1 = H | year = 1943 | title = Some factors and implications of color constancy | url = | journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 555‚Äì567 | doi=10.1364/josa.33.000555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hering, E. (1920). Grundz√ºge der Lehre vom Lichtsinn. Berlin: Springer (Trans. Hurvich, L. M. &amp; Jameson, D., 1964, Outlines of a theory of the light sense, Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;   Research suggests color constancy to be related changes in [[retina]]l cells as well as cortical areas related to vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeki | first1 = S | year = 1980 | title = The representation of colours in the cerebral cortex | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 284 | issue = | pages = 412‚Äì418 | doi=10.1038/284412a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeki | first1 = S | year = 1983 | title = Colour coding in the cerebral cortex: The reaction of cells in monkey visual cortex to wavelengths and colours | url = | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 741‚Äì765 | doi=10.1016/0306-4522(83)90265-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hood|first=D.C.|date=1998|title=Lower-Level Visual Processing and Models of Light Adaptation|url=|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=49|pages=503‚Äì535|via=Annual Reviews|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.503}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is most likely attributed to changes in various levels of the visual system.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==== Cone Adaptation ====
Cones, specialized cells within the retina, will adjust relative to light levels within the local environment.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This occurs at the level of individual neurons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = B. B. | last2 = Dacey | first2 = D. M. | last3 = Smith | first3 = V. C. | last4 = Pokorny | first4 = J. | year = 1999 | title = Horizontal cells reveal cone type-specific adaptation in primate retina | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 14611‚Äì14616 | doi=10.1073/pnas.96.25.14611| pmc = 24484 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this adaptation is incomplete.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Chromatic adaptation]] is also regulated by processes within the brain.  Research in monkeys suggest that changes in chromatic sensitivity is correlated to activity in [[Parvocellular cell|parvocellular]] [[Lateral geniculate nucleus|lateral geniculate]] neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Creutzfeldt | first1 = O.

Adaptation and surround effects | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 22‚Äì45 | doi=10.1007/bf00228504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color constancy may be both attributed to localized changes in individual retinal cells or to higher level neural processes within the brain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Metamerism ==
Metamerism, the perceiving of colors within two separate scenes, can help to inform research regarding color constancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kalderon |first=Mark Eli |title=Metamerism, Constancy, and Knowing Which |journal=Mind |volume=117 |issue=468 |year=2008 |pages=935‚Äì971 |jstor=20532701 |doi=10.1093/mind/fzn043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupte|first=Vilas|date=2009-12-01|title=Color Constancy, by Marc Ebner (Wiley; 2007) pp 394 ISBN 978-0-470-05829-9 (HB)|journal=Coloration Technology|language=en|volume=125|issue=6|pages=366‚Äì367|doi=10.1111/j.1478-4408.2009.00219.x|issn=1478-4408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that when competing chromatic stimuli are presented, spatial comparisons must be completed early in the visual system.   For example, when subjects are presented stimuli in a [[Dichoptic presentation|dichoptic]] fashion, an array of colors and a void color, such as grey, and are told to focus on a specific color of the array, the void color appears different than when perceived in a binocular fashion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moutoussis | first1 = K. | last2 = Zeki | first2 = S. | year = 2000 | title = A psychophysical dissection of the brain sites involved in color-generating comparisons | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = | pages = 8069‚Äì8074 | doi=10.1073/pnas.110570897| pmc = 16671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that color judgements, as they relate to spatial comparisons, must be completed at or prior to the [[Visual cortex|V1]] monocular neurons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hurlbert | first1 = A. C. | last2 = Bramwell | first2 = D. I. | last3 = Heywood | first3 = C. | last4 = Cowey | first4 = A. | year = 1998 | title = Discrimination of cone contrast changes as evidence for colour constancy in cerebral achromatopsia | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 123 | issue = | pages = 136‚Äì144 | doi=10.1007/s002210050554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kentridge | first1 = R.

==Retinex theory==
The "Land effect" refers to the capacity to see full color (if muted) images solely by looking at a photo with red and gray wavelengths. The effect was discovered by [[Edwin H. Land]], who was attempting to reconstruct [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s early experiments in full-colored images. Land realized that, even when there were no green or blue wavelengths present in an image, the visual system would still perceive them as green or blue by discounting the red illumination. Land described this effect in a 1959 article in ''[[Scientific American]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psy.vanderbilt.edu/courses/psy236/ColorVision/Land1959.pdf|title=Experiments in Color Vision|last=Land|first=Edwin|date=May 1959|website=Scientific American|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Land wrote another ''[[Scientific American]]'' article that formulated his "retinex theory" to explain the Land effect. The word "retinex" is a [[portmanteau]] formed from "[[retina]]" and "[[Cerebral cortex|cortex]]", suggesting that both the eye and the brain are involved in the processing. Land, with John McCann, also developed a computer program designed to imitate the retinex processes taking place in human physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://perceptionstuff.weebly.com/uploads/2/8/4/7/2847832/land-retinex_theory.pdf|title=The Retinex Theory of Color Vision|last=Land|first=Edwin|date=December 1977|website=Scientific American|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect can be experimentally demonstrated as follows. A display called a "Mondrian" (after [[Piet Mondrian]] whose paintings are similar) consisting of numerous colored patches is shown to a person. The display is illuminated by three white lights, one projected through a red filter, one projected through a green filter, and one projected through a blue filter. The person is asked to adjust the intensity of the lights so that a particular patch in the display appears white. The experimenter then measures the intensities of red, green, and blue light reflected from this white-appearing patch. Then the experimenter asks the person to identify the color of a neighboring patch, which, for example, appears green. Then the experimenter adjusts the lights so that the intensities of red, blue, and green light reflected from the green patch are the same as were originally measured from the white patch. The person shows color constancy in that the green patch continues to appear green, the white patch continues to appear white, and all the remaining patches continue to have their original colors.

Color constancy is a desirable feature of [[computer vision]], and many algorithms have been developed for this purpose. These include several retinex algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1117/12.805474 | title=Fast implementation of color constancy algorithms | year=2009 | journal=Color Imaging XIV: Displaying, Processing, Hardcopy, and Applications | last1 = Morel | first1 = Jean-Michel | last2 = Petro | first2 = Ana B. | last3 = Sbert | first3 = Catalina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=R. |last1=Kimmel |first2=M. |last2=Elad |first3=D. |last3=Shaked |first4=R. |last4=Keshet |first5=I. |last5=Sobel |url=http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ron/PAPERS/retinex_ijcv2003.pdf |title=A Variational Framework for Retinex |journal=International Journal of Computer Vision |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=7‚Äì23 |year=2003 |doi=10.1023/A:1022314423998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barghout, Lauren, and Lawrence Lee.

"Visual Taxometric Approach to Image Segmentation Using Fuzzy-Spatial Taxon Cut Yields Contextually Relevant Regions." Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems. Springer International Publishing, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; These algorithms receive as input the red/green/blue values of each [[pixel]] of the image and attempt to estimate the reflectances of each point. One such algorithm operates as follows: the maximal red value ''r''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of all pixels is determined, and also the maximal green value ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''max''&lt;/sub&gt; and the maximal blue value ''b''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;. Assuming that the scene contains objects which reflect all red light, and (other) objects which reflect all green light and still others which reflect all blue light, one can then deduce that the illuminating light source is described by (''r''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;). For each pixel with values (''r'', ''g'', ''b'') its reflectance is estimated as (''r''/''r''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''/''g''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''/''b''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;). The original retinex algorithm proposed by Land and McCann uses a localized version of this principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Provenzi | first1 = Edoardo | last2 = De Carli | first2 = Luca | last3 = Rizzi | first3 = Alessandro | last4 = Marini | first4 = Daniele | year = 2005 | title = Mathematical definition and analysis of the Retinex algorithm | url = | journal = JOSA A | volume = 22 | issue = 12| pages = 2613‚Äì2621 | doi=10.1364/josaa.22.002613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bertalm√≠o | first1 = Marcelo | last2 = Caselles | first2 = Vicent | last3 = Provenzi | first3 = Edoardo | year = 2009 | title = Issues About Retinex Theory and Contrast Enhancement | url = | journal = IJCV | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 101‚Äì119 | doi=10.1007/s11263-009-0221-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Time for Experimentation (38896311835).jpg|thumb|A photograph color graded into orange and teal]]
'''Color grading''' is the process of improving the appearance of an image for presentation in different environments on different devices. Various attributes of an image such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point may be enhanced whether for motion pictures, videos, or still images. Color grading and color correction are often used synonymously as terms for this process and can include the generation of artistic color effects through creative blending and composting of different images.  Color grading is generally now performed in a digital process either in a controlled environment such as a [[color suite]], or in any location where a computer can be used in dim lighting.  

The earlier [[film processing|photo-chemical film process]], now referred to as '''color timing''', was performed at a [[photographic laboratory]] by the use of filters and exposure changes while copying from one film to another.

== Color timing ==
Color timing is used in reproducing film elements.  "Color grading" was originally a lab term for the process of changing color appearance in film reproduction when going to the [[answer print]] or release print in the film reproduction chain. By the late 2010s, this film grading technique had become known as ''color timing'' and still involved changing the duration of exposure through different filters during the film development process.  Color timing is specified in [[printer point]]s which represent presets in a lab contact printer where 7-12 printer points represent one stop of light. The number of points per stop varied based upon negative or print stock and different presets at Film Labs.  

In a film production, the creative team would meet with the ‚ÄúLab Timer‚Äù who would watch a running film and make notes dependent upon the team's directions.  After the session, the Timer would return to the Lab, and put the film negative on a device (the Hazeltine) which had preview filters with a controlled backlight, and pick exact settings of each printer point for each scene.  These settings were then punched onto a paper tape and fed to the high-speed printer where the negative was exposed through a backlight to a print stock.  Filter settings were changed on the fly to match the printer lights that were on the paper tape.    For complex work such as visual effects shots, "[[step wedge|wedge]]s‚Äù running through combinations of filters were sometimes processed to aid the choice of the correct grading.

This process is used wherever Film materials are being reproduced.

== Telecine ==
{{Main|Telecine}}
With the advent of television, broadcasters quickly realised the limitations of [[live television]] broadcasts and they turned to broadcasting feature films from release prints directly from a [[telecine]]. This was before 1956 when [[Ampex]] introduced the first [[Quadruplex videotape]] recorder (VTR) VRX-1000. Live television shows could also be recorded to film and aired at different times in different time zones by filming a video monitor. The heart of this system was the ''[[kinescope]]'', a device for recording a television broadcast to film.&lt;ref name="filmintovideo"&gt;Kallenberger, Richard H., Cvjetnicanin, George D. (1994). ''Film into Video: A Guide to Merging the Technologies''. Focal Press. {{ISBN|0-240-80215-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early telecine hardware was the "[[film chain]]" for broadcasting from film and utilized a film projector connected to a video camera. As explained by [[Jay Holben]] in ''American Cinematographer Magazine'', "The telecine didn't truly become a viable [[post-production]] tool until it was given the ability to perform colour correction on a video signal."&lt;ref name="filmtotape"&gt;Holben, Jay (May 1999). "From Film to Tape" ''American Cinematographer Magazine'', pp. 108‚Äì122.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How telecine coloring works ===
In a [[Cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) system, an electron beam is projected at a phosphor-coated envelope, producing a spot of light the size of a single pixel. This beam is then scanned across a film frame from left to right, capturing the "vertical" frame information. Horizontal scanning of the frame is then accomplished as the film moves past the CRT's beam. Once this photon beam passes through the film frame, it encounters a series of [[dichroic mirror]]s which separate the image into its primary red, green and blue components. From there, each individual beam is reflected onto a [[Photomultiplier|photomultiplier tube]] (PMT) where the photons are converted into an electronic signal to be recorded to tape.

In a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) [[Telecine#CCD|telecine]], a white light is shone through the exposed film image onto a [[prism]], which separates the image into the three primary colors, red, green and blue. Each beam of colored light is then projected at a different CCD, one for each color. The CCD converts the light into an electronic signal, and the telecine electronics modulate these into a video signal that can then be color graded.

Early color correction on Rank Cintel MkIII CRT [[telecine]] systems was accomplished by varying the primary gain voltages on each of the three photomultiplier tubes to vary the output of red, green and blue. Further advancements converted much of the color-processing equipment from analog to digital and then, with the next-generation telecine, the Ursa, the coloring process was completely digital in the 4:2:2 [[color space]]. The Ursa Gold brought about color grading in the full 4:4:4 color space.&lt;ref name="filmtotape"&gt;Holben, Jay (May 1999). "From Film to Tape" ''American Cinematographer Magazine'', pp. 108‚Äì122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Color correction control systems started with the Rank Cintel TOPSY (Telecine Operations Programming SYstem) in 1978.&lt;ref name="filmintovideo" /&gt; In 1984 [[Da Vinci Systems]] introduced their first color corrector, a computer-controlled interface that would manipulate the color voltages on the Rank Cintel MkIII systems. Since then, technology has improved to give extraordinary power to the digital colorist. Today there are many companies making color correction control interfaces including [[Da Vinci Systems]], [[Pandora International]], [[Pandora International#Pogle color corrector|Pogle]] and [[Telecine#Controllers|more]].

Some telecines are still in operation in 2018.

== Color Correction ==
Some of the main artistic functions of color correction (digital color grading):&lt;ref name="filmintovideo" /&gt;

*Reproduce accurately what was shot
*Compensate for variations in the material (i.e., film errors, white balance, varying lighting conditions)
*Compensate for the intended viewing environment (dark, dim, bright surrounds)
*Optimize base appearance for inclusion of special visual effects
*Establish a desired artistic 'look'
*Enhance and/or alter the mood of a scene ‚Äî the visual equivalent to the musical accompaniment of a film; compare also [[film tinting]]

Note that some of these functions must be prioritized over others; for example, color grading may be done to ensure that the recorded colors match those of the original scene, whereas other times, the goal may instead be to establish a very artificial stylized look.

Traditionally, color grading was done towards practical goals. For example, in the film [[Marianne (2011 film)|Marianne]], grading was used so that night scenes could be filmed more cheaply in daylight.  Secondary color correction was originally used to establish color continuity, however the trend today is increasingly moving towards creative goals, such as improving the aesthetics of an image, establishing stylized looks, and setting the mood of a scene through color.  Due to this trend, some colorists suggest the phrase "color enhancement" over "color correction".

==== Primary and secondary color grading ====
Primary color grading affects the whole image by providing control over the [[Sensitometry|color density curve]]s of red, green, blue color channels, across the entire frame. Secondary correction can isolate a range of hue, saturation and brightness values to bring about alterations in hue, saturation and luminance only in that range, allowing the grading of [[secondary color]]s, while having a minimal or usually no effect on the remainder of the color spectrum.&lt;ref name="filmintovideo" /&gt; Using [[Digital data|digital]] grading, objects and color ranges within a scene can be isolated with precision and adjusted. Color tints can be manipulated and visual treatments pushed to extremes not physically possible with laboratory processing.  With these advancements, the color correction process has become increasingly similar to well-established digital painting techniques, ushering forth a new era of [[digital cinematography]].

==== Masks, mattes, power windows ====
The evolution of digital color grading tools has advanced to the point where the colorist can use geometric shapes (such as mattes or masks in photo software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]) to isolate color adjustments to specific areas of an image. These tools can highlight a wall in the background and color only that wall, leaving the rest of the frame alone, or color everything but that wall. Subsequent color correctors (typically software-based) have the ability to use spline-based shapes for even greater control over isolating color adjustments. Color keying is also used for isolating areas to adjust.

Inside and outside of area-based isolations, digital filtration can be applied to soften, sharpen or mimic the effects of traditional glass photographic filters in nearly infinite degrees.

==== Motion tracking ====
When trying to isolate a color adjustment on a moving subject, the colorist traditionally would have needed to manually move a mask to follow the subject.  In its most simple form, motion tracking software automates this time-consuming process using algorithms to evaluate the motion of a group of pixels.  These techniques are generally derived from [[match moving]] techniques used in special effects and compositing work.

== Digital intermediate ==
{{Main|Digital intermediate}}
The evolution of the [[telecine]] device into [[Motion picture film scanner|film scanning]] allowed the digital information scanned from a film negative to be of sufficient resolution to transfer back to film.  In the early 90‚Äôs, Kodak developed the Cineon Film System to capture, manipulate, and record back to film and they called this the ‚ÄúDigital Intermediate‚Äù.  This term stuck.  The first Digital Intermediate of any form was the Cinesite restoration of ‚ÄúSnow White and The Seven Dwarves‚Äù in 1993.   [Previously in 1990 for "Rescuers Down Under", the Disney CAPS system had been used to scan artwork, color and composite it, and then record it to film,  but this was also intermixed with a traditional lab development process over a length of time]

In the late 1990s, the films ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]'' and ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' advanced the technology to the point that the creation of a [[digital intermediate]] was practical, which greatly expanded the capabilities of the digital telecine colorist in a traditionally film-oriented world. After 2010, almost all feature films go through the DI process, while manipulation through photochemical processing is rare or used on archival films.

In Hollywood, ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' was the first film to be wholly digitally graded. The negative was scanned with a [[Spirit DataCine]] at [[Digital cinema|2K]] resolution, then colors were digitally fine-tuned using a Pandora MegaDef color corrector on a [[Virtual telecine#2k virtual DataCine products|Virtual DataCine]]. The process took several weeks, and the resulting [[digital master]] was output to film again with a Kodak laser [[Film-out|recorder]] to create a master [[internegative]].

Modern motion picture processing typically uses both digital cameras and digital projectors and calibrated devices are essential to predict whether the appropriate colors are appearing.

=== Hardware-based versus software-based systems ===
[[File:Colour grading with Scratch (18000309972).jpg|thumb|Color grading with Scratch]]
In early use, hardware-based systems (da Vinci 2K, [[Pandora International]] MegaDEF, etc.) have historically offered better performance but a smaller feature set than software-based systems. Their real time performance was optimised to particular resolution and bit depths, as opposed to software platforms using standard computer industry hardware that often trade speed for resolution independence, e.g. [[Color (software)|Apple's Color]] (previously Silicon Color Final Touch), [[ASSIMILATE SCRATCH]], [[Adobe SpeedGrade]] and [[SGO Mistika]].  While hardware-based systems always offer real-time performance, some software-based systems need to pre-render as the complexity of the color grading increases.  On the other hand, software-based systems tend to have more features such as spline-based windows/masks and advanced motion tracking.

The line between hardware and software no longer exists as many software-based color correctors (e.g. [[Pablo]] , [[Mistika]], [[SCRATCH]], [[Autodesk Lustre]], [[Nucoda Film Master]] and [[Filmlight Baselight]]) use multi processor workstations and a [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] (graphics processing unit) as a means of [[hardware acceleration]].  As well, some newer software-based systems use a cluster of multiple parallel GPUs on the one computer system to improve performance at the very high resolutions required for feature film grading. e.g. Blackmagic Designs' DaVinci Resolve. Some color grading software like Synthetic Aperture's Color Finesse runs solely as software and will even run on low-end computer systems.  High-speed RAID arrays are an essential part of the process for all systems.

=== Hardware ===
{{Redirect|Pogle}}
Hardware systems are no longer common because of the excellent price/performance of software systems.   The control panels are placed in a [[color suite]] for the colorist to operate the telecine remotely.

*Many{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} telecines were controlled by a [[Da Vinci Systems]] color corrector 2k or 2k Plus. 
*Other hardware systems are controlled by Pandora Int.'s Pogle, often with either a MegaDEF, Pixi, or Revolution color grading system.
*For some real-time systems used in ‚Äòlinear‚Äô editing, color grading systems required an edit controller. The edit controller controls the telecine and a [[VTR]](s) or other recording/playback devices to ensure frame accurate film frame [[Non-linear editing system|editing]]. There are a number of systems which can be used for edit control. Some color grading products such as Pandora Int.'s Pogle have a built-in edit controller. Otherwise, a separate device such as [[Da Vinci Systems]]' TLC edit controller would be used.
*Older systems are: Renaissance, Classic analog, [[Da Vinci Systems]]'s: The Whiz (1982) and 888; The Corporate Communications's System 60XL (1982‚Äì1989) and Copernicus-Sunburst; Bosch [[Fernseh]]'s FRP-60 (1983‚Äì1989); Dubner (1978‚Äì1985?), [[Cintel]]'s TOPSY (1978), Amigo (1983), and ARCAS (1992) systems. All of these older systems work only with [[standard-definition]] [[480i|525]] and [[576i|625]] video signals, and are considered near obsolete today.

Entry on the website of the LACMA] retrieved 11 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; later on they began to treat the vessel as a sculptural form, an advance facilitated by developments in ceramic technology that allowed them construct vessels with thinner walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/04/sac/ho_63.232.55.htm "Gourd bottle &amp;#91;Peru; Topar√°&amp;#93; (63.232.55)".] In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì. (October 2006) Retrieved 11 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition was continued by the Nazca, whose vessels were elaborately figurative (see illustration below right), decorated with polychrome glazes, or both. 
 
The vessels were constructed by the [[coiling (pottery)|coil method]]. The Nazca would then apply multicolored [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] to achieve polychrome effects before the vessels were fired, an advance over the Paracas, who had painted the vessels with resins after firing. The Nazca technique allowed for much brighter and more permanent colors, whose sheen was enhanced by burnishing after the vessel was fired.&lt;ref name = "Brit"&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/d/double_spout_and_bridge_vessel.aspx ''Double spout and bridge vessel with hummingbirds''], on the Website of the British Museum. Retrieved 11 May 2009. Slip firing fuses the pigmented minerals with the clay itself, while resin simply sat on the surface, and as an organic material was subject to decay&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Paracas and the Nazca appear to have used this type of vessel for ritual purposes, as they are most often found in graves.&lt;ref name = "Brit" /&gt;

The '''East Tennessee Community Design Center''', founded in 1970, is an organization who offers design and planning assistance to communities and organizations throughout 16 counties of [[East Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://knoxvilleisurf.com/local-news-knoxville/780.html |title=East Tennessee Community Design Center receives grant &amp;#124; Knoxville, TN - Local, Free, Knoxville News |publisher=Knoxvilleisurf.com |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2012-11-18 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127122914/http://knoxvilleisurf.com/local-news-knoxville/780.html |archivedate=2013-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Community Design Center offers its services through the pro bono contributions of area architects, landscape architects, planners and other professionals. It is located in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] and is registered as a nonprofit corporation chartered as a [[501(c)(3)]] tax-exempt organization under [[IRS]] regulations.

== History ==
The Community Design Center has been in existence since 1969, when [[Bruce McCarty]], then the President of the local chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA), visited the community design center in Philadelphia. Bruce returned to "pitch the idea" to some 40 local professionals that Knoxville too was in need of a community design center. McCarty founded the ETCDC to offer technical expertise to non-profit organizations.  Dozens of professional architects and students from the University of Tennessee donate their time and talent in order to assist charitable groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=124509 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209025501/http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=124509 |archive-date=2013-02-09 |title=East Tennessee Community Design Center celebrates 40 years |publisher=wbir.com |date=2010-06-17 |accessdate=2012-11-18|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning, the Community Design Center was a part of a national movement instigated by the [[American Institute of Architects]] and the [[National Urban League]]. [[Bruce McCarty]] was the local instigator. Bruce heard that architects, planners, and other designers in other cities were helping change communities by donating their professional services to low-income communities and groups. Bruce took his son, Doug, and other architecture students to see how it was being done in Philadelphia, location of one of the first Community Design Centers. Back home in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], Bruce led a local coalition of planners, community organizers, social workers, architects, and landscape architects in formation of the East Tennessee Community Design Center. On July 1, 1970 the center was incorporated for one purpose, to bring professional design and planning services to non-profit groups and agencies that lack the resources to pay for the service. By 1971, there were at least 83 such programs across the country.

The first project of the Community Design Center was a neighborhood plan for [[Fort Sanders (Knoxville neighborhood)|Fort Sanders]], funded through the East Tennessee Development District, using a Housing and Urban Development grant intended to assist grassroots planning. Members of the first Board of Directors, with their own hands, rehabilitated the Design Center's historic home in Knoxville. These early board members also organized a process for accepting and assisting new projects, provided planning and design assistance to the Fort Sanders study, and recruited their colleagues to help with the additional project requests that began to pour in.

== Mission ==
The mission statement given by the East Tennessee Community Design Center is "to make East Tennessee a better place to live and work by bringing professional design and planning assistance to community groups and non-profit organizations."&lt;ref name="East Tennessee Community Design Center"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communitydc.org/about/ |title=Community Design Center &amp;#124; East Tennessee Community Design Center &amp;#124; Architecture &amp;#124; Landscaping &amp;#124; Planning &amp;#124; Community Development &amp;#124; Nonprofit &amp;#124; ETCDC &amp;#124; Design &amp;#124; Knoxville - About &amp;#124; Community Design Center |publisher=Communitydc.org |accessdate=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Executive Directors ==
* Wayne Blasius (2015-current)
* Mary Linda Schwarzbart (2013-2015)
* John C. Merino (2013-2013)
* David Watson (2002‚Äì2013)
* Tim Ledford (1996‚Äì2001)
* Terry Shupp (1995‚Äì1996)
* Annette Anderson (1973‚Äì1995)
* Bill Oliphant (1971‚Äì1973)
* Ed Dusek (1970‚Äì1971)
&lt;br&gt;
The first Coordinator of the Community Design Center was Ed Dusek, an architect from [[Nashville, Tennessee]], who led the Center through the completion of the Fort Sanders plan. His successor was landscape architect Bill Oliphant, one of the Center's founders.  Oliphant brought the first VISTA's to the Center in 1972. Those "Knoxville Nine" were the first of many VISTA's who served East Tennessee and their own career development by their work on Community Design Center projects. The Community Design Center hosted the longest lasting [[Americorps VISTA]] program in the country. Annette Anderson began her 22 year tenure as the Coordinator of the Center in 1973 and remained the director until 1995.

=== Staff ===
The center has an all-volunteer board of directors and a small staff of two full-time personnel, the Executive Director and the Assistant to the Director. Part-time staff includes an administrative assistant, a Studio Director and a DesignWorks Program coordinator, along with a variable number of paid students primarily from [[The University of Tennessee]] College of Architecture and Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metropulse.com/news/2010/nov/03/east-tennessee-community-design-center-marks-40-ye/ |title=East Tennessee Community Design Center Marks 40 years |publisher=Metro Pulse |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2012-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110060006/http://www.metropulse.com/news/2010/nov/03/east-tennessee-community-design-center-marks-40-ye/ |archivedate=November 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==
The majority of assistance provided by the East Tennessee Community Design Center is architectural and engineering services to nonprofit groups whose projects serve the community at large. Early design support leads to complete projects. The main types of projects that the staff works are community facilities, long range visioning and planning, landscaping, parks and playgrounds, as well as rehabilitation and reuse.

Some of the services provided are:
* Introducing the client to Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)
* Introducing the client to sustainable design
* Anticipating project implementation costs
* Evaluating existing building conditions
* Identifying health, safety, and accessibility issues
* Establishing project implementation priorities
* Understanding space needs of the client and transforming those needs into a building design
* Exploring design options
* Containing project costs through design alternatives
* Graphically illustrate how the project will look when construction or renovation is complete &lt;ref name="East Tennessee Community Design Center"/&gt;

== Funding ==
Funding to sustain the operations is solely from competitive grants and donations from corporate sponsors and individuals in the community. The East Tennessee Community Design Center does request a donation from their clients as well, which is used to help offset the cost associated with providing the design assistance. Funding for preliminary design services is hard to find. The Design Center fills this gap by providing conceptual only architectural and engineering services to community groups and nonprofit organizations early in the project development process.&lt;ref name="East Tennessee Community Design Center"/&gt;

[[File:Dryandra sessilis (Edgar Dell).jpg|thumb|right|An example of Dell's art: ''Dryandra sessilis'' (now ''[[Banksia sessilis]]''), first published in 1935.]]

'''Edgar Dell''' (28 November 1901 ‚Äì 18 April 2008) was a [[Western Australia]]n painter best known for his watercolour paintings of that state's wildflowers.

Born in England in 1901, he emigrated to Western Australia in 1924, where he bought and cleared a bush block in [[Paulls Valley]] in the Shire of [[Kalamunda]], establishing an [[orchard]] there. The block came to be known as The Dell; this name has subsequently also been extended to a nearby recreation site. During the [[Great Depression]] he made a living cutting timber in the bush, and also painted wildflowers for [[West Australian Newspapers]] Ltd., which published one painting a week in a colour supplement to ''[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|The Western Mail]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1936) ''Flowers of Western Australia.'' Perth [W.A.] (The plates were issued as weekly supplements of the Western Mail during the period 1933‚Äì1935) and are from original watercolours by Edgar Dell).&lt;/ref&gt; These were accompanied by a botanical description by [[Charles Gardner]], then Government Botanist, and were so popular that they were compiled into book form and published under the title ''Western Australian Wildflowers'' in 1935. A revised and enlarged edition was published in 1958, and again in the 1970s under the title ''Wildflowers of Western Australia''. This ran to numerous editions, albeit with ever-diminishing numbers of Dell's plates.

Little is known of Dell's later life, but as late as 1973 he was still living on the Paulls Valley block that he cleared in the 1930s. He died in 2008, at the age of 106.

'''Electrogustometry''' is the measurement of [[taste]] threshold by passing controlled anodal current through the tongue. When current passes through the tongue a unique and distinct [[Parageusia|metallic taste]] is perceived.

Electrogustometry has been in existence since the 1950s. However, not much research has been done in this field.

==Equipment==

TR Bull developed an electrogustometer, but it lacked precision and was not widely accepted. In the 1990s the Rion (TR-06) was developed. This was precise and is widely used in the market. The TR-06 is probably the only electrogustometer used now for research and diagnosis. This is manual and needs a trained doctor or nurse to use it. It needs to be manually calculated to arrive at the taste threshold and carry out the false positive tests.

Small, light and portable, this hand-held, battery-powered device can be easily placed in any environment. It has an inbuilt false positive detect test. This is developed to cater for the [[Psychophysics|psychophysical analysis]] of the subject.

==Influencing factors==
Electrogustometric taste threshold depends on pulse duration pulse and area of contact of electrode and tongue. Detailed experiments will be performed to prove and discuss their influence on taste threshold with the automatic electrogustometer. Experiments have been performed with the manual TR-06 on to study the effects of these control factors.

==Philosophy==
The measure of the minimum amount of current required to excite the sensation of this taste is called the 'taste threshold'. This project involves the design and fabrication of an automatic instrument to measure this taste threshold.

'''Elizabeth Margaret Farrelly''' is a Sydney-based author, architecture critic, essayist, columnist and speaker who was born in [[New Zealand]] but later became an Australian citizen. She has contributed to
current debates about [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], design, [[public art]], architecture, [[urban areas|urban]] environments, society and politics, including criticism of the treatment of [[Julian Assange]].&lt;ref name="Farrelly SMH bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/by/elizabeth-farrelly | title=Elizabeth Farrelly | accessdate=11 January 2011 | work=Newspaper contributor biography | publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In the case of Assange, truth is actively and repeatedly punished". {{cite news|last=Farrelly|first=Elizabeth|title=Truth of Assange is stranger than fiction|date=12 April 2012|url=http://www.nationaltimes.com.au/opinion/politics/truth-of-assange-is-stranger-than-fiction-20120411-1ws4o.html|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=The National Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Assange had not been charged with any crime." {{cite news|last=Farrelly|first=Elizabeth|title=Ambassador's rage doesn't dispel facts|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/ambassadors-rage-doesnt-dispel-facts-20121128-2ae99.html||date=29 November 2012|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrelly has set writing for Wikipedia as a task for post-graduate students, and has commented that its demand for every input to be traceable and published, enables "genuine crowd-sourcing of scholarship" and is both "a revelation and a revolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/comment/why-wikipedia-at-15-is-a-beautiful-exercise-in-scholarly-excellence-20151209-glj79f.html|title = Don't fall for Wiki-denial: there's nothing wrong with using Wikipedia|last = Farrelly|first = Elizabeth|date = 9 December 2015|work = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = 10 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Farrelly practised as an architect in London until 1988, working at Pollard Thomas and Edwards Architects, London; at JASMaD Architects, [[Auckland]]; and Warren and Mahoney, [[Christchurch]]. She was the inaugural chair of the [[Australia Award for Urban Design]], an award "established to recognise recent urban design projects of high quality in Australia and to encourage cities, towns and emerging settlements of all sizes to strive similarly for improvement".&lt;ref name="Australia Award for Urban Design"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.planning.org.au/whatson/australia-award-for-urban-design | title=Australia Award for Urban Design | accessdate=11 January 2011 | author=Planning Institute Australia | work=website | publisher=Planning Institute Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a juror for design awards such as Parramatta Design Excellence Awards and the [[Royal Australian Institute of Architects Gold Medal|Royal Australian Institute of Architects Awards]].

==Public service==
Elizabeth Farrelly served as an independent Councillor of the [[City of Sydney]] from 1991 to 1995.

'''Fair Isle''' (/f…õ…ôra…™ÃØl/) is a traditional [[knitting]] technique used to create patterns with multiple colours.  It is named after [[Fair Isle]], one of the [[Shetland Islands|Shetland]] islands. Fair Isle knitting gained a considerable popularity when the Prince of Wales (later [[Edward VIII]]) wore Fair Isle jumpers in public in 1921. Traditional Fair Isle patterns have a limited palette of five or so colours, use only two colours per row, are worked in the round, and limit the length of a run of any particular colour.&lt;ref name="McGregorTraditional"&gt;{{cite book |last=McGregor|first=Sheila|authorlink=Sheila McGregor |date=1981 |title=The Complete Book of Traditional Fair Isle Knitting |location=London |publisher=Batsford |isbn=978-0-7134-1432-5 |oclc=8064374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people use the term "Fair Isle" to refer to any colourwork knitting where stitches are knitted alternately in various colours, with the unused colours stranded across the back of the work. Others use the term "stranded colourwork" for the generic technique, and reserve the term "Fair Isle" for the characteristic patterns of the Shetland Islands.&lt;ref name="StarmoreFairIsle"&gt;{{cite book |last=Starmore|first=Alice|authorlink=Alice Starmore |date=1990 |title=The Fair Isle Knitting Handbook |location=London |publisher=Blandford |isbn=978-0-7137-2206-2 |oclc=60047818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other techniques for knitting in colour include [[Intarsia (knitting)|intarsia]], [[slip-stitch knitting|slip-stitch colour]] (also known as [[mosaic knitting]]).

== Technique ==
[[File:Prince of Wales, painting by Lander.jpg|thumb|[[Edward VIII|HRH Edward, Prince of Wales]] in a Fair Isle pullover]]
Basic two-colour Fair Isle requires no new techniques beyond the basic knit stitch: the purl stitch is not used if circular knitting needles or 3 double-pointed needles are used.  At each knit stitch, there are two available "active" colours of yarn; one is drawn through to make the knit stitch, and the other is simply held behind the piece, carried as a loose strand of yarn behind the just-made stitch. To avoid "loose" strands larger than 3-5 stitches, the yarn not in use can be "caught" by the yarn in use without this being seen on the front of the work - see below. Knitters who are comfortable with both [[English knitting|English style]] and [[Continental knitting|Continental style]] knitting can carry one colour with their right hand and one with their left, although it is also possible to simply use two different fingers for the two colours of yarn and knit both using the same style.&lt;ref name="McGregorTraditional"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest Fair Isle pattern uses circular or double pointed needles, cast on any number of stitches. Knitting then continues round and round, with the colours alternated every stitch. If the pattern is started with an even number of stitches, a vertically striped tube of fabric will be formed, while an odd number will create a diagonal grid that appears to mix the two colours.

Traditional Fair Isle patterns normally had no more than two or three consecutive stitches of any given colour, because they were ''stranded'', and too many consecutive stitches of one colour means a very long strand of the other, quite easy to catch with a finger or button.  A more modern variation is ''woven'' Fair Isle, where the unused strand is held in slightly different positions relative to the needles and thereby woven into the fabric, still invisible from the front, but trapped closely against the back of the piece.  This permits a nearly limitless variety of patterns with considerably larger blocks of colour.&lt;ref name="StarmoreFairIsle"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Fair Isle jumper construction involves knitting the body of the jumper completely in the round.  ''Steeks'' (from the Scottish word meaning 'stitch', 'to close shut', and comprising several stitches) are worked across the armhole openings allowing the body to be completed in the round without interruption. Once the main body of the jumper is complete, the armhole steeks are cut open (sometimes these are secured before cutting). Stitches are then picked up around the armhole opening and the sleeve is knitted down toward the cuff in the round. 

Since the 1990s, the term "Fair Isle" has been applied very generally and loosely to any stranded colour knitting regardless of its relation to the knitting of Fair Isle or any of the other Shetland Islands.

Geodesign includes project conceptualization, analysis, design specification, stakeholder participation and collaboration, design creation, simulation, and evaluation (among other stages). 

==History==
Geodesign builds greatly on a long history of work in [[geographic information science]], [[computer-aided design]], [[landscape architecture]], and other [[environmental design]] fields. See for instance, the work of [[Ian McHarg]] and [[Carl Steinitz]].  

Members of the various disciplines and practices relevant to geodesign have held defining discussions at a workshop on [http://ncgia.ucsb.edu/projects/scdg/ Spatial Concepts in GIS and Design] in December 2008 and the [http://www.geodesignsummit.com/ GeoDesign Summit] in January 2010. GeoDesign Summit 2010 Conference Videos from [http://www.geodesignsummit.com/videos/day-one.html Day 1] and [http://www.geodesignsummit.com/videos/day-two.html Day 2] are an important resource to learn about the many different aspects of GeoDesign.  ESRI co-founder Jack Dangermond has introduced each of the GeoDesign Summit meetings.  Designer and technologist [[Bran Ferren]], was the keynote speaker for the first and fourth Summit meetings in Redlands, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.esri.com/esri/esri-insider/2013/02/08/a-250-year-plan-for-the-planet/|title=A 250-Year Plan for the Planet {{!}} Esri Insider|website=blogs.esri.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fourth conference he presented a provocative view of how what is needed is a 250-year plan, and how GeoDesign was a key concept in making this a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Five Minutes into the Future: An Argument for Taking a Longer View|url=https://www.esri.com/videos/watch?videoid=2119&amp;title=five-minutes-into-the-future-an-argument-for-taking-a-longer-view|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Steinitz was a presenter at both the 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=esri|title=GeoDesign Summit 2010: Carl Steinitz: Ways of Designing (Part 4 of 4)|date=2010-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HmYxTzPnLY|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Esri Events|title=Esri 2015 Geodesign Summit: Experiments in Geodesign Synthesis|date=2017-12-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czIeEJoEvuo|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summits.

The 2013 Geodesign Summit drew a record 260 attendees from the United States and abroad ([http://video.esri.com watch video coverage of the summit]). That same year, a master's degree in Geodesign ‚Äî the first of its kind in the nation ‚Äî began at [[Philadelphia University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esri.com/news/arcwatch/0113/educating-the-next-generation-in-geodesign.html Goldberg, Debbie. Educating the Next Generation in Geodesign ''ArcWatch'', january 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; Claudia Goetz Phillips, director of Landscape Architecture and GeoDesign at [[Philadelphia University]] says "it is very exciting to be at the forefront of this exciting and relevant paradigm shift in how we address twenty-first-century global to local design and planning issues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcwatch/0313/geodesign-in-motion Wheeler, Carla. Geodesign in Motion ' 'ArcWatch'', march 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The theory underpinning Geodesign derives from the work of [[Patrick Geddes]] in the first half of the twentieth century and [[Ian McHarg]] in its second half. They advocated a layered approach to regional planning, landscape planning and urban planning. McHarg drew the layers on translucent overlays. Through the work of [[Jack Dangermond]], Carl Steinitz, Henk Scholten and others the layers were modeled with  [[Geographical Information Systems]] (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;''Landscape Planning and Environmental Impact Design'', (UCL Press London 1998). {{ISBN|1-85728-321-X}} p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The three components of this term each say something about its character. 'Geographical' implies that the layers are geographical (geology, soils, hydrology, roads, land use etc.). 'Information' implies  a positivist and scientific methodology. 'System' implies the use of computer technology for the information processing.&lt;ref&gt;''Landscape Planning and Environmental Impact Design'', (UCL Press London 1998). {{ISBN|1-85728-321-X}} p.20&lt;/ref&gt;
The scientific aspects of Geodesign contrast with the cultural emphasis of [[Landscape urbanism|Landscape Urbanism]] but the two approaches to landscape planning share a concern for layered analysis &lt;ref&gt;Pe, R. (2012) Hyper-localism and Parametric Mapping for Collaborative Urbanism. ''Digital Landscape Architecture conference, 31 May 2012''&lt;/ref&gt; which sits comfortably with [[postmodernism|postmodern]] and [[post-postmodernism|post-postmodern]] theory.

==Technologies==
Nascent geodesign technology extends [[geographic information systems]] so that in addition to analyzing existing environments and [[geodata]], users can synthesize new environments and modify geodata.  See, for example, [[CommunityViz]] or [[marinemap]].

"GeoDesign brings geographic analysis into the design process, where initial design sketches are instantly vetted for suitability against myriad database layers describing a variety of physical and social factors for the spatial extent of the project. This on-the-fly suitability analysis provides a framework for design, giving land-use planners, engineers, transportation planners, and others involved with design, the tools to leverage geographic information within their design workflows."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/summer09articles/gis-designing-our-future.html Dangermond, Jack. GIS: Designing Our Future ''ArcNews'', summer 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4087">The '''Guggenheim International Award''' was established in 1956 as "both a recognition of outstanding achievements in the visual arts and an important manifestation of international goodwill".  A shortlist of artists and works were selected by juries to represent different countries, with one overall winner selected by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] and awarded a monetary prize of US$10,000, then the largest art prize awarded in the US.  Prizes were given every two years from 1956 to 1964 (omitting 1962).  The award was discontinued after 1964 in order to divert funds to acquiring further artwork for the Foundation.

Contemporary typographers view typography as a craft with a very long [[history]] tracing its origins back to the first punches and dies used to make [[Seal (device)|seal]]s and [[currency]] in [[Ancient history|ancient times]]. The basic elements of typography are at least as old as [[civilization]] and the earliest [[writing system]]s&amp;mdash;a series of key developments that were eventually drawn together into one, systematic craft.

__TOC__

==Medieval design roots==
[[File:Gutenberg bible Old Testament Epistle of St Jerome.jpg|thumb|top|200px|First page of the first volume of the [[Gutenberg Bible]], printed with an early [[textualis|textur]] typeface c. 1455. In this copy the [[decorative]] colored initials were [[calligraphy|hand-lettered]] separately by a scribe.]]

Typography, type-founding and typeface design began as closely related crafts in mid-15th-century Europe with the introduction of [[movable type]] [[Printing press|printing]] at the junction of the medieval era and the [[Renaissance]]. Handwritten letterforms of the mid-15th century embodied 3000&amp;nbsp;years of evolved letter design, and were the natural models for letterforms in systematized typography. The scribal letter known as ''[[textualis|textur]]'' or ''textualis'', produced by the strong [[Gothic art|gothic]] spirit of [[blackletter]] from the hands of German area scribes, served as the model for the first text types.

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] employed the [[scribe]] [[Peter Sch√∂ffer]] to help design and cut the letterpunches for the first typeface&amp;mdash;the [[D-K type]] of 202 characters used to print the first printed books in Europe. A second typeface of about 300 characters designed for the [[Gutenberg Bible|42-line Bible]] c. 1455 was probably cut by the goldsmith Hans Dunne with the help of two others&amp;mdash;G√∂tz von Shlettstadt and [[Hans von Speyer]].

Cultural tradition ensured that German typography and type design remained true to the gothic/blackletter spirit; but the parallel influence of the humanist and neo-classical typography in Italy (the second country where movable type printing was done) catalyzed textur into four additional sub-styles that were distinct, structurally rich and highly disciplined: [[Bastarda]], [[Fraktur (typeface sub-classification)|fraktur]], [[Rotunda (script)|rotunda]], and [[Schwabacher]].

The rapid spread of movable type printing across Europe produced additional Gothic, half-Gothic and Gothic-to-Roman transitional types. [[Johann B√§mler]]'s Schwabacher, [[Augsburg (typeface)|Augsburg]] appeared in 1474. The half-Gothic Rotunda type of [[Erhard Ratdolt]] c. 1486 was cut to suit [[Venice|Venetian]] taste. In 1476 [[William Caxton]], having learned his craft on the Continent, printed the first books in England with a so-called B√¢tarde type (an early Schwabacher design), but soon abandoned it.

The early printers of Spain were Germans who began by printing in up-to-date roman types but soon gave these up and adopted Gothic typefaces based on the letterforms of Spanish manuscripts. [[Valencia]] in the Kingdom of Aragon was the location of the first press, established in 1473. From there printers moved to other cities to set up presses. Roman types were used by the printers of Salamanca for their editions of classical authors. Printing in Portuguese began at Lisbon in 1495 (the first book printed in Portugal was a Hebrew book printed in 1489).&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, S. H. (1961) ''Five Hundred Years of Printing''. Harmondsworth: Penguin; pp. 94, 96, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical revival==
In [[Italy]] the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by ''Venetian'' or "old style" Latin types, also called [[Antiqua (typeface class)|antiqua]]. The [[Roman square capitals|inscriptional capitals]] on [[ancient Rome|Roman]] buildings and [[monument]]s were structured on a [[Euclidean geometry|euclidean]] [[geometry|geometric]] scheme and the [[Classical order|discrete component-based model]] of [[classical architecture]]. Their structurally perfect design, near-perfect execution in stone, balanced angled stressing, contrasting thick and thin strokes, and incised [[serif]]s became the typographic ideal for [[Western culture|western civilization]]. The best-known example of Roman [[Roman square capitals|inscriptional capitals]] exists on the base of Trajan's Column, inscribed c. 113.

[[File:Trajan inscription duotone.jpg|thumb|center|580px|'''[[Roman square capitals|Roman inscriptional capitals]]''' on the base of '''[[Trajan's Column]]''', c. 113.]]

In their enthusiastic [[Neoclassicism|revival of classical culture]], Italian scribes and [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars of the early 15th century searched for ancient lower case letters to match the Roman inscriptional capitals. Practically all of the available manuscripts of classical writers had been rewritten during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], and with a lapse of three hundred years since the widespread use of this style, the humanist scribes mistook [[Carolingian minuscule]] as the authentic writing style of the ancients. Dubbing it ''lettera antica'', they began by copying the minuscule hand almost exactly, combining it with Roman capitals in the same manner as the manuscripts they were copying.&lt;ref name="nesbitt"&gt;Nesbitt, Alexander ''The History and Technique of Lettering'' (c) 1957, [[Dover Publications|Dover Publications, Inc.]] {{ISBN|0-486-20427-8}}  {{OCLC|654540}}. The Dover edition is an abridged and corrected republication of the work originally published in 1950 by Prentice-Hall, Inc. under the title ''Lettering: The History and Technique of Lettering as Design''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carolingian sample.png|thumb|center|538px|'''Sample of Carolingian writing''' from the [[Carolingian Gospel Book (British Library, MS Add. 11848)|Carolingian Gospel Book produced between 820 and 830 AD]]]]

Upon noticing the stylistic mismatch between these two very different letters, the scribes redesigned the small Carolingian letter, lengthening ascenders and descenders, and adding incised serifs and finishing strokes to integrate them with the Roman capitals. By the time [[movable type|moveable type]] reached Italy several decades later, the humanistic writing had evolved into a consistent model known as [[Humanist minuscule|humanistic minuscule]], which served as the basis for type style we know today as Venetian.&lt;ref name="nesbitt"/&gt;

==Transition from humanistic minuscule to roman type==
The classically endowed city of [[Rome]] attracted the first printers known to have set up shop outside Germany, [[Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim]], closely followed by the brothers [[Johann and Wendelin of Speyer]] (de Spira), and the Frenchman [[Nicolas Jenson]]. The sequence of appearance and production dates for types used by these printers have yet to be established with certainty; all four are known to have printed with types ranging from textur Gothic to fully developed romans inspired by the earlier humanistic writing, and within a few years the center of printing in Italy shifted from Rome to [[Venice]].

Some time before 1472 in Venice, Johann and Wendelin issued material printed with a half-Gothic-half-roman type known as "Gotico-antiqua". This design paired simplified Gothic capitals with a rationalized humanistic minuscule letter set, itself combining Gothic minuscule forms with elements of Carolingian, in a one step forward, half step back blending of styles.

Around the same time (1468) in Rome, Pannartz and Sweynheim were using another typeface that closely mimicked humanistic minuscule, known as "Lactantius". Unlike the rigid fractured forms of Speyer's half-Gothic, the Lactantius is characterized by smoothly rendered letters with a restrained organic finish. The Lactantius '''a''' departed from both the Carolingian and Gothic models; a vertical backstem and right-angled top replaced the diagonal Carolingian structure, and a continuous curved stroke replaced the fractured Gothic bowl element.

For details on the evolution of lower case letterforms from Latin capitals, see [[Latin alphabet]].

==Development of roman type==
&lt;!-- "Whiteletter" in "Broadside (music)" links directly to this section. Please don't change the heading without doing the link as well‚Äîthanks. --&gt;[[Nicolas Jenson]] began printing in Venice with his original roman font from 1470. Jenson's design and the very similar roman types cut by [[Francesco Griffo]] c. 1499 and Erhard Ratdolt c. 1486 are acknowledged as the definitive and [[archetype|archetypal]] roman faces that set the pattern for the majority of western text faces that followed.

The Jenson roman was an explicitly typographic letter designed on its own terms that declined to imitate the appearance of hand-lettering. Its effect is one of a unified cohesive whole, a seamless fusion of style with structure, and the successful convergence of the long progression of preceding letter styles. Jenson adapted the structural unity and component-based modular integration of Roman capitals to humanistic minuscule forms by masterful [[Abstraction|abstract]] stylization. The carefully modelled [[serifs]] follow an artful [[logic]] of [[asymmetry]]. The [[ratio]] of extender lengths to letter bodies and the distance between lines results in balanced, harmonious body of type. Jenson also mirrors the ideal expressed in renaissance painting of carving up space (typographic "white space") with figures (letters) to articulate the relationship between the two and make the white space dynamic.

[[File:Jenson 1475 venice laertius.png|center|thumb|600px|'''[[Nicolas Jenson]]'s roman type''' used in Venice c. 1470. Later "old style" or Venetian book romans such as [[Aldus Manutius|Aldines]], and much later [[Bembo]], were closely based on Jenson.]]

The name "roman" is customarily applied uncapitalized to distinguish early Jenson and Aldine-derived types from classical Roman letters of antiquity. Some parts of Europe call roman "antiqua" from its connection with the humanistic "lettera antica"; "medieval" and "old-style" are also employed to indicate roman types dating from the late 15th century, especially those used by [[Aldus Manutius]] (Italian: Manuzio). Roman faces based on those of Speyer and Jenson are also called Venetian.

==Italic type==
The humanist spirit driving the Renaissance produced its own unique style of formal writing, known as "cursiva humanistica". This slanted and rapidly written letter evolved from humanistic minuscule and the remaining Gothic current cursive hands in Italy, served as the model for ''[[cursive]]'' or italic typefaces. As books printed with early roman types forced humanistic minuscule out of use, cursiva humanistica gained favor as a manuscript hand for the purpose of writing. The popularity of cursive writing itself may have created some demand for a type of this style. The more decisive catalyst was probably the printing of pocket editions of [[Latin literature|Latin classics]] by Aldus Manutius.

The "Aldino" italic type, commissioned by Manutius and cut by Francesco Griffo in 1499, was a closely spaced condensed type. Griffo's punches are a delicate translation of the Italian cursive hand, featuring letters of irregular slant angle and uneven height and vertical position, with some connected pairs (''[[Ligature (typography)|ligature]]s''), and unslanted small roman capitals the height of the lower case '''t'''. The fame of Aldus Manutius and his editions made the Griffo italic widely copied and influential, although it was not the finest of the pioneer italics. The "Aldino" style quickly became known as "italic" from its Italian origin.

Around 1527 the Vatican chancellery scribe [[Ludovico Arrighi]] designed a superior italic type and had the punches cut by Lauticio di Bartolomeo dei Rotelli. The more modular structure of Arrighi's italic and its few ligatures made it less a copy of the cursive hand than Griffo's. Its slightly taller roman capitals, a gentler slant angle, taller ascenders and wider separation of lines gave the elegant effect of refined handwriting.

[[File:Arrighi italic.png|center|thumb|600px|'''Italic type''' designed by Ludovico Arrighi, c. 1527. This elegant design inspired later French italic types.]]

Surviving examples of 16th-century Italian books indicate the bulk of them were printed with italic types. By mid-century the popularity of italic types for sustained text setting began to decline until they were used only for in-line citations, block quotes, preliminary text, emphasis, and abbreviations. Italic types from the 20th century up to the present are much indebted to Arrighi and his influence on French designers.

Swiss art historian [[Jakob Burckhardt]] described the classically inspired Renaissance ''modello'' of dual case roman and cursive italic types as "The model and ideal for the whole western world". Venetian pre-eminence in type design was brought to an end by the political and economic turmoil that concluded the Renaissance in Italy with the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome in 1527]].

==Renaissance Germany and Switzerland==
Soon after 1500, roman typefaces began to gain popularity north of the Alps for printing of Latin literature.  [[Johann Froben]] of [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] set up his press in 1491, and by about 1519 (when he printed [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]'s famous edition of the Greek [[New Testament]]) he had established a set of standards for humanistic printing which were widely copied throughout the German-speaking world and also in [[Spain]] and, to a lesser extent in England.  His principal type is wholly roman in the shape of the characters but retains an echo of gothic influence in the angled serifs and the way the thick and thin strokes are organized; it was coupled with mated sets of woodcut initials (often designed by distinguished artists) and with two larger sizes of uppercase letters for use in title pages and headings‚ÄîFroben was the first to use such 'display faces' consistently, breaking away from the Italian tradition in which title pages and headings tended to be set in the same size as the main text.  By using these large faces, Froben developed the title page as a fully organized artistic whole. Froben's italic face is based on that of Aldus but more even and uniform in effect.  These Swiss books are the first to have been designed in every detail as printed artifacts rather than as adaptations of manuscript technique.

After about 1550 this Swiss/German tradition was gradually overwhelmed by French influence.  Towards the end of the 16th century, the [[Wechel]] family of [[Frankfurt]], previously based in Paris, was producing fine books which used French typefaces in conjunction with heavy but resplendent woodcut ornaments to achieve a splendid page effect;  but soon after 1600 there was a general, marked decline in the quality of both skill and materials, from which German printing did not recover until the 20th century.

==16th century France==
Typography was introduced to France by the German printers Martin Crantz, Michael Freyburger and Ulrich Gering, who set up a press in [[Paris]] in 1470, where they printed with an inferior copy of the Lactantius type. Gothic types dominated in France until the end of the 15th century, when they were gradually supplanted by roman designs. [[Jodocus Badius Ascensius]] (Josse Bade) in partnership with [[Henri Estienne]] established a press in Paris in 1503. Printing with undeveloped Roman and half-Gothic types, the French pair were too occupied meeting the demand for Humanistic and classical texts to design any original types of their own. French books nonetheless began to follow the format established by Italian printers, and [[Lyon]] and Paris became the new centers of activity. Eventually, the French government fixed a standard height for all type, to ensure that different batches could be used together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=Encyclop√©die ou Dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des arts et des m√©tiers|date=1765|location=Paris|pages=Vol. 8, p. 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De Colines, Estienne, and Augereau===
After their 1494 invasion of Italy the French were greatly influenced by Renaissance culture, and later set about converting French culture from Gothic to neo-classical. The required phonetic and orthographic changes to French language hindered the evolution of type design in France until the late 1520s. At the end of this period roman types introduced by [[Robert Estienne]], [[Simon de Colines]] and Antoine Augereau began a phase of type design with a distinctly French character. Robert Estienne carried on the establishment of his father Henri Estienne, who had died in 1520. Simon de Colines had been the elder Estienne's assistant, married his widow, and set up his own press.

The de Colines roman of 1531 resembled Griffo's 1499 roman but did not copy it closely. Narrower forms and tighter letter fit; '''a''' with low angled bowl; elevated triangular stem serifs on '''i''', '''j''', '''m''', '''n''' and '''r'''; flattened [[baseline (typography)|baseline]] serifs, delicately modeled [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] serifs and graceful, fluid lines characterize the French style. Robert Estienne's roman of 1532 was similar to the de Colines face, which Estienne complemented with a fine italic type based on that of Arrighi. The craftsmen who cut the punches for the romans used by Estienne and de Colines remain unidentified. In 1532 Antoine Augereau cut the punches for a roman type very close to Estienne's. The lower cases of the Estienne and Augereau types became the basis for post-Renaissance old style typography, and were copied by French typographers for the next 150&amp;nbsp;years.

===Garamond===
[[File:GaramondSpecimenA.svg|right|thumb|200px|'''Garamond type''' revival by [[Robert Slimbach]].]]

The svelte French style reached its fullest refinement in the roman types attributed to the best-known figure of French typography&amp;mdash;[[Claude Garamond]] (also Garamont). In 1541 [[Robert Estienne]], printer to the king, helped Garamond obtain commissions to cut the sequence of Greek fonts for King [[Francis I of France]], known as the "[[grecs du roi]]". A number of roman faces used in Garamond's publishing activities can be positively attributed to him as punch-cutter. From the dates of their appearance, and their similarity to romans used by Estienne, [[Christoffel Plantijn]] and the printer Andr√© Wechel, the types known as "Canon de Garamond" and "Petit Canon de Garamond" shown on a specimen sheet issued by the Egenolff-Berner foundry in 1592 are generally accepted as [[Garamond|Claude Garamond's final roman types]].

===Robert Granjon===
[[File:Evangelium Sanctum Domini Nostri Jesu Christi in Arabic 1590 with Arabic types of Robert Grandjon Rome Typographia Medicea.jpg|thumb|left|''Evangelium Sanctum Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'' in [[Arabic]], 1590, with Arabic types of Robert Grandjon, ''[[Typographia Medicea]]'', [[Rome]].]]
[[Robert Granjon]] worked in the second half of the 16th century, mainly at Lyon, but was also recorded at Paris, Rome and [[Antwerp]]. He is still famous because of his [[Civilit√©]] types, imitating French gothic cursive calligraphy.  His main contribution was an italic type known as "Parangon de Granjon". Italic type design had apparently become corrupted since the Arrighi and Aldine models. Granjon's italic had a greater slant angle, slanted roman capitals, and reduced weight and rigor. These qualities and its contrasting thick and thin strokes gave it a dazzling appearance that made it difficult to read. It was nevertheless the main influence for italic type design until the Arrighi model was revived in 1920.

In the 16th century, Western printers also developed Oriental types, such as [[Fran√ßois Savary de Br√®ves]] or Robert Granjon, usually with the objective of proselytizing the Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/orient.html Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture/ Orient to Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition to modern type: 17th and 18th century==
[[Baroque]] and [[rococo]] aesthetic trends, use of the pointed-pen for writing, and steel [[engraving]] techniques effected a gradual shift in typographic style. Contrast between thick and thin strokes increased. Tilted stressing transformed into vertical stressing; full rounds were compressed. Blunt bracketed serifs grew sharp and delicate until they were fine straight lines. Detail became clean and precise.

Transitional roman types combined the classical features of lettera antiqua with the vertical stressing and higher contrast between thick and thin strokes characteristic of the true modern romans to come.

The roman types used c. 1618 by the Dutch printing firm of [[House of Elzevir|Elzevir]] in [[Leyden]] reiterated the 16th-century French style with higher contrast, less rigor and a lighter page effect. After 1647 most Elzevir faces were cut by the highly regarded Christoffel van Dyck, whose precise renditions were regarded by some experts at the time as finer than Garamond's.

===Fell types===
[[File:Fell english roman thumb.png|thumb|200px|right|Specimen of '''Fell type''' English roman, quoting [[Cicero]]'s [[In_Catilinam#Oratio_in_Catilinam_Prima_in_Senatu_Habita|First Oration against Catiline]].]]

From mid-16th century until the end of the 17th, interference with printing by the British Crown thwarted the development of [[type foundry|type founding]] in England&amp;mdash;most type used by 17th-century English printers was of Dutch origin. The lack of material inspired Bishop of Oxford [[John Fell (clergyman)|Doctor John Fell]] to purchase punches &amp; matrices from Holland c. 1670&amp;ndash;1672 for use by the [[Oxford University Press]]. The so-named Fell types, presumed to be the work of Dutch [[punchcutting|punchcutter]] Dirck Voskens, mark a noticeable jump from previous designs, with considerably shorter extenders, higher stroke contrast, narrowing of round letters, and flattened serifs on the baseline and descenders. The design retained a retrogressive old-style irregularity, smooth modeling from vertical to horizontal, and angled stressing of rounds (except a vertically stressed '''o'''). Fell capitals were condensed, even-width, with wide flattened serifs; all characteristics of the definitive modern romans of the late 18th century. Fell italic types were distinguished by high contrast matching the Fell romans; wider ovals; a split-branching stroke from the stems of '''m n r''' and '''u'''; and long, flat serifs&amp;mdash;prefiguring modern. They repeated the non-uniform slant of French models, and the capitals included swash '''J''' and '''Q''' forms.

An open-source digitisation of the Fell Types has been released by designer and engineer Igino Marini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marini|first1=Igino|title=The Fell Types|url=http://iginomarini.com/fell/|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caslon===
[[File:Caslon english roman thumb.png|thumb|200px|right|'''[[Caslon|Caslon English roman]]''', from a sample issued by the Caslon foundry and quoting the same text. Compare against the Fell type.]]
The first major figure in English typography is reckoned by type historians to have ended the monopoly of Dutch type founding almost single-handedly. The gun engraver-turned-punchcutter [[William Caslon]] spent 14&amp;nbsp;years creating the [[Caslon|stable of typefaces on the specimen sheet issued in 1734]]. The complete canon included roman, italic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic ''etc.'' Caslon's Great Primer roman and English roman were retrogressive designs that very closely followed the Fell types and the roman of Mikl√≥s (Nicholas) Kis c. 1685 falsely attributed to [[Anton Janson]]. Like the Fells, Caslon's slightly bracketed serifs and old-style irregularity gave it a homely charm&amp;mdash;its precise cut and perpendicularity place it firmly in the 18th century however. Caslon's italic structures follow the Fell italics, but at a condensed width and with conventional branching from stems.

William Caslon's prodigious output was influential worldwide. Caslon type and its imitations were used throughout the expanding [[British empire]]. It was the dominant type in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] for the second half of the 18th century. Caslon marks the rise of England as the center of typographic activity.

===Fleischmann===
[[Joan Micha√´l Fleischman]] (1701&amp;ndash;1768) was born in [[N√ºrnberg]] where he trained as a punchcutter. He found employment with Dutch type founders in Holland and settled there c. 1728. At the Ensched√© foundry in [[Haarlem]] he cut punches for a large amount of material. Some time after 1743 he produced a distinguished roman design&amp;mdash;related to the preceding transitional types but departing from them. It prefigured modern romans with sparse transaxial modeling joining the vertical stressing to hairline thins, and ball-ends. Fleischmann borrowed from the general mode of Phillipe Grandjean‚Äôs and Louis Simonneau‚Äôs "[[Romain du Roi]]," commissioned by [[Louis XIV]] in 1692&lt;ref name="meggs58"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Meggs | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B. Meggs | title = A History of Graphic Design | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | year = 1998 | location =  | edition = Third | pages = 108‚Äì109 | isbn = 978-0-471-29198-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Imprimerie Royale, but did not imitate that face. Fleischmann's capitals were a new variety; an even-width scheme, compressed rounds, all-vertical stressing, and triangular beak ends of '''E F L T''' and '''Z''', all characteristics prefiguring the "classical" moderns of [[Bodoni]] and [[Didot (typeface)|Didot]]. Fleischmann's italic bore some resemblance to Granjean's but had longer ascenders and followed the established Dutch structures for '''h v''' and '''w'''.

Fleischmann was held in great esteem by his contemporaries, his designs exerting a decisive influence in the last quarter of the 18th century. Renowned French punchcutter [[Pierre Simon Fournier]] (1712‚Äì1768), confessed to having copied Fleischmann's design, and was first to dub "contrast" types like the Fells, Caslon and Fleischmann "modern". Fournier's rococo-influenced designs&amp;mdash;Fournier and Narcissus&amp;mdash;and his Mod√®les des Caract√®res (1742) continued the romaine du roi style and adapted it for his own modern age. Like Baskerville, his italics were inspired by handwriting and the engraved lettering known as [[copperplate_script | copperplate]] hand. Fournier also published a two volume ''Manuel Typographique'', in which he recorded much European typographic history, and introduced the first standardized system of type size measurement&amp;mdash;the "point".

===Baskerville===
[[File:basker specimen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|'''The [[Baskerville]] typeface''' designed by John Baskerville.]]
The roman and italic types of [[John Baskerville]] c. 1772 appeared later than Fleischman's but are considered transitional and partly retrogressive with a return to lower contrast, smooth transaxial modeling, finely modeled bracketed serifs, and long stems. The exquisite design and finish of Baskerville's roman however, combining elegance and strength, was modern. His roman design, and especially his italic, were rococo-influenced. His designs did not visibly quote any previous types. They were informed by his prior experience as a writing master and the influences of his time. The types of Joseph Fry, Alexander Wilson, and John Bell closely followed Baskerville, and through his correspondence with European type founders Baskerville's influence penetrated most of western Europe. Baskerville was a meticulous artist who controlled all aspects of his creation, devising more accurate presses, blacker inks and paper sealed with hot rollers to ensure crisp impressions. Of particular note, the lower storey of his lowercase g does not fully close. Derivatives of Baskerville are often identified thus. A modern revival of Baskerville, a font called [[Mrs Eaves]], is named after Baskerville's wife who was the widow of Richard Eaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Penney|first=Chris|title=Dr B T Davis's bequest|journal=Research Libraries Bulletin|issue=6|page=21|issn=1355-9877|url=http://www.special-coll.bham.ac.uk/rlb_autumn98.pdf|accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern romans===
[[File:Bodoni mt thumb ls.png|thumb|200px|right|'''[[Facsimile]] of sample''' published with genuine [[Bodoni]] types by the Officina Bodoni in 1925. The font shown is the digital Bodoni [[Monotype]] c. 1999.]][[File:AFDidotSpecimen.svg|right|thumb|200px|'''Didot type''' Revival designed in 1991 by Adrian Frutiger for [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company|Linotype foundry]].]]
True modern romans arrived with the types of the Italian [[Giambattista Bodoni]] and the French [[Didot family|Didot]]s. Completing trends begun by the Fell types, Fleischman, Fournier and Baskerville, the so-called "classical" modern romans eschewed [[chirography|chirographic]] and organic influences, their synthetic [[Symmetry|symmetric]] geometry answering to a rationalized and reformed classical model driven by the [[Cartesian coordinate system|strict cartesian grid]] philosophy of [[Ren√© Descartes]] and the predictable clockwork universe of [[Isaac Newton]].

The "classical" appellation of modern romans stems from their return to long ascenders and descenders set on widely spaced lines, and a corresponding light page effect reminiscent of old-style&amp;mdash;occurring at a time of classical revival.

Bodoni was foremost in progressing from rococo to the new classical style. He produced an italic very close to Baskerville's, and a French cursive script type falling in between italic type and joined scripts. The roman types of [[Didot family#Fran√ßois-Ambroise Didot|Francois Ambroise Didot]] and son [[Firmin Didot]] closely resemble the work of Bodoni, and opinion is divided over whether the Didots or Bodoni originated the first modern romans. At any rate the Didots' mathematical precision and vanishing of rococo design reflected the "enlightenment" of post-revolution France under [[Napoleon]]. Francois Ambroise also designed "maigre" and "gras" types corresponding to later condensed and expanded font formats.

The Spanish designer [[Joaqu√≠n Ibarra]]'s roman was influenced by Baskerville, Didot and Bodoni, but hewn nearer to old-style and used in the same classical manner, including spaced capitals. In England modern romans resembling Bodoni's were cut for the printer [[William Bulmer]] c. 1786 by the punchcutter William Martin, who had been apprenticed to Baskerville and influenced by him. Martin's italic mirrored the open-tail '''g''' and overall finesse of Baskerville's.

In Britain and the United States, modern romans (emerging around 1800 and totally dominant by the 1820s) took a somewhat more rounded, less geometrical form than the designs of Didot and Bodoni; an obvious difference is that in Anglo-American faces the upper-case C has only one serif (at the top) whereas in European designs it has two.

== 19th and 20th century typography ==
&lt;!-- E.g., Art deco and art nouveau fonts --&gt;

===Industrialization===
The 19th century brought fewer stylistic innovations. The most notable invention was the rise of typefaces with strengthened serifs. Forerunners were the so-called [[Slab serif|Egyptienne]] fonts, which were used already at the beginning of the 19th century. Their name likely comes from the enthusiasm of the Napoleonic era for the orient, which in turn was started by Napoleon's [[French Invasion of Egypt (1798)|invasion in Egypt]]. In fact slab-serif fonts (''e.&amp;thinsp;g.'' [[Clarendon (typeface)|Clarendon]] from 1845) were newspaper fonts, whose serifs were strengthened in order to prevent damage during the printing process. Stylistically the serif fonts of the mid-19th century appeared very robust and otherwise had more or less neo-classical design features, which changed during the course of time: By the application of the slab serif design feature and by appending serifs to more and more typefaces, an independent intermediate group of heterogeneous fonts emerged during the 20th century. Meanwhile, the slab serifs are listed as an independent group in most typeface classifications&amp;mdash;besides both main groups '''serif''' and '''sans serif'''.

Slab-serif and sanserif types were rarely used for continuous bodies of text; their realm was that of advertisements, title-pages and other attention-catching pieces of print. By about 1820, most western countries were using modern romans and italics for continuous texts. This remained true until the 1860s, when so-called 'old style' faces&amp;mdash;a largely English-speaking phenomenon&amp;mdash;came into use. These went to the opposite extreme from the modern faces; 'thick' strokes were attenuated, and serifs at the end of thin strokes (as in C, E, L and T) were narrow and angled whereas in modern faces they were broad and vertical or nearly so. All the upper-case characters were somewhat 'condensed' (narrowed). Old style faces remained popular until about 1910.

Above all the 19th century was innovative regarding technical aspects. Automatic manufacturing processes changed the print as well as the graphical illustrations. The illustration of printed matters could be considerably standardised due to the [[lithography]] technique invented by [[Alois Senefelder]]. Finally, another invention was [[photography]], whose establishment at the end of the 19th century led to the first [[halftone|halftoning]] and reproduction procedures. The step-by-step development of a modern mass society provided a growing demand of printed matters. Besides the traditional letterpress beginnings of a newspaper landscape as well as a broad market for publications, advertisements, and posters of all kinds appeared. The challenges had changed: since printing and typography had been a straightforward craft for centuries, it now had to face the challenges of an industry-ruled mass society.

===Hot type and phototypesetting in the 20th century===
[[File:Monotype-machine.jpg|thumb|left|[[Monotype Corporation|Monotype]] machine]]
[[File:exlibris-1921.png|thumb|left|[[Bookplate|Exlibris]], 1921]]
The 90 years between 1890 and 1980 coined typography until now. The craft of printing became an industry, and the typography became a part of it as well. Both stylistically and technologically this epoch was really tumultuous. The significant developments were the following:
*The fabrication and application of typefaces more and more were affected by industrial '''manufacturing processes'''. Significant incidents were the invention of the [[Hot metal typesetting|hot type]] machine by [[Ottmar Mergenthaler]] ([[Linotype machine]], 1886) and [[Tolbert Lanston]] ([[Monotype Corporation|Monotype machine]], 1887) and a few decades later the emergence of [[phototypesetting]]. The result: Compilation and typographical design of the text could be more and more controlled by keyboards in contrast to manual typesetting.
*A result of the industrialisation process was the unimagined '''number and distribution of new typefaces'''. Whether [[Digital data|digital]] variants of ''Garamond'' and ''Bodoni'' or new contemporary type designs like ''[[Futura (typeface)|Futura]]'', ''[[Times Roman|Times]]'', and ''[[Helvetica]]'', nearly all currently used typefaces have their origin either in the following and ongoing [[Typesetting#Digital era|digital typesetting era]] or are based on designs of this epoch. The basis was the appearance of large [[type foundry|type foundries]] and type manufacturers. The result: Successful typefaces could quickly gain the status of a trademark&amp;mdash;and therefore were able to assign a unique "[[brand]]ing" to products or publications.
*Besides the traditional typography of books '''[[graphic design]]''' became a more or less independent branch. The tensions between those two branches significantly determined the stylistic development of 20th century's typography.

===Art nouveau and New Book Art===
[[File:Typeface-eckmann.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eckmann (typeface)|Eckmann]], 1901.]]
Since [[impressionism]] the modern art styles were reflected in graphic design and typography too. Since 1890 the [[Art nouveau]] became popular. Its floral ornaments, the curved forms, as well as the emphasis on graphical realisation inspired the type designers of the start of the 20th century. A popular art nouveau font was the ''[[Eckmann (typeface)|Eckmann]]'' designed by graphic artist [[Otto Eckmann]]. Furthermore, the influence of art nouveau was expressed in a lot of book illustrations and [[Bookplate|exlibris]] designs.

Altogether the return to the roots of book art become stronger around the start of the 20th century. It was initiated by British typographer, socialist, and [[private press]] publisher [[William Morris]] as well as by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], which refers to him. Essentially this movement initiated three things: a return to the antiqua-models of the Renaissance, clarity and simplicity of book illustrations, and straightforward technical processes during the production of printed matters. An immediate consequence of the Arts and Crafts Movement was the establishment of the private press movement, which more or less was committed to Morris' ideals, and whose remains partially are still present today. An established meeting point of this scene in Germany for example is the [[Mainzer Minipressen-Messe]], which actually is held every two years.

Especially the [[New Book Art]] movement, which formed in the decade before [[World War I]], was influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement. The young type designers of the pre-war era, among them [[Fritz Helmuth Ehmcke]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Kleukens]], rejected both the late typographical classicism and the ornaments of the popular Art nouveau. The new ideal became a tidy and straightforward book typography, which dedicated itself to the ideas of the Renaissance. [[Walter Tiemann]] in Leipzig, [[Friedrich Hermann Ernst Schneidler]] in Stuttgart, and [[Rudolf Koch]] in Offenbach as instructors were the mentors of this kind of typography. They stayed influential in the field of book typesetting until a long time after the end of [[World War II]].

{{Quran}}

The '''history of Quran''' refers to the oral revelation of the [[Quran]] to Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and its subsequent written compilation into a manuscript. It spans several decades and forms an important part of early [[Islamic history]].

According to Muslim belief and Islamic scholarly accounts, the revelation of the [[Quran]] began in 610 C.E. when the angel [[Gabriel]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ÿ¨ÿ®ÿ±ŸäŸÑ, ''Jibrƒ´l'' or ÿ¨ÿ®ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ŸäŸÑ, ''JibrƒÅ æƒ´l'') appeared to Muhammad in the cave [[Hira]] near [[Mecca]], reciting to him the first [[Ayat|verse]]s of [[Sura]] [[Iqra]] (al-`Alaq). Throughout his life,  Muhammad continued to have revelations until before his death in 632.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donner|first=Fred|title=Muhammad and the Believers: at the Origins of Islam|year=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=London, England|isbn=978-0-674-05097-6|pages=153‚Äì154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran as it is known in the present, was first compiled into book format by [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] and other scribes under the third [[caliph]] [[Uthman]] ([[R.#Historiography|r.]] 644‚Äì56). For this reason, the Quran as it exists today is also known as the Uthmanic codex.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} According to Professor [[Francis Edward Peters]] (1927), what was done to the Quran in the process seems to have been extremely conservative and the content was formed in a mechanical fashion to avoid redactional bias.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters, The Quest of the Historical Muhammad, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 23, No. 3 (August 1991), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin according to Islamic tradition==
{{See also|Wahy}}
{{Muhammad}}
According to traditional Islamic beliefs, the Quran was revealed to [[Muhammad]], starting one night during the month of [[Ramadan]] in 610 AD, when he, at the age of forty, received the first revelation from the angel Gabriel, who had given him the responsibility for inscribing these messages from [[God in Islam|God]] to give to mankind.&lt;ref name=WSU&gt;{{cite web|author=Muslim Information Service of Australia |url=http://www.missionislam.com/quran/beginrevelation.htm |title=Beginning of Revelation |publisher=Missionislam.com |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran uses the term ''ummi'' to describe Muhammad. The majority of Muslim scholars interpret this word as a reference to an illiterate individual, though some modern scholars instead interpret it as a reference to those who belong to a community without a [[People of the Book|scripture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Illiterate Prophet (Nabi Ummi): An inquiry into the development of a dogma in Islamic tradition|volume=57|journal=Islam|page=58-68|year=1980|last1=Goldfield|first1=Isaiah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reza Aslan|title=No God But God: The Origins, Evolution and Future of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HP1zoWqpqg4C&amp;pg=PA6|date=2 December 2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-0928-5|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] (810‚Äì870), Muhammad's wife [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid]] described that the first Quranic revelation occurred when the angel Gabriel visited Muhammad and asked him to recite. Muhammad responded ''ma ana bƒ´qƒÅre'u'', which could be translated into a number of ways: 'I do not read' or 'what am I to read/recite?' or 'I will not read/recite'. Gabriel pressed him "until all the strength went out of me; thereupon he released me and said: 'Read!'" This was repeated three times and upon the third, Gabriel released him and said, "Read in the name of the Sustainer who created humankind from a clot! Read! And your Sustainer is the most Beautiful."&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Esack|first=Farid|title=The Qur'an: A User's Guide|year=2005|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford England|isbn=978-1851683543}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39‚Äì41}} After this Muhammad continued to have revelations sporadically over a period of twenty-three years, until shortly before his death in 11/632.&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|45}}

Muslims believe that Gabriel brought the word of God to Muhammad verbatim, without any alteration or change. The Quran emphasizes that Muhammad was required only to receive the sacred text and that he had no authority to change it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|10|15|s=r|t=p}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that God did not make himself known through the revelations; it was his will that was revealed. There is nothing in the Quran that suggests that Muhammad saw God during his revelations.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 540‚Äì543"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-32639-7|pages=540‚Äì543|chapter=Revelation}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Muhammad, the revelations were real and he believed the context was objective, but he was only able to describe the experience through metaphorical terms.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 540‚Äì543"/&gt;

When asked about the experience of revelation, Muhammad reported:

:''"Sometimes it is revealed like the ringing of a bell. This form of inspiration is the hardest of them all and then it passes off after I have grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says."''&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

At times, it was also reported that the experience was painful for Muhammad. For example, he had been heard saying, "Never once did I receive a revelation without thinking that my soul had been torn away from me."&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

After Muhammad would receive revelations, he would later recite it to his companions, who also memorized it or wrote it down. Before the Quran was commonly available in written form, speaking it from memory prevailed as the mode of teaching it to others. The practice of memorizing the whole Quran is still practiced among Muslims. Millions of people have memorized the entire Quran in Arabic. This fact, taken in the context of 7th-century Arabia, was not an extraordinary feat. People of that time had a penchant for recited poetry and had developed their skills in memorization to a remarkable degree. Events and competitions that featured the recitation of elaborate poetry were of great interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al Faruqi|first=Lois Ibsen|title=The Cantillation of the Qur'an|journal=Asian Music|year=1987|volume=19|issue=1|pages=3‚Äì4|doi=10.2307/833761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Muslim people questioned the nature and modes of Muhammad's revelations. The [[Meccan]]s interpreted the Quranic revelations based on their understanding of 'inspiration'. For them, poetry was closely connected to inspiration from a higher spiritual source. For this reason when Muhammad began preaching and reciting the Quran, the Meccans accused him of being a poet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|21|5|s=r|t=p}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a "poet possessed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|37|36|s=r|t=p}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-32639-7|pages=540‚Äì543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that the Quran was revealed in disjointed verses and chapters, a point came when it needed to be gathered into a coherent whole text. There are disagreements among both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars as to when the Quran was first compiled. A hadith in [[Sahih Bukhari]] states that the caliph Abu Bakr commanded [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] to compile  the [[Mus'haf|written Quran]], relying upon both textual fragments and the memories of those who had [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorized]] it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Qur'ƒÅn|publisher=Cambridge|editor=Jane Dammen MacAuliffe|page=145-155|last1=Leemhuis|first1=Fred|year=2006|isbn=9780521539340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/bukhari/93/53|publisher=Sunnah.com|access-date=14 October 2018|title=Sahih Bukhari, Book of Judgements}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Shia Muslims believe that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] was the first to compile the Quran into one written text, a task completed shortly after the death of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia |editor=Cenap √áakmak|page=11116-1120|year=2017|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610692175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muhammad===
The society during the time of [[Muhammad]] was predominantly oral and for this reason he would recite the Quranic verses to his Companions for them to memorize. Therefore, it is unknown whether the Quran was ever written and collected during the time of Muhammad. While writing was not a common skill during Muhammad's time, Mecca, being a commercial center, had a number of people who could write. Some scholars{{who|date=February 2018}} believe that up to 48 scribes including [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] and [[Ubay ibn Ka'b]] recorded verses of the Quran. This provides an explanation as to how the Quran existed in written form during the life of Muhammad, even if it was not compiled into one text.&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|83}}

[[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] scholars generally believe that the Quran was written down in its entirety at the time of Muhammad's death.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Muhammad's cousin [[Ibn Abbas]] describes the way in which the final version of the Quran was fixed: "the prophet recited the book before Gabriel every year in the month of Ramadan, and in the month in which he died he recited it before him twice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rippin|first=Andrew|title=The Blackwell Companion to the Qur'an|year=2009|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=978-1-4051-8820-3|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the term "reciting the Quran twice" means compiling all the Quranic revelations into a complete and final version. It is understood{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} that toward the end of Muhammad's life a special act of revelation occurred in which a final and complete version of the Quran was created. The term 'recite', which is used here, is referring to the custom where a Quranic scholar recites the entire Quran from beginning to end a number of times before a senior scholar. According to this tradition the act of recital is being performed by Muhammad, with angel Gabriel playing the role of superior authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rippin|first=Andrew|title=The Blackwell Companion to the Qur'an|year=2009|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=978-1-4051-8820-3|pages=165‚Äì166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the hadith Muhammad supposedly said, "I leave among you two things of high estimation: the Book of God and my Family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ibn al-Hajjaj|first=Muslim|title=Sahih Muslim, Book 31, #5920|url=http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/031-smt.php#031.5920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that this provides evidence that the Quran had been collected and written during this time because it is not correct to call something ''al-kitab'' (book) when it is merely in the [people's] memories. The word ''al-kitab'' signifies a single and united entity and does not apply to a text which is scattered and not collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena to the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument some Shia and Sunni scholars{{who|date=February 2018}} bring up is the importance that Muhammad attached to the Quran. They{{who|date=February 2018}} believe that since Muhammad put so much importance to the Quran he had to have ordered the writing of it during his lifetime. For example, Zayd ibn Thabit reported, "We used to record the Quran from parchments in the presence of the Messenger of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena to the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors{{who|date=February 2018}} believe that, as long as Muhammad was alive, there was always the expectation of further revelation as well as occasional abrogations. Any formal collection of the material already revealed could not properly be considered a complete text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Modarressi|first=Hossein|title=Early Debates on the Integrity of the Qur'an: A Brief Survey|journal=Studia Islamica|year=1993|volume=77|page=8|doi=10.2307/1595789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ali ibn Abu Talib===
{{Ali}}
Shia scholars are unanimous{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} that [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]] possessed a personal transcript of the Quran, which he collected six months after Muhammad's death, and that this was the first compilation of the Quran. The unique aspect about this version is that it was collected in the order it was sent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-32639-7|pages=30‚Äì31|chapter=Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt; which mainstream Shi'ism hold is the only difference between the Quran we have today and Ali's.&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|89‚Äì90}}

A few Shia scholars argue that Ali presented his Quran to the community, but they refused to acknowledge his copy. One report states, "he had brought the complete Book [of God], comprising the interpretation and the revelation, the precise and ambiguous verses, the abrogating and the abrogated verses; nothing was missing from it, [not even] a letter ''alif'', nor ''lam''. But they did not accept it from him"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena to the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe that Ali's version of the Quran contained verses that are not seen in the Uthmanic codex we have today. They believe changes in the order of verses and suras did take place and that there were variant readings, ''tabdil'', exchange of words such as ''umma'' to ''imma'', rearrangement of words and deletion of words pertaining to the right of Ali being the first caliph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-32639-7|pages=30‚Äì31|chapter=Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary Shia scholar [[Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei]] provides a counter argument to this belief. He states that even if Ali's Quran incorporated additions that are not part of the existing Quran, this does not mean that these additions comprised parts of the Quran and have been dropped from it due to alteration. Rather, these additions were interpretations or explanations of what God was saying, or were in the form of revelations from God, explaining the intention of the verses in the Quran. These additions were not part of the Quran and not part of what the Messenger of God was commanded to convey to the Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena to the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|pages=154‚Äì155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abu Bakr===
According to Sunni scholars, during the life of Muhammad parts of the Quran, though written, were scattered among his [[Sahaba|companions]], much of it as private possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/TheBiographyOfAbuBakrAsSiddeeq/TheBiographyOfAbuBakrAs-siddeeq#page/n505/mode/2up|title=The Biography of Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq|publisher=Archive.org|accessdate=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of Scribes was 43 companions. And there were many people who though were not scribes also were complete memorizers. After Muhammad's death, [[Abu Bakr]] initially exercised a policy of ''laissez faire'' as well. This policy was reversed after the [[Battle of Yamama]] in 633.&lt;ref name="sunnah.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/93/53|title=Hadith - Book of Judgments (Ahkaam) - Sahih al-Bukhari - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (ÿµŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿπŸÑŸäŸá Ÿà ÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ)|publisher=Sunnah.com|date=2012-04-26|accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Usmani1&gt;{{cite book|last=Usmani|first=Mohammad Taqi|editor=Abdur Rehman, Rafiq|translator=Siddiqui, Mohammed Swaleh|title=An approach to the Quranic sciences|publisher=Darul Ish'at|year=2000|location=Birmingham|pages=191‚Äì6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the battle, 700 [[Hafiz (Quran)|Muslims who had memorized the Quran]] were killed. The death of Salim, however, was most significant, as he was one of the very few who had been entrusted by [[Muhammad]] to teach the Quran. Consequently, upon [[Umar]]'s insistence, Abu Bakr ordered the collection of the hitherto scattered pieces of the Quran into one copy.&lt;ref name="sunnah.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=collection&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasan|first=Sayyid Siddiq|author2=Nadwi, Abul Hasan Ali|translator=Kidwai, A.R.|title=The collection of the Qur'an|publisher=Qur'anic Arabic Foundation|year=2000|location=Karachi|pages=34‚Äì5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zayd ibn Thabit]], Muhammad's primary scribe, was assigned the duty of gathering all of the Quranic text. He gives an insight into what happened during the meeting between Abu Bakr, Umar, and himself:

:''" Abu Bakr sent for me at a time when the Yamama battles had witnessed the martyrdom of numerous Companions. I found 'Umar bin al-Khattab with him. Abu Bakr began,''' '''Umar has just come to me and said, 'In the Yamama battles death has dealt most severely with the qurra',[Reciters of the Quran] and I fear it will deal with them with equal severity in other theatres of war. As a result much of the Quran will be gone. " 'I am therefore of the opinion that you should command the Quran be collected.'" Abu Bakr continued, "I said to 'Umar, 'How can we embark on what the Prophet never did?' 'Umar replied that it was a good deed regardless, and he did not cease replying to my scruples until Allah reconciled me to the undertaking, and I became of the same mind as him. Zaid, you are young and intelligent, you used to record the revelations for Muhammad, and we know nothing to your discredit. So pursue the Quran and collect it together." By Allah, had they asked me to move a mountain it could not have been weightier than what they requested of me now". (Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Jam'i al-Qur'an, hadith no. 4986; see also Ibn Abu Dawud, al-Masahif, pp. 6-9)

His reaction to the task and its difficulties are further explained:

:''"...By Allah, if he (Abu Bakr) had ordered me to shift one of the mountains it would not have been harder for me than what he had ordered me concerning the collection of the Quran... So I started locating the Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leafstalks of date palms and from the memories of men.{{sup|[Bukhari {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|6|60|201}}]}}

Al-Zarakhsi comments,&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami1"/&gt;

:What Zaid means in fact is that he sought out verses from scattered sources, to collate them against the recollections of the ''huffaz''. In this way everyone participated in the collection process. No one possessing any portion of it was left out, and so no one had reason for expressing concern about the verses collected, nor could anyone complain that the text had been gathered from only a select few.&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami1"/&gt;

Zayd also said:
:''"So I started looking for the Holy quran and collected it from (what was written on) palm-leaf stalks, thin white stones, and also from men who knew it by heart, until I found the last verse of Surat at-Tauba (repentance) with Abi Khuzaima al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 6, p. 478).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//archive.org/stream/TheBiographyOfAbuBakrAsSiddeeq/TheBiographyOfAbuBakrAs-siddeeq#page/n507/mode/2up|title=The Biography of Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq|publisher=Archive.org|accessdate=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] draws special attention to Zayd's statement, "I found two verses of Sura al-Bara'a with Abu Khuzaima al-Ansari," as demonstrating that Zayd's own writings and memorisation were not deemed sufficient. Everything required verification.&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami1"&gt;[[Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami]] (2003), ''The History of The Qur'anic Text: From Revelation to Compilation: A Comparative Study with the Old and New Testaments'', p.83. UK Islamic Academy. {{ISBN|978-1872531656}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Hajar further comments:
:Abu Bakr had not authorised him to record except what was already available [on parchment]. That is why Zaid refrained from including the final ayah of Sura Bara'a until he came upon it in written form, even though he and his fellow Companions could recall it perfectly well from memory.&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami1"/&gt;

The task required Zayd ibn Thabit to collect written copies of the Quran, with each verse having been validated with the oral testimony of at least two companions. The Quran was collected under the auspices of committee of four senior ranking Companions headed by Zayd ibn Thabit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/66/26|title=Hadith - Book of Virtues of the Qur'an - Sahih al-Bukhari - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (ÿµŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿπŸÑŸäŸá Ÿà ÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ)|publisher=Sunnah.com|date=2012-04-26|accessdate=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compilation was kept by the Caliph Abu Bakr, after his death by his successor, Caliph [[Umar]], who on his deathbed gave them to [[Hafsa bint Umar]], his daughter and one of Muhammad's widows.&lt;ref name="Usmani1"/&gt;

It should be noted that Sunnis dismiss the Shia version of the Quranic compilation as nothing more than Twelver Shia fabrications. They point to the fact that Zaydi Shias who form the oldest living Shia sect believe in the above events described in Sahih Bukhari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQICAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Religion+and+Mysticism+in+Early+Islam:+Theology+and+Sufism+in+Yemen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ypk8VYWjBsXXPcmDgdAJ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sunna&amp;f=false|title=Religion and Mysticism in Early Islam: Theology and Sufism in Yemen|author=Muhammad Ali Aziz|publisher=Google Books|date=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uthman ibn Affan and the canonization===
{{Uthman}}
The Quranic canon is the form of the Quran as recited and written in which it is religiously binding for the Muslim community. This canonical corpus is closed and fixed in the sense that nothing in the Quran can be changed or modified. The process of canonization ended under the third caliph, [[Uthman ibn Affan]] (r. 23/644‚Äì35/655), which was about twenty years after the death of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 136‚Äì139"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-32639-7|pages=136‚Äì139|chapter=Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of Uthman's caliphate, there was a perceived need for clarification of Quran reading. The Caliphate had grown considerably, expanding into Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and Iran, bringing into Islam's fold many new converts from various cultures with varying degrees of isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari: The Conquest of Iraq, Southwestern Persia, and Egypt|year=1989|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0-88706-876-6|pages=2‚Äì6|others=Gautier H. A. Juynboll (trans.)|editor1=Ihsan Abbas|editor2=C. E. Bosworth|editor3=Jacob Lassner|editor4=Franz Rosenthal|editor5=Ehsan Yar-Shater}}&lt;/ref&gt; These converts spoke a variety of languages but were not well learned in Arabic, and so Uthman felt it was important to standardize the written text of the Quran into one specific Arabic dialect. Another reason for compiling the Quran was that many Muslims who had memorised the Quran in its entirety (''[[Hafiz (Quran)|huffaz]]'') were dying, especially in battle.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

According to the dominant version narrated by [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]], the reason for the final collection of the Quran was a dispute between Muslim forces from Iraq and Syria over the correct way of reciting it during communal prayers while on an expedition to Armenia and Azerbaijan.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

It is believed that the general [[Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman]] reported this problem to the caliph and asked him to establish a unified text. According to the history of [[al-Tabari]], during the expedition there were 10,000 Kufan warriors, 6,000 in Azerbaijan and 4,000 at Rayy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari: The Crisis of the Early Caliphate|year=1990|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0-7914-0154-5|page=8|others=Stephen Humphreys (trans.)|editor1=Ihsan Abbas |editor2=C. E. Bosworth|editor3=Franz Rosenthal|editor4=Ehsan Yar-Sharter}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of soldiers disagreeing about the correct way of reciting the Quran may have caused Hudhayfah to promote a unified text. An example of the confusion at this time is seen during a campaign in Tabaristan, where one of the soldiers asked, Hudhayfah "How did the Messenger of God pray?" Hudhayfah told him the soldier prayed before fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari: The Crisis of the Early Caliphate|year=1990|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0-7914-0154-5|page=42|others=R. Humphreys (trans.)|editor1=Ihsan Abbas |editor2=C. E. Bosworth |editor3=Franz Rosenthal|editor4=Ehsan Yar-Sharter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed upon Hudhayfah's request Uthman obtained the sheets of the Quran from ·∏§af·π£a and appointed a commission consisting of Zayd and three prominent Meccans, and instructed them to copy the sheets into several volumes based on the dialect of Quraysh, the main tribe of Mecca.&lt;ref name="al-Kur'an"/&gt;

Uthman's reaction in 653 is recorded in the following:
:''"So Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, "Send us the manuscripts of the Quran so that we may compile the Quranic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you." Hafsa sent it to Uthman. Uthman then ordered [[Zaid bin Thabit]], Abdullah bin Az Zubair, [[Sa'id ibn al-'As|Said bin Al-As]] and Abdur Rahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, "In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Quran, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Quran was revealed in their tongue." They did so, and when they had written many copies, 'Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. 'Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Quranic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt. Zayd bin Thabit added, "A Verse from Surat Ahzab was missed by me when we copied the Quran and I used to hear Allah's Apostle reciting it. So we searched for it and found it with Khuzaima bin Thabit Al-Ansari. [That verse was]: 'Among the Believers are men who have been true in their covenant with Allah.'"{{Quran-usc|33|23}}{{sup|[Bukhari {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|6|61|510}}]}}''

When the task was finished Uthman kept one copy in Medina and sent others to Kufa, Ba·π£ra, Damascus, and, according to some accounts, Mecca, and ordered that all other variant copies of the Quran to be destroyed. This was done everywhere except in Kufa, where some scholars argue that, Ibn Mas ø≈´d and his followers refused.&lt;ref name="al-Kur'an"&gt;{{cite journal|title=al-Kur'an|journal=Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition|year=2012|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-kuran-COM_0543|editors=Bearman, Bianquis, Bosworth, van Donzel, Heinrichs|publisher=Brill Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important that the compilation of the Quran during the time of Caliph Abu Bakr which was inherited by Caliph Umar's daughter Hafsa (and a wife of Muhammad) was not destroyed but was passed back to her. This would imply that the first compilation, during the time of Abu Bakr, was not at variation with the Uthmanic compilation.

It is generally accepted that the Uthmanic text comprises all 114 suras in the order known today.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 136‚Äì139"/&gt;

According to Ayatollah Khu'i there is no doubt that Uthman collected the Quran during his time, but not in the sense that he collected the verses and suras in one volume, but in the sense that he united the Muslims on the reading of one authoritative recension. He also argues that the one reading on which Uthman united the Muslims was the one in circulation among most Muslims, and that it reached them through uninterrupted transmission from Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena to the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is one of the most contested issues and an area where many non-Muslim and Muslim scholars often clash.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 136‚Äì139"/&gt;

==Origin according to academic historians==
The origin of the Quran has been a subject of sustained academic research.&lt;ref name=OB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Andrew Rippin|title=Qur'an|encyclopedia=Oxford Bibliographies|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195390155/obo-9780195390155-0066.xml|subscription=yes|quote= How the Qur æan came into being and why it looks the way it does has proven to be a continual focus of attention for scholarship. Most accounts accept the basic framework of the Muslim memory, with the role of Muhammad as the recipient of revelation and the role subsequent caliphs in bringing the text together clearly separated. Some scholarship has wanted to challenge the originality and source of the text itself, tracing it to other religious communities (especially Christian: L√ºling 2003; Luxenberg 2007). Others have tried to refine the Muslim accounts of revelation and collection.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars accept the basic outlines of the traditional account, which separates Muhammad's role as the recipient of revelation from the role played by the early caliphs in compiling the text.&lt;ref name=OB/&gt; There have also been a number of proposals for refinement of the traditional view and even its fundamental reevaluation.&lt;ref name=OB/&gt; [[Fred Donner]] summarized the state of the field as of 2008 in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Donner|title=The Qur'an in Recent Scholarship|volume=The Quran in its historical context|editor=Gabriel Said Reynolds|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Qur'anic studies, as a field of academic research, appears today to be in a state of disarray. Those of us who study Islam's origins have to admit collectively that we simply do not know some very basic things about the Qur'an ‚Äì things so basic that the knowledge of them is usually taken for granted by scholars dealing with other texts. They include such questions as: How did the Qur'an originate? Where did it come from, and when did it first appear? How was it first written? In what kind of language was ‚Äì is ‚Äì it written? What form did it first take? Who constituted its first audience? How was it transmitted from one generation to another, especially in its early years? When, how, and by whom was it codified? Those familiar with the Qur'an and the scholarship on it will know that to ask even one of these questions immediately plunges us into realms of grave uncertainty and has the potential to spark intense debate. To put it another way, on these basic issues there is little consensus even among the well-trained scholars who work on them.}}

Some scholars, such as [[John Wansbrough]], [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]], and [[Patricia Crone]], have been unwilling to attribute the entire Quran to Muhammad (or Uthman), arguing that there "is no hard evidence for the existence of the Quran in any form before the last decade of the 7th century...[and that]...the tradition which places this rather opaque revelation in its historical context is not attested before the middle of the eighth." "There is no proof that the text of the Quran was collected under Uthman, since the earliest surviving copies of the complete Quran are centuries later than Uthman. (The oldest existing copy of the full text is from the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World'', Crone, Patricia &amp; Cook, Michael, p. 3 Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;) They contend that Islam was formed gradually over a number of centuries after the Muslim conquests, as the Islamic conquerors elaborated their beliefs in response to Jewish and Christian challenges.&lt;ref&gt;P.

It is claimed that such scholars have been proven wrong by subsequent scientific evidence, including carbon dating of early manuscripts of the Quran. "The opening chapters of Fred Donner's ''Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing'' claims to refute the theoretical and methodological flaws of the skeptical school and instead dates the composition of the Quran, as a closed canon, to an Arabian context of early believers preceding ... the first civil war in 656."&lt;ref&gt;Emran El- Badawi "Sectarian Scripture: The Quran's Dogmatic Re-articulation of the Aramaic Gospel Tradition in the Late Antique Near East"  Research Dissertation University of Chicago., p 16&lt;/ref&gt; Donner's perspective now represents mainstream scholarly opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Emran El- Badawi "Sectarian Scripture: The Quran's Dogmatic Re-articulation of the Aramaic Gospel Tradition in the Late Antique Near East"  Research Dissertation University of Chicago., p 17&lt;/ref&gt; The findings in 2015 of the Birmingham Manuscripts lead Joseph E.

[[File:Temple Mount.JPG|thumb|Dome of the Rock. The structure, the oldest extant example of early Islamic architecture, was completed in 691 AD]]
The [[Dome of the Rock]] with its inscriptions are interesting in the dating of the text.&lt;ref name="Estelle Whelan 1988, pp. 1-14"&gt;Estelle Whelan, ''Forgotten Witness: Evidence For The Early Codification Of The Qur'an'', 1988, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 1998, Volume 118, pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; These inscriptions have been known to scholars for more than a century and have repeatedly been the subject of interpretation, yet little attention has been paid to the elements from which they were composed. On the inner face of the octagon the declaration of faith is followed by conflated verses describing the powers of God. Next Muhammad is introduced, with a blessing that, though not directly quoted from the Quran, was clearly already in use in 694 AD. Then comes an exhortation to Christians that Jesus was also a prophet and mortal, followed by the claim that God is sufficient unto Himself. Finally comes a command to bend to His will and the threat of reckoning for those who do not.&lt;ref name="Estelle Whelan 1988, pp. 1-14"/&gt;

Wansbrough wrote in a dense, complex, almost hermetic style,&lt;ref name="Estelle Whelan 1988, pp. 1-14"/&gt; and has had much more influence on Islamic studies through his students than he has through his own writings.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} His students Crone and Cook co-authored a book called ''[[Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World]]'' (1977), which was extremely controversial at the time as it challenged not only Muslim orthodoxy, but the prevailing attitudes among secular Islamic scholars.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Crone, Wansbrough, and Nevo argue that all the primary sources which exist are from 150&amp;ndash;300 years after the events which they describe, and thus are chronologically far removed from those events.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yehuda D. Nevo]] "Towards a Prehistory of Islam," Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam, vol.17, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1994 p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Wansbrough]] The Sectarian Milieu: Content and Composition of Islamic Salvation History, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1978 p,119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia Crone]], ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam,'' Princeton University Press, 1987 p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of contemporaneous corroborating material from the very first century of Islam has raised numerous questions as to the authenticity of the account provided by later traditionalist sources. All that is preserved from this time period are a few commemorative building inscriptions and assorted coins.&lt;ref name="gazellebookservices.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazellebookservices.co.uk/ISBN/1591026342.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905011505/http://www.gazellebookservices.co.uk/ISBN/1591026342.htm |archivedate=September 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars deny such a belittlement of key sources from the era. Besides the Dome of the Rock inscriptions mentioned above, there are also brief Quranic passages on coins issued from the time of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] from the period 697-750. These passages include, in addition to the shahadah, verses 112:1-3 (or 4) complete (except for the initial ''basmallah'' and the introductory word "say"), and part of 9:33, but with some variations: "He sent him with the guidance and the Religion of Truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion". In parallel to the contemporary inscriptions at the Dome of the Rock these extracts are clearly intended to declare the primacy of the new religion of Islam over Christianity, in particular.&lt;ref name="Estelle Whelan 1988, pp. 1-14"/&gt;

Skeptical scholars, nonetheless, point out that the earliest account of Muhammad's life by [[Ibn Ishaq]] was written about a century after Muhammad died and all later narratives by Islamic biographers contain far more details and embellishments about events which are entirely lacking in Ibn Ishaq's text.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone, [[Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam]], pp. 203-30, where she argues that much of the classical Muslim understanding of the Koran rests on the work of storytellers and that this work is of very dubious historical value. These storytellers contributed to the tradition on the rise of Islam, and this is evident in the steady growth of information: "If one storyteller should happen to mention a raid, the next storyteller would know the date of this raid, while the third would know everything that an audience might wish to hear about it." 53 Then, comparing the accounts of the raid of Kharrar by Ibn Ishaq and al-Waqidi, Crone shows that al-Waqidi, influenced by and in the manner of the storytellers, "will always give precise dates, locations, names, where Ibn Ishaq has none, accounts of what triggered the expedition, miscellaneous information to lend color to the event, as well as reasons why, as was usually the case, no fighting took place."&lt;/ref&gt;

Patricia Crone, studying the origins of the Quran, has focused on the examination of the vast body of the [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Hebrew]], [[Aramaic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] accounts of non-Muslim neighbors of the 7th and 8th centuries which in many cases contradict the traditional Islamic narratives. She argues that the consistency of the non-Muslim sources spread over a large geographic area would tend to rule out a non-Muslim anti-Islamic motive to these sources.&lt;ref name=Crone15&gt;[[Patricia Crone]], ''Slaves on Horses'', pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The skeptic approach has been further expanded by [[Christoph Luxenberg]], who supports claims for a late composition of the Quran, and traces much of it to [[The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran|sources other than Muhammad]]. Luxenberg is known for his thesis that the Quran is merely a re-working of an earlier Christian text, a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[lectionary]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Syro-Aramaic Reading Of The Qur'an'', 2007 English edition&lt;/ref&gt; (See also the articles [[Gerd R. Puin]], and [[Alexander the Great in the Quran]].)

[[Fred Donner]] has argued for an early date for the collection of the Quran, based on his reading of the text itself. He points out that if the Quran had been collected over the tumultuous early centuries of Islam, with their vast conquests and expansion and bloody incidents between rivals for the caliphate, there would have been some evidence of this history in the text. However, there is nothing in the Quran that does not reflect what is known of the earliest Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;''Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing'', Donner, Darwin Press, 1998, p. 60, {{ISBN|0-87850-127-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, during the restoration of the Great Mosque of [[San'a]] in [[Yemen]], laborers stumbled upon a "paper grave" containing tens of thousands of fragments of parchment on which verses of the Quran were written. Some of these fragments were believed to be the oldest Quranic texts yet found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=What Is the Quran?|first=Toby|last=Lester|journal=The Atlantic|date=January 1999|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest in origin of the Quran is the discovery of parchments of the Quranic text discovered by University of Birmingham, the parchment (the material) has been radiocarbon dated to the period between AD 568 and 645 with 95.4% accuracy. The test was carried out in a laboratory at the University of Oxford. The result places the parchment close to the time of Muhammad, who is generally thought to have lived between AD 570 and 632. Researchers conclude that the parchment is among the earliest written textual evidence of the Quran in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Press Office|first=University of Birmingham|date=22 July 2015|title=Birmingham Qur'an manuscript dated among the oldest in the world|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2015/07/quran-manuscript-22-07-15.aspx|work=University of Birmingham Press Office|location=Birmingham, England|access-date=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarities to the Bible===
{{Main|Biblical narratives and the Quran}}
Skeptical scholars account for the many similarities between the Quran and the Jewish and Hebrew Scriptures by saying that Muhammad was teaching what he believed to be a universal history, as he had heard it from the Jews and Christians he had encountered in Arabia and on his travels - as well as his exposure to the [[Hanif]] tradition by way of his paternal-grandfather, [[Abdul Muttalib]]. These scholars also disagree with the Islamic belief that the whole of the Quran is addressed by God to humankind. They note that there are numerous passages where God is directly addressed, or mentioned in the third person, or where the narrator swears by various entities, including God.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to the Qur'an'' 2nd Edition, Richard Bell, W. Montgomery Watt, Edinburgh University Press, 1970, {{ISBN|0-7486-0597-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7486-0597-2}} p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varying codices and the start of the canonization==
Before Uthman established the canon of the Quran, there may have been different versions or codices in complete state, though none has yet been discovered. Such codices as may exist never gained general approval and were viewed by Muslims as individuals' personal copies.&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|93}} With respect to partial codices, there is opinion that "the search for variants in the partial versions extant before the Caliph Uthman's alleged recension in the 640s has not yielded any differences of great significance".&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters, The Quest of the Historical Muhammad, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 23, No. 3 (Aug.,1991), p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; The two most influential codices at this time are  ø[[Abdullah ibn Mas'ud|Abdullah ibn Mas øud]]s and [[Ubayy ibn Kab|Ubayy ibn Ka øb]]'s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Al-Qurazi recounted seeing the ''mushafs'' used by Ibn Mas'ud, Ubayy, and Zaid b. Thabit and finding no differences between them.&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami5"&gt;[[Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami]] (2003), ''The History of The Qur'anic Text: From Revelation to Compilation: A Comparative Study with the Old and New Testaments'', p.197. UK Islamic Academy. {{ISBN|978-1872531656}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== øAbdullah ibn Mas øud's codex===
The most influential of the allegedly varying codices was that of  ø[[Abdullah ibn Masud|Abdullah ibn Mas øud]], an early convert who became a personal servant to [[Muhammad]]. It is reported that he learned around seventy suras directly from Muhammad, who appointed him as one of the first teachers of Quranic recitation. Later he was appointed to an administrative post in Kufa by the caliph  øUmar, where he became a leading authority on the Quran and hadith. Some sources suggest that Ibn Mas øud refused to destroy his copy of the Quran or to stop teaching it when the  øUthmanic codex was made official.&lt;ref name="al-Kur'an"/&gt;

There are two points on which Ibn Mas øud's version is alleged to differ from the  øUthmanic text: the order of the suras and some variants in the readings. [[Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami]] lists three reports concerning the omission of three suras, ([[Al-Fatiha]] and [[Al-Mu'awwidhatayn]], the two short suras with which the Quran ends (Suras 113 and 114)), he then states that "early scholars such as [[al-Nawawi]] and [[Ibn Hazm]] denounced these reports as lies fathered upon Ibn Mas'ud."&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami6"&gt;[[Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami]] (2003), ''The History of The Qur'anic Text: From Revelation to Compilation: A Comparative Study with the Old and New Testaments'', pp.199-201. UK Islamic Academy. {{ISBN|978-1872531656}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the other differences involve only altered vowels with the same consonantal text, which caused variations in recitation.&lt;ref name="al-Kur'an"/&gt;

===Ubay ibn Ka'b's codex===
The second most influential codex was that of [[Ubay ibn Ka'b]], a Medinan Muslim who served as a secretary for Muhammad. It is believed that he may have been more prominent as a Quranic specialist than Ibn Mas øud during Mu·∏•ammad's lifetime. There are reports that he was responsible for memorizing certain important revelations on legal matters, which from time to time Muhammad asked him to recite. In a few ''hadiths'', Ubay is seen in a variety of roles. For instance, the "sheets" of Ubay are sometimes mentioned in some instances instead of those of ·∏§afsa, and sometimes he is also mentioned in some ''hadiths'' instead of Zayd, dictating the Quran to scribes.

His version of the Quran is said to have included two short suras not in the Uthmanic or Ibn Mas øud texts: ''S≈´rat al-Khal'', with three verses, and ''S≈´rat al-·∏§afd'', with six. The order of suras in Ubayy's codex is said to have differed from that of Uthman's and Ibn Mas øud's as well,&lt;ref name="al-Kur'an"/&gt; although these are structural differences rather than textual variations.

The first sura, entitled ''al-Khal'' ("separation"), is translated as: "O Allah, we seek your help and ask your forgiveness, and we praise you and we do not disbelieve in you. We separate from and leave him who sins against you."

The second sura, entitled ''al-Hafd'' ("haste"), is translated as: "O Allah, we worship You and to You we pray and prostrate and to You we run and hasten to serve You. We hope for Your mercy and we fear Your punishment. Your punishment will certainly reach the disbelievers." These two pieces are said to constitute ''qunut'' (that is, supplications which Muhammad sometimes made in morning prayer or in ''witr'' prayer after recitation of suras from the Quran). They are in fact identical to some parts of ''qunut'' reported in the collections of ''hadiths''. (See Nawawi, ''al-adhkar'', Cairo, 1955, pp. 57‚Äì58.)

The single additional so-called ''aya'' is translated: "If the son of Adam were given a valley full of riches, he would wish a second one; and if he were given two valleys full of riches, he would surely ask for a third. Nothing will fill the belly of the son of Adam except dust, and Allah is forgiving to him who is repentant." This text is known to be a ''[[hadith]]'' from Muhammad. (Bukhari, VIII, No. 444-47.) According to Ibn 'Abbas (No. 445) and 'Ubay (No. 446) this text was at times thought to be part of the Quran. However, Ubay himself clarifies that after sura 102: "I had been revealed, [the sahaba] did not consider the above to be part of the Quran." (Bukhari, VIII, No. 446.)

This explanation of Ubay also makes it very clear that the companions of Mohammad did not differ at all about what was part of the Quran and what was not part of the Quran when the revelation had ceased. It is also important to note that the ''hadith'' appeared in the ''mushaf'' of Ubay because it was for his own personal use; that is, in his private notebook, where he did not always distinguish between Quranic material and ''hadith'', since the notebook was not meant for public use and he himself knew well what to make of his own notes. All companions of Mohammad are said to have had their own copies of the Quran, with notes, for personal use.

The Islamic reports of these copies of the Quran of the companions of Mohammad only tell of various differences according to reports that reached them (''e.g.'', the ''hadith'' in Bukhari, VIII, No. 446, that Ubay at some early stage held this sentence to be part of the Quran). However, the tangible manuscripts of these copies of the Quran have not survived but were destroyed, having been considered obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamicbulletin.org/free_downloads/quran/ul_umal_quran.pdf|format=PDF|title=An Introduction to the Sciences of the Qur'an |author=Ahmad von Denffer |publisher=Islamicbulletin.org|accessdate=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early manuscripts to the final canonical text==
{{Further|Early Quranic manuscripts}}
After Uthman had the other codices destroyed there were still variations in the reading and the text of this Quran. However, scholars deny the possibility of great changes of the text arguing that addition, suppression or alteration would have led to controversy 'of which there is little trace'. They further state that even though Uthman became unpopular among Muslims, he was not charged with alteration or mutilation of the Quran in general.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to the Qur'an'', Richard Bell, W. Montgomery Watt, Edinburgh University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|978-0748605972}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the manuscript age, the Quran was the most copied Arabic text. It was believed that copying the Quran would bring blessings on the scribe and the owner.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384‚Äì389"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-32639-7|pages=384‚Äì389|chapter=Manuscript and the Qur'an}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic script as we know it today was unknown in Muhammad's time (as Arabic writing styles have progressed through time) and the Quran was preserved through memorization and written references on different materials. As Arab society started to evolve into using writing more regularly, writing skills evolved accordingly. Early Quranic Arabic lacked precision because distinguishing between consonants was impossible due to the absence of diacritical marks (''a'jam''). Vowelling marks (''tashkil'') to indicate prolongation or vowels were absent as well. Due to this there were endless possibilities for the mispronunciation of the word. The Arabic script as we know it today, the ''scripta plena'', which has pointed texts and is fully vowelled was not perfected until the middle of the 9th century.&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|92}}

===Umayyad Period (44/661‚Äì132/750) ‚Äì Hijazi script===
The earliest known manuscripts of the Quran are collectively called the Hijazi script, and are mostly associated with the Umayyad period.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384‚Äì389"/&gt;

Most of the fundamental reform to the manuscripts of the Quran took place under [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]], the fifth Umayyad caliph (65/685‚Äì86/705).&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384‚Äì389"/&gt; Under Abd al-Malik's reign, Abu'l Aswad al-Du'ali (died 688) founded the Arabic grammar and invented the system of placing large colored dots to indicate the tashkil. The Umayyad governor [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf Al-Thaqafi|al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi]] later enforced this system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-32639-7|page=131|chapter=Calligraphy and the Qur'an}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time the construction of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem in 72/691‚Äì92 was done, which was complete with Quranic inscriptions. The inscriptions on the Dome of the Rock in fact represent the earliest known dated passages from the Quran. In these inscriptions, many letters are already provided with diacritical points.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384‚Äì389"/&gt;

The earliest codices of the Quran found in the Umayyad period were most likely made in single volumes, which can be determined from the large fragments that have survived. Also during this time, the format of the codex went from being vertical to horizontal in the 8th century. It is believed this change to horizontal formats and thick/heavy-looking scripts may have been done to show the superiority of the Quran and to distinguish the Islamic tradition from the Jewish and Christian ones, who used vertical formats for their scriptures.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384‚Äì389"/&gt;

During this time, there was a diversity of styles in which the Quran was written. One characteristic seen in most of these manuscripts is the elongated shafts of the free-standing alif and the right-sided tail (foot) of the isolated alif. Also, these manuscripts do not have headings of chapters (suras). Instead, a blank space is left at the end of one sura and at the beginning of another.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384‚Äì389"/&gt;

===Abbasid Period (132/750‚Äì640/1258)===

====Early Abbasid Style====
Unlike the manuscripts from the Umayyad Dynasty, many of the early Abbasid manuscripts were copied in a number of volumes. This is evident from the large scripts used and the smaller number of lines per page.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Early Quranic manuscripts provide evidence for the history of the Quranic text and their formal features tell us something about the way art and its deeper meaning were perceived in the classical age of Islam. Both its script and layout turned out to be constructed according to elaborate geometrical and proportional rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Geometry of early Qur'anic Manuscripts|author=Alan George|journal=Journal of Qur'anic Studies|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|volume=9|issue=1|year=2007|pages=78‚Äì110|jstor=25728237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main characteristic of these scripts was their writing style. The letters in most of these manuscripts are heavy-looking, relatively short and horizontally elongated. The slanted isolated form of the alif that was present in the Umayyad period completely disappeared and was replaced by a straight shaft with a pronounced right-sided foot, set at a considerable distance from the following letter. Also, unlike the Hijazi scripts, these are often richly illuminated in gold and other colors. Another difference is that sura headings are clearly marked and enclosed in rectangular panels with marginal vignettes or palmettes protruding into the outer margins. These Qurans of the early Abbasid period were also bound in wooden boards, structured like a box enclosed on all sides with a movable upper cover that was fastened to the rest of the structure with leather thongs.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384‚Äì389"/&gt;

====New Abbasid Style====
The New Abbasid Style (NS) began at the end of the 9th century C.E. and was used for copying the Quran until the 12th centuries, and maybe even as late as the 13th century. Unlike manuscripts copied in Early Abbasid scripts, NS manuscripts had vertical formats.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 384‚Äì389"/&gt;

During this time, [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi]] (died 786) devised a tashkil system to replace that of Abu al-Aswad. His system has been universally used since the early 11th century, and includes six diacritical marks: fatha (a), damma (u), kasra (i), sukun (vowel-less), shadda (double consonant), madda (vowel prolongation; applied to the alif).&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 130‚Äì131"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|title=The Qur'an: an Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-32639-7|pages=130‚Äì131|chapter=Calligraphy and the Qur'an}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another central figure during this time was [[Ibn MujƒÅhid|Abu Bakr b. MujƒÅhid]] (died 324/936). His goal was to restrict the number of reliable readings and accept only those based on a fairly uniform consonantal text. He chose seven well-known Quran teachers of the 2nd/8th century and declared that their readings all had divine authority, which the others lacked. He based this on the popular ·∏•adith in which Muhammad says the Quran was revealed to him in "[[Qira'at|seven a·∏•ruf]]". During this time there was strong Quranic traditions in Kufa, Ba·π£ra, Medina, Damascus, and Mecca. Due to this, Ibn MujƒÅhid selected one reading each for Medina, Mecca, Ba·π£ra, and Damascus‚Äîthose of Nafi ø (died 169/785), Ibn Kathir (died 120/737), Abu  øAmr (died 154/770), and Ibn øAmir (died 118/736), respectively‚Äîand three for K≈´fa, those of  øAsim (died 127/744), ·∏§amza (died 156/772), and al-Kisa æi (died 189/804). His attempt to limit the number of canonical readings to seven was not acceptable to all, and there was strong support for alternative readings in most of the five cities. In the present day the most common reading that is in general use is that of 'Aasim al-Kufi through Hafs.&lt;ref name="al-Kur'an"/&gt;

The 11th-century eastern Quranic manuscript contains the 20th juz' (section) of a Quran that originally consisted of 30 parts. The arrangement into 30 parts corresponds to the number of days in the month of Ramadan, during which the Muslim is obliged to fast and to read through the whole of the Quran. Other sections or fragments of this magnificent manuscript lie scattered in various collections all over the world. A Turkish note ascribes the Quran to the hand of the Caliph Ali, Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, and thus demonstrates the high significance of this manuscript. The text is written in Eastern Kufic, a monumental script that was developed in Iran in the late 10th century. The writing and the illumination of the manuscript bear witness to the great artistic skills of the calligrapher and the illustrator. The manuscript is at the Bavarian State Library in Munich, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8937/|title=11th Century Qur'an in Eastern Kufic|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of seven complete or nearly complete semi-Kufic Qurans from before the end of the eleventh century, four contain a verse count. Although admittedly a small sample, it does suggest that the use of a verse count was a prevalent and quite deeply rooted practice in semi-Kufic Qurans between ca. 950 and ca. 1100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yasser Tabbaa|title=The transformation of Arabic writing|journal=Ars Orientalis|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|volume=21|year=1991|pages=119‚Äì148|jstor=4629416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Muqla]] (died 940), an accomplished calligrapher from Baghdad, was also a prominent figure at this time. He became vizir to three Abbasid caliphs and is credited with developing the first script to obey strict proportional rules. Ibn Muqla's system was used in the development and standardization of the Quranic script, and his [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphic]] work became the standard way of writing the Quran.&lt;ref name="Leaman 2006 130‚Äì131"/&gt; However it was later perfected by Ibn al-Bawwab (d. 1022), the master calligrapher who continued Muqla's tradition. Muqla's system became one of the most popular styles for transcribing Arabic manuscripts in general, being favored for its legibility. The eleventh century Quran is one of the earliest dated manuscripts in this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/iraqiquran.html|title=11th Century Qur'an|accessdate=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This "new style" is defined by breaks and angular forms and by extreme contrasts between the thick and thin strokes. The script was initially used in administrative and legal documents, but then it replaced earlier Quranic scripts. It is possible that it was easier to read than the early 'Abbasid scripts, which differ greatly from current writing. Economic factors may also have played a part because while the "new style" was being introduced, paper was also beginning to spread throughout the Muslim world, and the decrease in the price of books triggered by the introduction of this new material seems to have led to an increase in its demand. The "new style" was the last script to spread throughout the Muslim world before the introduction of printing. It remained in use until the 13th century, at which point it was restricted to titles only.&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|177}}

==Completeness==

===Islamic sources===
Records from Islamic sources suggest that before Caliph Uthman's standardization, after which variants were allegedly burned, the Quran may have contained either 116 chapters (Ubayy Ibn Ka'ab's codex) or 111 chapters (Ibn Ma'sud's codex).&lt;ref&gt;As-Suyuti, "Al-Itqan", pp.&amp;nbsp;152-153; Arthur Jeffery, ''Materials for the History of the Text of the Qu'ran: The Old Codices''. Leiden: E.J.&amp;nbsp;Brill, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic View: Sunni and Shia===
Muslims believe that Quran, as it is presented today, is complete and untouched, supported by their faith in Quranic verses such as "We [i.e. Allah] have, without doubt, sent down the Reminder [i.e. the Quran]; and We will assuredly guard it [from corruption]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|15|9|t=p|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the varying accounts and hadiths on the collection and canonization of the Quran, some scholars debate whether the Uthmanic text contains the entire body of material that was revealed to Muhammad, or if there is material missing from the text. For example, some Sunni literature contains reports that suggest that some of the revelations had already been lost before the collection of the Quran initiated by Abu Bakr.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In one report, 'Umar was once looking for the text of a specific verse of the Quran on stoning as a punishment for adultery, which he remembered. Later, he discovered that the only person who had any record of that verse had been killed in the battle of Yamama and as a result the verse was lost. Some of the Companions recalled that same verse, one person being 'A'isha, Muhammad's youngest wife. She is believed to have said that a sheet on which two verses, including the one on stoning, were under her bedding and that after Muhammad died, a domestic animal got into the room and ate the sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Modarressi|first=Hossein|title=Early Debates on the Integrity of the Qur'an: A Brief Survey|journal=Studia Islamica|year=1993|volume=77|publisher=Maisonneuve and Larose}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts on hadith literature have rejected this hadith, as all [[Matn|routes of transmission]] either contain narrators charged with dishonesty in disclosing sources or simply conflict with the majority version of the report, which all have authentic routes of transmission but omit the part about the piece of paper being eaten.&lt;ref&gt;Shu'aib al-Arna`ut, ''Tahqiq Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal'', vol. 6, pg. 269, hadith #26,359. Beirut: Mu`assasah al-Risalah.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad Taqi Usmani]], [[Takmilat Fath al-Mulhim]], vol. 1, pg. 69. [[Beirut]]: Dar Ihya al-Turath al-Arabi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain Shia scholars state that Ali's predecessors willfully excluded all references to the right of Ali to be the next caliph after Muhammad died. Some Shias questioned the integrity of the Uthmanic codex, stating that two surahs, ''"al-Nurayn"'' (The Two Lights) and ''"al-Walayah"'' (the Guardianship), which dealt with the virtues of Muhammad's family, were removed.&lt;ref name="The Quran: A User's Guide"/&gt;{{rp|89‚Äì90}}

Al-Khoei addresses this issue and argues for the authenticity and completeness of the Quran on the basis that it was compiled during the lifetime of Muhammad. His argument is based on hadiths and on critically analyzing the situation during and after the life of Muhammad. He states that the collection of the Quran by Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman occurred significantly after the caliphate was decided, and so if Ali's rule had been mentioned, there would have been no need for the Muslims to gather to appoint someone.  The fact that none of the Companions mentioned this supposed alteration, either at the beginning of the caliphate or after Ali became caliph, is regarded as proof that this alteration did not occur.&lt;ref name="Al-Khu'i 1998 150"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena to the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|page=150-158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Khoei also argues that by the time 'Uthman became caliph, Islam had spread to such an extent that it was impossible for anyone to remove anything from the Quran. The value and importance of the Quran during this time protected it from being altered.&lt;ref name="Al-Khu'i 1998 150"/&gt; Uthman could have altered the text, but he would have been unable to convince all those who had memorized the Quran to go along with his alterations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any such alteration also would have been mentioned by Uthman's political opponents and assassins, according to al-Khoei, yet none accused him of this. Finally, he argues that if Uthman had altered the Quran, Ali would have restored it to its original state upon the death of Uthman, especially if verses of his rule had been removed. Instead Ali is seen promoting the Quran during his reign, which is evidence that there was no alteration.&lt;ref name="Al-Khu'i 1998 150"/&gt;

===Manuscripts===
In the 20th century, the [[Sana'a manuscript]] was discovered. It has been [[radiocarbon]] dated to the range 578-669 CE with 95% confidence. The manuscript is a [[palimpsest]] with quranic verses in both upper and lower texts.  The upper text has exactly the same verses and the same order of suras and verses as the standard Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Behnam Sadeghi &amp; Mohsen Goudarzi, "Sana'a and the Origins of the Qu'ran", ''Der Islam'', '''87''' (2012), 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The order of the suras in the lower text of the Sana'a codex is different from the order in the standard Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Behnam Sadeghi &amp; Mohsen Goudarzi, "Sana'a and the Origins of the Qu'ran", ''Der Islam'', '''87''' (2012), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the lower text exhibits extensive variations from the counterpart text in the standard Quran; such that the lower text represents the only surviving early quranic manuscript that does not conform to the 'Uthmanic tradition. The majority of these variations add words and phrases, so as to emphasize or clarify the standard quranic reading. Some scholars have proposed parallels for these variations in reports of variants in 'companion codices' that were kept by individual companions to the Prophet outside of the mainstream tradition of 'Uthman; but these correspondences are much the minority. [[Fran√ßois D√©roche]] proposes, on palaeographic grounds, a date for the lower text in the second half of the first century AH (hence 672 - 722 CE) and summarises the character of the Sana'a Palimpsest, "The scriptio inferior of the Codex ·π¢an øƒÅ æ I has been transcribed in a milieu which adhered to a text of the Qur æan different from the  øUthmanic tradition as well as from the Qur æanic codices of Ibn Mas ø≈´d and Ubayy".

'''''Holoscenes''''' is a multi-format work of [[installation art]] by [[Los Angeles]] artist [[Lars Jan]].

==Description==
''Holoscenes,'' features a single totemic, aquarium-like sculpture sited in public space, standing thirteen feet tall and viewable from 360 degrees. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://earlymorningopera.com/wp/projects/holoscenes/|title=HOLOSCENES|work=Early Morning Opera|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of several hours, a series of performers play variously the guitar, sell fruit, don an [[abaya]], uncoil a garden hose, and perform other familiar tasks as the water rises and falls around each in turn.&lt;ref name="ArtburstMiami"&gt;{{cite news|title=MDC Live Arts' 'Holoscenes' Explores Life Underwater|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/mdc-live-arts-holoscenes-explores-life-underwater-8083268|access-date=8 December 2015| work = [[Miami New Times]] |date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In the Land of Pain''''' is a collection of notes by [[Alphonse Daudet]] chronicling the pain and suffering he experienced from [[tabes dorsalis]], its effects on his relationships with friends, family, and other people, and the various drugs he took and physical treatments he underwent in his fight against the disease. Daudet originally began making these notes for a projected book, but none of the material was published in his lifetime. He planned to use the title ''La Doulou'', a [[Proven√ßal dialect|Proven√ßal]] word for pain. The collection was published in French in 1930 in a volume titled ''La Doulou (La Douleur): 1887‚Äì1895 et Le Tr√©sor d'Arlatan: 1897'', and translated into English in 2002 by [[Julian Barnes]].&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s02X_Gm90ncC&amp;dq=in+the+land+of+pain&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aAn4UpX9AsT_oQTW2YCACA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA | title=''Introduction to'' In the Land of Pain | publisher=Knopf | author=Barnes, Julian | year=2002 | location=New York | pages=V-XV | isbn=0-375-41485-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bouloumi√© |editor1-first=Arlette |title=√âcriture et maladie: "du bon usage des maladies" |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bdlkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22La+Douleur%22+%22Ce+volume+constitue+l%27%C3%A9dition+originale+de+La+Doulou.%22&amp;dq=%22La+Douleur%22+%22Ce+volume+constitue+l%27%C3%A9dition+originale+de+La+Doulou.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=77v4UsnaA6iw7Qbni4CwBQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA |location=Paris |publisher=Imago |publication-date=2003 |page=117 |isbn=2911416767 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Synopsis==
Daudet records observations, experiences, and aphorisms related to his intense suffering over the course of many years. He describes his symptoms in graphic detail and charts their progression. This begins with isolated attacks of agonising nerve pain, and eventually becomes a daily litany of pain and use of drugs like opium and [[chloral hydrate]] to fight it. He comments on the effect of his illness on family and friends, and on his outlook on life.

He describes the different physical treatments he underwent, including being suspended in the air, diets, and a variety of injections. He also details his observations of fellow sufferers of the disease and his interactions with them. In his later years, he frequently spent time at sanitariums, becoming a celebrity among the other patients. He describes his time at these sanitariums in detail. Daudet stopped making these notes a few years before his death.

==Critical response==
Daudet originally planned to use his notes on his sufferings to make either a novel or an autobiography. After discussing the projected work with fellow writer [[Edmond de Goncourt]], Goncourt predicted the work would be superb because Daudet would be writing from intense personal experience. Although the book was never realized, translator Julian Barnes agrees with Goncourt's prediction in relation to the collection in its current form. He believes the notes format is appropriate and fitting for the subject because of its implication of passing time and its absence of disguise.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

According to critic Richard Eder, this work is worthy of lasting recognition. Daudet uses wit to probe a dark and distressing subject, providing the reader with powerful images. Daudet surprisingly responds to his pain often with humor and spirit, and even comments mockingly on his disease and its symptoms at times. Some of the most poignant moments in the book are Daudet's expressions of sympathy for his fellow sufferers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/books/another-country.html | title=Another Country | publisher=New York Times | date=2 February 2003 | accessdate=9 February 2014 | author=Eder, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johanna Helena Herolt''' (1 May 1668 ‚Äì 1723) was an 18th-century botanical artist from Germany.

==Biography==
Herolt was the eldest daughter of the painters [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] and [[Johann Andreas Graff]], and learned to paint from them along with her sister [[Dorothea Maria Graff]].&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/37866 Johanna Helena Herolt] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; Though she was born in Frankfurt, in 1670 the family moved to Nuremberg, where she was raised.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; In 1681 her mother returned to Frankfurt without her father, in order to live with her mother after her stepfather [[Jacob Marrel]]'s death.&lt;ref name=DVN&gt;[http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/DVN/lemmata/data/graff Johanna Helena Herolt] in the Instituut voor Nederlandse Geschiedenis&lt;/ref&gt; Though Johann Graff joined his family later, in 1686 Merian left her husband and moved with her two daughters and her mother to a religious community of [[Labadist]]s in [[Wieuwerd]], Friesland.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; Johann Graff made various attempts at reconciliation but eventually returned to Germany.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; In 1691 the four women moved to [[Amsterdam]], where they set up a studio painting flowers and botanical subjects, continuing Merian's work on "The Caterpillar Book".&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; Johanna married the merchant Jacob Hendrik Herolt, also an ex-Labadist, on 28 June 1692.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; They had two children and Johanna began to take on her own commissions, working for [[Agnes Block]] and the [[Amsterdam Hortus]] like her mother.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt;

Johanna moved with her husband to [[Surinam]] in 1711 where she died sometime after 1723.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

==Works==
A numbered series of 49 drawings signed by Herolt on vellum are in the collection of the [[Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum]], in Brunswick.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; This series was possibly commissioned by the Mennonite botanist and collector [[Agnes Block]]. Other drawings by Herolt are in the British Museum.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt;

{{lang|fr|'''Jupiter et S√©m√©l√©'''}} (1894-95; [[English language|English]], ''Jupiter and Semele'') is a painting by the [[French people|French]] [[Symbolist]] artist [[Gustave Moreau]] (1826-1898).  It depicts a moment from the [[classical myth]]&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', III.&lt;/ref&gt; of the mortal woman [[Semele]], mother of the god [[Dionysus]], and her lover, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the king of the gods. She was treacherously advised by the goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], Jupiter‚Äôs wife, to ask him to appear to her in all his divine splendor. He obliged, but, in so doing, brought about her violent death by his divine thunder and lightning. The painting is a representation of "divinized physical love" and the overpowering experience that consumes Semele as the god appears in his supreme beauty which has been called "quite simply the most sumptuous expression imaginable of an orgasm".&lt;ref&gt; Pierre, Jos√©, "Gustave Moreau through the Eyes of Succeeding Generations"; In: Paladilhe, Jean, and Jos√© Pierre (1972), ''Gustave Moreau'', Trans. by Bettina Wadia. [[New York City]]: [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]]. [This volume also contains a separate study, Paladilhe's "Gustave Moreau: His Life and Work"], pg 128.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Of this work, Moreau himself wrote, "Semele, penetrated by the divine effluence, regenerated and purified by this consecration, dies struck by lightning and with her dies the genius of terrestrial love, the genius with the goat hooves".{{citation required|date=March 2017}}

==Description==
Moreau described his canvas thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;"In the midst of colossal aerial buildings, with neither foundations nor roof-tops, covered with teeming, quivering vegetation, this sacred flora standing out against the dark blues of the starry vaults and the deserts of the sky, the God so often invoked appears in his still veiled splendor."{{citation required|date=March 2017}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Moreau‚Äôs work depicts an intricate, intense, and startling mystical world, haunting and heavily laden with symbolic imagery.  Its iconography is drawn from the ancient myth, from Symbolist writings and from his own personal interpretations, which are deliberately meant to be mysterious and ambiguous. Jupiter is represented conventionally, seated ‚Äú[[Christ in Majesty|in Majesty]]‚Äù with the hapless and bloodied Semele astride his right thigh. His gaze is severe, wide-eyed and fixed straight ahead in fierce prepossession. His throne and surrounding court, however, present an unorthodox and extravagant profusion of architectural and vegetal elements which ‚Äî while depicted in fine, realistic, even  jewel-like, detail ‚Äî give the overall impression of a dream-like fantasy world. Everywhere a profusion of vivid colors vies with dark shadows for prominence. Countless teaming gods, goddesses and allegorical figures seem to exist at different scales, independent of, and oblivious to, one another.  The eye must accommodate bizarre shifts in proportion as it ranges across the canvas. Among the figures are three immediately at the feet of Jupiter: a figure of "Sadness" (cradling a bloodied sword), a Great [[Pan (god)|Pan]], and a female ‚Äú[[Death (personification)|Death]]‚Äù holding aloft a white lily. (Moreau: ‚ÄúAt the foot of the throne, Death and Sorrow form the tragic basis of Human Life, and not far from them, under the aegis of the eagle of Jupiter, the great [[Pan (god)|Pan]], symbol of Earth, bows his sorrowful brow, mourning his slavery and exile, while at his feet is piled the somber phalanx of the monsters of [[Erebus]] and [[Nyx|Night]]‚Ä¶.‚Äù)  Jupiter's right foot rests on [[Ouroboros|a snake biting its own tail]]. A frightful [[Hecate]], with her ''[[polos]]'' and crescent moon, appears in the lower left corner. Among the other figures are a three-headed demon and several winged, angelic figures.{{citation required|date=March 2017}}

==Reception and interpretation==
The French writer and painter [[Malcolm de Chazal]] (1902&amp;ndash;1981) called the central image of ''Jupiter and Semele'' ‚Äúthis birth-death in one‚Äù. The Swedish surrealist [[Ragnar von Holten]] (1934&amp;ndash;2009) described the work as ‚Äúan allegory of regeneration by death‚Äù.{{citation required|date=March 2017}}

The theme of Jupiter and Semele has also been interpreted by the painters [[Jacopo Tintoretto]]  (''ca.'' 1545) and [[Jean-Baptiste Deshays de Colleville]] (''ca.'' 1760).

The [[aircraft livery|aircraft liveries]] and [[logo]]s of [[airline]]s are used to provide distinctive [[brand]]ing for corporate and commercial reasons.  They also have to combine powerful symbols of national identity while being acceptable to an international market.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://vcj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/6/3/305|journal=Visual Communication|volume=6|issue=3|pages=305‚Äì344|year=2007|doi=10.1177/1470357207081002|title=National pride, global capital: a social semiotic analysis of transnational visual branding in the airline industry|author=Crispin Thurlow and Giorgia Aiello}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unpopular designs==
[[British Airways]] introduced varied and unusual tailfin designs in 1997.  These "airline liveries and logos" were intended to make the airline's branding more cosmopolitan and were described as "arty" and "ethnic".  They were unpopular with many customers and also caused confusion for ground controllers who had more difficulty recognising the [[British Airways ethnic liveries]] aircraft to give clear taxiing instructions.  Despite the ¬£60M expense of this livery, it was replaced completely in 2001 and the airline has now returned to a more traditional design based upon the [[Union flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk/1325127.stm|title=R.I.P. British Airways' funky tailfins|publisher=BBC|date=11 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brussels Airlines|Brussels Airlines']] first logo was a stylised letter [[B]] composed of 13 dots resembling a [[runway]].  This was thought to be unlucky and protests by [[superstition|superstitious]] passengers caused the airline to add another dot.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6383171.stm|title='Unlucky' airline logo grounded|publisher=BBC|date=21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of '''colossal sculptures that were carved ''in situ'' ''' (or "in place"), sometimes referred to as "living rock". This list includes two colossal stones that were intended to be moved. However, they were never broken free of the quarry in which they were carved, and therefore they would be considered carved in situ. Most of these were carved in ancient times.

In most cases, especially in [[India]], the sculptures were carved out of "soft" rock like [[basalt]] or volcanic [[tuff]]. However, in some cases they were carved out of harder rock like [[sandstone]], or even [[granite]] in the case of the [[unfinished obelisk]]. The Egyptians may have been limited to using 10-pound [[dolerite]] balls to chip away at the granite.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Dr. I.E.S.: The Pyramids of Egypt 1986/1947 p. 269-273&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dynamite]] was used in the carving of Mount Rushmore, another of the few colossal sculptures that was carved out of granite.

'''''Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence''''' is an early sculpture by the Italian artist [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. It depicts the saint at the moment of his martyrdom, being burnt alive on a [[Gridiron (cooking)|gridiron]]. According to Bernini's biographer, [[Filippo Baldinucci]], the sculpture was completed when Bernini was 15 years old, implying it was finished in the year 1614.&lt;ref name="baldinucci"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldinucci |first=Filippo |editor=Catherine Enggass |title=Vita Del Cavaliere Gio. Lorenzo Bernino |publisher=Nabu Press |location= |page=12 |year=1966 |isbn=978-1-148-63920-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians have dated the sculpture between 1615 and 1618. A date of 1617 seems most likely.&lt;ref name="coliva"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coliva |first=Caterina |title=Bernini scultore: La tecnica esecutiva |publisher=De Luca Editori d'Arte |location= |year=2002 |isbn=978-88-8016-506-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is less than life-size in dimensions, measuring 108 by 66&amp;nbsp;cm.

The sculpture is now held in the [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]] as part of the Contini Bonacossi Collection.

==Commission==
There is some confusion over the patronage of the sculpture. Filippo Baldinucci simply wrote it was done for Leone Strozzi, a Florentine nobleman living in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="baldinucci"/&gt; Bernini‚Äôs son, [[Domenico| Domenico Bernini]], who wrote a biography of his father, paints a more complex picture, suggesting that Bernini executed the sculpture out of his devotion for the saint rather than for a specific commission.&lt;ref name="bernini"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernini |first=Domenico |editor=Franco Mormando |title=The Life of Giano Lorenzo Bernini |publisher=Penn State University Press |location=University Park |page=15 |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-271-03748-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michela Uliva suggests this may be true, with Bernini's supporter [[Pope Urban VIII|Cardinal Maffeo Barberni]] enthusing the artist with the burgeoning post-Tridentine interest in early [[Christian martyrs]].&lt;ref name="coliva"/&gt;

Recent historians tend to agree with Domenico Bernini's statement that Leone Strozzi was impressed by the sculpture and acquired it for his Villa del Viminale. Irving Lavin suggests that Strozzi may have become familiar with the work as he was commissioning a chapel in the church of [[Sant'Andrea della Valle]] at the same time as Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, particularly as the Strozzi Chapel included a tomb dedicated to Cardinal [[Lorenzo Strozzi]] (who died in [[Avignon]] in 1571) and bore the same name as the saint.&lt;ref name="lavin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavin |first=Irving |title=Visible Spirit: The Art of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Volume 1 |publisher=Pindar Press |location= |page=69 |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-899828-39-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the statue is included in Strozzi inventory in 1632, described as a "San Lorenzo above a modern gridiron".&lt;ref name="lavin"/&gt;

==Creation==
The sculpture was created from a single block of [[Carrara]] marble. Restoration in 1997 revealed that Bernini used different tools to create different surface textures on various parts of the sculpture. The reverse side of the gridiron has not been polished and finished in the same way as the front, implying that the artwork was clearly meant to be seen from the front only.&lt;ref name="coliva"/&gt; A highly sculpted pedestal, made of wood and gilded with golden paint, was designed as a platform for the sculpture.&lt;ref name ="coliva"/&gt; There is a possibility this was also executed by Bernini, although its design suggests that while it was a Strozzi family commission, it was done at a later date.&lt;ref name="bernardini"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bernardini, Maria Grazia |editor2=Maurizio Fagiolo dell'Arco |title=Gian Lorenzo Bernini: Regista del barocco  |publisher=Skira |location= |page=186 |year=1999 |isbn=978-88-8118-484-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and interpretation==

===Subject===
The subject of the artwork is [[St Lawrence|Lawrence of Rome]], who was condemned to death by the Roman Emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] in the year 258 C.E. for defending the Christian faith. According to tradition, Lawrence was burnt to death by being placed on a gridiron.

In depicting a highly naturalistic St Lawrence, tortured and yet undergoing some kind of spiritual epiphany, the sculpture presents a taste of many of the themes that Bernini would adopt during the course of his artistic oeuvre, and that would come to represent many of the most pertinent features of the artistic traditions in Italian Baroque art‚Äîthat of solitary figures undergoing intense emotional states, whilst being depicted with illusionistic verisimilitude. Unlike earlier depictions of Lawrence, there are no other figures‚Äîno sign of his judge, torturers or spectators witnessing in depth. Rather the focus is solely on the martyr and his emotional state.

===Saint Lawrence's emotional state===
Commentators have subtly varied in describing and interpreting the face of Lawrence. Domenico Bernini contextualised the creation with the anecdote that Bernini placed his actual hand in a flame and fashioned Lawrence‚Äôs expression from his own facial reaction seen in a mirror; thus implying that the focus of the portrait of Lawrence would be the physical pain.&lt;ref name="bernini"/&gt;

Yet later commentators have described Lawrence's face not as one of pain, but of being "tired" or more commonly of being spiritual rapt. To Howard Hibbard, the sculpture makes a clear religious statement of spiritual salvation‚Äîinner strength overcomes external bodily pain.&lt;ref name="hibbard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbard |first=Howard |title=Bernini |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-14-013598-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, observation of the sculpture seems to bear this out. The martyr almost turns away from the pain, his upper body and head reaching upwards towards the skies, with his clear, almost peaceful eyes, focussed in the direction of God.

Others take Bernini's depiction of Lawrence even further: describing the martyr as being "reclined on his left elbow languidly as any Roman banqueter", and thwarting his torturers with "a carved attitude of rapture".&lt;ref name="spivey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spivey |first=Nigel |title=Enduring Creation: Art, Pain, and Fortitude |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-520-23022-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another art historian, Avigdor Poseq, interprets the expression a little differently: ‚Äúthe calm face was apparently meant to convey the intensive of the martyr‚Äôs fear of God.‚Äù He continues by suggesting that Bernini presented Lawrence with an outstretched to hand to indicate the martyr‚Äôs desire to be turned over by his torturers, thus exposing even more of his flesh to the flames below.&lt;ref name="poseq"&gt;{{cite book|last=Poseq |first=Avigdor |title=Bernini Revisited: New Insights into His Work |publisher=Academon |location= |year=2008 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical excellence===
Twentieth-century commentators have largely agreed on the technical excellence of the sculpture. [[Rudolf Wittkower]] speaks of the ‚Äúhigh degree of technical perfection [and] the anatomical precision and an infallible sense for the organic coherence and structure of the human body.‚Äù&lt;ref name="wittkower"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wittkower |first=Rudolf |title=Gian Lorenzo Bernini: The Sculptor of the Roman Baroque |publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London |year=1955 |page=3 |isbn=978-0-7148-3715-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irving Lavin sees, in the flesh-like quality achieved with the marble, a criticism of Michelangelo, who mastered design and anatomy but not the appearance of flesh.&lt;ref name="preimesberger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Preimesberger |first=Rudolf |editor=Irving Lavin |title=Gianlorenzo Bernini: New Aspects of His Art and Thought |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |location=University Park |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-271-00387-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flames also receive attention. During the baroque period, the ability to represent to recreate nature, as in flames, water, flesh, in illusionistic marble would be a frequent challenge. Bernini's "attempt to represent leaping flames in sculpture is a tour de force" &lt;ref name="wittkower"/&gt; "depicting convincingly something as evanescent as flames, or as dependent on colour as glowing coals."&lt;ref name="avery"&gt;{{cite book|last=Avery |first=Charles |title=Bernini: Genius of the Baroque |publisher=Bulfinch |location= |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-8212-2465-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniele Pinton talks of the "skilful rendition of the flames under the gridiron, where the portrayal of an immaterial element such as fire is magnificently rendered in stone." &lt;ref name="pinton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinton |first=Daniele |title=Bernini: I percorsi nell'arte |publisher=ATS Italia |location= |year=2009 |isbn=978-88-7571-777-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Avery goes as far to see the technical innovation of the work as its raison-d‚Äô√™tre. He cites the piece‚Äôs naturalism, its emotional intensity, his use of subject previously never previously depicted as a full three-dimensional sculpture and concludes that ‚Äúthe work is a manifesto of his ability on the threshold of his adult career, much like the ‚Äòmaster piece‚Äô with which a craftsman matriculates into his guild.‚Äù &lt;ref name="avery"/&gt;

==Recent history==
At the start of the 1800s, the sculpture was moved to another Strozzi-owned palace in Rome, and then around 1830 it was moved to the [[Palazzo Strozzi]] in Florence. In 1935, it then became part of the [[Alessandro Contini-Bonacossi|Contini-Bonacossi]] collection, before being acquired by the Italian state in 1969. It was shown in the Palazzo Pitti from 1974, and then in the Uffizi from December 1998.&lt;ref name="coliva"/&gt;

==Biography==
He was born David Dominic Mwangi&lt;ref name=Gale /&gt; in [[Nanyuki]], Kenya, and was educated at Nanyuki Secondary School, [[:de:Kenyatta College]] and studied at the [[University of Leeds]] for a while.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;He did not complete a full university degree at University of Leeds.{{cite web|url=https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/meja-mwangi|title=Meja Mwangi biography&lt;!--, Agent: Annemarie Friedli--&gt;|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked on odd-jobs for French Broadcasting Corporation, a British Council in Nairobi for Visual Aids Officer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgqgREKxjNoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Meja+Mwangi%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt5tjk9vDPAhUniFQKHUPmB-QQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Meja%20Mwangi%22&amp;f=false|title=An H.E.B.

He was [[Fellow in Writing]] at the [[University of Iowa]] (1975-6).&lt;ref name=Gale /&gt;

Between 1975 and 1976, Meja Mwangi stayed in the United States of America as a Fellow in Writing at [[Iowa University]] writers‚Äô workshop. Mwangi, the path to a popular writer was never obtained casually. After prolonged period in the Kenyan and African publishing scene over the years, he moved to the US after the recognition in several awards and winning reputation.&lt;ref name=nation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/weekend/Meja-Mwangi--the-reclusive-writer-with-a-mighty-pen/1220-2111002-jetitvz/index.html|title=Meja Mwangi, the reclusive writer with a mighty pen|last=Ciugu |first=Mwagiru|publisher=Nation Media Group|date=2013-12-13|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=nations|Writing has been very hard work for him. It was certainly not a very easy occupation, though as moving from Kenya to the United States, the literal environment as well as material for Meja Mwangi will be abundant to be advantages for his career.}}

American publishers who was interested him as a juvenile literature novelist started to issue his works, and those publishers also put on print ''Mama Dudu, the Insect Woman (2007)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mama Dudu, the Insect Woman|publisher=HM Books|location=Columbus, OH|isbn=978-1-84728-468-6|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as two screen plays, ''Power  (2009)'', and ''Blood Brothers (2009)'' a work expanded from ''Mama Dudu, the Insect Woman''. His best known early work is a trilogy of ''Kill Me Quick'' (1973), ''Going Down River Road'' (1976),&lt;ref name=goingd/&gt; and ''The Cockroach Dance'' (1979),&lt;ref name=cockr/&gt; illustrating the urban landscape in Kenya with struggle against poverty and epidemic of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of African Biography, via Oxford African American Studies Center database, accessed March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is notable for his illustrations to [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]]'s ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]'', as well as a distinctive style of villas built outside Warsaw. He was probably most well known for his architecture ‚Äî ≈öwidermajer. This was a regional architectural style common in the Otwock, Poland region. These structures were wooden in construction and were popularized from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. Its creator was Micha≈Ç Elwiro Andriolli. It is characterized by gazebos and decorations above the windows, some of the houses also had turrets. Pine trees were planted together with the buildings as part of the composition.

== Life ==

[[File:Michal Elwiro Andriolli.jpg|thumb|''W≈Çadys≈Çaw Walkiewicz'', portrait of painter Micha≈Ç Elwiro Andriolli, 19th century, paper, lithography. [[National Museum of Lithuania]].]]
Andriolli was born on 2 November 1836 in [[Vilnius|Vilna]] (modern Vilnius), then part of the [[Russian Empire|Empire of Russia]] as a son of Francesco Andriolli to a family of an Italian emigrant, a veteran of the [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s [[Grande Arm√©e]]. In 1855, he went to Moscow, where he started his studies at the School of Painting and Sculpture. In 1858 he graduated from the Imperial Academy of Art in Petersburg. Andriolli received a scholarship and in 1861 he went to Rome, where he continued his studies at the [[Accademia di San Luca]]. He returned to Lithuania and took part in the [[January Uprising]] against the [[Russian Empire|Imperialism of the Russian Govermant]]. Arrested by the tsarist authorities, he managed to escape from [[Kaunas Prison]] and reach London and then Paris.

An emissary of the [[Great Emigration|Committee of Polish Emigration]], he returned to Russian-held Poland, but was again arrested in 1866. Tried for his part in the Uprising, he was sentenced to [[katorga]] in [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]]. Pardoned in 1871, Andriolli moved to Poland and settled in [[Warsaw]]. There he started his career as an illustrator for various newspapers, notably the ''[[Tygodnik Ilustrowany]]'', ''[[K≈Çosy]]'' and ''[[Biesiada Literacka]]''. His work for various Warsaw-based newspapers made him one of the most renown illustration makers of the time and Andriolli was hired to illustrate some of the classic works of the [[Polish literature]], notably the works by Adam Mickiewicz, [[Juliusz S≈Çowacki]] and [[J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski]]. His pictures for the first editions of Mickiewicz's ''Pan Tadeusz'' and ''[[Konrad Wallenrod]]'', prepared between 1879 and 1882, are regarded as icons of Polish literature even now.

In March 1883, Andriolli visited Paris where he was guest in home of [[W≈Çadys≈Çaw Mickiewicz]] the oldest son of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. Between 1883 and 1886, he lived in Paris, where he worked on illustrating the French language editions of works by [[William Shakespeare]] and [[James Fenimore Cooper]]. Upon his return he also prepared frescoes in several churches, notably in [[Kaunas]].

In the later years of his life, Andriolli found refuge in a small villa he designed for himself near Anielin in what is now the town of [[Otwock]] at the [[≈öwider]] River, close to Warsaw. Apart from his own house, he designed several other villas in the area, creating a distinctive architectural style of Warsaw's suburbs. The ''[[≈õwidermajer]]'', as it was later dubbed by [[Konstanty Ildefons Ga≈Çczy≈Ñski]], was an eclectic mixture of traditional [[Mazovia]]n village wooden architecture with Alpine and Siberian styles. It remains a distinctive feature of many of Warsaw's suburbs. Micha≈Ç Andriolli died on 23 August 1893 in [[Na≈Çƒôcz√≥w]] and is buried at the local cemetery.

== Works ==

Micha≈Ç Andriolli illustrated many books of Polish authors, including:

* [[Eliza Orzeszkowa]] novel titled "Meir Ezofowicz",
* [[Adam Mickiewicz]] ‚Äì [[Pan Tadeusz]],
* [[J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski]] ‚Äì [[Stara Ba≈õ≈Ñ]] in 1879,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4052">'''Monoprinting''' is a form of [[printmaking]] that has lines or images that can only be made once, unlike most printmaking, which allows for multiple originals. There are many techniques of monoprinting. Examples of standard printmaking techniques which can be used to make monoprints include [[lithography]], [[woodcut]], and [[etching]].

== Types ==
A monoprint is a single impression of an image made from a reprintable block. Materials such as metal plates, litho stones or wood blocks are used for etching upon. Rather than printing multiple copies of a single image, only one impression may be produced, either by painting or making a [[collage]] on the block. Etching plates may also be inked in a way that is expressive and unique in the strict sense, in that the image cannot be reproduced exactly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/m/monoprint Definition of monoprinting] Tate Museum online. Retrieved March 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Monoprints may also involve elements that change, where the artist reworks the image in between impressions or after printing so that no two prints are absolutely identical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonprintmakers.com/resources/techniques/monoprint Photo of monoprinting] Washington Printmakers' Gallery Retrieved March 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Monoprints may include collage, hand-painted additions, and a form of tracing by which thick ink is laid down on a table, paper is placed on top and is then drawn on, transferring the ink onto the paper. Monoprints can also be made by altering the type, color, and pressure of the ink used to create different prints. When you create a monoprint, it is possible to copy work from separate pieces of artwork onto one monoprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monoprint ink technique|url=https://www.thetbank.com/blog/112-creative-art-project-ideas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monoprints are known as the most painterly method among the printmaking techniques; it is essentially a printed painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monoprints.com/info/monoprints.html  "What are monoprints and monotypes?"] Monoprints.com Retrieved March 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristic of this method is that no two prints are alike. The beauty of this medium is also in its spontaneity and its combination of printmaking, painting and drawing media.

== Technique ==
Monoprinting and [[monotyping]] are very similar. The difference between monoprinting and monotype printing is that monoprinting has a matrix that can be reused, but not to produce an identical result.  With monotyping there are no permanent marks on the matrix, and at most two impressions (copies) can be obtained. Both involve the transfer of ink from a plate to the paper, canvas, or other surface that will ultimately hold the work of art. In the case of monotyping the plate is a featureless plate. It contains no features that will impart any definition to successive prints. The most common feature would be the etched or engraved line on a metal plate. In the absence of any permanent features on the surface of the plate, all articulation of imagery is dependent on one unique inking, resulting in one unique print. Monoprints, on the other hand, are the results of plates that have permanent features on them. Monoprints can be thought of as variations on a theme, with the theme resulting from some permanent features being found on the plate ‚Äì lines, textures ‚Äì that persist from print to print. Variations are confined to those resulting from how the plate is inked prior to each print. The variations are endless, but certain permanent features on the plate will tend to persist from one print to the next.

Monoprinting has been used by many artists, among them [[Georg Baselitz]].  Some [[old master print]]s, like etchings by [[Rembrandt]] with individual manipulation of ink as "surface tone", or hand-painted etchings by [[Degas]] (usually called monotypes) might be classifiable as monoprints, but they are rarely so described.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5125">'''Nas√Æhatn√¢me''' ({{lang-ota|ŸÜÿµŸäÿ≠ÿ™ ŸÜÿßŸÖŸá}}, ''Na·π£ƒ´·∏•at-nƒÅme'') were a type of guidance letter for [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] sultans, similar to [[mirrors for princes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Third Congress on the Social and Economic History of Turkey|year=1990|publisher=Varia Turcica|isbn=9780941469012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They draw on a variety of historical and religious sources, and were influenced by the governance of previous empires such as the Seljuk Turks or the Mongols, as well as by early Muslim history and by contemporary events.

==History==
Nas√Æhatn√¢me became common in the sixteenth century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya|title=The Ottoman Empire and the world around it|year=2011|publisher=I. B. Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-122-9|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but built on earlier works such as the Kutadgu Bilig (''Knowledge of Prosperity''), written in 1070 by Yusuf Has Hacip. Early influences include the in≈üa literature of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ePmqBgAAQBAJ|title = The Culture of Letter-Writing in Pre-Modern Islamic Society|last = Gully|first = Adrian|date = 2008-02-07|publisher = Edinburgh University Press|isbn = 9780748633746|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some refer to [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name="Good Old Days"&gt;{{cite journal|last=ƒ∞nan|first=Kenan|title=Remembering the Good Old Days: the Ottoman Nasihatname [Advice  Letters] Literature of the 17th Century|journal=Ideology, Society and Values|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, nas√Æhatn√¢me are different from [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] ''Chronographia'', and were written for a different audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ottomans and the Balkans: A Discussion of Historiography|year=2002|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004119024|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nas√Æhatn√¢me were even commissioned by aspirants to Ottoman government - including, in one case, by the [[Phanariot]] [[Alexandros Skarlatou Kallimaki]], the probable father of [[Skarlatos Voyvodas Alexandrou Kallimaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Philiou|title=Biography of an Empire: Governing Ottomans in an Age of Revolution|year=2011|isbn=9780520266339|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 17th century, a sense of imperial decline began to affect the content of these texts; more than just advocating a return to some golden age (i.e. [[Suleyman the Magnificent]]) they highlighted specific systemic problems in the empire - including nepotism, revolts, military defeat, and corrupt [[Janissary|Janissaries]].&lt;ref name="Good Old Days"/&gt;

==Content==
Nas√Æhatn√¢me typically state a clear moral reason for why they are written and presented to leaders; whether piety, or morality, or realpolitik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comit√© international d'√©tudes pr√©-ottomanes et ottomanes, VIth Symposium|journal=Varia Turcica|year=1987|volume=4|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Nihon Bijutsuin'''|Êó•Êú¨ÁæéË°ìÈô¢|lit. "Japan Visual Arts Academy"}} is a non-governmental artistic organization in Japan dedicated to ''[[Nihonga]]'' (Japanese style painting). The academy promotes the art of Nihonga through a biennial exhibition, the ''[[Inten]]'' Exhibition .

==History==
The Nihon Bijutsuin was founded by [[Okakura Tenshin]] at the [[Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]] in 1898, together with a group of artists, who included [[Hashimoto Gah≈ç]], [[Yokoyama Taikan]], [[Kanzan Shimomura|Shimomura Kanzan]], [[Hishida Shuns≈ç]] and several others, as a reaction against stylistic restrictions of the government-sponsored [[Japan Art Academy|Bunten]] exhibitions. Nihon Bijutsuin moved with Okakura Tenshin to Izura, Ibaraki (now the city of [[Kitaibaraki, Ibaraki|Ibaraki]]) in 1906. However, Okakura was soon recruited by [[Ernest Francisco Fenollosa]] to assist in his efforts to introduce Chinese and Japanese arts to the western world via the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], and soon lost interest in guiding the new organization. When Okakura died in 1913, the group dissolved.

Nihon Bijutsuin was resurrected a year later in 1914 under Yokoyama Taikan, who relocated it back to [[Yanaka, Tokyo|Yanaka]], Tokyo. In 1920, separate sections were established for [[Japanese sculpture]] and for western-style ([[y≈çga (art)|y≈çga painting]]), These separate sections were abolished in 1960, and currently the Institute is currently devoted exclusively to ''Nihonga'' painting. 

Nihon Bijutsuin should not be confused with the [[Japan Art Academy]] or the [[Japan Academy of Arts]], which are completely different organizations.

==Inten Exhibitions==
The most important function of Nihon Bijutsuin is the organization and promotion of the {{nihongo|''inten''|Èô¢Â±ï}} biennial fine arts exhibitions. The Spring Exhibition is held in early April, for two weeks at the [[Mitsukoshi]] Department Store in Tokyo, followed by a tour around Japan for four months, at ten different locations. The sizes of the works which can be displayed is fixed at under 150 x 75&amp;nbsp;cm for rectangular works and under 106 x 106&amp;nbsp;cm for square works.

The Fall Exhibition is held in September for two weeks at the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum]], followed by a year-long tour to 10 different locations around Japan. The Fall Exhibition contains larger works, with 225 x 180&amp;nbsp;cm as the upper limit.

'''Photobatik''' is one of [[Photogram]] techniques produced by a Japanese artist [[Yoshio Machida]] in the 1990s. Photograms are produced by partial exposure and development of the entire photosensitive surface. Photobatik is "whole exposure and partial development." Machida has expanded his technique to overexposure of the photographic paper followed by only fixing the image, resulting in a pink image.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12984">The '''San Francisco Art Association''' (SFAA) was an organization that promoted [[California]] artists, held art exhibitions, published a periodical, and established the first art school west of [[Chicago]]. The SFAA - which, by 1961, completed a long sequence of mission shifts and re-namings to become the [[San Francisco Art Institute]] - was the predecessor of the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]. Over its lifetime, the association helped establish a [[Northern California]] regional flavor of California [[Tonalism]] as differentiated from [[Southern California]] [[American Impressionism]].&lt;ref name=Nash1995&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nash |first1=Steven A. |first2=Bill |last2=Berkson |author3=Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=laQ6NQqXxEoC&amp;pg=PA56 |title=Facing Eden: 100 Years of Landscape Art in the Bay Area |publisher=University of California Press |year=1995 |pages=35, 41, 44, 56, 58, 186 |isbn=0-520-20363-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
SFAA was founded on March 28, 1871, by a group of some 23‚Äì30 artists, primarily [[landscape art]]ists led by [[Virgil Macey Williams]], with two goals: the forming of an art library, the promotion of art exhibitions, and the eventual establishment of an art school.&lt;ref name=Circular1874/&gt;  Painter Juan B. Wandesforde hosted the organizational meeting and was elected its first president. Other early artist members included [[George Henry Burgess]], [[Gideon Jacques Denny]], [[Andrew P. Hill]], [[Thomas Hill (painter)|Thomas Hill]], [[William Keith (artist)|William Keith]], [[Hugo Wilhelm Arthur Nahl|Arthur Nahl]], [[Charles Christian Nahl]] and [[Ernest Narjot]].&lt;ref name=Karlstrom&gt;{{cite book |last=Karlstrom |first=Paul |title=San Francisco Art Institute: Illustrious History, 1871-Present |publisher=San Francisco Art Institute |year=1996 |pages=7‚Äì10}} (Exhibition catalog)&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of painter-photographer [[George Henry Burgess]] among the founders connected the association with the nascent field of [[fine art photography]].&lt;ref name=photographers&gt;{{cite book |last1=Palmquist |first1=Peter E. |first2=Thomas R. |last2=Kailbourn |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nne4L9h27RsC |title=Pioneer photographers of the far west: a biographical dictionary, 1840-1865 |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2000 |pages=111, 137 |isbn=0-8047-3883-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few months, SFAA had elected its first honorary member: [[Albert Bierstadt]], the financially successful landscape painter from New York who was at that time sojourning in California. Bierstadt was also interested in [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic photography]].&lt;ref name=photographers/&gt; By 1874, SFAA had 700 regular members and 100 life members, the latter paying $100 for the privilege.&lt;ref name=Circular1874&gt;{{cite book |author=United States Bureau of Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n1MXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA49 |title=Circular of Information of the Bureau of Education |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |year=1874 |pages=49‚Äì51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quarterly receptions were attracting some 1000 people and the semi-annual exhibitions, running for two months each, brought over 7000 viewers.&lt;ref name=Circular1874/&gt; In 1874, there were similar public art institutions in only three other United States cities: [[New York City|New York]], [[Boston]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=Circular1874/&gt;

From the beginning of the [[Bohemian Club]] in 1872, a web of interconnections between it and SFAA was apparent.&lt;ref name=Karlstrom/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee1999/&gt; Many artists were members of both organizations, and art patronage from well-to-do Bohemians helped provide a living for the all-male artists who were invited to join the Bohemian Club. SFAA exhibits in the late 19th century were very successful‚Äîmany of the participating artists sold a year's worth of production to wealthy Bohemian and society patrons. By 1915, SFAA prosperity was intimately tied to Bohemian purchasing habits.&lt;ref name=Lee1999/&gt;

==School of art==
In February 1874, SFAA founded the California School of Design, installing Virgil Macey Williams as director. Subsequent directors included: [[Emil Carlsen]] (1887-1889), [[Arthur Frank Mathews|Arthur Mathews]] (1890-1906), Robert Howe Fletcher, [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos]] (1914-1917), [[Lee Fritz Randolph]] (1917-1941), and [[William Alexander Gaw]] (1941-1945).  In 1893, the institution moved into the former Mark Hopkins mansion on Nob Hill, using the name Mark Hopkins Institute of Art (for the building but not the School of Design), and became affiliated with the [[University of California]]. In 1906, [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|the devastating fire following the earthquake]] destroyed the building. A simpler replacement was built in one year, using the name San Francisco Institute of Art.

During his tenure as Director Pedro de Lemos, an award-winning printmaker, pastelist, and leader of the American Arts &amp; Crafts Movement, created the Departments of Illustration as well as Decorative Design, and introduced the first courses in etching west of Chicago.  He resigned after a long dispute with the Board of Directors, which rejected his recommendations for increased faculty salaries, student-teaching grants, building maintenance, and additional painting and life classes.  He became the Director of the Stanford University Art Gallery and Museum.&lt;ref name="edwardsrw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Pedro de Lemos, Lasting Impressions: Works on Paper| date=2015|publisher=Davis Publications Inc.| location=Worcester, Mass.|isbn=9781615284054|pages=6-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His replacement, the highly regarded artist Lee Randolph, is credited with reviving and enlarging the school. The school's name was changed to the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA). In 1926 it moved into a new building on Chestnut Street, still the main campus of the San Francisco Art Institute. In 1941 the celebrated modernist painter William Gaw proved an adept administrator who maintained enrollment by revising the curriculum during World War II.  In the spring of 1945 Douglas Macagy became the school‚Äôs Director.&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Jennie V.

==Museum of art==
An art collection existed at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art and could be visited by the public, but it did not take on the identity of a museum. Accounts differ regarding how much of the collection was saved from the 1906 fire. The [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915)|Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] (PPIE) in 1915 increased local public interest in art and calls for San Francisco to have a permanent art museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ben |last=Macomber |title=The Jewel City |location=San Francisco |publisher=Newbegin |year=1915 |url=http://www.books-about-california.com/Pages/The_Jewel_City/The_Jewel_City_Chap_12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, the exposition organizers decided to give the [[Palace of Fine Arts]] to SFAA if $30,000 in operating expenses could be raised by May 1, 1916.&lt;ref&gt;''San Francisco Examiner'', 28‚Äì30 April 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; In writing up the contract, the negotiating teams were each led by a [[Bohemian Club]] member: Charles Templeton Crocker represented SFAA, and his uncle [[William H. Crocker]] stood for the Panama-Pacific group. The building, intended only for temporary use, was deeded to SFAA and the land it was on, formerly part of the Presidio, was deeded to the City of San Francisco by an act of Congress, contingent on the federal government being granted the right to operate a spur railroad line from Fort Mason to the Presidio.&lt;ref&gt;Oakland Tribune, 1 March 1925, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

To direct the museum, the association hired J. Nilsen Laurvik, a New York art critic who had written a book on modern art in 1913 and co-edited the Catalogue de Luxe of the PPIE Department of Fine Arts. SFAA printed letterhead bearing the title "San Francisco Museum of Art" and in November 1916 began publishing the ''San Francisco Art Association Bulletin'', intended as an annual journal. The Crockers formed committees within SFAA and filled the positions with successful businessmen. A shift in focus occurred in which traditional patronage practices came to the fore‚Äîthe aesthetic wishes of the corporate class began to affect the artists' choices in subject matter and style.&lt;ref name=Lee1999/&gt; Against best intentions, attendance at the Palace of Fine Arts was too light to prevent heavy operating losses of $10,000‚Äì14,000 each year from 1915 to 1922, and the collection of public art remained small, overwhelmed by the vast space.&lt;ref name=Lee1999&gt;{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Anthony W. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRQl90nXXCoC |title=Painting on the Left: Diego Rivera, radical politics, and San Francisco's public murals |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |pages=30‚Äì35 |isbn=0-520-21977-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landscape painting, once the strength of SFAA fell off in volume. By the mid-1920s, only one modest landscape by reliably compliant [[Arthur Frank Mathews]] was being shown at the Palace.&lt;ref name=Lee1999/&gt;

SFAA promoted a series of civic bond issues in the mid-1920s, written to fund new museums. Work began on the [[California Palace of the Legion of Honor|Palace of the Legion of Honor]], a favorite project of SFAA member [[Herbert Fleishhacker]].&lt;ref name=Lee1999/&gt; Large murals began to appear in public spaces, painted by SFAA artists, and were favorably reviewed by art critics and the public alike. A combination of corporate class patronage, CSFA mural training and years of private experience came together to allow the mural artists to succeed.&lt;ref name=Lee1999/&gt; In 1924, the [[M. H. de Young Memorial Museum|de Young Museum]] was voted a civic maintenance program, the Legion of Honor museum was finished, and in 1926, a bond was passed to reinforce the weakening Palace of Fine Arts structure.&lt;ref name=Lee1999/&gt; Three public museums were available to San Franciscans.

SFAA's own museum operated in the Palace of Fine Arts until 1925. After much fundraising and a bond measure, the San Francisco Museum of Art reopened in the [[War Memorial Veterans Building]] in the Civic Center in January 1935. The opening exhibitions included the SFAA Annual, Gothic and Renaissance tapestries from the collection of Mrs. William H. Crocker, 46 examples of "Modern French Painting" that included C√©zannes and Renoirs, and Chinese sculpture which was "to remain at the museum as the nucleus of a permanent display of Oriental art."&lt;ref&gt;''San Francisco Art Association Bulletin'', January 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert M. Bender]] was a member of the Board of Trustees at the time and is said to have donated some 1100 of the first 1200 objects in the collection. The museum's governance was separate from that of SFAA, but a cooperative relationship between the two entities continued for years.

==Merger and dissolution==
In 1961, SFAA merged with CSFA, and the art school took its modern name, the [[San Francisco Art Institute]]. The SFAA was officially dissolved in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/collection/sanfraaa.htm San Francisco Art Association|Smithsonian Archives of American Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shalom Koboshvili''' (b. [[Akhaltsikhe]], 1876, d. [[Tbilisi]] 1941) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n [[artist]] who specialised in drawings and paintings of [[Jew]]ish life in Georgia.

Born to a poor family of Jews in Akhaltsikhe, Koboshvili was originally intended for the [[Rabbi]]nate, but quit religious training at an early age.  His interest in art was  discouraged by his family, and he was originally apprenticed as a printer. All his knowledge of art was effectively self-taught. After a varied career (in which around 1910 he is said to have met with the artist [[Niko Pirosmani]])&lt;ref&gt;Tsitsuashvili (2006), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; he eventually became in 1937 a watchman at the newly established [[David Baazov Museum of History of Jews of Georgia|Jewish Historic-Ethnographic Museum]] in Tbilisi. His work there apparently inspired him to devote himself to painting and all his surviving work dates from the period 1937-1941, the year of his death.

Koboshvili's work, which is all in a competent but [[Naive art|naive]] style, is entirely devoted to scenes of Jewish life; sometimes painted in oils, sometimes in water colours on paper. There are scenes relating to Jewish marriages, to Jewish festivals (including [[Succot]] and [[Yom Kippur]]), and to scenes of Jewish life in Georgian villages and on Jewish [[kolkhoz|collective farms]].

The Georgian Jewish Museum was forcibly closed in the 1950s and its contents, including  the works of Koboshvili, were transferred to the [[National Museum of Georgia]], to which they still belong. A retrospective exhibition of the works of Koboshvili was held at the Museum in Tbilisi in 2006.

The '''''Spoliarium''''' (often misspelled ''Spolarium'') is a painting by [[Filipino people|Filipino]] painter [[Juan Luna]]. The painting was submitted by Luna to the ''Exposici√≥n Nacional de Bellas Artes'' in 1884 in [[Madrid]], where it garnered the first gold medal (out of three).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1884/164/A00694-00694.pdf Gaceta de Madrid, no. 164, 12/06/1884, p. 694]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, it was sold to the ''Diputaci√≥n Provincial de Barcelona'' for 20,000 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]]. It currently hangs in the main gallery at the ground floor of the [[National Museum of Fine Arts (Manila)|National Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Manila]], and is the first work of art that greets visitors upon entry into the museum. The picture recreates a despoiling scene in a [[Circus (building)|Roman circus]] where dead [[gladiator]]s are stripped of weapons and garments.

Luna, working on [[canvas]], spent eight months completing the painting which depicts dying gladiators. Filipino historian [[Ambeth Ocampo]] writes, "...the fact remains that when Luna and F√©lix Resurrecci√≥n Hidalgo won the top awards in the Madrid Exposition of 1884, they proved to the world that ''indios'' could, despite their supposed barbarian race, paint better than the Spaniards who colonized them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Ocampo | first =Ambeth R. | title =Rizal Without the Overcoat | publisher =Anvil Publishing | year = 2000 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Jose Rizal and the Spoliarium ==
At a gathering of Filipino expatriates in Madrid, [[Jose Rizal]] enthusiastically toasted the triumphs his two compatriots had achieved, the other being [[F√©lix Resurrecci√≥n Hidalgo|F√©lix Hidalgo]] who won a silver medal, calling it "fresh proof of racial equality".&lt;ref name=guerrero1974&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guerrero|first1=Leon |title=The First Filipino: A Biography of Jos√© Rizal |date=1974 |publisher=National Historical Commission |location=Manila |page=112 |edition=5th |url=http://www.xeniaeditrice.it/firstfilipinoocrpdf.pdf |accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Luna's ''Spoliarium'' with its bloody carcasses  of slave gladiators being dragged away from the arena where they had entertained their Roman oppressors with their lives... stripped to satisfy the lewd contempt of their Roman persecutors with their honor...."{{sfn|Guerrero|1974|p=114}} Rizal was footnoted  in his speech that the ''Spoliarium'', "embodied the essence of our social, moral and political life: humanity in severe ordeal, humanity unredeemed, reason and idealism in open struggle with prejudice, fanaticism and injustice."{{sfn|Guerrero|1974|p=114}}

Rizal was inspired to carve a mark of his own to give glory to his country by writing his 'Spoliarium' since early that year 1884 "he had been toying with the idea of a book" for he has seen and described the painting as "the tumult of the crowd, the shouts of slaves, the metallic clatter of dead men's armor, the sobs of orphans, the murmured prayers...." Rizal's book would be called ''[[Noli me tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'', "the Latin echo of the Spoliarium".{{sfn|Guerrero|1974|p=119-120, 122}}

== In popular culture ==
[[Ryan Cayabyab]] composed the opera ''Spoliarium'', which chronicles the creation of the eponymous painting and Juan Luna's trial for the murder of his wife. Soprano Fides Cuyugan-Asensio wrote the [[libretto]]. A recorded version was released for commercial distribution in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26967">'''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures''' are toys based on the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|franchise of the same name]] and have been produced by the company [[Playmates (Toy Company)|Playmates Toys]] since 1988. Staff artists at the [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] based [[Mirage Studios]] have provided conceptual designs for many of the figures, vehicles, and playsets and are credited on the packaging of the products they created.

==Getting started==
The first TMNT license came in the form of a [[role-playing game]] by [[Palladium Books|Palladium]], followed by miniatures from [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]]. Within a year, [[First Comics]] began to reprint the early issues in color volumes; four were produced, stopping at issue 11. These sold well, and Eastman and Laird were soon contacted by Mark Freedman, a licensing agent who believed he could make something of the Turtles. Freedman took the idea to a variety of toy companies, only to be turned down by those who felt the concept was not popular enough to support a toy line. Only one company expressed interest, a little-known California company by the name of Playmates. The illustrations you see here are designed by toy designer T. Mark Taylor who designed the first Turtle toy line and created additional new chararachters  like ‚Äú Rock Steady, BeBop , The Foot ‚Äú.  The Party Wagon, The Blimp, And others.

Not entirely willing to risk marketing a small [[cult following|cult]] comic book, Playmates insisted that a cartoon series be produced first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmnt25.com/turtle_power/about_the_creators.html#4 About the Creators] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420143103/http://www.tmnt25.com/turtle_power/about_the_creators.html#4 |date=2009-04-20 }} TMNT25.com (January 2009). Retrieved on 1-31-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Development initiated with a creative team of companies and individuals: Jerry Sachs, famous ad man of Sachs-Finley Agency, brought together the animators at Murakami-Wolf-Swenson, headed by award-winning animator Fred Wolf. Wolf and his team combined concepts and ideas with Playmates marketing crew, headed by Karl Aaronian and then VP of Sales, Richard Sallis and President of Playmates, Bill Carlson. Aaronian brought on several designers and concepteer and writer John Schulte and worked out the simple backstory that would live on toy packaging for the entire run of the product and show. Sachs called the high-concept pitch "Green Against Brick". The sense of humor was honed with the collaboration of MWS's writers, Walk Kubiak, Aaronian, Schulte and Sachs. Playmates and their team essentially served as associate producers and contributing writers to the miniseries that was first launch to sell-in the toy action figures. Phrases like "Heroes in a Half Shell" and many of the comical catch phrases and battle slogans ("Turtle Power!") came from the writing and conceptualization of this creative team. As the series developed, veteran writer Jack Mendelsohn came on board as both a story editor and scriptwriter. David Wise, Michael Charles Hill and Michael Reaves wrote most of the scripts, taking input via Mendelsohn and collaborating writer Schulte and marketing maven Aaronian. In signing with [[Murakami-Wolf-Swenson|Murakami-Wolf-Swenson Productions]], Eastman and Laird saw the production of the first [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|TMNT cartoon]] in December 1987. Playmates held up their end of the deal and produced the first series of TMNT action figures in the summer of 1988. The premiere series included the four Turtles, [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], [[April O'Neil|April]], [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]], [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Rocksteady]], [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Bebop]], and a [[Foot Clan|Foot Soldier]]. Vehicles included the Cheapskate, Turtle Trooper, Turtle Blimp, and Foot Knucklehead. Each vehicle set was packaged with a jokebook and a small catalog. If one was to clip the "Pizza Point"s located on the reverse side of the packaging then a person could redeem them along with a small fee for other Turtles merchandise like VHS tapes, posters, bath towels, among others. Corresponding firmly with its animated series counterpart, the original TMNT action figure line would last ten years and develop a legacy within the toy realm.

==Overview==
The first three series of figures took obvious influence from the original Mirage comics. The Turtles lacked pupils and had bulging muscles with large veins. The blister card art was also very unrefined and reflected the comics; in fact, Shredder's pose was based directly on art from the debut issue. Each figure had at least 7 points of articulation (neck, shoulders, wrists, hips), many accessories including the characters signature weapon, and a bio card on the back of the blister package that kids could cut out and collect. Also included was a fully illustrated origin story on the card's backside which was phased out during the 4th series. The figures boasted highly detailed sculpting, especially for the time. Colorful characters like General Traag, Rat King, Mutagen man, Scumbug, Pizza Face, Muckman, and many others featured intricate details such as small animals crawling over them, large scars, torn clothing, and pieces of garbage stuck to their bodies.

With the release of the second series in 1989, fans saw ten entirely new figures: five allies and five enemies, six new vehicles/accessories, the first playset, the Turtle Battle Fun role-play sets, 9" and 13" plush dolls, and official Retromutagen Ooze. This year also marked the first time Playmates would incorporate action features into their figures along with the first Turtle variants in the "Wacky Action" sub-line. Each figure possessed a wind-up function that, when applied, caused the figure's limbs to rapidly move in a rhythmic motion.

''Wacky Action'' was merely the tip of the iceberg, however, as the new decade of the 1990s dawned ''Talkin' Turtles'', ''Head Droppin' Turtles'', ''Mutations'', ''Sewer Sports Turtles'', and dozens of other fresh ideas began making their way to toy shelves. With such innovations, Ninja Turtle action figures were sure to gain a foothold in the toy market.

===Vehicles/accessories===
Considering all of the vehicles and inventions conceived by [[Donatello (TMNT)|Donatello]], Playmates couldn't have their figures without a slew of toy gadgetry to interact with. Aside from vehicles actually seen in the cartoon, Playmates went on to create a wide variety other accessories. These often expressed the humorous side of TMNT with gadgets commonly made out of sewer lids, trash cans, plungers, and toilet seats. However, vehicles would also include a diversity of play features from the ripcord action of the Psycho Cycle to the electronic launching of the Turtle Pizza Thrower to the smoky bubble spout of the Bubble Bomber. For its time, TMNT was remarkably innovative in terms of fun action figure accessories.

In the midst of action figures filling the store shelves, role playing toys were also released. Depending on the depicted character, these typically included a ninja mask and plastic weapons. Other TMNT toys would be sold individually such as the Turtle Communicator, Raphael's Spy goggles, and Leo's Sewer Force Sword.

One of the most famous components of the TMNT realm is the [[radioactive]] slime Retromutagen Ooze, which mutated the Ninja Turtles from common house pets to "mean, green, fightin' machines." Thus, even Ooze was produced for the interaction with TMNT figures in 1989. The green slime was sold in a small container which also included a [[Phosphorescence|glow-in-the-dark]] Ninja Turtle in mid-mutation.  Aside from the classic "Turtle Green," a "Purple Foot" variation would also become available in 1993. Ooze was an essential component to playsets such as the Flushomatic, and action figures like [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters#Muckman|Muckman]], who could have it run from his hollow head and out his mouth. Depending on their features, occasional figures and accessories came with their own smaller canister of Ooze to fulfill the playtime experience.

==Themes and incarnations==
Throughout the 1990s, Ninja Turtle action figures would run an extensive gauntlet of different themes and incarnations. Whereas [[Batman action figures|Batman]] may have become known for hundreds of gadget-wielding action figures, just as well, the Ninja Turtles would become synonymous with dozens of historical and pop culture related embodiments. Varying concepts and toy trends resulted in the many examples shown below.

*Basic series figures taking on various looks; Leo, the Sewer Samurai, Don, the Undercover Turtle, Mike, the Sewer Surfer, and Raph, the [[Space Cadet]]. (1990) Also released with the basic line were the four turtles with Storage Shell. Each action figure had an opening back shell which could store the various accessories each figure was packaged with. Donatello would be released in 1990 and the remaining three the following year.
*''Mutant [[United States military|Military]]'' - Different forms of military - [[Lieutenant]] Leo, Pro [[aviator|Pilot]] Don, [[Midshipman]] Mike, and Raph, the [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Teen Beret]]. (1991)
*''[[rock 'n' roll|Rock'n Rollin']]'' - Vibrant musical gimmicks; [[classic rock|Classic Rocker]] Leo, [[punk rock|Punker]] Don, [[hip hop music|Rappin']] Mike, and [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] Raph. (1991)
*''Sewer Sports All-Stars'' - Sport-themed figures with action features; Among others, [[American football|T.D. Tossin']] Leo, [[basketball|Slam Dunkin']] Don, [[professional wrestling|Shell Slammin']] Mike, and [[baseball|Grand Slammin']] Raph. (1991)
*''Wacky Wild West'' - The Ninja Turtles taking on the [[Old West]]; [[Native Americans in the United States|Chief]] Leo, Crazy [[Cowboy]] Don, Bandito-Bashin' Mike, and Sewer Scout Raph.(1992)
*''Cave-Turtles'' - [[Stone Age]] "Collectible Turtle Combo" boxsets; Among others, Leo and his [[Triceratops|Dingy Dino]], Don and his Trippy [[Tyrannosaurus]], Mike and his Silly [[Stegosaurus]], and Raph and his Tubular [[Pterodactyl]]. (1992-'93)
*''Turtle [[troll#troll dolls|Trolls]]'' - A take on the early 1990s troll doll craze; Leo, Don, Mike, and Raph featuring tall, synthetic hair and childlike appearances. (1993)
*''[[Universal Studios]] Monsters'' - Classic monster-themed figures; Among others, Leo as the [[Werewolf|Wolfman]], Don as [[Dracula]], Mike as [[Frankenstein]]'s monster, Raph as the [[Mummy]], and [[Bride of Frankenstein]] April. (1993-'94)
*''[[Star Trek]]'' - A crossover due to Playmates' owning both ''Star Trek'' and TMNT licenses; [[Captain (Star Trek)|Captain]] Leonardo, [[First Officer (Star Trek)]] Don, [[Chief Engineer]] Michelangelo, and [[Chief Medical Officer (Star Trek)|Chief Medical Officer]] Raphael. (1994)
*''Adventurers'' - Figures dressed for adventuring; Deep Sea Diver Leonardo, [[Arctic]] Donatello, and [[Safari]] Michelangelo. (1995)
*''[[Jim Lee]]'s TMNT'' - Majorly restyled Ninja Turtle figures based on the designs of famous [[comic book artist]] Jim Lee. (1995)
*''Mutant Masters'' - The Ninja Turtles sporting [[Anime]] inspired armor as "ancient mythic warriors"; Leonardo Wind Warrior, Donatello Water Warrior, Michelangelo Thunder Warrior, and Raphael Fire Warrior. (1997)

Even with the silliest of concepts, Playmates managed to create some intriguing and fun figure designs for children. In contrast to other companies like [[Kenner Products|Kenner]], who constantly re-released figure sculpts with different paint jobs, Playmates rarely showed a cheap or careless effort in their TMNT figures. But with rising competition, limited figure concepts, and the end of the cartoon series, a pitfall was inevitable.

===''Movie Stars'' and ''Toon Turtles''===
By the second, less violent TMNT film, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'', Playmates decided to create a figure collection based on the characters' live-action appearance. In contrast to the regular figures, these were made of a softer, more rubbery material to better reflect the look of the [[animatronic]] costumes used in the films. They also featured ball joints at the neck, shoulders, and hips, and each figure came with a small, canister of Ooze.  In terms of character variety, however, the ''Movie Stars'' collections were in stark contrast to the wide variety seen in the basic figure lines.

1992 also saw the production of ''Toon Turtles''. These figures took on an almost [[stereotypical]] approach to being humorously cartoon-like.  Each character bore a friendly, animated appearance with a glittery paint job and including some type of "cartoon" action feature (Raphael's head spun, Michelangelo's tongue unraveled in [[Tex Avery]] fashion, etc.). On the upside, this series produced a more "cartoon accurate" painted version of Shredder and introduced toys not previously made for many longtime characters from the cartoon series such as the Neutrinos and April O'Neil's co-workers, [[Irma Langinstein]], [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters#Burne Thompson|Burne Thompson]] and [[Vernon Fenwick]].

A third movie hit theatres in 1993 but saw less success than its predecessors.  This collection featured the Ninja Turtles once again in their ''Movie Star'' likeness and sporting [[samurai]] armor, as well as several other side characters. The ''Giant Movie III Samurai'' figures also came complete with removable masks and time [[scepter]]s as seen in the film.

===Mini Mutants===
In 1994, Playmates, in an attempt capitalize on toy lines like [[Mighty Max (toyline)|Mighty Max]] and [[Polly Pocket]], shrunk the Turtles down to an equally small size in a sub-line simply named "Mini Mutants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmnttoys.com/figures1987.html#88 |title=Mini-Mutants |publisher=Tmnttoys.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were "Turtle Transport Combos" which contained one figure and two vehicles. "Bodacious Battlesets" which were four playsets which could connect via bridges/platforms; these included one figure. "Turtle Top Playsets" were a characters head which would open into a double decker playset; these included three figures. Slimmer "Carry Along Playsets" took the shape of Raph's sai, Leo's katana, and the Turtle Communicator; these came with three figures. And finally, "Turtle in a Turtle" consisted of four playsets that were figures of the four turtles about 6&amp;nbsp;inches taller than the normal figure; their heads, stomachs, and shells opened into the playsets. Each had themed removable armor as well; two figures were included with each.

==Unproduced toys==

The original Ninja Turtle line ran for almost ten years and, in that time, various planned items would ultimately not hit toy shelves. Some of these went as far as the prototype stage and being presented at New York Toy Fairs; others had only designs drawn.

==Advertising==
TMNT action figure [[TV commercials|commercials]] that started with the first series featured clips from the cartoon and narration describing the figures which were shown in incredible "toy size" environments. This also went for vehicles and playsets. The scenes from the show were overdubbed with dialogue usually from the actual voice actors that went along with story in the ad.

During post movie success, many commercials relied on live-action, animatronic Ninja Turtles similar to those seen in the "Coming Out of their Shells" Tour. Prime examples of these include 1992 spots for the Bubble Bomber vehicle featuring Raphael in military fatigues and ''Bodacious Birthday'' figures where a surprise party was thrown in the Turtles' sewer lair.

==1996‚Äì1998: Dry spell==
By 1996, the cartoon series that lasted nearly a decade had come to an end. The following year, a new live-action series premiered entitled ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]''. The series was somewhat short-lived but managed to make for an extensive action figure line. Alongside the basic TMNT characters, this collection of taller scale figures included a female Ninja Turtle named [[Venus (TMNT)|Venus]]. The show's demise, however, would further confirm the dissolving popularity of the Ninja Turtles, and the franchise would remain in limbo for years to come. Left with a disappointing movie four years past and virtually no place on television, the TMNT franchise would face a halt in action figure production for several years.

==2003‚Äì2012==
On February 8, 2003, Fox revived the TMNT franchise with a brand new [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|cartoon series]].  With it inevitably came a series of action figures.  These figures showed reminiscence of those released in 1988 yet with the refreshed design of the new, bold look of the cartoon series. Unlike the previous figures, most of the figures released in this collection actually appeared in the 2003 series. This collection successfully continued into 2006 with new character designs and even an occasional revisiting of past concepts like 1993's ''Cave-Turtles''. In 2006, by request of Playmates, the cartoon series took a new lighter direction which brought ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward]]'', a futuristic take on the heroic mutants. Playmates thought of this change as a means of selling more new Turtles action figures.

March 2007 introduced fans to a new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] feature film entitled simply [[TMNT (film)|''TMNT'']]. This introduced the Ninja Turtles on-screen to a new generation and corresponded with an extensive action figure line. New figures based on the film continued to be produced into the following year.

In September 2007, it was announced that the collectible figure company [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]] had acquired the license to produce Ninja Turtle figures based on their character likenesses from the original Mirage comic books. The first wave of figures consisted of the four Turtles and was released in comic and specialty stores in early 2008. The New York Comic Con also boasted an exclusive figure four-pack, and that same year, NECA released black &amp; white versions of the Turtles just as they appeared in the pages of the comics.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, Jay [http://toynewsi.com/news.php?catid=20&amp;itemid=12381 Black &amp; White Teenage Mutant Turtle Figures Coming From NECA] TNI News (January 23, 2008). Retrieved on 1-30-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, to commemorate the Turtles' 25th anniversary, Playmates re-released the first series of figures c. 1988, plus [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles supporting characters#Slash|Slash]] and the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)#Vehicles and gadgetry|Party Wagon]]. Each figure comes packaged with vintage card art and a DVD containing one episode of the 1987 cartoon series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailydrop.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-25th-anniversary-action-figures Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 25th Anniversary Action Figures] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090131065343/http://www.dailydrop.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-25th-anniversary-action-figures |date=2009-01-31 }} DailyDrop.com (January 28, 2009). Retrieved on 1-30-09.&lt;/ref&gt; A separate series of totally new designs was also planned but not released by Playmates. These figures are based on early Mirage comics and include Splinter, Shredder, and a Foot Soldier among the four Turtles in red apparel. These turtles were first unveiled in the Nintendo Power magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Gimmick, Newton [http://www.infinitehollywood.com/2009/10/tmnt-products-from-playmates-not-dead.html] Infinite Hollywood( Monday, October 5, 2009).

'''''The Conversion of Saint Bavo''''' is a 1623-1624 altarpiece by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. It was commissioned as the high altarpiece for [[Sint-Baafskathedraal]] in [[Ghent]] by bishop [[Antoon Triest]] (1577-1657). It is still sited in the cathedral. An oil sketch for it is now in the [[National Gallery, London]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/peter-paul-rubens-oil-sketch-for-high-altarpiece-st-bavo-ghent&lt;/ref&gt;

'''UnFrame''' collective is an independent resource of documentary photography exclusively managed by an international group of photographers dedicated to shining the spotlight on social, political and everyday issues that surround us. The collective was founded in February 2013 with the aim of developing and working on both long term social and political issues with a deeper perspective in addition to responding to news events as they happen anywhere in the world.

== Documented events ==
In 2013, during the first year of its activity, events documented were:

* The [[Rana Plaza]] building collapse in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]].
* The [[2013 protests in Turkey]].
* The consequences on civilians of the troubled political season in [[Bangladesh]].
* The [[Ukraine]] political crisis, the Kiev revolution ([[Euromaidan]]) and the Russian occupation of Crimea.

== Issues ==
The photographers have organized a collective archive of long term issues. Amongst others are the following:

* The aftermath of the [[Arab Spring]] in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].
* Three years of civil unrest and economic hardship in [[Italy]].
* The social consequences of the political division of [[Cyprus]].
* The social conditions of the [[Romani people|Roma]] in Europe.

Starting from September 2013 UnFrame self manages the collectives' growing archives in order to best facilitate the syndication of its work in the most efficient way possible. To this effect it has also partnered with key resource media outlets allowing for the distribution of its photographs including the French photo agency Cosmos.

The '''Western canon''' is the body of [[Western literature]], [[European classical music]], philosophy, and [[works of art]] that represents the [[high culture]] of Europe and North America: "a certain Western intellectual tradition that goes from, say, [[Socrates]] to [[Wittgenstein]] in philosophy, and from [[Homer]] to [[James Joyce]] in literature".&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt;  The word [[wikt:canon|canon]] is derived from ancient Greek ''Œ∫Œ±ŒΩœéŒΩ, kan·πìn'', meaning a measuring rod, or standard. The [[Bible]], a product of [[ancient Jewish]] culture, from western Asia, has been a major force in shaping [[Western culture]], and "has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought, literature, and art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Bible: A Very Short Introduction|edition= |last= Riches|first= John|year= 2000|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-285343-1|page= 134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The canon of books has been fairly stable, although it has expanded to include more women and [[racial minorities]], while the canons of music and the visual arts have greatly expanded to cover the [[Middle Ages]] and subsequent centuries once largely overlooked. But some examples of newer media such as [[Film|cinema]] have attained a precarious position in the canon. Also during the twentieth century there has been a growing interest in the West as well as globally, in major works, both in literature and in the other arts, of the cultures of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South America and the former colonies of European countries.

There has been an ongoing debate internationally, over the nature and status of the canon since at least the 1960s, much of which is rooted in [[critical theory]], [[feminism]], [[critical race theory]], and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="Hicks 2004 p. 18"&gt;[[Stephen Hicks|Hicks, Stephen]]. (2004). ''Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault''. Scholargy Press, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[postmodern]] studies have argued that the body of scholarship is [[bias]]ed because the traditional main focus of academic studies of [[Western culture]] and history has only been on works produced by Western [[Patriarchy|men]].

==A classic==
[[Image:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|100ox|thumb|In painting, the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], c. 1503‚Äì1506, is the archetypal masterpiece, though it was not produced for admission to a guild or academy.]]
A [[classic]] is a book, or any other work of art, accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy, for example through an [[imprimatur]] such as being listed in a list of [[great books]], or through a reader's personal opinion. Although the term is often associated with the Western canon, it can be applied to works of literature, music and art, etc. from all traditions, such as the [[Chinese classics]] or the [[Veda]]s. A related word is [[masterpiece]] or ''chef d'≈ìuvre'', which in modern use refers to a creation that has been given much critical praise, especially one that is considered the greatest work of a person's career or to a work of outstanding creativity, skill, or workmanship. Historically, the word refers to a work of a very high standard produced in order to obtain membership of a [[Guild]] or [[Academy]].

The first writer to use the term "classic" was [[Aulus Gellius]], a 2nd-century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writer who, in the [[miscellany]] ''Noctes Atticae'' (19, 8, 15), refers to a writer as a ''classicus scriptor, non proletarius'' ("A distinguished, not a commonplace writer"). Such classification began with the Greeks' ''ranking'' their cultural works, with the word ''[[wikt:canon|canon]]'' (ancient Greek Œ∫Œ±ŒΩœéŒΩ, kan·πìn: "measuring rod, standard"). Moreover, early [[Christianity|Christian]] Church Fathers used ''canon'' to rank the authoritative texts of the [[New Testament]], preserving them, given the expense of [[vellum]] and [[papyrus]] and mechanical book reproduction, thus, being comprehended in a ''canon'' ensured a book's preservation as the best way to retain information about a civilization.&lt;ref name="Gellius"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gellius |first1=Aulus |title=Auli Gellii Noctes Atticae: ex editione Jacobi Gronovii, cum notis et interpretatione in usum Delphini, variis lectionibus, notis variorum, recensu editionum et codicum, et indice locupletissimo, accurate recensitae |date=1824 |publisher=curante et imprimente A.J. Valpy, A.M. |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=sc5GAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=5 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/auligelliinocte02gellgoog/page/n3 |archivedate=March 25, 2008|language=la}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporarily, the Western canon defines the best of [[Western culture]]. In the ancient world, at the [[Alexandrian Library]], scholars coined the Greek term ''Hoi enkrithentes'' ("the admitted", "the included") to identify the writers in the canon.

==Literary canon (mainly)==

===Classic book===
{{List to table|date=November 2018}}
{{main article|Classic book|Great books}}
With regard to books, what makes a book "classic" has concerned various authors, from [[Mark Twain]] to [[Italo Calvino]], and questions such as "Why Read the Classics?", and "What Is a Classic?" have been considered by others, including Calvino, [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]], [[Michael Dirda]], and [[Ezra Pound]].

The terms "classic book" and Western canon are closely related concepts, but are not necessarily synonymous. A "canon" is a list of books considered to be "essential", and it can be published as a collection (such as [[Great Books of the Western World]], [[Modern Library]], [[Everyman's Library]], or [[Penguin Classics]]), presented as a list with an academic's imprimatur (such as [[Harold Bloom]]'s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bloom, Harold|title= The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|location= New York|publisher= Harcourt Brace &amp; Company|date= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or be the official reading list of a university.

Some of the writers who are generally considered the most important in [[Western literature]] are [[Homer]], [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], [[Euripides]], [[Aristophanes]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]],  [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[Dante Alighieri]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Fran√ßois Rabelais]], [[Jean Racine]], [[Moli√®re]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[John Milton]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Stendhal]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Honor√© de Balzac]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Herman Melville]], [[George Eliot]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[James Joyce]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[T.S. Eliot]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Fernando Pessoa]], [[Albert Camus]] and [[Samuel Beckett]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bloom]], ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages]]'', 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Tucker|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,304173,00.html|title=Book Review: 'The Western Canon: The Books and the School of the Ages'; Books|work=EW.com|date=21 October 1994|accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold Bloom]] has divided the body of Western Literature into four ages&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonic.net/~rteeter/grtbloom.html|title=Bloom. Western Canon|first=Teeter,|last=Robert|date=|website=sonic.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

**United States; e.g. ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' ([[Mark Twain]]) and ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' ([[Herman Melville]])

A university or college [[Great Books]] Program is a program inspired by the Great Books movement begun in the United States in the 1920s by Prof. [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]] of [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalacademy.com/adlerlowelllec.htm |title=radicalacademy.com |publisher=radicalacademy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed to improve the higher education system by returning it to the western [[liberal arts]] tradition of broad cross-disciplinary learning. These academics and educators included [[Robert Hutchins]], [[Mortimer Adler]], [[Stringfellow Barr]], [[Scott Buchanan]], [[Jacques Barzun]], and [[Alexander Meiklejohn]]. The view among them was that the emphasis on narrow specialization in American colleges had harmed the quality of [[higher education]] by failing to expose students to the important products of Western civilization and thought.

The essential component of such programs is a high degree of engagement with primary texts, called the Great Books. The curricula of Great Books programs often follow a canon of texts considered more or less essential to a student's education, such as Plato's ''Republic'', or Dante's ''Divine Comedy''. Such programs often focus exclusively on Western culture. Their employment of primary texts dictates an interdisciplinary approach, as most of the Great Books do not fall neatly under the prerogative of a single contemporary academic discipline. Great Books programs often include designated discussion groups as well as lectures, and have small class sizes. In general students in such programs receive an abnormally high degree of attention from their professors, as part of the overall aim of fostering a community of learning.

Over 100 institutions of higher learning, mostly in the United States, offer some version of a Great Books Program as an option for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casement|first=William|title=College Great Books Programs|url=http://www.coretexts.org/college-great-books-programs/#tz|publisher=The Association for Core Texts and Courses (ACTC)|accessdate=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate===
{{anchor|Dead white men}}
There has been an ongoing debate, especially in the US, over the nature and status of the canon since at least the 1960s, much of which is rooted in [[critical theory]], [[feminism]], [[critical race theory]], and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="Hicks 2004 p. 18"/&gt; In particular, [[postmodern]] studies have argued that the body of scholarship is biased, because the main focus traditionally of the academic studies of history and [[Western culture]] has only been on Europe and men. American philosopher [[Jay Stevenson]] argues:
:[In] the postmodern period [‚Ä¶] [t]raditional literature has been found to have been written by "dead white males" to serve the ''ideological'' aims of a conservative and repressive Anglo ''hegemony'' [‚Ä¶] In an array of reactions against the race, gender, and class biases found to be woven into the tradition of Anglo lit, multicultural writers and political literary theorists have sought to expose, resist, and redress injustices and prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jay Stevenson|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to English Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SoL1Di1HRBIC&amp;pg=PA9|year=2007|publisher=Alpha Books|pages=9‚Äì10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classicist]] [[Bernard Knox]] made direct reference to this topic when he delivered his 1992 [[Jefferson Lecture]] (the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]]).&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lecturers] at NEH Website (retrieved May 25, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Knox used the intentionally "provocative" title "The Oldest Dead White European Males"&lt;ref&gt;Nadine Drozan, [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/06/style/chronicle-879492.html  "Chronicle"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 6, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; as the title of his lecture and his subsequent book of the same name, in both of which Knox defended the continuing relevance of [[Classics|classical]] culture to modern society.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Knox, ''The Oldest Dead White European Males and Other Reflections on the Classics'' (1993) (reprint, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1994), {{ISBN|978-0-393-31233-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lehmann"&gt;[[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/29/books/books-of-the-times-putting-in-a-word-for-homer-herodotus-plato-etc.html "Books of The Times; Putting In a Word for Homer, Herodotus, Plato, Etc."], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 29, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some intellectuals have championed a "high conservative modernism" that insists that universal truths exist, and have opposed approaches that deny the existence of universal truths.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald J. Russello, ''The Postmodern Imagination of Russell Kirk'' (2007) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Many argued that "[[natural law]]" was the repository of timeless truths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyrum S. Lewis|title=Sacralizing the Right: William F.

Bloom further comments: "But one thing is certain: wherever the Great Books make up a central part of the curriculum, the students are excited and satisfied."&lt;ref&gt;Allan Bloom (2008), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; His book was widely cited by some intellectuals for its argument that the classics contained universal truths and timeless values which were being ignored by [[cultural relativism|cultural relativists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Keith Booker|title=Encyclopedia of Literature and Politics: A‚ÄìG|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcFC4oiDmpgC&amp;pg=PA180|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood|pages=180‚Äì81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Williams, ed. ''PC wars: Politics and theory in the academy'' (Routledge, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yale University]] Professor of Humanities and famous literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] (no relation) has also argued strongly in favor of the canon, in his 1994 book ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages]]'',  and in general the canon remains as a represented idea in many institutions,&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt; though its implications continue to be debated.

Defenders maintain that those who undermine the canon do so out of primarily political interests, and that such criticisms are misguided and/or disingenuous. As [[John Searle]], Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, has written:
{{Quote|There is a certain irony in this [i.e., politicized objections to the canon] in that earlier student generations, my own for example, found the critical tradition that runs from [[Socrates]] through the [[The Federalist Papers|''Federalist Papers'']], through the writings of [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]], down to the twentieth century, to be liberating from the stuffy conventions of traditional American politics and pieties. Precisely by inculcating a critical attitude, the "canon" served to demythologize the conventional pieties of the American bourgeoisie and provided the student with a perspective from which to critically analyze American culture and institutions. Ironically, the same tradition is now regarded as oppressive. The texts once served an unmasking function; now we are told that it is the texts which must be unmasked.&lt;ref name="Searle"&gt;Searle, John. (1990) "The Storm Over the University", ''The New York Review of Books'', December 6, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the main objections to a canon of literature is the question of authority; who should have the power to determine what works are worth reading? Searle's rebuttal suggests that "one obvious difficulty with it [i.e., arguments against hierarchical ranking of books] is that if it were valid, it would argue against any set of required readings whatever; indeed, any list you care to make about anything automatically creates two categories, those that are on the list and those that are not."&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt;

[[Charles Altieri]], of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], states that canons are "an institutional form for exposing people to a range of idealized attitudes." It is according to this notion that work may be removed from the canon over time to reflect the contextual relevance and thoughts of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-literary-canon.htm|title=What is a Literary Canon? (with pictures)|author=|date=|website=wisegeek.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; American historian [[Todd M. Compton]] argues that canons are always communal in nature; that there are limited canons for, say a literature survey class, or an English department reading list, but there is no such thing as one absolute canon of literature. Instead, there are many conflicting canons. He regards Bloom's "Western Canon" as a personal canon only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toddmcompton.com/infinitecanonsprint.htm Compton, "''Infinite Canons: A Few Axioms and Questions, and in Addition, a Proposed Definition. A response to Harold Bloom''"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of defining the boundaries of the canon is endless. The philosopher [[John Searle]] has said, "In my experience there never was, in fact, a fixed 'canon'; there was rather a certain set of tentative judgments about what had importance and quality. Such judgments are always subject to revision, and in fact they were constantly being revised."&lt;ref name="Searle"/&gt; One of the notable attempts at compiling an authoritative canon for literature in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world was the ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]'' program. This program, developed in the middle third of the 20th century, grew out of the curriculum at the [[University of Chicago]]. University president [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] and his collaborator [[Mortimer Adler]] developed a program that offered reading lists, books, and organizational strategies for reading clubs to the general public.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} An earlier attempt had been made in 1909 by [[Harvard University]] president [[Charles W. Eliot]], with the [[Harvard Classics]], a 51-volume anthology of classic works from world literature. Eliot's view was the same as that of Scottish philosopher and historian [[Thomas Carlyle]]: "The true University of these days is a Collection of Books". ("The Hero as Man of Letters", 1840)

===In the English-speaking world===

==== British renaissance poetry ====

{{main article|Elizabethan literature|Metaphysical poets}}
The canon of Renaissance English poetry of the 16th and early 17th century has always been in some form of flux and towards the end of the 20th century the established canon was criticized, especially by those who wished to expand it to include, for example, more women writers.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waller|first1=Gary F.|title=English Poetry of the Sixteenth Century|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0582090962|pages=263‚Äì70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L9gFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Waller,+Gary.+English+Poetry+of+the+Sixteenth+Century|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the central figures of the British renaissance canon remain, [[Edmund Spenser]], Sir [[Philip Sidney]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Ben Jonson]], and [[John Donne]].&lt;ref&gt;"English Poetry" James P. Bednarz. Oxford Bibliographies [http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0209.xml]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], [[John Donne|Donne]], and [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]] were major influences on 17th-century poetry. However, poet [[John Dryden]] condemned aspects of the metaphysical poets in his criticism. In the 18th century [[Metaphysical poetry]] fell into further disrepute,&lt;ref&gt;"Life of Cowley," in Samuel Johnson's ''Lives of the Poets''&lt;/ref&gt; while the interest in [[Elizabethan literature|Elizabethan poetry]] was rekindled through the scholarship of [[Thomas Warton]] and others. However, the canon of Renaissance poetry was formed in the Victorian period with anthologies like Palgrave's ''[[Golden Treasury]]''.&lt;ref&gt; Gary F. Waller, (2013). ''English Poetry of the Sixteenth Century''. London: Routledge. p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Yvor Winters]] were two literary critics who were especially concerned with revising the canon of renaissance English literature. Eliot, for example, championed poet [[Sir John Davies]] in an article in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' in 1926. During the course of the 1920s, Eliot did much to establish the importance of the metaphysical school, both through his critical writing and by applying their method in his own work. However, by 1961 [[A. Alvarez]] was commenting that "it may perhaps be a little late in the day to be writing about the Metaphysicals. The great vogue for Donne passed with the passing of the Anglo-American experimental movement in modern poetry."&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Two decades later, a hostile view was expressed that emphasis on their importance had been an attempt by Eliot and his followers to impose a 'high Anglican and royalist literary history' on 17th-century English poetry.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Brown &amp; Taylor (2004), ''ODNB''&lt;/ref&gt;

The American critic [[Yvor Winters]] suggested in 1939 an alternative canon of [[Elizabethan poetry]],&lt;ref&gt;''Poetry'', LII (1939, pp. 258-72, excerpted in Paul. J. Alpers (ed): ''Elizabethan Poetry. Modern Essays in Criticism''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; which would exclude the famous representatives of the [[Petrarchan|Petrarchan school]] of poetry, represented by Sir [[Philip Sidney]] and [[Edmund Spenser]]. Winters claimed that the Native or Plain Style ''anti-Petrarchan'' movement had been undervalued and argued that [[George Gascoigne]] (1525‚Äì1577) "deserves to be ranked [‚Ä¶] among the six or seven greatest lyric poets of the century, and perhaps higher".&lt;ref&gt;''Poetry'', LII (1939, pp. 258‚Äì72, excerpted in Paul. J. Alpers (ed): ''Elizabethan Poetry. Modern Essays in Criticism''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967: 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 20th century the established canon was increasingly under fire.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Expansion of the literary canon in the 20th century===
In the twentieth century there was a general reassessment of the [[literary canon]], including [[Women's writing in English|women's writing]], [[post-colonial literature]]s, [[LGBT literature|gay and lesbian literature]], writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of historically marginalized groups. This reassessment has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered "literature", and genres hitherto not regarded as "literary", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Claire |title=The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1992 |page=vix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Paul |chapter=Introduction |title=Early Modern Women's Writing |publisher=Oxford UP |year=2000 |pages=ix‚Äìx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western literary canon has also expanded to include the literature of Asia, Africa, the [[Middle East]], and South America. Writers from countries like Turkey, China, Egypt, Peru, and Colombia, Japan, etc., have received Nobel prizes since the late 1960s. Writers from Asia and Africa have also been nominated for, and also won, the [[List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize for Fiction|Booker prize]] in recent years. 

==== Feminism and the literary canon ====
{{See also|√âcriture f√©minine|List of American feminist literature|List of feminist literature|List of feminist poets}}
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] at [[Balzac]] Memorial ]]
The feminist movement produced both feminist fiction and non-fiction and created new interest in women's writing. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's [[Women's history|historical]] and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain&gt;{{cite book |author=Blain, Virginia |author2=Clements, Patricia |author3=Grundy, Isobel  |title=The feminist companion to literature in English: women writers from the Middle Ages to the present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-04854-8 |pages=vii‚Äìx}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, in Britain and America at least women achieved major literary success from the late eighteenth century, and many major nineteenth-century British novelists were women, including [[Jane Austen]], the [[Bront√´s|Bront√´ family]], [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], and [[Mary Ann Evans|George Eliot]]. There were also three major female poets, [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]],&lt;ref name="Leighton"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela Leighton|title=Elizabeth Barrett Browning|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wHp90dJD7fkC&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=22 October 2011|year=1986|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-25451-1|pages=8‚Äì18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christina Rossetti]] and [[Emily Dickinson]].&lt;ref name="Bloo9"&gt;Bloom (1999), 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford (1966), 122&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century there were also many major female writers, including [[Katherine Mansfield]], [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Eudora Welty]], and [[Marianne Moore]]. Notable female writers in France include [[Colette]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]; and in Russia, [[Anna Akhmatova]].

Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. [[Virago Press]] began to publish its large list of 19th and early 20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation.

====Black authors====
In the twentieth century, the Western literary canon started to include black writers not only from [[African-American literature|black American writers]], but also from the [[African diaspora|wider black diaspora]] of writers in Britain, France, Latin America, and Africa. This is largely due to the shift in social and political views during the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States.  The first global recognition came in 1950 when [[Gwendolyn Brooks]] was the first black American to win a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Literature. [[Chinua Achebe]]'s novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' helped draw attention to [[African literature]]. Nigerian [[Wole Soyinka]] was the first African to win the [[Nobel Prize]] in Literature in 1986, and American [[Toni Morrison]] was the first black woman to win in 1993.

Some early American [[Black writers]] were inspired to defy ubiquitous racial prejudice by proving themselves equal to white American authors. As Henry Louis Gates, Jr., has said, "it is fair to describe the subtext of the history of black letters as this urge to refute the claim that because blacks had no written traditions they were bearers of an inferior culture."&lt;ref name = "Stryz_p140"&gt;"The Other Ghost in Beloved: The Specter of the Scarlet Letter" by Jan Stryz from ''The New Romanticism: a collection of critical essays'' by Eberhard Alsen, p. 140, {{ISBN|0-8153-3547-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

African-American writers were also attempting to subvert the literary and power traditions of the United States. Some scholars assert that writing has traditionally been seen as "something defined by the dominant culture as a white male activity."&lt;ref name = "Stryz_p140"/&gt; This means that, in American society, literary acceptance has traditionally been intimately tied in with the very power dynamics which perpetrated such evils as racial discrimination. By borrowing from and incorporating the non-written oral traditions and folk life of the [[African diaspora]], African-American literature broke "the mystique of connection between literary authority and [[patriarchal]] power."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Marjorie Pryse in "The Other Ghost in Beloved: The Specter of the Scarlet Letter" by Jan Stryz, from ''The New Romanticism: a collection of critical essays'' by Eberhard Alsen, p. 140, {{ISBN|0-8153-3547-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In producing their own literature, African Americans were able to establish their own literary traditions devoid of the white intellectual filter. This view of African-American literature as a tool in the struggle for Black political and cultural liberation has been stated for decades, most famously by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].&lt;ref name = "jhu_theory"&gt;Mason, [http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/hopkins_guide_to_literary_theory/free/african-american_theory_and_criticism-_1.html "African-American Theory and Criticism"] (accessed July 6, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asia and Africa====
Since the 1960s the Western literary canon has been expanded to include writers from Asia, Africa, the Middle East. This is reflected in the Nobel prizes awarded in literature.

[[Yasunari Kawabata]] (1899 ‚Äì 1972)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yasunari Kawabata - Facts|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1968/kawabata-facts.html|accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[novelist]] and [[short story]] writer whose spare, lyrical, subtly-shaded prose works won him the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1968, the first Japanese author to receive the award. His works have enjoyed broad international appeal and are still widely read.

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  (1927 ‚Äì 2014) was a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter, and journalist. Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century and one of the best in the [[Spanish literature|Spanish language]], he was awarded the 1972 [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]] and the 1982 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1982/ | title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1982 | accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Garc√≠a M√°rquez started as a journalist, and wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best known for his novels, such as ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'' (1967), ''[[The Autumn of the Patriarch]]'' (1975), and ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]'' (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as [[magic realism]], which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called [[Macondo]] (the town mainly inspired by his birthplace [[Aracataca]]), and most of them explore the theme of [[solitude]]. On his death in April 2014, [[Juan Manuel Santos]], the President of Colombia, described him as "the greatest Colombian who ever lived."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/19/gabrielgarciamarquez-colombia|title=Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez: 'The greatest Colombian who ever lived'|first=Ed|last=Vulliamy|date=19 April 2014|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canon of Western philosophers==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}

{{see also|List of important publications in philosophy}} 

The discussion of the literary canon above, especially with regard to "Great Book" and the "debate" over the canon, is also relevant.

[[Ancient Greek philosophy]] has consistently held a prominent place in the canon. Only a relatively small number of works of Greek philosophy have survived, essentially those thought most worth copying in the Middle Ages. [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and, indirectly, [[Socrates]] are the primary figures. [[Roman philosophy]] is included, but regarded as less significant (as it tended to be even by the Romans themselves).  The [[ancient philosophy]] of other cultures now receives more attention than before the 20th century.  The vast body of [[Christian philosophy]] is typically represented on reading lists mainly by Saints [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the 12th-century Jewish scholar [[Maimonides]] is now usually represented, mostly by ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]''. The academic canon of [[early modern philosophy]] generally includes [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], though influential contributions to philosophy were made by many thinkers in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Aloysius Martinich, Fritz Allhoff, Anand Vaidya, ''Early modern philosophy: essential readings with commentary''. Oxford : Blackwell, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women in philosophy|Women have engaged in philosophy]] throughout the field's history. There were female [[philosopher]]s since ancient times, notably [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active c. 325 BC) and [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th‚Äì4th century BC), and some were accepted as philosophers during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]], [[Modern philosophy|modern]] and [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] eras, but almost no female philosophers have entered the philosophical Western canon.&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane.

While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|author=|date=15 August 2013|website=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greeks===
Many [[philosopher]]s today agree that Greek philosophy has influenced much of [[Western culture]] since its inception. [[Alfred North Whitehead]] once noted: "The safest general characterization of the [[Europe]]an philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to [[Plato]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead (1929), ''[[Process and Reality]]'', Part II, Chap. I, Sect. I.&lt;/ref&gt; Clear, unbroken lines of influence lead from [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophers]] to [[Early Islamic philosophy]], the European [[Renaissance]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141031222017/http://kevinscharp.com/Kevin%20Scharp%20-%20%20Diagrams.htm Kevin Scharp (Department of Philosophy, Ohio State University) ‚Äì Diagrams].&lt;/ref&gt; Greek philosophy was probably influenced by the philosophy and mythological cosmogonies of the [[ancient Near East]], as well as Indian Vedanta philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;J.

[[Plato]] was a [[philosopher]] in [[Classical Greece]] and the founder of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], the first institution of higher learning in the [[Western world]]. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the [[Western philosophy|Western tradition]], unlike nearly all of his [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophical contemporaries]].&lt;ref&gt;"...the subject of philosophy, as it is often conceived‚Äîa rigorous and systematic examination of ethical, political, metaphysical, and epistemological issues, armed with a distinctive method‚Äîcan be called his invention" ({{cite web |last=Kraut |first=Richard |title=Plato |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/ |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |publisher=Stanford University |date=11 September 2013 |accessdate=3 April 2014 |ref=harv}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John M.; Hutchinson, D. S., eds. (1997): "Introduction".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] and scientist. His writings cover many subjects ‚Äì&amp;nbsp;including [[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]], [[Aristotle's biology|biology]], [[zoology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], ethics, [[aesthetics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], theater, music, [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], politics and government‚Äîand constitute the first comprehensive system of [[Western philosophy]].&lt;ref name="philosophy1972"&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle's views on [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] had a profound influence on medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] into the [[Renaissance]], and his views were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]]. In metaphysics, [[Aristotelianism]] profoundly influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800‚Äì1400)|Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and continues to influence [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Neoplatonism]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as "The First Teacher" ({{lang-ar|{{big|ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπŸÑŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸàŸÑ}}}}). His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]]. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cicero |first=Marcus Tullius |publication-date=1874 |origyear=106‚Äì43 BC |chapter=Book II, chapter XXXVIII, ¬ß119 |title=The Academica of Cirero  |editor-first=James S. |editor-last=Reid  |location=London |publisher=Macmillian and company |ref=harv}} "''veniet flumen orationis aureum fundens Aristoteles''", (Google translation: "Aristotle will come pouring forth a golden stream of eloquence")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian philosophy===

Major Western writers and philosophers have been influenced by [[Eastern philosophy]]. 

Through his teacher [[Ammonius Saccas]] (died {{circa|AD 265}}, the Greek speaking philosopher [[Plotinus]] may have been influenced by Indian thought, because of the similarities between [[neoplatonism]] and the [[Vedanta]] philosophies of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Bussanich. The roots of Platonism and Vedanta. International Journal of Hindu Studies. January 2005, Volume 9, Issue 1, pp 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R.

===Renaissance philosophy===
Major philosophers of the [[Renaissance]] include [[Niccol√≤ Machiavelli]], [[Pico della Mirandola]], [[Nicholas of Cusa]], [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Galileo Galilei]].

===Seventeenth-century philosophers===
{{expand section|date=November 2018}}
The seventeenth century was important for philosophy, and the major figures were [[Francis Bacon]] (1561‚Äì1626), [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588‚Äì1679), [[Ren√© Descartes]] (1596‚Äì1650), [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632‚Äì1677), [[John Locke]] (1632‚Äì1704), [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646‚Äì1716),  and [[Isaac Newton]] (1642‚Äì c.1726).&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;"Western Philosophy", [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Western-philosophy/Modern-philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eighteenth-century philosophers===
Major philosophers of the eighteenth century include [[George Berkeley]] (1685‚Äì1753), [[David Hume]] (1711‚Äì1776), [[Adam Smith]] (1723‚Äì1790), [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724‚Äì1804), [[Jeremy Bentham]] (1748‚Äì1832), [[Voltaire]] (1694‚Äì1778), [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712‚Äì1778), and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729‚Äì1797).&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Nineteenth-century philosophers===
Important nineteenth century philosophers include [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770-1831), [[S√∏ren Kierkegaard]] (1813-1855), [[Karl Marx]] (1818‚Äì1883) and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844‚Äì1900).

===Twentieth-century philosophers===

Major twentieth century figures are [[Henri Bergson]] (1859‚Äì1941), [[Edmund Husserl]] (1859-1938), [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872-1970), [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889-1976) and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (1889‚Äì1951). A porous distinction between [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[Continental philosophy|continental]] approaches emerged during this period. The term "continental" is misleading, as many prominent British philosophers such as [[R. G. Collingwood]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]] were non-analytic, and many non-British European philosophers like [[Wittgenstein]] were analytic. Moreover, analytic approaches are dominant in the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Germany, and parts of east-central Europe today. Some argue in English-speaking countries, it is better to distinguish between the dominant approaches of university departments, where Modern Language departments tend to favor continental methods and philosophy department tends to favor analytic ones. However, the humanities/social sciences departments in general such as history, sociology, anthropology, and political science departments in English-speaking countries tend to favor continental methods such as those by [[Michel Foucault]] (1926-1984), [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1930-2002) and [[J√ºrgen Habermas]] (1929- ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most cited authors of books|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/most-cited-authors-of-books-in-the-humanities-2007/405956.article|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are the most-cited publications in the social sciences (according to Google Scholar)?|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/05/12/what-are-the-most-cited-publications-in-the-social-sciences-according-to-google-scholar/|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female philosophers have begun to gain prominence in the last hundred years. Notable female philosophers from the contemporary period include [[Susanne Langer]] (1895‚Äì1985), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908‚Äì1986), and [[Martha Nussbaum]] (1947‚Äì  ).

==Classical music==
[[File:Johann Sebastian Bach.jpg|left|thumb|[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] ]]
The term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] to [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] as a golden age. In addition to Bach and Beethoven, the other major figures from this period were [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rushton, Julian]], ''Classical Music'', (London, 1994), 10&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to "classical music" recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is from about 1836.&lt;ref name="Music 2007"&gt;"Classical", ''The Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music'', ed. Michael Kennedy, (Oxford, 2007), ''Oxford Reference Online''. Retrieved July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical music]], during the nineteenth century a "canon" developed which focused on what was felt to be the most important works written since 1600, with a great concentration on the later part of this period, termed the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], which is generally taken to begin around 1750. After Beethoven, the major nineteenth-century composers include [[Robert Schumann]], [[Fr√©d√©ric Chopin]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Giacomo Puccini]], and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ten Top Romantic Composers".''Gramapne'' [https://www.gramophone.co.uk/feature/top-10-romantic-composers].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, the standard concert repertoire of professional orchestras, chamber music groups, and choirs tends to focus on works by a relatively small number of mainly 18th- and 19th-century male composers. Many of the works deemed to be part of the musical canon are from genres regarded as the most ''serious'', such as the [[symphony]], [[concerto]], [[string quartet]], and [[opera]]. [[Folk music]] was already giving [[art music]] melodies, and from the late 19th century, in an atmosphere of increasing [[nationalism]], folk music began to influence composers in formal and other ways, before being admitted to some sort of status in the canon itself.

Since the early twentieth century [[non-Western music]] has begun to influence Western composers. In particular, direct homages to [[Java]]nese [[gamelan music]] are found in works for western instruments by [[Claude Debussy]], [[B√©la Bart√≥k]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[John Cage]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[Philip Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.coastonline.org/mml/topic/topicsSearch_detail.php?id=312 Western Artists and Gamelan]", ''CoastOnline.org''.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307082145/http://www.coastonline.org/mml/topic/topicsSearch_detail.php?id=312 |date=2014-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Debussy was immensely interested in non-Western music and its approaches to composition. Specifically, he was drawn to the Javanese [[Gamelan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rest Is Noise|last=Ross|first=Alex|publisher=Fourth Estate|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84115-475-6|location=London|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which he first heard at the 1889 Paris Exposition. He was not interested in directly quoting his non-Western influences, but instead allowed this non-Western aesthetic to generally influence his own musical work, for example, by frequently using quiet, unresolved dissonances, coupled with the damper pedal, to emulate the "shimmering" effect created by a [[gamelan]] ensemble. American composer Philip Glass was not only influenced by the eminent French composition teacher [[Nadia Boulanger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Richard|last=Kostelanetz|year=1989|editor-first=Richard|editor-last=Kostelanetz|title=Writings on Glass|chapter=Philip Glass|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles; London|page=109|isbn=0-520-21491-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also by the Indian musicians [[Ravi Shankar]] and [[Alla Rakha]], His distinctive style arose from his work with Shankar and Rakha and their perception of rhythm in Indian music as being entirely additive.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Joan|last=La Barbara|year=1989|editor-first=Richard|editor-last=Kostelanetz|title=Writings on Glass|chapter=Philip Glass and Steve Reich: Two from the Steady State School|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles; London|pages=40‚Äì41|isbn=0-520-21491-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the latter half of the 20th century the canon expanded to cover the so-called [[Early music]] of the pre-classical period, and [[Baroque music]] by composers other than Bach and [[George Frideric Handel]]. including [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Fran√ßois Couperin]], [[Heinrich Sch√ºtz]], and [[Dieterich Buxtehude]]. Earlier composers, such as [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Orlande de Lassus]] and [[William Byrd]], have also received more attention in the last hundred years.{{Citation needed|reason=List of names with no source|date=January 2017}}

The absence of female composers from the canon has been debated in the twentieth century, even though there have been [[women composers|female composers]] throughout the classical music period.  Marcia J Citron, for example, has examined "the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women [sic] composers from the received 'canon' of performed musical works."&lt;ref name=Citron&gt;Citron, Marcia J. "Gender and the Musical Canon." CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the music of [[Hildegard von Bingen]] (1098‚Äì1179), a German Benedictine abbess, has been rediscovered, and both the Russian [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] (born 1931) and Finnish [[Kaija Saariaho]] (born 1952) have achieved international reputations. Saariaho's opera ''[[L'amour de loin]]'' has been staged in some of the world's major opera houses, including The [[English National Opera]] (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Fiona Maddocks | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/12/rusalka-glyndebourne-opera-review-coliseum | title=Singin' through the pain | work=The Guardian | date=2009-07-11 | accessdate=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York.

{{main article|Art history}}
The backbone of traditional Western [[art history]] are [[artwork]]s commissioned by wealthy patrons for private or public enjoyment. Much of this was religious art, mostly [[Roman Catholic art]]. The [[classical art]] of Greece and Rome has, since the Renaissance, been the fount of the Western tradition.

[[Giorgio Vasari]] (1511‚Äì1574) is the originator of the artistic canon and the originator of many of the concepts it embodies.  His ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' covers only artists working in Italy,&lt;ref&gt;With nods in the text to [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Albrecht D√ºrer]], but not lives.&lt;/ref&gt; with a strong pro-Florentine prejudice, and has cast a long shadow over succeeding centuries.  Northern European art has arguably never quite caught up to Italy in terms of prestige, and Vasari's placing of [[Giotto]] as the founding father of "modern" painting has largely been retained.  In painting, the rather vague term of [[Old master]] covers painters up to about the time of [[Goya]].

This "canon" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection present in art history textbooks, as well as the prices obtained in the [[art trade]]. But there have been considerable swings in what is valued. In the 19th century the [[Baroque]] fell into great disfavour, but it was revived from around the 1920s, by which time the [[Academic art|art]] of the 18th and 19th century was largely disregarded. The [[High Renaissance]], which Vasari regarded as the greatest period, has always retained its prestige, including works by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Raphael]], but the succeeding period of [[Mannerism]] has fallen in and out of favour. 

In the 19th century the beginnings of academic art history, led by German universities, led to much better understanding and appreciation of [[medieval art]], and a more nuanced understanding of classical art, including the realization that many if not most treasured masterpieces of sculpture were late Roman copies rather than Greek originals. The European tradition of art was expanded to include [[Byzantine art]] and the new discoveries of [[archaeology]], notably [[Etruscan art]], [[Celtic art]] and [[Upper Paleolithic art]].

Since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of art made by women; vernacular creativity, especially in printed media; and an expansion to include works in the Western tradition produced outside Europe.  At the same time there has been a much greater appreciation of non-Western traditions, including their place with Western art in wider global or [[Eurasia]]n traditions. The [[decorative arts]] have traditionally had a much lower critical status than [[fine art]], although often highly valued by collectors, and still tend to be given little prominence in undergraduate studies or popular coverage on television and in print.

English artist and sculptor [[Barbara Hepworth]] [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] (1903&amp;nbsp;‚Äì 1975), whose work exemplifies [[Modernism]], and in particular modern sculpture, is one of the few female artists to achieve international prominence.&lt;ref name=gale&gt;Gale, Matthew [http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/dame-barbara-hepworth-1274 "Artist Biography: Barbara Hepworth 1903‚Äì75"] Retrieved 31 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the art of American [[modernist]] [[Georgia O'Keefe]] has been staged at the [[Tate Modern]], in London, and is then moving in December 2016 to [[Vienna]], Austria, before visiting the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], Canada in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ago.net/art-gallery-of-ontario-partners-with-tate-modern-to-present-georgia-okeeffe-retrospective-in-summer-2017|title=Art Gallery of Ontario partners with Tate Modern to present Georgia O'Keeffe retrospective in summer 2017 ‚Äì AGO Art Gallery of Ontario|author=|date=|website=www.ago.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical exclusion of Women====
Women were discriminated against in terms of obtaining the training necessary to be an artist in the mainstream Western traditions. In addition, since the Renaissance the [[Nude (art)|nude]], more often than not female,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} has had a special position as subject matter. In her 1971 essay, "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]", [[Linda Nochlin]] analyzes what she sees as the embedded privilege in the predominantly male Western art world and argues that women's outsider status allowed them a unique viewpoint to not only critique women's position in art, but to additionally examine the discipline's underlying assumptions about gender and ability.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nochlin|first=Linda|author-link=Linda Nochlin|chapter=[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]|title=Women, Art and Power and Other Essays|year=1971|publisher=Westview Press|url=&lt;!-- |accessdate = 2014-11-28 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nochlin's essay develops the argument that both formal and social education restricted artistic development to men, preventing women (with rare exception) from honing their talents and gaining entry into the art world.&lt;ref name="Nochlin women artists" /&gt;

In the 1970s, feminist art criticism continued this critique of the institutionalized sexism of art history, art museums, and galleries, and questioned which genres of art were deemed museum-worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Atkins |first1= Robert |author-link1= |year= 2013|title= Artspeak: A Guide to Contemporary Ideas, Movements, and Buzzwords, 1945 to the Present |edition= 3rd|location= New York|publisher= Abbeville Press |isbn= 9780789211507 |oclc=855858296}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is articulated by artist [[Judy Chicago]]:
"[I]t is crucial to understand that one of the ways in which the importance of male experience is conveyed is through the art objects that are exhibited and preserved in our museums. Whereas men experience presence in our art institutions, women experience primarily absence, except in images that do not necessarily reflect women's own sense of themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chicago|first1=Judy|author-link1=Judy Chicago|last2=Lucie-Smith|first2=Edward|author-link2=Edward Lucie-Smith|title=Women and Art: Contested Territory|year=1999|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|location=New York|isbn=0-8230-5852-2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary anthologies of renaissance literature====
The preface to the [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] anthology of ''Renaissance Literature'' from 2003 acknowledges the importance of online access to literary texts on the selection of what to include, meaning that the selection can be made on basis of functionality rather than representativity".&lt;ref&gt;''Michael Payne &amp; John Hunter (eds). Renaissance Literature: an anthology''. Oxford: Blackell, 2003, {{ISBN|0-631-19897-0}}, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; This anthology has made its selection based on three principles. One is "unabashedly ''canonical''", meaning that Sidney, Spenser, Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Jonson have been given the space prospective users would expect. A second principle is "non-canonical", giving female writers such as [[Anne Askew]], [[Elizabeth Cary, Lady Falkland|Elizabeth Cary]], [[Emilia Lanier]], [[Martha Moulsworth]], and [[Lady Mary Wroth]] a representative selection. It also includes texts that may not be representative of the qualitatively best efforts of Renaissance literature, but of the quantitatively most numerous texts, such as homilies and erotica. A third principle has been thematic, so that the anthology aims to include texts that shed light on issues of special interest to contemporary scholars.

The Blackwell anthology is still firmly organised around authors, however. A different strategy has been observed by ''The Penguin Book of Renaissance Verse'' from 1992.&lt;ref&gt;''David Norbrook &amp; H. R. Woudhuysen (eds.): ''The Penguin Book of Renaissance Verse''. London: Penguin Books, 1992, {{ISBN|0-14-042346-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the texts are organised according to topic, under the headings ''The Public World'', ''Images of Love'', ''Topographies'', ''Friends, Patrons and the Good Life'', ''Church, State and Belief'', ''Elegy and Epitaph'', ''Translation'', ''Writer, Language and Public''. It is arguable that such an approach is more suitable for the interested reader than for the student. While the two anthologies are not directly comparable, since the Blackwell anthology also includes prose and the Penguin anthology goes up to 1659, it is telling that while the larger Blackwell anthology contains work by 48 poets, seven of which are women, the Penguin anthology contains 374 poems by 109 poets, including 13 women and one poet each in Welsh, [[Si√¥n Phylip]], and Irish, [[Eochaidh √ì He√≥ghusa]].

'''''What Just Happened''''' is a 2008 American [[satire|satirical]] [[comedy-drama]] directed by [[Barry Levinson]] and starring [[Robert De Niro]]. The supporting cast includes [[Catherine Keener]], [[Robin Wright Penn]], [[Stanley Tucci]], and [[Sean Penn]].

''What Just Happened'' is an independent film, produced by [[2929 Productions]], [[Art Linson|Art Linson Productions]] and [[Tribeca Productions]], and was released on October 17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.yahoo.com/2008-cannes-film-festival-lineup-1463981.html 2008 Cannes Film Festival Lineup. voices.yahoo.com. December 10, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film is based on the book ''What Just Happened? Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line'' by [[Art Linson]], about his experiences as a producer in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;"What Just Happened?: Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line".Author Art Linson
{{ISBN|1-58234-240-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This film was shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on May 25, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.yahoo.com/2008-cannes-film-festival-lineup-1463981.html 2008 Cannes Film Festival Lineup. voices.yahoo.com. December 10, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Ben ([[Robert De Niro]]), a veteran [[Hollywood]] producer, is suffering a number of professional and personal problems. His latest film, ''Fiercely'', has a disastrous test screening, mostly because of its ending which features the murder of its main character (played by [[Sean Penn]], who plays himself elsewhere in the film) along with his pet dog.

Ben and his maverick [[United Kingdom|British]] director, Jeremy Brunell ([[Michael Wincott]]), plead their case to studio executive Lou Tarnow ([[Catherine Keener]]). She accuses Ben of filming the dog's killing only so he could use it as a "bargaining chip" - to make it easier to negotiate against cutting other problematic scenes. Lou threatens to pull Ben's movie from [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and take over editing unless at least the dog's death is removed. Jeremy adamantly refuses, throwing a tantrum.

Adding to Ben's problems, he is having trouble making a clean break from Kelly, his second wife. Ben later discovers his wife is having an affair with Scott Solomon, a married screenwriter who Ben has previously worked with. Scott has a screenplay that he's trying to get off the ground, to which [[Brad Pitt]] later becomes attached.  

Lastly the studio is threatening to cancel a planned [[Bruce Willis]] movie because of the star's unwillingness to shave the large, thick beard that he has grown. Ben's career hinges on the fate of the film, but any attempt to reason with Willis inevitably meets a violent, foul-mouthed response.

Ultimately Jeremy relents and re-edits the ending of ''Fiercely'' to have the dog survive. Ben tries to get Willis's agent, Dick Bell, to reason with him and get the beard removed, but his efforts only get Ben fired. Nonetheless, Willis does eventually shave his beard off, and the film goes ahead.

A week later, Ben, Lou and Jeremy attend Cannes, hopeful that they might take a [[Palme D'Or]] award. Unfortunately, and without telling Ben or Lou, Jeremy has re-edited ''Fiercely'' again, not only killing the dog, but adding nearly a full minute of bullets being shot into their bodies. While the new ending destroys the film's chances of a Palme d'Or and angers many in the audience, others eagerly applaud the final version of the film, including Sean Penn (playing himself). Lou is not impressed, and immediately flies out of Cannes on the studio's private jet, leaving Ben stranded in [[France]].

Ben eventually does make it back home, in time for a photo-shoot of Hollywood's top thirty producers with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', although after the magazine's publishers hear about the debacle in Cannes, Ben is relegated to the far edge of the photo, meaning he will be barely noticeable.

==Critical reception==
Based on 139 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has received an overall "Rotten" rating of 51%, with a [[weighted average]] score of 5.8/10.&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/what_just_happened/ |title=What Just Happened |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Flixster |accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sites consensus states: "''What Just Happened'' has some inspired comic moments, but this inside-baseball take on Hollywood lacks [[satire|satirical]] bite."
