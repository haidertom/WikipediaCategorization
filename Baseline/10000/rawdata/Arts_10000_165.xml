[[File:Hokusai au musée Guimet (8207452088).jpg|thumbnail|right|Kirifuri waterfall at Kurokami Mountain in Shimotsuke]]
'''''A Tour of the Waterfalls of the Provinces''''' (''Shokoku taki meguri'') is a series of landscape [[Woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] by the Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist [[Hokusai]].

Completed c.&amp;nbsp;1833–34 and containing eight prints, it was the first ukiyo-e series to approach the theme of falling water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forrer|first1=Matthi|last2=Hokusai|first2=Katshushika|title=Hokusai: prints and drawings|date=1991|publisher=Prestel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was acclaimed for its innovative and expressive depictions. The waterfalls take up most of each sheet, dwarfing the scenes' human inhabitants, and are rendered by Hokusai with a powerful sense of life, reflecting his [[animism|animistic]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hokusai|year=2003|first=Gian Carlo|last=Calza|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0714844578|page=489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In Japan's [[Shinto]]ist religion, gods and spirits inhibit the surrounding nature, such as trees, rocks or animals. In the Waterfall series, using newly imported blue [[Prussian]] pigment that was fashionable at that time, Hokusai paints each waterfall differently, in order to emphasize the unique beauty of each site and to outline his belief that water was sacred.

==Content==
The waterfalls Hokusai chose to illustrate are located in the central, western and eastern parts of Japan's main island ([[Honshu]]). The regions chosen were well known for pilgriming and by the travelers of his time, while three of the waterfalls, Kirifuri, Amida and [[Yōrō]], are among Japan's 100 most beautiful even today.{{who|date=November 2018}} All the prints are in vertical format and in their composition there is sometimes included human or animal forms which appear to be insignificant in front of the plummeting water. Unlike most of his other works, in the Waterfalls series Hokusai uses more color, in order to highlight the new and main theme: the falling water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nagata|first1=Seiji|last2=Hokusai|first2=Katsushika|title=Hokusai: genius of the Japanese ukiyo-e|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides using imported blue pigments either from [[Berlin]] or Prussia, the artist also adds contrasting yellows, browns and greens to paint the surrounding forested mountains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11145">{{short description|The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam universally accepts a process of divinely guided evolution}}
{{Original research|date=October 2018}}
{{Refimprove|date=January 2018}}
{{Primary sources|date=January 2018}}
{{creationism2}}

The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam universally accepts the process of evolution, albeit divinely guided, and actively promotes it. Over the course of several decades, the movement has issued various publications in support of the scientific concepts behind the process of evolution and frequently engages in promoting how religious scripture supports the concept.

==Views on creationism and intelligent design==

Ahmadi Muslims do not take all the [[Quranic]] and [[Biblical]] [[Creationism|creation]] narratives literally, but understand some of the passages metaphorically. [[Darwinian evolution]] as well as [[Intelligent design]] models are rejected as are certain aspects of [[Islamic creationism]] that some modernist religious bodies have postulated. Instead they propound the concept of "Guided Evolution" (analogous, or identical, to the doctrine of [[theistic evolution]] or [[evolutionary creationism]] held by almost all liberal Christians, and some others) which is demonstrated as being supported both by scriptural and scientific evidence. 

Ahmadis favor the perspective that the human race evolved out of the earth over a long period of time. The [[Qur'an]] teaches that man was created from the earth through a gradual evolutionary process in the following verses:

{{quote|And He [Allah/God] has created you in different stages and different forms ... And Allah has caused you to develop as a good growth from the earth.|Qur'an 71:14,17}}

These verses illustrate that the creation of the human race was the culmination of a gradual evolutionary process and that it would be incorrect to say (as [[Creationism]]/[[Intelligent design]] suggests) that God formed the human being in an instant.&lt;ref name="original_sin"&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/links/original_sin.html Quran, Adam and Original Sin], by Belal Khalid&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Ahmadis accept the concept of evolution in principle, but do not accept Darwinian evolution in all its details.

==Adam and Eve==

Ahmadi Muslims also reject the creationist doctrine that [[Adam]] was the first human being on Earth, and proclaim that he was appointed as the first Prophet of God. This is supported by the verse of the [[Qur'an]] which refers to the appointment of a Representative of God on earth, rather than the creation of a new species, viz: 

{{quote|[2:30] And when thy Lord said to the angels: ‘I am about to appoint a Vicegerent in the earth,’ they said: ‘Wilt Thou place therein such as will cause disorder in it, and shed blood? — and we glorify Thee with Thy praise and extol Thy holiness.’ He answered: ‘I know what you know not.’}}

Ahmadis reason logically that the angels could only have questioned the appointment of a human being as a Prophet  because they had already witnessed disorder and bloodshed amongst the already existing humans. 

The story of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] as given in the Bible is viewed by Ahmadis as being more of an account of religious history than a history of the entire human race. 

Belal Khalid, an Ahmadi scholar, clarified in his work, “Original Sin”:

{{quote|When the stage of the full development of the mental faculties of man was reached, God sent His revelation to the most perfect man of that generation, namely, Hadhrat Adam (as).

In short, the Quran teaches that man's physical creation and development are the result of a process of evolution and in the same way his intellectual development is also the result of a process of evolution. Hadhrat Adam (as) was not the first human being, but was the first human being whose intellect was capable of accepting and bearing the responsibility of revelation.”&lt;ref name="original_sin" /&gt;}}

==Guided evolution==
Rather than adopting the [[Darwinist]] theory of unguided natural selection, Ahmadi Muslims promote the supposition of “guided evolution” as being part of the progressive design of God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Guided_evolution_and_punctuated_equilibrium-20081104MN.pdf Guided evolution and punctuated equilibrium]&lt;/ref&gt;  As such they deny that [[natural selection]] occurred purely by chance,&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_5_section_5.html Part V, Section 5: Survival by Accident or Design?]&lt;/ref&gt; or merely by survival of the fittest&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_5_section_8.html Part V, Section 8: Natural Selection and Survival of the Fittest]&lt;/ref&gt; – and view each stage of the evolutionary process as being selectively and continually woven to an intricate level by one creator (Allah).&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_5_section_12.html Part V, Section 12: Organic Systems and Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Furthermore, illustrated with scientific theories and Quranic scripture, Ahmadis contend that the processes of life on Earth started from one single point of species (bacteria)&lt;ref&gt;Review of Religions eGazette November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; with a mixture of water and a viscous clay-like substance.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_5_section_4.html Part V, Section 4: The Essential Role of Clay and Photosynthesis in Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;  From the source of that one single organism, to the point of the first Prophet Adam (so the Ahmadiyya view) was a slow gradual evolutionary process that occurred over several stages (Lane). Each stage being of a variable timescale - perhaps over billions of years.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_5_section_1.html Part V, Section 1: Life in the Perspective of Quranic Revelations – A Brief Introductory Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of Ahmadiyya consider that the notion of unguided 'natural selection' does not adequately explain how various species that have progressed from the lowest forms to the highest forms have solely depended upon occurrence of random mutations within the gene pool, or purely by the demands of environmental factors. In his book ''Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge and Truth'' (published 1998), [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], the late leader of the Ahmadiyya movement, elaborated the complex mechanism of evolution as having been played more like strategic game of Chess than a game of Dice.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_5_section_10.html Part V, Section 10: A Game of Chess or a Game of Chance!]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently evolutionary processes could only have been guided by a vastly higher intelligence (God).

==Creation of the universe==
{{Ahmadiyya|Distinct views}}
Similar to [[Theistic realism]] and the stance of modernist Islamic scholars, Ahmadis adopt a scientific cosmological approach to explaining the formation of universe initiated from the [[Big Bang]]&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_4_section_5.html Part IV, Section 5: The Quran and Cosmology]&lt;/ref&gt; and highlight how these theories relate with Quranic scripture. 

Some of the following verses for example, illustrate how certain aspects of modern scientific theory correspond with religious scripture:

{{quote|Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together,&lt;br /&gt;
then We clove them asunder and We created every living thing out of the water. &lt;br /&gt;
Will they not then believe?|Qur'an 21:30 
('''[[Big Bang|Big Bang Theory]]''' and the origin of life from water)}}

{{quote|Then turned He to the heaven when it was smoke, &lt;br /&gt;
and said unto it and unto the earth: &lt;br /&gt;
Come both of you, willingly or loth. &lt;br /&gt;
They said: We come, obedient.|Qur'an 41:11 ('''The Earth from [[Nebulae]]. ''')}}

{{quote|On the day when We will roll up heaven like the &lt;br /&gt;
rolling up of the scroll for writings, &lt;br /&gt;
as We originated the first creation, (so) We &lt;br /&gt;
shall reproduce it; a promise (binding on Us); &lt;br /&gt;
surely We will bring it about.|Qur'an 21:104 ('''[[Big crunch]] Theory''')}}

Ahmadis also explain these verses were written over 1400 years ago – long before mankind had reached any level of scientific insight. Thus modern science has recently uncovered proofs about the universe which contend with these verses, so this is indication that the verses were revealed from the God that created the universe.

==Six individual phases of creation==
Furthermore, Ahmadis highlight several verses in the Quran where it mentions of "Six periods of creation" and use these verses to explain 
the theory that the universe began roughly 13 billion years ago. 
A single period, in the Ahmadi view, has no definitive timescale and could mean anywhere from one day to billions of years. 

{{quote|And, verily, We created the heavens &lt;br /&gt;
and the Earth and all that is between &lt;br /&gt;
them in six periods and no weariness &lt;br /&gt;
touched Us.|Qur'an 50:38}}

According to the Ahmadiyya view the universe passed from stage to stage till the Earth assumed a shape and developed properties which could sustain human life.

==Extraterrestrial evolution==
Generally, Ahmadis believe that life is almost certainly not limited to planet Earth. The possibility of life having evolved on other planets is clearly established in the first chapter of the Qur'an which speaks of the plurality of worlds:

{{quote|All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of '''All the Worlds'''.|Quran 1:2}}

{{quote|It is Allah who has created seven heavens and of the earth, '''the like of them'''. [His] command descends among them so you may know that Allah is over all things competent and that Allah has encompassed all things in knowledge.|Quran 65:12}}

The following verse corroborates this interpretation:

{{quote|And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and of whatever living creatures (da'bbah) He has spread forth in both. And He has the power to gather them together when He will so please".|42:29}}

Ahmadis believe that any planet that contains the key ingredient of life—water—may also harbour life, as God has created all living things from water: 

{{quote|We (God) created every living thing out of the water.|Qur'an 21:30}}

The '''Ancient Monuments Society''' (AMS) is a [[learned society]] and [[Charitable organization#Charity registration|registered charity]] in England and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|209605}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1924 "for the study and conservation of ancient monuments, historic buildings and fine old craftsmanship".

==National Amenity Societies==
The Ancient Monuments Society is recognised as one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], and as such is informed of any application for listed building consent in England and Wales involving any element of demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015 |publisher=www.gov.uk |date=24 March 2015 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such it plays an important part in shaping the historic environment in England and Wales.

==Partnership with Friends of Friendless Churches==
The Ancient Monuments Society works in partnership with the [[Friends of Friendless Churches]], sharing an office and staff and operating a joint membership scheme. The co-operation came about because Friends of Friendless Churches was set up by [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas]], who was also Secretary and later Chairman of the Ancient Monuments Society.

==Publications==
The AMS publishes three newsletters and a volume of ''Transactions'' (scholarly articles on a range of architectural historic topics) annually for its 2,100 members.

'''Architectural Engineering''', also known as '''Building Engineering''' or '''Architecture Engineering''', is the application of [[engineering]] principles and [[technology]] to [[building design]] and [[construction]]. Definitions of an '''architectural engineer''' may refer to:
* An engineer in the [[structural engineering|structural]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], construction or other engineering fields of building design and construction.
* A [[Professional engineer|licensed engineering professional]] in parts of the [[United States]].
*Architectural engineers are those who work with other engineers and architects for the designing and construction of buildings.

==Engineering for designer==

===Structural engineering===

{{Main|Structural engineering}}
Structural engineering involves the analysis and design of the built environment (buildings, bridges, equipment supports, towers and walls). Those concentrating on buildings are sometimes informally referred to as "building engineers". Structural engineers require expertise in [[strength of materials]], [[structural analysis]], and in predicting [[structural load]] such as from weight of the building, occupants and contents, and extreme events such as wind, rain, ice, and [[seismic design]] of structures which is referred to as [[earthquake engineering]]. Architectural Engineers sometimes incorporate structural as one aspect of their designs; the structural discipline when practiced as a specialty works closely with architects and other engineering specialists.

===Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP)===
{{Main|Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing}}
[[File:MEP Room Virginia Tech.JPG|thumb|right|200px|MEP room in a building]]

[[Mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]] engineers are specialists, commonly referred to as ([[Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing]]) when engaged in the building design fields. Also known as "[[building services engineering]]" in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.cibse.org/Building-Services/What-s-so-special-about-Building-Services-Engineer/Building-Services-Engineers-Bring-Buildings-to-Lif|website =  Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers|title = Building Services Engineers Bring Buildings to Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical engineers often design and oversee the [[heating, ventilation and air conditioning]] (HVAC), [[plumbing]] and [[rain gutter]] systems. Plumbing designers often include design specifications for simple [[active fire protection]] systems, but for more complicated projects, [[fire protection engineering|fire protection engineers]] are often separately retained. Electrical engineers are responsible for the building's [[power distribution]], [[telecommunication]], [[fire alarm]], signalization, [[lightning protection]] and [[control systems]], as well as [[Architectural lighting design|lighting systems]].

==The architectural engineer (PE) in the United States==
{{Main|Architectural engineer (PE)}}
In many jurisdictions of the United States, the architectural engineer is a [[Professional engineer|licensed]] engineering professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncees.org/Licensure.php |title=Licensure |publisher=NCEES |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101230715/https://ncees.org/Licensure.php |archivedate=2012-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually a graduate of an architectural engineering university program preparing students to perform whole-building design in competition with architect-engineer teams; or for practice in one of structural, mechanical or electrical fields of building design, but with an appreciation of integrated architectural requirements. 

Formal architectural engineering education, following the engineering model of earlier disciplines, developed in the late 19th century, and became widespread in the United States by the mid-20th century.  With the establishment of a specific "architectural engineering" [[NCEES]] [[Professional Engineer]]ing registration examination in the 1990s, and first offering in April 2003, architectural engineering became recognized as a distinct engineering discipline in the United States. 

In most license-regulated jurisdictions, architectural engineers are not entitled to practice architecture unless they are also licensed as architects, and may be restricted from the practice of structural engineering on specific types of higher importance buildings such as hospitals.  Regulations and customary practice vary widely by region or city.

==The architect as architectural engineer{{anchor|Architect}}==
{{See also|Architect#Professional requirements}}
In some countries, the practice of architecture includes planning, designing and overseeing the building's construction, and architecture, as a [[profession]] providing [[architect#Architects in practice|architectural services]], is referred to as "architectural engineering". In Japan, a "first-class architect" plays the dual role of architect and building engineer, although the services of a licensed "structural design first-class architect" are required for buildings over a certain scale.&lt;ref name=JapanInfoCenter&gt;{{cite web|title=Architects / Building Engineers in Japan|url=http://www.jaeic.or.jp/k-pamphlet_e20130507.pdf|publisher=The Japan Architectural Education and Information Center|accessdate=2014-08-16|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some languages, such as [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], "architect" is literally translated as "architectural engineer". In some countries, an "architectural engineer" (such as the ''ingegnere edile'' in Italy) is entitled to practice [[architecture]] and is often referred to as an architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://architectplan.download/ Architecture Plan (in English)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2018}} These individuals are often also structural engineers. In other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Iran, and most of the Arab countries, architecture graduates receive an engineering degree (''Dipl.-Ing. – Diplom-Ingenieur'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bak.de/site/498/default.aspx German Chamber of Architects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427191023/http://www.bak.de/site/498/default.aspx |date=April 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, an "architect" has a technical university education and legal powers to carry out building structure and facility projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1999-21567 "Ley de Ordenación de la Edificación" (Building Management Act)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, architects and engineers used to share the same accreditation process (Conselho Federal de Engenheiros, Arquitetos e Agrônomos (CONFEA) – Federal Council of Engineering, Architecture and Agronomy). Now the Brazilian architects and urbanists have their own accreditation process (CAU – Architecture and Urbanism Council). Besides traditional architecture design training, Brazilian architecture courses also offer complementary training in engineering disciplines such as structural, electrical, hydraulic and mechanical engineering. After graduation, architects focus in architectural planning, yet they can be responsible to the whole building, when it concerns to small buildings (except in electric wiring, where the architect autonomy is limited to systems up to 30kVA, and it has to be done by an Electrical Engineer), applied to buildings, urban environment, built cultural heritage, landscape planning, interiorscape planning and regional planning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.confea.org.br/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?sid=1196 Resolução 1010/05 – Conselho Federal de Engenharia, Arquitetura e Urbanismo – CONFEA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515160635/http://www.confea.org.br/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?sid=1196 |date=May 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2007-2010/2010/Lei/L12378.htm LEI nº 12.378, de 2010 – Presidência da República]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece licensed architectural engineers are graduates from architecture faculties that belong to the Polytechnic University,&lt;ref&gt;[[Polytechnic (Greece)]]&lt;/ref&gt; obtaining an "Engineering Diploma". They graduate after 5 years of studies and are fully entitled architects once they become members of the Technical Chamber of Greece (TEE – Τεχνικό Επιμελητήριο Ελλάδος).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.tee.gr/ Technical Chamber of Greece (Τεχνικό Επιμελητήριο Ελλάδος)&lt;!-- Bot generated title (+ human editing) --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.tee.gr/portal/page/portal/INTER_RELATIONS/english/role |title=Role &amp; Objectives |publisher=Technical Chamber of Greece |archivedate=2011-08-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814025131/http://portal.tee.gr/portal/page/portal/INTER_RELATIONS/english/role }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Technical Chamber of Greece has more than 100,000 members encompassing all the engineering disciplines as well as architecture.
A prerequisite for being a member is to be licensed as a qualified engineer or architect and to be a graduate of an engineering and architecture schools of a Greek university, or of an equivalent school from abroad.
The Technical Chamber of Greece is the authorized body to provide work licenses to engineers of all disciplines as well as architects, graduated in Greece or abroad. The license is awarded after examinations. The examinations take place three to four times a year. The Engineering Diploma equals a master's degree in ECTS units (300) according to the Bologna Accords.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bologna Process#Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Further|Engineer's degree}}
The architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical engineering branches each have well established educational requirements that are usually fulfilled by completion of a university program.
[[File:Air handling unit.JPG|thumb|225px|An [[air handling unit]] is used for the heating and cooling of air in a central location (click on image for legend). Bringing together knowledge of [[acoustic engineering]] and [[HVAC]] is one example of the multi-disciplined nature of architectural engineering]]

===Architectural engineering as a single integrated field of study===
{{Main|Building engineering education}}

What differentiates architectural engineering from architecture (architect) as a separate and single, integrated field of study, compared to other engineering disciplines, is its multi-disciplinary engineering approach. Through training in and appreciation of architecture, the field seeks integration of building systems within its overall building design. Architectural engineering includes the design of building systems including [[HVAC|heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)]], plumbing, [[fire protection]], [[electrical]], [[lighting]], [[architectural acoustics]], and structural systems. In some university programs, students are required to concentrate on one of the systems; in others, they can receive a generalist architectural or building engineering degree.

An '''arts district''' is a demarcated urban area, usually on the periphery of a [[city centre]], intended to create a 'critical mass' of places of cultural consumption - such as [[Art gallery|art galleries]], [[Nightclub|dance club]]s, [[Theater (structure)|theatre]]s, [[art cinema]]s, music venues, and public squares for performances. Such an area is usually encouraged by public policy-making and planning, but sometimes occurs spontaneously. It is associated with allied service-industry jobs like cafes, printers, fashion outlets, restaurants, and a variety of 'discreet services' (see the back-page small-ads of almost any cultural events-listings magazine).

There may also be some artists' studios located in nearby back-streets. But, as [[Richard Florida]] has found from his research, cultural production facilities are often better sited some miles away from cultural consumption facilities - except in some very tolerant cities and in countries where a boisterous alcohol-based nightlife scene does not lead to aggressive and anti-social behaviour.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the term sometimes used is "Cultural quarter" or "Arts quarter".

== Types of Arts Districts ==
Steiner and Butler outline five types of arts districts commonly found in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiner|first=Frederick|title=Planning and Urban Design Standards|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-76090-0|page=242|author2=Kent Butler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Cultural compounds - tend to be the oldest art districts often established in cities before the 1930s.  These tend to be well-known art districts engrained into the mentality and culture of a community or nation.
# Major Cultural Institutions - large institutions that serve as anchors for an arts district such as large concert halls, playhouses, libraries, or museums.
# Arts and entertainment centers - focus primarily on smaller, popular attractions such as small theaters, private galleries, restaurants, and other entertainment that often has a more bohemian feel than larger more established districts.
# Downtown Arts Districts - occasionally art districts encompass an entire downtown and especially when tourism and walk-ability is the focus of downtown.
# Cultural Production Districts - cultural production districts are characterized by production spaces such as specialized studios, arts centers, and media facilities.  These areas are often tied to affordable studio housing for artists and prioritize the cultural life of the neighborhood.

[[File:Ashanti English Medieval Ewer.jpg|thumb|Asante Ewer, British Museum, 62.3 cm high (including lid)]]

The '''Asante Ewer''' or '''Asante Jug''' is a leaded [[bronze]] lidded jug dated to the 1390s.  It is a rare surviving example of an English bronze jug from the 14th century, with great significance for the study of bronze working in medieval England.  It was taken from [[Kumasi]] in [[Ashanti Empire|Asante]] (now [[Ghana]]) during the [[Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War]] in 1895, and since 1896 has been held by the [[British Museum]] in London.

The front of the Asante Jug is decorated with the [[Royal Arms of England]] from the late 14th century, surmounted by a crown, with two lion [[supporters]].  Above three lines of lettering in a [[Lombardic capitals|Lombardic script]], within a moulded band, read from the bottom: 
: "+ HE THAT WYL NOT SPARE WHEN HE MAY HE SHALL NOT / SPEND WHEN HE WOULD DEME THE BEST IN EVERY / DOWT TIL THE TROWTHE BE TRYID OWTE"
The inscription appears to be two English sentences, run together:
: "He that will not spare when he may he shall not spend when he would" and "Deem the best in every doubt until the truth be tried out".

The neck of the Asante Jug bears six [[roundel]]s, three on either side, each with a falcon spreading its wings, with one to each side of the spout and two either side of the handle.  On the lip are three lions facing left, and a stag in a circle facing right.  The seven-sided lid of the jug is original, decorated with a lion above a stag [[couchant]] in each segment.  The handle ends with a scrolled [[quatrefoil]].

Without the lid, the jug is {{convert|43.3|cm}} high, and the lid (including the overlapping underlip) is {{convert|19.6|cm}}.  When assembled with its lid, the jug is {{convert|62.3|cm}} high.  It weighs {{convert|18.6|kg}}, and has a capacity of {{convert|15.8|l}}.  When filled, it would be inconveniently heavy to use.

Only two similar jugs are known in the UK.  All have similar shapes, bear inscriptions in English with similar lettering, and were made from leaded bronze, an alloy of copper, tin and lead, cast in a two-part mould in a similar manner using bronze spacers to separate the inner and outer moulds, with similar heraldic decorative motifs.  The Asante jug is the largest, and the only one to retain its lid.  

Of the other two jugs, the smallest is [[Wenlok jug]] in Luton: it was sold by [[Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh]] in 2005.  The third is the [[Robinson jug]], which was found in a farmhouse in Norfolk in the 1879 and is now in the collection of the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]].  The other two have fittings for a hinged lid but the lid has not survived.  

All three jugs were made in England.  The heraldic emblems on this jug link it to either [[Edward III]] or [[Richard II]].  The stag badges on the lid suggest Richard II, who used the white stag in the 1390s.  The jug was found in [[Manhyia Palace]] in Kumasi in 1895, but when and how it arrived in West Africa is not known.  It is speculated that it was carried from Europe to Africa in the Early Modern period as an impressive gift to present to an African ruler, having been bought cheaply there. There is a photograph taken in 1887 which shows the jug under a sacred tree at the royal palace.  

The jug was bought by the British Museum in 1896 from Major General [[Charles St Leger Barter]], who served in the [[Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War]] in December 1895 to February 1896 (also known as the Second Ashanti Expedition) which reached [[Kumasi]] and depose the [[Asantehene]] [[Prempeh I]].

Another plainer 14th century English lidded jug is in [[Leeds City Museum]].

'''Bernard Natan''' (born '''Natan Tannenzaft'''; July 14, 1886&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; – October&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; 1942) was a [[France|Franco]]-Romanian film entrepreneur, director and actor of the 1920s and 1930s. He was once said by historians to be one of the earliest (if not the earliest) [[pornographic film]] directors and porn stars,&lt;ref name="Waugh"&gt;Waugh, Thomas. ''Hard To Imagine.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-231-09998-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slade"&gt;Slade, Joseph. "Bernard Natan: France's Legendary Pornographer." ''Journal of Film and Video.'' 45:2–3 (Summer-Fall 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; although there is now considerable doubt about this.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt; Natan certainly worked in  mainstream cinema from his youngest days, working his way up from projectionist and chemist to cinematographer and producer.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt; He eventually acquired the giant French motion picture studio [[Pathé]] in 1929. Pathé collapsed in 1935, and Natan was convicted of fraud. However, he laid the foundation for the modern film industry in France and helped revolutionize film technology around the world.&lt;ref name="Slade" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Natan was born Natan Tannenzaft (possibly Tanenzapf) to [[Jew]]ish parents in [[Iaşi]],&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; [[Romania]] in 1886. He moved to France in the early 1900s and, despite being a Romanian, volunteered to fight for France in [[World War I]]. In 1909 he married and subsequently had 2 children.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane"&gt;Cairns, David &amp; Duane, Paul. ''Natan.'' Screenworks, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 he became a [[French nationality law|French citizen]], and at some point changed his name to "Bernard Natan."&lt;ref name="Waugh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slade" /&gt; His younger brother [[Emile Natan]] also moved to France and became a film producer.{&lt;ref&gt;Rossel-Kirschen and Willems&lt;/ref&gt;}

==Mainstream film career==
Natan worked as a projectionist, film lab chemist, titles designer, cinematographer and producer during his early years in Paris. He was as a publicity [[stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for [[Paramount Pictures]] during the early 1920s. But by 1929, Natan's Rapid Film had become a major film producer and distributor. His reputation was such that in 1924 Natan became a member of the executive committee of the Cinematographic Employers' Federation. By 1926, his film laboratory was highly regarded, he had established a marketing firm, and he built two [[sound stage]]s. Natan was also a film producer, helping finance and produce motion pictures at other studios.&lt;ref name="Rapid-Film"&gt;Willems, Gilles. "Rapid-Film et ses Branches Production." ''Pathé, Premier Empire du Cinéma.'' Jacques Kermabon, ed. Paris: Centre Georges Pompidou, 1994.  {{ISBN|2-85850-793-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;Willems, Gilles. "Les Origines du Groupe Pathé-Natan et le Modele Americain." ''Vingtième Siècle.'' 46 (April–June 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Takeover of Pathé===
In late February 1929, Bernard Natan acquired the production and exhibition businesses of Pathé, then the largest French motion picture company. He agreed to merge his own studio, Rapid Film (then worth 25 million [[French franc|francs]]), with Pathé in exchange for 50 million francs in shares. The remaining shares were purchased with funding from a consortium of banks, bonds (to be paid with income from Pathé), and a 10 percent ownership in Pathé by the banks. After the merger, Natan renamed the company Pathé-Natan (sometimes also credited as Pathé-Cinéma).&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster"&gt;Abel, Richard.

Pathé was already in substantial financial trouble when Natan took control. Studio founder [[Charles Pathé]] had been selling assets for several years to boost investor value and keep the studio's cash flow healthy. The company's founder had even sold Pathé's name and "rooster" trademark to other companies in return for a mere 2 percent of revenues generated by them. Natan had the bad luck to take charge of the studio just as the [[Great Depression]] convulsed the French economy.&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;Willems, Gilles. "Les origines de Pathé-Natan." In ''Une Histoire Économique du Cinéma Français (1895–1995), Regards Croisés Franco-Américains.'' Pierre-Jean Benghozi and Christian Delage, eds. Paris: Harmattan, Collection Champs Visuels, 1997. English translation available at [http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/classics/rr1199/gwrr8b.htm http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/classics/rr1199/gwrr8b.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109223643/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/classics/rr1199/gwrr8b.htm |date=January 9, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natan attempted to steady Pathé's finances and implement modern film industry practices at the studio. Natan acquired another film studio, [[Société des Cinéromans]], from [[Arthur Bernède]] and [[Gaston Leroux]], which enabled Pathé to expand into projector and electronics manufacturing. He also bought the Fornier chain of motion picture theaters and rapidly expanded the chain's nationwide presence.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The French press, however, attacked Natan mercilessly for his stewardship of Pathé. Many of these attacks were [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] and contained veiled [[homophobia|homophobic]] allusions to Natan's supposed sexuality.&lt;ref name="Slade" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Pathé-Natan did well under Natan's guidance. Between 1930 and 1935, despite the world economic crisis, the company made 100 million [[French franc|francs]] in profits, and produced and released more than 60 feature films (just as many films as major American studios produced at the time). He resumed production of the newsreel [[Pathé News]], which had not been produced since 1927.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Natan also invested heavily into research and development to expand Pathe's film business. In 1929, he pushed Pathé into [[sound film]]. In September, the studio produced its first sound feature film, and its first sound newsreel a month later. Natan also launched two new cinema-related magazines, ''Pathé-Revue'' and ''Actualités Féminines'', to help market Pathé's films and build consumer demand for cinema. Under Natan, Pathé also funded the research of [[Henri Chrétien]], who developed the [[anamorphic format|anamorphic lens]] (a technology which later led to the creation of [[CinemaScope]] and other [[widescreen]] film formats common today).&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Natan expanded Pathé's business interests into communications industries other than film. In November 1929, Natan established France's first television company, Télévision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. A year later, he purchased a radio station in Paris and formed a holding company (Radio-Natan-Vitus) to run what would become a burgeoning radio empire.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

===Collapse of Pathé and imprisonment===
In 1935, Pathé went bankrupt. In order to finance the company's continued expansion, Pathé's board of directors (which still included Charles Pathé) voted in 1930 to issue shares worth 105 million francs. But with the depression deepening, only 50 percent of the shares were purchased. One of the investor banks collapsed due to financial difficulties unrelated to Pathé's problems, and Pathé was forced to follow through with the purchase of several movie theater chains it no longer could afford to buy. Although the company continued to make a profit (as noted above) for a time, it soon began to lose more money than it could bring in.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

The collapse of Pathé led French authorities to indict Bernard Natan on charges of fraud. Natan was accused of financing the purchase of the company without any collateral, of bilking investors by establishing fictitious [[shell corporation]]s, and negligent financial mismanagement. Natan was even accused of hiding his Romanian and Jewish heritage by changing his name. Natan was indicted and imprisoned in 1939. This meant he was in prison when France fell to the Nazis, while most other major Jewish filmmakers were able to flee the country or go into hiding. A second indictment was brought in 1941, and he was convicted shortly thereafter. His French citizenship was taken away, which required special legal manovres by the state, since he had been naturalized as a result of his WWI military servie and there was no existing legal means to render him stateless. He was transferred from prison in September 1942 to the [[Drancy internment camp|camp at Drancy]], and shortly afterwards deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

==Adult film controversy==
In 1911, Natan and colleagues were convicted of making erotic films, he was jailed for a short time and fined 1,000 francs but due to his exceptional record fighting in World War I this was later removed from his record.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossel-Kirschen and Willems, p. 168-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources have claimed that Natan's career in pornography did not end there. Joseph Slade suggests that Natan may have directed at least one [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] pornographic film in Romania&lt;ref name="Waugh" /&gt; and produced and acted in at least 20 hardcore [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and [[bisexual]] films between 1920 and 1927.&lt;ref name="Trumpbour"&gt;Trumpbour, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Slade wrote that nearly all French pornographic films from this period which include bisexual and homosexual content were produced by Natan. The same source states that Natan himself was bisexual,&lt;ref name="Waugh"/&gt; and engaged in intercourse in ''[[Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly]]'' (1920) and ''La Maîtresse du Capitaine de Meydeux'' (1924). Furthermore, Slade claimed that he introduced [[Sadomasochism|masochism]] into French pornographic film.&lt;ref name="Slade"/&gt;

Slade's claims are disputed by the historians of the French organization "Les Indépendants du Premier Siècle", who argue that the various actors in question are not Natan and that accusations at Natan's trial and in [[Paris-Match]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hutchinson |first=Pamela |date=14 December 2015 |title=In need of rehabilitation: Bernard Natan, the Holocaust victim who saved France's film industry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/dec/14/bernard-natan-pathe-cinema-holocaust-victim-france-film-industry |location=The Guardian |access-date=24 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting him to the adult film industry were false.&lt;ref&gt;Rossel-Kirschen, André and Willems, Gilles. "Bernard Natan à la direction de Pathé-Cinéma." ''1895''. 21 (December 1996). Paris: AFRHC (association française pour l'Histoire du cinéma).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lips.org/bio_natan.%20reponse_%C3%A0_Slade.asp Droit de réponse Mise au point Sur le grand producteur Bernard Natan], LIPS.org,&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natan'', a 2013 documentary film, compares stills from the adult films attributed to Natan with official headshots and shows that several pornographic actors have been mistaken for Natan but are not him.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt; Joseph Slade now admits there is room for doubt over whether Natan worked in pornography at any time after 1910.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt;

==Death==
[[World War II]] broke out while Natan was in prison awaiting trial, and [[Nazi Germany]] conquered France. After Natan's release from prison, the French government handed him over to the [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|occupying German authorities]]. Natan was sent to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] on September 25, 1942,&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; where it is believed he died in 1943.&lt;ref name="CairnsDuane" /&gt;

==Importance to the film industry==
Bernard Natan's importance to the French film industry should not be underestimated. He pioneered the [[vertical integration]] of the French film industry, and adopted the "American model" of film-making and distribution. This model provides the underpinning of the French film industry even in the 21st century. Indeed, Pathé survived into the 1980s almost solely on revenues generated by the companies purchased and integration instituted by Bernard Natan.&lt;ref name="Rapid-Film" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;

Natan also brought television to France, and established the first French radio holding and television companies.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rooster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstWave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Under Natan's leadership, the anamorphic film camera lens was developed. The anamorphic lens was not only a major advance in film technology, but helped [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] survive during the early years of television.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David and Thompson, Kristin. ''Film Art.'' 4th ed. New York:  McGraw-Hill, 1993. {{ISBN|0-07-006446-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monaco, James. ''How to Read a Film: The Art, Technology, Language, History and Theory of Film and Media.'' Rev. ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 1981. {{ISBN|0-19-502806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently there was no public acknowledgement of Natan at La Fémis, the French national film school, which is housed in one of his former studios. A plaque commemorating his work, and his death in Auschwitz in 1942, was unveiled in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hutchinson |first=Pamela |date=14 December 2015 |title=In need of rehabilitation: Bernard Natan, the Holocaust victim who saved France's film industry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/dec/14/bernard-natan-pathe-cinema-holocaust-victim-france-film-industry |location=The Guardian |access-date=24 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wola Gułowska-trumna.jpg|thumb|350px|A crypt in [[Wola Gułowska]], [[Lublin Province]], [[Poland]]]]

A '''crypt''' (from [[Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:crypta#Latin|crypta]]'' "vault") is a stone chamber beneath the floor of a church or other building. It typically contains [[coffin]]s, [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], or [[Relic|religious relics]].

Originally, crypts were typically found below the main [[apse]] of a church, such as at the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain en Auxerre]], but were later located beneath [[chancel]], [[nave]]s and [[transept]]s as well. Occasionally churches were raised high to accommodate a crypt at the ground level, such as [[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim|St Michael's Church]] in [[Hildesheim]], [[Germany]].

==Etymology==
"Crypt" developed as an alternative form of the [[Latin]] "vault" as it was carried over into [[Late Latin]], and came to refer to the ritual rooms found underneath church buildings. It also served as a [[Bank vault|vault]] for storing important and/or sacred items. 

"Crypta", however, is also the female form of ''crypto'' "hidden". The earliest known origin of both is in the [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[wiktionary:κρύπτω#Ancient_Greek|κρύπτω]]'' (krupto/krypto), the first person singular indicative of the verb "to conceal, to hide".

==Development==
First known in the early Christian period, in particular North Africa at [[Chlef]] and [[Djemila]] in [[Algeria]], and [[Byzantium]] at [[Monastery of Stoudios|Saint John Studio]] in [[Constantinople]]. Where Christian churches have been built over [[Mithraeum|mithraea]], the mithraeum has often been adapted to serve as a crypt.

The famous crypt at [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]], Rome, developed about the year 600, as a means of affording [[pilgrim]]s a view of [[Saint Peter]]'s tomb, which lay, according to the Roman fashion, directly below the [[high altar]]. The tomb was made accessible through an underground passageway beneath the [[sanctuary]], where pilgrims could enter at one stair, pass by the tomb and exit, without interrupting the clerical community's service at the altar directly above.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonj Ghetti, ''et al.'' eds. ''Esplorazioni sotto la confessione di San Pietro. Eseguite negli anni 1940-1949'' (Città del Vaticano, 1951) 1:173-93, noted in Werner Jacobsen, "Saints' Tombs in Frankish Church Architecture" ''Speculum'' '''72'''.4 (October 1997:1107-1143) p. 1134 note 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crypts were introduced into [[Franks|Frankish]] church building in the mid-8th century, as a feature of its Romanization. Their popularity then spread more widely in western Europe under [[Charlemagne]]. Examples from this period are most common in the early medieval West, for example in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] at [[Dijon]] and [[Tournus]].

After the 10th century the early medieval requirements of a crypt faded, as church officials permitted relics to be held in the main level of the church. By the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period crypts were rarely built, however [[Burial vault (tomb)|burial vaults]] continued to be constructed beneath churches and referred to as crypts.

==Burial vaults==
{{main|Burial vault (tomb)}}
In more modern terms, a crypt is most often a stone chambered [[burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]] used to store the deceased. Crypts are usually found in [[cemetery|cemeteries]] and under public religious buildings, such as [[Church (building)|churches]] or [[cathedral]]s, but are also occasionally found beneath [[mausoleum|mausolea]] or [[chapel]]s on personal estates. Wealthy or prestigious families will often have a 'family crypt' or 'vault' in which all members of the family are interred. Many [[royal family|royal families]], for example, have vast crypts containing the bodies of dozens of former royalty. In some localities an above ground crypt is more commonly called a [[mausoleum]], which also refers to any elaborate building intended as a burial place, for one or any number of [[people]].

There was a trend in the 19th century of building crypts on medium to large size family estates, usually subtly placed on the edge of the grounds or more commonly incorporated into the cellar. After a change of owner these are often blocked up and the house deeds will not allow this area to be re-developed.

'''David Hume''' ({{IPAc-en|h|juː|m}}; born '''David Home'''; 7 May 1711 [[New Style|NS]] &lt;small&gt;(26 April 1711 [[Old Style|OS]])&lt;/small&gt; – 25 August 1776) was a [[Scottish Enlightenment]] [[philosopher]], [[historian]], [[economist]], and [[essayist]], who is best known today for his highly influential system of philosophical [[empiricism]], [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], and [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]].&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; Hume's empiricist approach to philosophy places him with [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] as a [[British Empiricism|British Empiricist]].{{sfn|Atherton|1999|p= ?}} Beginning with his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739), Hume strove to create a total naturalistic [[science of man]] that examined the psychological basis of human nature. Against philosophical [[rationalism|rationalists]], Hume held that passion rather than reason governs human behaviour. Hume argued against the existence of [[innatism|innate ideas]], positing that all human knowledge is founded solely in [[experience]]; Hume thus held that genuine knowledge must either be directly traceable to objects perceived in experience, or result from abstract reasoning about [[Relation of Ideas|relations between ideas]] which are derived from experience, calling the rest "nothing but sophistry and illusion",{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=166}} a [[dichotomy]] later given the name ''[[Hume's fork]]''.

In what is sometimes referred to as [[Hume's problem of induction]], he argued that [[inductive reasoning]] and belief in [[causality]] cannot be justified rationally; instead, our trust in causality and induction result from custom and mental habit, and are attributable only to the experience of "[[constant conjunction]]" of events.  This is because we can never actually perceive that one event causes another, but only that the two are always conjoined.  Accordingly, to draw any causal inferences from past experience it is necessary to presuppose that the future will resemble the past, a presupposition which cannot itself be grounded in prior experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9980.html|title=Berlin, I.; Hardy, H.,: The Roots of Romanticism (Second edition) (eBook and Paperback).|work=princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's opposition to the [[teleological argument]] for God's existence, the argument from design, is generally regarded as the most intellectually significant attempt to rebut the argument prior to [[Darwinism]].

Hume was also a [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalist]] who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment rather than abstract moral principle, famously proclaiming that [[Fact–value distinction|"Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions"]]. Hume's moral theory has been seen as a unique attempt to synthesise the modern sentimentalist moral tradition to which Hume belonged, with the [[virtue ethics]] tradition of [[ancient philosophy]], with which Hume concurred in regarding traits of character, rather than [[deontological ethics|acts]] or their [[consequentialism|consequences]], as ultimately the proper objects of moral evaluation.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Hume.html?id=2_FiLAAACAAJ|title=Hume|work=google.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume maintained an early commitment to naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena, and is usually taken to have first clearly expounded the [[is–ought problem]], or the idea that a statement of fact alone can never give rise to a [[norm (philosophy)|normative]] conclusion of what ''ought'' to be done.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"/&gt; Hume also denied that humans have an actual conception of the self, positing that we experience only  a [[bundle theory|bundle of sensations]], and that the self is nothing more than this bundle of causally-connected perceptions. Hume's [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] theory of [[free will]] takes [[determinism|causal determinism]] as fully compatible with human freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-freewill/|title=Hume on Free Will|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume influenced [[utilitarianism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Immanuel Kant]], the [[philosophy of science]], early [[analytic philosophy]], [[cognitive science]], [[theology]], and other movements and thinkers. Kant himself credited Hume as the spur to his philosophical thought who had awakened him from his "dogmatic slumbers".

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Hume was the second of two sons born to Joseph Home of [[Chirnside#Ninewells House|Ninewells]], an advocate, and his wife The Hon. Katherine (''née'' Falconer), daughter of Sir David Falconer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/humelife.html|title=David Hume, "My Own Life"|author=|date=|website=andromeda.rutgers.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born on 26 April 1711 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]) in a tenement on the north side of the [[Lawnmarket]] in [[Edinburgh]].  Hume's father died when Hume was a child, just after his second birthday, and he was raised by his mother, who never remarried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humesociety.org/about/HumeBiography.asp|title=David Hume Biography|work=humesociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He changed the spelling of his name in 1734, because of the fact that his surname ''Home,'' pronounced ''Hume,'' was not known in England. Throughout his life Hume, who never married, spent time occasionally at his family home at Ninewells in [[Berwickshire]], which had belonged to his family since the sixteenth century. His finances as a young man were very "slender". His family was not rich, and, as a younger son, he had little [[wikt:patrimony|patrimony]] to live on. He was therefore forced to make a living somehow.{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=3}}

Hume attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] at the unusually early age of 12 (possibly as young as 10) at a time when 14 was normal. At first, because of his family, he considered a career in [[Scots law|law]], but came to have, in his words, "an insurmountable aversion to everything but the pursuits of Philosophy and general Learning; and while [my family] fanceyed I was poring over [[Johannes Voet|Voet]] and [[Arnold Vinnius|Vinnius]], [[Cicero]] and [[Virgil]] were the Authors which I was secretly devouring".{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=3}} He had little respect for the professors of his time, telling a friend in 1735 that "there is nothing to be learnt from a Professor, which is not to be met with in Books".{{sfn|Mossner|1958|pp=30–33|ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Wright|2009|p=10}}}} Hume did not graduate.{{sfn|Harris|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=K2ygCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Hume+did+not+graduate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sc4E8eb4Ij&amp;sig=4SSQXHoO4QmiGKJuz-dyzgGSxxU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxp769u4vKAhUIhhoKHSs9BqcQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hume%20did%20not%20graduate&amp;f=false p. 35]}}

Aged around 18, he made a philosophical discovery that opened up to him "a new Scene of Thought", which inspired him "to throw up every other Pleasure or Business to apply entirely to it".{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=346}} He did not recount what this scene was, and commentators have offered a variety of speculations.{{Sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=8–9}} One popular interpretation, prominent in contemporary Hume scholarship, is that the new "scene of thought" was Hume's realization that [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson's]] "moral sense" theory of morality could be applied to the understanding as well. Due to this inspiration, Hume set out to spend a minimum of 10 years reading and writing. He soon came to the verge of a [[mental breakdown]], suffering from what a doctor diagnosed as the "Disease of the Learned". Hume wrote that it started with a coldness, which he attributed to a "Laziness of Temper", that lasted about nine months. Later, some [[scurvy]] spots broke out on his fingers. This was what persuaded Hume's physician to make his diagnosis. Hume wrote that he "went under a Course of Bitters and Anti-Hysteric Pills", taken along with a pint of claret every day. Hume also decided to have a more active life to better continue his learning.{{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=193}} His health improved somewhat, but, in 1731, he was afflicted with a ravenous appetite and palpitations of the heart. After eating well for a time, he went from being "tall, lean and raw-bon'd" to being "sturdy, robust [and] healthful-like".{{sfn|Hume|2011|pp=13–15}} Indeed, Hume would become well known in his time for his "corpulence", and his fondness for good port and cheese.

===Career===
At 25 years of age, Hume, although of noble ancestry, had no source of income and no learned profession. As was common at his time, he became a merchant's assistant, but he had to leave his native Scotland. He travelled via [[Bristol]] to [[La Flèche]] in Anjou, France. There he had frequent discourse with the [[Jesuits]] of the [[College of La Flèche]].{{sfn|Huxley|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eH67vOxyjEYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=hume+travelling+tutorship&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eBOIVMH_K4nvUvflg-gG&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20travelling%20tutorship&amp;f=false pp. 7–8]}}

While Hume was derailed in his attempts to start a university career by protests over his "[[atheism]]" and bemoaned that his literary debut, ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', 'fell dead-born from the press',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidhume.org/texts/mol.html|title=Texts - My Own Life (1777)|work=davidhume.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; he found literary success in his lifetime as an essayist, and a career as a librarian at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. His tenure there, and the access to research materials it provided, ultimately resulted in Hume's writing the massive six-volume ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]'', which became a bestseller and the standard history of England in its day. Hume described his "love for literary fame" as his "ruling passion"&lt;ref name="davidhume.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidhume.org/texts/mol.html|title=Texts - My Own Life (1777)|work=davidhume.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and judged his two late works, the so-called "first" and "second" enquiries, ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'', respectively, as his greatest literary and philosophical achievements,&lt;ref name="davidhume.org" /&gt; asking his contemporaries to judge him on the merits of the later texts alone, rather than the more radical formulations of his early, youthful work, dismissing his philosophical debut as [[juvenilia]]: "A work which the Author had projected before he left College."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidhume.org/texts/etv2.html|title=Texts - Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects, vol. 2 (1777)|work=davidhume.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Hume's protestations, a general consensus exists today that Hume's most important arguments and philosophically distinctive doctrines are found in the original form they take in the ''Treatise''. Hume was just 23 years old when he started this work and it is now regarded as one of the most important in the history of [[Western philosophy]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au" /&gt;

He worked for four years on his first major work, ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', subtitled "Being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects", completing it in 1738 at the age of 28. Although many scholars today consider the ''Treatise'' to be Hume's most important work and one of the most important books in Western philosophy, the critics in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the time did not agree, describing it as "abstract and unintelligible".{{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=195}} As Hume had spent most of his savings during those four years,{{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=193}} he resolved "to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvements of my talents in literature".{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=352}} Despite the disappointment, Hume later wrote, "Being naturally of a cheerful and [[Humorism|sanguine]] temper, I soon recovered from the blow and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country."{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=352}} There, in an attempt to make his larger work better known and more intelligible, he published the ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature (Abstract)|An Abstract of a Book lately Published]]'' as a summary of the main doctrines of the ''Treatise'', without revealing its authorship.{{sfn|Hume|1740}} Although there has been some academic speculation as to who actually wrote this pamphlet{{sfn|Norton|1993|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vv5ERpFQBCoC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=hume+abstract+author&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=70ODVLXoM4r_UIDpgNgP&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20abstract%20author&amp;f=false p. 31]}} it is generally regarded as Hume's creation.{{sfn|Redman|1997|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=1faeMedY8k8C&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=An+Abstract+of+a+Book+lately+Published;+Entitled&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XRryVP6yCYX6ygPViYDABg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=An%20Abstract%20of%20a%20Book%20lately%20Published%3B%20Entitled&amp;f=false p. 175, footnote 19]}}

After the publication of ''Essays Moral and Political'' in 1741, which was included in the later edition called ''[[Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary]]'', Hume applied for the Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. However, the position was given to [[William Cleghorn]]{{sfn|Nobbs|1965|p=575}} after Edinburgh ministers petitioned the town council not to appoint Hume because he was seen as an [[atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-rel/ |title=Hume, David: Religion &amp;#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:David Hume 1754.jpeg|thumb|left|An engraving of Hume from the first volume of his ''The History of England'', 1754]]
During the 1745 [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite rising]], Hume tutored the [[George Vanden-Bempde, 3rd Marquess of Annandale|Marquess of Annandale]] (1720–92), who was "judged to be a lunatic".{{sfn|Mossner|1950|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7HXJAqqNl4QC&amp;pg=PA378&amp;dq=annandale+lunatic+hume&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bxWIVPykIYHtUtevgvAI&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=annandale%20lunatic%20hume&amp;f=false p. 172]}} This engagement ended in disarray after about a year. However, it was then that Hume started his great historical work ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]''. This took him fifteen years and ran to over a million words. During this time he was also involved with the Canongate Theatre through his friend [[John Home]], a preacher.{{sfn|Fieser|2005|loc=[https://www.google.co.uk/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=canongate+theatre&amp;gws_rd=ssl#hl=en&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=canongate+theatre+hume+fieser p. xxii]}}

In this context, he associated with [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo|Lord Monboddo]] and other [[Scottish Enlightenment]] luminaries in Edinburgh. From 1746, Hume served for three years as secretary to General [[James St Clair]], who was envoy to the courts of [[Turin]] and [[Vienna]]. At that time Hume also wrote ''Philosophical Essays Concerning Human Understanding'', later published as ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''. Often called the ''First Enquiry'', it proved little more successful than the ''Treatise'', perhaps because of the publishing of his short autobiography, ''My Own Life'', which "made friends difficult for the first Enquiry".{{sfn|Buckle|1999|p= ?}}
In 1749 he went to live with his brother in the countryside.

Hume's religious views were often suspect. It was necessary in the 1750s for his friends to avert a trial against him on the charge of [[heresy in Christianity|heresy]]. However, he "would not have come and could not be forced to attend if he said he was not a member of the Established Church".{{sfn|Emerson|2009|p=244}} Hume failed to gain the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy (Glasgow)|chair of philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] for his religious views, too. He had published the ''[[Philosophical Essays]]'' by this time which were decidedly anti-religious. Even [[Adam Smith]], his personal friend who had vacated the Glasgow philosophy chair, was against his appointment out of concern public opinion would be against it.{{sfn|Rivers|2000|p=255}}

Hume returned to Edinburgh in 1751. In the following year "the Faculty of Advocates chose me their Librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large library".{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=11}} This resource enabled him to continue historical research for ''The History of England''. Hume's volume of ''Political Discourses'', written in 1749 and published by Kincaid &amp; [[Alexander Donaldson (bookseller)|Donaldson]] in 1752,{{sfn|Sher|2008|p=312}} was the only work he considered successful on first publication.{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=10}}

Eventually, with the publication of his six-volume ''The History of England'' between 1754 and 1762, Hume achieved the fame that he coveted.{{sfn|Emerson|2009|p=98}} The volumes traced events from the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Invasion of Julius Caesar]] to the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], and was a bestseller in its day.

Hume was also a longtime friend of bookseller [[Andrew Millar]], who sold Hume's ''History'' (after acquiring the rights from Scottish bookseller Gavin Hamilton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/2.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from David Hume to Andrew Millar, 12 April, 1755.|website=www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;), although the relationship was sometimes complicated. Letters between them illuminate both men's interest in the success of the ''History''.

===Later years===
[[File:Old Calton David Hume.jpg|thumb|David Hume's mausoleum by [[Robert Adam]]]]
From 1763 to 1765, Hume was invited to attend [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford|Lord Hertford]] in [[Paris]], where he became secretary to the British embassy.&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky, Raymond and Mossner, Ernest C. (eds.) (1954). ''New Letters of David Hume''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.77-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume was well received in Paris, and while there he met with [[Isaac de Pinto]]&lt;ref&gt;POPKIN, R. H. (1970). Hume and Isaac de Pinto. Texas Studies in Literature and Language, 12(3), 417–430. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/40754109&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766, Hume left Paris to accompany [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] to England.  Once in England, Hume and Rousseau fell out.&lt;ref name=wsj11042017&gt;"An Enlightened Friendship", Ruth Scurr, Wall Street Journal, November 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Hume was sufficiently worried about the damage to his reputation from the quarrel with Rousseau (who is generally believed to have suffered from [[paranoia]]) to have authored an account of the dispute, which he titled, appropriately enough ''"A concise and genuine account of the dispute between Mr. Hume and Mr. Rousseau."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/concisegenuineac00hume|title=A concise and genuine account of the dispute between Mr. Hume and Mr. Rousseau : with the letters that passed between them during their controversy. As also, the letters of the Hon. Mr. Walpole, and Mr. D'Alembert, relative to this extraordinary affair|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1765, he served as British [[Chargé d'affaires]], writing "despatches to the British Secretary of State".{{sfn|Fieser|2003|p=59}} He wrote of his Paris life, "I really wish often for the plain roughness of [[The Poker Club]] of Edinburgh&amp;nbsp;... to correct and qualify so much lusciousness".{{sfn|Mossner|1980|p=285}} In 1766, upon returning to Britain, Hume encouraged [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford|Lord Hertford]] to invest in a number of slave plantations, acquired by [[George Colebrooke]] and others in the [[Windward Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldmann, Felix (ed.) (2014). ''Further Letters of David Hume''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh Bibliographical Society, 2014, p.65-69; http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/all-his-remedies/ (paywall)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1767, Hume was appointed Under Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Here he wrote that he was given "all the secrets of the Kingdom". In 1769 he returned to James' Court in Edinburgh, and then lived, from 1771 until his death in 1776, at the southwest corner of St. Andrew's Square in Edinburgh's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]], at what is now 21 Saint David Street.{{sfn|Burton|1846|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CDYfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA384&amp;dq=hume+1767&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gUSIVLzvGIbmUsephJgK&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%201767&amp;f=false p. 384–385]}} A popular story, consistent with some historical evidence, suggests the street may have been named after Hume.{{sfn|Burton|1846|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=CDYfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA384&amp;dq=hume+1767&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gUSIVLzvGIbmUsephJgK&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=%22david%20street%22&amp;f=false p. 436, footnote 1]}}

In the last year of his life, Hume wrote an extremely brief autobiographical essay titled "My Own Life"&lt;ref name="andromeda.rutgers.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/humelife.html|title=David Hume, "My Own Life"|work=rutgers.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which summed up his entire life in "fewer than 5 pages",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oliveschreinerletters.ed.ac.uk/StanleyHumePersona.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and notably contains many interesting judgments that have been of enduring interest to subsequent readers of Hume.&lt;ref name="scholarcommons.sc.edu"&gt;http://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1130&amp;context=ssl&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048409912348781?journalCode=rajp20#.VcvMJHjeJBU|title= Hume's biography and Hume's philosophy| doi=10.1080/00048409912348781 | volume=77|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy|pages=1–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar of 18th-century literature Donald Seibert judged it a "remarkable autobiography, even though it may lack the usual attractions of that genre. Anyone hankering for startling revelations or amusing anecdotes had better look elsewhere."&lt;ref name="scholarcommons.sc.edu"/&gt;  Hume here confesses his belief that the "love of literary fame" had served as his "ruling passion" in life, and claims that this desire "never soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments." One such disappointment Hume discusses in the mini-autobiography was his disappointment that  with the initial literary reception of the ''Treatise'', which he claims to have overcome by means of the success of the ''Essays'': "the work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment". Hume, in his own retrospective judgment, suggested that his philosophical debut's apparent failure "had proceeded more from the manner than the matter." Hume thus suggests that  "I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to the press too early." Hume provides an unambiguous self-assessment of the relative value of his works: "my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject) is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best."  Hume also makes a number of self-assessments in the essay, writing of his social relations that "My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary", noting of his complex relation to religion, as well as the state, that "though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury", and professing of his character that "My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct." Hume concludes the essay with the frank admission: " I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained."&lt;ref name="andromeda.rutgers.edu"/&gt;

Diarist and biographer [[James Boswell]] saw Hume a few weeks before his death, which was from some form of abdominal cancer. Hume told him he sincerely believed it a "most unreasonable fancy" that there might be life after death.{{sfn|Boswell|1970|p= ?}} This meeting was dramatised in semi-fictional form for the [[BBC]] by [[Michael Ignatieff]] as ''Dialogue in the Dark''.{{sfn|Bassett|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MkTSD5UHu8AC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=dark+hume+Michael+Ignatieff&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YEuIVIzbEseqUbzng_gP&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=dark%20hume%20Michael%20Ignatieff&amp;f=false p. 272]}} Hume asked that his body be interred in a "simple Roman tomb". In his will he requests that it be inscribed only with his name and the year of his birth and death, "leaving it to Posterity to add the Rest".{{sfn|Mossner|1980|p=591}} It stands, as he wished it, on the southwestern slope of [[Calton Hill]], in the [[Old Calton Cemetery]]. Adam Smith later recounted Hume's amusing speculation that he might ask [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] to allow him a few more years of life in order to see "the downfall of some of the prevailing systems of superstition." The ferryman replied, "You loitering rogue, that will not happen these many hundred years&amp;nbsp;... Get into the boat this instant".{{sfn|Hume|1789|p=xxi}}

==Writings==
In the introduction to ''A Treatise of Human Nature'', Hume wrote, "'Tis evident, that all the sciences have a relation, more or less, to human nature&amp;nbsp;... Even Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some measure dependent on the science of Man." He also wrote that the [[science of man]] is the "only solid foundation for the other sciences" and that the method for this science requires both experience and observation as the foundations of a logical argument.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=7}} On this aspect of Hume's thought, philosophical historian [[Frederick Copleston]] wrote that it was Hume's aim to apply to the science of man the method of experimental philosophy (the term that was current at the time to imply [[Natural philosophy]]), and that "Hume's plan is to extend to philosophy in general the methodological limitations of [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]".{{sfn|Copleston|1999|pp=405–406}}

Until recently, Hume was seen as a forerunner of [[logical positivism]]; a form of anti-[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] empiricism. According to the logical positivists, unless a statement could be verified by experience, or else was true or false by definition (i.e. either [[tautology (logic)|tautological]] or [[contradiction|contradictory]]), then it was meaningless (this is a summary statement of their [[verificationism|verification principle]]). Hume, on this view, was a proto-positivist, who, in his philosophical writings, attempted to demonstrate how ordinary propositions about objects, causal relations, the self, and so on, are [[logical equivalence|semantically equivalent]] to propositions about one's experiences.{{sfn|Ayer|1946|p=40}}{{failed verification|date=March 2015}}

Many commentators have since rejected this understanding of Humean empiricism, stressing an [[epistemology|epistemological]] (rather than a [[semantics|semantic]]) reading of his project.&lt;ref name=CSW&gt;See e.g. {{harvtxt|Craig|1987|loc=Ch. 2}}, {{harvtxt|Strawson|2014|p= ?}}, and {{harvtxt|Wright|1983|p= ?}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this opposing view, Hume's empiricism consisted in the idea that it is our knowledge, and not our ability to conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims to knowledge on this basis.

===Impressions and ideas===

One of the most central doctrines of Hume's philosophy, stated in the very first lines of the ''Treatise'', is his notion that the mind consists of its mental perceptions, or the mental objects which are present to it, and which divide into two categories: ''impressions'' and ''ideas''. Hume's Treatise thus opens with the words: 'All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two distinct kinds, which I shall call IMPRESSIONS and IDEAS."  Hume states that "I believe it will not be very necessary to employ many words in explaining this distinction" and commentators have generally taken Hume to mean the distinction between [[feeling]] and [[thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cognition-and-commitment-in-humes-philosophy-9780195159592?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Cognition and Commitment in Hume's Philosophy|work=oup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially, Hume may regard the difference as in some sense a matter of degree, as he takes "impressions" to be distinguished from ideas, on the basis of their force, liveliness, and vivacity, or what Henry Allison calls the "FLV criterion" in his book on Hume.&lt;ref name="global.oup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/custom-and-reason-in-hume-9780199532889?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Custom and Reason in Hume|work=oup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas are therefore "faint" impressions. For example, experiencing the painful sensation of touching the handle of a hot pan is more forceful than simply thinking about touching a hot pan.  According to Hume, impressions are meant to be the original form of all our ideas, and Don Garret has thus coined the term "the copy principle" to refer to Hume's doctrine that all ideas are ultimately all copied from some original impression, whether it be a passion or sensation, from which they derive.&lt;ref name="global.oup.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/products/9780415283342|title=Hume|date=30 October 2014|work=routledge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After establishing the forcefulness of impressions and ideas, these two categories are further broken down into simple and complex: simple impressions and ideas, and complex impressions and ideas. Hume states that “simple perceptions or impressions and ideas are such as admit of no distinction nor separation,” while “the complex are the contrary to these, and may be distinguished into parts.”&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1896). A Treatise of Human Nature (L. A. Selby-Bigge, Ed.). Wotton-under-Edge: Oxford: Clarendon Press. Retrieved May 4, 2017, from Center for Security Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at an apple, a person experiences a variety of color-sensations, which Hume sees as a complex impression. Similarly, a person experiences a variety of taste-sensations, tactile-sensations, and smell-sensations when biting into an apple, with the overall sensation again being a complex impression. Thinking about an apple allows a person to form complex ideas, which are made of similar parts as the complex impressions they were developed from, but which are also less forceful. Hume believes that complex perceptions can be broken down into smaller and smaller parts until perceptions are reached that have no parts of their own, and these perceptions are thereby referred to as being simple.
                 
A person's imagination, regardless of how boundless it may seem, is confined to the mind's ability to recombine the information it has already acquired from the body's sensory experience (the ideas that have been derived from impressions). In addition, “as our imagination takes our most basic ideas and leads us to form new ones, it is directed by three principles of association, namely, resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect."&lt;ref&gt;Fieser, J. (2011, July 1). David Hume (1711-1776). In Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Retrieved March 8, 2017, from http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume/&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of resemblance refers to the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent resemble one another. For example, a person looking at an illustration of a flower can conceive of an idea of the physical flower because the idea of the illustrated object is associated with the idea of the physical object. The principle of contiguity describes the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent are near to each other in time or space, such as when the thought of one crayon in a box leads a person to think of the crayon contiguous to it. Finally, the principle of cause and effect refers to the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent are causally related, which explains how remembering a broken window can make someone think of the baseball that caused the window to shatter.
  
Hume elaborates more on this last principle of cause and effect. When a person observes that one object or event consistently produces the same object or event, it results in “an expectation that a particular event (a 'cause') will be followed by another event (an 'effect') previously and constantly associated with it."&lt;ref&gt;Norton, D. F. (1999). Hume, David. In R. Audi (Ed.), Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy (2nd ed., pp. 398-403). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.

(1990). An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. New York, NY: Anchor/Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though custom can serve as a guide in life, it still only represents an expectation. In other words, “experience cannot establish a necessary connection between cause and effect, because we can imagine without contradiction a case where the cause does not produce its usual effect…the reason why we mistakenly infer that there is something in the cause that necessarily produces its effect is because our past experiences have habituated us to think in this way."&lt;ref&gt;Drefcinski, S. (n.d.). [http://people.uwplatt.edu/~drefcins/humeencyclopediaentry.html A Very Brief Summary of David Hume]. Retrieved March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing this idea, Hume argues that "only in the pure realm of ideas, logic, and mathematics, not contingent on the direct sense awareness of reality, [can] causation safely…be applied – all other sciences are reduced to probability."&lt;ref&gt;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. (2010). Masterplots, Fourth Edition, 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses this skepticism to reject metaphysics and many theological views on the basis that they are not grounded in fact and observations, and are therefore beyond the reach of human understanding.

===Induction and causation&lt;!--linked from 'Problem of induction'--&gt;===
The cornerstone of Hume's epistemology is the [[problem of induction]]. This may be the area of Hume's thought where his scepticism about human powers of reason is most pronounced.{{sfn| Kenyon|Craig|1985|p= ?}} The problem revolves around the plausibility of [[inductive reasoning]], that is, reasoning from the observed behaviour of objects to their behaviour when unobserved. As Hume wrote, induction concerns how things behave when they go "beyond the present testimony of the senses, or the records of our memory".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 26}} Hume argues that we tend to believe that things behave in a regular manner, meaning that patterns in the behaviour of objects seem to persist into the future, and throughout the unobserved present.{{sfn|Atherton|1999|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=9u56iKhWQu4C&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=hume+Uniformity+of+Nature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DVOIVKTQAon4UojxgJgL&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20Uniformity%20of%20Nature&amp;f=false pp. 202–203]}} Hume's argument is that we cannot rationally justify the claim that nature will continue to be uniform, as justification comes in only two varieties—demonstrative reasoning and probable reasoning{{refn|These are Hume's terms. In modern parlance, ''demonstration'' may be termed ''[[deductive reasoning]]'', while ''probability'' may be termed ''[[inductive reasoning]]''.{{sfn|Millican|1996|p= ?}}|group=note}}—and both of these are inadequate. With regard to demonstrative reasoning, Hume argues that the uniformity principle cannot be demonstrated, as it is "consistent and conceivable" that nature might stop being regular.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 111}} Turning to probable reasoning, Hume argues that we cannot hold that nature will continue to be uniform because it has been in the past. As this is using the very sort of reasoning (induction) that is under question, it would be [[circular reasoning]].{{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 115}} Thus, no form of justification will rationally warrant our inductive inferences.

Hume's solution to this problem is to argue that, rather than reason, natural instinct explains the human practice of making inductive inferences. He asserts that "Nature, by an absolute and uncontroulable necessity has determin'd us to judge as well as to breathe and feel." Agreeing, philosopher [[John D. Kenyon]] writes: "Reason might manage to raise a doubt about the truth of a conclusion of natural inductive inference just for a moment&amp;nbsp;... but the sheer agreeableness of animal faith will protect us from excessive caution and sterile suspension of belief."{{sfn|Kenyon|Craig|1985|p= 254}} Commentators such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] have demurred from Hume's solution,{{sfn|Harris|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=uBbfizzKTDoC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;pg=PA42&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 42]}} while, some, such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Karl Popper]], saw that Hume's analysis "had posed a most fundamental challenge to all human knowledge claims."{{sfn|Popkin|2014}}

The notion of [[Causality|causation]] is closely linked to the problem of induction. According to Hume, we reason inductively by associating constantly conjoined events. It is the mental act of association that is the basis of our concept of causation. There are at least three interpretations of Hume's theory of causation represented in the literature: (1) the logical positivist; (2) the sceptical realist; and (3) the quasi-realist.{{sfn|Read|Richman|2002|pp=13–14 and 69}}

Hume acknowledged that there are events constantly unfolding, humanity cannot guarantee that these events are caused by events prior or if they are independent instances. Hume opposed the widely accepted theory of Causation that 'all events have a specific course or reason.' Therefore, Hume crafted his own theory of causation, which he formed through his empiricist and skeptic beliefs. He split Causation, into two realms “All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact”.&lt;ref&gt;. "Davidhume.org." Texts - An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748, 1777). Web. 19 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Relations of Ideas are a priori, and represent universal bonds between ideas that mark the cornerstones of human thought. Matters of Fact are dependent on the observer and experience. They are often not universally held to be true among multiple persons. Hume was an Empiricist, meaning he believed “causes and effects are discoverable not by reason, but by experience”.&lt;ref&gt;."Davidhume.org." Texts - An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748, 1777). Web. 19 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume later goes on to say that even with the perspective of the past, humanity cannot dictate future events because thoughts of the past are limited, compared to the possibilities for the future. Hume's separation between Matters of Fact and Relations of Ideas is often referred to as "[[Hume's fork]]".&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;William Edward Morris, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "David Hume"], [[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (May 21, 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume explains his theory of Causation and causal inference by division into three different parts. In these three branches he explains his ideas, in addition to comparing and contrasting his views to his predecessors. These branches are the Critical Phase, the Constructive Phase, and Belief.&lt;ref name="Davidhume 1748"&gt;"Davidhume.org." Texts - An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748, 1777). Web. 19 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Critical Phase, Hume denies his predecessors' theories of causation. Next, Hume uses the Constructive Phase to resolve any doubts the reader may have while observing the Critical Phase. “Habit or Custom” mends the gaps in reasoning that occur without the human mind even realizing it. Associating ideas has become second nature to the human mind. It “makes us expect for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past” &lt;ref name="Davidhume 1748"/&gt; However, Hume says that this association cannot be trusted because the span of the human mind to comprehend the past is not necessarily applicable to the wide and distant future. This leads Hume to the third branch of causal inference, Belief. Belief is what drives the human mind to hold that expectancy of the future based on past experience. Throughout his explanation of causal inference, Hume is arguing that the future is not certain to be repetition of the past and the only way to justify induction is through uniformity.

The [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] interpretation is that Hume analyses causal propositions, such as "A caused B", in terms of regularities in perception: "A causes B" is equivalent to "Whenever A-type events happen, B-type ones follow", where "whenever" refers to all possible perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;For this account of Hume's views on causation cf. {{harvtxt|Ayer|1946|pp=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Treatise of Human Nature'', Hume wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
power and necessity&amp;nbsp;... are&amp;nbsp;... qualities of perceptions, not of objects&amp;nbsp;... felt by the soul and not perceiv'd externally in bodies.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=167}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view is rejected by skeptical [[Philosophical realism|realists]], who argue that Hume thought that causation amounts to more than just the regular succession of events.&lt;ref name=CSW /&gt; Hume said that when two events are causally conjoined, a necessary connection underpins the conjunction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shall we rest contented with these two relations of contiguity and succession, as affording a complete idea of causation? By no means&amp;nbsp;... there is a ''necessary connexion'' to be taken into consideration.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=78|ps=, original emphasis}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Philosopher Angela Coventry writes that, for Hume, "there is nothing in any particular instance of cause and effect involving external objects which suggests the idea of power or necessary connection" and that "we are ignorant of the powers that operate between objects".{{sfn|Coventry|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gq348MmuojAC&amp;dq=hume+coventry&amp;q=%22effect+involving%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22effect%20involving%22&amp;f=false pp. 91–92]}} However, while denying the possibility of knowing the powers between objects, Hume accepted the causal principle, writing, "I never asserted so absurd a proposition as that something could arise without a cause."{{sfn|Hume|2011|p=187}}

It has been argued that, while Hume did not think causation is reducible to pure regularity, he was not a fully fledged realist either. Philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] calls this a [[quasi-realism|quasi-realist]] reading.{{sfn|Blackburn|1990|p= ?}} Blackburn writes that "Someone talking of cause is voicing a distinct mental set: he is by no means in the same state as someone merely describing regular sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by {{harvtxt|Dauer|2010|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hume's words, "nothing is more usual than to apply to external bodies every internal sensation, which they occasion".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=78, fn 17}}

===The self===
[[File:DavidHume.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Hume by [[Alexander Stoddart]] on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh]]
Empiricist philosophers, such as Hume and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], favoured the [[bundle theory]] of [[personal identity]].{{sfn|Dicker|2002|p=15}} In this theory, "the mind itself, far from being an independent power, is simply 'a bundle of perceptions' without unity or cohesive quality".{{sfn|Maurer|2013}} The self is nothing but a bundle of experiences linked by the relations of causation and resemblance; or, more accurately, that the empirically warranted idea of the self is just the idea of such a bundle. This view is forwarded by, for example, positivist interpreters, who saw Hume as suggesting that terms such as "self", "person", or "mind" referred to collections of "sense-contents".{{sfn|Ayer|1946|pp=135–136}} A modern-day version of the bundle theory of the mind has been advanced by [[Derek Parfit]] in his ''[[Reasons and Persons]]''.{{sfn|Parfit|1984|p= ?}}

However, some philosophers have criticised Hume's bundle-theory interpretation of personal identity. They argue that distinct selves can have perceptions that stand in relations of similarity and causality with one another. Thus, perceptions must already come parcelled into distinct "bundles" before they can be associated according to the relations of similarity and causality. In other words, the mind must already possess a unity that cannot be generated, or constituted, by these relations alone. Since the bundle-theory interpretation portrays Hume as answering an [[ontology|ontological]] question, philosophers, like [[Galen Strawson]], who see Hume as not very concerned with such questions have queried whether the view is really Hume's. Instead, it is suggested by Strawson that Hume might have been answering an epistemological question about the causal origin of our concept of the self.{{sfn|Strawson|2011|p= ?}} In the Appendix to the ''Treatise'', Hume declares himself dissatisfied with his earlier account of personal identity in Book 1. Philosopher Corliss Swain notes that "Commentators agree that if Hume did find some new problem" when he reviewed the section on personal identity, "he wasn't forthcoming about its nature in the Appendix."{{sfn|Swain|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qoh7_nZbBjYC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=hume+blackwell+new+problem&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SmODVNGVG8G9UeJV&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20blackwell%20new%20problem&amp;f=false p. 142]}} One interpretation of Hume's view of the self has been argued for by philosopher and psychologist [[James Giles (philosopher)|James Giles]]. According to his view, Hume is not arguing for a bundle theory, which is a form of reductionism, but rather for an eliminative view of the self. That is, rather than reducing the self to a bundle of perceptions, Hume is rejecting the idea of the self altogether. On this interpretation, Hume is proposing a "[[Personal identity#The no-self theory|no-self theory]]" and thus has much in common with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thought.{{sfn|Giles|1993|p= ?}} On this point, psychologist [[Alison Gopnik]] has argued that Hume was in a position to learn about Buddhist thought during his time in France in the 1730s.{{sfn|Gopnik|2009|p= ?}}

===Practical reason===
An essential question of practical reason for Hume was whether or not standards or principles exist (and if they do, what they are) for practical reason, that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people's intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for practical reason as a principle to exist, although other philosophers such as [[Christine Korsgaard]], [[Jean Hampton]], and [[Elijah Millgram]] claim that Hume is not so much of an anti-rationalist as he is just a skeptic of practical reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=Michelle |authorlink= Michelle Mason |volume= 31 |issue= 2 |date=September 2005 |title=Hume and Humeans on Practical Reason |url=http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v31n2/mason/mason-v31n2.pdf |publisher= [[Hume Studies]] |accessdate=2016-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume denied the existence of practical reason as a principle because he claimed reason does not have any effect on morality, since morality is capable of producing effects in people that reason alone cannot create. As Hume explains in ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1740): “Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hume |first=David|date=1740 |edition=1978|title=A Treatise of Human Nature |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon P |page=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since practical reason is supposed to regulate our actions (in theory), Hume denied practical reason on the grounds that reason cannot directly oppose passions. As Hume puts it, “Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.” Reason is less significant than any passion because reason has no original influence, while "A passion is an original existence, or, if you will, modification of existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hume |first=David|date=1740 |edition=1978 |title=A Treatise of Human Nature |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon P |page=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical reason is also concerned with the value of actions rather than the truth of propositions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=practical-reason |title=Practical Reason |last=Wallace |first=Jay |date=2014 | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; so Hume believed that reason's shortcoming of affecting morality proved that practical reason could not be authoritative for all rational beings, since morality was essential for dictating people's intentions and actions.

===Ethics===
{{see also|is–ought problem}}
Hume's writings on ethics began in the ''Treatise'' and were refined in his ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (1751). His views on ethics are that "[m]oral decisions are grounded in moral sentiment." It is not knowing that governs ethical actions, but feelings.{{sfn|Cranston|2014|p=4}} Arguing that reason cannot be behind morality, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=458}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hume's [[moral sentimentalism]] about morality was shared by his close friend Adam Smith,{{sfn|Hume|2013|p=548}}{{failed verification|date=March 2015}} and Hume and Smith were mutually influenced by the moral reflections of their older contemporary [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].{{sfn|Taylor|1965|p= ?}} [[Peter Singer]] claims that Hume's argument that morals cannot have a rational basis alone "would have been enough to earn him a place in the history of ethics".{{sfn|Singer|2015}}

Hume also put forward the [[is–ought problem]], later called ''Hume's Law'',{{sfn|Singer|2015}} denying the possibility of logically deriving what ''ought'' to be from what ''is''. He wrote in the ''Treatise'' that in every system of morality he has read, the author begins with stating facts about the world, but then suddenly is always referring to what ought to be the case. Hume demands that a reason should be given for inferring what ought to be the case, from what is the case. This because it "seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others".{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=470}}

Hume's theory of ethics has been influential in modern-day [[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical theory]],{{sfn|Edwards|2002|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=0pGKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Hume++meta-ethics+influence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zrmIVL_FE4iBUc-JgIAG&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Hume%20%20meta-ethics%20influence&amp;f=false p. 44]}} helping to inspire [[emotivism]],{{sfn|Humber|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dh-E6oIlCkAC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Hume+emotivism+influence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9LuIVIfhIIW1UaCIg_AM&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hume%20emotivism%20influence&amp;f=false p. 136]}} and ethical [[expressivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]],{{sfn|Brown|2005|pp=97–100}}{{failed verification|date=March 2015}} as well as [[Allan Gibbard]]'s general theory of moral judgment and judgments of rationality.{{sfn|Angier|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ndyMavMbiZMC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Hume++influence+gibbard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0r-IVKLZF4PwUJbrgLAJ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hume%20%20influence%20gibbard&amp;f=false p. 114]}}

===Aesthetics===
Hume's ideas about [[aesthetics]] and the [[theory of art]] are spread throughout his works, but are particularly connected with his ethical writings, and also the essays ''[[Of the Standard of Taste]]'' and ''[[Of Tragedy]]''. His views are rooted in the work of [[Joseph Addison]] and Francis Hutcheson.{{sfn|Gracyk|2011|loc= ch. 1}} In the ''Treatise'' he wrote of the connection between beauty and deformity and vice and virtue,{{sfn|Hume|1739|loc=Sect. VII and Sect VIII, pp. 295–304}} and his later writings on this subject continue to draw parallels of beauty and deformity in art, with conduct and character.{{sfn|Costelloe|2013|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=MH3_R04jW80C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=hume+aesthetics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hvGFVMcPy_5So1I&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=deformity&amp;f=false p. viii]}}

In ''Of the Standard of Taste'', Hume argues that no rules can be drawn up about what is a tasteful object. However, a reliable critic of taste can be recognised as being objective, sensible and unprejudiced, and having extensive experience.{{sfn|Harris|2013|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=zWMBAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA401&amp;dq=hume+aesthetics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AxaGVPzBHcjsUsjwgOAP&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20aesthetics&amp;f=false p. 401]}} ''Of Tragedy'' addresses the question of why humans enjoy [[tragedy|tragic drama]]. Hume was concerned with the way spectators find pleasure in the sorrow and anxiety depicted in a tragedy. He argued that this was because the spectator is aware that he is witnessing a dramatic performance. There is pleasure in realising that the terrible events that are being shown are actually fiction.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSXlNY6xIMoC&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=hume+of+tragedy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RBqGVPnpBMb9Utelg9AP&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20of%20tragedy&amp;f=false pp. 325–326]}} Furthermore, Hume laid down rules for educating people in taste and correct conduct, and his writings in this area have been very influential on English and Anglo-Saxon aesthetics.{{sfn|Scruton|2014|p=18}}

===Free will, determinism, and responsibility===
Hume, along with Thomas Hobbes, is cited as a classical [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] about the notions of [[free will|freedom]] and [[determinism]].{{sfn|McKenna|Coates|2015|loc=Ch. 3}} The thesis of compatibilism seeks to reconcile human freedom with the mechanist belief that human beings are part of a deterministic universe, whose happenings are governed by [[physical law]]s. Hume, to this end, was influenced greatly by the scientific revolution and by in particular Sir Isaac Newton.{{sfn|Wright|2010|p= ?}} Hume argued that the dispute about the compatibility of freedom and determinism has been continued over two thousand years by ambiguous terminology. He wrote: "From this circumstance alone, that a controversy has been long kept on foot&amp;nbsp;... we may presume that there is some ambiguity in the expression", and that different disputants use different meanings for the same terms.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=81}}{{sfn|Passmore|2013||loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vZRtAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=hume+presume+that+there+is+some+ambiguity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3zSMVOvlJYnyULWZhPgP&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20presume%20that%20there%20is%20some%20ambiguity&amp;f=false p. 73]}}

Hume defines the concept of necessity as "the uniformity, observable in the operations of nature; where similar objects are constantly conjoined together",{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=82}} and [[liberty]] as "a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the will".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=95}} He then argues that, according to these definitions, not only are the two compatible, but liberty ''requires'' necessity. For if our actions were not necessitated in the above sense, they would "have so little in connexion with motives, inclinations and circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of uniformity from the other". But if our actions are not thus connected to the will, then our actions can never be free: they would be matters of "chance; which is universally allowed to have no existence".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=96}} Australian philosopher [[John Passmore]] writes that confusion has arisen because "necessity" has been taken to mean "necessary connexion". Once this has been abandoned, Hume argues that "liberty and necessity will be found not to be in conflict one with another".{{sfn|Passmore|2013||loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vZRtAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=hume+presume+that+there+is+some+ambiguity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3zSMVOvlJYnyULWZhPgP&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20presume%20that%20there%20is%20some%20ambiguity&amp;f=false p. 73]}}

Moreover, Hume goes on to argue that in order to be held [[morally responsible]], it is required that our behaviour be caused or necessitated, for, as he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Actions are, by their very nature, temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some ''cause'' in the character and disposition of the person who performed them, they can neither redound to his honour, if good; nor infamy, if evil.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=98|ps=, original emphasis}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hume describes the link between causality and our capacity to rationally make a decision from this an inference of the mind. Human beings assess a situation based upon certain predetermined events and from that form a choice. Hume believes that this choice is made spontaneously. Hume calls this form of decision making the liberty of spontaneity.{{sfn|Mounce|Mounce|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qyepEVWo0v8C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=hume+liberty+of+spontaneity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bjeMVOKlG4L6UJe1gNgL&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20liberty%20of%20spontaneity&amp;f=false p. 66]}}

Education writer Richard Wright considers that Hume's position rejects a famous moral puzzle attributed to French philosopher [[Jean Buridan]]. The [[Buridan's ass]] puzzle describes a donkey that is hungry. This donkey has on both sides of him separate bales of hay, which are of equal distances from him. The problem concerns which bale the donkey chooses. Buridan was said to believe that the donkey would die, because he has no [[autonomy]]. The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no motive to choose one bale of hay over the other. However, human beings are different, because a human who is placed in a position where he is forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will make a decision to take one in lieu of the other. For Buridan, humans have the capacity of autonomy, and he recognises the choice that is ultimately made will be based on chance, as both loaves of bread are exactly the same. However, Wright says that Hume completely rejects this notion, arguing that a human will spontaneously act in such a situation because he is faced with impending death if he fails to do so. Such a decision is not made on the basis of chance, but rather on necessity and spontaneity, given the prior predetermined events leading up to the predicament.{{sfn|Wright|2010|p= ?}}

Hume's argument is supported by modern-day compatibilists such as [[R. E. Hobart]], a pseudonym of philosopher Dickinson S. Miller.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{harvtxt|Hobart|1934|p=?}} and {{harvtxt|Carroll|Markosian|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=f6bcZq4_4gUC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=hume+hobart+Free+Will+as+Involving&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vjiMVJalEcjzUIu6gdgL&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20hobart%20Free%20Will%20as%20Involving&amp;f=false p. 54, note 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[P. F. Strawson]] argued that the issue of whether we hold one another morally responsible does not ultimately depend on the truth or falsity of a metaphysical thesis such as determinism. This is because our so holding one another is a non-rational human sentiment that is not predicated on such theses.{{sfn|Strawson|2008|p=?}}{{sfn|Prasad|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=66b8FJmZQ38C&amp;dq=hume+strawson&amp;q=hume+moral%2C+reactive#v=snippet&amp;q=hume%20moral%2C%20reactive&amp;f=false p. 348]}}

===Writings on religion===
The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' states that Hume "wrote forcefully and incisively on almost every central question in the philosophy of religion." His "various writings concerning problems of religion are among the most important and influential contributions on this topic."{{sfn|Russell|2014|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/ Hume on Religion]}} His writings in this field cover the philosophy, psychology, history, and anthropology of religious thought. All of these aspects were discussed in Hume's 1757 dissertation, ''The Natural History of Religion''. Here he argued that the [[monotheistic]] religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam all derive from earlier [[polytheistic]] religions. He also suggested that all religious belief "traces, in the end, to dread of the unknown."{{sfn|O'Connor|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ntygPAezQJUC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=hume+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1s_GU_r3KPPH7Abi94GgAg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20religion&amp;f=false pp. 7–8]}} Hume had also written on religious subjects in the first ''Enquiry'', as well as later in the ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''.{{sfn|Russell|2014|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/ Ch. 1]}}

====Religious views====
Although he wrote a great deal about religion, Hume's personal views are unclear, and there has been much discussion concerning his religious position.&lt;ref&gt;E.g in {{harvtxt|Russell|2010}}, {{harvtxt|O'Connor|2013}}, and {{harvtxt|Norton|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaries considered him to be an atheist, or at least un-Christian, and the [[Church of Scotland]] seriously considered bringing charges of infidelity against him.{{sfn|Mossner|1980|p=206}} The fact that contemporaries thought that he may have been an atheist is exemplified by a story Hume liked to tell:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The best theologian he ever met, he used to say, was the old Edinburgh fishwife who, having recognized him as Hume the atheist, refused to pull him out of the bog into which he had fallen until he declared he was a Christian and repeated the Lord's prayer.{{sfn|Scharfstein|1998|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iZQy2lu70bwC&amp;pg=PA454&amp;dq=hume++fishwives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wi3KU6jOGMaM7AaRoIDYBQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20%20fishwives&amp;f=false p. 454, footnote]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in works such as ''Of Superstition and Enthusiasm'', Hume specifically seems to support the standard religious views of his time and place. This still meant that he could be very critical of the [[Catholic Church]], dismissing it with the standard [[Protestant]] accusations of superstition and idolatry,{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=51}}{{sfn|Hume|1741|p=70}} as well as dismissing as idolatry what his compatriots saw as uncivilised beliefs.{{sfn|Hume|1757|p=34}} He also considered extreme Protestant sects, the members of which he called "enthusiasts", to be corrupters of religion.{{sfn|Hume|1741|pp=73–76}} By contrast, in his ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]'', Hume presented arguments suggesting that [[polytheism]] had much to commend it over [[monotheism]].{{sfn|Hume|1757|p=63}}

Philosopher [[Paul Russell (philosopher)|Paul Russell]] writes that it is likely that Hume was sceptical about religious belief, but not to the extent of complete atheism.  He suggests that perhaps Hume's position is best characterised by the term "irreligion",{{sfn|Russell|2010|pp=202, 204–205, and 284}} while philosopher David O'Connor argues that Hume's final position was "weakly [[deistic]]". For O'Connor, Hume's "position is deeply ironic. This is because, while inclining towards a weak form of [[deism]], he seriously doubts that we can ever find a sufficiently favourable balance of evidence to justify accepting any religious position." He adds that Hume "did not believe in the God of standard theism&amp;nbsp;... but he did not rule out all concepts of deity", and that "ambiguity suited his purposes, and this creates difficulty in definitively pinning down his final position on religion".{{sfn|O'Connor|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ntygPAezQJUC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=%22but+he+did+not+rule+out+all+concepts+of+deity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ulLs4-GWED&amp;sig=XcJNdJXP3jP-N0ynFZ8wroDbAUg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CtwmVd-BKueP7AbA14CYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22but%20he%20did%20not%20rule%20out%20all%20concepts%20of%20deity%22&amp;f=false pp.11, 19]}}

====Design argument====
One of the traditional topics of [[natural theology]] is that of the [[existence of God]], and one of the ''[[a posteriori]]'' arguments for this is the ''argument from design'' or the [[teleological argument]]. The argument is that the existence of God can be proved by the design that is obvious in the complexity of the world. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' states that this is "the most popular, because [it is] the most accessible of the theistic arguments&amp;nbsp;... which identifies evidences of design in nature, inferring from them a divine designer&amp;nbsp;... The fact that the universe as a whole is a coherent and efficiently functioning system likewise, in this view, indicates a divine intelligence behind it."&lt;ref name = RE&gt;[[#{{harvid|RE}}|RE]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2015}}

In ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Hume wrote that the design argument seems to depend upon our experience, and its proponents "always suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=148}} Philosopher Louise E. Loeb notes that Hume is saying that only experience and observation can be our guide to making inferences about the conjunction between events. However, according to Hume, "we observe neither God nor other universes, and hence no conjunction involving them. There is no observed conjunction to ground an inference either to extended objects or to God, as unobserved causes."{{sfn|Loeb|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ECxW_2tAf0C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=companion+hume+observe+neither+God+nor+other+universes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z0OMVMfjJob1UvykgLAN&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=companion%20hume%20observe%20neither%20God%20nor%20other%20universes&amp;f=false p. 118]}}

Hume also criticised the argument in his ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion'' (1779). In this, he suggested that, even if the world is a more or less smoothly functioning system, this may only be a result of the "chance permutations of particles falling into a temporary or permanent self-sustaining order, which thus has the appearance of design."&lt;ref name=RE /&gt;

A century later, the idea of order without design was rendered more plausible by Charles Darwin's discovery that the adaptations of the forms of life are a result of the [[natural selection]] of inherited characteristics.&lt;ref name=RE /&gt; For philosopher James D. Madden, it is "Hume, rivaled only by Darwin, [who] has done the most to undermine in principle our confidence in arguments from design among all figures in the Western intellectual tradition."{{sfn|Madden|2005|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=UKSZeRnuyjAC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=teleological+god+hume+darwin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FvrIU4uBMYOu7AaV1oGQCw&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=teleological%20god%20hume%20darwin&amp;f=false p. 150, emphasis removed.]}}

Finally, Hume discussed a version of the [[anthropic principle]], which is the idea that theories of the universe are constrained by the need to allow for man's existence in it as an observer. Hume has his sceptical mouthpiece Philo suggest that there may have been many worlds, produced by an incompetent designer, whom he called a "stupid mechanic". In his ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion'', Hume wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many worlds might have been botched and bungled throughout an eternity, ere this system was struck out: much labour lost: many fruitless trials made: and a slow, but continued improvement carried on during infinite ages in the art of world-making.{{sfn|Hume|1779|p=167}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

American philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] has suggested that this mechanical explanation of teleology, although "obviously&amp;nbsp;... an amusing philosophical fantasy", anticipated the notion of natural selection, the 'continued improvement' being like "any Darwinian selection algorithm."{{sfn|Dennett|2009|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=i1tNI9646Q4C&amp;pg=PA620&amp;dq=hume++anthropic+principle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4zXKU_nGCqaw7Aa-w4GAAg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20%20anthropic%20principle&amp;f=false pp. 620–621]}}

====Problem of miracles====
{{main|Of Miracles}}

In his discussion of [[miracle]]s, Hume argues that we should not believe that miracles have occurred and that they do not therefore provide us with any reason to think that God exists.{{sfn|Bailey|O'Brien|2006|p=101}} In ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' (Section 10), Hume defines a miracle as "a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent". Hume says that we believe an event that has frequently occurred is likely to occur again, but we also take into account those instances where the event did not occur. Hume wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A wise man [...] considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments [...] A hundred instances or experiments on one side, and fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any event; though a hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is contradictory, reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases, we must balance the opposite experiments [...] and deduct the smaller number from the greater, in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence.{{sfn|Hume|1777|pp=110–111}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hume discusses the testimony of those who report miracles. He wrote that testimony might be doubted even from some great authority in case the facts themselves are not credible. "[T]he evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=113}}

Although Hume leaves open the possibility for miracles to occur and be reported, he offers various arguments against this ever having happened in history:{{sfn|Hume|1777|pp=116–131|ps=, Part II of Section X}} He points out that people often lie, and they have good reasons to lie about miracles occurring either because they believe they are doing so for the benefit of their religion or because of the fame that results. Furthermore, people by nature enjoy relating miracles they have heard without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are easily transmitted even where false. Also, Hume notes that miracles seem to occur mostly in "ignorant and barbarous nations"{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=119}} and times, and the reason they do not occur in the civilised societies is such societies are not awed by what they know to be natural events. Finally, the miracles of each religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit Hume's requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the other less likely.{{sfn|Bailey|O'Brien|2006|pp=105–108}}

Hume was extremely pleased with his argument against miracles in his ''Enquiry''. He states "I flatter myself, that I have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=110}} Thus, Hume's argument against miracles had a more abstract basis founded upon the scrutiny, not just primarily of miracles, but of all forms of belief systems. It is a common sense notion of veracity based upon epistemological evidence, and founded on a principle of rationality, proportionality and reasonability.{{sfn|Bailey|O'Brien|2006|pp=105–108}}

The criterion for assessing a belief system for Hume is based on the balance of probability whether something is more likely than not to have occurred. Since the weight of empirical experience contradicts the notion for the existence of miracles, such accounts should be treated with scepticism. Further, the myriad of accounts of miracles contradict one another, as some people who receive miracles will aim to prove the authority of Jesus, whereas others will aim to prove the authority of Muhammad or some other religious prophet or deity. These various differing accounts weaken the overall evidential power of miracles.{{sfn| Ahluwalia|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-PCV11VQ8PYC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=%22Understanding+Philosophy+of+Religion%22+hume&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6qs4Vbe4EofXPeywgbgN&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Understanding%20Philosophy%20of%20Religion%22%20hume&amp;f=false pp.104–106]}}{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}

Despite all this, Hume observes that belief in miracles is popular, and that "The gazing populace [...] receive greedily, without examination, whatever soothes superstition, and promotes wonder."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=126}}

Critics have argued that Hume's position assumes the character of miracles and [[natural law]]s prior to any specific examination of miracle claims, thus it amounts to a subtle form of [[begging the question]]. To assume that testimony is a homogeneous reference group seems unwise- to compare private miracles with public miracles, unintellectual observers with intellectual observers and those who have little to gain and much to lose with those with much to gain and little to lose is not convincing to many. Indeed, many have argued that miracles not only do not contradict the laws of nature, but require the laws of nature to be intelligible as miraculous, and thus subverting the law of nature. For example, William Adams remarks that "there must be an ordinary course of nature before anything can be extraordinary. There must be a stream before anything can be interrupted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/essayinanswertom00adamiala#page/14/mode/2up |title=An essay in answer to Mr. Hume's Essay on miracles |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also noted that it requires an appeal to inductive inference, as none have observed every part of nature nor examined every possible miracle claim, for instance those in the future. This, in Hume's philosophy, was especially problematic.{{sfn|Levine|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fC3-d89f7qoC&amp;dq=hume+miracle+criticism&amp;q=%22hume+with+a+glaring%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22hume%20with%20a%20glaring%22&amp;f=false p. 3]}}

Of Campbell, it is rumoured that, having read Campbell's Dissertation, Hume remarked that "the Scotch theologue had beaten him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=George Campbell |url=http://historicalapologetics.org/campbell-george/ |title=Campbell, George « Library of Historical Apologetics |publisher=Historicalapologetics.org |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's main argument concerning miracles is that miracles by definition are singular events that differ from the established laws of nature. Such natural laws are codified as a result of past experiences. Therefore, a miracle is a violation of all prior experience and thus incapable on this basis of reasonable belief. However, the probability that something has occurred in contradiction of all past experience should always be judged to be less than the probability that either ones senses have deceived one, or the person recounting the miraculous occurrence is lying or mistaken. Hume would say, all of which he had past experience of. For Hume, this refusal to grant credence does not guarantee correctness. He offers the example of an Indian Prince, who, having grown up in a hot country, refuses to believe that water has frozen. By Hume's lights, this refusal is not wrong and the Prince "reasoned justly"; it is presumably only when he has had extensive experience of the freezing of water that he has warrant to believe that the event could occur.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=113}}

So for Hume, either the miraculous event will become a recurrent event or else it will never be rational to believe it occurred. The connection to religious belief is left unexplained throughout, except for the close of his discussion where Hume notes the reliance of Christianity upon testimony of miraculous occurrences. He makes an ironic remark that anyone who "is moved by faith to assent" to revealed testimony "is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=131|ps=, emphasis removed}}{{sfn|MacKie|1982|p=29}} Hume writes that "All the testimony which ever was really given for any miracle, or ever will be given, is a subject of derision."{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=113}}

===As historian of England===
[[File:David Hume 2.jpg|thumb| David Hume by [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], 1766]]
From 1754 to 1762 Hume published ''The History of England'', a 6-volume work, which extends, says its subtitle, "From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688". Inspired by [[Voltaire]]'s sense of the breadth of history, Hume widened the focus of the field away from merely kings, parliaments, and armies, to literature and science as well. He argued that the quest for liberty was the highest standard for judging the past, and concluded that after considerable fluctuation, England at the time of his writing had achieved "the most entire system of liberty that was ever known amongst mankind".&lt;ref&gt;Hume's History of England, vol, 6, p. 531 cited in {{harvtxt|Kenyon|1984|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; It "must be regarded as an event of cultural importance. In its own day, moreover, it was an innovation, soaring high above its very few predecessors."{{sfn|Jessop|2015}}

Hume's coverage of the political upheavals of the 17th century relied in large part on the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]]'s ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England'' (1646–69). Generally, Hume took a moderate [[royalist]] position and considered revolution unnecessary to achieve necessary reform. Hume was considered a Tory historian, and emphasised religious differences more than constitutional issues. Laird Okie explains that "Hume preached the virtues of political moderation, but&amp;nbsp;... it was moderation with an anti-Whig, pro-royalist coloring."{{sfn|Okie|1985|p=16}} For "Hume shared the&amp;nbsp;... Tory belief that the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] were no more high-handed than their Tudor predecessors".{{sfn|Okie|1985|p=25}} "Even though Hume wrote with an anti-Whig animus, it is, paradoxically, correct to regard the ''History'' as an establishment work, one which implicitly endorsed the ruling oligarchy".{{sfn|Okie|1985|p=27}}
Historians have debated whether Hume posited a universal unchanging human nature, or allowed for evolution and development.{{sfn|Wertz|1975|p=?}}

Robert Roth argues that Hume's histories display his biases against [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]s and [[Puritan]]s. Roth says his anti-Whig pro-monarchy position diminished the influence of his work, and that his emphasis on politics and religion led to a neglect of social and economic history.{{sfn|Roth|1991|p=?}}

Hume was an early cultural [[history of science|historian of science]]. His short biographies of leading scientists explored the process of scientific change. He developed new ways of seeing scientists in the context of their times by looking at how they interacted with society and each other. He covers over forty scientists, with special attention paid to [[Francis Bacon]], [[Robert Boyle]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. Hume particularly praised [[William Harvey]], writing about his treatise of the circulation of the blood: "Harvey is entitled to the glory of having made, by reasoning alone, without any mixture of accident, a capital discovery in one of the most important branches of science".{{sfn|Wertz|1993|p=?}}

The ''History'' became a best-seller and made Hume a wealthy man who no longer had to take up salaried work for others.{{sfn|Morris|Brown|2011|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/hume/#LifWor Chapter Life and Works]}} It was influential for nearly a century, despite competition from imitations by [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]] (1757), [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]] (1771) and others. By 1894, there were at least 50 editions as well as abridgements for students, and illustrated pocket editions, probably produced specifically for women.{{sfn|Phillipson|2012|p=131}}

===Political theory===
{{Utilitarianism}}
It is difficult to categorise Hume's political affiliations. His writings contain elements that are, in modern terms, both conservative and liberal,{{sfn|Dees|2010|p=403}} although these terms are anachronistic. [[Thomas Jefferson]] banned the ''History'' from [[University of Virginia]], feeling that it had "spread universal toryism over the land".&lt;ref&gt;so quoted in {{harvtxt|Livingston|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[Samuel Johnson]] thought Hume "a Tory by chance&amp;nbsp;... for he has no principle. If he is anything, he is a Hobbist", a follower of [[Thomas Hobbes]].{{sfn|Hume|1888|loc=note 13 to letter LXXXIV}} A major concern of Hume's political philosophy is the importance of the rule of law. He also stresses throughout his political essays the importance of moderation in politics: public spirit and regard to the community.{{sfn|Forbes|1985|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PX86AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=politics+moderation+hume&amp;q=politics+moderation+hume+detested#v=snippet&amp;q=politics%20moderation%20hume%20detested&amp;f=false p. 150]}}

This outlook needs to be seen within the historical context of 18th-century Scotland. Here, the legacy of religious civil war, combined with the relatively recent memory of the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings, fostered in a historian such as Hume a distaste for enthusiasm and factionalism. These appeared to threaten the fragile and nascent political and social stability of a country that was deeply politically and religiously divided.{{sfn|Wiley|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q94tuawjdYUC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=hume+enthusiasm&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r6vjU73yDKbD7AaP54GYAQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20enthusiasm&amp;f=false p. 211]}}{{failed verification|date=August 2015}} Hume thought that society is best governed by a general and impartial system of laws; he is less concerned about the form of government that administers these laws, so long as it does so fairly. However, he does write that a republic must produce laws, while "monarchy, when absolute, contains even something repugnant to law."{{sfn|Hume|1741|p=119}}

Hume expressed suspicion of attempts to reform society in ways that departed from long-established custom, and he counselled peoples not to resist their governments except in cases of the most egregious tyranny.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=550}} However, he resisted aligning himself with either of Britain's two political parties, the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[Tory|Tories]]. Hume wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My views of ''things'' are more conformable to Whig principles; my representations of ''persons'' to Tory prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;so quoted in {{harvtxt|Mossner|1980|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7HXJAqqNl4QC&amp;q=whig#v=snippet&amp;q=whig&amp;f=false p. 311]}}, original emphasis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Canadian philosopher Neil McArthur writes that Hume believed that we should try to balance our demands for liberty with the need for strong authority, without sacrificing either. McArthur characterises Hume as a "precautionary conservative",{{sfn|McArthur|2007|p=124}} whose actions would have been "determined by prudential concerns about the consequences of change, which often demand we ignore our own principles about what is ideal or even legitimate."{{sfn|McArthur|2007}}{{failed verification|date=October 2015}} Hume supported the [[freedom of the press|liberty of the press]], and was sympathetic to democracy, when suitably constrained. American historian [[Douglass Adair]] has argued that Hume was a major inspiration for [[James Madison]]'s writings, and the essay "[[Federalist No. 10]]" in particular.{{sfn|Adair|1957|p=?}}

Hume offered his view on the best type of society in an essay titled "Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth", which lays out what he thought was the best form of government. He hoped that, "in some future age, an opportunity might be afforded of reducing the theory to practice, either by a dissolution of some old government, or by the combination of men to form a new one, in some distant part of the world". He defended a strict [[separation of powers]], [[decentralization|decentralisation]], extending the [[Suffrage|franchise]] to anyone who held property of value and limiting the power of the clergy. The system of the [[military of Switzerland|Swiss militia]] was proposed as the best form of protection. Elections were to take place on an annual basis and representatives were to be unpaid.{{sfn|Hume|1987}} Political philosophers [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Joseph Cropsey]], writing of Hume's thoughts about "the wise statesman", note that he "will bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age". Also, if he wishes to improve a constitution, his innovations will take account of the "ancient fabric", in order not to disturb society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7mScxst9UoC&amp;dq=History+of+Political+Philosophy&amp;q=%22limits+of+human+foresight%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22limits%20of%20human%20foresight%22&amp;f=false |title=Strauss, L. and Cropsey, J., '&amp;#39;History of Political Philosophy'&amp;#39;, University of Chicago Press, 2012, p. 556 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2012-06-15 |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the political analysis of philosopher [[George Holland Sabine|George Sabine]], the scepticism of Hume extended to the doctrine of [[consent of the governed|government by consent]]. He notes that "allegiance is a habit enforced by education and consequently as much a part of human nature as any other motive."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sabine|Sabine, GH.]], ''A History of Political Theory'', Dryden Press, 1973 (1937), p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1770s, Hume was critical of British policies toward the American colonies and advocated for American independence.  He wrote in 1771 that "our union with America... in the nature of things, cannot long subsist".&lt;ref name=wsj11042017 /&gt;

===Contributions to economic thought===
[[File:David_Hume_and_Adam_Smith_statues,_Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Statues of David Hume and [[Adam Smith]] by David Watson Stevenson on the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] in Edinburgh]]
Hume noted his views as economist in his ''Political Discourses'', which were incorporated in ''Essays and Treatises'' as Part II of ''Essays, Moral and Political''.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-Hume#toc12268|title=David Hume {{!}} Scottish philosopher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To what extent he was influenced by Adam Smith is difficult to stress, however both of them had similar principles supported from historical events.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"/&gt;  At the same time Hume did not demonstrate concrete system of economic theory which could be observed in Smith's [[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]. However, he introduced several new ideas  around which the “classical economics” of the 18th century was built.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"/&gt; Through his discussions on politics, Hume developed many ideas that are prevalent in the field of economics. This includes ideas on [[private property]], inflation, and [[international trade|foreign trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Lionel ''A History of Economic Thought: The LSE Lectures'' edited by Medema and Samuels. Ch 11 and 12&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to his essay "[[Of the Balance of Trade]]", economist [[Paul Krugman]] has remarked that "David Hume created what I consider the first true economic model."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=How We Know The Earth Is Old|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com//2012/11/20/how-we-know-the-earth-is-old/|work=The New York Times|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Locke, Hume believes that private property is not a natural right. Hume argues it is justified, because resources are limited. Private property would be an unjustified, "idle ceremonial", if all goods were unlimited and available freely.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, H. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kw5vLbYq-4C&amp;pg=PA322&amp;dq=hume+idle+ceremonial&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=plOMVOCrMozuaMjCgqgD&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20idle%20ceremonial&amp;f=false ''Understanding the Global Economy''], Peace Education Books, 2004, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume also believed in an unequal distribution of property, because perfect equality would destroy the ideas of thrift and industry. Perfect equality would thus lead to impoverishment.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David ''An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals'' (1751)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, JB., [https://books.google.com/books?id=MTYABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=hume+private+property&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hlKMVLXeHtfwaLf1gagD&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=hume%20private%20property&amp;f=false ''Opinion and Reform in Hume's Political Philosophy''], Princeton University Press, 2014, pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

Due to Hume's vast influence on contemporary philosophy, a large number of approaches in contemporary philosophy and cognitive science are today called "Humean."&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Don, ''Hume (The Routledge Philosophers)'', Routledge -Reprint edition, 2014, p. ? {{ISBN|978-0415283342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attention to Hume's philosophical works grew after the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]'' (1783), credited Hume with awakening him from his "dogmatic slumber".&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I., ''Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics'': 'Introduction'&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], "there is more to be learned from each page of David Hume than from the collected philosophical works of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]] and [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]] taken together."&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=OHIJgObqoXoC&amp;dq=Schopenhauer+World+as+Will+and+Representation+volume+2+hume&amp;q=page+hume+together#v=snippet&amp;q=page%20hume%20together&amp;f=false ''The World as Will and Representation''], Vol. 2, Ch. 46, p. 582.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. J. Ayer]], while introducing his classic exposition of logical positivism in 1936, claimed: "The views which are put forward in this treatise derive from&amp;nbsp;... doctrines&amp;nbsp;... which are themselves the logical outcome of the empiricism of Berkeley and David Hume."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3M3ycPeuRNoC&amp;dq=ayer+truth&amp;q=%22The+views%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22The%20views%22&amp;f=false Ayer, AJ., ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', London, Preface to First Edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]], in 1915, wrote that he was inspired by Hume's positivism when formulating his theory of [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, A., in a letter of 14 December 1915, to Moritz Schlick (Papers, A, Vol. 8A, Doc.165)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's problem of induction was also of fundamental importance to the philosophy of Karl Popper. In his autobiography, ''Unended Quest'', he wrote: "Knowledge&amp;nbsp;... is ''objective''; and it is hypothetical or conjectural. This way of looking at the problem made it possible for me to reformulate Hume's ''problem of induction''". This insight resulted in Popper's major work ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., [https://books.google.com/books?id=YmoQBAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Hume+Unended+Quest&amp;q=%22is+hypothetical+or+conjectural%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22is%20hypothetical%20or%20conjectural%22&amp;f=false ''Unended Quest; An Intellectual Autobiography''], 1976, pp. 95–96, {{ISBN|0-415-28590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in his ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I approached the problem of induction through Hume. Hume, I felt, was perfectly right in pointing out that induction cannot be logically justified.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., [https://books.google.com/books?id=zXh9AwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=popper+conjectures&amp;q=%22approached+the+problem%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22approached%20the%20problem%22&amp;f=false ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge''], Routledge, 2014, . 55.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The writings of Scottish philosopher and contemporary of Hume, [[Thomas Reid]], were often criticisms of Hume's scepticism. Reid formulated his [[common sense]] philosophy in part as a reaction against Hume's views.&lt;ref&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reid/#ComSenFirPri "Thomas Reid"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume influenced and was influenced by the Christian philosopher [[Joseph Butler]]. Hume was impressed by Butler's way of thinking about religion, and Butler may well have been influenced by Hume's writings.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=8zTVtbQQuKsC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=butler+hume&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wkWLVNOLN4T6ULC9hPgJ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=butler%20hume&amp;f=false ''Philosophy and Religion in Enlightenment Britain: New Case Studies''], Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= plat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/hume-religion/ |title=Hume on Religion |author=Paul Russel |date=17 May 2010 |work=First published October 4, 2005 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition) |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's [[rationalism]] in religious subjects influenced, via German-Scottish theologian [[Johann Joachim Spalding]], the German [[neology]] school and [[rational theology]], and contributed to the transformation of German theology in the [[age of enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Schröter: Transformationen des Theologiebegriffes in der Aufklärung.

Danish theologian and philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] adopted "Hume's suggestion that the role of reason is not to make us wise but to reveal our ignorance." However, Kierkegaard took this as a reason for the necessity of religious faith, or [[fideism]]. The "fact that Christianity is contrary to reason ... is the necessary precondition for true faith." Political theorist [[Isaiah Berlin]], for example, has pointed out the similarities between the arguments of Hume and Kierkegaard against [[rational theology]].&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;Miles, T.

According to philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]], Hume's ''Treatise'' is "the founding document of [[cognitive science]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/writers/philosophers/david-hume.html|title=David Hume Biography|work=Biography Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume engaged with contemporary intellectual luminaries such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[James Boswell]], and [[Adam Smith]] (who acknowledged Hume's influence on his economics and [[political philosophy]]).

[[Isaiah Berlin]] once said of Hume that "No man has influenced the history of philosophy to a deeper or more disturbing degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philosophynow.org/podcasts/Impressions_of_David_Hume|title=Impressions of David Hume - Podcasts - Philosophy Now|work=philosophynow.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects'' (1739–40). Hume intended to see whether the [https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ ''Treatise of Human Nature''] met with success, and if so to complete it with books devoted to Politics and Criticism. However, it did not meet with success. As Hume himself said, "It fell ''dead-born from the press'', without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots"{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=352}} and so was not completed.
* ''An Abstract of a Book lately Published: Entitled A Treatise of Human Nature etc''. (1740) Anonymously published, but almost certainly written by Hume&lt;ref&gt;For this see the introduction by J. M. Keynes and P. Sraffa in: Hume, David (1965). ''An Abstract of A Treatise of Human Nature 1740. Connecticut: Archon Books&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to popularise his ''Treatise''. Of considerable philosophical interest, because it spells out what he considered "The Chief Argument" of the ''Treatise'', in a way that seems to anticipate the structure of the ''Enquiry concerning Human Understanding''.
* ''[[Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary]]'' (first ed. 1741–2) A collection of pieces written and published over many years, though most were collected together in 1753–4. Many of the essays are focused on topics in politics and economics, though they also range over questions of [[aesthetics|aesthetic judgement]], love, marriage and polygamy, and the demographics of ancient Greece and Rome, to name just a few of the topics considered. The Essays show some influence from [[Joseph Addison|Addison]]'s ''Tatler'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', which Hume read avidly in his youth.
* ''A Letter from a Gentleman to His Friend in Edinburgh: Containing Some Observations on a Specimen of the Principles concerning Religion and Morality, said to be maintain'd in a Book lately publish'd, intituled A Treatise of Human Nature etc''. Edinburgh (1745). Contains a letter written by Hume to defend himself against charges of atheism and scepticism, while applying for a chair at Edinburgh University.
* ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1748) Contains reworking of the main points of the ''Treatise'', Book 1, with the addition of material on free will (adapted from Book 2), miracles, the Design Argument, and mitigated scepticism. ''[[Of Miracles]]'', section X of the ''Enquiry'', was often published separately.
* ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (1751) A reworking of material from Book 3 of the ''Treatise'', on morality, but with a significantly different emphasis. It "was thought by Hume to be the best of his writings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoI6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA548&amp;dq=david+hume++essay+concerning+morals+best+work&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0kLhU-74D5Ge7Aar4oCoBg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20hume%20%20essay%20concerning%20morals%20best%20work&amp;f=false |title=Samson, G., '&amp;#39;The Concise Cambridge History of English Literature'&amp;#39;, CUP Archive, 1941, p. 548 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Political Discourses'', (part II of ''[[Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary]]'' within vol. 1 of the larger ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects'') Edinburgh (1752). Included in ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects'' (1753–56) reprinted 1758–77.
* ''Political Discourses''/''Discours politiques'' (1752–1758), ''My Own life'' (1776), ''Of Essay writing'', 1742. Bilingual English-French (translated by Fabien Grandjean). Mauvezin, France: Trans-Europ-Repress, 1993, 22&amp;nbsp;cm, V-260 p. Bibliographic notes, index.
* ''[[Four Dissertations]]'' London (1757). Included in reprints of ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects'' (above).
* ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]'' (Sometimes referred to as ''The History of Great Britain'') (1754–62) More a category of books than a single work, Hume's history spanned "from the invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution of 1688" and went through over 100 editions. Many considered it ''the'' standard history of England in its day.
* ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]''. Included in "Four Dissertations" (1757)
* "Sister Peg" (1760) Hume claimed to have authored an anonymous political pamphlet satirizing the failure of the British Parliament to create a Scottish militia in 1760. Although the authorship of the work is disputed, Hume wrote Dr. Alexander Carlyle in early 1761 claiming authorship. The readership of the time attributed the work to [[Adam Ferguson]], a friend and associate of Hume's who has been sometimes called "the founder of modern sociology." Some contemporary scholars concur in the judgment that Ferguson, not Hume, was the author of this work.
* "My Own Life" (1776) Penned in April, shortly before his death, this autobiography was intended for inclusion in a new edition of ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects''. It was first published by Adam Smith who claimed that by doing so he had incurred "ten times more abuse than the very violent attack I had made upon the whole commercial system of Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7Bef_1f_w0C&amp;pg=PA466&amp;dq=david+hume++%22ten+times+more+abuse+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PUThU9oelI3sBr2PgIgE&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20hume%20%20%22ten%20times%20more%20abuse%20%22&amp;f=false |title=Berry, CJ., Paganelli, MP. and Smith, C., '&amp;#39;The Oxford Handbook of Adam Smith'&amp;#39;, Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 466 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2013-05-16 |accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) Published posthumously by his nephew, David Hume the Younger. Being a discussion among three fictional characters concerning the nature of God, and is an important portrayal of the argument from design. Despite some controversy, most scholars agree that the view of Philo, the most sceptical of the three, comes closest to Hume's own.

'''''Diana Bathing with her Nymphs with Actaeon and Callisto''''' is a 1634 painting by the Dutch painter [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]. It is now on show in the [[Salm-Salm]] princely collection in the Wasserburg Anholt in [[Anholt, Germany|Anholt]], [[Germany]].

It shows two episodes from [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', in both of which someone is punished by the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] for a sexual offence. On the left, [[Actaeon]] is punished for seeing the goddess naked by being turned into a stag and killed by his own hounds. On the right, Diana's other nymphs are tearing off [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]'s clothing to reveal how she has broken her vow of chastity and is now carrying [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]'s child - Diana expels her from her court and she later gives birth to [[Arcas]] before being turned into a bear by [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], whom Arcas almost kills whilst hunting.

Unusually, the painting also includes an image of an elderly couple unrelated to either of the two stories (background) and a middle-aged nymph (in the foreground).

'''Diana Conyngham Ellis''' (née Monsell) (1813 - 4 May 1851) was a [[botany|botanical]] artist from [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Patricia|title=Irish Botanical Illustrators &amp; Flower Painters|date=2000|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Suffolk|isbn=9781851493579|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Diana Monsell was born, most probably in [[County Londonderry]], in 1813. She was the eldest daughter of the four children of the Archdeacon of Derry, Thomas Bewley Monsell, and Jane Rae. Her brother was the clergyman and hymn-writer, [[John Samuel Bewley Monsell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Bewlay Monsell|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p15876.htm#i158753|website=The Peerage|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married Conyngham Ellis, her first cousin, on 29 December 1842 at Dunloe Church. Initially a barrister, Conyngham Ellis left the profession to become a vicar, serving in Cranbourne, Windsor, Berkshire. Ellis died aged 37 or 38, on 4 May 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diana Monsell|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p15873.htm#i158722|website=The Peerage|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book by Ellis as Mrs Conyngham Ellis, ''Conversations on human nature for the young'', appears to have been printed posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sinfulness of Little Sins: A Course of Sermons Preached in Lent|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Sinfulness_of_Little_Sins_1000299605/173|website=Forgotten Books|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A watercolour portrait of Ellis by [[Frederick William Burton]] is in the collections of the [[National Gallery of Ireland]].&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt;
 
==Artistic work==
Ellis' body of work consists of 68 flower and foliage water colour drawings. It is not known if Ellis received any form of training, though her work is typical of its time. Her studies were of common local plants, mostly those found in fields and hedgerows, such as primroses, bluebells, and violets. The work has been lauded for its accuracy and realism.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt;&lt;ref name=Newmann&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newmann|first1=Kate|title=Diana Monsell (1813 - 1851): Artist|url=http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk/index.php/home/viewPerson/1179|website=The Dictionary of Ulster Biography|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mounted album of her work is held in the collections of the National Gallery of Ireland. Burton commented on her work: "I have not for a long time seen anything that gave me so much pleasure to dwell on ... they make my own work appear rude and false that I am more than ever alive to my defects."&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2639">The '''Earth Group''' ([[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Grupa Zemlja'') was a Croatian [[arts collective]] active in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from 1929 to 1935. The group aimed to defend their artistic independence against foreign influences such as [[Impressionism]] or [[Neoclassicism]] and ''[[art for art's sake]]''. They maintained that art should mirror the social milieu from which it springs and should meet contemporary needs, hence their emphasis on the popularization of art, both at home and abroad. In spite of its ideologically heterogeneous membership, the group was considered [[Marxism|Marxist]] in orientation but never espoused [[socialist realism]].

==Members and guests==

'''Eugene Abeshaus''' (also spelled ''Evgeny Abezgauz'', ''Евгений Абезгауз'' in Russian; 1939–2008) was a Jewish artist who worked in Russia (then USSR) and Israel.  

Born in Leningrad to a typical intelligentsia family, Abeshaus was educated as an electrical engineer but soon abandoned this career and enrolled in the Mukhina School for Applied Art. By the time of his graduation from the famous “Mukha” (''Fly'' in Russian), he had already developed a critical stance towards the official Soviet art dominated by the Communist ideology and began exhibiting at semi-underground exhibitions. This was culminated by his taking part in a famous 1975 exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture. Abeshaus was fired from his job and censured by the official press – which however admitted his "artistic taste, a good sense of color and form". 

Soon afterwards, Abeshaus set up, together with several Jewish artists, the Alef Group and became its leader. The group’s first exhibition in November 1975 was held at Abeshauses’ small apartment. According to the Alef Manifesto written by Alec Rappoport, “We are trying to conquer the influence of small-town Jewish art and find sources for our work in deeper, wiser, and more spiritual European culture, and from it build a bridge to today and tomorrow". 

In May 1976, some of Abeshaus’s works, clandestinely sneaked out of the country, were exhibited at the [[Berkeley Art Museum]] to much critical acclaim. Later in the same year, following some political bargain between Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Abeshaus and his family were finally permitted to leave the USSR for Israel.   

Since then Abeshaus lived and worked in [[Ein Hod]], a picturesque artists’ village near Haifa founded by [[Marcel Janco]]. His works were exhibited at numerous exhibitions, including dozens one-artist shows, in Israel, USA, Europe and, after the collapse of the USSR, in Russia. His ultimate acceptance and recognition there was culminated in a sensational memorial one-artist exhibition staged in 2009 at the famous [[Russian Museum]] in St.Petersburg - an exceptional honor for a modern artist.

He resides in [[Monaco]], and has four children, including the British art dealer [[Helly Nahmad (London)|Helly Nahmad]].&lt;ref name=ft-article&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e9cbe436-0a15-11e1-85ca-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2cXQfIZiD |author=Jackie Wullschlager|work=[[Financial Times]]|title=Lunch with the FT: Helly Nahmad | date=| accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[Forbes]]'' estimated that Ezra, together with his brother [[David Nahmad|David]] have built an art collection worth $3–4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/news/2012-12-18/giuseppe-nahmad-obituary/ |work=[[Art in America]]|title=Mega-Collector and Dealer Giuseppe Nahmad Died in November|author=Sarah Cascone| date=December 18, 2012| accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ezra was born in [[Aleppo]], Syria to a [[Syrian Jews|Syrian Jewish]] family. The roots of the Nahmad family are in Aleppo, where his father, [[Sephardic Jewish]] banker Hillel Nahmad lived until just after World War II .&lt;ref name=ft-article/&gt; Following the Syrian [[anti-Jewish]] violence in 1949, his father moved to  [[Beirut]], Lebanon, where Ezra and his brothers sold English novels to US sailors stationed in Lebanon. In the early 1960s, With the rise of Palestinian threat against the [[Lebanese Republic]], Ezra's father took him and his brothers, [[Giuseppe Nahmad|Joseph (Giuseppe)]], [[David Nahmad|David]], to [[Milan]], Italy. As teenagers, the three began to deal in art - and skipped school to trade on the Italian stock market.&lt;ref name=ft-article/&gt;

==Career==
Ezra's first career milestone is believed to have taken place at a [[Juan Gris]] exhibition in [[Rome]], organized by cubist dealer [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]. Ezra and his brother bought two works – the only pieces sold. Kahnweiler befriended them, selling them works by [[Picasso]], [[Braque]], and Gris. With the emergence of the [[Red Brigades]] terror group in the 1970s, Milan was perceived as too dangerous, and the family moved again. Ezra and his brother Joseph headed for Monaco, and David to New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.artlyst.com/articles/gallerist-helly-nahmad-arrested-for-suspected-gambling-related-money-laundering |work=|title= Gallerist Helly Nahmad Arrested For Suspected Gambling Related Money Laundering| date=April 17, 2013|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, Ezra and his brother David are considered influential "mega-dealers" of modern and impressionist art by the most well-known names, from [[Monet]] and [[Matisse]] to [[Renoir]] and [[Rothko]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} They own an inventory of between 4,000 and 4,500 works, stored in the duty-free [[Geneva Freeport]] warehouse next to the airport in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The brothers buy and sell most of their works at auction.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Personal life==
His son [[Helly Nahmad (London)|Helly Nahmad]] is a London-based art dealer. In 2007, his daughter Michaela Nahmad was "thought to be embarking on a career as an art dealer".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/artsales/3670009/Market-news-graffiti-art.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8697">[[Image:Wheel2.gif|thumb|The Fragrance Wheel, ver. 1983]]
A '''fragrance wheel''', variously called an '''aroma wheel''', a '''fragrance circle''', a '''perfume wheel''' or a '''smell wheel''', is a round diagram showing the inferred relationships among olfactory groups based upon similarities and differences in their odor. The groups bordering one another are implied to share common olfactory characteristics. Fragrance wheels are frequently used as a classification tool in [[oenology]] and [[perfumery]].

The first example of a fragrance wheel was conceived by Austrian perfumer [[Paul Jellinek]] and titled the ''Odor Effects Diagram'', published in the original German edition of his book ''The Practice of Modern Perfumery'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Jellinek, P. (1949) Praktikum des Modernen Parfümeurs, Vienna&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable versions include the ''Fragrance Circle'', developed in 1979 by U. Harder at Haarman &amp; Reimer, the ''Wine Aroma Wheel'', from 1984 by sensory chemist [[Ann C. Noble]], and the ''Fragrance Wheel'', created in 1992 by perfumery taxonomist [[Michael Edwards (fragrance expert)|Michael Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;Harder, U. (1979). Der H&amp;R duftkreis. 
Haarmann &amp; Reimer, Contact, 23, 18-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noble, A.C., Arnold, R.A., Masuda, S.D., Pecore, J.O. Schmidt, and P.M. Stern, “Progress towards a standardized system of wine aroma terminology.” American Journal of Enology and Viticulture, 35 (1984), pp. 107-109
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Michael. Fragrances of the World. Sydney, N.S.W.: Fragrances of the World, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fragrance Chart==
{{generalize|date=April 2017}}
Since its creation, Michael Edwards' ''Fragrance Wheel'' and the developed fragrance classification scheme has been modified several times through the addition of different groups to encompass different fragrance types.&lt;ref name=MDB&gt;{{citation |title=Sniffapalooza Magazine Exclusive interview with Michael Edwards Fragrance Expert and Author of "Fragrances Of The World" |first=Mark David |last=Boberick |date=2010-03-30 |journal=Sniffapalooza Magazine |url=http://www.sniffapaloozamagazine.com/MICHAEL-EDWARDS-INTERVIEW-SNIFFAPALOOZA-MAGAZINE.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four standard families are '''Floral''', '''Oriental''', '''Woody''' and '''Fresh'''. These are in turn divided into three sub-groups (e.g. in the Floral Family: Floral, Soft Floral, Floral Oriental) and arranged in a circle, each group being related to the next. Each of the subclasses were in turn divided into ''Fresh'', ''Crisp'', ''Classical'', and ''Rich'' compositions. Prior to 2010 ''[[Fougère]]'' family was placed at the center of this wheel since they are a large family of scents that usually contain fragrance elements from each of the other four families; citrus from the ''fresh'' family, oak moss and woods from the ''woody'' family, coumarin and incense from the ''Oriental'' family, and lavender from the ''floral'' family.&lt;ref name=ME&gt;{{citation |title=Fragrances of the world 2008 |year=2008 |first=Michael |last=Edwards |publisher=Michael Edwards &amp; Co |isbn=978-0-9756097-3-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this classification scheme, ''Chanel No.5'', which is traditionally classified as a "Floral Aldehyde" would be located under ''Soft Floral'' sub-group, and "Amber" scents would be placed within the ''Oriental'' group. As a class, [[Chypre]]s are more difficult to place since they would be located under parts of the ''Oriental'' and ''Woody'' families. For instance, ''Guerlain Mitsouko'', which is classically identified as a chypre will be placed under ''Mossy Woods'', but ''Hermès Rouge'', a chypre with more floral character, would be placed under ''Floral Oriental''.
Originally they are:

|''Citrus''

|''Green''
|-
|''Water''
|}

With the publication of Fragrances of the World 2008, two new sub-groups: ''Fruity'' and ''Woods'', have been added to the wheel.&lt;ref name=MDB/&gt;

The chart was again modified in 2010, moving the Aromatics/Fougere group to between ''Citrus'' and ''Dry Woods'' to synchronize the chart with recent studies on smell perception.&lt;ref name=MZ&gt;{{citation |title=Understanding the underlying dimensions in perfumers' odor perception space as a basis for developing meaningful odor maps |first=Manuel |last=Zarzo |first2=David T. |last2=Stanton |journal=Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics |year=2009 |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=225–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Laura |last=Donna |title=Fragrance Perception: Is Everything Relative? |journal=Perfumer and Flavourist |volume=34 |date=December 2009  |pages=26–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Hasht-Bihisht'''" ({{lang-fa|هشت بهشت}}, lit. "The Eight Paradises") is a famous poem written by [[Amir Khusrow]] around 1302 AD.  The poem is based on the ''[[Haft Paykar]]'' by [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], written around 1197 AD, which in turn takes its outline from the earlier epic [[Shahnameh]] written by [[Firdausi]] around 1010 AD. Like Nizami's ''Haft Paykar'', Khusro's ''Hasht Bihisht'' uses a legend about [[Bahram V]] Gur as its [[frame story]] and, in the style of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', introduces folktales told by seven princesses.  Most famously, Khusro appears to be the first writer to have added [[The Three Princes of Serendip]] as characters and the story of the alleged camel theft and recovery.

The eight "paradises" in the poem link closely with [[Jannah|the Islamic conception of Heaven]] with its eight gates and eight spaces, each one decorated with a special precious stone or material.&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hast-behest-2 |title=Encyclopaedia Iranica entry on Hast Behest |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven of the eight paradises are pavilions constructed for Bahram's "therapy" of storytelling. There is also a link to the [[Hasht-Bihisht (Architecture)|architectural]] and garden plan of eight paradises.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

==The narrative==
The narrative commences with the story of Bahram and Dilaram.

Later, Bahram has seven differently-coloured domed pavilions built for him within his palace grounds, in which wait seven princesses from various parts of the world. Bahram Gur visits each on a different day of the week and each of them tells him a story:

* Wednesday – the Violet Pavilion – the Princess of [[Byzantine Empire|Rum]]
* Thursday – the Brown Pavilion – the Arabian Princess
* Friday – the White Pavilion – the Princess of [[Khwarezm]]

==Manuscripts==
The ''Hasht-Bihisht'', and indeed the whole of the ''Khamsah'', was a popular work in the centuries after Khusro's death, not only in India, but in Iran and the Ottoman Empire, and as such was illustrated nearly as frequently as Nizami's ''Khamsah'' from the early fifteenth century on.&lt;ref name=gabbay&gt;{{cite book|last=Gabbay|first=Alyssa|title=Islamic tolerance : Amir Khusraw and pluralism|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-77913-5|page=43|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
* The ''Hasht-Bihisht'' has never been translated entirely into any language except Italian. Verse translations of two stories (Tuesday and Friday) by Sunil Sharma have been published. 
* Lal and Prasada provide a partial direct-to-English translation and commentary of Saturday's tale which introduces [[The Three Princes of Serendip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lal|first1=Oudh Behari|last2=Prasada|first2=Jwala|title=Complete Key to the Persian Entrance Course for 1897-1898 (for the University of Allahabad)|date=1896|publisher=Ram Chandra|location=Allahabad, India|language=English, Arabic, Urdu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walters Art Museum Manuscript W.624===
The poem was illustrated in a manuscript probably produced in [[Lahore]] in the late sixteenth CE which is associated with the patronage of [[Akbar]] (r. 1556-1605 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/medmss/sets/72157623891285410/with/4535282855/ |title=The Walters Art Museum set for the manuscript on |publisher=Flickr.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedigitalwalters.org/Data/WaltersManuscripts/html/W624/description.html |title=Description page at |publisher=Thedigitalwalters.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript was written in nasta'liq script by one of the greatest calligraphers of the [[Mughal miniature painting|Mughal atelier]], Muhammad Husayn al-Kashmiri, honoured with the epithet Zarrin Qalam (golden pen).  The manuscript has the names of a number of  painters: Lal, Manuhar, Sanwalah, Farrukh, Aliquli, Dharamdas, Narsing, Jagannath, Miskina, Mukund, and Surdas Gujarati. The illuminators are Husayn Naqqash, Mansur Naqqash, Khvajah Jan Shirazi, and Lutf Allah Muzahhib

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4103">'''Leontophone''' (Leontophonos, Leophontes) is a small animal from [[Bestiary|Medieval bestiaries]] that is deadly to lions. To kill a [[lion]], the lion need only bite the leontophone. Though, in a proper ritual, the leontophone's [[flesh]] is burned and its ashes are sprinkled on a piece of meat, which is placed at a [[Intersection (road)|crossroad]]; if a lion eats even a small amount of the tainted meat, it dies. The ancients considered this method a 'happy arrangement', since both lions and leontophones die in the process; from this, one can safely assume that not only were lions considered [[Risk|dangerous]], but leontophones may have been considered [[pest (organism)|pests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LU6oFxvVoe8C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=leontophonos+happy+arrangement&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OxWWmPXD7n&amp;sig=SqB5fcV2zdh6Q8vwO4eGRw7WJF8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5eRlUNedA5Lm8wTrioHwBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=leontophonos%20happy%20arrangement&amp;f=false|title= Leontophone|accessdate=2012-09-28|work= Natural History, Lore and Legend by Frederick Edward Hulme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, due to the danger they pose to lions, [[lion]]s instinctively hate leontophones. Confronted by a leontophone, they often hunt and kill them, tearing them apart with their claws rather than biting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast4410.htm|title=Leontophone|accessdate=2008-12-28|work=[http://bestiary.ca/ The Medieval Bestiary]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some sources state that the lion will instead flee from the small creature, only attacking and killing it when left with no option to flee (since attacking the leontophone may cause it to urinate, and the urine of the leontophone is ''also'' fatally [[poison]]ous to lions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WNUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=leontophonos+lion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DA37e75gmp&amp;sig=iVAeB3WF0Y_QPk3BoR1Y1Y65I0U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jN1lUPLZMYGW8gSK9IDQBg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=leontophonos%20lionf=false|title= Leontophone|accessdate=2012-09-28|work=Animal and Man in Bible Lands, Volume 1 By Friedrich Simon Bodenheimer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though no sources give a definite depiction of the leontophone's appearance, some sources speculate that the creature looks like a small [[boar]] or a small [[bear]], while others speculate that it is serpentine (with some referring to it even as a small 'worm', the medieval term for a [[dragon]]).

[[File:ColorValue.svg|frame|right|Three [[hue]]s in the [[Munsell color system|Munsell color model]]. Each color differs in value from top to bottom in equal perception steps. The right column undergoes a dramatic change in perceived color.]]

In [[colorimetry]] and [[color theory]], '''lightness''', also known as '''value''' or '''tone''', is a representation of variation in the perception of a [[color]] or [[color space]]'s [[brightness]]. It is one of the [[Color appearance model#Color appearance parameters|color appearance parameters]] of any [[color appearance model]]. 

Various [[color models]] have an explicit term for this property. The [[Munsell color system|Munsell color model]] uses the term ''value'', while the [[HSL and HSV|HSL color model]], [[HCL color space]] and [[Lab color space]] use the term ''lightness''. The [[HSL and HSV|HSV model]] uses the term ''value'' a little differently: a color with a low value is nearly black, but one with a high value is the pure, fully saturated color.

In [[subtractive color]] (i.e. paints) value changes can be achieved by adding black or white to the color. However, this also reduces saturation. [[Chiaroscuro]] and [[Tenebrism]] both take advantage of dramatic contrasts of value to heighten drama in art. Artists may also employ [[shading]], subtle manipulation of value.

==Lightness and human perception==
{{double image|right|srgb-in-cielab.png|197|adobergb-in-cielab.png|197|Fig 2a. The [[sRGB]] gamut mapped in CIELAB space. Notice that the lines pointing to the red, green, and blue primaries are not evenly spaced by hue angle, and are of unequal length. The primaries also have different ''L''* values.|Fig 2b. The [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]] gamut mapped in CIELAB space. Also notice that these two RGB spaces have different gamuts, and thus will have different HSL and HSV representations.}}

While HSL, HSV, and related spaces serve well enough to, for instance, choose a single color, they ignore much of the complexity of color appearance. Essentially, they trade off perceptual relevance for computation speed, from a time in computing history (high-end 1970s graphics workstations, or mid-1990s consumer desktops) when more sophisticated models would have been too computationally expensive.{{refn|group=upper-alpha |Most of the disadvantages below are listed in [[#Poynton|Poynton (1997)]], though as mere statements, without examples.}}

[[HSL and HSV]] are simple transformations of the [[RGB color model]] which preserve symmetries in the RGB cube unrelated to human perception, such that its ''R'', ''G'', and ''B'' corners are equidistant from the neutral axis, and equally spaced around it. If we plot the RGB gamut in a more [[perceptually uniform]] space, such as [[CIELAB]], it becomes immediately clear that the red, green, and blue primaries do not have the same lightness or chroma, or evenly spaced hues. Furthermore, different RGB displays use different primaries, and so have different gamuts. Because HSL and HSV are defined purely with reference to some RGB space, they are not [[absolute color space]]s: to specify a color precisely requires reporting not only HSL or HSV values, but also the characteristics of the RGB space they are based on, including the [[gamma correction]] in use.

If we take an image and extract the hue, saturation, and lightness or value components, and then compare these to the components of the same name as defined by color scientists, we can quickly see the difference, perceptually. For example, examine the following images of a fire breather ({{nobr|fig. 1}}). The original is in the sRGB color space.  CIELAB ''L''* is a CIE-defined achromatic lightness quantity (dependent solely on the perceptually achromatic luminance ''Y'', but not the mixed-chromatic components ''X'' or ''Z'', of the [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE XYZ color space]] from which the sRGB color space itself is derived), and it is plain that this appears similar in perceptual lightness to the original color image. Luma is roughly similar, but differs somewhat at high chroma, where it deviates most from depending solely on the true achromatic luminance (''Y'', or equivalently ''L''*) and is influenced by the colorimetric chromaticity (''x,y'', or equivalently, ''a*,b*'' of CIELAB).  HSL ''L'' and HSV ''V'', by contrast, diverge substantially from perceptual lightness.

==Relationship to value and relative luminance==
The [[Munsell_color_system|Munsell value]] has long been used as a [[Color difference#Tolerance|perceptually uniform]] lightness scale. A question of interest is the relationship between the Munsell value scale and the [[relative luminance]]. Aware of the [[Weber–Fechner law]], Munsell remarked "Should we use a logarithmic curve or curve of squares?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The early development of the Munsell system|first=Rolf G.|last=Kuehni|volume=27|issue=1|pages=20–27|doi=10.1002/col.10002|date=February 2002|journal=Color Research &amp; Application}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither option turned out to be quite correct; scientists eventually converged on a roughly cube-root curve, consistent with the [[Stevens' power law]] for brightness perception, reflecting the fact that lightness is proportional to the number of nerve impulses per nerve fiber per unit time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Light Energy and Brightness Sensation|first=Robert W. G.|last=Hunt|date=May 18, 1957|page=1026|volume=179|issue=4568| journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/1791026a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of this section is a chronology of lightness approximations, leading to [[CIE LAB]].

''Note.'' – Munsell's ''V'' runs from 0 to 10, while ''Y'' typically runs from 0 to 100 (often interpreted as a percentage). Typically, the relative luminance is normalized so that the "reference white" (say, [[magnesium oxide]]) has a tristimulus value of {{nowrap|1=''Y'' = 100}}. Since the reflectance of magnesium oxide (MgO) relative to the [[diffuser (optics)#Perfect reflecting diffuser|perfect reflecting diffuser]] is 97.5%, {{nowrap|1=''V'' = 10}} corresponds to {{nowrap|1=''Y'' = 100/97.5% ≈ 102.6}} if MgO is used as the reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNDS1C6x0WYC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=0.975+OR+97.5+%22magnesium+oxide%22|title=Light Vision Color|first=Arne|last=Valberg|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2006|isbn=0470849029|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lightness approximations.svg|thumb|right|500px|Observe that the lightness is 50% for a relative luminance of around 18% relative to the reference white.]]

; 1920: Priest ''et al.'' provide a basic estimate of the Munsell value (with ''Y'' running from 0 to 1 in this case):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Irwin G.|last=Priest|last2=Gibson|first2=K.S.|last3=McNicholas|first3=H.J.|title=An examination of the Munsell color system.

:: &lt;math&gt;V = 10 \sqrt{Y}.&lt;/math&gt;

; 1933: Munsell, Sloan, and Godlove launch a study on the Munsell neutral value scale, considering several proposals relating the relative luminance to the Munsell value, and suggest:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.E.O.|last=Munsell|author2=Sloan, L.L. |author3=Godlove, I.H. |title=Neutral value scales.

; 1943: Newhall, Nickerson, and Judd prepare a report for the [[Optical Society of America]].

; 1943: Using Table II of the O.S.A. report, Moon and Spencer express the value in terms of the relative luminance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[JOSA]]|title=Metric based on the composite color stimulus|first=Parry|last=Moon|author2=Spencer, Domina Eberle |volume=33|issue=5|date=May 1943|pages=270–277|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-33-5-270|doi=10.1364/JOSA.33.000270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;V = 2.357 Y^{0.343} - 1.52.&lt;/math&gt;

; 1955: Ladd and Pinney of [[Eastman Kodak]] are interested in the Munsell value as a perceptually uniform lightness scale for use in [[television]]. After considering one logarithmic and five [[power-law]] functions (per [[Stevens' power law]]), they relate value to reflectance by raising the reflectance to the power of 0.352:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Empirical relationships with the Munsell Value scale|last=Ladd|first=J.H.|author2=Pinney, J.E. |journal=Proceedings of the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]]|volume=43|issue=9|page=1137|date=September 1955|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1955.277892| url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?isnumber=4055542&amp;arnumber=4055558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;V = 2.217 Y^{0.352} - 1.324.&lt;/math&gt;

: This formula approximates the Munsell value function for {{nowrap|1% &lt; ''Y'' &lt; 98%}} (it is not applicable for {{nowrap|''Y'' &lt; 1%}}) and is used for the [[CIE 1964 color space]].

; 1976: [[CIE LAB]] uses the following formula:
:: &lt;math&gt;L^\star = 116(Y/Y_\mathrm{n})^{1/3} - 16.&lt;/math&gt;
: where ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[CIE XYZ]] ''Y'' tristimulus value of the reference [[white point]] (the subscript n suggests "normalized") and is subject to the restriction {{nowrap|''Y''/''Y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0.01}}. Pauli removes this restriction by computing a [[linear extrapolation]] which maps {{nowrap|1=''Y''/''Y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} to {{nowrap|1=''L''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 0}} and is tangent to the formula above at the point at which the linear extension takes effect. First, the transition point is determined to be {{nowrap|1=''Y''/''Y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = (6/29)^3 ≈ 0.008,856}}, then the slope of {{nowrap|(29/3)^3 ≈ 903.3}} is computed. This gives the two-part function:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Hartmut K.A.|last=Pauli|title=Proposed extension of the CIE recommendation on "Uniform color spaces, color spaces, and color-difference equations, and metric color terms"|journal=[[JOSA]]|volume=66|issue=8|pages=866–867|year=1976| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-66-8-866|doi=10.1364/JOSA.66.000866}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;f(t) = \begin{cases}
    t^{1/3} &amp; \text{if } t &gt; \big(\frac{6}{29}\big)^3 \\
    \frac{1}{3}\big(\frac{29}{6}\big)^2 t + \frac{4}{29} &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
: The lightness is then:
:: &lt;math&gt;L^\star = 116 f(Y/Y_\mathrm{n}) - 16.&lt;/math&gt;

At first glance, you might approximate the lightness function by a cube root, an approximation that is found in much of the technical literature. However, the linear segment near black is significant, and so the 116 and 16 coefficients. The best-fit pure power function has an exponent of about 0.42, far from 1/3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Charles|last=Poynton|first2=Brian|last2=Funt|title=Perceptual uniformity in digital image representation and display|journal=Color Research and Application|volume=39|issue=1|pages=6–15|date=Feb 2014|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/col.21768|doi=10.1002/col.21768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An approximately 18% grey card, having an exact reflectance of &lt;math&gt;\left(33/58\right)^3&lt;/math&gt;, has a lightness value of 50. It is called "mid grey" because its lightness is midway between black and white.

==Other psychological effects==
This subjective perception of luminance in a non-linear fashion is one thing that makes [[Gamma correction|gamma compression]] of images worthwhile. Beside this phenomenon there are other effects involving perception of lightness. Chromacity can affect perceived lightness as described by the [[Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect]]. Though the CIE LAB space and relatives do not account for this effect on lightness, it may be implied in the Munsell color model. 
Light levels may also affect perceived chromacity, as with the [[Purkinje effect]].

'''Medieval architecture''' is  [[architecture]] common in [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]].

==Types==
[[File:Normandie Manche Mont1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|Cloisters of [[Mont Saint-Michel]], Normandy, France.]]

===Religious architecture===
The [[Latin cross]] plan, common in medieval ecclesiastical architecture, takes the Roman [[basilica]] as its primary model with subsequent developments. It consists of a [[nave]], [[transept]]s, and the [[altar]] stands at the east end (see ''[[Cathedral diagram]]''). Also, [[cathedral]]s influenced or commissioned by [[Justinian I|Justinian]] employed the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine style]] of domes and a [[Greek cross]] (resembling a plus sign), with the altar located in the sanctuary on the east side of the church.
{{further information|Cistercian architecture}}

===Military architecture===
[[File:Zolyomcivertanlegi1.jpg|thumb|[[Zvolen Castle]] in [[Slovakia]] strongly inspired by Italian castles of the fourteenth century]]
{{main article|castle|tower house}}
Surviving examples of medieval secular architecture mainly served for defense. [[Castle]]s and [[fortified wall]]s provide the most notable remaining non-religious examples of medieval architecture. Windows gained a cross-shape for more than decorative purposes, they provided a perfect fit for a [[crossbow]]man to safely shoot at invaders from inside. Crenellated walls ([[battlement]]s) provided shelters for archers on the roofs to hide behind when not shooting invaders.

===Civic architecture===
While much of the surviving medieval architecture is either religious or military, examples of civic and even domestic architecture can be found throughout Europe. Examples include [[manor house]]s, [[town hall]]s, [[almshouse]]s and bridges, but also residential houses.

==Styles==

===Pre-Romanesque===

European architecture in the [[Early Middle Ages]] may be divided into [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]], [[Romanesque architecture]], [[Russian church architecture]], [[Medieval Scandinavian architecture|Norse Architecture]], [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]], including [[Merovingian art and architecture|Merovingian]], [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]], [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian]], and [[Asturian art and architecture|Asturian]]. While these terms are problematic,{{Why|date=October 2018}} they nonetheless serve adequately as entries into the era.  Considerations that enter into histories of each period include [[Trachtenberg]]'s "historicising" and "modernising" elements, Italian versus northern, Spanish, and Byzantine elements, and especially the religious and political maneuverings between kings, popes, and various ecclesiastic officials.

===Romanesque===
{{main article|Romanesque architecture}}
&lt;!--good image, but hard to comprehend without zooming in on [[Image:Media STT 20090928 212211 med.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Photo-textured laser scan image of the Cloister of St. Trophime. The north and east galleries are barrel-vaulted [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], while the south and west galleries are early [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] with pointed transverse arches.]]--&gt;

Romanesque, prevalent in medieval Europe during the 11th and 12th centuries, was the first pan-European style since [[Roman Architecture|Roman Imperial Architecture]] and examples are found in every part of the continent. The term was not contemporary with the art it describes, but rather, is an invention of modern scholarship based on its similarity to Roman Architecture in forms and materials. Romanesque is characterized by a use of round or slightly pointed arches, barrel vaults, and cruciform piers supporting vaults. Romansque buildings are widely known throughout Europe.

===Gothic===
{{Main article|Gothic architecture}}
The various elements of Gothic architecture emerged in a number of 11th and 12th century building projects, particularly in the [[Île de France]] area, but were first combined to form what we would now recognise as a distinctively Gothic style at the [[Saint Denis Basilica|12th century abbey church of Saint-Denis]] in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], near [[Paris]].  Verticality is emphasized in Gothic architecture, which features almost skeletal stone structures with great expanses of glass, pared-down wall surfaces supported by external [[flying buttress]]es, pointed [[arch]]es using the [[ogive]] shape, ribbed stone vaults, clustered columns, pinnacles and sharply pointed spires. Windows contain [[stained glass]], showing stories from the [[Bible]] and from lives of [[saint]]s. Such advances in design allowed cathedrals to rise taller than ever, and it became something of an inter-regional contest to build a church as high as possible. Variations included these [[Brick Gothic]]

The '''medieval art''' of the [[Western world]] covers a vast scope of time and place, over 1000 years of art in [[Western art history|Europe]], and at times the Middle East and North Africa. It includes major art movements and periods, national and regional art, genres, revivals, the artists' crafts, and the artists themselves.

Art historians attempt to classify medieval art into major periods and styles, often with some difficulty.  A generally accepted scheme includes the later phases of [[Early Christian art]], [[Migration Period art]], [[Byzantine art]], [[Insular art]], [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]], [[Romanesque art]], and [[Gothic art]], as well as many other periods within these central styles. In addition each region, mostly during the period in the process of becoming  [[nation]]s or cultures, had its own distinct artistic style, such as [[Anglo-Saxon art]] or [[Norse art]].

Medieval art was produced in many media, and works survive in large numbers in [[sculpture]], [[illuminated manuscript]]s, [[stained glass]], [[metalwork]] and [[mosaic]]s, all of which have had a higher survival rate than other media such as [[fresco]] wall-paintings, work in precious metals or [[History of clothing and textiles#Medieval clothing and textiles|textile]]s, including [[tapestry]].  Especially in the early part of the period, works in the so-called "minor arts" or [[decorative arts]], such as metalwork, ivory carving, [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[embroidery]] using precious metals, were probably more highly valued than paintings or [[monumental sculpture]].&lt;ref&gt;Heslop traces the beginning of the change to "around the twelfth century", quoted, 54; Zarnecki, 234&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval art in Europe grew out of the artistic heritage of the [[Roman art|Roman Empire]] and the [[Christian iconography|iconographic traditions]] of the [[early Christian church]]. These sources were mixed with the vigorous "barbarian" artistic culture of Northern Europe to produce a remarkable artistic legacy. Indeed, the history of medieval art can be seen as the history of the interplay between the elements of [[classical art|classical]], early Christian and "barbarian" art.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger (throughout), Hinks (especially Part 1) and Henderson (Chapters 1, 2 &amp; 4) in particular are concerned with this perennial theme. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDNobJFWygcC&amp;pg=PA407&amp;lpg=PA407&amp;dq=Medieval+art+classical+barbarian+Gardner's&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AUZrn-wyQw&amp;sig=y2nS9GdW5mslQ8b5r7aRRr4119s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=m5KBStT8HIy5jAfaocSKCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the formal aspects of classicism, there was a continuous tradition of realistic depiction of objects that survived in Byzantine art throughout the period, while in the West it appears intermittently, combining and sometimes competing with new expressionist possibilities developed in Western Europe and the Northern legacy of energetic decorative elements.  The period ended with the self-perceived [[Renaissance]] recovery of the skills and values of classical art, and the artistic legacy of the [[Middle Ages]] was then [[Dark Ages (historiography)|disparaged]] for some centuries.  Since a revival of interest and understanding in the 19th century it has been seen as a period of enormous achievement that underlies the development of later Western art.

==Overview==

[[File:Lorenzetti amb.effect2.jpg|thumb|400px|Detail of ''The Effects of Good Government'', a [[fresco]] in the [[Palazzo Pubblico|City Hall of Siena]] by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]], 1338.]]

The [[Middle Ages]] in Europe saw a decrease in prosperity, stability, and population in the first centuries of the period—to about 800 AD, and then a fairly steady and general increase until the massive setback of the [[Black Death]] around 1350, which is estimated to have killed at least a third of the overall population in Europe, with generally higher rates in the south and lower in the north.  Many regions did not regain their former population levels until the 17th century.  The [[Medieval demographics|population of Europe]] is estimated to have reached a low point of about 18 million in 650, to have doubled around the year 1000, and to have reached over 70 million by 1340, just before the Black Death. In 1450 it was still only 50 million. To these figures, Northern Europe, especially Britain, contributed a lower proportion than today, and Southern Europe, including France, a higher one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html Fordham University] Josiah Russell's figures - all estimates are of course very imprecise.  See [[Consequences of the Black Death]] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;  The increase in prosperity, for those who survived, was much less affected by the Black Death. Until about the 11th century most of Europe was short of agricultural labour, with large amounts of unused land, and the [[Medieval Warm Period]] benefited agriculture until about 1315.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 2002AGUFMPP71C..09L | title=Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Periods in Eastern China as Read from the Speleothem Records | journal=AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts | year=2002 | authors=Li, H.; Ku, T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Courtly scenes Louvre MRR197.jpg|thumb|left|Scenes of [[courtly love]] on a lady's [[ivory]] mirror-case. Paris, 1300–1330.]]
The medieval period eventually saw the falling away of the invasions and incursions from outside the area that characterized the first millennium.  The [[Islamic conquests]] of the 6th and 7th century suddenly and permanently removed all of North Africa from the Western world, and over the rest of the period Islamic peoples gradually took over the [[Byzantine Empire]], until the end of the Middle Ages when Catholic Europe, having regained the Iberian peninsula in the southwest, was once again under Muslim threat from the southeast.

At the start of the medieval period most significant works of art were very rare and costly objects associated with secular elites, monasteries or major churches and, if religious, largely produced by monks.  By the end of the Middle Ages works of considerable artistic interest could be found in small villages and significant numbers of [[bourgeois]] homes in towns, and their production was in many places an important local industry, with artists from the [[clergy]] now the exception.  However the [[Rule of St Benedict]] permitted the sale of works of art by monasteries, and it is clear that throughout the period monks might produce art, including secular works, commercially for a lay market, and monasteries would equally hire lay specialists where necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23, and Chapter III&lt;/ref&gt;

The impression may be left by the surviving works that almost all medieval art was religious.  This is far from the case; though the church became very wealthy over the Middle Ages and was prepared at times to spend lavishly on art, there was also much secular art of equivalent quality which has suffered from a far higher rate of wear and tear, loss and destruction.  The Middle Ages generally lacked the concept of preserving older works for their artistic merit, as opposed to their association with a saint or founder figure, and the following periods of the Renaissance and [[Baroque]] tended to disparage medieval art.  Most luxury illuminated manuscripts of the Early Middle Ages had lavish [[treasure binding]] book-covers in precious metal, ivory and jewels; the re-bound pages and ivory [[relief]]s for the covers have survived in far greater numbers than complete covers, which have mostly been stripped off for their valuable materials at some point.
[[File:Codex Aureus Sankt Emmeram.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Treasure binding|jewelled cover]] of the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], c. 870, a Carolingian [[Gospel book]].]]

Most churches have been rebuilt, often several times, but medieval palaces and large houses have been lost at a far greater rate, which is also true of their fittings and decoration. In England, churches survive largely intact from every century since the 7th, and in considerable numbers for the later ones—the city of [[Norwich]] alone has 40 medieval churches—but of the dozens of royal palaces none survive from earlier than the 11th century, and only a handful of remnants from the rest of the period.&lt;ref&gt;The [[White Tower (Tower of London)]] was started in 1078, and some later royal apartments in the [[Tower of London]] survive, as do the hall and parts of [[Eltham Palace]], the most significant medieval remains from an unfortified royal palace. Royal apartments survive in some castles.&lt;/ref&gt;  The situation is similar in most of Europe, though the 14th century [[Palais des Papes]] in [[Avignon]] survives largely intact.  Many of the longest running scholarly disputes over the date and origin of individual works relate to secular pieces, because they are so much rarer - the Anglo-Saxon [[Fuller Brooch]] was refused by the [[British Museum]] as an implausible fake, and small free-standing secular bronze sculptures are so rare that the date, origin and even authenticity of both of the two best examples has been argued over for decades.&lt;ref&gt;the small Carolingian(?) ''Equestrian Statue of an Emperor'' in the [[Carnavalet Museum]] in Paris, Hinks, 125-7; and the 12th(?)-century bronze of a man wrestling with a lion, variously considered English, German or [[Sicily|Sicilian]] in origin, discussed by Henderson (1977), 135–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of valuable materials is a constant in medieval art; until the end of the period, far more was typically spent on buying them than on paying the artists, even if these were not monks performing their duties.  [[Gold]] was used for objects for churches and palaces, personal jewellery and the fittings of clothes, and—fixed to the back of glass [[tesserae]]—as a solid background for [[mosaic]]s, or applied as [[gold leaf]] to miniatures in manuscripts and panel paintings.  Many objects using precious metals were made in the knowledge that their bullion value might be realized at a future point—only near the end of the period could money be invested other than in [[real estate]], except at great risk or by committing [[usury]].
[[File:Wilton diptych.jpg|thumb|360px|The small private [[Wilton Diptych]] for [[Richard II of England]], c. 1400, with stamped gold backgrounds and much [[ultramarine]].]]

The even more expensive [[pigment]] [[ultramarine]], made from ground [[lapis lazuli]] obtainable only from [[Afghanistan]], was used lavishly in the Gothic period, more often for the traditional blue outer mantle of the [[Virgin Mary]] than for skies.  [[Ivory]], often painted, was an important material until the very end of the period, well illustrating the shift in luxury art to secular works; at the beginning of the period most uses were shifting from [[consular diptych]]s to religious objects such as book-covers, [[reliquaries]] and [[crozier]]s, but in the Gothic period secular mirror-cases, caskets and decorated combs become common among the well-off.  As thin ivory panels carved in [[relief]] could rarely be recycled for another work, the number of survivals is relatively high—the same is true of manuscript pages, although these were often re-cycled by scraping, whereupon they become [[palimpsest]]s.

Even these basic materials were costly: when the Anglo-Saxon [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey]] planned to create three copies of the bible in 692—of which one survives as the [[Codex Amiatinus]]—the first step necessary was to plan to breed the cattle to supply the 1,600 [[calf (animal)|calves]] to give the skin for the [[vellum]] required.&lt;ref&gt;Grocock, Chris has some calculations in [http://www.mayoalive.com/Mag1096/AbbyTalk.htm ''Mayo of the Saxons and Anglican Jarrow'', Evidence for a Monastic Economy], according to which sheep required only one third as much land per page as calves.  1,600 calves seems to be the standard estimate, see {{citation |last=John |first=Eric |title=Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England |year=1996 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |isbn=0-7190-5053-7 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7ju8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paper]] became available in the last centuries of the period, but was also extremely expensive by today's standards; [[woodcut]]s sold to ordinary pilgrims at shrines were often [[matchbook]] size or smaller.  Modern [[dendrochronology]] has revealed that most of the [[oak]] for panels used in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of the 15th century was felled in the [[Vistula]] basin in Poland, from where it was shipped down the river and across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea]]s to [[Flanders|Flemish]] ports, before being seasoned for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 29 – the following pages describe gold, pigments and other materials.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art in the Middle Ages is a broad subject and art historians traditionally divide it in several large-scale phases, styles or periods.  The period of the Middle Ages neither begins nor ends neatly at any particular date, nor at the same time in all regions, and the same is true for the major phases of art within the period.&lt;ref&gt;Dates are discussed in Calkins (1979), xix-xx, Kitzinger (1955), 1, Beckwith (1964), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The major phases are covered in the following sections.

==Early Christian and Late Antique art==
{{Main|Early Christian art}}
[[File:Arco di Costantino (Roma) - tondo lato settentrionale destro.jpg|thumb|[[Arch of Constantine]], Rome, completed 315: The lower long [[relief]], with squat figures of size varying with status, is of that date, while the [[roundels]] are taken from a monument of nearly 200 years earlier, which maintains a classical style.]]

Early Christian art, more generally described as [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] art, covers the period from about 200 (before which no distinct Christian art survives), until the onset of a fully [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]] in about 500.  There continue to be different views as to when the medieval period begins during this time, both in terms of general history and specifically art history, but it is most often placed late in the period.  In the course of the 4th century Christianity went from being a persecuted popular sect to the official religion of the Empire, adapting existing Roman styles and often [[iconography]], from both popular and Imperial art.  From the start of the period the main survivals of Christian art are the tomb-paintings in popular styles of the [[catacombs of Rome]], but by the end there were a number of lavish mosaics in churches built under Imperial patronage.

Over this period imperial Late [[Roman art]] went through a strikingly "baroque" phase, and then largely abandoned classical style and Greek realism in favour of a more mystical and hieratic style—a process that was well underway before Christianity became a major influence on imperial art.  Influences from Eastern parts of the Empire—[[Egypt]], [[Syria]] and beyond, and also a robust "Italic" vernacular tradition, contributed to this process. Figures are mostly seen frontally staring out at the viewer, where classical art tended to show a profile view - the change was eventually seen even on coins. The individuality of portraits, a great strength of Roman art, declines sharply, and the anatomy and drapery of figures is shown with much less realism. The models from which medieval Northern Europe in particular formed its idea of "Roman" style were nearly all portable Late Antique works, and the Late Antique carved [[sarcophagi]] found all over the former Roman Empire;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson (1977), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; the determination to find earlier "purer" classical models, was a key element in the art ''all'antica'' of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Hinks, chapters 1 &amp; 2, and Kitzinger, 1955, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Byzantine art is the art of the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire formed after the division of the Roman Empire between Eastern and Western halves, and sometimes of parts of Italy under Byzantine rule.  It emerges from Late Antiquity in about 500 CE and soon formed a tradition distinct from that of Catholic Europe but with great influence over it.  In the early medieval period the best Byzantine art, often from the large Imperial workshops, represented an ideal of sophistication and technique which European patrons tried to emulate.  During the period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] in 730-843 the vast majority of [[icon]]s (sacred images usually painted on wood) were destroyed; so little remains that today any discovery sheds new understanding, and most remaining works are in Italy (Rome and [[Ravenna]] etc.), or Egypt at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]].

Byzantine art was extremely conservative, for religious and cultural reasons, but retained a continuous tradition of Greek realism, which contended with a strong anti-realist and hieratic impulse.   After the resumption of icon production in 843 until 1453 the Byzantine art tradition continued with relatively few changes, despite, or because of, the slow decline of the Empire.  There was a notable [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|revival of classical style]] in works of 10th century court art like the [[Paris Psalter]], and throughout the period manuscript illumination shows parallel styles, often used by the same artist, for iconic figures in framed miniatures and more informal small scenes or figures added unframed in the margins of the text in a much more realist style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|pp=57–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monumental sculpture]] with figures remained a taboo in Byzantine art; hardly any exceptions are known.  But small ivory reliefs, almost all in the iconic mode (the [[Harbaville Triptych]] is of similar date to the Paris Psalter, but very different in style), were a speciality, as was relief decoration on bowls and other metal objects.

The Byzantine Empire produced much of the finest art of the Middle Ages in terms of quality of material and workmanship, with court production centred on [[Constantinople]], although some art historians have questioned the assumption, still commonly made, that all work of the best quality with no indication as to origin was produced in the capital. Byzantine art's crowning achievement were the monumental [[fresco]]s and [[mosaic]]s inside domed churches, most of which have not survived due to natural disasters and the appropriation of churches to [[mosques]].
[[File:L'abbé Ména et le Christ 01.JPG|thumb|6th or 7th century [[Coptic art|Coptic]] [[Icon of Christ and Abbot Mena|icon of Jesus and an abbot]] shares in more homely form the anti-realist style of Byzantine iconic art.]]

Byzantine art exercised a continuous trickle of influence on Western European art, and the splendours of the Byzantine court and monasteries, even at the end of the Empire, provided a model for Western rulers and secular and clerical patrons.  For example, [[Byzantine silk]] textiles, often woven or embroidered with designs of both animal and human figures, the former often reflecting traditions originating much further east, were unexcelled in the Christian world until almost the end of the Empire.  These were produced, but probably not entirely so, in Imperial workshops in Constantinople, about whose operations we know next to nothing—similar workshops are often conjectured for other arts, with even less evidence.  Some other decorative arts were less developed; Byzantine [[ceramic art|ceramics]] rarely rise above the level of attractive [[folk art]], despite the [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek heritage]] and the impressive future in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period of [[İznik pottery|İznik wares]] and other types of pottery.

The [[Coptic art]] of Egypt took a different path; after the [[Coptic Church]] separated in the mid-5th century it was never again supported by the state, and native Egyptian influences dominated to produce a completely non-realist and somewhat naive style of large-eyed figures floating in blank space.  This was capable of great expressiveness, and took the "Eastern" component of Byzantine art to its logical conclusions.  Coptic decoration used intricate geometric designs, often anticipating Islamic art.  Because of the exceptionally good preservation of Egyptian burials, we know more about the textiles used by the less well-off in Egypt than anywhere else.  These were often elaborately decorated with figurative and patterned designs.  Other local traditions in [[Armenia]], [[Syria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and elsewhere showed generally less sophistication, but often more vigour than the art of [[Constantinople]], and sometimes, especially in [[architecture]], seem to have had influence even in Western Europe.  For example, figurative monumental sculpture on the outside of churches appears here some centuries before it is seen in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Atroshenko and Judith Collins cover the Eastern influences on Romanesque art in detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration Period through Christianization==
{{Main|Migration Period art}}
[[File:Sutton.Hoo.ShoulderClasp2.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|left|Shoulder-clasp from [[Sutton Hoo]], Anglo-Saxon, c. 620. Interlaced biting snakes and confronted [[boar]]s (end sections) are depicted entirely schematically.]]

Migration Period art describes the art of the "[[barbarian]]" Germanic and Eastern-European peoples who were on the move, and then settling within the former Roman Empire, during the [[Völkerwanderung|Migration Period]] from about 300-700; the blanket term covers a wide range of ethnic or regional styles including early [[Anglo-Saxon art]], [[Visigothic art]], [[Norse art]], and [[Merovingian art]], all of which made use of the [[animal style]] as well as geometric motifs derived from classical art.  By this period the animal style had reached a much more abstracted form than in earlier [[Scythian art]] or [[La Tène style]].  Most artworks were small and portable and those surviving are mostly jewellery and metalwork, with the art expressed in geometric or schematic designs, often beautifully conceived and made, with few human figures and no attempt at realism.  The early Anglo-Saxon [[grave good]]s from [[Sutton Hoo]] are among the best examples.

As the "barbarian" peoples were [[Christianization|Christianized]], these influences interacted with the post-classical Mediterranean Christian artistic tradition, and new forms like the [[illuminated manuscript]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henderson|1977|loc=ch. 2}}; {{Harvnb|Calkins|1979|loc=chs 8 &amp; 9}}; {{Harvnb|Wilson|1984|pp=16–27}} on early Anglo-Saxon art.&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed [[coin]]s, which attempted to emulate [[Roman provincial coins]] and [[Byzantine coinage|Byzantine]] types.  Early coinage like the [[sceat]] shows designers completely unused to depicting a head in profile grappling with the problem in a variety of different ways.

As for larger works, there are references to Anglo-Saxon wooden pagan statues, all now lost, and in Norse art the tradition of carved [[runestone]]s was maintained after their conversion to Christianity. The Celtic [[Picts]] of Scotland also [[Pictish stones|carved stones]] before and after conversion, and the distinctive Anglo-Saxon and Irish tradition of [[High cross|large outdoor carved crosses]] may reflect earlier pagan works.  [[Viking art]] from later centuries in [[Scandinavia]] and parts of the British Isles includes work from both pagan and Christian backgrounds, and was one of the last flowerings of this broad group of styles.

==Insular art==
{{Main|Insular art}}
[[File:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|[[Book of Lindisfarne]], [[Northumbria]], c. 715; decoration invades the text of the beginning of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]:"Liber generationis Jesu Christi filii David, filii Abraham".]]

Insular art refers to the distinct style found in Ireland and Britain from about the 7th century, to about the 10th century, lasting later in Ireland, and parts of Scotland.  The style saw a fusion between the traditions of [[Celtic art]], the Germanic [[Migration period art]] of the [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxons]] and the Christian forms of the book, [[high cross]]es and liturgical metalwork.

Extremely detailed geometric, [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]], and stylised animal decoration, with forms derived from secular metalwork like [[brooch]]es, spread boldly across manuscripts, usually [[gospel book]]s like the [[Book of Kells]], with whole [[carpet page]]s devoted to such designs, and the development of the large decorated and [[historiated initial]].  There were very few human figures—most often these were [[Evangelist portrait]]s—and these were crude, even when closely following Late Antique models.

The insular manuscript style was transmitted to the continent by the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]], and its anti-classical energy was extremely important in the formation of later medieval styles.  In most Late Antique manuscripts text and decoration were kept clearly apart, though some initials began to be enlarged and elaborated, but major insular manuscripts sometimes take a whole page for a single initial or the first few words (see illustration) at beginnings of gospels or other sections in a book.  Allowing decoration a "right to roam" was to be very influential on Romanesque and Gothic art in all media.

The buildings of the monasteries for which the insular gospel books were made were then small and could fairly be called primitive, especially in Ireland.  There increasingly were other decorations to churches, where possible in precious metals, and a handful of these survive, like the [[Ardagh Chalice]], together with a larger number of extremely ornate and finely made pieces of secular high-status jewellery, the [[Celtic brooch]]es probably worn mainly by men, of which the [[Tara Brooch]] is the most spectacular.

"Franco-Saxon" is a term for a school of late Carolingian illumination in north-eastern France that used insular-style decoration, including super-large initials, sometimes in combination with figurative images typical of contemporary French styles. The "most tenacious of all the Carolingian styles", it continued until as late as the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodwell|1993|pp=74(quote)–75}}, and see index.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The influence of Islamic art==

{{main|Islamic influences on Western art}}
[[Islamic art]] during the Middle Ages falls outside the scope of this article, but it was widely imported and admired by European elites, and its influence needs mention.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, 324; Mack, Chapter 1, and passim throughout; [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sumay/hd_sumay.htm The Art of the Umayyad Period in Spain (711–1031), Metropolitan Museum of Art timeline] Retrieved April 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic art covers a wide variety of media including calligraphy, illustrated manuscripts, textiles, ceramics, metalwork and glass, and refers to the art of Muslim countries in the Near East, Islamic Spain, and Northern Africa, though by no means always Muslim artists or craftsmen.  [[Islamic glass|Glass production]], for example, remained a [[Jewish]] speciality throughout the period, and Christian art, as in [[Coptic art|Coptic Egypt]] continued, especially during the earlier centuries, keeping some contacts with Europe.  There was an early formative stage from 600-900 and the development of regional styles from 900 onwards.  Early Islamic art used mosaic artists and sculptors trained in the Byzantine and Coptic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|pp=256–262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of wall-paintings, Islamic art used painted [[tile]]s, from as early as 862-3 (at the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque]] of [[Kairouan]] in modern [[Tunisia]]), which also spread to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[John Ruskin]], the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in [[Venice]] contains "three elements in exactly equal proportions — the Roman, the Lombard, and Arab. It is the central building of the world.&amp;nbsp;... the history of Gothic architecture is the history of the refinement and spiritualisation of Northern work under its influence".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'', [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/sov/1.html chapter 1, paras 25 and 29]; discussed pp.&amp;nbsp;49–56 here [https://books.google.com/books?id=QzI3Pf0TSn4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=Ruskin+Orientalism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TF5qlcqm2M&amp;sig=PwSUx7Ghq5kozj-Y7AIWLOxPlk8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3AqjTfWYOpG4hAfP2tDWCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ruskin%20Orientalism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Islamic rulers controlled at various points parts of Southern Italy and most of modern Spain and Portugal, as well as the [[Balkans]], all of which retained large Christian populations. The Christian [[Crusade]]rs equally ruled Islamic populations. [[Crusader art]] is mainly a hybrid of Catholic and Byzantine styles, with little Islamic influence, but the [[Mozarabic art]] of Christians in [[Al Andaluz]] seems to show considerable influence from Islamic art, though the results are little like contemporary Islamic works. Islamic influence can also be traced in the mainstream of Western medieval art, for example in the Romanesque portal at [[Moissac]] in southern France, where it shows in both decorative elements, like the scalloped edges to the doorway, the circular decorations on the [[lintel]] above, and also in having ''Christ in Majesty'' surrounded by musicians, which was to become a common feature of Western heavenly scenes, and probably derives from images of Islamic kings on their [[Divan (furniture)|diwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|pp=206–209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calligraphy]], ornament and the [[decorative arts]] generally were more important than in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Dalu &amp; Michell, George, (eds); ''The Arts of Islam'', [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], 9, 1976, {{ISBN|0-7287-0081-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pre-Romanesque'' is a term for architecture and to some extent pictorial and portable art found initially in Southern Europe (Spain, Italy and Southern France) between the Late Antique period to the start of the Romanesque period in the 11th century.  Northern European art gradually forms part of the movement after [[Christianization]] as it assimilates post-classical styles.  The [[Carolingian art]] of the [[Frankish Empire]], especially modern France and Germany, from roughly 780-900 takes its name from [[Charlemagne]] and is an art of the court circle and a few monastic centres under Imperial patronage, that consciously sought to revive "Roman" styles and standards as befitted the new [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire of the West]].  Some centres of Carolingian production also pioneered expressive styles in works like the [[Utrecht Psalter]] and [[Ebbo Gospels]].  Christian [[monumental sculpture]] is recorded for the first time, and depiction of the human figure in narrative scenes became confident for the first time in Northern art.  [[Carolingian architecture]] produced larger buildings than had been seen since Roman times, and the [[westwork]] and other innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinks|1974|loc=Parts II &amp; III}}; {{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|loc=ch. 2}}; {{Harvnb|Calkins|1979|loc=chs 11 &amp; 12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the dynasty there was a hiatus before a new dynasty brought a revival in Germany with [[Ottonian art]], again centred on the court and monasteries, with art that moved towards great expressiveness through simple forms that achieve monumentality even in small works like [[ivory]] [[relief]]s and [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|manuscript miniatures]], above all those of the [[Reichenau School]], such as the [[Pericopes of Henry II]] (1002–1012).  Later [[Anglo-Saxon art]] in England, from about 900, was expressive in a very different way, with agitated figures and even drapery perhaps best shown in the many pen drawings in manuscripts.  The [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic art]] of Christian Spain had strong Islamic influence, and a complete lack of interest in realism in its brilliantly coloured miniatures, where figures are presented as entirely flat patterns.  Both of these were to influence the formation in France of the Romanesque style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|pp=75–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanesque art==
{{Main|Romanesque art}}
[[File:Saint-Julien 03.jpg|thumb|[[Tympanum (architecture)|Tympanum]] at [[Saint-Julien-de-Jonzy]], mid-12th century. ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'' above, the ''[[Last Supper in Christian art|Last Supper]]'' below.]]

Romanesque art developed in the period between about 1000 to the rise of Gothic art in the 12th century, in conjunction with the rise of monasticism in Western Europe. The style developed initially in France, but spread to Christian Spain, England, Flanders, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere to become the first medieval style found all over Europe, though with regional differences.&lt;ref&gt;A complicated subject, covered in Dodwell (1993), 175, 223, 258 among many other passages.&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrival of the style coincided with a great increase in church-building, and in the size of [[cathedral]]s and larger churches; many of these were rebuilt in subsequent periods, but often reached roughly their present size in the Romanesque period.  [[Romanesque architecture]] is dominated by thick walls, massive structures conceived as a single organic form, with [[vault (architecture)|vault]]ed roofs and round-headed windows and arches.

Figurative sculpture, originally colourfully painted, plays an integral and important part in these buildings, in the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of columns, as well as around impressive [[Portal (architecture)|portals]], usually centred on a [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] above the main doors, as at [[Vézelay Abbey]] and [[Autun Cathedral]].  Reliefs are much more common than free-standing statues in stone, but Romanesque relief became much higher, with some elements fully detached from the wall behind.  Large carvings also became important, especially painted wooden [[crucifix]]es like the [[Gero Cross]] from the very start of the period, and figures of the [[Virgin Mary]] like the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]].  Royalty and the higher clergy began to commission life-size effigies for [[tomb monument]]s.   Some churches had massive pairs of [[bronze]] doors decorated with narrative relief panels, like the [[Gniezno Doors]] or those at [[Hildesheim]], "the first decorated bronze doors cast in one piece in the West since Roman times", and arguably the finest before the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|pp=145–149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most churches were extensively frescoed; a typical scheme had ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'' at the east (altar) end, a ''[[Last Judgement]]'' at the west end over the doors, and scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' facing [[typology (theology)|typologically]] matching [[Old Testament]] scenes on the [[nave]] walls.  The "greatest surviving monument of Romanesque wall painting", much reduced from what was originally there, is in the [[Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe]] near [[Poitiers]], where the rounded [[barrel vault]] of the [[nave]], the [[crypt]], [[portico]] and other areas retain most of their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henderson|1977|pp=190(quote)–195}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An equivalent cycle in [[Sant'Angelo in Formis]] at [[Capua]] in southern Italy by Italian painters trained by Greeks illustrates the continuing predominance of Byzantine style in much of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 167-169&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Moralia in Job MS dragonslayer.jpg|thumb|left|French [[historiated initial]] with men slaying a monster, from a theological manuscript.  1110–1115]]

Romanesque sculpture and painting is often extremely vigorous and expressive, and very inventive in terms of [[iconography]]—the subjects chosen and their treatment.  Though many features absorbed from classical art form part of the Romanesque style, Romanesque artists rarely intended to achieve any sort of classical effect, except perhaps in [[Mosan art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|pp=277 &amp; 284–288}}. {{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|p=149}}, says the bronze column at Hildesheim of c. 1020 "cannot be said to be Romanesque&amp;nbsp;... It stands apart as a curious Ottonian pastiche of a Roman monument&amp;nbsp;... never to be repeated"&lt;/ref&gt;  As art became seen by a wider section of the population, and because of challenges from new [[heresies]], art became more didactic, and the local church the "[[Poor Man's Bible]]".  At the same time grotesque beasts and monsters, and fights with or between them, were popular themes, to which religious meanings might be loosely attached, although this did not impress St [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who famously denounced such distractions in monasteries:&lt;blockquote&gt;But in the cloister, in the sight of the reading monks, what is the point of such ridiculous monstrosity, the strange kind of shapely shapelessness?  Why these unsightly monkeys, why these fierce lions, why the monstrous centaurs, why semi-humans, why spotted tigers, why fighting soldiers, why trumpeting huntsmen?&amp;nbsp;... In short there is such a variety and such a diversity of strange shapes everywhere that we may prefer to read the marbles rather than the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8csPCj2hPcC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Bernard+of+Clairvaux+decoration|title=Bernard's letter |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= 2006-01-01|accessdate=2011-06-11|isbn=978-1-888570-85-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  He might well have known the miniature at left, which was produced at [[Cîteaux Abbey]] before the young Bernard was transferred from there in 1115.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 212–214. The MS is the [[Dijon]] ''[[Moralia in Job]]'' of [[Gregory the Great]].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period [[typology (theology)|typology]] became the dominant approach in theological literature and art to interpreting the bible, with [[Old Testament]] incidents seen as pre-figurations of aspects of the life of Christ, and shown paired with their corresponding New Testament episode.  Often the iconography of the New Testament scene was based on traditions and models originating in Late Antiquity, but the iconography of the Old Testament episode had to be invented in this period, for lack of precedents.  New themes such as the [[Tree of Jesse]] were devised, and representations of [[God the Father]] became more acceptable.  The vast majority of surviving art is religious. [[Mosan art]] was an especially refined regional style, with much superb metalwork surviving, often combined with [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], and elements of classicism rare in Romanesque art, as in the [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]], or the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]] at [[Cologne]], one of a number of surviving works by [[Nicholas of Verdun]], whose services were sought across north-western Europe.

[[Stained glass]] became a significant art-form in the period, though little Romanesque glass survives.  In illuminated manuscripts the bible became a new focus of intensive decoration, with the [[psalter]] also remaining important.  The strong emphasis on the suffering of Christ and other sacred figures entered Western art in this period, a feature that strongly distinguishes it from both Byzantine and classical art for the remainder of the Middle Ages and beyond.  The Gero Cross of 965-970, at the cusp of Ottonian and Romanesque art, has been called the first work to exhibit this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|p=271}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The end of the Romanesque period saw the start of the greatly increased emphasis on the [[Virgin Mary]] in theology, literature and so also art that was to reach its full extent in the Gothic period.

==Gothic art==

[[File:Chartres cathedral 023 martyrs S TTaylor.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chartres cathedral]] c. 1220; the best High Gothic sculpture had largely rediscovered the art of naturalistic figure representation.]]
Gothic art is a variable term depending on the craft, place and time. The term originated with the [[Gothic architecture]] which developed in France from about 1137 with the rebuilding of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey Church of St Denis]].  As with Romanesque architecture, this included [[Gothic sculpture|sculpture]] as an integral part of the style, with even larger [[Portal (architecture)|portals]] and other figures on the [[facade]]s of churches the location of the most important sculpture, until the late period, when large carved [[altarpiece]]s and [[reredos]], usually in painted and gilded wood, became an important focus in many churches.  [[Gothic painting]] did not appear until around 1200 (this date has many qualifications), when it diverged from Romanesque style.  A [[Gothic sculpture|Gothic style in sculpture]] originates in France around 1144  and spread throughout Europe, becoming by the 13th century the international style, replacing Romanesque, though in sculpture and painting the transition was not as sharp as in architecture.

The majority of Romanesque cathedrals and large churches were replaced by Gothic buildings, at least in those places benefiting from the economic growth of the period—Romanesque architecture is now best seen in areas that were subsequently relatively depressed, like many  southern regions of France and Italy, or northern Spain.  The new architecture allowed for much larger windows, and stained glass of a quality never excelled is perhaps the type of art most associated in the popular mind with the Gothic, although churches with nearly all their original glass, like the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, are extremely rare anywhere, and unknown in Britain.

Most Gothic wall-paintings have also disappeared; these remained very common, though in parish churches often rather crudely executed.  Secular buildings also often had wall-paintings, although royalty preferred the much more expensive tapestries, which were carried along as they travelled between their many palaces and castles, or taken with them on military campaigns—the finest collection of late-medieval textile art comes from the Swiss booty at the [[Battle of Nancy]], when they defeated and killed [[Charles the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], and captured all his baggage train.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Historical Museum of Bern]] has many of the best pieces, and these and others were shown in an exhibition on Philip in Bern, Bruges and Vienna in 2008-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duccio maesta1021.jpg|thumb|The central panel of [[Duccio]]'s huge [[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà]] [[altarpiece]] for [[Siena Cathedral]].]]
As mentioned in the previous section, the Gothic period coincided with a greatly increased emphasis on the Virgin Mary, and it was in this period that the [[Virgin and Child]] became such a hallmark of Catholic art.  Saints were also portrayed far more often, and many of the range of [[Saint symbolism|attributes]] developed to identify them visually for a still largely illiterate public first appeared.

During this period [[panel painting]] for altarpieces, often [[polyptych]]es and smaller works became newly important.  Previously [[icon]]s on panels had been much more common in Byzantine art than in the West, although many now lost panel paintings made in the West are documented from much earlier periods, and initially Western painters on panel were very largely under the sway of Byzantine models, especially in Italy, from where most early Western panel paintings come.  The process of establishing a distinct Western style was begun by [[Cimabue]] and [[Duccio]], and completed by [[Giotto]], who is traditionally regarded as the starting point for the development of Renaissance painting.  Most panel painting remained more conservative than miniature painting however, partly because it was seen by a wide public.
[[File:Reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem'', Burgundian miniature, c. 1460.]]

[[International Gothic]] describes courtly Gothic art from about 1360 to 1430, after which Gothic art begins to merge into the [[Renaissance art]] that had begun to form itself in Italy during the [[Trecento]], with a return to classical principles of composition and realism, with the sculptor [[Nicola Pisano]] and the painter [[Giotto]] as especially formative figures.  The [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] is one of the best known works of International Gothic.  The transition to the Renaissance occurred at different times in different places - [[Early Netherlandish painting]] is poised between the two, as is the Italian painter [[Pisanello]]. Outside Italy Renaissance styles appeared in some works in courts and some wealthy cities while other works, and all work beyond these centres of innovation, continued late Gothic styles for a period of some decades.  The [[Protestant Reformation]] often provided an end point for the Gothic tradition in areas that went Protestant, as it was associated with Catholicism.

The invention of a comprehensive mathematically based system of [[linear perspective]] is a defining achievement of the early-15th-century [[Italian Renaissance]] in [[Florence]], but Gothic painting had already made great progress in the naturalistic depiction of distance and volume, though it did not usually regard them as essential features of a work if other aims conflicted with them, and late Gothic sculpture was increasingly naturalistic. In the mid-15th century Burgundian miniature (right) the artist seems keen to show his skill at representing buildings and blocks of stone obliquely, and managing scenes at different distances.  But his general attempt to reduce the size of more distant elements is unsystematic. Sections of the composition are at a similar scale, with relative distance shown by overlapping, [[foreshortening]], and further objects being higher than nearer ones, though the workmen at left do show finer adjustment of size. But this is abandoned on the right where the most important figure is much larger than the mason.
[[File:Totentanz blockbook q.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Death comes for the Cardinal'', from a printed [[blockbook]] with hand colour, c. 1455–58, an early example of the [[Dance of Death]].]]

The end of the period includes new media such as [[old master print|prints]]; along with small panel paintings these were frequently used for the emotive [[andachtsbilder]] ("devotional images") influenced by new religious trends of the period.  These were images of moments detached from the narrative of the [[Passion of Christ]] designed for meditation on his sufferings, or those of the Virgin: the [[Man of Sorrows]], [[Pietà]], [[Veil of Veronica]] or [[Arma Christi]]. The trauma of the [[Black Death]] in the mid-14th century was at least partly responsible for the popularity of themes such as the ''[[Dance of Death]]'' and ''[[Memento mori]]''.  In the cheap [[blockbook]]s with text (often in the [[vernacular]]) and images cut in a single [[woodcut]], works such as that illustrated (left), the ''[[Ars Moriendi]]'' (''Art of Dying'') and typological verse summaries of the bible like the ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'' (''Mirror of Human Salvation'') were the most popular.

[[Renaissance Humanism]] and the rise of a wealthy urban middle class, led by merchants, began to transform the old social context of art, with the revival of realistic portraiture and the appearance of printmaking and the [[self-portrait]], together with the decline of forms like stained glass and the illuminated manuscript.  [[Donor portrait]]s, in the Early Medieval period largely the preserve of popes, kings and abbots, now showed businessmen and their families, and churches were becoming crowded with the [[tomb monument]]s of the well-off.

The typical exuberantly decorated margins descend from [[insular art]], and are unlike anything in the Byzantine tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Plummer|1964|loc=plates 1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[book of hours]], a type of manuscript normally owned by laymen, or even more often, laywomen, became the type of manuscript most often heavily illustrated from the 14th century onwards, and also by this period, the lead in producing miniatures had passed to lay artists, also very often women.  In the most important centres of illumination, Paris and in the 15th century the cities of [[Flanders]], there were large workshops, exporting to other parts of Europe.  Other forms of art, such as small ivory reliefs, stained glass, tapestries and [[Nottingham alabaster]]s (cheap carved panels for altarpieces) were produced in similar conditions, and artists and craftsmen in cities were usually covered by the [[guild]] system—the [[goldsmith]]'s guild was typically among the richest in a city, and painters were members of a special [[Guild of St Luke]] in many places.

Secular works, often using subjects concerned with [[courtly love]] or [[chivalry|knightly heroism]], were produced as illuminated manuscripts, carved ivory mirror-cases, tapestries and elaborate gold table centrepieces like [[Nef (metalwork)|nefs]].  It begins to be possible to distinguish much greater numbers of individual artists, some of whom had international reputations.  Art collectors begin to appear, of manuscripts among the great nobles, like [[John, Duke of Berry]] (1340–1416) and of prints and other works among those with moderate wealth.  In the wealthier areas tiny cheap religious [[woodcut]]s brought art in an approximation of the latest style even into the homes of peasants by the late 15th century.

==Subsequent reputation==

Medieval art had little sense of its own art history, and this disinterest was continued in later periods.  The Renaissance generally dismissed it as a "barbarous" product of the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]", and the [[Gothic architecture#The term "Gothic"|term "Gothic"]] was invented as a deliberately pejorative one, first used by the painter [[Raphael]] in a letter of 1519 to characterise all that had come between the demise of Classical art and its supposed 'rebirth' in the [[Renaissance]]. The term was subsequently adopted and popularised in the mid 16th century by the Florentine artist and historian, [[Giorgio Vasari]], who used it to denigrate northern European architecture generally. Illuminated manuscripts continued to be collected by [[antiquarian]]s, or sit unregarded in monastic or royal libraries, but paintings were mostly of interest if they had historical associations with royalty or others.  The long period of mistreatment of the [[Westminster Retable]] by [[Westminster Abbey]] is an example; until the 19th century it was only regarded as a useful piece of timber.  But their large portrait of [[Richard II of England]] was well looked after, like another portrait of Richard, the [[Wilton Diptych]] (illustrated above).  As in the Middle Ages themselves, other objects have often survived mainly because they were considered to be [[relic]]s.

There was no equivalent for pictorial art of the "[[Gothic survival]]" found in architecture, once the style had finally died off in Germany, England and [[Scandinavia]], and the [[Gothic Revival]] long focused on [[Gothic Architecture]] rather than art.  The understanding of the succession of styles was still very weak, as suggested by the title of [[Thomas Rickman]]'s pioneering book on English architecture: ''An Attempt to discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation'' (1817).  This began to change with a vengeance by the mid-19th century, as appreciation of medieval sculpture and its painting, known as Italian or Flemish "Primitives", became fashionable under the influence of writers including [[John Ruskin]], [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], and [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]], as well as the romantic [[medievalism]] of literary works like Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' (1819) and [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1831).  Early collectors of the "Primitives", then still relatively cheap, included [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]].

Among artists the German [[Nazarene movement]] from 1809 and English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] from 1848 both rejected the values of at least the later Renaissance, but in practice, and despite sometimes depicting medieval scenes, their work draws its influences mostly from the [[Early Renaissance]] rather than the Gothic or earlier periods - the early graphic work of [[John Millais]] being something of an exception.&lt;ref&gt;In works like [http://www.preraphaelites.org/the-collection/1906P646/the-death-of-romeo-and-juliet-compositional-study/ this], stylistically very different from the finished painting.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Morris]], also a discriminating collector of medieval art, absorbed medieval style more thoroughly into his work, as did [[William Burges]].[[File:Meister von Castelseprio 001.jpg|thumb|left|''Joseph's Dream'' from the Byzantinesque [[fresco]]s at [[Castelseprio]], the subject of much controversy since their discovery in 1944, and now generally dated to the 10th century.]]By the later 19th century many book-illustrators and producers of decorative art of various kinds had learned to use medieval styles successfully from the new museums like the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] set up for this purpose.  At the same time the new academic field of [[art history]], dominated by Germany and France, concentrated heavily on medieval art and was soon very productive in cataloguing and dating the surviving works, and analysing the development of medieval styles and iconography; though the Late Antique and pre-Carolingian period remained a less explored "no-man's land" until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|pp=1(quote)–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franz Theodor Kugler]] was the first to name and describe Carolingian art in 1837; like many art historians of the period he sought to find and promote the national spirit of his own nation in art history, a search begun by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] in the 18th century.  Kugler's pupil, the great Swiss art historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], though he could not be called a specialist in medieval art, was an important figure in developing the understanding of it.  Medieval art was now heavily collected, both by museums and private collectors like [[George Salting]], the [[Rothschild family]] and [[John Pierpont Morgan]].

After the decline of the [[Gothic Revival]], and the [[Celtic Revival]] use of Insular styles, the anti-realist and expressive elements of medieval art have still proved an inspiration for many modern artists.

German-speaking art historians continued to dominate medieval art history, despite figures like [[Émile Mâle]] (1862–1954) and [[Henri Focillon]] (1881–1943), until the Nazi period, when a large number of important figures emigrated, mostly to Britain or America, where the academic study of art history was still developing.  These included the elderly [[Adolph Goldschmidt]] and younger figures including [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], [[Ernst Kitzinger]], [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Kurt Weitzmann]], [[Richard Krautheimer]] and many others.  [[Meyer Schapiro]] had immigrated as a child in 1907.

== Prejudice ==
During the Middle Ages some Christian art was used as a way to express prejudices and commonly held negative views that were held against other religions and groups of people.

=== Jewish portrayals in medieval Christian art ===
[[File:Ecclesia et synagoga.jpg|thumb|Ecclesia and Sinagoga at the&amp;nbsp;Notre Dame Cathedral]]

In Medieval Europe between the 5th and 15th century many Christians viewed Jews as enemies and outsiders due to a variety of factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jewm/hd_jewm.htm|title=Jews and the Arts in Medieval Europe|last=Holcomb|first=Barbara Drake|last2=Holcomb|first2=Melanie|date=June 2008|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also tended to hate them for being both culturally and religiously different as well as because of religious teachings that held negative views of Jewish people such as portrayals of the Antichrist as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdtSQ9v9T3IC&amp;pg=PA383&amp;lpg=PA383&amp;dq=Lipton+%22jewish+hat%22+enemies+of+Christ&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EqtM2kWlYN&amp;sig=2O0Qt5N7Wf9Ka_216Mh4F93xodc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-hpal5t_XAhVGqlQKHYCABtMQ6AEIQjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lipton%20%22jewish%20hat%22%20enemies%20of%20Christ&amp;f=false|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Monsters and the Monstrous|last=Mittman|first=Asa Simon|last2=Dendle|first2=Peter J.|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=|isbn=9781472418012|location=|pages=383|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Jewish people's economic position as moneylenders, coupled with royal protections that were given to them,{{Example needed|date=June 2018}} created a strained relationship between Jews and Christians. This strain manifested itself in several ways, one of which was through the creation of [[Medieval antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Anti-Judaism in early Christianity|anti-Judaism]] art and propaganda that served the purpose of discrediting both Jews and their religious beliefs as well as spreading these beliefs even further into society.  Late medieval images of [[Ecclesia and Synagoga]] represented the Christian doctrine of [[Supersessionism|supercessionism]], whereby the Christian [[New Covenant]] had replaced the Jewish [[Mosaic covenant]]&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Christine, "The Jewish Mother-in-law; Synagoga and the ''Man of Law's Tale''", pp. 8-11, in Delany, Sheila (ed), ''Chaucer and the Jews : Sources, Contexts, Meanings'', 2002, Routledge, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T6YMJAuDAdEC&amp;pg=PA8 google books], {{ISBN|0-415-93882-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-93882-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sara Lipton has argued that some portrayals, such as depictions of Jewish blindness in the presence of Jesus, were meant to serve as a form of self-reflection rather than be explicitly anti-Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9f6gBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq|title=Dark Mirror: The Medieval Origins of Anti-Jewish Iconography|last=Lipton|first=Sara|date=2014-11-04|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780805079104|location=|pages=5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2013 book ''Saracens, Demons, and Jews'', Debra Higgs Strickland argues that negative portrayals of Jews in medieval art can be divided into three categories: art that focused on physical descriptions, art that featured signs of damnation, and images that depicted Jews as monsters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Physical depictions of Jewish people in medieval Christian art were often men with pointed [[Jewish hat]]s and long beards, which was done as a derogatory symbol and to separate Jews from Christians in a clear manner. This portrayal would grow more virulent over time, however Jewish women lacked similar distinctive physical descriptions in high medieval Christian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lipton|first=Sara|date=2008|title=Where Are the Gothic Jewish Women?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28347">The traditions of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] '''Mesoamerican literature''' extend back to the oldest-attested forms of early [[writing]] in the [[Mesoamerica]]n region, which date from around the mid-[[1st millennium BC|1st millennium BCE]]. Many of the [[pre-Columbian]] cultures of Mesoamerica are known to have been [[literacy|literate]] societies, who produced a number of [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] of varying degrees of complexity and completeness. Mesoamerican writing systems arose independently from other [[writing systems]] in the world,  and their development represents one of the very few such origins in the [[history of writing]]. The conquistadors brought their distinctive cultural baggage, in the form of books, from Spain to the New World.

The literature and texts created by indigenous Mesoamericans are the earliest-known from [[the Americas]] for primarily two reasons: Firstly the fact that the native populations of Mesoamerica were the first to enter into intensive contact with Europeans, assuring that many samples of Mesoamerican literature have been documented in surviving and intelligible forms.  Secondly, the long tradition of Mesoamerican writing which undoubtedly contributed to the native Mesoamericans readily embracing the [[Latin alphabet]] of the Spaniards and creating many literary works written in it during the first centuries after the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]]. This article summarizes current knowledge about indigenous Mesoamerican literatures in its broadest sense and describe it categorized by its literary contents and social functions.

[[File:Codex Borbonicus, p11 trecena13.PNG|right|300px|thumb|A reproduction of the original page 13 of the [[Codex Borbonicus]], showing elements of an almanac associated with the 13th ''[[trecena]]'' of the ''[[tonalpohualli]]'', the [[Aztec]] version of the [[260-day Mesoamerican calendar]].]]

==Precolumbian literature==
When defining literature in its broadest possible sense including all products of "literacy", what becomes primarily interesting about a literate community is the manner in which literacy and literature is used.  Which topics are chosen to be written and spoken about? And why did they do it?  Which genres of literature are found in Mesoamerica?
The answer to this question is complex and is the topic of the rest of this article that will try to describe and resume what is known about the genres and functions of indigenous Mesoamerican literatures.

Three major subjects of Mesoamerican literatures can be identified:
*Religion, time and astronomy : Mesoamerican civilizations shared an interest in the recording and keeping track of time through observation of celestial bodies and religious rituals celebrating their different phases. Not surprisingly a large portion of the Mesoamerican literature that has been delivered down through time to us deals exactly with this kind of information. Particularly the true precolumbian literature such as the [[Mayan codices|Mayan]] and [[Aztec codices]]  deal with calendrical and astronomical information as well as describing the rituals connected to the passing of time.
*History, power and legacy: Another large part of the Precolumbian literature is found carved into monumental structures such as stelae, altars  and temples. This kind of literature typically documents power and heritage, memorize victories, ascension to rulership, dedications of monuments, marriages between royal lineages.
* Mythical and fictive genres. Mostly present in postconquest versions but often relying on oral or pictorial traditions the mythical and narrative literature of Mesoamerica is very rich, and we can only guess as to how much has been lost.
*Every day literature. Some texts are sort of every day literature such as descriptions of objects and their owners, graffiti inscriptions, but these only constitutes a very small part of the known literature.

===Pictorial vs. linguistic literature===

[[Geoffrey Sampson]] distinguishes between two kinds of writing. One kind of writing he calls 'semasiographical', this covers kinds of pictorial or [[ideographic]] writing that is not necessarily connected to [[phonetic]] language but can be read in different languages, this kind of writing is for example used in roadsigns which can be read in any language. The other kind of writing is phonetic writing called by Sampson 'glottographic' writing and which represents the sounds and words of languages and allows accurate linguistic readings of a text that is the same at every reading.{{sfnp|Sampson|1985}} In Mesoamerica the two types were not distinguished, and so writing, drawing, and making pictures were seen as closely related if not identical concepts. In both the [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] and [[Nahuatl languages|Aztec]] languages there is one word for writing '''and''' drawing ((''tlàcuiloa'' in Nahuatl and ''tz'iib' '' in [[Classic Maya language|Classic Maya]])) Pictures are sometimes read phonetically and texts meant to be read are sometimes very pictorial in nature. This makes it difficult for modern day scholars to distinguish between whether an inscription in a [[Mesoamerican writing systems|Mesoamerican script]] represents spoken language or is to be interpreted as a descriptive drawing. The only Mesoamerican people known without doubt to have developed a completely glottographic or phonetic script is the Maya, and even the Mayan script is largely pictorial and often shows fuzzy boundaries between images and text. Scholars disagree on the phoneticity of other Mesoamerican scripts and [[iconography|iconographic]] styles, but many show use of the [[Rebus principle]] and a highly conventionalised set of [[symbology|symbols]].

===Monumental Inscriptions===
[[File:NaranjoStela10Maler.jpg|100px|right|thumb|An Monumental inscription in Maya hieroglyphics from the site of [[Naranjo]], relating to the reign of king ''Itzamnaaj K'awil'']]
The monumental inscriptions were often historical records of the citystates:
Famous examples include:
*Hieroglyphic Stair of Copan recording the history of [[Copan]] with 7000 glyphs on its 62 steps.
*The inscriptions of [[Naj Tunich]] records the arrival of noble pilgrims to the sacred cave.
*The tomb inscriptions of [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal|Pacal]] the famous ruler of Palenque.
*The many stelae of [[Yaxchilan]], [[Quiriguá]], [[Copán]], [[Tikal]] and [[Palenque]] and countless other Mayan archaeological sites.

The function of these kinds of historical inscriptions also served to consoliate the power of the rulers who used them also as a kind of propaganda testimonies to their power. Most commonly monumental hieroglyphocal texts describe:
*Lordship: ascension and death of rulers, and the claiming of ancestry from noble lineages
*Warfare: Victories and conquest
*Alliances: Marriages between lineages.
*Dedications of monuments and buildings

The epigrapher David Stuart writes about the differences in content between the monumental hieroglyphical texts of Yaxchilan and those of Copan:   
:"The major themes of the known Yaxchilan monuments are war, dance, and bloodletting rituals, with several records of architectural dedicatory rites." Most of the records of wars and dances accompany scenes of the rulers, who are featured prominently in all of the texts. Copán's texts have a far lesser emphasis on historical narrative. The stelae of the great plaza, for example, are inscribed with dedicatory formulae that name the ruler as "owner" of the monument, but they seldom if ever record any ritual or historical activity. Birth dates at Copán are virtually nonexistent, as also are records of war and capture. The Copán rulers therefore lack some of the personalized history we read in the texts of newer centers in the western lowlands, such as Palenque, Yaxchilan, and Piedras Negras."&lt;ref&gt;David Stuart, [https://web.archive.org/web/20081216020327/http://www.peabody.harvard.edu/Copan/text.html David Stuart writes about the inscriptions of Copán]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Codices===
;: See also [[Mayan codices]] and [[Aztec codices]] for fuller descriptions of a number of codices.
Most codices date from the colonial era, with only a few surviving from the [[Precolumbian|prehispanic era]]. A number of Precolumbian codices written on ''[[amate]]'' paper with gesso coating remain today.

==Postconquest literatures written in Latin script==
[[File:The_Florentine_Codex-_Aztec_Feather_Painters_III.tif|thumb|right|Aztec feather artisans or painters. [[Florentine Codex]] (ca. 1576) with native drawings and [[Nahuatl]] text]]
The largest part of the Mesoamerican literature today known has been fixed in writing after the Spanish conquest. Both Europeans and Mayans began writing down local oral tradition using the Latin alphabet to write in indigenous languages shortly after the conquest. Many of those Europeans were [[friars]] and priests who in trying to convert the natives to Christianity. They translated Catholic catechisms and confessional manuals and acquired a good grasp of the indigenous languages and often even composed grammars and dictionaries of the indigenous languages.  These early grammars of native languages systematized the reading and writing of indigenous languages in their own time and help us understand them today.

The most widely known early grammars and dictionaries are of the Aztec language, Nahuatl. Famous examples are the works written by [[Alonso de Molina]] and [[Andrés de Olmos]]. But also Mayan and other Mesoamerican languages have early grammars and dictionaries, some of very high quality.

The introduction of the Latin alphabet and the elaboration of conventions for writing indigenous languages allowed for the subsequent creation of a wide range of texts. And indigenous writers took advantage of the new techniques to document their own history and tradition in the new writing, while monks kept on extending literacy in the indigenous population. This tradition lasted only a few centuries however and due to royal decrees about Spanish being the only language of the Spanish empire by the mid-1700s most indigenous languages were left without a living tradition for writing. Oral literature, however, kept being transmitted to this day in many indigenous languages and began to be collected by ethnologists in the beginnings of the 20th century, however without promoting native language literacy in the communities in which they worked. It is an important and extremely difficult job in the Mesoamerica of today, and what that is only beginning to be undertaken, to return native language literacy to the indigenous peoples. But during the first post-conquest centuries a large number of texts in indigenous Mesoamerican languages were generated.

===Codices of major importance===
[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 2r.jpg|thumb|left|Founding of [[Tenochtitlan]], [[Codex Mendoza]]]].
::*[[Codex Mendoza]]
::*[[Florentine Codex]]. A twelve-volume work composed under the direction of [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] and sent to Europe in 1576. Separate books deal with Aztec religion, divinatory practices; lords and rulers; elite long-distance merchants [[pochteca]]; commoners; the "earthly things" including a compendium of information on flora and fauna; rocks and soil types. Volume 12 is a history of the conquest from the Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco viewpont. It is called the "Florentine Codex" because it was found in a library in Florence, Italy.

===Historical accounts===
[[Image:NunoBeltranGuzman-1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Conquistador [[Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán]] as depicted in the annal[[Codex Telleriano Remensis]]]]
Many of the post-conquest texts are historical accounts, either in the form of annals recounting year by year the events of a people or city-state often based on pictorial documents or oral accounts of aged community members. But also sometimes personalized literary accounts of the life of a people or state and almost always incorporating both mythical material and actual history. There was no formal distinction between the two in Mesoamerica. Sometimes as in the case of the Mayan [[Chilam Balam]] books historical accounts also incorporated prophetical material, a kind of ''history in advance''.

===Administrative documents ===
{{Main|New Philology}}
The post-conquest situation of the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica also required them to learn to navigate in a complex new administrative system. In order to obtain any kinds of favorable positions pleas and petitions had to be made to the new authorities and land possessions and heritages had to be proven. This resulted in a large corpus of administrative literature in indigenous languages, because documents were often written in the native language first and later translated into Spanish. Historians of central Mexican peoples draw heavily on native-language documentation, most notably [[Charles Gibson (historian)|Charles Gibson]] in ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'' (1964)&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule''. Stanford University Press 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] in ''The Nahuas After the Conquest'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest''. Stanford University Press 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis on native-language documentation for indigenous history has been emphasized in the [[New Philology]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Restall, "A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History", ''Latin American Research Review'' - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp. 113–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'', James Lockhart, Lisa Sousa, and Stephanie Wood (eds.), Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

These administrative documents include a large number of:
[[File:Oztoticpac_Lands_Aztec_1540_milcocolli_tlahuelmantli.jpg|thumb|left|Oztoticpac Lands Map]]
*'''Testaments''' (legal wills of individual indigenous, sometimes kept together as books of testaments). Testaments have been utilized as a source of information on individuals, and where they appear as clusters, they give even fuller information about indigenous culture, kin relations, and economic practices.  Starting in 1976, testaments have been published as an example of the potential of Mesoamerican native-language documentation, part of what is currently called the [[New Philology]].  A number collections of wills have been published, including four volumes resulting from a Mexican government-funded project ''La vida cotidiana indígena y su transformación en la época colonial a través de los testamentos''.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Rojas Rabiela, et al.''Vidas y bienes olvidados: Testamentos indigenas novohispanos''. (Mexico: CIESAS/CONACYT 1999-2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some particularly rich collections of wills have been published, followed by a monograph utilizing them.  In recent years, anthologies of indigenous testaments have been published from Mesoamerica and elsewhere.

===''Relaciones geográficas''===
{{Main|Relaciones geográficas}}
In the late sixteenth-century the Spanish crown sought systematic information about indigenous settlements now part of the [[Spanish Empire]]. A questionnaire was drawn up and local Spanish officials gathered information from the indigenous towns under their administration, using local elites as their informants. Some reports were a few pages, such as that from [[Culhuacan (altepetl)|Culhuacan]], while some major indigenous polities, such as Tlaxcala, took the opportunity to give a detailed description of their prehispanic history and participation in the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire|Spanish conquest of central Mexico]].  Most geographical accounts include a native map of the settlement. The ''[[Relaciones geográficas]]'' were produced because colonial officials complied with royal instructions, but their content was generated by indigenous informants or authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard F. Cline]], "The Relaciones Geográficas of the Spanish Indies, 1577-1586." ''[[Hispanic American Historical Review]]'' 44, (1964) 341-374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "A Census of the Relaciones Geográficas, 1579-1612." ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]], vol. 12: 324-69. Austin: University of Texas Press 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara E. Mundy, ''The Mapping of New Spain: Indigenous Cartography and the Maps of the Relaciones Geográficas''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythological narratives===
The most extensively researched Mesoamerican indigenous literature is the literature containing mythological and legendary narratives. The styles of these books is often very poetic and appealing to modern aesthetic senses both because of the poetic language and its "mystical", exotic contents. It is also of interest to establish [[intertextuality]] between cultures. While many do include actual historic events the mythological texts can often be distinguished by focusing on claiming a mythical source to power by tracing the lineage of a people to some ancient source of power.{{sfnp|Carrasco|1998}}

*[[Popol Vuh]] (the legendary mythological history of the [[K'iche' people|Quiché people]])
*[[Codex Chimalpopoca]] (the main source of the Aztec creation myth of the [[Five Suns]])
*[[Codex Aubin]] (recounting the mythical wanderings of the Mexica from Aztlan and to Tenochtitlan)
*[[Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca]] (the Aztec myth of the legendary Toltec and Chichimec peoples)

===Poetry===
Some famous collections of Aztec poetry have been conserved. Although written in the late 16th century they are believed to be fairly representative of the actual style of poetry used in precolumbian times. Many of the poems are attributed to named Aztec rulers such as [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]]. Because the poems were transcribed at a later date, scholars dispute whether these are the actual authors. Many of the mythical and historical texts also have poetic qualities.

'''Aztec poetry'''
*[[Cantares Mexicanos]]
*[[Romances de los Señores de Nueva España]]

'''Mayan poetry'''
* [[Songs of Dzitbalche]]

===Theatre===

===Ethnographic accounts===
*''Florentine Codex'' ([[Bernardino de Sahagún]]s masterpiece of an ethnographic account contained in 12 volumes)
*''Coloquios y doctrina Christiana'' (also known as the Bancroft dialogues, describing the first dialogues between Aztecs and monks preaching Christianity)

===Collections of disparate treatises===
Not all specimens of native literature can be readily classified. A prime example of this are the Yucatec Mayan Books of [[Chilam Balam]], mentioned above for their historical content, but also containing treatises on medical lore, astrology, etc. Although clearly belonging to Maya literature, they are profoundly syncretic in nature.

"'''Mortal Coil'''" is the twelfth episode of the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 4)|fourth season]] of the American [[Science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', the 80th episode overall. The episode originally aired on December 17, 1997, on the [[UPN]] network. Directed by [[Allan Kroeker]], it was written by [[Bryan Fuller]], and produced by [[Kenneth Biller]] and [[Joe Menosky]].

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] and [[Maquis (Star Trek)|Maquis]] crew of the starship [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']] after they were stranded in the [[Delta Quadrant]] far from the rest of the [[Federation (Star Trek)|Federation]]. In this episode, it deals with a starring character's death, resurrection, and crisis of faith.

==Plot==
[[Neelix]]  is killed while participating in a survey mission of a protomatter [[nebula]]. Using a technique devised by [[Seven of Nine]] , however, the [[Doctor (Star Trek)|Doctor]]  is able to revive Neelix after being dead for nearly 19 hours. Distressed that he had not perceived the [[afterlife]] while he was dead, Neelix begins to question his [[religion|religious beliefs]]. With the aid of [[Chakotay]], Neelix embarks on a [[spirit]]ual [[vision quest]], during which he confronts his dead sister, Alixia, who mocks him and then dies and crumbles into dust. He then finds himself on a slab, surrounded by visions of his shipmates, who tell him that life is irrelevant and that he knows what he has to do.

Convinced that his existence is meaningless and that his life has no purpose, Neelix decides to commit [[suicide]] by [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporting]] himself into the nebula. Despite the attempts of his shipmates, Neelix prepares to beam off until [[Starfleet ranks and insignia#The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager|Ensign]] [[Samantha Wildman]] arrives to ask Neelix if he could console [[Naomi Wildman|Naomi]], who believes she saw a [[monster]] in the [[Replicator (Star Trek)|replicator]] and who will only allow Neelix to tuck her in. Realizing that he does, indeed, have purpose in his life, Neelix relents and heads for the Wildmans' quarters. Once there, Naomi, who had heard that Neelix was sick, wonders if a monster had got him. "Yes", Neelix replies, "But I chased him away."&lt;ref name="VOY Companion"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruditis |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Ruditis |title=Star Trek Voyager Companion |year=2003 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |location=New York |isbn=0-7434-1751-8| pages=217–219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theme===
In this episode, Neelix's religious faith is seriously challenged; he eventually chooses to live without it. [[Chakotay]] serves as a counterpoint to his perspective, encouraging Neelix not to abandon all faith. In ''Star Trek: The Human Frontier'', Michèle and [[Duncan Barrett]] discuss this episode as an example of Star Trek's shifting attitudes towards religion, specifically ''Voyager''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s treatment of religious faith and how it can change. The Barretts contrast this episode with "[[Sacred Ground (Star Trek: Voyager)|Sacred Ground]]," in which the rationalist [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]] ([[Kate Mulgrew]]) is forced to accept the possibility of forces outside rational explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barrett |first=Michèle |author2=Duncan Barrett |title=Star Trek: The Human Frontier |year=2000 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=New York |isbn= 0-415-92982-2 |pages=148–149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both episodes are considered as illustrations of how "Star Trek articulates the conflicts between religion and science that continue to recur in modern western thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barrett |first=Michèle |author2=Duncan Barrett |title=Star Trek: The Human Frontier |year=2000 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=New York |isbn= 0-415-92982-2 |page=145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Ethan Phillips.jpg|thumb|Ethan Phillips portrayed Neelix, resurrected protagonist]]
[[Ethan Phillips]], who plays [[Neelix]], said he felt the episode was the most rewarding of the show for him, and that it was one of his favorites. "I thought that was a beautiful show," he said, "It was very existential [...] and very well directed by [[Allan Kroeker]]."&lt;ref name="STC20010201"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/community/chat/archive/transcript/1240.html|title = Community :: Chat :: Transcript Archive :: Ethan Phillips ("Neelix" - VOY)|date= 2001-02-01|accessdate = 2007-07-25|work = STARTREK.COM|publisher = [[CBS Paramount Television]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">The '''National Music League''' (NML) was an American arts organization based in [[New York City]] that was active during the 1920s through the 1960s. Founded as a non-profit institution in June 1925, the organization was dedicated to supporting and furthering the careers of talented young American classical musicians. While its goals remained the same, the organization became a for-profit incorporated institution in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00C10F83E5F167B93C4A9178DD85F4C8485F9|title=From the Mail Pouch: Music League|author=[[Harold V. Milligan]]|date=June 6, 1948 | work=The New York Times}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert E. Simon]] served as the organizations president for many years and [[Leon Barzin]] served as vice president.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1948/05/30/archives/help-on-the-way-up-national-music-league-a-cooperative-gives-young.html?sq=%2522+National+Music+League%2522&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p|title=HELP ON THE WAY UP; National Music League, a Cooperative, Gives Young Artists a Start|author=[[Olin Downes]]|date=May 30, 1948 | work=The New York Times}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization ceased operations in the early 1960s.

The NML selected artists to support through annual competitive music auditions. Judges for the competition were leading musicians and teachers in the New York area, often pulling from faculty members at the [[Juilliard School]] and [[Manhattan School of Music]]. The only requirement to compete was that the artist be under the age of 30. Winners of the competition were then awarded by having a concert series organized and promoted for them by the NML, thereby helping them to gain wider public recognition. Artists who were supported by the NML included [[Josephine Antoine]], [[Frances Blaisdell]], [[Jean Carlton]], [[Risë Stevens]], and [[Thomas Llyfnwy Thomas]] among many others.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

In 1935 the NML presented a production of [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]'s ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'' at the [[White House]] after a luncheon hosted by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. The cast notably included bass [[John Gurney (bass)|John Gurney]] of later [[Metropolitan Opera]] fame as Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A17FA355B107A93C3AA1788D85F418385F9&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=%22+National+Music+League%22&amp;st=p|title=HAENSEL AND GRETEL' GIVEN IN WHITE HOUSE; Performance by National Music League Follows Luncheon Party of First Lady.|work=The New York Times|date=March 31, 1935}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1950 the NML began a partnership with the [[Jeunesses Musicales International]] in France which resulted in an annual foreign-exchange of artists. The program would allow an American musician the opportunity to do a concert tour throughout France and a French artist a United States tour. American musicians to have participated in the exchange program to France included [[Sidney Harth]] (1951-1952), [[Theodore Lettvin]] (1951-1952), [[Lillian Kallir]] (1953), [[James Wolfe]] (1954), [[Shirlee Emmons]] (1954), and [[Betty Allen]] (1955) among others. French artists in the program included [[Pierre Sancan]] (1951-1952), [[Philippe Entremont]] (1953, 1955), and [[Blanche Tarjus]] (1954) among others. The exchange program expanded in 1953 to include artists from Brazil, beginning with Brazilian pianist [[Oriano de Almeida]] in 1954 and Brazilian soprano [[Edmée Brandi]] in exchange for American soprano Shirlee Emmons (1953) and violinist [[Joyce Flissler]] (1955). The [[Gioventù Musicale d'Italia]] began exchanging artists with the organization in 1955, as did the government of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1955/08/21/archives/world-of-music-cultural-interchange-national-music-league-expanding.html?sq=%2522+National+Music+League%2522&amp;scp=2&amp;st=p|title=WORLD OF MUSIC: CULTURAL INTERCHANGE; National Music League Expanding Its Activities to Include Four Countries|author=[[Ross Parmenter]]|date=August 21, 1955 | work=The New York Times}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to classical architecture:

'''[[Classical architecture]]''' &amp;ndash; architecture of [[classical antiquity]], that is, [[ancient Greek architecture]] and the [[ancient Roman architecture|architecture of ancient Rome]]. It also refers to the style or styles of architecture influenced by those.  For example, most of the styles originating in post-renaissance Europe can be described as classical architecture. This broad use of the term is employed by Sir John Summerson in ''The Classical Language of Architecture''.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== What ''type'' of thing is classical architecture? ==
Classical architecture can be described as all of the following:

* [[Architecture]] &amp;ndash; both the process and product of planning, designing and construction. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural and political symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.
** [[Architectural style]] &amp;ndash; classification of architecture in terms of the use of form, techniques, materials, time period, region and other stylistic influences.
* [[Art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity. The word "art" is therefore both a verb and a noun, as is the term "classical architecture".
** [[Work of art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic physical item or artistic creation.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; as an art form, classical architecture is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Classical architecture is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse.
*** A branch of the [[visual arts]] &amp;ndash; visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, architecture and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.
* Form of [[classicism]] &amp;ndash; high regard in the arts for classical antiquity, as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate.
** [[Classicism#In architecture|Classicism in architecture]] &amp;ndash; places emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts as they are demonstrated in the architecture of Classical antiquity and in particular, the architecture of Ancient Rome, of which many examples remained.

== Classical architectural styles ==
* [[Byzantine architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Romanesque architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Gothic architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Renaissance architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Baroque architecture]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Palladian architecture]] &amp;ndash; European style of architecture derived from the designs of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio (1508–1580). Palladio's work was strongly based on the symmetry, perspective and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the Ancient Greeks and Romans.
* [[Georgian architecture]] &amp;ndash; set of architectural styles current between 1720 and 1840.  In the mainstream of Georgian style were both Palladian architecture— and its whimsical alternatives, Gothic and Chinoiserie, which were the English-speaking world's equivalent of European Rococo.
* [[Neoclassical architecture]] &amp;ndash; architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century, manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament, and in its architectural formulas as an outgrowth of some classicizing features of Late Baroque. In its purest form it is a style principally derived from the architecture of Classical Greece and the architecture of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio.
** [[Empire style]] &amp;ndash; sometimes considered the second phase of Neoclassicism, is an early-19th-century design movement in architecture, furniture, other decorative arts, and the visual arts followed in Europe and America until around 1830, although in the U. S. it continued in popularity in conservative regions outside the major metropolitan centers well past the mid-19th century.
** [[Biedermeier#Architecture during the Biedermeier era|Biedermeier architecture]] &amp;ndash; neoclassical architecture in Central Europe between 1815 and 1848.
** [[Resort architecture]] (''Bäderarchitektur'') &amp;ndash; a specific neoclassical style that came up at the end of the 18th century in German [[seaside resort]]s and is widely used in the region until today.
** [[Federal architecture]] &amp;ndash; classicizing architecture built in the United States between c. 1780 and 1830, and particularly from 1785 to 1815. This style shares its name with its era, the Federal Period.
** [[Regency architecture]] &amp;ndash; buildings built in Britain during the period in the early 19th century when George IV was Prince Regent, and also to later buildings following the same style.

'''Oz Almog''' is an Israeli artist and author who was born on 15 April 1956, in [[Kfar Saba]], Israel.

==Biography==
Oz Almog was born to a family of Russian/Ukrainian pioneers (Avrutzki) and Romanian/Russian immigrants (Abramovich). After studying classical painting and completing his military service in the [[Israeli Navy]], he studied at the [[Vienna Academy of Fine Arts]].

==Work==
Oz Almog's artistic work is confrontational and provocative. In the 1980s, as a student of the Academy of Fine Arts in Austria, Almog took an active part with in off-scene underground culture in Europe. In the 1990s he addressed complex issues of human sexuality, totalitarian ideologies, consumerism and terrorism. In 1994, his ''Birth of a Myth'' (German title ''Geburt eines Mythos'') exhibition took place at WUK, an alternative arts center in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;GEBURT EINES MYTHOS http://bildung-beratung.wuk.at/bildung-beratung/event/id/17009&lt;/ref&gt; The center was converted into a shrine with flags and a flower-strewn floor. In some 70 oil paintings Almog auto-portrayed himself in the style of [[Art of the Third Reich|Nazi art]], classicism and [[Soviet art|social realism]] as a ruler and savior, as a naked, provocatively muscle-bound godlike figure, as a fiery agitator or simply with the stern regard of a [[stormtrooper]], complete with leather belt and [[jackboots]].&lt;ref name="maurer"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Maurer |first1= Thomas |author2= Oz Almog, Thomas Mauer|title= Him too...?? Oz Almog’s Concise Index Judaeorum |chapter= I’m an archivist not a moralist |publisher= Jewish Museum Vienna |year= 2000 | isbn= 978-3-901398-28-5 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almog’s 1995 exhibition ''The Psychonaut and His Mind Navigator'', featured 360 oils, mostly self-portraits in the style of [[Pulp magazine|pulp magazine covers]]. The artist presented himself as a lecherous vampire drooling over a beautiful blond, a revolver-toting gangster, a crazed toy [[Bug-eyed monster|alien]], or monstrously endowed porno star.&lt;ref name="maurer" /&gt; The same year Oz Almog undertook the project ''En Face – Not seen and/or less seen of/by'', reconstructing the images of the famous visual artists by using an original collection of interchangeable facial features' templates of Austrian Federal Police from the 70s.&lt;ref&gt;See exhibition catalog ''En Face'' (1995), publisher ISR, Vienna&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by conceptual exhibitions: ''Blok Brut'' (auto-erotic deaths) and ''Blood Addict - Bloody scenes of Murder 1949-1960'', presented in Janco Dada Museum in Israel in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Almog |first= Oz |title= Blood Addict |publisher= Institute of Strategic Research, Janko Dada Museum |year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Shaheed'' (Suicide Terror phenomena) in Limbus Gallery, Tel Aviv. It is a series of selected real police photos of fatal [[Erotic asphyxiation|auto-erotic strangulations]], extracts from the scene-of-the-crime photos, metamorphosed with real blood into abstract light and dark compositions,&lt;ref name="maurer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Almog |first= Oz |title= Shaheed | publisher= Institute of Strategic Research, Limbus Gallery Tel Aviv |year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Him Too?''===
With his exhibition ''Him too? ... A Chronicle of a Cultural Obsession'', Oz Almog confronts visitors with the question as to what [[Anne Frank]] and [[Jesus]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Fred Astaire]], [[Mr. Spock]] and [[Albert Einstein]], [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[Madeleine Albright]] could possibly have in common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.messis.nl/en/project.html?project=8|title= Die Ook – Oz Almog’s beknopte Index Judaeorum|work=The Messis Foundation |year=2001 |accessdate=3 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In more than 400 small size oil portraits, each accompanied by a short biography, Oz Almog features flamboyant heroes and anti-heroes whose only common denomination is their Jewish origin: names like [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Jack Ruby]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. Showing the opposite to the [[Scientific racism|racist anthropologists]] image of the [[Stereotypes of Jews|Jewish Face]] and underling the diversity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Cahen |first1= Joel |author2= Oz Almog, Joel Cahen|title= Magam hu |trans-title=Him too...??

===2000–2001 exhibitions===
''Aktion T-4: Opera Euthanasia'' – part of the Memorial exhibition at the Upper Austrian State Museum, Linz in the year 2000 – featured a child's bedroom with over 350 paintings of prominent Nazis, serial killers and other criminals and once again produced a massive public reaction. ''Wiener en face – Portraits of Careers'' (Viennese en face – Portraits of Careers), with 350 paintings of prominent Viennese personalities, was shown from October 2000 to April 2001 at the Hermes Villa (part of the Historical Museum of the City of Vienna).&lt;ref name="Hadzivukovic 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hadzivukovic |first1= Vesna |author2= Oz Almog |title= Walls of Sound - Jewish Worlds of Music |chapter= Oz Almog - Biography |publisher= Jewish Museum Vienna |year= 2010 | isbn= 978-3-901398-55-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been followed by ''Towards the Light of Dawn – Jewish Heroes of the Soviet Union'' (Dem Morgenrot Entgegen). With this exhibition Oz Almog has attempted to uncover what he says is the "repressed history" of the 500,000 Jews who fought in the Soviet army – a third of the 1.5 million Jewish soldiers from all Allied nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/10912/ |title= Art exhibit honors Soviet Jews|publisher= Kyiw News |date= 18 April 2002|accessdate= 3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://new-arch.rp.pl/artykul/385567_Co_Zachod_wie_o_Wschodzie_i_na_odwrot.html|title= Co Zachód wie o Wschodzie i na odwrót |author= Grzegorz Sowula |publisher=Rzeczpospolitej |date= 18 May 2002 |accessdate=31 August 2010|language=Polish |trans-title=What the West knows about the East and vice versa }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Kosher Nostra''===
In the exhibition ''Kosher Nostra. Jewish Gangsters in America 1890–1980'', Oz Almog created an impressive documentary summary of an entire epoch of crimes committed by [[Kosher Nostra|Jewish gangsters]]. Through pictures, newspaper articles, and official documents, he showed how such criminals as [[Meyer Lansky]], [[Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel]], and [[Louis Buchalter|Louis "Lepke" Buchalter]] had a determining influence on the development of [[Organized crime|organized crime in America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title= American Jewish Year Book Vol. 104|page= 406|publisher= American Jewish Committee |year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kosher Nostra'', shown in 2004-2005 at the Jewish Museum, Vienna,&lt;ref&gt;Kosher Nostra – History of Jewish Gangsters in America 1890 - 1980 http://www.jmw.at/en/exhibitions/kosher-nostra-history-jewish-gangsters-america-1890-1980&lt;/ref&gt; featured more than 160 realistic oil portraits, with most of personalities shown both full-face and from profile. Each "[[mug shot]]" was accompanied with a short biography, resulting in two books with over 1000 pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austria.gv.at/site/infodate__13.04.2004/4108/default.aspx#id4880|title= Jewish Museum Vienna: no less than three fascinating exhibitions |author= Federal Chancellery Austria |date=13 April 2004|accessdate= 3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/Viena/reconstruye/violenta/historia/mafias/judias/Estados/Unidos/elpepicul/20040113elpepicul_6/Tes

&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004–present===
In 2004 Oz Almog presented his art installation ''Colors of War''. ''Camouflage'' was shown in the [[Imperial Furniture Museum]] in Vienna, exhibiting the original furniture of Austo-Hungarian Emperors, re-furbished with the military camouflage fabrics. ''A Warrior Cult'' was on view at the Jewish Museum&lt;ref&gt;Colors of War. A Warrior Cult http://www.jmw.at/en/exhibitions/colors-war-warrior-cult&lt;/ref&gt; featuring the mosaic of shoulder sleeve insignias oil paintings. 
2007/08 a number of international artists joined Almog in ''Judaica Kid’s Box''  project, taking up the challenge of presenting Jewish tradition, concepts, symbolism, thought and teachings in a form accessible to children. The colorful and entertaining presentation was designed to provide young and "adult" children with the means to understand the significance of the Hebrew alphabet. ''Judaica Kid’s Box'' was running for more than two years in the Jewish Museum, Vienna. At the same time Oz presented an exhibition entitled ''GODDEVILAETHEAR - Oz Almog + Wilhelm Reich: A Journey to Hell'' ("GOTTTEUFELAETHER - Oz Almog + Wilhelm Reich: Ausfluss der Hölle"). Like Wilhelm Reich has a fanatical and often esoterically inspired following, so here we have Oz’s artistic interpretation of the complex plane of [[Wilhelm Reich]]’s concepts in conjunction with a dark, phantasmagorical underworld of Jewish Hell ([[Gehinom]]).&lt;ref name="Hadzivukovic 2010"/&gt;

In 2010 Oz Almog showed in Jewish Museum, Vienna, the exhibition ''Walls of Sound – Jewish Worlds of Music'' featuring Jewish music and Jewish musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Oz Almog ''Walls of Sound - Jewish Worlds of Music'' (Vienna, Judishes Museum der Stadt Wien, 2010) in German/English, {{ISBN|978-3-901398-55-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 2011 Oz Almog released with DJ Shantel the compilation CD ''Kosher Nostra: Jewish Gangsters Greatest Hits'', containing a wild mix of swing, jazz, twist, Charleston and Yiddish songs, the sound of the American Jewish Mafia throughout the '20s to the '60s.&lt;ref&gt;Kosher Nostra: Jewish Gangsters Greatest Hits http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/oz_almog_shantel-kosher_nostra_jewish_gangsters_greatest_hits&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Physician Yutog Yontan Gonpo - Google Art Project.jpg|260px|thumbnail|right|The Physician Yutog Yontan Gonpo]]
'''The Portrait of Yutog Yontan Gonpo''' is a 17th-century [[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[thangka]] of the [[lama]] and the [[physician]] [[Yutog Yontan Gonpo]] (traditionally 708 - 833&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itmonline.org/arts/tibherbs.htm Institute for Traditional Medicine: Tibetan Herbal Medicine] by Subhuti Dharmananda&lt;/ref&gt;) of [[Tibet]], now in the [[Rubin Museum of Art]] in New York. This style of Tibetan thangka painting is called 'tsal thang' with [[gold]] on a [[vermilion]] ground.

The figure of Yutog Yontan Gonpo is often portrayed surrounded by the five buddhas above, the eight Medicine Goddesses at the sides, his special [[yidam]] Black [[Hayagriva]] accompanied by four goddesses below. The protector [[Mahakala]] Shanglon Dorje Dradul typically placed at the bottom center is accompanied by eight fearsome wrathful protector deities with one face and two or four hands, each riding a [[vahana]]. Four of the retinue figures ride atop wild animal or zombie mounts and each of those has nine heads.

The portrait depicts a clean shaven Gonpo as he stretches the right arm forward across the knee in the [[mudra]] of generosity while holding the stem of a pink lotus flower blossoming over the shoulder supporting the [[wisdom book (attribute)|wisdom book]] and [[sword (attribute)|sword]]. The left placed at the heart holds the stem of another lotus, blossoming over the left shoulder, supporting a [[gold]] [[vajra]] and medicinal nectar vase topped with precious [[cintamani|jewels]]. With a headdress of red flower blossoms, he wears a long flowing garment typical of a layman, trimmed with blue and tied with a red sash. He is surrounded by a blue-orange [[halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]] and dark green [[aureola]]. In front, an ornate table supports a large bowl of [[myrobalan]] fruit and precious jewels.

At the top center is the buddha [[Akshobhya]] with one face and two hands holding to the heart with the right a vajra sceptre and with the left a skullcup in the lap. Seated in vajra posture he embraces the consort. At the left is the [[Ratnasambhava]] holding a jewel to the heart and embracing the consort. Below is buddha [[Vairochana]] holding a wheel to the heart. At the right is buddha Amitabha holding a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] flower. Below the buddha [[Amoghasiddhi]] is holding a visva-vajra to the heart surrounded by radiant light.

At the middle right and left are four standing goddesses holding a [[flute]], [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]], [[lute]] and a [[mirror]]. Beautiful in appearance with flowing garments they stand on lotus seats surrounded by light.

At the bottom center is the Medicine Buddha in the form of a wrathful tutelary deity, Black Hayagriva, with one face, and three eyes with a head crowned with a single green [[horse]] head. The right hand holds aloft a curved knife ''([[kartika (knife)|kartika]])'' and in the left a skullcup ''([[kapala]])'' to the heart. On the rear of [[Hayagriva]] two large black wings are unfurled. At the right and left stand four goddesses each with one face and two hands holding aloft in the right a curved knife and a skullcup to the heart with the left, carrying a katvanga staff in the bend of the elbow. Adorned with a tiara of five skulls and various bone ornaments, they each stand on the left leg in a dancing posture surrounded again by radiant light.

'''Rakuten.co.uk''' is a [[website]] owned by [[Rakuten]], that operates as an [[online marketplace]]. The website does not sell any products directly, but instead allows third party sellers to sell their products. The website replaced '''Play.com''', which was originally established in [[Jersey]] as an online retailer of entertainment products including DVDs and music, which subsequently expanded its product offering.

Rakuten purchased Play.com in 2011,&lt;ref name=playbuy&gt;{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Zoe|title=Play.com sold to Rakuten of Japan for £25m|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/21/playcom-sold-rakuten-japan|accessdate=22 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 the company switched to its new marketplace format following a change in the law covering tax for companies operating in Jersey and selling to consumers on the UK mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-20953357|title=Jersey retailer Play.com closes direct retail business|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Play.com website was replaced by Rakuten.co.uk on March 23, 2015.

==History==

===Play.com===
[[File:Rakuten Play.com Logo.png|thumb|Former Play.com logo following its purchase by Rakuten]]
Play.com was founded in 1998 under the name '''Play247.com''', but rebranded as Play.com in 2000. Play.com originally sold region 1 and 2 DVDs only, but since expanded its range to include CDs and [[video game]]s and other electronic items. In 2004 it began to sell books and [[electronics]], in 2006 it started selling [[personal computers]], [[posters]] and [[T-shirt]]s and in 2007 it started selling [[HD DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray]]s, with sister site PlayUSA.com selling region 1 DVDs, HD DVDs and region A [[Blu-ray Disc]]s and offering sales in a range of currencies. The site's interface was redesigned on a number of occasions.

Play.com was ranked second on the November 2006 UK "Hot Shops List" compiled by IMRG and [[Hitwise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hitwise.com/news/uk200611.html "November Hitwise - IMRG Hot Shops List"] - hitwise.com; retrieved 12 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Play.com started selling DRM-free MP3s, clothing, accessories, and [[Ticket (admission)|tickets for events]], allowing customers to buy and sell tickets. They also held a consumer games show which was open to the public, with tickets available through Play.com. This event was backed by [[Sony]], [[Microsoft]], [[Ubisoft]], [[Activision]], and [[THQ]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian Ennis |url=http://www.ripten.com/2008/01/31/playcom-live-first-major-uk-gaming-event/ |title=Play.com Live: First Major UK Gaming Event |publisher=Ripten.com |date=31 January 2008 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2009, a survey published by Verdict Research found Play.com was the UK's second favourite music and video retailer, behind first place Amazon.co.uk and ahead of the now defunct entertainment retailer [[Zavvi (retailer)|Zavvi]] which was third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/74820-amazon-is-uks-third-favourite-retailer.html |title=Amazon is UK's third favourite retailer |publisher=theBookseller.com |accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 February 2009, it was reported that Play.com had topped the National Consumer Satisfaction Index,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3ieda4f2f47125746da816749f5c0f4caa |title=U.K. Consumers Most Satisfied With Play.com |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=24 February 2009 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsiuk.com/index.php |title=Ncsi-Uk |publisher=Ncsi-Uk |date= |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ahead of [[Amazon.co.uk]] and [[iTunes]].

In May 2009, Play.com launched a branded [[Visa Inc.|Visa credit card]] in partnership with [[MBNA]]. Cardholders received points for purchases made on the website and at other retailers. Points could then be redeemed against products bought on the Play.com website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.play.com/Campaign.html?campaign=6748&amp;cid=5106868 |title=Credit Card |publisher=Play.com |date= |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/news.phtml/24223/playcom-offers-credit-card-loyalty-points.phtml |title=Play.com offers credit card |publisher=Pocket-lint.com |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PlayUSA.com website was closed down in February 2011. In September 2011, Japan-based Rakuten purchased Play.com for £25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/news/a341548/playcom-bought-by-japanese-firm-rakuten-for-gbp25m.html |title=Play.com bought by Japanese firm Rakuten for £25m - Media News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 2013, Play.com has operated solely as an online marketplace, where third party retailers sell products with their listings hosted on the website. All retailers on the Marketplace have the ability to build a fully branded and customised storefront, giving them control of how their products are merchandised.

===Replacement with Rakuten===
In October 2014, Rakuten launched Rakuten.co.uk, which replaced Play.com completely on 23 March 2015.

'''Rakuten UK to close'''

On June 7, 2016, Rakuten announced plans for changes in the business in the UK. Rakuten.co.uk in its existing format would no longer be available after the end of August 2016 for new purchases. Rakuten.co.uk was then relaunched in October 2016 as a portal to earn "Superpoints" from using online shops such as Topman, HMV and B&amp;Q.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://link.newsletter.rakuten.co.uk/public/r/yufXLs4Iz0D4hYWhNKfcMQ/mze+19T2aUwm4NRq0+5ZPQ/dNDOVSFzHI1Rsk5dlIFT6A|title=An error has occurred|author=|date=|website=link.newsletter.rakuten.co.uk|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Lawrence Bartholomew''' (1926–1985) was an Indian art critic, photographer, painter, poet, and writer.

==Early life==
Richard Bartholomew fled from [[Tavoy]] (Dawei), Burma ([[Myanmar]]), where he was born, during the [[Second World War]]. To escape the Japanese capture of Burma and the imminent persecution on account of their Christian names, Bartholomew fled with his family, walking the General Stilwell Road from [[Mandalay]] to [[Ledo, Assam|Ledo]] in upper [[Assam]], India.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} His schooling at [[Basic Education High School No. 6 Botataung|St. Paul's School]] in [[Rangoon]] (Yangon) was interrupted because of the Japanese invasion and Bartholomew finished high school at Delhi's Cambridge School.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} He received his bachelor's and master's degree from [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi]] in 1950. While at St. Stephens, he met Rati Batra, his future wife, who was herself a refugee from [[Pakistan]] who came to India during the [[Partition of India|Partition]] in 1947. Bartholomew lived in India as a stateless citizen until 1967 when he gained Indian citizenship, thereby closing all possibilities of returning to Burma which had become a dictatorship from the early–1960s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Photographer, painter, poet==
Bartholomew pursued a career not only as an art critic but also as a writer, poet, painter, and curator.&lt;ref name="Critic's Choice: The Art Critic Richard Bartholomew"&gt;Pankaj Mullick. "Critic's Choice: The Art Critic Richard Bartholomew." ''Hindustan Times'', Delhi, September 23, 2012. [http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/critics-choice/story-EDIvWkFzezZYpgFQv9v3DO.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Solo shows of his work were held in Delhi and Bombay in the 1950s. Between then and the 1970s, he documented life around him through photography. Though he rarely exhibited his photographic work during his lifetime, his pictures intimately portrayed his family and his circle of artist friends and associates and his travels in India and the US.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Art critic and writer==
Bartholomew was a pioneering art critic in that he was one of the first to initiate dialogues with painters. He fostered a sense of community within the artists and communicated their ideals to the public who were not entirely receptive or convinced of the daring, artistic exploration of India's [[Bombay Progressive Artists' Group|Progressive Art Movement]].

Through numerous reviews published from the early–1950s until the late–1970s in publications like ''[[The Indian Express]]'', ''[[The Times of India]]'', and ''Thought'', Bartholomew documented the artistic trajectories of painters such as [[Francis Newton Souza]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], [[Manishi Dey]], Biren De, [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], Krishen Khanna, [[Akbar Padamsee]], [[SH Raza]], [[Sailoz Mookherjea]], [[Bhupen Khakkar]], [[Satish Gujral]]; sculptors like [[Ramkinkar Baij]], Dhanraj Bhagat, Chintamoni Kar, [[Somnath Hore]], [[Sankho Chaudhuri]]; graphic artists including Kanwal Krishna, Devayani Krishna, [[Krishna Reddy (artist)|Krishna Reddy]], [[Jagmohan Chopra]], [[Jyoti Bhatt]] as well as renowned photographers [[Raghu Rai]] and TS Satyan.&lt;ref name="Critic's Choice: The Art Critic Richard Bartholomew"/&gt;

Besides a series of articles on Indian and [[Tibetan art]], Bartholomew also co-authored, [http://openlibrary.org/b/OL7997371M/Husain/ Husain], a monograph on [[M.F. Husain]] which was published by [[Harry Abrams]], New York in 1972. In 1974, he published a monograph on [[Krishna Reddy (artist)|Krishna Reddy]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} He also wrote poems and short stories which were published in magazines including ''Thought'' and ''[[The Illustrated Weekly of India|Illustrated Weekly]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Gallerist and curator==
Bartholomew was the Gallery Director of Kunika-Chemould, New Delhi's first contemporary art gallery. Subsequently, from 1966–1973, he worked with the [http://www.tibethousenewdelhi.org/ Tibet House], New Delhi as their curator and development officer where he catalogued the [[Dalai Lama]]'s collection of religious artefacts and travelled with them to the US and Japan. He was also the recipient of the [[Asian Cultural Council]]'s [[John D. Rockefeller 3rd]] Award in 1970. He was appointed Commissioner of the Silver Jubilee of Indian Independence exhibition held in Washington DC in 1973 and travelled to UK in 1982 as a [[British Council]] Visitor and as Commissioner of the Festival of India Exhibition held in Britain in 1982, during which he co-curated the exhibition ''[[Contemporary Indian Art (Exhibition)|Contemporary Indian Art]]'' at the Royal Academy of Arts with [[Geeta Kapur]] and [[Akbar Padamsee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Indian Art|last=Kapur|first=Geeta|publisher=Indian Advisory Committee, Festival of India, U.K.|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartholomew served as the Secretary of the [[Lalit Kala Akademi]] from 1977 to 1985.

Barely 58, Bartholomew died in 1985. He is survived by his wife Rati Bartholomew and his two sons [[Pablo Bartholomew|Pablo]] and Robin.

[[File:Roadies.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Road crews''' ('''roadies''') working on the stage construction of a concert by ''[[Grace Potter]] and the Nocturnals'' at [[Portsmouth Pavilion|Telos Wireless Pavilion]]&lt;!-- , Portsmouth, Virginia, --&gt; in 2013]]

The '''road crew''' (or '''roadies''') are the [[technician]]s or support personnel who travel with a band on [[concert#Concert tour|tour]], usually in [[sleeper bus]]es, and handle every part of the [[concert production]]s except actually [[performance|performing]] the music with the musicians. This catch-all term covers many people: [[tour manager]]s, [[production management|production managers]], [[stage management|stage managers]], [[audio engineering|front of house and monitor engineers]], lighting directors, [[lighting designers]], [[lighting technician|lighting techs]], [[guitar technician|guitar techs]], [[guitar technician#Bass technician|bass techs]], drum techs, keyboard techs, [[pyrotechnic|pyrotechnicians]], security/[[bodyguard]]s, truck drivers, merchandise crew, and caterers, among others.

==Road crew appearances==
The road crew are generally uncredited, though many bands take care to thank their crew in album sleeve [[liner notes]]. In some cases, roadies have stepped in to help out with playing onstage.
*On June 12, 1993, while performing "[[Bullet in the Head (song)|Bullet in the Head]]" in [[Reykjavik, Iceland]], [[Rage Against the Machine]] guitarist [[Tom Morello]] and bassist [[Tim Commerford]] switched out with their guitar and bass technicians, respectively.
*[[The Doobie Brothers]]' lighting roadie, [[Bobby LaKind]], eventually became a full member of the band. After observing LaKind goofing around on the congas after a concert, the band took notice of his talent and asked him to join as a sideman for studio sessions in 1976.  He became a full member in 1979 and performed as a vocalist, songwriter, percussionist and backup drummer for live shows.
*[[Pink Floyd]] listed theirs on the rear sleeve of ''[[Ummagumma]]'' and recorded them speaking on ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''. A roadie also delivered the spoken part of the studio version of the song "[[Sheep (song)|Sheep]]", on the ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' album. They had also written a song called "[[Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast]]" about a roadie, appearing on their 1970 album ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]''.
* [[Bruce Berry]] was a professional roadie for the members of [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]], both as a group and individually. He died of a heroin overdose on June 4, 1973 and is immortalized in the lyrics of the title track of the album ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' by [[Neil Young]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Bruce Berry was a working man&lt;br/&gt; He used to load that Econoline van...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*[[Pantera]], [[Motörhead]] and [[Godsmack]] even go so far as to feature their crew in their tour videos, and [[Motörhead]] wrote the song "(We Are) The Road Crew" about their crew.
* Exceptionally, in the former [[Manu Chao]] band [[Mano Negra]], the roadies were included as a part of the band when they signed for Virgin.
*[[Todd Rundgren]] and [[Roger Powell (musician)|Roger Powell]] invited roadie Jan Michael Alejandro to play piano with them, [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Bill Wyman]] on a live broadcast of the [[Jerry Lewis Telethon]] in Las Vegas. It was viewed by 33 million people. He also worked the last [[Led Zeppelin]] concert in [[Knebworth 1979]], and he was one of the roadies that [[Jackson Browne]] wrote about on the Running on Empty Tour. Jan owns Jan-Al Cases with his partner Muffie Alejandro.
*[[Jackson Browne]] on his 1977 tour, "Running on Empty", wrote his famous song "[[The Load-Out]]" (usually heard in a live version hybrid with a cover of the [[Maurice Williams (singer)|Maurice Williams]] tune "[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]") in order to honor his roadies.
*[[Perry Bamonte]] was a long-serving guitar tech for [[The Cure]], before filling in on keyboards during the final leg of the Disintegration tour after [[Roger O'Donnell]]'s departure in 1991. He went on to play guitar and keyboards on four Cure albums, including major hit ''[[Wish (The Cure album)|Wish]]''.
* [[Coldplay]]'s video ''[[Life in Technicolor ii]]'' features roadie puppets four times: picking up the cymbal dropped by the drummer, operating the rope that widens the stage, moving a ramp onstage and operating the sound mixer.
* [[Tupac Shakur]] joined [[Digital Underground]] as a roadie, backup singer and dancer in 1990, and appeared with the band in the film [[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|''Nothing but Trouble'']] to begin his rapping career.
* [[U2]]'s "[[One Tree Hill (song)|One Tree Hill]]" on the album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' is dedicated to Greg Carroll, who was a [[stagehand]] in New Zealand. He joined [[The Unforgettable Fire]] tour, and after the tour he stayed in Ireland and became Bono's personal assistant.
* Stuart Morgan, [[Adam Clayton]]'s bass tech, filled in for the U2 bassist for a concert in Sydney in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u2faqs.com/live/#2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021106104804/http://www.u2faqs.com/live/#2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2002-11-06|title=U2: U2faqs.com - Live / Concert FAQ|author=Matt McGee, Aaron Sams|work=u2faqs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[James Hetfield]] of [[Metallica]] has been—at least twice—temporarily replaced in his guitar duties by his roadie John Marshall during his various injuries (such as breaking his arm while skateboarding and after suffering severe burns after standing over a pyrotechnical device).
* [[Tenacious D]] wrote the song Roadie on their 2012 ''[[Rize of the Fenix]]'' album to pay homage to their road crew. A video for the song featured [[Danny McBride]] as a stereotypical, long hair, black leather wearing roadie who grew jealous of the band as he watched their success from the sidelines.

'''Rustin Spencer "Rust" Cohle''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[True Detective (season 1)|first season]] of the [[anthology series|anthology]] [[crime drama]] television series ''[[True Detective]]'' on [[HBO]]. He was created by series creator [[Nic Pizzolatto]] and is portrayed by [[Matthew McConaughey]]. Cohle works as a detective for the Louisiana State Homicide Unit, alongside his partner Martin "Marty" Hart ([[Woody Harrelson]]). The season follows Cohle and Hart's hunt for a [[serial killer]] in Louisiana, across 17 years.

Both the character of Rust Cohle and Matthew McConaughey's performance have received critical acclaim. McConaughey won the [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series]], and was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alice|last=Vincent|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10677470/True-Detective-Matthew-McConaughey-wrote-a-450-page-deconstruction-of-Rust-Cohles-life.html|title=''True Detective'': Matthew McConaughey wrote a 450-page deconstruction of Rust Cohle's life|work= ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|location=London, England|date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character overview==
Cohle is introduced as a gifted, but deeply troubled, detective from [[Texas]] who is transferred from working on regional drug task force to the [[Louisiana]] State Police near the end of 1994. After three months with the LSP, in January 1995, he and his partner are tasked with investigating a series of brutal, bizarre murders. A haunted, solitary [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], Cohle believes that life is meaningless, human beings are merely "sentient meat", and hope is self-delusion.&lt;ref name="The Long Bright Dark"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Long Bright Dark|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep1|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= January 12, 2014|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohle spends his free time obsessing over every detail of the crime, hoarding evidence in a storage locker and keeping extensive notes in a ledger, which earns him the derisive nickname "The Taxman" among his colleagues.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Seeing Things|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep2|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= January 19, 2014|season=1|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series gradually reveals Cohle's backstory. He was born in [[South Texas]] but raised in [[Alaska]] by his father after his parents divorced. He became a police detective in his 20s. Years before the main story arc, his two-year-old daughter, Sophia, was killed in a car accident, a tragedy that destroyed his marriage. Devastated by the loss, Cohle grew ever more unstable and unpredictable in his work, eventually killing a [[crystal meth]] addict who had injected his own child with the drug. His superiors offered him a chance to avoid prison by working as an undercover narcotics detective, which he did for four years; Cohle notes that this was twice as long as most undercover detectives are kept in rotation. During this assignment, Cohle became addicted to drugs, and eventually killed three cartel members in a shootout, while being shot multiple times himself.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things"/&gt;

During his recovery, he was committed to a mental hospital in [[Lubbock, Texas]]. Upon his release, he was offered retirement with full pension, but he declined that offer in favor of transferring to a homicide division. His superiors then transferred him to Louisiana. In Louisiana, he lives alone and has no friends, living only for his work. He tries to remain sober, but he occasionally falls off the wagon because of the stress of his job and his grief for his daughter. Cohle also has [[synesthesia]] and suffers from [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] from his drug-using years as an undercover cop.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things" /&gt;

The series takes place in two time periods: 1995–2002, in which Cohle and Hart work together to find the killer; and 2012, when Cohle, who has by now quit the police force and become an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], submits to an interview with Louisiana State Police Department detectives Maynard Gilbough ([[Michael Potts (actor)|Michael Potts]]) and Thomas Papania ([[Tory Kittles]]) regarding the murders. Cohle sees through the detectives, and realizes that they think he is the killer.&lt;ref name="The Locked Room"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Locked Room|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep3|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate=January 26, 2014|season=1|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character arc==
Cohle and Hart are assigned to investigate a murder in which the killer [[rape]]d and [[torture]]d the victim, Dora Lange, and attached a pair of antlers to her head after killing her.&lt;ref name="The Long Bright Dark" /&gt; They find Lange's diary, which contains repeated references to "[[Carcosa]]" and a "Yellow King". In the wreckage of a burnt-out church Lange attended, they find a wall painting depicting a human figure wearing deer antlers.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things" /&gt;

Cohle and Hart work the case for three months, during which they trace the murder to Reggie Ledoux ([[Charles Halford]]), a former cellmate of Lange's ex-husband.&lt;ref name="The Locked Room" /&gt; To find more information, Cohle infiltrates a biker gang with ties to Ledoux, posing as a drug dealer representing a cartel in Mexico. He assists the gang in a home invasion so he can arrest the ringleader, Ginger ([[Joseph Sikora]]), and force him to lead them to Ledoux, who cooks meth for the biker gang. During the home invasion, a shootout ensues in which several people are killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Who Goes There|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep4|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate=February 9, 2014|season=1|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginger takes Cohle to meet Ledoux's cousin and "cook partner", Dewall ([[Ólafur Darri Ólafsson]]). The meeting does not go well, but Hart follows Dewall to Ledoux's [[meth lab]] and calls Cohle to tell him where it is. There, Hart and Cohle discover that Ledoux has kidnapped and tortured two children, and Hart kills Ledoux in a fit of rage as Cohle looks on. Dewall, meanwhile, is killed after he runs off and blows up on one of his own homemade mines. Cohle stages evidence to support Hart's story that Ledoux opened fire on them, forcing Hart to kill him in self-defense. The two are hailed as heroes, and receive commendations and promotions.&lt;ref name="The Secret Fate of All Life"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Secret Fate of All Life|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep5|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= February 16, 2014|season=1|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Cohle interrogates a suspect who reveals that Ledoux and Dewall did not act alone.&lt;ref name="The Secret Fate of All Life" /&gt; He tells Cohle that he will give them information about the "Yellow King" in return for a plea deal. Cohle wants to investigate this lead further, but the suspect kills himself in his cell that night, after receiving a phone call. Cohle becomes obsessed with reopening the case, and pursues several leads, including a private Christian school run by Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle ([[Jay O. Sanders]]) that had been closed amid rumors of [[child molestation]]. Tuttle complains to Cohle's superiors, who suspend Cohle without pay and order him to leave the case closed. That night, Hart's wife Maggie ([[Michelle Monaghan]]) shows up at Cohle's apartment and seduces him in order to get back at Hart for repeatedly cheating on her. Hart finds out and gets into a fistfight with Cohle in front of the entire department. Cohle quits the force the same day, and becomes a drifter and an alcoholic, supporting himself as a part-time bartender.&lt;ref name="Haunted Houses"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Haunted Houses|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep6|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= February 23, 2014|season=1|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rust Cohle 2012.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cohle in 2012]]
In 2012, murders similar to those from 1995 begin again, Cohle is seen in the vicinity of the body, arousing the suspicion of Louisiana State Police Department detectives Maynard Gilbough and Thomas Papania. They believe that Cohle was the killer in 1995, because he led Hart to every lead they had and seemed to know everything about the killer's frame of mind. Gilbough and Papania now believe that Cohle is committing the new murders as well. They interview Cohle and Hart, who both refuse to cooperate once the purpose of the interview becomes clear.&lt;ref name="Haunted Houses" /&gt;

Cohle meets with Hart and tells him that he has found evidence leading to the killer. Hart is skeptical, and still resentful of Cohle for having sex with Maggie, but Cohle convinces him to help with the investigation by showing him a videotape he stole from Rev. Tuttle's home. The video is over 20 years old, and shows numerous masked men raping and torturing Marie Fontenot, a missing child whose name had come up in their investigation 17 years earlier. Cohle and Hart track down the original case's chief investigating officer, Steve Geraci ([[Michael Harney]]), and interrogate him at gunpoint. Geraci tells them that his superior, the late Sheriff Ted Childress, ordered him to halt the investigation; Childress was one of Tuttle's relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=After You've Gone|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep7|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate=March 2, 2014|season=1|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They soon discover that the Tuttle and Childress families — to whom both Reggie and Dewall Ledoux belong — are related, and have long histories of child abuse and murder. They ultimately discover that the killer is a Childress, and go to the late sheriff's home to investigate.&lt;ref name="Form and Void"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Form and Void|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep8|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= March 9, 2014|season=1|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohle and Hart go to the Childress house, where they find that the sheriff's son, Errol ([[Glenn Fleshler]]), is the killer, and discover the remains of his father tied up in a shed. They also encounter Betty Childress ([[Ann Dowd]]), his mentally disabled half-sister, with whom he is having an [[incest]]uous relationship. Cohle pursues Childress into the catacombs behind the house, which Childress identifies as Carcosa. Cohle discovers an idol draped in yellow and covered in skulls — the "Yellow King" — and has a hallucination of a spiraling vortex, the same vortex that had been drawn on many of the victims over the past 17 years. Childress stabs Cohle in the gut and also attacks Hart, but Cohle saves his partner by shooting Childress in the head, killing him. Gilborough and Papania, whom Hart had called, arrive at the scene. With the evidence Hart and Cohle collected, they connect Childress to dozens of murders, including Dora Lange's.&lt;ref name="Form and Void" /&gt;

Cohle falls into a coma, during which he feels the loving presence of his father and daughter. He later wakes up in hospital and leaves with Hart, and tells him that, "Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light's winning."&lt;ref name="Form and Void" /&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
McConaughey received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Cohle, and has won and been nominated for several awards,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000190/awards Matthew McConaughey - Awards] www.imdb.com.&lt;/ref&gt; including:

'''Samuel Howitt''' (1756/57&amp;ndash;1822)&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Cohen, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101013997/ ''Howitt, Samuel  (1756/7–1823)''] (ODNB - 26 July 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; was an English painter, illustrator and [[etcher]] of animals, hunting, horse-racing and landscape scenes. He worked in both [[oil painting|oils]] and [[watercolors]].

==Life and work==
[[File:Taking wild horses on the plains of Moldavia.jpg|thumb|Taking wild horses on the plains of Moldavia (wood engraving after Howitt))]]
[[File:Huntsmen opening gates to release dogs to chase after fowl. Wellcome V0021912.jpg|thumb|Pheasant hawking, 1799]]
Howitt was a member of an old [[Nottinghamshire]] [[Quaker]] family. In early life he lived at [[Chigwell]], near [[Epping Forest]], [[Essex]], was financially independent and devoted himself to [[field sports]]. However he ran into financial difficulties and was obliged to turn to art as a profession - which up until then he had engaged in as a talented amateur.

Coming to [[London]], he was for a time a drawing master at [[Samuel Goodenough]]'s school in [[Ealing]]. In 1783, he exhibited 3 coloured drawings of hunting subjects with the [[Incorporated Society of Artists]]. From time to time he continued to exhibit there and at the [[Royal Academy]], beginning in 1784 with a hunting piece, followed in 1785 by two landscapes - "A view of the ruins of an abbey" and "Fairlop Oak".  In 1793 he showed "Jaques and the Deer" and "A Fox Hunt"; in 1794, "Smugglers alarmed"; in 1800, two  pictures titled "Deer"; in 1814 "Dead game"; and in 1815, "Bella, horrida Bella".&lt;ref&gt;Gilbey, Sir Walter. ''Animal painters of England from the year 1650'' (London : Vinton &amp; Co., 1900), [https://archive.org/details/animalpaintersof02gilb volume 2, pp.36–46]&lt;/ref&gt; He probably exhibited so little because he was in such demand as a commercial illustrator.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbey p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

Howitt worked both in oils and water-colours, for the most part confining himself to sporting subjects and illustrations of natural history, which were carefully executed, spirited and truthful. These, as Howitt represented in his ''New Work of Animals'', were “drawn from the life" and published so as to "assist the pencil of the designer who has not had an opportunity to pay the same attention to this branch of the art”. However, notes in one sketchbook containing watercolours of apes and monkeys indicate that, while some there certainly were viewed in private menageries, others were studies of stuffed specimens from [[William Bullock (collector)|William Bullock]]’s museum and the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Diana Donald, ''Picturing Animals in Britain, 1750-1850'', Yale University 2007, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WeaZhKkL9YwC&amp;lpg=PA204&amp;ots=VN8WRaSt3-&amp;dq=samuel%20howitt%20%20editions%20of%20A%20New%20Work%20of%20Animals&amp;pg=PA340#v=onepage&amp;q=samuel%20howitt%20%20editions%20of%20A%20New%20Work%20of%20Animals&amp;f=false p.340, note 65]&lt;/ref&gt;

Howitt was closely associated in his art with [[Thomas Rowlandson]], whose sister he married, and his works did, at one time, often pass for those of his brother-in-law; but, unlike Rowlandson, he was a practical sportsman, and his scenes were more accurately composed. He was a clever and industrious etcher, and published a great number of plates similar in character to his drawings, and delicately executed with a fine needle. He also produced a number of caricatures in the manner of Rowlandson.

Howitt was particularly noted for the illustrations in (Captain) Thomas Williamson's ''Oriental Field Sports'' (1807), based on sketches made by the author in India .&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Williamson and S. Howitt, [https://archive.org/details/illustrationsin00howigoog ''Illustrations of Indian Field Sports''], (A. Constable, 1892)&lt;/ref&gt; He also illustrated several other works: ''Thoughts on Hunting'' (London: D. Bremner, 1798),&lt;ref&gt;Gilbey, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Other publications included ''Miscellaneous Etchings of Animals'' (50 plates, 1803); ''British Field Sports'' (20 coloured plates, 1807); ''The Angler's Manual'' (12 plates, 1808); ''A New Work of Animals'' (100 plates, 1811); ''Groups of Animals'' (24 plates, 1811); ''The British Sportsman'' (70 plates, 1812); ''Foreign Field Sports'' (110 plates, 1819).

In 1822 Howitt died in [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]], London, and was buried in [[St Pancras, London|St. Pancras]] cemetery.

==A new work of animals==
Some idea of Howitt’s ingenuity and commercial resourcefulness can be gained from considering his compilation of ''A New Work of Animals'', a series of copper engravings in quarto format “principally designed from the fables of Aesop, Gay and Phaedrus”. The idea of an album of animal portraits is presented in a prefatory note as a new venture  that “strange as it may appear, has never before been done by any British artist”. Howitt “has preferred representing most of the animals in fables, as allowing more scope for delineating the expression, the character and the passions,” and he hopes that, by being "studious to attain correctness, he may deserve the approbation of the natural historian" and instruct fellow painters. This will explain why, out of a hundred plates, only 56 illustrate fables, the rest being of animal or hunting subjects.

[[File:Peacock Chosen King.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2||The fable of "The Peacock Chosen King", a tinted plate from ''A New Work of Animals'']]
For the text of the fables, Howitt had extracted those of [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop]] (and Phaedrus) from the prose collection of [[Samuel Croxall]], including his lengthy moralising "applications". [[John Gay]]'s fables are in rhyme and only account for 27 pages out of 106 of text. Separate plates were bound in sideways opposite the title, followed by one of the supplementary illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;These directions to the binder appear on [https://books.google.com/books?id=19Q9AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.13]&lt;/ref&gt; However, beneath the title of each plate there is an inscription indicating that some of these were designed in the years 1809-10, antedating the publication of the book itself in 1811 and suggesting that they were sold separately at that date, and probably afterwards too. Since fables carried a moral, they had wider popular appeal than elitist sporting subjects and could be mounted on walls for the edification of whoever saw them. Such plates were available in both black and white and in tinted versions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heatons-of-tisbury.co.uk/Sporting8.html Online examples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416154204/http://www.heatons-of-tisbury.co.uk/Sporting8.html |date=2015-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Howitt also created watercolours from the designs that were sold with the moral printed round the card mount.&lt;ref&gt;An [http://grahamarader.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/offering-of-day-superb-original.html online example]&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, from a single work the artist was able to extract three sources of income.

A second edition of the whole book was published in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/new-work-of-animals-principally-designed-from-the-fables-of-sop-gay-and-phdrus-containing-one-hundred-plates/oclc/3703421/editions?referer=di&amp;editionsView=true World Cat]&lt;/ref&gt; Howitt's plates were also to be republished after his death. Further evidence of the esteem in which his work continued to be held was the use made of six illustrations as the basis of the [[Mintons]], Hollins set of Aesop's Fables tiles, first issued in 1870, sixty years later. These included “[[The Tortoise and the Hare]]”, “[[The Cock, the Dog and the Fox]]”, “The Sick Stag”, “The Boar and the Fox”, “[[The Bear and the Travellers]]” and “[[The Bear and the Bees]]”.

'''Social impact entertainment''' ('''SIE''') is a variety of mainstream entertainment, predominately films and TV, that intends to have social impact next to great entertainment value.

The practitioners in this field are predominately producers and directors who want to add a "social surplus" to their entertainment, as contrasted to the field of [[Entertainment-education]] which often starts out with a social change directive and then creates the entertainment around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediaimpact.org/entertainment-education/|title=Entertainment-Education|date=2012-10-24|work=PCI Media Impact|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A focus in the field is the study of actual effects (social impact measurement), while the predominant interest is still to create entertaining, profitable content and work within the ecosystem of commercial film production and distribution. A common theme in the field of SIE is that mainstream film production companies employ so-called "[[Impact producer|Impact Producers]]" who specialize in impact-oriented distribution campaigns which can often include community screenings, screenings for legislators as well as impact measurement and evidence-building.

[[Cinema of Change]] reports on progress in the Social Impact Entertainment world. Currently, there are approximately 130 organizations, companies and film festivals operating in the ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinemaofchange.com/the-cinema-of-change-ecosystem/|title=The Cinema of Change EcosystemThe Cinema of Change Ecosystem - Cinema of Change|website=www.cinemaofchange.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most notable being [[Participant Media]] due to its $100 million+ funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jmkdbrhlfK8C&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Tech Billionaires: Reshaping Philanthropy in a Quest for a Better World|last=Solomon|first=Lewis D.|date=2011-12-31|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412813747|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social impact entertainment is taught at a few universities and has taken foot with a handful of institutes, most notably [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Norman Lear Center]] and [[UCLA TFT]]'s Skoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11491">The discourses in philosophy regarding [[social relation]]. What [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] call "the principle of '''superficiality''' versus depth"&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (2007) p. 18-9&lt;/ref&gt; has pervaded [[Western culture]] since at least the time of [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Lacan]], ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 1994) p. 71 and p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical sketch==

[[Socrates]] sought to convince his debaters to turn from the superficiality of a worldview based on the acceptance of convention to the examined life of philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn A. Morgan, ''Myth and Philosophy from the pre-Socratics to Plato'' (2000) p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; founded (as [[Plato]] at least considered) upon the underlying [[Theory of Forms|Ideas]]. For more than two millennia, there was in the Platonic wake a general valorisation of critical thought over the superficial subjectivity that refused deep analysis.&lt;ref&gt;M. R. Gladstein/C. M. Sicabarra, ''Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand'' (1999) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The salon style of the [[Précieuses]] might for a time affect superficiality, and play with the possibility of treating serious topics in a light-hearted fashion;&lt;ref&gt;A. De Riencout, ''Sex and Power in History'' (1974) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; but the prevailing western consensus firmly rejected elements such as everyday chatter&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Cusset, ''No Tomorrow'' (1996) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; or the changing vagaries of fashion&lt;ref&gt;G. D. McCracken, ''Transformations'' (2008) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; as superficial distractions from a deeper reality.

==Modernist cross-currents==

By contrast, [[Nietzsche]] opened the modernist era with a self-conscious praise of superficiality: "What is required is to stop courageously at the surface, the fold, the skin, to adore appearance, to believe in forms, tones, words, in the whole Olympus of appearance! Those Greeks were superficial – ''out of profundity''!".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory Castle, ''The Blackwell Guide to Theory'' (OxfordLiteraryironic 2007) p.&lt;/ref&gt;

His (still) preference for superficiality was however over-shadowed for most of the 20th century by [[modernism]]'s full subscription to the depth/surface model, and to the privileging of the former over the latter. [[Frederic Jameson]] has highlighted four main modernist versions of the belief in a ''deeper'' reality - Marxist, psychoanalytic, existential, and semiotic -  in each of which reality is understood to be concealed behind an inauthentic surface or façade.&lt;ref&gt;A. Bennett/N. Royle, ''An Introduction to Literature, Criticism and Theory'' (2004) p. 253-4&lt;/ref&gt; Jameson contrast these models sharply with the lack of depth, the ahistoricity, the surface-focus and flatness of the postmodern consciousness, with its new [[cult]] of the image and the [[simulacrum]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 17 and p 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodernism==

In the last third of the 20th century, [[Lyotard]] began challenging the Platonic view of a true meaning hidden behind surface as a ''theatrical'' world-view, insisting instead that sense manifestations had their own reality which necessarily impacted upon the purely verbal order of intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;K. Chrome/J. Williams ed., ''The Lyotard Reader and Guide'' (2006) p. 24-8&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[deconstruction]] has increasingly sought to undo the depth/surface hierarchy, proposing in ironic style that superficiality is as deep as depth.&lt;ref&gt;Cusset, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The result has been the call to abandon the idea that behind appearances there is any ultimate truth to be found;&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 135-6&lt;/ref&gt; and in consequence the growing postmodern replacement of depth by surface, or by multiple surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Fredric Jameson, ''Postmodernism'' (London 1991) p. 2 and p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

That process of substitution was well under way by the 1990s, when notoriously "surface was depth",&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bracewell, ''The Nineties: when surface was depth'' (London 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the new millennium has led to a state of what has been called hypervisibility: everything is on view.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Toffoletti, ''Baudrillard Reframed'' (London 2011) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In this new era of exposure&lt;ref&gt;L. Magid/A. Collier, ''Myspace'' (2007) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; we are all submerged in what the psychoanalyst Michael Parsons has called "the totalist world where there is a horror of inwardness; everything must be revealed".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

If postmodernism's proponents welcomed the way a new transcendence of the surface /depth dichotomy allowed a fuller appreciation of the possibilities of the superficial&lt;ref&gt;Russell De Manning, ''Theology at the End of Culture'' (2005) p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; - the surface consciousness of the now, as opposed to the depths of historical time&lt;ref&gt;E. D. Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (Princeton 1992) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; - critics like [[J. G. Ballard]] object that the end-product is a world of "laws without penalties, events without significance, a sun without shadows":&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Ballard, ''Millennium People'' (London 2003) p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; of surface without depth. They see postmodern superficiality as a by-product of the [[false consciousness]] of global capitalism, where surface distractions, news, and entertainment supersaturate the [[zapping]] mind in such a way as to foreclose the possibility of envisioning any critical alternative.&lt;ref&gt;David Edwards, ''Burning All Illusions'' (1996) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapy==

Almost all [[Depth psychology|depth psychologies]] defy the postmodern to value depth over surface - to aim, in [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]]'s words, for "change from the depths of oneself upwards into the ''superficies'' of one's social appearance".&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (Penguin 1974) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Debates may rage over whether to ''begin'' analysis at the surface or by way of  deep interpretations,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1997) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; but this is essentially a question of timing. Thus for example [[Jung]]ians would highlight at the start of therapy what they call the ''[[Persona (psychology)|persona-restoring]]'' phase as an effort to preserve superficiality, but would later optimally see the client moving from the surface to deeper emotion and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;David Sedgwick, ''Introduction to Jungian Psychotherapy'' (2006) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fritz Perls]] by contrast maintained that "the simplicity of the [[Gestalt therapy|Gestalt]] approach is that we pay attention to the obvious, to the utmost surface. We don't delve into a region which we don't know anything about, into the so-called 'unconscious{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Perls, ''Gestalt Therapy Verbatim'' (1972) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; A similar focus on the superficial has fuelled much of the [[Freud Wars]] of [[late modernity]], in which, according to [[Jonathan Lear]], "the real object of attack - for which Freud is only a stalking-horse - is the very idea that humans have unconscious motivation".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lear, in Parsons, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Given a choice of surface or depth—"are we to see humans as having depth, layers of meaning which lie beneath the surface of their own understanding?"—he asks: "Or are we to take ourselves as transparent to ourselves...to ignore the complexity, depth and darkness of human life";&lt;ref&gt;Lear, in Parsons, p. 24-5&lt;/ref&gt; the postmodern bias remains towards superficiality.

==Social processing==

[[Social psychology]] considers that in everyday life social processing veers between superficiality, where we rely on [[First impression (psychology)|first impressions]] and immediate judgements, and a deeper form of processing in which we seek to understand the other person more fully.&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 18 and p. 92-3&lt;/ref&gt; In the ordinary course of life, we necessarily take others at face-value,&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade''  (London 1972) p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; and use [[ideal type]]s/[[stereotypes]] to guide our daily activities; while institutions too can rely on the superficial consensus of [[groupthink]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; to preclude deeper investigation.

Some circumstances however necessitate a shift from superficial to extensive processing. When things become serious, we must put more and deeper thought into understanding, leaving superficial judgements to cases where the stakes are low, not high.&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 554&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
* Entertainer [[Bill Hicks]] often criticized [[consumerism]], superficiality, mediocrity, and banality within the media and [[popular culture]], describing them as oppressive tools of the ruling class, meant to "keep people stupid and apathetic."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8409129199157823217 "Bill Hicks on Austin Public Access"], October 24, 1993, via Vide.Google.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Web 2.0#Criticism|Web 2.0]] in particular is often seen as specifically fostering superficiality, replacing deep, measured analysis by noisy but unfiltered observation.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Keen, ''The Cult of the Amateur'' (2008) p. 16 and p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley's]] novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' is his examination of American culture, particularly what he saw as its [[narcissism]], superficiality, and obsession with youth. [[Freud]] had similarly explored what was at the start of the 20th century a conventional contrast between the (historical) depth of Europe and the superficiality of America;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; but towards the century's close, another European, [[Baudrillard]], would return to the image of America as a shallow, cultureless desert, only to praise it in postmodern terms "because you are delivered from all depths there – a brilliant, mobile, superficial neutrality".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Stuart Sim ed., ''The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism'' (London 2001) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' has been analysed in terms of the movement from the superficiality of [[Elizabeth Bennet]]'s initially favourable appraisal of Whickham – her first impressions – to her deeper realisation of the value of Mr Darcy.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Tanner, 'Introduction', Jane Austen, ''Pride and Prejudice'' (Penguin 1972) p. 11-24&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Falcon''' is a [[public house]] in [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England. It stands on the west side of Lower Bridge Street at its junction with Grosvenor Road.  The Falcon is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376292|desc= Falcon Inn, Chester|accessdate= 11 April 2015|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building formerly incorporated part of [[Chester Rows]], but it was the first building to have its portion of the row enclosed in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century.

==History==

The building originated as a house in about 1200 and was later extended to the south along Lower Bridge Street, with a great hall running parallel to the street.  During the 13th&amp;nbsp;century it was rebuilt to incorporate its portion of the row.  It was rebuilt again during the late 16th and early 17th&amp;nbsp;centuries.  The house was bought in 1602 by [[Sir Richard Grosvenor, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Grosvenor]] who extensively altered it some 40 years later to make it his [[Townhouse|town house]].  During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] he moved his family here from his country home, [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]].  In 1643 Sir Richard petitioned the City Assembly for leave to enlarge his house by enclosing the portion of the row which passed through his property. This was successful and it set a precedent for other residents of Lower Bridge Street to enclose their portion of the rows, or to build new structures which did not incorporate the rows.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_location.php?id=19 | title = The Falcon | accessdate = 17 July 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Falcon inn, Chester.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Falcon'', by [[Edward Harrison Compton]], before 1916]]
The east face of The Falcon is on Lower Bridge Street and the north face on Grosvenor Road.  The east face has two storeys on a [[sandstone]] plinth with two [[gable]]s.  Most of the sandstone is [[Stucco|rendered]].  To the left is a staircase of nine steps leading from the street to the lower storey, which is the level of the enclosed row.  The lower storey has [[Close studding|close timber studding]] and an eleven-light leaded window.  Above this is a row of twelve [[quatrefoil]] panels which slope slightly outwards over which is a continuous 34-light leaded window.  The two gables are carried on brackets which curve outwards, and have herringbone [[strut]]s, [[Molding (decorative)|moulded]] [[bargeboard]]s and shaped [[finial]]s.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

The north face give the appearance of two buildings.  The older part is to the left (east) and the newer right (west) part was possibly added by Sir Richard Grosvenor in 1626.  The eastern portion is a continuation of the east front.  The street level and the lower storey are in sandstone, partly rendered, some of which has been replaced by brick.  The upper storey has a window of six lights, which are continuous with those on the east face and two quatrefoils above.  To the right of these is timber framing and a window.  Above is a grey slate roof and a lateral shaped chimney in brick.  The western portion has a rendered [[plinth]] with timber framing above.  On the lower storey is a door and two windows, one with seven lights and the other with four.  The upper storey has similar windows, plus a one-light window over the door.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

===Interior===
The medieval undercroft is used as the beer cellar.  It was originally a single three-bay chamber but has been divided by a [[Brick|brick wall]] into a two-bay north chamber and a single-bay south chamber.  In the cellar are two octagonal stone [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and a massive central east-west oak beam.  On the level of the row is a room along the east side, which is the enclosed portion of the row, and two rooms behind, with a further room in the west wing.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

'''''The Magdalene Sisters''''' is a 2002 [[Cinema of Ireland|Irish]]-[[Cinema of United Kingdom|British]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Peter Mullan]], about three teenage girls who were sent to [[Magdalene Asylum]]s (also known as 'Magdalene Laundries') homes for women who were labelled as "fallen" by their families or society. The homes were maintained by individual religious orders in the [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland]].

Peter Mullan has remarked that the film was initially made because victims of Magdalene Asylums had received no closure in the form of recognition, compensation or apology, and many remained lifelong devout Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Interview with Peter Mullan |url=http://www.themoviechicks.com/summer2003/mctmagdalene.html |quote=It was initially because it was unfinished.

So initially, it was as a means to get their story in the public domain.|publisher=[[Movie Chicks]] |date= |accessdate=7 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Magdalene inmate Mary-Jo McDonagh told Mullan that the reality of the Magdalene Asylums was much worse than depicted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Fiachra|last= Gibbons|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=

I don't like to say it, but the film is soft on the nuns," says McDonagh, who spent five years in one in Galway after being molested by a neighbour. She was spirited away early one morning by a priest and told she had "brought shame on her family". |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date= 7 February 2003 |accessdate=7 March 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though set in [[Ireland]], it was shot entirely on location in [[Dumfries and Galloway]], South-West Scotland.

==Plot==
Set in Ireland, beginning in 1964, so-called "fallen" women were considered sinners who needed to be redeemed. The film follows the stories of four young women - Margaret (raped by her cousin), Bernadette (too beautiful and coquettish), Rose (an unmarried mother) and Crispina (an intellectually disabled unmarried mother) - who are all forced by their families or caretakers into the Magdalene Asylum.
The film details the disastrous lives of the four girls whilst they are inmates, portraying their harsh daily regimen and their squalid living conditions put on at the laundries.

Each woman suffers unspeakable cruelty and violence from the Mother Superior, Sister Bridget, despite her gentle-faced appearance and outwardly soft-spoken demeanour. She is characterised as sadistic and almost inhuman at times, as conveyed through her merciless beating of Rose in full view of Bernadette, or when she mockingly laughs at Una as she hopelessly clutches at her fallen hair locks.

The film also criticises the hypocrisy and corruption within the staff of the laundries. Sister Bridget relishes the money the business receives and it is suggested that little of it is distributed appropriately. Those who liken themselves to [[Mary Magdalene]], who deprived herself of all pleasures of the flesh including food and drink, eat hearty breakfasts of buttered toast and bacon while the working women subsist on oatmeal. In one particularly humiliating scene, the women are forced to stand naked in a line after taking a communal shower. The nuns then hold a "contest" on who has the most pubic hair, biggest bottom, biggest breasts and smallest breasts. The corruption of the resident priest, Father Fitzroy, is made very clear through his sexual abuse of Crispina. However, as the years pass, automatic [[washing machine]]s start to appear, a modern [[household appliance]] whose growing ubiquity would eventually fatally undermine the economic viability of commercial laundries and make the Magdalene Asylums unsustainable.

Three of the girls are shown, to some extent, to triumph over their situation and their captors. Margaret, although she is allowed to leave by the intervention of her younger brother, does not leave the asylum without leaving her mark. When she deliberately asks Sister Bridget to step aside for her to freely pass and is sharply shot down, Margaret falls to her knees in prayer. The Mother Superior is so surprised, she only moves past her after the Bishop tells her to come along. Bernadette and Rose finally decide to escape together, trashing Sister Bridget's study in search for the key to the asylum door and engaging her in a suspenseful confrontation. The two girls escape her clutches and are helped to return to the real world by a sympathetic relative, their story optimistically ending when Rose boards a coach bound for the ferry to [[Liverpool]] and Bernadette becomes an apprentice hairdresser. Crispina's end, however, is not a happy one; she spends the rest of her days in a mental institution (where she was sent to silence her from revealing the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of Father Fitzroy) and dies of [[anorexia]] at age 24. Her real name was also revealed to be Harriet.

The epilogue to the film gives a brief description of the lives of four of the inmates after the girls leave the asylum by the late 1960s. It is noted that the last Magdalene asylum closed in 1996.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32231">'''The semantic turn''' refers to a [[paradigm shift]] in the design of artifacts – [[industrial design|industrial]], [[Graphic Design|graphic]], [[Information Design|informational]], [[Architectural Design|architectural]], and [[Social design|social]] – from an emphasis on how artifacts ought to function to what they mean to those affected by them – [[semantics]] being a concern for meaning. It provides a new foundation for professional design, a detailed design discourse, codifications of proven methods, compelling scientific justifications of its products, and a clear identity for professional designers working within a network of their [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].

The semantic turn suggests a distinction between the technical and user-irrelevant working of artifacts and the human interactions with artifacts, individually, socially, and culturally. Attending to the technical dimension of artifacts, for example, by applied scientists, mechanical or electronic engineers, and experts in economics, production, and marketing, is called technology-centered design. It addresses its subject matter in terms that ordinary users may not understand and applies design criteria users of technology do not care about. Attending to the meanings that users bring to their artifacts, how they use them and talk about them and among various stakeholders, is the domain of human-centered design. For ordinary users, the makeup and technical functioning of artifacts is mere background of what really matters to them.

A prime example for this distinction is the design of [[Human-centered computing|personal computers]]. For most people, the operations inside a computer are incomprehensible, but far from troubling because computers are designed to be experienced primarily through their interfaces. [[User interface|Human-computer interfaces]] consist of interactively rearrangeable icons, texts, and controls that users can understand in everyday terms and manipulate towards desirable ends. The design of intelligent artifacts suggests that the old adage of “form follows function” is no longer valid&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff, Klaus &amp; Butter, Reinhart (1993). Where Meanings Escape Functions. ''Design Management Journal 4'', 2, pp. 30–37.&lt;/ref&gt; – except for the simplest of tools. The semantic turn suggests that human-centered designers’ unique expertise resides in the design of human interfaces with artifacts that are meaningful, easy to use, even enjoyable to experience, be it simple kitchen implements, public service systems, architectural spaces, or information campaigns. Although an automobile should obviously function as a means of transportation, human-centered designers emphasize the [[Experience design|experiences]] of driving, [[Usability|ease of operation]], feeling of safety, including the social meanings of driving a particular automobile. As artifacts have to work within many dimensions, human-centered designers must have a sense of and be able to work with all relevant stakeholders addressing different dimensions of the artifact.

==''The Semantic Turn'': a book and its themes==
'''''The Semantic Turn''''' is also the title of a book by [[Klaus Krippendorff]],&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff, Klaus (2006). ''The Semantic Turn; A New Foundation for Design''. Boca Raton, London, New York: Taylor&amp;Francis, CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Communication at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], cybernetician, degreed designer, and researcher who has published much to advance the science for design. The subtitle of the book, ''A new Foundation for Design'', suggests a redesign of design practices in a human-centered design culture. Krippendorff takes an encompassing view of design, centering it on the meanings that artifacts acquire and what is or should be designers' primary concern.

''The Semantic Turn'' represents an evolution from "Product Semantics" by Krippendorff and Butter,&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff, Klaus &amp; Butter, Reinhart (Eds.) (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; which was defined as ''"A systematic inquiry into how people attribute meanings to artifacts and interact with them accordingly"'' and ''"a vocabulary and methodology for designing artifacts in view of the meanings they could acquire for their users and the communities of their stakeholders"''. While retaining the emphasis on meaning and on the importance of both theory and practice, ''The Semantic Turn'' extends the concerns of designers first to the new challenges of design, including the design of ever more intangible artifacts such as services, identities, interfaces, multi-user systems, projects and discourses; and second, to consider the meaning of artifacts in use, in language, in the whole life cycle of the artifact, and in an ecology of artifacts.

===Design===
For Krippendorff, design ''"brings forth what would not come naturally (...); proposes realizable artifacts to others (...) must support the lives of ideally large communities (...) and must make sense to most, ideally to all who have a stake on them"''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Design thus is intimatelly involved with the meaning that stakeholders attribute to artifacts. Designers ''"consider possible futures (...) evaluate their desirability (...) and create and work out realistic paths from the present towards desirable futures, and propose them to those that can bring a design to fruition"''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging that all design serves others, ''The Semantic Turn'' does not treat THE user as statistical fiction, but as knowledgeable stakeholders and necessary partners in human-centered design processes.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predecessors of human-centeredness===
Krippendorff quotes the Greek philosopher Protagoras who is believed to have been the first to express human-centeredness in words by saying that ''"Man is the measure of all things, of things that are (...) and of things that are not (...)."'' Krippendorff goes on to cite the color theory of J. W. von Goethe&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich, Theodor, et al. (Ed.) (undated). Goethe. Vierzigster Teil: Zur Farbenlehre.(original 1810). Leipzig: Verlag Reclam.&lt;/ref&gt; who exposed Isaac Newton’s spectral theory of colors as epistemologically flawed by pointing out that color is the product of the human eye. Color does not exist without it. Krippendorff refers to the Italian philosopher G. Vico for opposing R.

Carroll (Ed.). New York: John Wiley and MIT.&lt;/ref&gt; Most important, Krippendorff allies himself with L. Wittgenstein’s definition of meaning as use,&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig (1953). Philosophical Investigations. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in the axiom that ''Humans do not see and act on the physical qualities of things, but on what they mean to them''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning===
Attributing meaning to something follows from sensing it, and is a prelude to action. ''" One always acts according to the meaning of whatever one faces "''&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 58&lt;/ref&gt; and the consequences of these actions in turn become part of the meanings of what one interacts with. Meanings are always someone's construction and depend on context and culture. The same artifact may invoke different meanings at different times, in different contexts of use, and for different people. To design artifacts for use by others calls on designers to understand the understanding of others, a ''second order understanding'' that is fundamentally unlike the understanding of physical things. Since meanings cannot be observed directly, designers need to carefully observe the actions that imply certain meanings; involve themselves in dialog with their stakeholders; and invite them to participate in the design process.

===Meaning of artifacts in use===
People acquire the meanings of artifacts by their interfacing with them, where meanings become anticipated usabilities. Krippendorff does not limit the concept of interfaces to human computer interactions, however. For him, the concept applies to any artifact one faces. To users, artifacts are perceived as affordances, as the kind of interactions they enable or prohibit. Thus scissors and coffee cups are experienced as interfaces, just as personal computers are. Their physical or computational makeup become background phenomena to use. The meaning of an artifact in use is then ''" the range of imaginable senses and actions that users have reasons to expect" ''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Ideal interfaces are self-evident and ''" intrinsically motivating interactions between users and their artifacts" ''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on Heidegger's explorations of the human use of technology, Krippendorff argues that all artifacts must be designed to afford three stages of use: initial recognition, intermediate exploration, and ideally, unproblematic reliance. The latter is achieved when the artifact is so incorporated into the user's world that it becomes hardly noticed, is taken for granted while looking through it to what is to be accomplished. Recognition involves users' categorizations, how close the artifact is to the ''ideal type'' of its kind. Exploration is facilitated by informatives such as state indicators, progress reports, confirmations of actions and readiness, alarm signals, close correlations between actions and their expected effects, maps of possibilities, instructions, error messages, and multi-sensory feedback. Users' intrinsic motivation arises from reliance, the seemingly effortless, unproblematic yet skillful engagement with artifacts free of disruptions. A well designed interface enables unambiguous recognition, effective exploration, and leads to enjoyable reliance. To accomplish these transitions, human-centered designers need to involve second-order understanding of users' cognitive models, cultural habits, and competencies.

Typically, users approach their artifacts with very different competencies. ''The Semantic Turn'' offers the possibility of accommodating these differences by allowing the design of several semantic layers. For example, contemporary Xerox machines exhibit one layer for making copies, another for clearing paper jams, a third for replacing defective parts by trained service personnel, and a fourth is reserved for the factory repair of replaced components.

===Meaning of artifacts in language===
''"The fate of all artifacts is decided in language" '',&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 148&lt;/ref&gt; says Krippedorff. Indeed, designers must pay attention to the narratives in which an artifact appears as soon as it enters the conversations among stakeholders, bystanders, critics, and users, to the names that categorize the artifact as being of one kind or another, and to the adjectives that direct perception to particular qualities (is it a ''fast'' car? a ''clumsy'' cell phone? a ''high class'' dress?). Such characterizations can make or break an artifact and designers cannot ignore how people talk about them. Krippendorff proposes that ''artifacts should be designed so that their interfaces are [easily] narratable''&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 147, emphasis added&lt;/ref&gt; and fit into social or communicational relationships.

The ''character'' of an artifact – the set of adjectives deemed appropriate to it – can be assessed by means of semantic differential scales – seven point scales between polar opposite attributes such as elegant––––graceless; by categorizing free associations elicited from users, whether as first impressions or after extended use; by examining the content of stories people tell about the artifacts for implied judgments; or by pair comparisons of similar artifacts. Such methods give human-centered designers ways to quantify meanings, to work towards defined design criteria, including pursuing quantifiable aesthetic objectives, and justify a design to potential stakeholders.

Language permeates all of human life, including with artifacts. This applies not only to the users of artifacts but also to their designers. The narratives that evolve within design teams determine the direction a design is taking, and might end up convincing stakeholders to go along with a design project or oppose it, well before it is built, and influence designers in turn. What we know of current artifacts, ancient ones, outdated ones, antiques or museum pieces come to us in the form of stories. Designers need to analyse them for, as Krippendorff asserts, ''" The meanings that artifacts acquire in use are largely framed in language"''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning in the lives of artifacts===
Here, Krippendorff invites designers to consider artifacts in their whole life cycle. In the case of industrial products, the life cycle might start with an initial idea, then followed by design, engineering, production, sales, use, storage, maintenance and finally retirement, as recycled or as waste. Well, not so "finally;" designers may learn much about a product's performance, unintended uses, unexpected problems, and resulting social consequences, which can serve to improve the design of the next generation of that product – design never ends. In each phase of the life cycle of an artifact, that artifact will have to support diverse but subjectively meaningful interfaces for different communities of stakeholders. In such stakeholder networks, artifacts need to proceed from one to the next: ''" no artifact can be realized within a culture without being meaningful to those who can move it through its various definitions" ''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning in an ecology of artifacts===
Dictionaries tend to define ecology as multi-species interaction in a common environment, the species being animals and plants. Humans, however, have created a perhaps greater diversity of ''species of artifacts'' than has nature. Krippendorff observes that species of artifacts too are born, grow in size and number, diversify into sub-species, associate with other species, adapt to each other and to their human environment, and either reproduce, evolve, or disappear – just as in nature. Species of artifacts may compete, cooperate or be parasitic on other artifacts. For an example of the latter, consider spam, which thrives in the email ecosystem and could not exist outside it. Whereas species of animals and plants interact with one another in their own terms, species of artifacts are brought into interaction through human agency. People arrange artifacts, like the furniture at home; connect them into networks, like computes in the internet; form large cultural cooperatives, like hospitals full of medical equipment, drugs, and treatments; retire one species in favor of another, like typewriters gave way to personal computers; or change their ecological meanings, like horses, originally used for work and transportation, found an ecological niche in sports.

In an ecology of artifacts, the meaning of one consists of the possible interactions with other artifacts: cooperation, competition (substitution), domination or submission, leading technological development, like computers do right now, supporting the leaders, like the gadgets found in computer stores. Similarly, roads and gas stations follow the development of automobiles and participate in a very large cultural complex, including the design of cities and the distribution of work, and affect nature through depletion of resources, creating waste and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Clearly, ''" designers who can handle the ecological meaning of their proposals have a better chance of keeping their designs alive" ''.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Towards a science for design==
In 1969, Nobel laureate Herbert Simon called for a science of the artificial.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Herbert A. (1969/2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Natural scientists, he argued, are concerned with what exists, whereas designers are concerned with what should be and how to achieve it. His conception of design was shaped by rational decision theory and early conceptions of computational logic, hence limited largely to technology-centered design. Krippendorff added the following contrasts to Simon’s:
* The natural sciences limit themselves to theorizing past regularities from existing data. They do not see scientists as change agents. Any science for design must concern itself with how designers can change existing regularities, overcome contingencies that cause recurring problems, and make a difference in the lives of present stakeholders or future communities. Designers do not produce theories but propose unprecedented artifacts, new practices, and narratives that must be realized in a network of stakeholders, which are actors in their own interest. The science for design cannot be ''about'' design or ''of'' design, which are pursued from outside the design community. It must provide practical and intellectual support of design by being ''for'' or in the service of design activity. In support of change that does not come naturally, it must also provide the conceptualizations needed to hold designers accountable for how their proposals affect future contingencies.
* The natural sciences privilege causal explanations, which rule out that their objects can understand how they are conceptualized, theorized, and studied. A science for human-centered design privileges the meanings (conceptions, explanations, and motivations) that knowledgeable users and stakeholders of a design can bring to it. It entails a reflexive kind of understanding unfamiliar in the natural sciences.
* As detached observers of their objects, natural scientists can afford to celebrate abstract and general theories. Designers, by contrast, must be concerned with all necessary details of their design. No technology works in the abstract. Even social artifacts need to be understood and enacted by their constituents. A design is always a proposal to other stakeholders who may contribute to a design or oppose its realization. Theories in the natural sciences do not affect what they theorize, but designs must enroll others into what they are proposing, treat them as intelligent agents, or will not come to fruition.
* In the natural sciences, research consists of gathering date or objective facts in support of theories about these data. Predictive theories assume the status quo (the continuation) of the phenomena they theorize. In the science for design, research means searching for previously unrecognized variables and proposing realistic paths into desirable futures. Design, to the extent it is innovative, may well break with past theories, overcome popular convictions, and challenge stubborn beliefs in a history-determined future. Fundamentally, past observations can never prove the validity of truly innovative designs.

A science for design makes three contributions to design:

===Design research===
Generally, research is any inquiry that generates communicable knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Bruce (1995) [https://archive.org/details/TheNatureOfResearch], accessed 2009.10.15&lt;/ref&gt; Human-centered [[design research]] typically involves
* Eliciting and analyzing the narratives of problematic uses of artifacts and desirable futures, which motivate or inspire a community of potential users and stakeholders to consider changes in their lives.
* Searching for and evaluating examples of common, understandable, and attractive practices, especially from empirical domains other than the intended design, in view of their ability to serve as metaphors for new but immediately recognizable and meaningful interfaces.
* Exploring new technologies and materials that could support or improve current and future uses of the artifacts under consideration.
* Testing and evaluating alternative designs – recombinations and transformations of available technologies, possible interfaces, and social and ecological consequences – usually in terms relevant to present stakeholders and in lieu of future users.
* Inquiring into how a design survives in the ecology of artifacts, what lessons can be learned for future design activities, so called post-design research.

===Design methods===
Human-centered [[design methods]] may aim at:
* Systematic expansions of a design space – the possibilities in which a design can take place. This space should embrace and go beyond user and stakeholder expectations, especially including the (apparently) unthinkable. Such methods range from the computer generation of alternatives ([[Enumerative combinatorics|combinatorics]]) to the use of language games during which novel ideas are created, for example by [[brainstorming]].
* Focused involvement of users and stakeholders in the design process (in reducing the design space to realistic proposals for meaningful artifacts). There are three known ways:
** Acquiring an understanding of users’ and stakeholders’ understanding, so-called second-order understanding, for instance by [[Ethnography|ethnographic research]] or [[focus group]]s, and making design decisions dependent on that understanding
** Involving users and stakeholders in design decisions, for example, [[participatory design]]
** Delegating design by designing artifacts that either adapt themselves to their users’ and stakeholders’ worlds or can be redesigned by them, in personal computers, for example.
* Formalizing successful design practices into reproducible aids that can improve future design practices, both computationally, for example, [[Computer-aided design|computer aided design]], [[Computer supported cooperative work|collaborative software]], and [[rapid prototyping]], and prescriptively. Krippendorff describes five prescriptive methods:&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 230–260&lt;/ref&gt;
** (Re)designing the characters of artifacts
** Designing interfaces for artifacts in view of their usability and meanings in use
** Designing novel artifacts, including services and social practices, from sensible narratives and metaphors
** Designing design strategies
** Designing dialogical (collaborative) methodologies to involve others in a design process.
* Elaborating and refining the design discourse in order to
** Improve the reproducibility of knowledge about the design process, by generating retrievable records of past accounts of design processes and publishing pertinent findings
** Make the collaboration among designers as well as in interdisciplinary teams more efficient
** Inform pertinent design education
** Enhance the ability to ask fruitful research questions for which design research may provide conclusive answers
** Increase and maintain the reputation of professional design, especially in order for designers to play important roles within the network of its stakeholders. This means applying the science for design to itself.

===Validations of semantic claims===
In a science for design, validation consists of generating compelling justifications for the claims that designers must make regarding the meaning, virtue, potential reality, costs and benefits of their design for particular communities.&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff (2006), pp. 260–267&lt;/ref&gt; Inasmuch as any design can prove itself only in the future, ''post factum'', and with the collaboration of others, human-centered design is justifiable only by means of plausible arguments [[Issue-Based Information System]]&lt;ref&gt;Rittel, Horst W. J. (1992). ''Planen, Entwerfen, Design; Ausgewȁhlte Schriften zur Theorie und Methodik ''. Wolf D. Reuter (Ed.). Stuttgart, Berlin, Kȍln: W. Kohlhammer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rittel, Horst W. J. &amp; Webber, Melvin M.. (1984). Planning problems are wicked problems. In Cross, Nigel (Ed.). ''Developments in design methodology''. New York: Wiley, pp. 135–144.&lt;/ref&gt; that motivate its stakeholders to realize or use that design. The science for design, always concerned with not yet observable contingencies, cannot provide the simple truth claims of the kind that natural scientist aspire to for their theories. But it can provide several other human-centered ways to back the claims designers need to make:
* Convincing demonstrations and expositions of a design in various contexts of use
* Statistical experiments with prototypes, models or visualizations involving users’ ability to make sense of, find appropriate meanings for, and handle a proposed artifact
* Appeals to trusted theories or principles of how meanings of artifacts are acquired in use, can be communicated through various channels, or emerge in a diversity of social situations, including in an ecology of other artifacts
* Accounts of the systematic application of established design methods that reduced the initial design space to the alternatives being proposed
* Affirmed commitments by relevant stakeholders to realize the design.

==Reception of "product semantics" and ''The Semantic Turn''==
Since its coinage in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;Krippendorff, Klaus &amp; Butter, Reinhart (1984). Exploring the Symbolic Qualities of Form. ''Innovations 3'', 2 pp. 4–9. [http://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/40], accessed 2009.10.15.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of “product semantics” has mushroomed. In 2009, a Google search identified over 18,000 documents referring to it. However, it has been critiqued by advocates of a more critical approach to design as overly simplistic.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

The semantics of artifacts has become of central importance in courses taught at leading design departments of many universities all over the world, among them at the Arizona State University; the Cranbrook Academy of Arts; The Ohio State University; the Savannah College of Art and Design; the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, USA; the Hochschule fűr Gestaltung Offenbach in Germany;&lt;ref&gt;Steffen, Dagmar (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; the Hongik University in Seoul, Korea; the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai; the Musashino Art University in Tokyo, Japan; the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology; the University of Art and Design in Helsinki, Finland; and more. It has also permeated other disciplines, notably [[ergonomics]], [[marketing]], [[Cognitive ergonomics|cognitive engineering]].

'''''The Union of Earth and Water'''''  is a [[Baroque]] painting by Flemish artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]], showing [[Cybele]] as the personification of earth holding the [[Cornucopia|horn of plenty]] and [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] as the personification of water in the center.
&lt;ref name="herm"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/01.+Paintings/48135/?lng=ru|title=Союз Земли и Воды|publisher=Hermitage Museum | language=Russian| accessdate =9 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair is crowned by the goddess [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] and the union is heralded through a conch by the [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] below.&lt;ref name="herm"/&gt; The union symbolizes fertility, wealth and prosperity, specifically the city of [[Antwerp]] and the river [[Scheldt]] whose mouth in Rubens' times was blocked by the Dutch depriving [[Flanders]] of the access to the sea.&lt;ref name="herm"/&gt; The painting features a pyramidal composition, symmetry and the balance of forms. It was influenced by late [[Italian Renaissance]], particularly by Venetian artists.&lt;ref name="herm"/&gt;

A smaller copy of the painting made in the Rubens' workshop was owned by the Russian businessman Vladimir Logvinenko. Following the abolition of a thirty per cent [[import duty]] on artworks in 2004, Logvinenko brought the copy from London to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.forbes.ru/forbes/issue/2005-09/18743-i-spas-i-rubens|title=И Спас, и Рубенс|publisher=[[Forbes]]|author=Максим Кашулинский| language=Russian|date=3 Sep 2005| accessdate =9 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting is housed in the Rubens Hall of the [[Hermitage Museum]], Russia. Previously it had been in the Chigi Collection in Rome from which it was acquired by the Hermitage Museum between 1798 and 1800.

'''UNIMA''' (''Union Internationale de la Marionnette'' - ''International Puppetry Association'') was founded in [[Prague]] in 1929 (the then Czechoslovak magazine [[Loutkář]] was UNIMA's first official journal in years 1929-1930). In 1981, the French puppeteer Jacques Félix moved UNIMA's headquarters to [[Charleville-Mézières]], [[France]], location of the ''Festival Mondial des Théâtres de Marionnettes'' since 1972. UNIMA is affiliated to [[UNESCO]] and it is a member of the [[International Theatre Institute]].

== Plot ==
Halla, a choir conductor, wants to disrupt the operations of a [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] aluminium plant in the [[Iceland]]ic highlands. She repeatedly damages pylons and wires to cut their power supply. One day, a long-forgotten application to adopt an orphan child from [[Ukraine]] is approved. At the same time, the government ramps up police and propaganda efforts in order to catch and discredit her. 
The film revolves around her attempts to reconcile her dangerous and illegal activism with the upcoming adoption.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/12/woman-at-war-review-benedikt-erlingsson-horses-men-icelandic-drama-pylon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety"/&gt;

==Reception==
Peter Bradshaw, for [[The Guardian]], praised Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir's 'attractive and sympathetic performance' as Halla, and called the overall film a 'well-turned, well-tuned oddity' that was 'confidently and rather stylishly made'.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

Jay Weissberg, for [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], called the film 'a delightful follow-up to  ''[[Of Horses and Men]]''', and praised the director for 'arranging beautifully shot picaresque episodes around a central figure who lives the ideals of the heroes she has hanging on her wall, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]'.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/woman-at-war-review-1202808656/&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, '''X''' is or has been a [[Motion picture rating system|motion picture rating]] reserved for the most explicit films. Films rated X are intended only for viewing by adults, usually defined as people over the age of 18 or 21.

==Australia==
The [[Australian Classification Board]] (ACB, formerly known as the OFLC), a government institution, issues ratings for all movies and television shows exhibited, televised, sold, or hired in Australia. Material showing explicit, non-simulated sex that is pornographic in nature is rated '''X18+'''.

People under 18 may not buy, rent, exhibit, or view these films. The exhibition or sale of these films to people under the age of 18 years is a criminal offence carrying a maximum fine of $5,500. Films classified as X18+ are banned from being sold or rented in most [[Australian states]]. They are legally available to be sold or hired in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[Northern Territory]]. Importing X18+ material from these territories to any of the Australian states is legal, as the [[Constitution of Australia|constitution]] forbids any restrictions on trade between the states and territories.

==France==
Films may be shown in theaters in France only after classification by an administrative commission of the [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]]. In 1975, the '''X classification''' (officially: "pornographic or violence-inciting movies") was created for pornographic movies, or movies with successions of scenes of graphic violence. The commission has some leeway in classification; it may for instance take into account the artistic qualities of a movie not to count it pornographic. Movies with an X rating may only be shown in specific theaters (which hardly exist nowadays in France); they bear special taxes and tax rates, including a 33% tax on revenue.

In 2000, some conservative associations sued the government for granting the movie ''[[Baise-moi]]'', which contained graphic, realistic scenes of sex and violence, a non-X classification. The [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] ruled that the movie should have been rated X. The decision was highly controversial, and some suggested changing the law under which it was rated 18.

==United Kingdom==
{{main|History of British film certificates}}
The original '''X certificate''', replacing the [[H certificate]], was issued between 1951 and 1982 by the [[British Board of Film Censors]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was introduced as a result of the [[Wheare Report]] on film censorship. From 1951 to 1970, it meant "Suitable for those aged 16 and over," and from 1970 to 1982 it was redefined as meaning "Suitable for those aged 18 and over". The X certificate was replaced in November 1982 by the [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 certificate]].

Sometimes the rating of a film has changed significantly over time. For example, the French film  ''[[Jules and Jim]]'' received an X rating in 1962 that was changed to a [[Rated PG|PG]] rating in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/search/releases/Jules%2Band%2BJim "Jules and Jim"], British Board of Film Classification&lt;/ref&gt; In some early cases, films politically motivated received an X rating. ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' was rejected for "inflammatory subtitles and [[Bolshevist|Bolshevik]] propaganda" in 1926, rated X in 1954, and finally rated PG in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbbfc.co.uk/CaseStudies/Battleship_Potemkin Case Study:Battleship Potemkin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301233439/http://www.sbbfc.co.uk/CaseStudies/Battleship_Potemkin |date=March 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
In the [[United States]], the '''X rating''' was applied to a film that contained content judged unsuitable for [[children]], such as extreme violence, strongly implied sex, and graphic language. When the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA film rating system]] began in America on November 1, 1968, the X rating was given to a film by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] if submitted to it or, due to its non-trademarked status, it could be self-applied to a film by a distributor that knew beforehand that its film contained content unsuitable for minors. From the [[New Hollywood|late 1960s]] to about the [[1980s in film|mid-1980s]], many mainstream films were released with an X rating such as ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', ''[[Medium Cool]]'', ''[[Last Summer]]'', ''[[Last of the Mobile Hot Shots]]'', ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Dolls]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]'', ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'', ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' and ''[[The Evil Dead (1981 film)|The Evil Dead]]''. (Films that achieved critical and commercial success were later re-rated R after minor cuts, including ''Midnight Cowboy'' and ''A Clockwork Orange.'') The threat of an X rating also encouraged filmmakers to [[Re-edited film|re-edit]] their films to achieve an R rating; one notable example of this was the 1987 satirical action film ''[[RoboCop]]'', which had to be edited eleven times before it could attain an R rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzBkjTxD1a0 |title=Backstory RoboCop AMC |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718170224/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzBkjTxD1a0 |archivedate=July 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the X rating was not trademarked, anybody could apply it to their films, including pornographers, as many began to do in the 1970s. As [[pornography]] began to become chic and more legally and commercially tolerated, pornographers placed an X rating on their films to emphasize the adult content. Some even started using multiple X's (i.e. XX, XXX, etc.) to give the impression that their film contained more graphic sexual content than the simple X rating. In some cases, the X ratings were applied by reviewers or film scholars, e.g. [[William Rotsler]], who wrote "The XXX-rating means [[Hardcore pornography|hard-core]], the XX-rating is for [[Softcore pornography|simulation]], and an X-rating is for comparatively cool films."&lt;ref&gt;Rotslter, William. ''Contemporary Erotic Cinema''. New York: [[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]/[[Ballantine Books]], 1973. page 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing beyond the simple X rating has ever been officially recognized by the MPAA. Because of the heavy use of the X rating by pornographers, it became associated largely with pornographic films, so that non-pornographic films given an X rating would have fewer theaters willing to book them and fewer venues for advertising. Moreover, many newspapers refused to advertise X rated films. This led to a number of films being released unrated sometimes with a warning that the film contained content for adults only. In response, the MPAA eventually agreed in 1990 to a new [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#X replaced by NC-17|NC-17]] rating that would be trademarked, and could only be applied by the MPAA itself. By [[trademark]]ing the rating, the MPAA committed to defending an NC-17 film charged with violating obscenity laws.
